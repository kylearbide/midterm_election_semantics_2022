HONORING SARAH LUMPKIN ON 
HER RETIREMENT 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CAR-
TER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
amazing public servant. The city clerk 
of Hinesville, Sarah Lumpkin, is retir-
ing after over three decades of service 
in local government. 
Sarah began her career with the city 
of Hinesville when she joined the city 
team as an accounts payable clerk and 
rose to the rank of assistant city clerk 
by 1991. 
Throughout her career, she accumu-
lated a long list of awards and accom-
plishments, including being named the 
first recipient of the Hinesville City 
Hall Employee of the Year Award in 
1994, and being designated Certified 
Municipal Clerk by the International 
Institute of Municipal Clerks in 1996. 
She took her leadership skills to new 
heights when she served as president of 
the Georgia Municipal Clerks and Fi-
nance Officers Association of the State 
of Georgia from 2006 to 2007. 
Sarah’s 
guidance 
and 
expertise 
throughout her career paved the way 
for tremendous growth and success for 
the city of Hinesville, and I am very 
grateful for all she accomplished. 
I wish her the best of luck as she be-
gins her retirement. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO BRITNEE KINARD 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
SD Gunner Fund’s Britnee Kinard for 
receiving 
the 
President’s 
Lifetime 
Achievement Award because of her out-
standing service to fellow Americans. 
The AmeriCorps President’s Lifetime 
Achievement Award is the highest 
honor of the President’s Volunteer 
Service Award and it recognizes indi-
viduals, 
families, 
and 
groups 
who 
achieve a remarkable number of serv-
ice hours. 
In receiving the lifetime achievement 
award, Britnee is being recognized for 
her over 4,000 hours of service to ensure 
the 
continuation 
of 
America’s 
unrivaled commitment to improving 
countless lives. 
Britnee is the founder and president 
of SD Gunner Fund, which is an incred-
ible organization that assists veterans, 
exceptional children, and first respond-
ers in receiving vital resources, such as 
service dogs, therapy dogs, emergency 
assistance, community advocacy and 
education, and much more. 
She was inspired to start the success-
ful SD Gunner Fund when she left her 
high-profile career in business to be-
come a full-time caregiver to her hus-
band after he suffered life-altering in-
juries while serving our country in Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom. 
I want to thank Britnee for her self-
less commitment to service through 
SD Gunner Fund, and I wish her the 
best. I am extremely proud to have 
Britnee here in the First Congressional 
District of Georgia. 
NATIONAL PHARMACIST DAY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Na-
tional Pharmacist Day, which takes 
place in January annually to recognize 
and honor pharmacists across the Na-
tion. 
As a pharmacist myself, I thoroughly 
understand the role each pharmacist 
plays as an integrated member of the 
healthcare team. Every day, phar-
macists are directly involved in pa-
tient care, and pharmacists are the 
most 
accessible 
healthcare 
profes-
sionals in the country. Ninety-five per-
cent of Americans live within 5 miles 
of a pharmacy. 
As we battle COVID–19, pharmacists 
should be recognized, as they are on 
the front lines dispensing the vaccine. 
Because of their work, lives will be 
saved. They have been vital resources 
throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, 
and they will continue to play an ac-
tive role in combating the virus. 
I ask that you join me in recognizing 
all pharmacists by thanking them for 
their work.

THANK YOU, JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
DEMINGS). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
this past Sunday was Bloody Sunday. 
For some who are not familiar with 
that terminology, the Congressional 
Black Caucus did a special tribute last 
evening. But I think it is also a rec-
ognition that elections count, deter-
mination counts, conscience counts. 
So this morning I want to emphasize 
Bloody Sunday and what it really 
meant. It was, in fact, to restore or to 
initiate or to give Americans the free 
and equal right to vote. The late John 
Lewis, our friend, our brother, the con-
science of the Congress, may not have 
known what historical steps he was 
walking in when he stared down the 
Alabama State Troopers standing with 
Hosea Williams and Albert Turner and 
other foot soldiers, staring them down 
because voting counts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1126 
March 9, 2021 
I rise to pay tribute to that kind of 
determination. As we proceed to debate 
the American rescue package, I want 
the Members, my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, to recognize that elec-
tions count, that people are looking for 
us to stare down the devastation of 
COVID–19, the devastation of poverty, 
and the devastation of lack of jobs. 
They are looking for diversity in 
terms of vaccinations, reaching out to 
neighborhoods. They are looking for 
the child tax credit, the earned income 
tax credit, and that is because John 
Lewis stood tall for the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act. 
In fact, after that Bloody Sunday, 
President Johnson rose to this podium 
and said: ‘‘I speak tonight for the dig-
nity of man and the destiny of democ-
racy. . . . At times, history and fate 
meet at a single time in a single place 
to shape a turning point in man’s 
unending search for freedom. So it was 
at Lexington and Concord. So it was a 
century ago at Appomattox. So it was 
last week in Selma, Alabama.’’ 
So when we debate, I want us to be 
reminded that people died for the Vot-
ing Rights Act because elections count: 
people like Jimmie Lee Jackson, who 
was shot by a State trooper in Marion, 
Alabama, after a peaceful rally to vote; 
women like Viola Liuzzo, a Detroit 
housewife who was driving people back 
and forth between Montgomery and 
Selma. She, a mother of 5, was shot to 
death. 
So today I rise to emphasize that 
Bloody Sunday is not just Bloody Sun-
day. It is a continuation of the fight 
for justice and the fight for voting 
rights. It is what we will do tomorrow. 
It is the PRO Act. It is the Violence 
Against Women Act. It is the vote for 
the American rescue package that does 
not disallow the fact that all Ameri-
cans, those impoverished, those who 
have lost loved ones to COVID–19, 
those teachers who want to get in the 
classroom and teach. All of this will be 
part of the American rescue package. 
Thank you, John Lewis, for begin-
ning to tell us what America should be 
and what America can be. It is because 
of that kind of strength that we are 
here today. To John Lewis, we commit 
to you to pass H.R. 1 in the Senate, to 
pass the Voting Rights Act enhance-
ment number four, after Shelby, Ala-
bama, destroyed and undermined the 
very strength of the Voting Rights Act. 
Because we would not be here today; 
we would not have the opportunity to 
have the American rescue package; we 
would not have the opportunity to 
have the Violence Against Women Act; 
we would not have the opportunity to 
have the George Floyd Justice in Polic-
ing Act, whose family was here last 
week when we debated it, if we did not 
have the right to vote. 
So it is my belief today that, as we 
go into this debate, as we go into the 
rest of the week, as we vote for the uni-
versal background checks and the 
Charleston, South Carolina, closing the 
loophole, it is not a frivolous authority 
or power that we utilize. It is because 
people were willing to be beaten and to 
be almost killed, but certainly un-
bowed, as Shirley Chisholm said, for 
the precious right to vote. 
Bloody Sunday may be one day, 
March 7, but all the years that I have 
gone and crossed the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge, chosen to highlight a Confed-
erate segregationist, but we turned 
that lemon into lemonade. When thou-
sands and thousands and thousands 
every year marched across that Ed-
mund 
Pettus 
Bridge, 
we 
weren’t 
marching for segregation, we weren’t 
marching for the violence that was per-
petrated against the foot soldiers year 
after year. We were marching for free-
dom and the right to vote. 
So this right to vote will be exercised 
on the floor of the House this week. I 
ask and beg my colleagues to join us in 
what is good. Join us in the American 
rescue package. Join us in the PRO 
Act. Join us in the universal back-
ground checks. Join us in closing the 
Charleston loophole. Join us next week 
in the Violence Against Women Act. 
Join us to make America the country 
of John Robert Lewis, standing for 
what is good. 
Madam Speaker, I know we will do 
good and get into good trouble. 
f 
A QUESTION OF LIFE AND DEATH 
IN TEXAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise, a proud, liberated 
Democrat unbought and unbossed. 
I rise today to address the question 
of life and death, the question associ-
ated with the Governor of the State of 
Texas indicating that on tomorrow 
people may go out into the public and 
to public venues without a mask. He is 
leaving it to the public to make deci-
sions associated with life and death. 
Life and death in Texas because the 7- 
day average for hospitalizations is 
6,000. The number of people that died 
on last Sunday was 65. Life and death. 
And he leaves it in the hands of people 
who may somehow believe that he is 
risking his life. Not so. Not to the ex-
tent that the public will be, those who 
haven’t been vaccinated because on De-
cember 22 of last year the Governor 
was vaccinated. 
The Governor has resources. If by 
chance he should contract the virus, 
the Governor will have access to the 
finest medical care in the world. The 
Governor will get to the hospital expe-
ditiously either by some car that will 
have some officer driving at a high rate 
of speed because the road will be 
cleared for him or he will pursue his 
needs by way of helicopter. The Gov-
ernor has resources. 
Better example. The former Presi-
dent, who called the virus a hoax, when 
he contracted the virus, he went to the 
finest medical center, received the fin-
est medical care, and he survived. 
His friend, who attended one of his 
rallies and 9 days later contracted the 
virus, died. This is a matter of life and 
death. The virus has not dissipated. It 
has not gone away. 
So to the people of Texas, I love you, 
but I say this to you: If you don’t have 
the resources that the Governor has, if 
you don’t have a helicopter, if you 
don’t have access to the best medical 
care in the world, if you don’t have a 
doctor that will be waiting on you 
when you get to the hospital, if you 
have to go to the emergency room—the 
Governor won’t go to the emergency 
room, he will bypass that. 
So if you can bypass the emergency 
room and you can have the finest med-
ical care in the world, maybe you 
should 
consider 
going 
into 
public 
venues without a mask. But if not, re-
member, it is a question of life and 
death, and the life you save may very 
well be your own.

PANDEMIC 
HELP 
AND 
TESTING 
FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAM-
ILIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I am 
so proud of the wins in the American 
Rescue Plan, and in particular with 
what this means for America’s chil-
dren. As a pediatrician, my life’s work 
has been the health and the wellbeing 
of children. 
This pandemic has been particularly 
hard for children and families. The 
most important thing we can do to 
bring relief to our communities is to 
end the pandemic. This means getting 
shots into as many arms as possible as 
quickly as we can. It also means taking 
steps now to ensure that when children 
return to the classroom, our schools 
and our small businesses can stay safe 
and stay open. 
Testing is key to keeping our schools 
and workplaces safe. And, frankly, we 
have not used testing in a way that sig-
nificantly curbs the spread of this dis-
ease. Rapid home testing, in particular, 
is a critical public health tool that we 
have yet to really deploy. And there is 
funding in the American rescue pack-
age to support more strategic wide-
spread testing. 
Rapid tests can give results in about 
15 minutes, and they can be done at 
home. Imagine testing in the morning 
before brushing your teeth. By the 
time you are done with breakfast you 
would have a result. If positive, you 
would stay home and avoid spreading 
coronavirus to others. This is how we 
break the chain of transmission and 
starve the virus. What we need now is 
to get these tests evaluated, approved, 
scaled up and priced such that every-
one can use them two to three times a 
week. Frequent testing means you will 
catch infections early while people are

still asymptomatic and would other-
wise unknowingly be spreading them to 
others. 
The technology is inexpensive and is 
similar to that used in pregnancy tests. 
In fact, these tests can be produced in 
bulk for a dollar or two per test. But 
we need investment from the Federal 
Government 
in 
doing 
head-to-head 
comparisons to determine which tests 
are the best, and then production and 
procurement of those best tests on a 
massive scale. 
This is a new virus. Variants have al-
ready emerged that make it more con-
tagious. More are sure to come. It will 
be close to a year before all of our chil-
dren are vaccinated. Now, frequent 
rapid testing is a way to identify in-
fected children and staff before they 
get symptoms and keep them at home 
so they can’t infect others. It can give 
staff and families confidence that our 
schools are safe. It can also give an 
early warning of outbreaks. Now, imag-
ine what this sort of testing could 
mean for workplaces, for restaurants, 
and for theaters. 
The American Rescue Plan does more 
than strengthen our vaccines and test-
ing though. It provides critical relief 
that families need right now. 
We are in one of the worst economic 
downturns this country has ever seen, 
and the American Rescue Plan provides 
help 
where 
it 
is 
most 
needed, 
prioritizing children and families. 
This plan shores up the child tax 
credit and provides it up front as a 
monthly check for up to $300 per child. 
This is a very big deal. More than 93 
percent of children and families will 
benefit, including the poorest 10 per-
cent, who currently get no benefits be-
cause their parents’ income is too low 
to qualify. These are the families who 
need the help the most. This provision 
alone will cut the number of children 
living in poverty in half. 
It also shores up SNAP benefits and 
incorporates my bill to expand WIC, so 
that children can get good nutrition 
and enough of it to power their brains 
and their bodies. It provides cash bene-
fits and enhanced unemployment bene-
fits that will help the hardest-hit fami-
lies the most, and it gets even more 
help to families with children. 
It expands Medicaid in States that 
haven’t already and makes it easier for 
people to afford and sign up for health 
insurance. 
And finally, it provides resources to 
schools so that educators, staff, chil-
dren, and their families feel confident 
that they are returning to classrooms 
safely. And it expands broadband ac-
cess at home to narrow the digital di-
vide. 
The American Rescue Plan is a win 
for the country. It meets the moment, 
and it focuses relief on the people and 
businesses hardest hit by the economic 
and social fallout from this pandemic. 
Important to this pediatrician, it helps 
families and children with bold policy 
changes we have always needed but 
that have become even more urgent 
during this crisis. 
UNIONS WILL HELP REBUILD THE 
MIDDLE CLASS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, later today we will debate the 
PRO Act, and we will pass the PRO Act 
to free up American workers to form 
unions and bargain collectively just be-
cause they darn well please without in-
terference from their employer. And 
when we debate the PRO Act, Madam 
Speaker, we will get into all the details 
of the provisions of the PRO Act, which 
are really incredible, and I am very ex-
cited about that. 
But right now, I want to talk about 
what a difference the PRO Act would 
make, why it would be a game changer 
for the working people of this country. 
First of all, let’s talk about produc-
tivity. American workers are incred-
ibly productive. In the whole period 
during and after World War II when 
Americans 
were 
forming 
unions, 
thanks to the National Labor Rela-
tions Act, and up to a third of private- 
sector workers were in unions, wages 
and productivity rose in lockstep. You 
can’t even separate them. 
But then in the late seventies when 
we started deregulating airlines and 
deregulating trucking, and when Ron-
ald Reagan became President and bust-
ed the air traffic controllers union, 
PATCO, and the union-busting business 
came up, and union membership start-
ed declining, productivity kept zoom-
ing up, but workers’ compensation was 
totally flat. Since 1979, productivity 
has increased 70 percent, but com-
pensation only 12 percent. 
What about income inequality? We 
can go to the next one. For the last 100 
years, income inequality has tracked 
union membership almost exactly. So 
if you take the share of income taken 
by the top 10 percent of the workforce, 
you can see that as union membership 
grew, income inequality fell. 
Look at the difference the National 
Labor Relations Act itself made. In 
1935, union membership shot up. The 
wages of the top 10 percent shot down 
as a share of everybody. We got more 
equal. 
We 
achieved 
the 
American 
Dream. And now with 1,000 cuts to 
union membership, when we are down 
to 6 percent of private-sector workers 
being in unions, there has been this in-
credible divergence, and the wealthy 
have taken all of the gains, and work-
ers aren’t in unions anymore. 
And let’s look at some specific stuff 
as we get the next slide up here. Let’s 
start with benefits. Union members 
have more benefits and better benefits 
almost across the board. Here are just 
a couple of examples: 86 percent of 
union members have access to paid 
sick leave, as opposed to 72 percent of 
nonunion workers; and 94 percent of 
union 
members 
have 
access 
to 
healthcare benefits, compared to just 
two-thirds of nonunion workers. 
And it is not on this slide, but more 
than half of union members have ac-
cess to defined benefit pensions, real 
pensions, and only a small fraction of 
nonunion workers do. 
Finally, let’s look at wages in the 
next one. For all workers across the 
private sector, union members make 
about $1,150 a week more. 
We are here debating, and finally we 
are passing, $1,400 for poor families one 
time. Union members earn $1,150 more 
every week through their own labor be-
cause they negotiated for it. That is 
$7,800 a year more. 
And finally, if we look at the next 
slide—and Rick is doing an awesome 
job here; I appreciate you—it is espe-
cially important for women and work-
ers of color. Look at this: This shows 
that across all categories of American 
workers, White, Black, and Latinx men 
and 
women 
workers 
make 
more. 
Women make $11,752 a year more if 
they are union members than if they 
are 
not. 
African-American 
workers 
make $10,088 a year more if they are 
union members. And Latinx workers 
make almost $14,000 a year more, 
$13,936. 
Madam Speaker, any way you slice 
it, when we give workers the power to 
form unions at their workplace, they 
lift themselves up, they lift up their 
families, they lift up all the nonunion 
workers around them because the non-
union employers have to raise wages to 
keep up with the unionized workers, 
and they lift up our country. 
Let’s pass the PRO Act and rebuild 
the middle class of this country. 
f 
GUN CONTROL BILLS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. GREENE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition of 
gun control bills. 
I rise today in support of our Second 
Amendment, the greatest freedom that 
we have as Americans, and a right that 
people all over the world wish that 
they had. 
The Second Amendment reads: ‘‘A 
well-regulated militia, being necessary 
to the security of a free state, the right 
of the people to keep and bear arms, 
shall not be infringed.’’ 
H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, both gun control 
bills, infringe on the people’s right to 
keep and bear arms. We must stand up 
and stop the constant flow of gun con-
trol bills that constantly come out of 
this House. The American people have 
these freedoms for a very good purpose. 
You see, the right to defend oneself is 
something that should never require us 
to be on a list. It should never require 
us to pay a tax. It should never require 
us to wait to be able to purchase a fire-
arm to defend ourselves. It should 
never require rules or shame or con-
demnation from another American. 
Right now, we are in a time where 
people are being shamed just for being 
a gun owner. Our government is con-
stantly pursuing legal gun owners and 
making them out to be the bad guy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1128 
March 9, 2021 
Take, for example, in Atlanta, Geor-
gia, my home State, just this past 
weekend at the NBA All-Star game, 
there were 13 shootings. These were all 
illegal shootings. None of those crimi-
nals signed up for a background check 
for their guns. None of those criminals 
considered that they needed a waiting 
period before they used their firearm. 
And none of those criminals cared 
about any of the laws on the books 
when they shot people. 
Criminals don’t care about gun laws. 
Criminals just don’t care. They’re 
going to commit their crime. They are 
going to murder someone, whether 
they have a legal gun, an illegal gun, a 
knife, a hammer, you name it. They 
are criminals. They break the law. 
H.R. 8 requires a background check 
on gun owners. Everyone knows that 
for a background check, you have to 
submit all your information to get that 
background check done. It is actually 
nothing but a national gun registry 
list. And everyone knows that a reg-
istry list leads to gun confiscation 
later on. This is what gun owners 
know. This is what gun owners fear of 
a government that may become too ty-
rannical, which I would like to remind 
you is the whole reason why we have 
the Second Amendment in the first 
place. It is because our brave men and 
women 
who 
founded 
our 
country 
fought against a tyrannical govern-
ment that was coming to take away 
their guns. 
This is not what we want in America. 
We never want a war on our land, but 
we also don’t want a government that 
becomes too controlling and over-
bearing and takes away the rights of 
gun owners. 
b 1030 
You see, gun rights are American 
rights, and gun rights are women’s 
rights. Yesterday was International 
Women’s Day. It is a wonderful thing 
to be an American woman. We are the 
freest women in the world. For us to be 
able to have the right to own a firearm 
and protect ourselves when someone is 
trying to hurt us is a great right. 
Madam Speaker, there is a woman 
named Carol Bowne, who was stabbed 
to death outside of her New Jersey 
home by her ex-boyfriend. Carol knew 
her best chance of defending herself 
from a violent ex-boyfriend was a gun, 
not a piece of paper, not a 911 call. She 
knew her ex-boyfriend was violent and 
wanted to kill her, so she went to buy 
a gun. 
But you know what? It was a back-
ground check, the rules of the State, 
the oppressive gun rules of that State, 
that led to her being stabbed to death 
because it delayed her ability to buy a 
gun and defend herself from an ex-boy-
friend that was out of his mind. 
Carol Bowne had a restraining order. 
She was following the law against her 
boyfriend, so she had a restraining 
order. She had reported him to the po-
lice, but he still came to her house and 
killed her in the driveway. She was 
waiting for her approval of her gun per-

HONORING RAMON ANIBAL RAMOS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the life and 
work of a great New Yorker, a great 
Dominican-American, Ramon Anibal 
Ramos, who was born in San Pedro de 
Macoris in Ingenio Angelina. 
Over 50 years in radio and TV, that is 
what he gave our community. He con-
ducted Fiesta de Tele Antillas on chan-
nel 47. He would listen to rock and roll 
as a young man, at an early age. 
He began La Voz del Tropico in 1958. 
He worked at Radio Radio, Onda Musi-
cal, Radio Reloj. In 1973, he went to 
work for Radio Clarin, ‘‘Entre Carrera 
y Carrera,’’ then Colorvision at a pro-
gram called ‘‘La Alegria del Pais y 
Fiebre del Sabado,’’ and also Super KQ 
FM98. 
He was an advocate for the commu-
nity, and he worked right in the middle 
of the pandemic with SOMOS, a group 
of community-based physicians in the 
community of northern Manhattan. 
Madam Speaker, as the newspaper re-
ported flocks of vultures flying over 
Manhattan in those tough months of 
February, March, April, during the 
pandemic, Ramon Anibal Ramos was 
out there documenting everything that 
was going on in the city of New York 
and reporting on what community doc-
tors at SOMOS were doing on behalf of 
my constituents. He was an advocate 
for the community. He worked with 
those doctors. 
I want to extend my condolences to 
his wife and family, and to say that 
Ramon Anibal Ramos and his show, 
‘‘El Show de Ramon Anibal Ramos,’’ 
was truly ‘‘lo mejor del cable.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I bring his name up 
because we are about to pass a $1.9 tril-
lion rescue package, and I am amazed. 
I am taken aback. I am surprised how 
many in this Chamber and in the Sen-
ate don’t see the importance of this 
rescue package. 
Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, a 
flock of vultures flew over New York 
City. Imagine that, the number of dead 
people, 
families 
mourning, 
people 
fighting for their lives on ventilators 
in hospitals across the city, families 
quarantined, businesses shut down. 
Some of them will not be able to open 
again. Some of them are struggling to 
open right this very moment. 
Imagine the heroes, nurses and doc-
tors and police officers and firefighters, 
community-based physicians, who were 
out there supporting our community, 
putting their lives on the line—includ-
ing Ramon Anibal Ramos, who put his 
life on the line to help New Yorkers. 
Yet, many in this Chamber across 
the aisle and in the Senate don’t see 
the importance of passing this $1.9 tril-
lion package, which provides $75 billion 
for increased vaccination. As we see a 
new variant—by the way, it has been 
determined by researchers that only 
one out of the four antibodies available 
work against this new variant. 
In fact, we are not over this pan-
demic, and we must bring additional 
dollars for vaccination. We must bring 
additional help for small businesses: 
the EIDL Forgiveness Act, additional 
PPP money, $25 billion for restaurants 
that have been hurt; $1,400 for families, 
for individuals, including those chil-
dren and young people who are in 
school and college, and dependent par-
ents who may be living with us. 
Madam Speaker, the other side of the 
aisle and some of our Senators fought 
against the $400 unemployment bene-
fits. They fought over a mere $100. 
What is $100 in today’s cost of living? 
What can you buy with $100? Yet, they 
scrabbled and fought over $100 of unem-
ployment benefits. Incredible. 
Madam Speaker, this is an important 
package that will not only save Amer-
ica; it will put us on the right track to 
recuperate from this horrendous pan-
demic, which may be the crisis of our 
generation. We are here to support that 
package, to open up the schools safer. 
Let’s bring health to the American 
family.

HONORING THE LIFE AND 
MEMORY OF WILLIAM QUARLES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I stand here to honor the life and mem-
ory of William Edward Quarles, Jr. 
Mr. Quarles was a pillar of the 
Goochland County, Virginia, commu-
nity, and he constantly worked to 
make Goochland stronger. He encour-
aged his neighbors to get involved in 
local decisionmaking, and he cared 
about improving public safety and pro-
tecting 
the 
families 
that 
called 
Goochland home. 
William was a dedicated leader with 
a heart for public service. He served on 
the Goochland County Board of Super-
visors for 8 years, serving as chairman 
three times. He served for 6 years on 
the Goochland Planning Commission, 
including two times as chairman. He 
also served on the State EMS Advisory 
Board and as a representative for the

Virginia Association of Counties. In 
these roles, he was skilled at finding 
consensus and preventing divisiveness. 
William was also a fierce champion 
of public education. Throughout his 
life, he fought to make sure that every 
child in the Goochland area could ac-
cess quality education and new oppor-
tunities. He was a cofounder of the 
Goochland Education Foundation, and 
he was serving on the Goochland Coun-
ty School Board at the time of his 
death. 
William took on each day’s new chal-
lenges with an unforgettable vigor, a 
bright smile, and a contagious laugh 
and enthusiasm. He always remained 
positive. His enthusiasm was con-
tagious. 
People 
talked 
about 
how 
you 
couldn’t talk to William without him 
pulling you into some sort of vol-
unteerism, some level of civic engage-
ment, some plan that he was working 
on. He helped people become their bet-
ter selves, their more engaged selves, 
their more community-focused selves. 
Madam Speaker, last month, William 
passed away at the age of 68. He left a 
community mourning. A bright spot, a 
bright man, and a man who would 
bring such kindness to every endeavor, 
William liked to use a simple acronym, 
one that his father-in-law had also 
used. The acronym is SMILE: 
S—Seek to understand before being 
understood; 
M—Make the other person feel im-
portant; 
I—It is not about me; 
L—Listen twice as much as you 
speak; 
E—Enthusiastically 
and 
quickly 
admit it when you are wrong. 
Madam Speaker, when I began run-
ning for Congress, William gave me 
these lessons, this acronym SMILE. He 
said: ‘‘Remember this. This is how you 
best serve people.’’ 
As our Commonwealth and our Na-
tion face new challenges, we would do 
well to follow William’s advice as we 
seek solutions and work to come to-
gether. 
Madam Speaker, today, my thoughts 
are with his wife, Ruth; his sons, Wil-
liam and Christopher; his friends and 
family; and the greater Goochland 
community. William was a friend to 
everyone, and he considered everyone a 
friend.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Gracious God, we pray You draw

good it is to be close to You. 
Come alongside our lawmakers today 
that their walk would fall in step with 
Your own purpose. 
Provide them encouragement when 
their work and their desire for progress 
seems frustrated and hopeless. 
Guide them with Your counsel when 
they find themselves inclined to lead 
on impulse. 
And grant them confidence in Your 
grace plan when they are confounded 
with uncertainty and hesitation. 
Show them the importance of pa-
tience when they face intransigence 
and narrow-mindedness among their 
colleagues. 
And when, on this journey, our 
hearts become embittered, show us how 
to love as You have loved us. 
Sovereign God, despite our best ef-
forts, we may fail today. But You are 
the strength of our hearts and our re-
ward forever. In this promise and in 
Your presence, sustain us in the living 
of these days. 
Amen.

INEQUALITY IS AT HISTORIC 
HIGHS 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the PRO Act. 
Union membership is at historic lows 
while inequality is at historic highs. 
The tremendous income inequality in 
our country is due, in large part, to 
antiunion policies that have stripped 
workers of the freedom to negotiate 
collectively for higher wages, better 
benefits, and safer working conditions. 
Strong unions are essential to re-
building the middle class and improv-
ing the lives of millions of Americans. 
The PRO Act ensures workers have 
the freedom to decide for themselves, 
without retaliation, whether to form a 
union. It strengthens safeguards to en-
sure workers can hold free and fair 
union elections and it imposes pen-
alties on companies and executives 
that violate workers’ collective bar-
gaining rights. 
Passing the PRO Act will not only 
strengthen Rhode Island’s workers’ 
ability to join a union, it will help re-
build the middle class and create an 
economy where everyone can succeed. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
the PRO Act.

RECOGNIZING 
PARRY 
MCCLUER 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
BOYS 
INDOOR 
TRACK AND FIELD TEAM 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to 
recognize 
Parry 
McCluer 
High 
School boys indoor track and field 
team for once again winning the Vir-
ginia Class 1 State championship last 
week. 
This 
victory 
marks 
back-to-back 
State titles for this incredibly talented 
squad led by Coach Poluikis. 
After the Fighting Blues graduated a 
number of their starters last year, 
Poluikis wasn’t sure if his team could 
go the distance. 
With only five Blues competing at 
the State tournament he said: ‘‘I knew 
we could win, but everything had to go 
perfect.’’ And everything did go per-
fectly. 
Trevor Tomlin swept the 1600 and 
3200. Brenden Plogger won the 1000, and 
Zavery Wallace took the shot put. 
Kedryn Chandler contributed points 
with a second-place finish in the 3200 
and a third-place finish in the 1600, 
while Omar Massenberg added points in 
the shot put. 
When all was said and done, Parry 
McCluer had come out with a two-point 
lead over runners-up Altavista. 
This win was made all the more im-
pressive by the fact that all of the 
team’s 58 points were scored in just 
four events. 
Congratulations 
to 
this 
Fighting 
Blues team on a remarkable season. 
You have earned it.

in Nevada and one of the largest in the 
country. 
Our work to train and place thou-
sands of Nevadans in good union jobs 
taught me a lifelong lesson about the 
power of organized labor to uplift 
working people. 
As a founding member and co-chair 
of the Congressional Labor Caucus, I 
am proud to support the PRO Act, 
which will return power to the hands of 
workers instead of Wall Street. 
The PRO Act will ensure that work-
ers have a seat at the table to advocate 
for higher wages, fair benefits, and se-
curity in employment and retirement. 
Passing this legislation will protect 
the right to organize and provide basic 
labor protections to millions of work-
ers who are not currently in a union. 
Passing the PRO Act means undoing 
the damage of the Supreme Court’s 
Janus decision, revitalizing the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board, and re-
balancing the scales between corpora-
tions and working people. 
So I am proud to support the PRO 
Act because I know that when unions 
are strong, America is strong. I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the 
PRO Act.

HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY TO 
GERALDINE AMSTUTZ 
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise to honor Geraldine Amstutz of 
Rochester, Minnesota, who will cele-
brate her 100th birthday on March 15. 
Geraldine was born on March 15, 1921, 
in Grabill, Indiana, a small town found-
ed and named after her grandfather. 
After graduating high school at the 
top of her class, Geraldine went on to 
study music in college. 
In 1943, Geraldine married Tillman 
Amstutz, with whom she would spend 
the next 63 years raising four children 
and eventually settling in Rochester. 
Geraldine has always loved music, es-
pecially playing the piano, but her 
greatest passions involve people and 
art. For decades she has made person-
alized, homemade cards, sending thou-
sands over the years to encourage, lift 
up, honor, and celebrate others. Ap-
proaching 
her 
centennial 
birthday, 
Geraldine continues making cards to 
bless others with her kindness and 
compassion. 
Here is to 100 terrific years, Geral-
dine. 
f 
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL BE 
LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY 
(Ms. KUSTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in strong support of the American 
Rescue Plan Act, ambitious and ur-
gently needed legislation to end the 
COVID–19 epidemic and to facilitate 
our economic recovery. 
The Federal Government has a re-
sponsibility to provide support to mil-
lions of families struggling because of 
lost work or grieving because they lost 
a loved one. 
And this American Rescue Plan ful-
fills this responsibility, providing $1,400 
relief checks to Americans that are 
hurting financially. 
For the Americans who have lost 
their job during the pandemic, the bill 
extends critical unemployment bene-
fits so they can get back on their feet. 
For children and families who are ap-
proaching 1 year of remote schooling, 
this bill provides $125 billion to safely 
reopen our schools and protect teach-
ers and students. 
For small businesses that have been 
hit hard, this legislation could increase 
funding for the Paycheck Protection 
Program and other support loans and 
grants. 
For over 25 million Americans who 
are struggling to put food on the table, 
this bill increases SNAP benefits so 
families do not go hungry. 
For nearly 10 million Americans who 
are behind on rent and utilities, this 
bill provides funds to keep a roof over 
their head and the lights on. 
And I am very pleased that this bill 
includes funding modeled after my leg-
islation to ramp up and fund the manu-
facturing 
and 
distribution 
of 
the 
COVID–19 vaccine.

STUDENTS MUST GET BACK TO 
THE CLASSROOM 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, as the fa-
ther of three school-age boys, the 
health and well-being of children and 
school kids across America is one of 
my top priorities. 
As we continue to navigate the 
COVID pandemic, I have heard repeat-
edly from parents across the 18th Dis-
trict of Illinois about getting our kids 
back in the classroom and back on the 
athletic field. 
Throughout this pandemic, we have 
heard from experts and now President 
Joe Biden about the importance of 
trusting the science. When it comes to 
schools, the science is clear: Students 
and teachers can go back to in-person 
learning safely. The CDC is also clear 
on 
this. 
Risk 
of 
transmission 
of 
COVID–19 in the classroom is ex-
tremely low. 
Getting back in the classroom won’t 
just help our kids achieve their aca-
demic goals, it will also help with their 
mental and physical health, areas that 
many students have struggled with 
during this pandemic. 
Hospitals across the country have 
seen increases in child suicide at-
tempts and mental health admissions. 
Nothing is zero risk, but the con-
sequences of keeping our children out 
of the classroom far outweigh the risk. 
Our kids are suffering mentally and 
academically. The science is clear. 
Let’s put our children first and get stu-
dents back in the classroom as soon as 
possible. 
f 
HELP FOR SAN BERNARDINO 
COUNTY 
(Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the Inland Empire of 
Southern California, the region that 
my family has called home for genera-
tions. 
In my community and around this 
country people are hurting. 
Businesses are struggling to keep 
their doors open. Families are won-
dering where their kids’ next meal is 
going to come from, and our healthcare 
system is being pushed to the brink of 
failure. 
Our communities are hurting, and 
they are wondering if people they sent 
to Washington to represent them are 
going to do anything about it. We need 
relief, and it can’t come soon enough. 
The 
American 
Rescue 
Plan 
rep-
resents real, tangible relief for our 
communities. 
This bill will bring more than $600 
million into my community of San 
Bernardino County to help protect first 
responders, teachers, and other essen-
tial workers. 
It will give small businesses the ac-
cess to funding they need to stay open 
and to put money in people’s pockets 
to help them make ends meet. 
It will help crush the virus by ex-
panding vaccine distribution and ac-
cess. 
And it will give our schools the re-
sources they need to safely reopen and 
put kids in the classroom. 
This is a unique moment in American 
history, and this legislation provides 
bold solutions that this moment calls 
for.

AMERICAN DAIRY FARMERS NEED

(Mr. JACOBS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and

Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
legislation, the Dairy H–2A Eligibility 
Act. 
As I have traveled around my district 
and met with dairy farmers, their num-
ber one need has consistently been a 
reliable workforce. 
Currently, dairy farms do not have 
access to the H–2A visa program be-
cause their work is not considered sea-
sonal. My very simple one-page piece of 
legislation would simply make dairy 
workers eligible for these temporary 
work visas. 
Farming is the largest economic 
driver in my district, and dairy farm-
ing is a critical part of the American 
economy and food supply. 
We need to ensure that farmers have 
the resources and workforce they need

while enforcing our immigration laws 
and preventing illegal immigration. 
This change would put dairy farmers 
on equal footing with other H–2A em-
ployers and adhere to the same rules 
and regulations in force today. 
As larger reforms to the agriculture 
workforce are debated, I ask for the 
consideration of this urgent fix to en-
sure American dairy farmers can con-
tinue to provide for the American fami-
lies and thrive for generations to come.

LABOR IS THE BACKBONE OF THE 
AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act of 
2021. 
The pandemic has made clear that we 
need to strengthen worker rights and 
expand union participation. 
Across this Nation, frontline and es-
sential workers have had to work in 
unsafe conditions with insufficient pay 
because of their inability to negotiate 
with their employers. 
The economic fallout from the pan-
demic has laid bare the costs of severe 
income inequality in America, where 
corporations and the wealthiest indi-
viduals are able to thrive at the ex-
pense of everybody else. 
Labor is the backbone of middle 
America and the key to addressing in-
come inequality. 
Protecting the right to organize and 
to collectively bargain ensures access 
to better wages, more robust benefits, 
and safer working conditions for hard-
working Americans. 
When workers are able to stand to-
gether and demand their fair share, we 
will all be better off. 
I strongly support passage of the 
PRO Act and encourage my colleagues 
to do the same.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, March is Women’s History 
Month, and I am grateful to recognize 
inspirational 
women 
who 
have 
achieved success. 
Inspirational women are the Univer-
sity of South Carolina’s basketball 
team, who won a sixth SEC title in 7 
years, the first time that has been done 
in SEC history. Congratulations to 
these talented women for remaining 
number one. 
This game was also historic because 
it was the first time two Black head 
coaches met in a conference champion-
ship game with Coach Dawn Staley 
leading the Gamecocks and Coach Joni 
Taylor leading Georgia, an important 
milestone in American sports history. 
Best wishes to the Gamecock women 
in the NCAA tournament. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

DELIVERING HELP THROUGH 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support the American Rescue 
Plan. 
Nearly 1 year ago, the first case of 
COVID–19 was confirmed in the district 
that I serve. Now, the virus has in-
fected more than 100,000 people in my 
district. No family in our region, in our 
State, throughout our Nation has been 
left untouched. Our sense of urgency 
could not be stronger. 
The American Rescue Plan is an op-
portunity to deliver help. My corner of 
Illinois has thousands of small busi-
nesses struggling to keep their doors 
open, 113,000 kids who have yet to re-
turn to the classroom, and 150 towns in 
the congressional district I serve that 
need help to keep essential services 
running. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill would provide 
an estimated $27 million to Rock Island 
County, 
$55 
million 
to 
Winnebago 
County, $35 million to Peoria County, 
and more than $85 million to the other 
11 counties in between in the congres-
sional district that I serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support and vote for the American Res-
cue Plan.

ACT ON SOUTHERN BORDER 
CRISIS 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, our southern border is in cri-
sis. 
President Biden has been dodging the 
crisis they caused at our southern bor-
der, calling it a challenge, not a crisis. 
They have opened our borders but, at 
the same time, kept our schools closed. 
The Democrat’s approach of ‘‘come 
on in’’ has reversed sensible immigra-
tion control measures put in place by 
the previous administration and led to 
disastrous results. 
Compared to pre-inauguration num-
bers, Customs and Border Protection is 
encountering five times the number of 
family units trying to cross the border. 
We are on pace to have over 100,000 un-
accompanied minors cross the border 
illegally this year, up by 45 percent. 
Customs and Border Protection is pro-
jecting a 20,000-bed shortage for the 
children in their custody. 
Under his rule, asylum seekers are 
now allowed to come into America to 
wait. And even if they are COVID-posi-
tive, they are released into the coun-
try—many of whom will never be seen 
again. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge Presi-
dent Biden to reverse these disastrous 
actions and return to sensible immi-
gration policies that were present to 
stem the tide of illegal immigration. 
f 
PROTECTING RIGHTS TO 
ORGANIZE 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act. 
The PRO Act empowers workers to 
exercise their right to organize and 
holds employers accountable for vio-
lating workers’ rights. 
In my home State of Hawaii, unions 
successfully raised the standard of liv-
ing for thousands of our residents. I am 
proud to say that Hawaii has the high-
est union membership rate in the Na-
tion, at 23.7 percent. 
We must pass the PRO Act to make 
sure all workers have a free and fair 
choice to join a union. 
Mr. Speaker, organized labor has 
opened the doors of opportunity for 
millions of Americans, to help them 
buy homes, secure healthcare, educate 
their children, and enjoy leisure time 
with family and friends. 
Mr. Speaker, as an 11-year card-car-
rying member of the Air Line Pilots 
Association, I know firsthand how 
unions can level the playing field. 
Unions give us a stronger voice to ad-
vocate for higher wages, better bene-
fits, and improved workplace condi-
tions. Unions put the power in the 
hands of the workers. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill will lift up 
American 
workers 
and 
strengthen 
America’s middle class. I urge my col-
leagues to support the PRO Act. 
f 
HONORING GHOST ARMY 
VETERANS 
(Mr. STEWART asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
before you in support of awarding the 
Ghost Army veterans with the Con-
gressional Gold Medal. 
This is such a great story. In World 
War II, the Ghost Army had a mission 
unlike any other. They were recruited 
in one of the greatest counterintel-
ligence operations of our time, fooling 
the Nazis with inflatable tanks, man-
nequins, and decoys. 
It is estimated that they saved tens 
of thousands of American soldiers’ 
lives. 
Their 
work 
was 
so 
groundbreaking that it remained clas-
sified for more than 40 years. 
Mr. Speaker, the Ghost Army and 
their legacy have never been formally 
recognized. This bill is long overdue for 
the soldiers and their families. Of the

1,100 who served, only 11 of them are 
alive today. Among them, 103-year-old 
Staff Sergeant Stanley Nance, who 
lives in my home State of Utah. I have 
had a chance to get to know him. 
He and his fellow soldiers, those few, 
those 11 who are still alive, and their 
families, deserve recognition of their 
service and sacrifices. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues 
to honor the Ghost Army and award 
them the Congressional Gold Medal. 
f 
BRINGING AMERICA BACK TO NOR-
MAL WITH AMERICAN RESCUE 
PLAN 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
highlight 
the 
incredible 
achievements of the American Rescue 
Plan, which will put shots in arms, 
money in pockets, children in schools, 
and people in jobs. 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan will power our efforts to defeat 
this virus and move America forward. 
Significantly, experts agree that the 
American Rescue Plan will cut child 
poverty in half by expanding the child 
tax credit and sending $300 per month 
per child to struggling families on top 
of the $1,400 check that the American 
Rescue Plan will put in the pockets of 
every American. 
The American Rescue Plan will give 
schools the resources they need to safe-
ly reopen and stay open. It will enable 
our businesses to hang on and safely 
cater to their customers while retain-
ing their employees and planning for a 
better future. 
Job one for this new Congress and the 
new administration was always to beat 
back the virus and lift up our Nation. 
The American Rescue Plan takes direct 
aim at COVID–19 and charts the course 
to bring America back to normal.

HONORING REVEREND KEVIN COX 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the leg-
acy of our dear friend, Reverend Kevin 
Cox, as a longtime servant in the min-
istry. 
Reverend Cox started out his journey 
as a CPA, but the Lord brought him 
quickly into the blessings of pastoral 
ministry. From his very first pastorate 
at First Pentecostal Church in a small 
town in Florida in 1980, to now retiring 
after 16 years as Louisiana’s district 
superintendent for the United Pente-
costal Church International, Reverend 
Cox has diligently answered the call of 
God. 
He and his late wife, Delisa, and their 
two sons, who now have beautiful fami-
lies of their own, were never afraid to 
move where the Lord led. 
Psalm 37:23 states that ‘‘the steps of 
a good man are ordered by the Lord: 
and He delighteth in his way.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, well done to Brother 
Cox. The Lord surely delights in his 
way. We are thankful for his years of 
service to the kingdom, and the bless-
ings he has been to countless many 
people, including Louisiana’s Fourth 
Congressional District. God bless him 
in his endeavors throughout retire-
ment. 
f 
ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY FOR 
BLACK WOMEN AND GIRLS 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
on the heels of Black History Month, 
at the beginning of Women’s History 
Month, and 1 year into a pandemic, I 
rise today to bring attention to an ur-
gent task: achieving health equity for 
Black women and girls. 
Over the past year, we have watched 
firsthand as centuries-long systemic 
health and economic disparities have 
translated 
into 
higher 
rates 
of 
coronavirus and fewer resources to 
fight it in Black communities. 
COVID–19 did not create these dis-
parities. It has just made them plain 
for all to see. 
Inequality comes in many forms, but 
health inequalities are among the most 
glaring. As it stands, Black women’s 
life expectancy is nearly 3 years less 
than our White counterparts. 
Recently, the Congressional Caucus 
on Black Women and Girls unveiled our 
first-ever report on this pressing issue 
and others facing Black women and 
girls in our country. More importantly, 
we have laid out solutions to these 
problems. 
It is incumbent upon Congress to 
take on these initiatives because we 
cannot be satisfied until every Amer-
ican, including Black women and girls, 
can lead a long and healthy life. 
Mr. Speaker, to help to accomplish 
these things, we must pass the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MICHAEL MAGLI 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and service of 
my constituent, Deputy Michael Magli 
of the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. 
On February 17, Michael Magli kissed 
his wife and children good-bye for the 
last time as he embarked on what he 
likely believed to be a routine shift. 
Mr. Speaker, sadly, we know now 
that he would not make it back home 
that particular night. He put his life on 
the line to take the hit from a drunk 
driver and save those down the road 
who might have been in the pathway of 
danger. 
As Pinellas County Sheriff Paul 
Gualtieri so movingly put it at his fu-
neral, Michael was at the right place at 
the right time. 
Deputy Magli leaves behind a loving 
wife, two beautiful children, and the 
blue family as they struggle to make 
sense out of unimaginable grief. While 
Michael’s earthly end-of-watch was 
February 17, 2021, his heavenly watch 
will endure forever. 
f 
STANDING WITH WORKERS BY 
PASSING PRO ACT 
(Ms. SEWELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act, the PRO Act. 
Just last weekend, I invited a num-
ber of our Democratic colleagues to 
come to my district and stand in soli-
darity with the Amazon workers in 
Bessemer, Alabama, who are voting 
this month on whether to join the Re-
tail, Wholesale and Department Store 
Union. 
Mr. Speaker, it is because of unions 
that we have a 5-day workweek. It is 
because of unions that we have safer 
working conditions all across America. 
Congress must do more to protect the 
basic right to join a union. 
If we pass the PRO Act, workers in 
Bessemer and workers across 
this 
country will have stronger collective 
bargaining rights and more stream-
lined union election processes. We 
would also have meaningful enforce-
ment for companies that violate work-
ers’ rights. 
The workers in my Alabama district 
deserve a fair election that is free of 
influence from management. 
Mr. Speaker, the Amazon workers in 
Bessemer, Alabama, are following a 
rich tradition of ordinary Alabamians, 
standing up and fighting for civil 
rights and human rights. I am asking 
my colleagues to stand with the work-
ers in Bessemer and around this coun-
try by passing the PRO Act.

RECOGNIZING 
IOWA’S 
STATE 
WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIP WIN-
NERS 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the achieve-
ments of nine young men in my dis-
trict. 
Because schools in Iowa are open for 
in-person learning, our young men and 
women are able to participate in 
sports, and I am able to rise today to 
honor their recent achievements for 
winning Iowa’s State championship in 
wrestling.

of Centerville; Hayden Taylor of Solon; 
Kobe Simon of West Liberty; and 
Marcel Lopez of New London each won 
State championships last month in Des 
Moines. 
Wrestling, we think, in Iowa, we are 
the center of the universe. When it 
comes to wrestling, we are, but we do 
give a nod to a certain Representative 
from Ohio. Wrestling and Dan Gable 
are as much a part of Iowa’s unique 
history and culture as corn, first-in- 
the-Nation caucuses, Casey’s Breakfast 
Pizza, and, of course, CHUCK GRASSLEY. 
Before the pandemic, fans would 
cram into gyms across the State to 
watch our local teams compete. For 
the lucky few who made it to the State 
tournament, thousands would travel 
from all 99 counties to watch. 
These young men and women have 
marked their place in Iowa history, 
and I could not be prouder to represent 
them in Congress. 
f 
PROVIDING IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO 
STRUGGLING AMERICANS 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, a year into 
this pandemic and the world is still 
reeling. It has created a deep economic 
crisis for American families and small 
businesses, 
and 
economic 
disparity 
continues. 
Now that vaccines are being adminis-
tered, with millions inoculated so far, 
hope for gaining the upper hand over 
this disease is on the horizon. 
Last weekend, I saw firsthand the 
smiles on teachers’ faces as they lined 
up for their first dose of the vaccine. 
Desperate to see their students, they 
hold out hope that these shots can get 
them safely back into the classroom 
for the first time in a year. 
Food workers, those who we deem es-
sential to putting food on America’s 
dinner table every night, need to be 
vaccinated as well. I talked to them 
about their desire to do their jobs with-
out fear of getting sick, and getting 
back to a life of normalcy, but we must 
do more to help Americans. 
Our communities are hurting. Fami-
lies, businesses, cities, and States need 
economic relief now. 
This week, we will pass the American 
Rescue Plan to get immediate relief to 
struggling Americans. It provides the 
resources needed to help people get by 
and return to work. This bill will help 
our economy move again, and I am 
proud to support it.

HONORING 
THE 
OUTSTANDING 
WORK OF KELLY BRITTON AND 
KATHY CARUSO 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the outstanding work of 
Kelly Britton and Kathy Caruso, two 
residents of New York’s 22nd Congres-
sional District. 
Kelly and Kathy founded and run 
Better Together, an advocacy group for 
children with special needs. As mothers 
with children with disabilities, Kelly 
and 
Kathy 
mobilized 
a 
grassroots 
group of parents and family members 
to advocate for children with differing 
abilities. Today, Better Together is 
bringing awareness to the many unmet 
needs that children with differing abili-
ties experience. 
I recently joined Better Together for 
their first advocacy event, an autism 
awareness and first responder forum. 
This wonderful collaborative event pro-
vided training and guidance to first re-
sponders on how to work effectively 
and compassionately to help patients 
with autism and other disabilities. It 
was a pleasure to join Kelly, Kathy, 
and the Better Together family to dis-
cuss their advocacy efforts and prior-
ities. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Kelly and 
Kathy for giving back to our commu-
nity in such a meaningful way. They 
truly are making the world a better 
place. 
f 
A YEAR AGO THE PANDEMIC 
CHANGED OUR COUNTRY 
(Mr. BROWN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, a year 
ago, this pandemic changed our coun-
try; and during this year, more than 
525,000 Americans have died from the 
virus, including 7,800 Marylanders. Too 
many jobs have been lost, too many 
families are struggling, and too many 
businesses have shuttered. 
The American Rescue Plan provides a 
lifeline for our country. The average 
family of four in my district will re-
ceive approximately $10,000 of direct 
assistance. With another round of stim-
ulus checks and the expansion of the 
child tax credit, we will get families 
back on their feet and cut child pov-
erty in half. 
The American Recuse Plan will also 
aid our communities during this crisis, 
funding that will expand vaccinations, 
especially in Black and Brown commu-
nities; money to help safely open 
schools; and assistance to keep teach-
ers, transit workers, and other public 
servants on the job. 
This unprecedented crisis calls on us 
to meet the moment with decisive ac-
tion. Mr. Speaker, the American Res-
cue Plan is that decisive action.

HONORING MAYOR RAWLEY MCCOY 
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor a 
servant-hearted leader who cared deep-
ly for the Victoria, Texas, community, 
Mayor Rawley McCoy, who passed 
away on March 5, 2021. 
He will be greatly missed by his fam-
ily, friends, and those he represented as 
mayor and those of us who had the 
honor to serve alongside him. A life-
long Victorian, he described our town 
as a wholesome community that pro-
vided an energetic and joyful child-
hood. 
Long before being elected mayor, he 
lived and worked to make our commu-
nity a better place. He was inspired to 
become mayor and to make Victoria, 
as he said, the kind of place where fu-
ture generations can live their Amer-
ican dream. I will miss working with 
him, as I appreciated his heart to work 
with and to collaborate in order to 
serve people. 
Mr. Speaker, Rawley once said, ‘‘We 
can never become a great city until all 
of us can sit at and are welcome at the 
table.’’ 
My prayers are with him, his wife, 
their three children, and all who had 
the great pleasure of knowing Mayor 
Rawley McCoy.

AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
APPLIED

(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
The University’s Safety, Health, and 
Environmental Applied Sciences pro-
gram recently received a national rec-
ognition. Universities.com ranked the 
program third in the Nation, giving 
IUP’s program top marks in career 
preparation, students and culture, fa-
cilities, activities, and groups. More 
than 8,000 colleges and universities 
were considered in this ranking proc-
ess. 
Believed to be one of the first pro-
grams of its kind in the Nation, IUP’s 
Safety, Health, and Environmental Ap-
plied Sciences program trains safety 
professionals in industry, government, 
and institutional settings. According 
to 
the 
department’s 
chairwoman, 
Tracy Cekada, the program prepares 
students for work in a wide range of 
areas, including manufacturing, oil and 
gas, insurance, healthcare, construc-
tion, distribution, government, trans-
portation, and the service industry. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have such 
a stellar academic institution in my 
district like Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania, and this top-notch pro-
gram comes as no surprise. 
Congratulations, IUP, for this well- 
deserved recognition.

ation. Whenever such a request is received, it 
shall be the duty of the Service promptly to put 
itself in communication with the parties and to 
use its best efforts, by mediation and concilia-
tion, to bring them to agreement. 
‘‘(C) If after the expiration of the 30-day pe-
riod beginning on the date on which the request 
for mediation is made under subparagraph (B), 
or such additional period as the parties may 
agree upon, the Service is not able to bring the 
parties to agreement by conciliation, the Service 
shall refer the dispute to a tripartite arbitration 
panel established in accordance with such regu-
lations as may be prescribed by the Service, with 
one member selected by the labor organization, 
one member selected by the employer, and one 
neutral member mutually agreed to by the par-
ties. The labor organization and employer must 
each select the members of the tripartite arbitra-
tion panel within 14 days of the Service’s refer-
ral; if the labor organization or employer fail to 
do so, the Service shall designate any members 
not selected by the labor organization or the em-
ployer. A majority of the tripartite arbitration 
panel shall render a decision settling the dispute 
and such decision shall be binding upon the 
parties for a period of 2 years, unless amended 
during such period by written consent of the 
parties. Such decision shall be based on— 
‘‘(i) the employer’s financial status and pros-
pects; 
‘‘(ii) the size and type of the employer’s oper-
ations and business; 
‘‘(iii) the employees’ cost of living; 
‘‘(iv) the employees’ ability to sustain them-
selves, their families, and their dependents on 
the wages and benefits they earn from the em-
ployer; and

lows: 
‘‘(e) Notwithstanding chapter 1 of title 9, 
United States Code (commonly known as the 
‘Federal Arbitration Act’), or any other provi-
sion of law, it shall be an unfair labor practice 
under subsection (a)(1) for any employer— 
‘‘(1) to enter into or attempt to enforce any 
agreement, express or implied, whereby prior to 
a dispute to which the agreement applies, an 
employee undertakes or promises not to pursue, 
bring, join, litigate, or support any kind of 
joint, class, or collective claim arising from or 
relating to the employment of such employee in 
any forum that, but for such agreement, is of 
competent jurisdiction; 
‘‘(2) to coerce an employee into undertaking 
or promising not to pursue, bring, join, litigate, 
or support any kind of joint, class, or collective 
claim arising from or relating to the employment 
of such employee; or 
‘‘(3) to retaliate or threaten to retaliate 
against an employee for refusing to undertake 
or promise not to pursue, bring, join, litigate, or 
support any kind of joint, class, or collective 
claim arising from or relating to the employment 
of such employee: Provided, That any agree-
ment that violates this subsection or results from 
a violation of this subsection shall be to such ex-
tent unenforceable and void: Provided further, 
That this subsection shall not apply to any 
agreement embodied in or expressly permitted by 
a contract between an employer and a labor or-
ganization.’’; 
(6) in subsection (g), by striking ‘‘clause (B) of 
the last sentence of section 8(d) of this Act’’ and 
inserting ‘‘subsection (d)(2)(B)’’; and 
(7) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(h)(1) The Board shall promulgate regula-
tions requiring each employer to post and main-
tain, in conspicuous places where notices to em-
ployees and applicants for employment are cus-
tomarily posted both physically and electroni-
cally, a notice setting forth the rights and pro-
tections afforded employees under this Act. The 
Board shall make available to the public the 
form and text of such notice. The Board shall 
promulgate regulations requiring employers to 
notify each new employee of the information 
contained in the notice described in the pre-
ceding two sentences. 
‘‘(2) Whenever the Board directs an election 
under section 9(c) or approves an election agree-
ment, the employer of employees in the bar-
gaining unit shall, not later than 2 business 
days after the Board directs such election or ap-
proves such election agreement, provide a voter 
list to a labor organization that has petitioned 
to represent such employees. Such voter list 
shall include the names of all employees in the 
bargaining unit and such employees’ home ad-
dresses, work locations, shifts, job classifica-
tions, and, if available to the employer, personal 
landline and mobile telephone numbers, and 
work and personal email addresses; the voter list 
must be provided in a searchable electronic for-
mat generally approved by the Board unless the 
employer certifies that the employer does not 
possess the capacity to produce the list in the 
required form. Not later than 9 months after the 
date of enactment of the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act of 2021, the Board shall promul-
gate regulations implementing the requirements 
of this paragraph. 
‘‘(i) The rights of an employee under section 7 
include the right to use electronic communica-

laptops, tablets, internet access, email, cellular 
telephones, or other company equipment) of the 
employer of such employee to engage in activi-
ties protected under section 7 if such employer 
has given such employee access to such devices 
and systems in the course of the work of such 
employee, absent a compelling business ration-
ale for denying or limiting such use.’’. 
SEC. 105. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. 
Section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act 
(29 U.S.C. 159) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (c)— 
(A) by amending paragraph (1) to read as fol-
lows: 
‘‘(1) Whenever a petition shall have been 
filed, in accordance with such regulations as 
may be prescribed by the Board, by an employee 
or group of employees or any individual or labor 
organization acting in their behalf alleging that 
a substantial number of employees (i) wish to be 
represented for collective bargaining and that 
their employer declines to recognize their rep-
resentative as the representative defined in sec-
tion 9(a), or (ii) assert that the individual or 
labor organization, which has been certified or 
is being recognized by their employer as the bar-
gaining representative, is no longer a represent-
ative as defined in section 9(a), the Board shall 
investigate such petition and if it has reason-
able cause to believe that a question of represen-
tation affecting commerce exists shall provide 
for an appropriate hearing upon due notice. 
Such hearing may be conducted by an officer or 
employee of the regional office, who shall not 
make any recommendations with respect there-
to. If the Board finds upon the record of such 
hearing that such a question of representation 
exists, it shall direct an election by secret ballot 
and shall certify the results thereof. The Board 
shall find the labor organization’s proposed unit 
to be appropriate if the employees in the pro-
posed unit share a community of interest, and if 
the employees outside the unit do not share an 
overwhelming community of interest with em-
ployees inside. At the request of the labor orga-
nization, the Board shall direct that the election 
be conducted through certified mail, electroni-
cally, at the work location, or at a location 
other than one owned or controlled by the em-
ployer. No employer shall have standing as a 
party or to intervene in any representation pro-
ceeding under this section.’’; 
(B) in paragraph (3), by striking ‘‘an eco-
nomic strike who are not entitled to reinstate-
ment’’ and inserting ‘‘a strike’’; 
(C) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as 
paragraphs (6) and (7), respectively; 
(D) by inserting after paragraph (3) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(4) If the Board finds that, in an election 
under paragraph (1), a majority of the valid 
votes cast in a unit appropriate for purposes of 
collective bargaining have been cast in favor of 
representation by the labor organization, the 
Board shall certify the labor organization as the 
representative of the employees in such unit and 
shall issue an order requiring the employer of 
such employees to collectively bargain with the 
labor organization in accordance with section 
8(d). This order shall be deemed an order under 
section 10(c) of this Act, without need for a de-
termination of an unfair labor practice. 
‘‘(5)(A) If the Board finds that, in an election 
under paragraph (1), a majority of the valid 
votes cast in a unit appropriate for purposes of 
collective bargaining have not been cast in favor 
of representation by the labor organization, the 
Board shall certify the results of the election, 
subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C). 
‘‘(B) In any case in which a majority of the 
valid votes cast in a unit appropriate for pur-
poses of collective bargaining have not been cast 
in favor of representation by the labor organiza-
tion and the Board determines, following a post- 
election hearing, that the employer has com-
mitted a violation of this Act or otherwise inter-
fered with a fair election, and the employer has 
not demonstrated that the violation or other in-
terference is unlikely to have affected the out-
come of the election, the Board shall, without 
ordering a new election, set aside the election 
and certify the labor organization as the rep-
resentative of the employees in such unit and 
issue an order requiring the employer to bargain 
with the labor organization in accordance with 
section 8(d) if, at any time during the period be-
ginning 1 year preceding the date of the com-
mencement of the election and ending on the 
date upon which the Board makes the deter-
mination of a violation or other interference, a 
majority of the employees in the bargaining unit 
have signed authorizations designating the 
labor organization as their collective bargaining 
representative. 
‘‘(C) In any case where the Board determines 
that an election under this paragraph should be 
set aside, the Board shall direct a new election 
with appropriate additional safeguards nec-
essary to ensure a fair election process, except 
in cases where the Board issues a bargaining 
order under subparagraph (B).’’; and 
(E) by inserting after paragraph (7), as so re-
designated, the following: 
‘‘(8) 
Except 
under 
extraordinary 
cir-
cumstances— 
‘‘(A) a pre-election hearing under this sub-
section shall begin not later than 8 days after a 
notice of such hearing is served on the labor or-
ganization and shall continue from day to day 
until completed; 
‘‘(B) a regional director shall transmit the no-
tice of election at the same time as the direction 
of election, and shall transmit such notice and 
such direction electronically (including trans-
mission by email or facsimile) or by overnight 
mail if electronic transmission is unavailable; 
‘‘(C) not later than 2 days after the service of 
the notice of hearing, the employer shall— 
‘‘(i) post the Notice of Petition for Election in 
conspicuous places, including all places where 
notices to employees are customarily posted; 
‘‘(ii) if the employer customarily commu-
nicates with employees electronically, distribute 
such Notice electronically; and 
‘‘(iii) maintain such posting until the petition 
is dismissed or withdrawn or the Notice of Peti-
tion for Election is replaced by the Notice of 
Election; 
‘‘(D) regional directors shall schedule elec-
tions for the earliest date practicable, but not 
later than the 20th business day after the direc-
tion of election; and 
‘‘(E) a post-election hearing under this sub-
section shall begin not later than 14 days after 
the filing of objections, if any.’’;

ganization files an unfair labor practice charge 
alleging a violation of section 8(a) and request-
ing the suspension of a pending petition until 
the unlawful conduct, if any, is remedied or the 
charge is dismissed unless the Board determines 
that employees can, under the circumstances, 
exercise free choice in an election despite the 
unlawful conduct alleged in the charge.’’. 
SEC. 106. DAMAGES FOR UNFAIR LABOR PRAC-
TICES. 
Section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations 
Act (29 U.S.C. 160(c)) is amended by striking 
‘‘suffered by him’’ and inserting ‘‘suffered by 
such employee: Provided further, That if the 
Board finds that an employer has discriminated 
against an employee in violation of paragraph 
(3) or (4) of section 8(a) or has committed a vio-
lation of section 8(a) that results in the dis-
charge of an employee or other serious economic 
harm to an employee, the Board shall award the 
employee back pay without any reduction (in-
cluding any reduction based on the employee’s 
interim earnings or failure to earn interim earn-
ings), front pay (when appropriate), consequen-
tial damages, and an additional amount as liq-
uidated damages equal to two times the amount

(2) by redesignating subsection (d) as sub-
section (e); 
(3) by inserting after subsection (c) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(d)(1) Each order of the Board shall take ef-
fect upon issuance of such order, unless other-
wise directed by the Board, and shall remain in 
effect unless modified by the Board or unless a 
court of competent jurisdiction issues a super-
seding order. 
‘‘(2) Any person who fails or neglects to obey 
an order of the Board shall forfeit and pay to 
the Board a civil penalty of not more than 
$10,000 for each violation, which shall accrue to 
the United States and may be recovered in a 
civil action brought by the Board to the district 
court of the United States in which the unfair 
labor practice or other subject of the order oc-
curred, or in which such person or entity resides 
or transacts business. No action by the Board 
under this paragraph may be made until 30 days 
following the issuance of an order. Each sepa-
rate violation of such an order shall be a sepa-
rate offense, except that, in the case of a viola-
tion in which a person fails to obey or neglects 
to obey a final order of the Board, each day 
such failure or neglect continues shall be 
deemed a separate offense. 
‘‘(3) If, after having provided a person or enti-
ty with notice and an opportunity to be heard 
regarding a civil action under subparagraph (2) 
for the enforcement of an order, the court deter-
mines that the order was regularly made and 
duly served, and that the person or entity is in 
disobedience of the same, the court shall enforce 
obedience to such order by an injunction or 
other proper process, mandatory or otherwise,

or neglect to urge such objection shall be ex-
cused because of extraordinary circumstances. 
The findings of the Board with respect to ques-
tions of fact if supported by substantial evidence 
on the record considered as a whole shall be 
conclusive. If either party shall apply to the 
court for leave to adduce additional evidence 
and shall show to the satisfaction of the court 
that such additional evidence is material and 
that there were reasonable grounds for the fail-
ure to adduce such evidence in the hearing be-
fore the Board, its member, agent, or agency, 
the court may order such additional evidence to 
be taken before the Board, its member, agent, or 
agency, and to be made a part of the record. 
The Board may modify its findings as to the 
facts, or make new findings, by reason of addi-
tional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall 
file such modified or new findings, which find-
ings with respect to questions of fact if sup-
ported by substantial evidence on the record 
considered as a whole shall be conclusive, and 
shall file its recommendations, if any, for the 
modification or setting aside of its original 
order. Upon the filing of the record with it the 
jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and 
its judgment and decree shall be final, except 
that the same shall be subject to review by the 
appropriate United States court of appeals if ap-
plication was made to the district court, and by

significantly interferes with, restrains, or co-
erces employees in the exercise of the rights 
guaranteed under section 7, or involves dis-
charge or other serious economic harm to an em-
ployee, the preliminary investigation of such 
charge shall be made forthwith and given pri-
ority over all other cases except cases of like 
character in the office where it is filed or to 
which it is referred. If, after such investigation, 
the officer or regional attorney to whom the 
matter may be referred has reasonable cause to 
believe such charge is true and that a complaint 
should issue, such officer or attorney shall bring 
a petition for appropriate temporary relief or re-
straining order as set forth in paragraph (1). 
The district court shall grant the relief re-
quested unless the court concludes that there is 
no reasonable likelihood that the Board will 
succeed on the merits of the Board’s claim.’’;

ployer an order requiring that such employer

section 8(a) shall, in addition to any remedy or-
dered by the Board, be subject to a civil penalty

alty, to an amount not to exceed $100,000, in

The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) and the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) will each 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 842, 
the Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act of 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
842, the Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize Act of 2021, or the PRO Act. 
The 
American 
economy 
needs 
a 
strong middle class. Labor unions play 
an essential role in rebuilding our mid-
dle class and improving the lives of 
workers and their families. There is 
clear evidence that workers who orga-
nize a union have higher wages, better 
benefits, and safer workplaces. 
Regrettably, union membership has 
dropped over the last 50 years from 
nearly one-third of all workers in the 
mid-20th century to just over 10 per-
cent of workers today. The decline of 
unions and workers’ bargaining power 
are major reasons why income inequal-
ity has soared and wages have stag-
nated for hardworking people. 
But this decline in union membership 
is not a product of workers’ choices. A 
recent survey by MIT found that near-
ly half of nonunion workers say that 
they would vote to join a union if given 
the opportunity. 
The gap between worker preferences 
and union membership is the result of 
an 85-year-old labor law that lacks the 
teeth to enforce workers’ rights when 
employers unlawfully retaliate against 
them for organizing. The National 
Labor Relations Act, the NLRA, is far 
too weak to defend workers against in-
tensifying antiunion attacks from spe-
cial interests. 
That is why we must pass the PRO 
Act. The legislation strengthens work-
ers’ rights by making significant up-
grades in the NLRA since it was en-
acted 85 years ago. 
First, the PRO Act provides new 
tools 
to 
protect 
workers 
from 
antiunion intimidation and retaliation. 
It then introduces meaningful pen-
alties for companies that violate work-
ers’ rights and closes loopholes they 
use to exploit workers. 
Finally, the PRO Act strengthens 
safeguards to ensure that workers can 
hold free, fair, and safe union elections. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress 
to stand up for workers and ensure that 
they can exercise their right to join to-
gether and negotiate for higher wages, 
better benefits, and a safe workplace. I 
urge my colleagues to support the leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to the radical, partisan, and ut-
terly shameful PRO Act. 
This unnecessary bill is an assault on 
American workers, employers, and the 
economy. Democrats are pushing this 
sweeping legislation without holding a 
single committee hearing or markup. 
Is this the new standard for the peo-
ple’s House? 
It silences the minority and their 
constituents by denying a thorough ex-
amination of yet another extreme and

damaging 
Democrat 
legislative 
scheme. It is disgraceful. 
The pro-union bosses’ act that Demo-
crats have disingenuously titled the 
PRO Act is a left-wing wish list of 
union boss priorities, which under-
mines the rights of workers by forcing 
them to pay into a union system, 
whether or not they want to be rep-
resented by a union. 
Many workers would not choose to 
funnel billions of their hard-earned dol-
lars to left-wing groups like Planned 
Parenthood, the Clinton Foundation, 
the Progressive Democrats of America. 
This misguided bill also stunts eco-
nomic recovery by hitting employers 
over the head with an estimated $47 
billion in new annual costs. But it is 
not just employers who will pay the 
price. This bill will reclassify gig econ-
omy workers as employees, costing 
tens of thousands of workers their jobs 
and eliminating the flexibility so many 
rely on to care for their family mem-
bers; a priority even more critical dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The appalling list of bad policy provi-
sions in this bill goes on, and we will 
hear more about them during this de-
bate. The bottom line is this, the PRO 
Act is a sorry excuse for legislation, 
and the partisan process under which it 
is being considered is equally embar-
rassing. I urge all Members to reject 
the PRO Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), the chair 
of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights 
and Human Services. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has high-
lighted the urgent need for workers to 
have the right to negotiate for better 
wages, stronger benefits, and safer 
working conditions. 
To keep our communities going, 
nurses, grocery store workers, fire-
fighters, childcare workers, educators, 
healthcare workers, and more have 
been showing up to work every day, de-
spite the risks. We have the oppor-
tunity to honor their work and to help 
restore fairness to our economy by 
making it easier for workers to form 
unions and collectively bargain. 
The PRO Act will establish sub-
stantive and enforceable penalties for 
unlawful tactics employers take to 
interfere with workers’ organizing a 
union. The legislation closes loopholes 
in labor laws that allow workers to be 
misclassified, provides them with pro-
tections of the National Labor Rela-
tions Act, bans captive audience meet-
ings, and prohibits employers from 
interfering in union elections. It is the 
most significant workers’ rights legis-
lation in years and an important step 
in restoring the middle class. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the BlueGreen Alliance in 
support of the PRO Act. 
MARCH 8, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: As a coalition of 
some of the nation’s largest labor unions and 
environmental 
organizations, 
collectively 
representing millions of members and sup-
porters, the BlueGreen Alliance and its part-
ners write to express our support for the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 
2021, H.R. 842. 
In the United States, we face a critical 
juncture for the rights of employees to orga-
nize. Workers have faced wage stagnation, 
difficult working conditions, and a wholesale 
effort to decimate their ability to organize 
for the past several decades. Exploitation by 
employers of labor laws that have been made 
toothless has caused union membership to 
fall dramatically from 33 percent in 1956 to 
ten percent in 2018. As it stands, no meaning-
ful penalties exist for corporations using il-
legal tactics to eliminate the option to orga-
nize. Workers, already facing record income 
inequality, now face job losses due to the im-
pacts of the COVID–19 pandemic. And we 
know the reality is that we went into this 
pandemic with three ongoing interconnected 
crises: economic inequality, racial inequal-
ity, and climate change. 
Based on the National Bureau of Economic 
Research’s statistics, we know that unions 
consistently 
provide 
working 
Americans 
with ten to twenty percent higher wages 
than non-unionized workers. Workers who 
are union members fare better in crises— 
whether the crisis is COVID–19 or climate 
change. During crises, unionized workers 
have better access to enhanced safety meas-
ures, unemployment insurance, additional 
pay, paid sick time, and input in the terms 
of furloughs or other job-saving arrange-
ments. Empowering workers, whether they 
are in the private sector or in the public sec-
tor, to band together to negotiate better 
wages and safer working conditions is the 
best path forward to protecting our workers 
and rebuilding America’s middle class. 
Organizing does not just affect job quality, 
though: 
unionized 
workers 
are 
better 
equipped to handle potentially hazardous 
workplace situations, and have more free-
dom to blow the whistle in dangerous situa-
tions. This can avert industrial accidents 
and result in safer communities, as well as 
cleaner air and water. Many unions also take 
firm positions on environmental issues be-
cause they understand the impact that clean 
air and water have on workers. Unions have 
supported the Clean Air Act, the Clean 
Water Act, and other actions designed to 
both reduce the carbon pollution driving cli-
mate change and grow good-paying jobs in 
the clean economy. This bill can also help us 
close the gap in union density and job qual-
ity in our growing clean energy sectors. 
The PRO Act empowers employees by 
strengthening workers’ rights to bargain and 
to organize. It does so by ending prohibitions 
on collective and class-action litigation, pro-
hibiting employers from permanently replac-
ing striking employees, amending how em-
ployees are defined so that no one is 
misclassified as an independent contractor, 
strengthening remedies and enforcement for 
employees who are exercising their rights, 
creating a mediation and arbitration process 
for new unions, protecting against coercive 
captive audience meetings, and streamlining 
the National Labor Relations Board’s proce-
dures. 
The PRO Act would take tangible steps to 
stem the tide of continued violations of the 
rights of working people to organize and 
would provide real consequences for those 
who violate the rights of workers. We must 
restore fairness to our economy so that 
workers no longer get a raw deal, and 
strengthen the right of workers all over the 
country to unionize and bargain for better 
working conditions. For these reasons, we 
urge you to vote yes on the PRO Act. Thank 
you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
BlueGreen Alliance, American Federation 
of Teachers, International Union of Brick-
layers

Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to stand with workers 
and support this bill. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, my Demo-
crat colleagues have, apparently, de-
cided committee work doesn’t matter 
for the 117th Congress because they, 
once again, brought legislation to the 
House floor without first holding a sin-
gle committee hearing or markup. 
b 1245 
As the Republican leader of the 
Health, Employment, Labor, and Pen-
sions Subcommittee, I would have wel-
comed the opportunity to debate and 
amend this flawed legislation in com-
mittee. 
H.R. 842, also known as the PRO Act, 
is a radical proposal aimed at appeas-
ing big union bosses who fund the far 
left’s political agenda. From 2010 to 
2018, unions sent more than $1.6 billion 
in member dues to hundreds of left- 
wing groups like Planned Parenthood, 
the Clinton Foundation, and the Pro-
gressive Democrats of America, instead 
of spending that money on worker rep-
resentation. 
That is right. Union leaders are lin-
ing their pockets and their friends’ 
pockets with the dues workers are 
forced to pay. No worker should be 
forced to participate in union activity 
or pay for representation they do not 
agree with. That is un-American. But 
the pro-union bosses act would over-
turn right-to-work laws in 27 States, 
including my home State of Georgia. 
That would be devastating for Geor-
gia’s post-COVID economy. That is 
why I will offer an amendment pro-
tecting the right-to-work laws. In fact, 
I introduced a total of five amend-
ments to this bill that would put work-
ers first; but, unfortunately, Demo-
crats only allowed one to be considered 
on the House floor for debate even 
though last Congress they allowed 
more than one to be voted on this 
House floor. 
But the American people deserve to 
know the other amendments that the 
Democrats blocked. 
First is protecting employees’ right 
to secret-ballot elections. An amend-
ment requiring all unions to win a se-
cret-ballot election in order to be cer-
tified because no worker should face 
retribution because of how they cast 
their ballot.

standard. An amendment that strikes

the section of the bill which defines 
joint employment using the indirect 
control and replaces this provision 
with the direct and immediate control 
to protect franchisees and treat them 
as any other small business owner. 
Employee 
privacy 
protection. 
An 
amendment requiring employers to re-
ceive express consent from employees 
before sharing their personal informa-
tion with a union because the bill cur-
rently does not require that consent. 
And worker retirement protection. 
This amends the bill to state that man-
datory arbitration agreements cannot 
force the members of a bargaining unit 
into a multiemployer pension plan. 
All of my amendments would bring 
much-needed accountability and trans-
parency, and I am disappointed a ma-
jority of them were not even allowed to 
be offered on the House floor. Further-
more, the PRO Act would further dis-
rupt our economy, which is in des-
perate need of full reopening. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I stand with 
small business owners and our work-
force, and I oppose this bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
during the last Congress we held three 
hearings and considered 35 amend-
ments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN), who is a member of 
the Committee on Education and Labor 
and the co-chair of the new Labor Cau-
cus. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in strong support of the Protecting 
the Right to Organize Act. 
As a small business owner and union 
member of the International Union of 
Painters and Allied Trades for 30 years, 
I know how important it is that every 
worker has a union. 
Giving workers a voice in their work-
place, negotiating for good, family sup-
porting wages and benefits and worker 
safety are crucial to a family’s ability 
to thrive. 
Democrats will deliver on this impor-
tant legislation today, but it is inter-
esting Republicans lately have been 
trying to falsely rebrand themselves as 
the party of working people while op-
posing the strongest bill in Congress to 
give power to workers. The same Re-
publicans who fought tooth and nail to 
reduce stimulus checks and unemploy-
ment 
insurance, 
championed 
union 
busting and prevented an increase in 
the minimum wage from being in-
cluded in COVID relief. 
They claim they are the party of the 
working people. Their idea of helping 
working people is voting for a $2 tril-
lion tax cut for corporate donors and 
billionaire friends but refusing to vote 
for a $1.9 trillion investment in the 
American people. 
Their tax breaks for the top 1 per-
cent, by the way, even included a pro-
vision that might make it easier to 
send jobs overseas. Yes. That is fight-
ing for the average worker—in China. 
Please, if you are the party of work-
ing people, then I am a stunt double, 
doppelganger for Brad Pitt. I hope you 
enjoyed me in ‘‘Fight Club.’’ 
Today, on this side of the aisle we 
proudly stand up to protect the right 
to organize for every worker. 
We will stand up for better worker 
protections in a pandemic. 
We will stand up for negotiating for 
better pay and benefits to support your 
family. 
We will stand up against antiworker 
so-called right-to-work laws that inevi-
tably mean right to work for less. 
We will stand up for gig workers, for 
nurses, 
for 
grocery 
workers, 
for 
meatpackers, for fast-food workers, for 
public service workers, and, yes, for 
Amazon workers in Bessemer, Ala-
bama. 
That is what the party of working 
people would do, and that is why we are 
going to pass the Protecting the Right 
to Organize Act this week. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
two pieces of correspondence from the 
International Brotherhood of Team-
sters and Transport Workers Union of 
America. 
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD 
OF TEAMSTERS, 
Washington, DC, March 5, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 1.4 
million members of the International Broth-
erhood of Teamsters, I am writing to state 
our strong support for H.R. 842, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). 
I urge you to support this critical legislation 
and to oppose any weakening amendments 
and any motion to recommit when H.R. 842 
comes to the House floor this week. The 
Teamsters Union believes that this legisla-
tion is critically important to rebuilding the 
middle class and to begin reversing decades 
of income inequality and the erosion of 
worker rights. 
Today, the economy is not working for 
working people and their families. Wages 
have stagnated for workers across the econ-
omy, while income has skyrocketed for 
CEO’s and the wealthiest one percent. In 
large measure, this inequality is the result 
of a loss of bargaining power and the erosion 
of workers’ ability to exercise their rights on 
the job. 
Today, when workers make the decision to 
stand together and bargain with their em-
ployer for improved working conditions, the 
deck is stacked against them from day one. 
Under current law, unscrupulous employers, 
armed with limitless funds, routinely violate 
the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) 
and block workers’ ability to exercise their 
right to bargain for better wages and better 
working conditions with impunity. The Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act is an im-
portant step forward for workers’ rights, re-
building the middle class, and addressing in-
equality. It would restore and strengthen 
worker protections which have been eroded 
over the years. 
The Protecting the Right to Organize Act 
addresses several major weaknesses in cur-
rent law. The legislation enacts meaningful, 
enforceable penalties on employers who 
break the law and gives workers a private 
right of action if they’ve been terminated for 
union activity. The bill would make elec-
tions fairer by prohibiting employers from 
using coercive activities like ‘‘captive audi-
ence’’ meetings and by preventing employers 
from hiring permanent replacements of 
workers who exercise their right to strike. It 
would establish a process for mediation and 
arbitration to stop stalling tactics at the 
bargaining table and help parties achieve a 
first contract. Importantly, the bill also ad-
dresses 
rampant 
intentional 
misclassification 
and 
ensures 
that 
misclassified workers are not deprived of 
their right to form a union under the NLRA. 
Research shows that workers want unions. 
However, there is a huge gap between the 
share of workers with union representation 
and the share of workers that would like to 
have a union and a voice on the job. The PRO 
Act would take a major step forward in clos-
ing that gap, addressing income inequality, 
and ultimately growing a strong middle 
class. 
I urge you to demonstrate to the American 
people that workers and their rights are a 
priority for this Congress. I hope I can tell 
our members that you stood with them and 
other workers in their efforts to achieve 
meaningful worker rights and protections 
and better wages and working conditions. 
The Teamsters Union urges you to vote yes 
on H.R. 842 and to oppose all efforts to weak-
en this bill by amendment. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. HOFFA, 
General President. 
TRANSPORT WORKERS OF 
AMERICA, AFL-CIO, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of more 
than 150,000 members of the Transport Work-
ers Union (TWU), I am writing to urge you to 
support the Protecting the Right to Organize 
(PRO) Act when it comes to the floor this 
week. This bill directly addresses the needs 
of the middle-class in the 21st century and 
will help ensure that our next generation 
economy is one that puts working families 
first. 
Our labor laws are designed to provide ac-
cess to the time-tested process of collective 
bargaining. Under the National Labor Rela-
tions Act, certain workers, through their 
elected representatives, negotiate with their 
employer over the terms of their labor. How 
often will they work? How much will they be 
paid? What benefits will they receive beyond 
their salary? Through collective bargaining, 
these questions are answered in a unique 
way for each work group and at each com-
pany. This is an incredibly flexible process 
that has allowed TWU to successfully nego-
tiate contracts for everyone from airline me-
chanics to bikeshare workers. 
Bikeshare workers at Motivate (a company 
owned by Lyft) are often considered part of 
the ‘‘gig economy’’. They are also proud 
TWU members with a national contract. For 
many of these union members, the majority 
of their interaction with their employer is 
through an app—very similar to the way 
rideshare drivers interact with their employ-
ers. These workers move around a large geo-
graphic area collecting and repositioning 
bikes in the same way a rideshare driver 
would pick up and move passengers. Unlike 
rideshare drivers, however, bikeshare work-
ers’ rights are not seen as incompatible with 
their company’s business model. 
These workers and many others are proof 
that 
collective 
bargaining 
is 
powerful 
enough to live on into our future. None of 
the more than 200 current contracts that 
TWU has negotiated and implemented is 
identical—in fact many of them would work 
at no other company or among any other 
work group. While the process mandated 
under our labor laws may be the same, the 
outcomes vary wildly, allowing for growth 
and change as circumstances shift and tech-
nologies evolve. All workers deserve access 
to that process in order to better their 
standard of living.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1140 
March 9, 2021 
Unfortunately, the proportion of unionized 
workers in the U.S. is near a 90-year low be-
cause of structural hurdles which make join-
ing a new union very difficult. 
The PRO Act would directly address these 
issues and give workers across the entire 
economy equal access to the collective bar-
gaining process. In order ensure workers’ 
rights keep pace with the new economy, the 
Transport Workers Union strongly urges you 
to vote yes on the PRO Act and to oppose 
any weakening amendments. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN SAMUELSEN, 
International President. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, it is nec-
essary for me to voice my opposition to 
the PRO Act, shortsighted legislation 
that is a bad deal for America’s work-
ers and America’s employers. 
The greatest thing that I learned 
working in a factory is that workers 
care about employers and employers 
care about and value the hardworking 
people who come to work and get the 
job done every day. 
The PRO Act needlessly inserts gov-
ernment—what I call the middleman— 
into the workplace, driving a wedge be-
tween the employee-employer relation-
ship. This bill would infringe on work-
ers’ rights and handcuff employers, 
making it harder for people to make 
decisions that positively impact their 
workforce. 
Our team has met with employers 
and workers across central and north-
eastern Pennsylvania, and the message 
is crystal clear: Say no to the PRO Act. 
Let’s not pretend the government 
knows or cares about workers more 
than the businesses that employ them, 
and let’s not add more mandates where 
they don’t belong. Instead, it is time 
for the government to step back and 
for businesses to continue what they do 
best: innovate, produce, and provide 
opportunities for the American people. 
If my colleagues supporting the PRO 
Act really care about America’s em-
ployers, workers, and boosting our eco-
nomic recovery, then I urge them to 
oppose this special interest giveaway. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL) who is a distinguished mem-
ber of the Committee on Education and 
Labor and is the chair of the Congres-
sional Progressive Caucus. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the PRO Act. 
I am very proud to be a lead sponsor of 
this transformative bill and to rep-
resent one of the most unionized States 
in the country, where I have spent two 
decades organizing alongside unions for 
decent wages, benefits, and workers’ 
rights. 
Unions helped build America’s mid-
dle class. But over the years large cor-
porations have deployed union-busting 
tactics to rob workers of their funda-
mental workplace rights. That changes 
today. 
The PRO Act will undo decades of 
Republican antiworker policies. It puts 
power back into the hands of workers 
and secures the right to organize and 
bargain for good wages, fair benefits, 
and an equal voice on the job. The PRO 
Act is about democracy in the work-
place. It is about standing with the he-
roic workers carrying America through 
the pandemic. 
It is past time to pass the PRO Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
two letters of support from the Service 
Employees International Union and the 
Communications Workers of America. 
SEIU, 
February 4, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 2 
million members of the Service Employees 
International Union (SEIU), we write to en-
dorse the Protecting the Right to Organize 
(PRO) Act of 2021. This important bill would 
strengthen working Americans’ rights to 
join together in unions and bargain for high-
er wages and better working conditions to 
help create balanced, inclusive growth, and 
build our economy back better than it was 
before. 
We are nearly one year into the worst pub-
lic health and economic crisis we have faced 
in a generation, with underpaid frontline 
workers literally risking their lives for pov-
erty wages. While many have rightly called 
these essential workers heroes, our country 
has failed to truly respect them with a prom-
ise to protect them and adequately pay them 
throughout the crisis. Too many essential 
workers continue to lack basic work protec-
tions like proper PPE, paid sick and family 
leave, or health care, and far too few have a 
voice in the workplace and access to a union. 
This is most true for the Black and brown 
workers who have kept us safe and fed 
throughout this crisis. 
Unions are the best solution to leveling the 
playing field and safeguarding the health and 
safety of working people. In fact, during this 
crisis, where workers that have been able to 
act collectively and through their union, 
they have been able to secure enhanced safe-
ty measures, additional hazard pay, paid sick 
time, and other protections. But because of a 
concerted effort to undermine unions in 
America over the past forty years, just 10% 
of working people have a say in the decisions 
that affect them at work, in their commu-
nities and in our economy. Too many un-
scrupulous employers—even amidst a pan-
demic—take advantage of America’s out-
dated labor laws to stifle the ability of work-
ing people to join together in unions to stay 
safe on the job and build a better future for 
their families. 
The PRO Act would reinvigorate labor law 
to help build an economy that works better 
for the millions of people who work for a liv-
ing—not just those at the top. We applaud 
the bill’s joint employer provision, which 
would ensure that workers can meaningfully 
bargain with all companies that actually 
control their employment. We also endorse 
the bill’s new standard to stop employers 
from misclassifying their workers as inde-
pendent contractors or supervisors to escape 
their responsibilities. These changes would 
make it harder for companies to circumvent 
basic worker protections through subcon-
tracting arrangements or other evasions. 
We also strongly support the PRO Act’s re-
forms banning anti-worker state laws that 
supersede collective bargaining agreements. 
These so-called Right-to Work laws weaken 
workers’ voice at the workplace, drive down 
wages, and threaten the economic security of 
all workers—union and nonunion alike. Fur-
thermore, working people subject to these 
laws earn $1,558 less per year than those who 
are not. The PRO Act permits companies and 
workers to decide for themselves whether to 
negotiate fair share agreements in collective 
bargaining. In addition, we are pleased to see 
PRO Act provisions that would deter em-
ployer 
misconduct 
by 
making remedies 
meaningful, penalizing the most egregious 
violations, limiting interference in union 
elections, and facilitating first contracts 
with newly formed unions. The bill right-
fully removes restraints on workers’ soli-
darity actions across different workplaces. 
In this time of crisis, working people 
around the country urgently need the PRO 
Act’s much needed reforms to make it easier 
for people to join unions and hold companies 
accountable. A voice on the job has never 
been more important for safeguarding the 
health, safety, and economic security of the 
working people we have relied on to get us 
through this pandemic. 
SEIU members are proud to support the 
PRO Act. We will add any future votes on 
this legislation to our legislative scorecard. 
Sincerely, 
MARY KAY HENRY, 
International President. 
COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF 
AMERICA, 
AFL-CIO, CLC, 
Washington, DC, March 9, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
members and officers of the Communications 
Workers of America (CWA), I am writing to 
urge you to vote in favor of H.R. 842, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, 
when it comes to a vote on the House floor 
this week. 
The ability of working people to join to-
gether to collectively bargain for fair pay 
and working conditions is a fundamental 
right. But it is extremely difficult for pri-
vate sector workers covered by the NLRA to 
organize if their employer opposes them 
doing so. Companies can intimidate workers 
relentlessly, 
misclassify 
workers, 
gerry-
mander election units, dodge accountability 
for violating worker rights by hiding behind 
subcontractors, and more—all completely le-
gally. And even if they do violate the law 
and illegally terminate or punish workers for 
union activity, the existing NLRA is tooth-
less and its penalties barely amount to a slap 
on the wrist. Companies who illegally fire 
workers are only required to pay them back 
pay, minus any income they’ve had else-
where in the interim. 
Once workers do come together and orga-
nize, the existing NLRA is also inadequate to 
protect worker rights. Companies can easily 
stall indefinitely to prevent workers from 
getting a first contract for years after they 
organize. If and when workers are forced to 
go on strike to protect their livelihoods, em-
ployers can permanently replace strikers 
without consequence. 
The huge surge in economic inequality 
over the past quarter-century is related di-
rectly to many workers’ lack of a strong 
voice on the job. Over that time, wages have 
stagnated for workers across the economy, 
while income has skyrocketed for CEOs and 
the wealthiest 1%. By 2012, the wealthiest 1% 
made 22.5% of national income, while the 
bottom 90% of families made less than half 
of national income—just 49.6%. 
Workers who form unions have stronger 
protections against discrimination and retal-
iation, enhanced job security, better retire-
ment benefits, and more effective ways of 
combating practices that jeopardize their 
health and safety on the job. These problems 
have all been magnified by the ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
New research confirms that workers with-
out union representation are less likely to 
have paid leave, to have access to proper 
PPE at work, or to have protections against

unnecessary layoffs. The PRO Act would fix 
these problems and re-establish workers’ 
right to organize in this country, In doing so, 
it helps combat skyrocketing economic in-
equality and strengthens the middle class. 
Therefore, I strongly urge you to vote in 
favor of the PRO Act and oppose any amend-
ments that would weaken the bill. CWA will 
include votes on this bill in our Congres-
sional Scorecard. 
Thank you in advance for your consider-
ation. 
Sincerely, 
CHRISTOPHER M. SHELTON, 
President, Communications Workers 
of America (CWA). 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition to the 
PRO Act. 
The efforts by House Democrats to 
kill flexible work options in America 
do not consider the harmful effects this 
bill will have on mothers. This bill 
would force workers out of their indi-
vidual labor agreements and into one- 
size-fits-all union contracts. 
I have seven children, and balancing 
work and family is an issue that I truly 
care about. For many mothers, flexible 
work opportunities are their lifeline. 
Federal law should not discourage 
mothers from working in positions 
that fit their unique schedules and 
needs. When given flexible opportuni-
ties, mothers are able to advance their 
careers while balancing competing pri-
orities of childcare, education, caring 
for sick or aging family members, and 
so much more. 
The only thing that this bill is pro on 
is big labor. The PRO Act is a massive 
expansion of union bosses’ power at the 
expense of workers and employers’ 
freedom. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I got here just a little 
before I was going to speak, and I heard 
the gentlewoman from Illinois speak. 
She talked about flexible work hours. I 
thought to myself: Who decides what is 
flexible? 
Historically, of course, working men 
and women were told: You will do this 
for that much at this time under these 
conditions. 
That was the reality—sweatshops, 
health-endangering shops, and long 
hours with little pay. Then the labor 
unions came along. They got some 
strength, they got some support, and lo 
and behold, the middle class started to 
grow and started to make good wages, 
have safe working conditions, and, yes, 
flexible hours. 
Mr. Speaker, as we work to create 
jobs and build our economy back bet-
ter, we need to make sure that the jobs 
that are available to Americans help 
them get by and get ahead. That is 
what the minimum wage battle is 
about. That is what this is about—av-
erage working people wanting to get 
by, wanting to have a decent salary, 
and wanting to have decent working 
conditions. 
Very frankly, that just didn’t hap-
pen, Mr. Speaker. Some died to make 
that a reality. Others were beaten and 
battered in order to have that be a re-
ality. Child labor, abuse of gender, 
women abused in the workplace work-
ing in terrible, odious conditions—that 
is why Democrats passed the PRO Act 
last year, and that is why we will do so 
again today. 
One of the most important tools for 
workers to secure better pay and bene-
fits is the right to organize and bargain 
collectively. Those of you who have 
been employers know that you want to 
maximize profits and you want to try 
and manage and see whether you can 
hire people for X amount of dollars 
rather than X plus Y. That right was 
secured over the course of generations 
by workers who fought to have that 
right recognized and secured. Collec-
tive bargaining made possible the pros-
perity and upward mobility that was a 
hallmark of America in the 20th cen-
tury. 
Strong unions lead to better pay, 
higher quality and more affordable 
healthcare, more secure retirement 
benefits, and workplaces that are safer, 
not just for union members but for all 
workers. 
Unfortunately, in the 21st century, 
Mr. Speaker, the right to organize has 
been eroded and weakened. As a result, 
many workers are stuck with no re-
course to demand the better pay and 
benefits they deserve, and they need, 
and their families need, and we need as 
a middle class society that knows that 
we are a consumer economy. Henry 
Ford knew if you didn’t pay them, then 
they couldn’t buy your cars—a pretty 
simple equation. 
The PRO Act would change that, em-
powering workers, once again, through 
their right to organize. It prevents 
management 
from 
misclassifying 
workers. 
I urge Members to think whether or 
not that happens. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
gig 
economy 
sounds great until you get to be 65 or 67 
and you look around and there is no-
body behind you. There is nobody to 
lift you up. There is nobody to say: 
Thank you for that 30 years, 40 years, 
or 50 years of service to our company 
or to our economy. It prevents manage-
ment from misclassifying workers in 
order to avoid negotiating the fair pay 
and safe working conditions they de-
serve. 
b 1300 
No, they are just contract employees. 
They don’t have any real attachment 
or relationship with our company. 
They are just contract, and we can use 
them one day and throw them away the 
next. 
Moreover, the PRO Act levels the 
playing field for labor unions in con-
tract negotiations. Maybe you don’t 
believe in that, Mr. Speaker, not you 
personally, but maybe there are people 
who don’t believe that they ought to be 
equal. After all, I started the business, 
and I invested money. 
I agree with that; I want to see them 
make money. I am a procapitalist 
Democrat, a procapitalist American. I 
have been around the world, and I have 
seen noncapitalist societies. They don’t 
work very well. But the capitalist soci-
ety works better if everybody is lifted, 
not just some. 
I thank Chairman SCOTT of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee for his 
hard work on this bill, as well as the 
members of his committee. 
I am proud that we Democrats 
strongly support this bill, which is so 
central to our effort to make opportu-
nities more accessible and more broad-
ly available to American workers as we 
look to rebuild our economy stronger 
after COVID–19. 
The leader of the party on the other 
side of the aisle said in his speech that 
he gave at the beginning of the session: 
We are the workers’ party. 
We will see, Mr. Speaker, when we 
vote on this bill, whether that state-
ment was accurate. 
The workers are not against this bill. 
As I said last year, when we passed this 
bill, the PRO Act is the workers’ rights 
legislation that working people in our 
country need and for which they have 
been waiting for far too long. That is 
why we need to pass this bill today and 
send it to the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for 
our workers, for our families, for our 
children, and for our effort to build 
back better and stronger from the chal-
lenges we now face. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the Demo-
crats continue to look backward, 100 
years backward. Just before COVID 
hit, we had the greatest economy in 
our country ever, the lowest unemploy-
ment for women, minorities, everyone, 
without the PRO Act. 
No procapitalist can support this bill. 
This is part of a socialist agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MURPHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in strong opposi-
tion to H.R. 842, the prounion bosses 
act. 
Here we are once again. This is be-
coming all too familiar here in Con-
gress, an exercise for Democrats to 
steamroll these massive bills through 
the House without proper debate or 
transparency. Our committee didn’t 
even have a hearing or a markup on 
this. 
Frankly, the bill is disastrous. Bills 
like this only further suppress workers’ 
rights, create a one-size-fits-all type of 
union contract, and create incentives 
for disruptive and dangerous union 
strikes, especially in healthcare. 
One particularly bothersome practice 
is this legislation would require em-
ployers to hand over workers’ private 
personal information to union orga-
nizers—home 
addresses, 
cell 
phone 
numbers, 
email 
addresses—without

I know leadership doesn’t want you 
guys to do this, but we want to work

sides of the aisle to vote ‘‘no’’ on this 
legislation. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD a letter of sup-
port for the bill from the AFL–CIO. 
Legislative Alert 
AFL-CIO, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On January 26, we 
wrote in support of the Protecting the Right 
to Organize (PRO) Act (H.R. 842), which 
would restore the original intent of the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to give 
working people a voice on the job so they 
can negotiate for higher wages, better bene-
fits, a more secure retirement and a safer 
workplace. We write today to redouble our 
request and to express our views on amend-
ments to H.R. 842 that the Rules Committee 
has made in order. 
Now is the time to pass the PRO Act. For 
too long, employers have been allowed to 
violate workers’ rights with impunity be-
cause the law includes no penalties for doing 
so. As a result, workers’ ability to negotiate 
for better pay and benefits has eroded and in-
come inequality has reached levels we have 
not seen since the Great Depression. In the 
midst of a global pandemic, which has killed 
tens of thousands of front line workers, it is 
more important than ever that working peo-
ple have the right to rely on the protection 
of a union contract. 
The PRO Act will level the playing field to 
give workers a fair shot when fighting for 
improvements on the job. The bill modern-
izes the NLRA by bringing its remedies in 
line with other workplace laws. In addition 
to imposing financial penalties on companies 
and individual corporate officers who violate 
the law, the bill would give workers the op-
tion of bringing their case to federal court. 
The bill would also make union elections 
fairer by prohibiting employers from requir-
ing their employees to attend ‘‘captive audi-
ence’’ meetings, a common tactic whereby 
employers present anti-union propaganda to 
pressure workers to vote against the union. 
Under the bill, once workers vote to form 
a union, the National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB) would be authorized to order that 
the employer commence bargaining a first 
contract. These orders would be enforced in 
district courts to ensure swift justice, avoid-
ing the complex and drawn out process in the 
courts of appeals. In addition, the bill would 
ensure that employees are not deprived of 
our right to a union because an employer de-
liberately misclassifies them as supervisors 
or independent contractors. 
Too often, when workers choose to form a 
union, employers stall the bargaining proc-
ess to avoid reaching an agreement. The 
PRO Act would establish a process for medi-
ation and arbitration to help the parties 
achieve a first contract. This important 
change would make the freedom to negotiate 
a reality for countless workers who form 
unions but never get to enjoy the benefits of 
a collective bargaining agreement due to em-
ployers’ intentional delays. 
The PRO Act recognizes that employees 
need the freedom to picket or withhold our 
labor in order to push for the workplace 
changes we need. The bill protects employ-
ees’ right to strike by preventing employers 
from hiring permanent replacement workers. 
It also allows unrepresented employees to 
engage in collective action or class action 
lawsuits to enforce basic workplace rights, 
rather than being forced to arbitrate such 
claims alone. 
Finally, the bill would eliminate ‘‘right to 
work’’ laws. These laws, steeped in a history 
of racism, are promoted by billionaires and 
special interest groups to give more power to 
corporations at the expense of workers, and 
have the effect of lowering wages and erod-
ing pensions and health care coverage in 
states where they have been adopted. 
The PRO Act is the first step towards re-
storing our middle class by strengthening 
the collective power of workers to negotiate 
for better pay and working conditions. After 
the PRO Act’s passage, we urge Congress to 
further empower workers through passage of 
the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate 
Act, so our nation’s public sector workers 
may enjoy the protections of a union con-
tract. 
We urge you to support and vote for the 
PRO Act. 
AMENDMENT RECOMMENDATIONS 
Tlaib (#8) This amendment establishes a 
120–day timeline for the tripartite arbitra-
tion process between the employees/labor or-
ganization and employer to ensure that the 
arbitration process is not indefinitely drawn 
out. Vote yes. 
Hern (#6) Prohibits the PRO Act from tak-
ing effect until the Secretary of Labor cer-
tifies that the PRO Act will not negatively 
affect employment rates. There is nothing to 
support the notion that strong labor protec-
tions have adverse impacts on job numbers. 
This serves no purpose other than to further 
delay worker access to the protections of the 
PRO Act. Vote no. 
Keller (#16) This amendment deletes the 
provisions of the bill prohibiting employers 
from permanently replacing workers on 
strike and protecting the rights of workers 
to engage in brief or intermittent strikes. 
Vote no. 
Good (#18) Amends section 302 of the Labor 
Management Relations Act to prohibit em-
ployers from remaining neutral during an or-
ganizing effort or election. Vote no. 
Comer (#21) This amendment strikes the 
provision of the bill which requires employ-
ers to disclose how much they are spending 
on union-busting or ‘‘union avoidance’’ con-
sultants. Vote no. 
Torres (#22) This amendment revises the 
Labor-Management and Disclosure Act of 
1959 to require the Department of Labor to 
make disclosures under the persuader rule 
publicly available in an accessible and 
searchable electronic form, and through a se-
cure software application for use on an elec-
tronic device. Vote yes. 
Walberg (#24) This amendment seeks to ex-
tend the time between a petition for a union 
election and a pre-election hearing. Vote no. 
Levin (#34) This amendment directs the 
NLRB to develop a system and procedures to 
conduct union representation elections elec-
tronically, as allowed by the PRO Act itself. 
Vote yes. 
Fulcher (#37) Codifies a vote-and-impound 
process through which the NLRB will con-
duct union elections even where employer 
coercion or other unfair labor practices have 
occurred, tainting the election. This policy 
is harmful to workers who are subject to em-
ployer unfair labor practices during or prior 
to a union election. Vote no. 
Fitzgerald (#39) Requires an unnecessary 
administrative process for unions to collect 
consent before using dues for activities other 
than collective bargaining or contract ad-
ministration. Serves only to create adminis-
trative hurdles as employees are already en-
titled to limit payments to union to those 
for representational purposes. Vote no. 
Allen (#47) This amendment strikes the 
provision requiring states to allow ‘‘fair 
share agreements.’’ So-called ‘‘Right to 
Work’’ laws, which prohibit fair share agree-
ments, depress wages and benefits. Vote no. 
McBath (#54) This amendment simply 
clarifies that the definition of employer and 
employee in the PRO Act does not affect 
state laws governing wages, hours, workers’ 
compensation or unemployment insurance. 
Vote yes. 
Wilson (#59) This amendment strikes the 
provision requiring states to allow ‘‘fair 
share agreements.’’ So-called ‘‘Right to 
Work’’ laws, which prohibit fair share agree-
ments, depress wages and benefits. Vote no. 
Newman (#67) This amendment ensures 
that the NLRB’s notices that inform workers 
of their rights be in the languages spoken by 
the employees. Vote yes. 
The AFL-CIO offers no recommendation on 
the following amendments: Jackson Lee 
(#12), Bordeaux (#25), Stevens (#65), Murphy 
(#68), Davids (#71). 
Restoring our middle class depends on 
strengthening the collective power of work-
ers to negotiate for better pay and working 
conditions. This is why public support for 
unions is the highest it has been in decades. 
We urge you to support the PRO Act, oppose 
all weakening amendments for the reasons 
explained above, and help us build an econ-
omy that works for all working families. We 
also urge you to oppose any Motion to Re-
commit, which would have the effect of kill-
ing the bill. 
Sincerely, 
WILLIAM SAMUEL, 
Director, Government Affairs. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I wish I had time to rebut many argu-
ments, like the one we just heard. The 
requirement that the employer share 
lists of the employees during a union 
election is decades and decades old. It 
hasn’t changed. 
In any event, I am here to support 
the PRO Act with all of my heart. For 
decades, we have witnessed the loss of 
workers’ rights, the decline of private- 
sector union membership, and the ero-
sion of the American middle class. For 
86 years, Congress has failed to pass 
any meaningful private-sector labor 
law reform to reverse these devastating 
trends. 
The decline of union membership has 
resulted in an unequal economy where 
workers no longer receive a fair share 
of the profits they produce. But we can 
change that starting today. 
The 
PRO 
Act 
protects 
workers’ 
rights to unite and negotiate for higher 
pay, better benefits, and safer working 
conditions. By passing the PRO Act, we 
empower workers to fight for the fruits 
of their labor and build an economy 
that works for all Americans. 
I urge all of my colleagues to stand 
up for the working people of this Na-
tion and vote for the PRO Act. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 842. 
This bill would be the most drastic 
change to labor law this country has 
seen in the past 80 years. It would se-
verely upend labor laws and change

long-established precedents at the be-
hest of Democrats and their Big Labor 
donors and at the expense of hard-
working Americans. 
This bill would take away the flexi-
bility of workers to choose their own 
work hours, place onerous burdens on 
small business, restrict the ability of 
employers to seek labor relations ad-
vice, and violate workers’ privacy by 
giving labor organizations access to 
their contact information without con-
sent. 
This bill would also undermine the 
ability of States to choose their own 
labor laws by striking down the right- 
to-work laws of 27 States. 
As a member of the Wisconsin Sen-
ate, I authored the right-to-work bill 
that became law. I can attest firsthand 
to what the consequences would be if 
these laws were struck down. 
Striking down State right-to-work 
laws would force millions of workers to 
pay dues to labor unions without any 
say about how their money was spent. 
I offered an amendment to this bill 
that would prevent union dues from 
being used for political purposes. It is 
yet to be seen whether Democrats will 
support union bosses or hardworking 
Americans. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
could you advise how much time is 
available on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CICILLINE). The gentleman from Vir-
ginia has 211⁄2
minutes. The gentle-
woman from North Carolina has 201⁄2 
minutes. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. MRVAN), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman SCOTT for this time and op-
portunity to speak in support of H.R. 
842, the Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize Act. 
Unions are the backbone of north-
west Indiana’s economy, and we must 
do all we can to strengthen the ability 
for all workers to form unions. For far 
too long, State and Federal policies 
have targeted union workers and their 
ability to position themselves and le-
verage. 
Today, we change that. Today, we 
have the backs of working families. 
When workers can stand together and 
form a union, they have the ability to 
use their collective voice for fair 
wages, safe working conditions, im-
proved health benefits, and a more se-
cure retirement. 
Organized labor is essential to cre-
ating opportunities for all individuals 
to have a good-paying career where 
they can take care of themselves and 
their families. 
I believe that the divide in our Na-
tion is by workers believing they will 
be left behind. The PRO Act will lift up 
workers and unite workers. 
I thank Chairman SCOTT
for this 
time, and I urge all of my colleagues to 
support the PRO Act so that we can 
move forward in creating an economy 
that works for everyone. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the International Union 
of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers. 
INTERNATIONAL UNION OF BRICKLAYERS 
AND ALLIED CRAFTWORKERS, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
DEAR HOUSE MEMBERS: On behalf of the 
International Union of Bricklayers and Al-
lied Craftworkers (BAC), I am writing to ex-
press our strong support for the Protecting 
the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, H.R. 842. 
The PRO Act is historic legislation that will 
help level the playing field and provide 
workers the opportunity to freely exercise 
their right to organize a union. President 
Biden captured this fundamental principle 
clearly and succinctly when he told Amer-
ica’s workers and companies that ‘‘The 
choice to join a union is up to the workers— 
full stop.’’ 
BAC is proud of the relationship that we 
share with our signatory employers across 
the United States to provide vital building 
and construction services to the commu-
nities we live in. However, our members, and 
just as importantly the contractors that hire 
them, are under assault by unscrupulous cor-
porations and employers that abuse and deny 
their workers from having a meaningful 
voice in the workplace. The PRO Act would 
help address these abuses and provide work-
ers a fair shot at forming a union of their 
choice to bargain for better wages, benefits, 
and conditions in the workplace. 
Too often, employers intentionally violate 
the law during organizing campaigns because 
some of the penalties are so weak that low 
road employers just view them as a small 
cost of doing the business of union busting. 
The PRO act strengthens penalties for such 
behavior in order to deter employers from 
interfering with worker’s rights. 
The PRO Act also clarifies the definition of 
independent contractor and supervisor to 
help prevent the misclassification of work-
ers. Misclassification is far too common in 
construction and other industries and it pre-
vents workers from exercising their rights, 
getting the pay and benefits they deserve, 
and deprives communities of much-needed 
revenue through tax evasion. 
Our economy is out of balance and it is 
time for Congress to step up to protect work-
ing class families and restore economic sta-
bility. We urge you to support the PRO Act 
and oppose any weakening amendments 
when the House of Representatives considers 
the bill. 
Sincerely, 
TIMOTHY J. DRISCOLL, 
President. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the PRO Act. 
You see, when I came to Washington, 
D.C., I believed that I had one duty, 
one purpose, that I was elected to serve 
my district, my people, and to answer 
to nobody else except my constituents. 
But since arriving in Congress, I have 
learned that not everyone shares the 
same philosophy. You see, I have come 
to realize that this body is oftentimes 
more interested in self-service than in 
public service, that corporate donors 
come before constituents, and that a 
union boss is more important than an 
American worker. 
The right to work is as intrinsically 
American as the right to vote. No man 
or woman should be denied the fruits of 
his labor simply because they refuse to 
toe a partisan line. Each man and 
woman ought to be granted the dignity 
and respect to decide his own destiny. 
This bill strips the right of self-deter-
mination away from the people and 
places it directly into the hands of the 
powerful. It is a shameful display of 
the very type of self-service that dis-
gusts nearly every American outside of 
Washington, D.C. 
This vote will reveal much about who 
we are elected to serve. Are we, as rep-
resentatives of the people, elected to 
serve union management or our con-
stituents? 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sol-
idarity 
with 
labor 
unions 
that, 
throughout history, have fought the 
greed of their bosses and corporations 
in order to have a better life. 
I rise in solidarity with workers in 
the Marathon Petroleum plant in Min-
nesota who are striking for safer work-
ing conditions and with the workers at 
the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Walk-
er Art Center, and many more work-
places that have recently unionized in 
my district. 
I rise in solidarity with the 5,800 
mostly Black workers in Alabama who 
are currently fighting one of the most 
predatory corporations in the world, 
Amazon, to form a union. 
Labor unions have been the driving 
force for all positive change for work-
ers in modern history. As a former 
union member myself, I can attest to 
the power that workers wield when 
they exercise their right to organize. 
That is why we need the PRO Act and 
why we must pass it this week and 
pressure the Senate to do the same. 
The PRO Act puts power back where 
it belongs, in the hands of workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from National Nurses United. 
NATIONAL NURSES UNITED, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE, The House of Rep-
resentatives is scheduled to vote on H.R. 842, 
the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) 
Act this week. On behalf of the 170,000 nurses 
represented by National Nurses United, the 
largest union of registered nurses in the 
United States, we strongly urge you to vote 
YES on the PRO Act, which would imple-
ment critical improvements to current labor 
law in order to protect the right for workers 
to organize collectively and form a union. 
A union gives workers the ability to act 
together to advocate for safe working condi-
tions, to improve their wages and benefits, 
and 
to 
protect 
their 
workplace 
rights 
through collective bargaining and concerted 
activity. For registered nurses, union advo-
cacy and representation allow us to focus on 
what we do best: caring for our patients. 
Across the country, nurses have been subject 
to intimidation and retaliation from their 
employers 
because 
of 
their 
efforts 
to 
unionize. The PRO Act would provide crit-
ical protections for nurses who want to orga-
nize collectively. 
The dire need for this legislation has been 
made all the more clear during this pan-
demic as nurses have been forced to struggle

together for the most basic safety protec-
tions at their hospitals and clinics. The for-
mation of a union in the hospital not only 
offers protections to nurses and other health 
care workers, but just as importantly, it 
leads to health and safety protections that 
improve patient care. For example, union or-
ganizing has led to improvements in infec-
tious disease protocols, staffing levels, work-
place violence prevention programs, and safe 
patient handling programs, all of which di-
rectly improve patient care. 
Attacks on unions and the right to 
unionize have hurt efforts to protect patient 
care in the hospital, and to improve the lives 
of working families outside the hospital. 
While the latest Gallup poll shows support 
for unions at its highest point since 2003, 
with 65% of Americans approving of labor 
unions, these attacks on unions and the 
right to organize have continued unabated. 
The PRO Act would provide the legislative 
reform needed to protect American workers. 
The PRO Act would have a direct impact 
on registered nurses and all other workers by 
making the following improvements to cur-
rent labor law: 
Prevent employers from interfering in 
union elections, including prohibiting em-
ployers from holding captive audience meet-
ings; 
Facilitate first contracts by requiring me-
diation and arbitration to settle disputes; 
Strengthen support for workers who suffer 
retaliation and require the National Labor 
Relations Board (NLRB) to immediately 
seek an injunction to reinstate employees 
while their cases are pending; 
Prevent employers from forcing employees 
to waive their right to collective or class-ac-
tion litigation; 
Close loopholes in the federal labor law 
that allows employers to deny pay, benefits, 
or workers’ rights to employees; 
Put an end to the misclassification of em-
ployees as supervisors or independent con-
tractors; 
Enhance the right to support boycotts, 
strikes, and other acts of solidarity. 
This legislation is of high priority for reg-
istered nurses across the country, and we 
hope you will join with us in supporting it by 
voting yes. If you have any questions, please 
do not hesitate to contact our Lead Legisla-
tive Advocate.

Nurses 
United.

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Dr. FOXX for yielding time for 
me to speak today. 
Even though I have family members 
who are members of unions, I rise 
today to speak in opposition to H.R. 
842, the PRO Act. 
The PRO Act is an unnecessary chal-
lenge to the rights of business owners 
and workers alike. The legislation 
would eliminate right-to-work laws 
across our country, and Iowa has one of 
those. It is yet another attempt to at-
tack States’ rights. 
Abolishing these laws would force 
workers to participate in and pay dues 
to unions, even if they don’t wish to be 
represented or support a union’s polit-
ical philosophy. 
If my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle cared about workers’ rights, 
why did this administration cancel the 
Keystone Pipeline and open our borders 
to a crisis? 
Additionally, this bill would strike 
down other worker protections, includ-
ing their ability to hold secret ballot 
elections and to be heard by the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board, and 
would create burdensome guidelines for 
determining 
joint 
employment 
and 
independent contractor status. 
We need to do more to support our 
workers and businesses and do it in a 
bipartisan fashion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to oppose the prounion boss 
act. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO), a member of 
the Committee on Education and Labor 
and chair of the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Over the years, Republicans and 
wealthy 
corporate 
interests 
have 
chipped away at labor rights, stripping 
workers of their power and worsening 
economic inequality in the process. 
Since March 2020, as the pandemic 
has ravaged our communities, billion-
aires’ wealth has grown by $1.3 trillion. 
Meanwhile, millions of Americans are 
still unemployed, and working families 
are struggling to pay for food, rent, 
medical bills, and other basic neces-
sities. 
It is time to put an end to antiunion 
activities. They are illegal power grabs 
by antilabor special interests that put 
profits over the needs of working peo-
ple. 
On our path to economic recovery, 
unions will offer us a way to build back 
our middle class stronger than ever be-
fore. Let’s pass this bill to give more 
power to American workers, reduce 
economic 
inequality, 
and 
support 
working families. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the letter from The Leadership Con-
ference on Civil and Human Rights in 
support of the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act of 2021. 
THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE 
ON CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
Vote Yes on H.R. 842, the Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act of 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE, On behalf of The 
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse 
membership of more than 220 national orga-
nizations to promote and protect the civil 
and human rights of all person in the United 
States, we urge you to vote YES on H.R. 842, 
the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) 
Act of 2021. Protecting the right to collec-
tively bargain is a top priority for the civil 
and human rights community, and The Lead-
ership Conference will include your vote on 
H.R. 842 in our Voting Record for the 117th 
Congress. 
Economic security is inextricably linked 
to civil and human rights, and enabling 
working people to exercise the right to form 
unions and engage in meaningful collective 
bargaining is one of the most effective, effi-
cient, and comprehensive ways to promote 
economic security for individuals and their 
families. Unions allow working people to 
have a stronger voice to advocate for fair 
wages, safer working conditions, and better 
workplace standards. A working person cov-
ered by a union contract earns, on average, 
11.2 percent more in wages than a nonunion-
ized worker in the same sector with similar 
education and experience, and the gains are 
even more pronounced for workers of color. 
Black workers, for example, earn 14 percent 
more than their non-union counterparts, and 
Latino workers earn 20 percent more. Unions 
also help close race and gender wage gaps, 
and unionized workers enjoy safer work-
places, stronger health care benefits, more 
predictable work schedules, greater access to 
paid sick days, and better retirement bene-
fits. 
The benefits of unions have become even 
more pronounced during the COVID crisis. 
Too many essential workers during this pan-
demic have lacked basic protections on the 
job, leading to thousands of working people 
becoming infected with the coronavirus, 
some dying as a result. Many sites of 
coronavirus outbreaks during the pandemic 
were at workplaces that offered low-pay and 
limited, if any, benefits to workforces with 
large concentrations of people of color, 
women, and immigrants—communities, who 
because of decades of systemic discrimina-
tion, have fewer resources to withstand a 
health emergency. Working people with a 
union, however, were better able to nego-
tiate enhanced health and safety measures, 
premium pay, and paid sick leave during this 
crisis. Research also shows that unionized 
workers have felt less fearful speaking out 
about health and safety hazards on the job. 
Despite the right to form unions and col-
lectively bargain, attacks on unions have led 
to a decline in the share of working people 
covered by collective bargaining agreements 
over the past 40 years, a trend that has mir-
rored the rise in income inequality in Amer-
ica. It is clear, however, that working people 
want to join unions. There is a 400 percent 
gap between the percentage of working peo-
ple who say they want a union—48 percent— 
and the percentage of unionized workers, 
around 12 percent. Workers want unions be-
cause they have seen how having a collective 
voice allows them to win better pay and ben-
efits, stronger health and safety protections, 
and more fairness on the job. The PRO Act 
would streamline the process for forming a 
union, ensure that new unions are able to ne-
gotiate a first collective bargaining agree-
ment, and hold employers accountable when 
they violate workers’ rights. 
Though the National Labor Relations Act 
(NLRA) was meant to encourage collective 
bargaining, in the 80 years since its passage, 
nearly every amendment to the law has 
made it harder for working people to form 
unions. This allows employers to take advan-
tage of weaknesses in the law to undermine 
the rights of working people, including firing 
pro-union workers, holding mandatory meet-
ings to bash unions, and refusing to bargain 
a first contract after a union is formed. 
These hostile behaviors, which occur at the 
expense of the employee, are often without 
consequence for the employer. The PRO Act 
seeks to remedy this imbalance by bol-
stering workers’ rights and creating ac-
countability for employers that engage in 
anti-union behavior. 
The PRO Act would reform existing labor 
laws and protect the right to join a union by: 
Imposing stronger remedies when employ-
ers interfere with workers’ rights. The PRO

Act would institute civil penalties for viola-
tions of the NLRA and would also require the 
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to 
go to court for an injunction to immediately 
reinstate terminated workers if the NLRB 
believes an employer has illegally retaliated 
against workers for union activity. The PRO 
Act would also give workers the right to go 
to court on their own to seek relief, bringing 
labor law in line with other workplace laws 
that allow for a private right of action. 
Strengthening workers’ right to join a 
union and collectively bargain over working 
conditions. The PRO Act would prohibit em-
ployers from holding mandatory anti-union 
meetings and engaging in other coercive 
anti-union tactics. The law would establish a 
process for reaching a first agreement when 
workers organize, employing mediation, and 
then, if necessary, binding arbitration. The 
PRO Act would also allow employers and 
unions to agree upon a ‘‘fair share’’ clause 
requiring all workers who are covered by the 
collective bargaining agreement to con-
tribute a fair share fee towards the cost of 
bargaining and administering the agree-
ment, even in so-called ‘‘right-to-work’’ 
states. The PRO Act will also help level the 
playing field for workers by repealing the 
prohibition on secondary boycotts and pro-
hibiting employers from firing workers dur-
ing lawful strikes. 
Unrigging the rules that are tilted against 
workers. The PRO Act tightens the defini-
tions of independent contractor and super-
visor to help prevent misclassification and 
make sure that all eligible workers can 
unionize if they choose to do so. The PRO 
Act also makes clear that workers can have 
more than one employer, and that both em-
ployers need to engage in collective bar-
gaining over the terms and conditions of em-
ployment that they control or influence. To 
create transparency in labor-management 
relations, the PRO Act would require em-
ployers to post notices that inform workers 
of their NRLA rights and to disclose con-
tracts with consultants hired to persuade 
workers on how to exercise their rights. 
Through organizing, bargaining, litigation, 
legislative, and political advocacy, unions 
and the labor movement have played a sig-
nificant role in advancing the rights and in-
terests of people of color and women in the 
workplace and in our society overall. Unions 
can best play this role when the right of 
workers to organize and bargain is fully pro-
tected and can be freely exercised. 
Working people in America need—and have 
a right to enjoy—the benefits that result 
from collective bargaining and union mem-
bership. We urge you to vote yes on H.R. 842, 
the Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 
2021, to help ensure that working people are 
paid fairly, treated with dignity, and have a 
voice on the job.

WADE HENDERSON, 
Interim President and

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ten-
nessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER.) 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to the PRO 
Act. 
The bill is nothing more than a pay-
off to union bosses at the expense of 
the American workers and our busi-
nesses. 
This bill would abolish States’ right- 
to-work laws, like ours in Tennessee. 
This would force workers to give 
money to unions from their hard- 
earned paychecks, even if they don’t 
want union representation. 
Where do these union contributions 
end up? 
Well, let me tell you: with left-wing 
political activist groups. $1.6 billion— 
and that is billion, with a B—in union 
member dues went to these groups be-
tween 2010 and 2018 alone. 
Last week, the Democrats passed a 
bill to direct tax dollars to political 
campaigns. And if that wasn’t enough, 
now they are trying to force more 
workers to pay union dues so union 
bosses have more cash to funnel as po-
litical donations to left-wing groups. 
So let me ask you, America: Should 
Members of Congress be able to tell 
others how to do their jobs and who 
can employ you? I think not. 
This bill is just another progressive 
power grab, and American workers and 
businesses deserve better. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on Education and Labor. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the most important pro-labor 
legislation in several generations, the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act, 
otherwise known as the PRO Act. 
For far too long, the deck has been 
stacked against the right to freely or-
ganize and collectively bargain. We 
have seen the result. Despite massive 
gains in productivity and economic 
growth, 
working- 
and 
middle-class 
American workers’ purchasing power 
and real wages have barely moved from 
where they were 40 years ago. Mean-
while, the gains that were created by 
those workers have flowed overwhelm-
ingly to the super wealthy at the very 
top. 
Let’s level the playing field and give 
America’s workers a seat at the table. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the PRO Act, and I urge the Senate to 
pass it and get it to the President’s 
desk for signature. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
make four points on this bill. 
First of all, under this bill, you can 
have a vote on unionization within 
under 15—I am told even 11—days of 
finding out the vote is coming. You 
look at our elections. I know in the 
State of Wisconsin, probably similar, 
you get over 21⁄2 months between filing 
and knowing you are going to have an 
election and actually the election. It is 
hard to believe anybody who really 
cares about the worker would do that. 
Secondly, your privacy concerns. You 
are even giving the addresses of all of 
the employees to the unions. This is 
supposedly the party of women. Do you 
really want to come home at night and 
have people in your driveway wanting 
to talk to you about an election? 
Third, we are getting rid of the secret 
ballot. I don’t know how anybody who 
cares about anybody would get rid of 
the secret ballot. 
And, fourth, you have a situation 
here, when it is unclear whether some-
thing right or wrong happened, auto-
matically you go to a union. So you 
can have a situation here in which the 
majority of people did not vote for a 
union, and the government bureaucrat 
says, automatically, you are unionized. 
And one final comment: For people 
talking about purchasing power, the 
most recent COVID bill is a strange 
bill. Your purchasing power is going 
down. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a letter from the 
International Alliance of Theatrical 
Stage Employees. 
INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OF 
THEATRICAL STAGE EMPLOYEES, 
New York, NY, March 8, 2021. 
Re H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right to Or-
ganize (PRO) Act. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: I write to you on 
behalf of the over 127,000 American members 
of the International Alliance of Theatrical 
Stage Employees (IATSE) to urge you to 
support H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right to 
Organize (PRO) Act, and to oppose any weak-
ening amendments or motion to recommit 
when the U.S. House of Representatives con-
siders the bill this week. 
The IATSE proudly represents behind-the- 
scenes workers in all forms of live theater, 
motion picture and television production, 
trade 
shows 
and 
exhibitions, 
television 
broadcasting, and concerts, as well as the 
equipment and construction shops that sup-
port these areas of the entertainment indus-
try. The ongoing COVID–19 pandemic has put 
millions out of work and threatens the safe-
ty of countless others. Over the course of the 
last year, we have seen that belonging to a 
union can, quite literally, be the difference 
between life and death on the job. The time 
to act is now. 
Labor unions are under assault, with poli-
cies across the country undermining work-
ers’ collective bargaining rights and strip-
ping union workers of the wages, benefits, 
and retirement security they deserve. The 
PRO Act would help level the playing field in 
an economy pillaged by inequality and anti- 
worker legislation and would make the free-
dom to negotiate collectively a reality for 
millions of American workers. 
The PRO Act, which passed the House with 
bipartisan support last year, will restore the 
original intent of the National Labor Rela-
tions Act (NLRA), which was to give work-
ing people a voice on the job so they can ne-
gotiate for higher wages, better benefits, a 
safe workplace and protection against dis-
crimination. 
Among its key provisions, the PRO Act 
gives the National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB) authority to ensure employers not 
only negotiate in good faith but incur finan-
cial and legal penalties for union-busting. 
The status quo gives employers perverse in-
centives to lie, threaten, and coerce workers 
out of joining a union. They routinely fire 
union supporters and force workers to attend 
mandatory 
‘‘captive 
audience 
meetings’’ 
where they slander union membership. 
Too often, when workers choose to form a 
union, employers stall the bargaining proc-
ess to avoid reaching an agreement. The

PRO Act would establish a process for medi-
ation and arbitration to help the parties 
achieve a first contract. Employers would 
also be prohibited from hiding behind sub-
contractors, or deliberately misclassifying 
employees as independent contractors, to 
evade their responsibilities of providing a 
livable wage, health benefits, or safe work 
environment. 
The bill protects the right to strike and 
makes it illegal for bosses to fire and replace 
workers who walk off the job in protest of 
better conditions. Workers must be allowed 
to picket and withhold their labor in order 
to have the power necessary to improve their 
workplaces. 
Finally, this crucial piece of legislation 
eliminates the ‘‘right-to-work’’ laws of the 
Jim Crow era that enable union ‘‘free riders’’ 
and ultimately put lives at risk. Each year, 
dubious special interest groups and their bil-
lionaire funders push these laws to give cor-
porations even greater power at the expense 
of American workers. The last seven decades 
have shown that people in states with right- 
to-work laws receive lower wages and re-
duced access to quality health care and re-
tirement security. 
The passage of the PRO Act is an impor-
tant step to rebuilding America’s working 
class, not just from the policy failures of the 
last few decades, but also the ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic. This crisis has shown 
the importance of having a voice in the 
workplace and support for labor unions is at 
a historic high. Recent studies have found 
that nearly half of all nonunion workers, 
more than 60 million people, would join a 
union today if given the chance. This is that 
chance. That is why I urge you to support 
the PRO Act when it comes before you for a 
vote on the House floor. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide 
input. 
Sincerely, 
MATTHEW D. LOEB, 
International President. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, the 
PRO Act puts workers first. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, al-
most all of the critical sectors of our 
economy that have remained open and 
functioning have relied on union labor 
and union workers. They are our front-
line workers. 
We depend on frontline workers in 
our hospitals, in our transit systems, 
in our classrooms, our schools, in our 
essential businesses, like supermarkets 
and corner stores. Frontline workers 
are, indeed, essential workers. 
Every time you go to any of my 
neighborhoods in Harlem, East Harlem, 
Hamilton 
Heights, 
Washington 
Heights, Inwood, and the northwest 
Bronx, you find these essential work-
ers, 24/7, working to support their fami-
lies and our communities. 
The PRO Act puts workers first with 
the respect and protections and secu-
rity that they deserve. I urge my col-
leagues to support the PRO Act. No 
more lip service. No more empty prom-
ises. Let’s vote for the PRO Act today. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Indi-
ana (Mrs. SPARTZ). 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in opposition to H.R. 842. 
Like many other bills in this Con-
gress, the majority has rushed this bill 
to the floor with no deliberation in 
committee. 
To be clear, I have never opposed 
union rights to organize. In fact, I have 
worked with them on some valid 
issues. However, this bill, among its 
many concerning provisions, denies 
States’ rights. 
As a former State senator, I believe 
it is unconstitutional to deny my State 
of Indiana and our constituents the 
ability to decide for themselves wheth-
er to join a union. 
In 
short, 
the 
PRO 
Act 
is 
an 
antibusiness, antiworker, and antifree 
enterprise socialist agenda. I urge my 
colleagues to vote against this radical 
bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, as we 
gather here today to pass the PRO Act, 
we are engaged in a great act of patri-
otism for our country. 
The middle class is the backbone of 
our democracy. The middle class in 
America has a union label on it. So as 
we move to strengthen collective bar-
gaining and the rest, we are strength-
ening our middle class and our democ-
racy. For that reason, I rise with great 
pride as the House takes this historic 
patriotic step forward for our workers 
and for justice and fairness in America. 
I thank Chairman BOBBY SCOTT, the 
chair of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee, for his leadership in the PRO 
Act, among other things, and his life-
long dedication to fighting for working 
families. 
That is what unifies us as Democrats. 
With all of our differences, our unity 
springs from our commitment to mak-
ing progress for America’s working 
families. 
This progress is possible, because just 
over 4 months ago, Americans went to 
the polls and elected President Biden, a 
champion of workers, whose commit-
ment to families’ health and financial 
security is in his DNA. 
The elected Democratic majorities in 
Congress know that unions are the 
backbone of our Nation. And as I have 
said for many years, the middle class 
has a union label on it. It bears repeat-
ing. 
Now, House Democrats are honoring 
that truth by, tomorrow, passing the 
American Rescue Plan, which honors 
our heroes, healthcare workers, first 
responders, transportation, sanitation, 
food workers, and our teachers, many 
of them members of unions. 
Today, we are passing the crown 
jewel of our pro-worker agenda, the 
PRO Act. 
Again, under the American Rescue 
Plan, we have a very significant provi-
sion for pensions. 
The PRO Act restores and strength-
ens the powers of unions to fight for 
better wages and working conditions, 
which is both a moral and economic 
imperative for building back better— 
building back our economy better. 
Unions pave the way for bigger pay-
checks for all, over the last 80 years, 
consistently providing workers with 10 
to 20 percent higher wages, benefits so 
strong that even nonunion workers re-
ceive better wages. 
Unions deliver greater access to af-
fordable healthcare and a secure retire-
ment. Workers represented by a union 
are significantly more likely to have 
access to health insurance through 
work and five times as likely to have a 
defined benefit pension—and that, with 
Mr. SCOTT’s leadership, is a significant 
part of the American Rescue Plan, 
which we will pass either later today, 
depending on how long it takes in the 
Rules Committee, or tomorrow at the 
latest. 
Vitally, unions are a force for justice. 
Union members of color have almost 
five times the median wealth of their 
nonunion counterparts, and unions are 
one of the most effective tools for clos-
ing the gender pay gap. That is some-
thing I am so proud of and so grateful 
to organized labor for, because they 
have done more to close the gender pay 
gap than any organization you can 
name, except possibly, pretty soon, 
this Congress may vote to have equal 
pay for equal work. That is something 
we have passed in the House; hopefully, 
we can pass it in the Senate. 
Yet today, unions face a brutal and 
existential assault waged from court-
houses, State houses, and even this 
House: from the disastrous Supreme 
Court ruling in Janus, which trampled 
over the freedoms of more than 17 mil-
lion public workers; to so-called right- 
to-work laws, which give employers the 
right to gut unions; to the GOP tax 
scam, giving 83 percent of the benefits 
to corporations and the wealthy and 
raising taxes on 86 million middle-class 
families. 
Let me just say that that GOP tax 
scam, which cost about $1.9 trillion—I 
will talk about this later, but I want to 
mention it here every chance I get. 
Their tax scam cost about $1.9 trillion, 
exactly what this bill invests in, and 
this bill takes half the kids in America 
who are poor, out of poverty, a third of 
the people in poverty out of poverty, 
invests in working-class families, puts 
vaccines in people’s arms, children 
back in school safely, money in peo-
ple’s pockets, and, again, people back 
to work. It is something that will grow 
the economy, as opposed to their tax 
scam, which just heaped mountains of 
debt onto future generations. 
They didn’t complain when it cost 
$1.9 trillion to give a tax break to the 
rich. They are just complaining when 
we are trying to lift the American peo-
ple up in the time of a pandemic, as 
well as the economic crisis that accom-
panies it. 
At the same time of all this, workers 
seeking to organize a union face a 
surge of intimidation and retaliation 
from the employers and special inter-
ests. In fact, employers are charged 
with violating Federal law in the ma-
jority of all union election campaigns 
involving more than 60 employees. In

one out of five union election cam-
paigns, employers are charged with il-
legally firing a worker participating in 
a union activity. Year in and year out, 
big corporate employers get away with 
their crimes. No accountability, no 
consequence; just full impunity. 
We must strengthen the power of 
unions to negotiate for what they need 
and deserve, which is why, today, we 
are passing the PRO Act, because what 
they need and deserve is what Amer-
ica’s workers need and deserve. 
The most comprehensive, consequen-
tial pro-worker legislation in over 80 
years, the PRO Act empowers workers 
to exercise their basic right to orga-
nize, including by giving workers the 
power to override right-to-work laws 
and streamlining access to justice for 
workers who are retaliated against. 
It holds employers accountable, re-
versing an unacceptable status quo in 
which there are no monetary penalties 
for companies that violate workers’ 
rights, no matter how repeated or egre-
gious the violation. 
b 1330 
And it strengthens workers’ access to 
fair and free union elections, fixing a 
process that is fundamentally rigged 
against workers so that they, not em-
ployers, can decide for themselves 
whether to join a union. 
This legislation will make a tremen-
dous difference in workers’ lives, help-
ing combat the acceleration of eco-
nomic inequality that undermines the 
middle class, which has only grown 
worse over the past year. 
In this past year, the rich have got-
ten so much richer. Let me tell you 
how much. During the first 4 months of 
the pandemic, while workers suffered 
record high unemployment, Mr. Speak-
er, American billionaires’ wealth grew 
by $931 billion. Extraction of money to 
the top. 
The PRO Act is part of the Demo-
crats’ mission not only to recover from 
this time of crisis, but to Build Back 
Better, advancing an economy that 
works for every American in every ZIP 
Code. 
As the AFL–CIO, representing over 12 
million workers, writes, ‘‘In the midst 
of a global pandemic, which has killed 
tens of thousands of frontline workers, 
it is more important than ever that 
working people have the right to rely 
on the protection of a union contract. 
The PRO Act will level the playing 
field to give workers a fair shot when 
fighting for improvements on the job 
. . . The PRO Act is the first step to re-
storing our middle class.’’ 
As we pass the PRO Act, Democrats 
will continue our work to pass a $15 
minimum wage, secure paycheck fair-
ness for women—that is coming up in a 
couple of weeks—protect pensions—to-
morrow—and lower healthcare costs 
and increase paychecks for all. 
I have a sweater that one of my 
friends gave me, and it says ‘‘We don’t 
agonize, we organize.’’ So I want to 
also embroider on there, ‘‘We don’t 
agonize, we organize, we unionize,’’ be-
cause that is the way that we are going 
to level the playing field for America’s 
workers. 
For America’s workers and middle 
class and for the financial security of 
all Americans, I urge a strong bipar-
tisan vote on the PRO Act. 
I thank the gentleman again, our dis-
tinguished chair, Mr. SCOTT, for his 
leadership. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, we know 
that hyperbole is the strong suit of 
Democrats, but how anyone can say 
that giving freedom to workers to join 
or not join a union is trampling the 
rights of workers takes hyperbole to 
new heights. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Kentucky 
(Mr. 
COMER). 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
voice my strong opposition to this bill, 
which would cripple American entre-
preneurs and workers, just the opposite 
of what we should be doing to stimu-
late an economy. 
Workers already have the right to or-
ganize under Federal law, as they 
should, but the PRO Act takes the ex-
treme step of forcing unionization onto 
workers who do not wish to be a part of 
a union. 
And just like the recent $2 trillion 
spending spree, Democrats are ram-
ming this partisan bill through with no 
Republican input. We didn’t even have 
a committee hearing to examine its 
harmful effects, including an estimated 
$47 billion on job creators. 
Unfortunately, one of my common-
sense amendments—to preserve a long-
standing ban on secondary boycotts— 
was blocked by the Democrat majority. 
Democrats would be wise to heed 
President Biden’s message of unity and 
work with Republicans to help our 
economy. Instead, they are back this 
week with more partisan bills designed 
to appease left-wing special interest 
groups. American workers deserve bet-
ter. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. BOWMAN), the vice chair 
of the Committee on Education and 
Labor. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, we live 
in a country where CEOs can make as 
much as 320 times what their workers 
make. We live in a country where 1 per-
cent—the top 1 percent economically 
controls more wealth than the bottom 
90 percent of our country. We live in a 
country where three individuals own 
more wealth than the bottom 50 per-
cent of our Nation. In a democracy 
with a Constitution such as ours, this 
economic inequality cannot stand. 
The PRO Act seeks to empower 
workers, workers who built this coun-
try with their blood, sweat, and tears, 
who work overtime and extra time and 
weekends and do not take a vacation so 
that our economy can thrive. The PRO 
Act gives workers the opportunity to 
unionize and organize without being 
oppressed within the plantation capi-
talist system. I rise to ask bipartisan 
support of this important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter of support for this legislation 
from the United Food and Commercial 
Workers International Union.

CONGRESS 
Re 
UFCW 
Action: 
Vote 
YES 
on 
H.R. 
8421 | Protecting the Right to Organize 
(PRO) Act. 
DEAR SENATOR AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE: On 
behalf of the 1.3 million members of the 
United Food and Commercial Workers Inter-
national Union (UFCW), I urge you to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on the Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize Act when it comes to the House floor 
and oppose any motions to reconsider or 
weaking amendments. UFCW members are 
essential frontline workers risking their 
lives to keep food on our tables, grocery 
shelves stocked, and our prescriptions filled 
during this pandemic. By strengthening the 
right to organize, collectively bargain, and 
keep our workplaces safe, the PRO Act will 
provide a better life for our current and fu-
ture members. We will be scoring this vote. 
Workers face many difficulties on the job 
including hazardous working conditions, di-
minishing value of benefits, and stagnating 
wages. The best way for workers to increase 
workplace safety, wages, and benefits is to 
form a union—however, the right to organize 
has been eroded. The PRO Act would mod-
ernize the National Labor Relations Act 
(NLRA) to strengthen the rights of workers 
to organize, place meaningful penalties on 
employers who violate workers’ rights, and 
return power to workers to bargaining for 
fairer wages, benefits, and working condi-
tions. 
The UFCW believes that restoring our mid-
dle class is dependent on strengthening the 
collective strength of workers to negotiate 
for better pay and benefits. Please vote 
‘‘yes’’ on the PRO Act and help us build an 
economy that works for all working families.

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time remains on

ing. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. FULCHER). 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in

privacy, forces independent contractors 
to become employees, and overturns 
right-to-work laws in 27 States, includ-
ing my home State of Idaho. 
The bill obstructs workers from get-
ting rid of corrupt unions by blocking 
or delaying elections from taking place 
due to frivolous lawsuits. 
Now, I have an amendment. It is un-
likely to see the light of day. So I will 
mention it here. It protects the work-
er’s right to vote. Under my amend-
ment, if an unfair labor practice charge

is made, the election still takes place, 
with ballots secured by the National 
Labor Relations Board until the charge 
is resolved. 
Now, make no mistake, H.R. 842 
would still be a bad bill, but at least 
my amendment would ensure union 
elections take place as scheduled, 
prioritizing worker rights over the 
unionization process. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
the gentleman’s amendment was made 
in order, so we will be considering it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ADAMS), the chair of the Workforce 
Protections Subcommittee. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 842, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act. 
Workers, especially people of color, 
built this country, and they have kept 
it afloat. Never has that truth been 
more evident than now, as we grapple 
with the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Despite their essential roles in our 
society, though, we have seen workers’ 
rights systematically suppressed for 
decades, including the fundamental 
right to ban together to organize and 
to advocate for fair treatment, for fair 
pay, and benefits for safe and healthy 
work environments, and for the respect 
and dignity they are due as working 
people, let alone the backbone of our 
economy. 
But, Mr. Speaker and colleagues, 
let’s be clear. This is not just about 
fairness. It is about justice, economic 
justice. Workers, especially women and 
people of color, have driven economic 
growth in this country, but have seen 
the fruit of their labor concentrating 
and accumulating in the hands of the 
wealthiest. In other words, their work, 
their sacrifice has not trickled down. 
Enough is enough. Workers deserve 
their share. They deserve justice. I 
strongly support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the Laborers’ Inter-
national Union of North America. 
LIUNA!, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
500,000 members of the Laborers’ Inter-
national Union of North America (LIUNA), I 
write to ask you to support H.R. 842, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, 
when it comes to the House floor for a vote. 
The right to join a union is critical to ensure 
that workers receive fair pay and benefits 
and safe jobsites. The PRO Act will expand 
the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to 
ensure that workers and unions have real, 
enforceable protections under the law. 
One of the most significant problems with 
the NLRA is the absence of effective rem-
edies for workers against employers who 
break the law. Often, employers fire union 
supporters to defeat union organizing efforts, 
knowing that the penalty is low, only lost 
wages, and even that is reduced by the 
amount the worker earns on any other work 
that he or she finds after getting fired. H.R. 
842 will address this serious problem by au-
thorizing 
the 
National 
Labor 
Relations 
Board (NLRB) to impose penalties of up to 
$50,000 for unfair labor practices. 
The PRO Act strengthens enforcement of 
the NLRA in other important ways. For ex-
ample, the PRO Act allows workers to exer-
cise First Amendment rights to free speech 
against so-called secondary employers. It 
strengthens workers’ and unions’ representa-
tional rights and protects immigrants’ labor 
rights. Significantly, it adopts the so-called 
ABC test for distinguishing employees from 
independent contractors. Under the Bill, a 
person is an independent contractor only if 
the individual is free from the employer’s 
control and direction, the service is outside 
the normal course of the employer’s busi-
ness, and the individual is customarily en-
gaged in an independently established trade 
or business. H.R. 842 will also prevent em-
ployers from misclassifying workers as su-
pervisors and will establish that employers 
with control over employees are held respon-
sible for their actions in the workplace, in-
cluding users of temp agencies. This address-
es an important circumstance, since three 
million people are employed daily by temp 
agencies. The PRO Act would also ban cap-
tive audience meetings, giving workers the 
power and freedom to decide for themselves 
if union representation is right for them. Im-
portantly, the PRO Act would push back on 
the recent so-called right to work laws, 
which harm unions and our members, by al-
lowing unions to recover fair share fees cov-
ering the costs of collective bargaining and 
representation. 
For these reasons, and for the many other 
improvements to labor law in the Bill, 
LIUNA supports the PRO Act and asks you 
to vote yes when it comes to the House floor. 
With kind regards, I am 
Sincerely yours, 
TERRY O’SULLIVAN, 
General President. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. STEEL). 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today against the PRO Act. 
The PRO Act strips people of their 
right to work and comes at a time 
when our economy has been trans-
formed by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Now more than ever, people need more 
flexibility and independence to work in 
the capacity they see fit, not less. 
Independent 
contractors, 
entre-
preneurs, and small businesses in my 
home State of California already un-
derstand the devastating effects AB–5 
had on their ability to provide for their 
families. Even in California, they real-
ized there needed to be exceptions for 
certain industries. The PRO Act makes 
no such exceptions. 
The blanket approach that proved to 
be a disaster in California is certainly 
guaranteed to cause more harm to 
workers at the national level. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this misguided legislation 
and 
to 
preserve 
our 
constituents’ 
rights to work. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JONES), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the PRO Act, which protects 
a worker’s right to join a union. 
This is not just an issue of economic 
justice, as we seek to restore power to 
the people, as we experience an era of 
entrenched corporate power, and as 
members of this very body dare to de-
bate the need for a $15 minimum wage. 
This is also an issue of racial justice. 
History shows that unions help to re-
duce the racial wage gap by empow-
ering Black and Brown workers to 
fight for better pay and better working 
conditions; but, due to Republican poli-
cies, much of that progress has been 
lost. 
Today, we are seeing the increasing 
exploitation 
of 
workers 
of 
color. 
Antiunion policies have hurt Black and 
Brown workers the most. Today, people 
of color are the most likely to be ex-
ploited by greedy corporations. 
We cannot achieve racial justice 
without economic justice, and we can’t 
achieve economic justice without pro-
tecting all of our workers and their 
right to organize. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
proworker bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to H.R. 842, 
the prounion bosses’ act. 
First off, Americans have the right 
to organize and join a union if they 
choose to do so, and United States law 
has protected this freedom for over 80 
years. 
My father was a machinist and a 
union organizer for part of his career, 
and I worked for a time at U.S. Steel 
South Works on the south side of Chi-
cago, a union steelworker. 
Unions have and can still play a valu-
able role in our Nation’s workforce. 
However, any reforms we make to our 
labor laws should put workers first. 
Unfortunately, the radical, partisan 
legislation we are considering today 
grants unprecedented power to union 
leaders at the expense of workers. 
We have seen what can happen when 
union leaders abuse the trust of their 
rank-and-file members. Most recently, 
a Federal investigation into the United 
Autoworkers revealed an extensive and 
long-lasting effort by two former UAW 
presidents and their subordinates to 
embezzle over $1.5 million in UAW 
money for their personal benefit. 
Sadly, the sweeping proposals of this 
bill will only increase the likelihood of 
abuse similar. 
Mr. Speaker, the hardworking fami-
lies we represent deserve better than 
the legislation before us. Let’s elevate 
and protect the rights of workers with 
a union that serves them instead of tip-
ping the scales against them in favor of 
special interests and union leaders who 
serve themselves. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to 
H.R. 842. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
reference was made to union officials 
at the UAW. They were caught and 
prosecuted under present law. The 
Trump administration that prosecuted 
them did not make any recommenda-
tions for changes in the law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1149 
March 9, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ne-
vada (Ms. TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I stand in 
favor of the PRO Act. And what a per-
fect acronym it is, because this bill is, 
indeed, 
proworker, 
procapitalism, 
proeconomic 
recovery, 
profamily, 
prowomen, just pro-American. 
I am proud to represent a State with 
a large union presence, a large orga-
nized labor presence that has over 
161,000 union members, just as I am 
proud to vote for this bill. 
We have seen firsthand how unions 
enable workers to have better pay, bet-
ter benefits, better working conditions. 
Unions also help address the gender 
wage gap and promote diversity. In-
deed, they are the tide that lifts all 
ships; yet, across the country, the right 
to unionize has come under assault. 
In the face of these attacks, the PRO 
Act is the strongest upgrade to work-
ers’ collective bargaining rights in 
nearly a century. 
b 1345 
It will empower workers to exercise 
their rights and hold employers ac-
countable when they try to stand in 
the way. 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
UNITE HERE also in support of the 
PRO Act. 
UNITEHERE!, 
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, 
Las Vegas, NV, March 9, 2021. 
Re Support the PRO Act (H.R. 842). 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: I urge you to sup-
port the Protecting the Right to Organize 
(PRO) Act, H.R. 842. Like President Biden, 
the workers we organize in the casino, hotel, 
and food service industries believe the union 
is the path to the middle class. The PRO Act 
will remove many obstacles to joining a 
union 
and 
achieving 
a 
union 
contract 
through collective bargaining. It will give 
millions of workers a real opportunity to lift 
up themselves and their families into the 
American middle class. 
One of the most significant provisions of 
the PRO Act is to introduce meaningful, en-
forceable penalties for breaking federal labor 
law. President Biden has spoken forcefully 
for the need to hold corporate executives 
personally accountable for interfering in 
union elections and violating other labor 
laws. We should hold corporate decision 
makers personally responsible in order to 
protect employees against illegal anti-union 
actions just as we hold executives respon-
sible in order to protect investors against il-
legal financial reporting practices under the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
In Las Vegas, workers at the Station Casi-
nos chain have fought for over a decade to 
unionize. These workers—cooks, food serv-
ers, bartenders, cocktail servers, porters, 
hotel housekeepers—have seen their efforts 
thwarted every step of the way by Station 
Casinos. The company and its two billionaire 
owners have faced little consequence for the 
company’s long-running anti-union cam-
paign of threats, intimidation, promises, and 
other interference in employees’ efforts to 
exercise their right to join a union as well as 
Trumpian refusals to recognize workers’ 
democratic decisions to unionize without 
costly litigation. The experience of Station 
Casinos workers shows exactly why it is vi-
tally important to pass the PRO Act to pro-
vide for real penalties to corporate and exec-
utive wrongdoing when it comes to worker 
rights. 
In September 2012, the National Labor Re-
lations Board ruled that Station Casinos 
broke the law dozens of times in its initial 
response to worker organizing at its Las 
Vegas casinos. As a remedy, the NLRB re-
quired the company to post a notice at all its 
properties promising not to do so again. 
Given this mere slap on the wrist by the gov-
ernment, it is perhaps unsurprising that Sta-
tion Casinos would continue to use certain of 
the same tactics to oppose unionization that 
it promised it would not engage in. 
Notwithstanding their employer’s opposi-
tion, Station Casinos workers persevered and 
won NLRB-conducted representation elec-
tions at several of the companies’ properties. 
They did so amidst Station Casinos’ ongoing 
anti-union campaign: at Boulder Station, 
67% of workers voted Yes to joining the 
union in September 2016; 78% voted Yes for 
the union at Green Valley Ranch Casino in 
November 2017; 83% voted Yes at Palms Ca-
sino in April 2018; 82% voted Yes at Sunset 
Station in June 2019; 85% voted Yes at Fiesta 
Rancho Casino in June 2019; and 57% voted 
Yes at Fiesta Henderson Casino in Sep-
tember 2019. 
But these election victories have not led to 
bargaining victories. Station Casinos refused 
to accept the results of several of these land-
slide results. Instead it mounted a time-con-
suming litigation campaign through the 
NLRB and, in two instances, the courts, 
seeking to overturn workers’ democratic 
choices. It did so despite public statements 
that it would respect the results of NLRB 
elections. 
Even after Station Casinos stopped liti-
gating election results and started to nego-
tiate with the union, it has made massive 
unilateral changes in what the Union alleges 
is an effort to frustrate the possibility of 
reaching collective bargaining agreements. 
While the Union expects that the NLRB’s 
Acting General Counsel’s office will do ev-
erything in his power to address these al-
leged unfair labor practices, he still has no 
better remedies available to him than when 
Station 
Casinos 
was 
first 
cited 
with 
lawbreaking in 2012. 
Years of facing no real consequences cul-
minated in a frenzied campaign by Station 
Casinos to stop workers at its largest prop-
erty, Red Rock Resort, from voting for the 
union in December 2019. The company’s ac-
tion was so brazen and egregious that the 
NLRB is currently seeking a rare federal 
court injunction against it. But it should not 
have gotten to this point for there to be po-
tentially real consequences for a company 
that repeatedly breaks federal labor law. Re-
cidivism should have consequences. 
Station Casinos has been able to attack its 
employee’s federal rights to organize and 
collectively bargain for years with impunity 
because the company and its decision mak-
ers—ultimately its billionaire owners—have 
not had to pay, literally and figuratively, for 
management’s breaking the law, denying 
workers’ right to organize, and refusing to 
recognize 
the 
democratic 
decision 
to 
unionize. 
The PRO Act would begin to change this 
unfair situation by putting real teeth into 
the National Labor Relations Act, including 
permitting the NLRB to impose personal li-
ability on corporate directors and officers 
who participate in violations of workers’ 
rights or have knowledge of and fail to pre-
vent such violations. This and other changes 
are necessary to change the anti-union be-
havior of those who are insulated from the 
consequences of lawbreaking by their enor-
mous amount of legal and other resources at 
their disposal. 
Real monetary penalties and personal li-
ability—including jail time, as President 
Biden has argued—are what will make cor-
porate decision makers understand that it is 
the national policy of the United States, en-
shrined in the National Labor Relations Act, 
to encourage unionization and collective 
bargaining. With the PRO Act, we can begin 
to modernize our legal system to advance 
American workers’ rights to organize and 
collectively bargain in accordance with that 
national policy. 
I urge you to vote Yes on the PRO Act. 
Sincerely, 
D. TAYLOR, 
President. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
unions make American companies less 
efficient, less profitable, less competi-
tive, and they cost American jobs. 
I actually worked in a unionized auto 
factory during college, and I saw the 
problems with unions firsthand. 
Unions 
protect 
the 
unproductive 
worker; diminish the incentive to 
stand out and be exceptional; treat ev-
eryone the same based on seniority; en-
courage an entitlement mentality; and 
foster an attitude of resentment to-
ward management. 
They have outlived their value from 
when they originated to correct what 
are now unfair and unlawful labor prac-
tices. 
Every employee should be inspired to 
progress within an organization with-
out at some point stepping over to the 
dark side because they become stig-
matized as a member of management. 
The PRO Act is an example of gov-
ernment, or this very Congress, em-
ploying its own union boss tactics to 
try to reverse the Nation’s downward 
trend in union membership. 
It is no coincidence that unions are 
among the biggest contributors to the 
Democrat party with over $200 million 
given last year alone. 
Every State should be a right-to- 
work State, and that is what we should 
encourage instead of trying to force 
union membership on the Nation’s 
workers. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, the ag-
gressive concentration of wealth in 
corporate boardrooms, the unending 
attacks on unions and their attempts 
to organize, and the passage of so- 
called right-to-work laws, which we 
now know are really the right-to-depri-
vation laws, have left America’s work-
ers begging for scraps, rather than re-
ceiving the fair compensation and full 
benefits they deserve. 
My father was a proud member of the 
Ironworkers 
Union. 
He 
showed 
up 
every day and worked hard, erecting 
buildings and bridges across New Eng-
land. 
And while he was at work, he knew 
that his union was fighting to defend 
him and his brothers and sisters and 
their families by looking out for our 
interests at the negotiating table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1150 
March 9, 2021 
It is thanks to the strong benefits 
and wages secured by his union that 
my parents were able to provide for my 
sisters and me. 
The PRO Act is about making sure 
that other families have that same 
chance. It is about restoring dignity 
and power to where it belongs: with our 
workers. 
After all, it is our workers who kept 
us afloat, fed, housed, and safe this last 
year. For that I urge this bill’s pas-
sage. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Em-
ployees in support of this bill. 
AFSCME, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 1.4 
million members of the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees 
(AFSCME), I urge you to vote Yes on the 
‘‘Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) 
Act’’ (H.R. 842). As the largest public-sector 
union our members believe that all workers, 
both private and public sector, deserve the 
right to organize and bargain collectively to 
improve their working conditions. 
Workers need a voice on the job now more 
than ever before. Since the beginning of the 
pandemic, unions have advocated for work-
ers’ safety and protections. Nurses, teachers, 
first responders, bus drivers, grocery store 
workers and other essential workers were in 
desperate need of personal protective equip-
ment and the right to use paid leave to self- 
quarantine or take care of someone who 
might have been affected, which unions 
fought for. Unions also helped to prevent 
layoffs and furloughs to save jobs and win 
additional premium pay and paid sick time. 
The value that unions provide to workers 
and their families creates a strong middle 
class that makes the economy work for all 
Americans. With high unemployment and 
people struggling to make ends meet, it is 
important to strengthen workers’ rights and 
the ability to organize. On average, a worker 
covered by a union contract earns 11.2 per-
cent more in wages than a worker in a non-
union workplace in the same sector. Living 
wages and benefits with union jobs can lead 
to job competition with nonunion jobs, help-
ing to strengthen local economies. 
The PRO Act strengthens federal laws that 
protect workers’ rights to organize and col-
lectively bargain for wages, paid leave, 
health insurance, retirement benefits, and 
workplace protections and safety. The bill 
increases penalties for employers that vio-
late workers’ rights. It strengthens support 
for workers who suffer retaliation. It pre-
vents employers from misclassifying employ-
ees, and it prohibits employers from inter-
fering in union elections. 
AFSCME strongly urges Congress to pass 
the PRO Act to build back our country and 
to get us out of this economic crisis stronger 
than before. 
Sincerely, 
BAILEY K. CHILDERS, 
Director of Federal Government Affairs. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, this 
bill is further proof that there is vir-
tually 
no 
distinction 
between 
the 
Democratic Party and unions as a po-
litical organization. 
In 1 week, Mr. Speaker, the Demo-
crats are bailing out failed union pen-
sions with tens of billions of dollars in 
taxpayer moneys, and now they are 
forcing States and workers into this 
failed union system. 
This bill is definitely prounion, but it 
is antiworker, anticompetitive, and 
antifreedom. This bill forces workers 
into unions, forces them to pay union 
dues. It deprives them of their right to 
privacy. It forces workers to divulge 
their personal information to their 
union bosses. What a racket. It would 
wreak havoc on our workers. 
Talk is cheap, Mr. Speaker, and the 
American worker isn’t buying this 
empty political rhetoric. They under-
stand the best way to protect workers 
is through progrowth, America-first 
policies that give our workers more 
freedom, more opportunity, and more 
of their hard-earned money in their 
pockets. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), the co- 
chair of the Labor Caucus. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the PRO 
Act. 
This bill supports workers in this 
country by implementing meaningful 
and enforceable penalties for compa-
nies that violate workers’ rights. 
It expands accessibility to collective 
bargaining and closes loopholes used to 
exploit workers while strengthening 
workers’ access to fair union elections. 
Unions are the bedrock of our Na-
tion’s prosperity and success. Many of 
us have been impacted by their good 
work. Healthcare benefits, pensions, 
safe working conditions, vacations, and 
holidays, 
teacher-to-student 
ratios, 
nurse-to-patient ratios were all nego-
tiated and pushed forward by unions. 
Too many of us take for granted bene-
fits that we enjoy because of hard- 
fought battles by unions. 
A January 2021 Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics report highlights that nonunion 
worker median weekly earnings were 84 
percent of earnings for workers who 
were union members. Further research 
also underscores that strong unions 
lead to higher wages for all workers, 
regardless of their union status. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the International Federa-
tion of Professional and Technical En-
gineers. 
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF PRO-
FESSIONAL
& 
TECHNICAL
ENGI-
NEERS, AFL-CIO & CLC, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of 90,000 
workers represented by the International 
Federation of Professional and Technical En-
gineers (IFPTE), we urge you to vote for the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021, 
H.R. 842 (PRO Act). The bipartisan PRO Act, 
sponsored by House Education and Labor 
Chair Bobby Scott, restores the original in-
tent of the National Labor Relations Act of 
1935 (NLRA) and levels the playing field be-
tween workers who want to form unions and 
employers who exploit weaknesses in the 
current law to frustrate union organizing 
drives and interfere with workers’ legal 
rights to organize and bargain collectively. 
If enacted, the PRO Act would counter the 
all-too-common anti-union intimidation tac-
tics that workers who are organizing a union 
are subjected to. For example, upwards of 50 
professionals employed by Animal Legal De-
fense Fund (ALDF) are currently voting by 
mail to form a union with the Nonprofit Pro-
fessional Employees Union-IFPTE Local 70 
(NPEU) so that they can have a voice in cre-
ating a workplace that is anti-racist, cooper-
ative, equitable, inclusive, just, respectful, 
and transparent. These are attorneys, legis-
lative affairs professionals, and communica-
tions professionals whose personal and pro-
fessional dedication to their work ties their 
working conditions to ALDF’s mission. Un-
fortunately, the employer’s anti-union cam-
paign has included spending undisclosed re-
sources to hire an anti-union firm to engage 
in some of the very anti-worker behavior 
that this bill seeks to correct. This includes 
activities such as weekly coercive union 
avoidance meetings and anti-union commu-
nication filled with misinformation, intimi-
dation aimed at discouraging union activity, 
as well as misclassifying employees as man-
agement ahead of the unionization vote. 
This bill meaningfully restores workers’ 
rights to determine for themselves if they 
want a union by providing a fair process for 
union recognition if the National Labor Re-
lations Board (NLRB) determines that the 
employer illegally interfered with the union 
representation election. Provisions in the 
bill also allow the union or the employer to 
request a mediation-arbitration process for 
first contract negotiations that take longer 
than 90 days. Language in this bill that pro-
hibits captive audience meetings and rein-
states the requirement that employers dis-
close the hiring of and compensation for 
anti-union consultants will help workers 
make informed choices when they receive in-
formation from their employers. By clari-
fying and updating the NLRA’s definitions 
for employee, supervisor, and employer, the 
PRO Act clarifies the definition of joint em-
ployer and closes loopholes that allow em-
ployers to misclassify workers. Furthermore, 
this bill gives the NLRB the authority to 
conduct economic analysis as it sets policies 
and regulations, increases penalties against 
employers who violate the NLRA, requires 
employers to reinstate workers while the 
NLRB investigates the retaliatory firing, 
and gives unions the ability to collect fair- 
share fees. 
For all the reasons above, IFPTE requests 
you vote for the PRO Act. We urge you to 
vote against any amendments that weaken 
sections of the bill, especially sections that 
prohibit and prevent the misclassification of 
workers. Further, IFPTE is hopeful that the 
Rules Committee makes in order and the 
House approves Rep. Andy Levin’s SAFE Act 
as a part of the underlying bill. The inclu-
sion of this provision would remove the long-
standing NLRB prohibition against admin-
istering union elections electronically. 
Thank you for considering our request. 
Should you have any questions, please feel 
free to contact either of us. 
Sincerely, 
PAUL SHEARON, 
President. 
MATTHEW BIGGS,

banned by the National Labor Rela-
tions Act of 1959. This bill fully resur-
rects it. 
Yet, these unfair practices continued 
post-1959 in the construction industry. 
For example, Mr. Speaker, in 2004 the 
Eighth Circuit heard a hot cargo agree-
ment case. In exchange for a no-strike 
pledge, a construction firm agreed to 
perform the work and agreed it would 
hire union workers, but they hired a 
subcontractor, who, while they didn’t 
sign the agreement, agreed to use 
union labor anyway. They went on 
strike, Mr. Speaker, even though they 
hired union workers. This is the kind 
of unfair approach that does not de-
serve to be enshrined in this bill. As a 
result, the contractor received a cease 
and desist demand and workers lost the 
opportunity to work. 
I tried to amend this bill to remove 
this hot cargo bad idea, but the amend-
ment was rejected by House Demo-
crats. 
This is an example of how this party 
wants to go back to 1959 and instill this 
for all workers across our Nation. We 
need to oppose this bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise in strong support of the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act. 
Workers sacrifice so much to keep 
our country going during this pan-
demic. They risk their safety, and 
many have lost their lives. 
But workers everywhere are also or-
ganizing to improve their working con-
ditions and keep our communities safe. 
This bill simply guarantees the right 
to fight for safety and dignity on the 
job. 
It is for Amazon workers in my 
neighborhood in Chicago fighting for 
their safety on the warehouse floor; for 
nurses demanding safe staffing levels 
in hospitals and nursing homes; for 
rideshare drivers and delivery workers 
who don’t even have basic rights at 
work. 
I urge this body to pass the PRO Act 
for them and for all of us. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Ms. FOXX for yielding. 
I rise today in support of our Na-
tion’s workers and businesses. We must 
find ways to work together to help our 
economy recover from COVID–19. 
However, this bill is not the answer, 
and it is not even close. This bill will 
nationalize the disastrous California 
policies that have forced businesses out 
of my State, killed jobs, and hurt 
workers. 
As we saw in California, businesses 
that can afford lobbyists eventually 
get carveouts, while small businesses 
are left holding the bag. 
The last thing we should be doing 
during this time is passing legislation 
that will kill jobs and make our recov-
ery even harder. From Uber and Lyft 
drivers to financial advisers to local 
artists, we should support workers’ 
freedom, our gig economy, and create 
policies to promote innovation. 
We should learn from the failings of 
AB–5 in California and vote ‘‘no’’ on 
the PRO Act. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. RYAN). 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, one of the 
earlier speakers said: ‘‘This is the most 
dramatic change in labor law in 80 
years.’’ And I say: ‘‘Thank God.’’ 
In the late seventies, a CEO’s earn-
ings were 35 times that of the worker. 
Today, it is 3 to 400 times what the 
worker makes. And our friends on the 
other side are running around with 
their hair on fire. 
Heaven forbid we pass something 
that is going to help the damn workers 
in the United States of America. Heav-
en forbid we tilt the balance that has 
been going in the wrong direction for 50 
years. 
We talk about pensions. You com-
plain. We talk about the minimum 
wage increase. You complain. We talk 
about giving them the right to orga-
nize. You complain. But if we were 
passing a tax cut here, you would all be 
getting in line to vote ‘‘yes’’ for it. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the International Asso-
ciation of Machinists and Aerospace 
Workers in support of the PRO Act. 
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS, 
Upper Marlboro, Maryland, March 9, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE, On behalf of the 
International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers, I strongly urge you to 
support the Protecting the Right to Organize 
(PRO) Act introduced by Representative 
Bobby Scott. In a functioning and recovering 
economy, working families and middle-class 
Americans cannot be left behind. 
The PRO Act is a crucially bold piece of 
legislation that modernizes federal laws and 
expands 
workers’ 
collective 
bargaining 
rights and closes loopholes that corporations 
use to exploit workers. The bill also estab-
lishes a process for mediation and arbitra-
tion to help the parties achieve a first con-
tract. It protects workers’ right to organize 
a union and bargain for higher wages and 
better benefits. 
However, the right to freely form a union 
without the threat of company intimidation 
or interference is denied to workers today. 
The PRO Act strengthens protections for 
employees that engage in collective action 
and levels the playing field by prohibiting 
employers from requiring their employees to 
attend ‘‘captive audience’’ meetings whose 
sole purpose is to convince workers to vote 
against the union. In addition to imposing fi-
nancial penalties on employers and indi-
vidual corporate offices who violate the law, 
the bill would give workers the option of 
bringing their case to federal court. 
Finally, the PRO Act would override state 
‘‘right to work’’ laws. These laws are simply 
designed to give more power to corporations 
at the expense of workers, and have had the 
effect of lowering wages and eroding pen-
sions and health care coverage in states 
where they have been adopted. 
For all the above these reasons, I respect-
fully urge you to support the PRO Act and 
vote ‘‘YES’’ on this long overdue legislation. 
Thank you, 
ROBERT MARTINEZ, JR., 
International President. 
Mr. RYAN. You need to stop talking 
about Dr. Seuss and start working with 
us on behalf of the American workers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I am using 
my inside voice. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mrs. 
LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, during 
their floor speeches today, both Speak-
er PELOSI and Leader HOYER claimed 
this bill is for the workers. 
If my Democratic colleagues care so 
much about American workers, why do 
they support incentivizing millions of 
illegal immigrants into our Nation to 
take away jobs from American work-
ers? 
Why do they support this bill that 
could force workers to pay union dues 
even if they don’t want to? 
Why do they want to take away Ari-
zona workers’ rights under the Arizo-
na’s right-to-work law? 
This bill is bad for employees. It is 
bad for employers. And it is bad for 
America. I oppose this bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
how much time is remaining on each 
side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 7 minutes re-
maining. The gentlewoman from North 
Carolina has 5 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. DESAULNIER), the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Health, 
Employment, Labor, and Pensions of 
the Education and Labor Committee. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
a proud former member of Teamsters 
Local 170 in Worcester, Massachusetts, 
and a former member of AFL–CIO 
Local 2 in San Francisco. From that 
experience, I know personally the value 
of being a union member. 
I am also a former small business 
person who knows the value of having 
good-paying jobs in a community rep-
resented by union members to small 
businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, the wealthiest Ameri-
cans continue to take home a larger 
and larger share of America’s wealth. 
According to Fed data, the top 1 per-
cent of Americans have a combined net 
worth of $34.2 trillion, which is 15 times 
more wealth than the bottom 50 per-
cent of Americans. One percent has 
more wealth than 160 million Ameri-
cans.

This is unparalleled in our existence 
and must be addressed if you really 
care about working people. This in-
equality has contributed to what is 
called diseases of despair by public 
health experts and has worsened the 
behavioral health crisis exponentially 
in this country. 
At the same time, union coverage 
today is half of what it was 40 years 
ago, and research shows deunionization

accounts for up to one-third of the in-
equality of which I speak. 
The Economic Policy Institute esti-
mates that deunionization has led to 
working people losing $200 billion per 
year, and that money goes to make in-
equality greater and goes into the al-
ready 
exceedingly 
disproportionate 
wealth by those in the 1 percent. It 
hurts all of us, including them. 
Strengthening access to unions and 
American workers being able to orga-
nize will help restore the balance of 
power between workers and employers, 
wages and capital. The research is 
clear that when workers collectively 
bargain and organize, their pay goes 
up. On average, a worker covered by a 
union contract earns 13 percent more 
than a peer in a nonunionized work-
place. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
gentleman for yielding me the time, 
and I ask my colleagues to enthusiasti-
cally support this initiative. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I heard 
the majority leader speak about some-
thing that happened in 1870 and 1880, 
like the Pinkertons are still running 
around union busting. 
Well, it is not 1870. It is not 1880. It is 
not even the time of President Obama. 
But during President Obama’s time, he 
proposed the ambush election rule, and 
that is in this bill. 
What does that mean? That means 
the employer must give up the address-
es, the contact and personal informa-
tion, and the working schedule of ev-
erybody in their facility. And they 
don’t get to say no. The people who 
work there don’t get to say no. Even 
the Obama NLRB said that they would 
be subjected to harassment, coercion, 
or robbery—or robbery. 
Madam Speaker, I offered an amend-
ment, which the majority refused, to 
close the loophole that exempts union 
violence, 
coercion, 
and 
extortion. 
Think about that, union violence. 
If they have the information of the 
employees and are prone to violence, 
and if you live in Philadelphia, you 
just go back to the helpful union guy, 
the helpful union guys, the thugs and 
the presentment. 
Reject this. This is the PRO Act, in-
deed—protecting corrupt union bosses 
from their own failures. Vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. NOR-
CROSS), a distinguished member of the 
Committee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, the 
‘‘thugs.’’ Are those the friends of the 
folks who attacked this Capitol? Is 
that who you are talking about? Those 
are thugs. 
Madam Speaker, for 44 years, I have 
been a member of the IBEW. My broth-
ers went to college. I did the other 
thing. I went to the other 4-year 
school, an apprenticeship. My entire 
life has been about speaking for those 
voices, those workers who didn’t have a 
voice. 
Listen to this: Employers shouldn’t 
make 
the 
decision, 
and 
unions 
shouldn’t make the decision. Employ-
ees make the decision whether or not 
they want to enter into a collective 
bargaining agreement. 
That is one of the reasons why I and 
five others formed the Labor Caucus, 
because their voices are not being 
heard. 
Unlimited money, the total control 
of the workplace—OSHA injuries are 
much higher on nonunion jobs than 
union jobs. Why? Because workers have 
a voice. They have better health bene-
fits; they have better pensions; they 
have dignity in retiring. 
Madam Speaker, I have spent 44 
years and have been involved with 30 
organizing campaigns. I know what it 
is like to go out and get those cards 
signed. I know what it is like to have 
a fair election, and that is what we 
need. 
Fairness in America still counts, and 
workers have been on the wrong end of 
that deal for so long. 
Madam Speaker, I am asking my col-
leagues to do what is right for Amer-
ica. Pass the PRO Act. We are all in 
this together. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I thank the 
Honorable BOBBY SCOTT for the oppor-
tunity to be heard. I will be terse. 
Madam Speaker, unions protect peo-
ple. Unions protect people because 
those workers will organize and make 
sure that there is a safe work environ-
ment. 
This is important because if not but 
for the union, many companies would 
simply build into the cost of doing 
business the injuries that may be sus-
tained. I am a member of Local 1550 of 
AFSCME and proud to say it. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation because it will save lives. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BANKS). 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, if we 
adopt the motion to recommit, we will 
instruct the Committee on Education 
and Labor to consider an amendment 
to prohibit labor organizations from 
encouraging illegal immigrants to join 
their ranks. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCANLON). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Indiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, thanks 
to the COVID–19 pandemic and onerous 
government restrictions, the last year 
has been among the toughest for work-
ing Americans in our Nation’s history. 
Congress’ foremost duty today is to 
help the millions of hurting American 
workers recover their lost jobs and 
wages. 
Madam Speaker, this bill prevents us 
from fulfilling that duty and, instead, 
prioritizes the interests of illegal im-
migrants and union bosses. 
Madam Speaker, I am the grandson 
and son of proud union members, and 
my brother works at the same factory 
in northeast Indiana and belongs to the 
same union that my dad and grand-
father and uncles and cousins, and 
many others, have as well. 
So let me tell you, it is a travesty 
that Democrats think that people who 
broke our Nation’s laws deserve the 
same labor rights as they do. This bill, 
as written, would lessen American citi-
zens’ union voting power and hand it to 
people who aren’t even legally em-
ployed. It goes against the very pur-
pose of unions: providing a forum 
where American workers can have a 
voice. 
Madam Speaker, this bill would 
disempower 
American 
workers 
by 
drowning out their voices to the ben-
efit of illegal immigrants. 
The amendment I propose is simple: 
Individuals who are not eligible to 
work in our country should not be con-
tacted or courted by labor leadership. 
If my Democratic colleagues insist on 
moving forward with this bill without 
my amendment, they wouldn’t be pro-
tecting Americans’ right to organize. 
They would be prohibiting American 
workers from organizing as a distinct 
group. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Indiana an addi-
tional 15 seconds. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, the 
Democratic Party claims to have the 
best interest of American workers at 
heart so, please, prove it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the motion to 
recommit. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is an effort 
by Democrats to cave to big labor and 
special interest groups’ demands at the 
expense of the American workforce and 
the economy. Once again, Democrats 
are attempting to ram through radical, 
partisan legislation. 
H.R. 842 is radical, backward-looking 
legislation, which will diminish the 
rights of workers and employers while 
harming the economy and providing a 
political gift to labor union special in-
terests. 
I thank my Republican colleagues for 
their hard work in fighting for Amer-
ican workers and job creators. I urge 
all of my colleagues to consider the se-
rious damage that the passage of this 
bill would do, and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1153 
March 9, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I reiterate, just be-
fore COVID hit, we had a booming, 
booming economy without this legisla-
tion. This will harm the economy, 
harm the American workers, and do 
great injustice to well-meaning em-
ployers who risk every day their cap-
ital and their energy to create jobs. 
Madam Speaker, this bill deserves a 
‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, each of us can agree 
that hard work in this country should 
pay off. Yet, for far too long, we have 
allowed wealthy special interests to 
pad the profit margins by stripping 
workers of their rights. 
Madam Speaker, we often voice our 
support for workers. Today, we have 
the opportunity to match our words 
with action by taking a historic step to 
ensure that they can stand together 
and negotiate for higher pay, better 
benefits, and safer workplaces. 
I want to recognize all the workers 
and 
advocates, 
especially 
my 
col-
leagues on the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, for their leadership 
on this legislation. 
There is an extensive legislative his-
tory underpinning this bill, including 
three hearings and a markup in the 
116th Congress. The views of the com-
mittee are outlined in the committee 
report from the last Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a Statement of Administration 
Policy in support of the PRO Act and a 
statement by President Biden on the 
House taking up the PRO Act. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 842—PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE 
ACT OF 2021—REP. SCOTT, D–VA, AND 212 CO-
SPONSORS 
The 
Administration 
strongly 
supports 
House passage of H.R. 842, the Protecting the 
Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021, which 
would strengthen the Federal laws that pro-
tect workers’ right to organize a union and 
collectively bargain for better wages, bene-
fits, and working conditions. 
America was not built by Wall Street. It 
was built by the middle class, and unions 
built the middle class. Unions put power in 
the hands of workers. They give workers a 
stronger voice to increase wages, improve 
the quality of jobs and protect job security, 
protect against racial and all other forms of 
discrimination and sexual harassment, and 
protect workers’ health, safety, and benefits 
in the workplace. Unions lift up workers, 
both union and non-union. 
The policy of the United States Govern-
ment, stated clearly in the National Labor 
Relations Act, is to encourage union orga-
nizing and collective bargaining. However, 
due to anti-union efforts by many employers 
for decades, lax enforcement of existing 
labor laws, and the failure to restore and 
strengthen labor laws to address the real- 
world of labor-management relations, only 
6.3% percent of private-sector U.S. wage and 
salary workers were union members in 2020. 
H.R. 842 would strengthen and protect 
workers’ right to form a union by allowing 
the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) 
to assess penalties on employers who violate 
workers’ right to organize and ensuring that 
workers who suffer retaliation for exercising 
these rights receive immediate relief. 
The PRO Act also defends workers’ right to 
strike—a fundamental economic right—and 
to engage in boycotts and other acts of soli-
darity with workers at other companies 
without penalty. It clarifies that employers 
may not force employees to waive their 
rights to join together in collective or class 
action litigation. The bill also closes loop-
holes in Federal labor law by barring em-
ployers from misclassifying workers as inde-
pendent contractors and preventing workers 
from being denied remedies due to their im-
migration status. It establishes an expansive 
joint employer standard, allowing workers to 
collectively bargain with all the companies 
that control the terms and conditions of 
their employment. The bill allows unions to 
collect fair-share fees to cover the cost of 
collective bargaining and administering a 
union contract for all workers who are pro-
tected by the contract’s terms. H.R. 842 re-
stores workers’ access to fair union elections 
and ensures the results are respected. 
The Administration strongly encourages 
the House to pass H.R. 842, and looks forward 
to working with the Congress to enact this 
critical legislation that safeguards workers’ 
rights to organize and bargain collectively. 
The PRO Act will strengthen our democracy 
and advance dignity in the workplace. 
STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN ON THE 
HOUSE TAKING UP THE PRO ACT 
(Statements and Releases, March 9, 2021) 
I strongly encourage the House to pass the 
Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act 
of 2021, which would dramatically enhance 
the power of workers to organize and collec-
tively bargain for better wages, benefits, and 
working conditions. 
As America works to recover from the dev-
astating challenges of deadly pandemic, an 
economic crisis, and reckoning on race that 
reveals deep disparities, we need to summon 
a new wave of worker power to create an 
economy that works for everyone. We owe it 
not only to those who have put in a lifetime 
of work, but to the next generation of work-
ers who have only known an America of ris-
ing inequality and shrinking opportunity. 
All of us deserve to enjoy America’s promise 
in full—and our nation’s leaders have a re-
sponsibility to deliver it. 
That starts with rebuilding unions. The 
middle class built this country, and unions 
built the middle class. Unions give workers a 
stronger voice to increase wages, improve 
the quality of jobs and protect job security, 
protect against racial and all other forms of 
discrimination and sexual harassment, and 
protect workers’ health, safety, and benefits 
in the workplace. Unions lift up workers, 
both union and non-union. They are critical 
to strengthening our economic competitive-
ness. 
But, after generations of sweat and sac-
rifice, fighting hard to earn the wages and 
benefits that built and sustained the Amer-
ican middle class, unions are under siege. 
Nearly 60 million Americans would join a 
union if they get a chance, but too many em-
ployers and states prevent them from doing 
so through anti-union attacks. They know 
that without unions, they can run the table 
on workers—union and non-union alike. 
We should all remember that the National 
Labor Relations Act didn’t just say that we 
shouldn’t hamstring unions or merely tol-
erate them. It said that we should encourage 
unions. The PRO Act would take critical 
steps to help restore this intent. 
I urge Congress to send the PRO Act to my 
desk so we can seize the opportunity to build 
a future that reflects working people’s cour-
age and ambition, and offers not only good 
jobs with a real choice to join a union—but 
the dignity, equity, shared prosperity and 
common purpose the hardworking people 
who built this country and make it run de-
serve. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize Act, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 842, the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021, 
or the PRO Act. 
For too long, wealthy corporations and em-
ployers have dictated the stability and success 
of working and middle-class Americans—often 
without their best interests in mind. The PRO 
Act seeks to combat this injustice by providing 
increased opportunities for workers to orga-
nize, holding employers accountable for viola-
tions of workers’ rights, and securing free, fair, 
and safe union elections. 
The timing of the vote on this legislation is 
crucial. We have watched as the COVID–19 
pandemic has further exacerbated the existing 
inequalities in our economy. The rich have 
gotten richer, while the employees on the front 
lines have faced harsh conditions, risks to 
their health, and a minimal, at best, increase 
in pay. It is therefore critical that these work-
ers be able to exercise their right to organize 
a union so that they can advocate as one for 
higher wages, better benefits, and safer work-
ing conditions. 
As a dues-paying, active member of the 
American Federation of Government Employ-
ees (AFGE), I have seen firsthand the impor-
tant role that unions play in empowering work-
ers across the country. And I will continue to 
be a strong advocate for workers’ rights—be-
cause our country is only as strong as our 
workers. 
Madam Speaker, a strong middle class is 
essential to a strong economy. That is why I 
am proud to support the PRO Act and would 
encourage its immediate consideration in the 
Senate. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the passage of the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act, a piece of 
legislation of which I am a proud co-sponsor. 
Importantly, this bill protects workers’ rights to 
unionize, holds employers accountable for vio-
lating workers’ rights, and ensures unions can 
have free, fair, and safe elections. By empow-
ering workers to exercise their rights to orga-
nize, workers will be given the power to over-
ride ‘‘right-to-work’’ laws that prevent unions 
from collecting dues from the workers they 
represent. 
It is significant to me that this body is com-
ing together to pass this legislation on the 
same day as Mr. Joseph ‘‘Joe’’ Girolamo’s 
100th birthday. Mr. Girolamo of Livonia, Michi-
gan is a veteran of World War II and the son 
of Italians, family he had a chance to visit 
while serving overseas. In a recent interview 
with Hometown Life, Mr. Girolamo shared that 
after returning home he moved to Livonia with 
his late wife Lillian. They met playing music 
and settled down in 1953. Mr. Girolamo 
worked at the River Rouge complex in Dear-
born. He witnessed workers being treated un-
fairly and became a union man, and spent 
years advocating for workers’ rights. His 
daughter Joyce Hermann shared with Home-
town Life, ‘‘So, there were actually thugs and 
goons running the place. It was a difficult situ-
ation until the union came in. He made sure

everything was done by the book and his 
workers weren’t doing anything unsafe. It was 
a really big change back then.’’ 
Earlier today as I wished Mr. Girolamo by 
phone a Happy Birthday and thanked him for 
his work with the American Legion and the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars, I got to listen to 
him play his harmonica and proudly informed 
him that today we were passing the PRO Act. 
He informed me he was smiling over the 
phone and glad to hear it. 
When I think about the legacy and shoul-
ders of giants we stand on in the Congress, 
it’s incredible patriots like Joe, who represent 
the best of America and Michigan. I am proud 
and grateful we were able to take another pro-
ductive step in the direction of the working 
men and woman in this country and all they 
are counting on to earn a decent living and 
save for retirement.

final order, a proceeding under this sub-
section may be terminated on the basis of a 
settlement agreement entered into by the 
Secretary of Labor, the complainant, and the 
person alleged to have committed the viola-
tion. 
‘‘(B) AVAILABLE RELIEF.—

the person who committed such violation— 
‘‘(I) to take affirmative action to abate the 
violation; 
‘‘(II) to reinstate the complainant to his or

pensation (including back pay with interest)

‘‘(III) to provide compensatory damages to 
the complainant; and 
‘‘(IV) expungement of all warnings, rep-
rimands, or derogatory references that have 
been placed in paper or electronic records or 
databases of any type relating to the actions 
by the complainant that gave rise to the un-
favorable personnel action, and, at the com-
plainant’s direction, transmission of a copy 
of the decision on the complaint to any per-
son whom the complainant reasonably be-
lieves may have received such unfavorable 
information. 
‘‘(ii) COSTS AND EXPENSES.—If an order is 
issued under clause (i), the Secretary of 
Labor, at the request of the complainant, 
shall assess against the person against whom 
the order is issued, a sum equal to the aggre-
gate amount of all costs and expenses (in-
cluding attorney fees and expert witness 
fees) reasonably incurred, as determined by 
the Secretary of Labor, by the complainant 
for, or in connection with, the bringing of 
the complaint upon which the order was 
issued. 
‘‘(C) FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS.—If the Secretary 
of Labor finds that a complaint under para-
graph (1) is frivolous or has been brought in 
bad faith, the Secretary of Labor may award 
to the prevailing employer or labor organiza-
tion a reasonable attorney fee, not exceeding 
$1,000, to be paid by the complainant.

the Secretary of Labor has not issued a final 
order within 270 days after the date of filing 
of a complaint under this subsection, or 
within 90 days after the date of receipt of a 
written determination, the complainant may 
bring an action at law or equity for de novo 
review in the appropriate district court of 
the United States having jurisdiction, which 
shall have jurisdiction over such an action 
without regard to the amount in con-
troversy, and which action shall, at the re-
quest of either party to such action, be tried 
by the court with a jury. 
‘‘(ii) PROCEDURES.—A proceeding under 
clause (i) shall be governed by the same legal 
burdens of proof specified in paragraph (3). 
The court shall have jurisdiction to grant all 
relief necessary to make the employee 
whole, including injunctive relief and com-
pensatory damages, including— 
‘‘(I) reinstatement with the same seniority 
status that the employee would have had, 
but for the discharge or discrimination; 
‘‘(II) the amount of back pay, with inter-
est; 
‘‘(III) compensation for any special dam-
ages sustained as a result of the discharge or 
discrimination, including litigation costs, 
expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney 
fees; and 
‘‘(IV) expungement of all warnings, rep-
rimands, or derogatory references that have 
been placed in paper or electronic records or 
databases of any type relating to the actions 
by the complainant that gave rise to the un-
favorable personnel action, and, at the com-
plainant’s direction, transmission of a copy 
of the decision on the complaint to any per-
son whom the complainant reasonably be-
lieves may have received such unfavorable 
information. 
‘‘(E) OTHER
APPEALS.—Unless the com-
plainant brings an action under subpara-
graph (D), any person adversely affected or 
aggrieved by a final order issued under sub-
paragraph (A) may file a petition for review 
of the order in the United States Court of 
Appeals for the circuit in which the violation 
with respect to which the order was issued, 
allegedly occurred or the circuit in which 
the complainant resided on the date of such 
violation, not later than 60 days after the 
date of the issuance of the final order of the 
Secretary of Labor under subparagraph (A). 
Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5, 
United States Code. The commencement of 
proceedings under this subparagraph shall 
not, unless ordered by the court, operate as 
a stay of the order. An order of the Secretary 
of Labor with respect to which review could 
have been obtained under this subparagraph 
shall not be subject to judicial review in any 
criminal or other civil proceeding. 
‘‘(5) FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ORDER.— 
‘‘(A) ACTIONS
BY
THE
SECRETARY.—If any 
person has failed to comply with a final 
order issued under paragraph (4), the Sec-
retary of Labor may file a civil action in the 
United States district court for the district 
in which the violation was found to have oc-
curred, or in the United States district court 
for the District of Columbia, to enforce such 
order. In actions brought under this para-
graph, the district courts shall have jurisdic-
tion to grant all appropriate relief including 
injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive 
damages. 
‘‘(B) CIVIL
ACTIONS
TO
COMPEL
COMPLI-
ANCE.—A person on whose behalf an order 
was issued under paragraph (4) may com-
mence a civil action against the person to 
whom such order was issued to require com-
pliance with such order. The appropriate 
United States district court shall have juris-
diction, without regard to the amount in 
controversy or the citizenship of the parties, 
to enforce such order. 
‘‘(C) AWARD
OF
COSTS
AUTHORIZED.—The 
court, in issuing any final order under this 
paragraph, may award costs of litigation (in-
cluding reasonable attorney and expert wit-
ness fees) to any party, whenever the court 
determines such award is appropriate.

discretionary duty imposed by this section 
shall be enforceable in a mandamus pro-
ceeding brought under section 1361 of title 28, 
United States Code.

MENTS.—Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of law, the rights and remedies provided 
for in this section may not be waived by any 
agreement, policy, form, or condition of em-
ployment, including by any predispute arbi-
tration agreement. 
‘‘(e) SAVINGS.—Nothing in this subsection 
shall be construed to diminish the rights, 
privileges, or remedies of any employee who

ant to House Resolution 188, the gen-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY). 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of my amend-
ment in the en bloc package. If it is ap-
proved, I will vote for the bill. 
The PRO Act aims to protect the 
right of workers to decide whether to 
form a union that can negotiate with 
their employer over working condi-
tions. It proceeds from the principle 
that America is stronger when the mid-
dle class is stronger, and the middle 
class is stronger when unions are 
stronger. 
This principle is personal to me. I 
grew up in Virginia, and my dad 
worked at a power plant and he was in 
a union. He was a refugee from Viet-
nam. He had an incredible work ethic, 
but he struggled with English and re-
lied on the union to fight for him to 
have 
a 
living 
wage 
and 
good 
healthcare. This allowed our family to 
have 
opportunities 
we 
otherwise 
wouldn’t have had. 
There are many provisions in the 
PRO Act I support. There are also pro-
visions that give me pause, especially 
the changes made to the definitions of 
employee and joint employer in the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Edu-
cation 
and 
Labor 
Committee 
and 
Democratic 
leadership 
for 
working

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1157 
March 9, 2021 
with me to craft an amendment that 
addresses my concerns enough for me 
to support the PRO Act passage. My 
amendment requires GAO to prepare a 
report on the impact of these two 
changes on workers in businesses. The 
President is required to consider the 
report, and he can recommend that 
Congress modify one or both of these 
definitions. 
My amendment also expresses the 
sense of the House that Congress shall 
consider whether to accept, reject, or 
modify any recommendations received 
from the President. This is called evi-
dence-based 
policymaking, 
and 
we 
should do more of it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
my amendment. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the Democrat en bloc amendments. 
My Democrat colleagues are rushing a 
radical piece of legislation to the 
House floor without holding a single 
committee hearing or markup. Rushing 
sweeping, one-sided legislation to the 
floor without any prior debate or con-
sideration this year silences Members 
of the minority. This is an outright as-
sault on the legislative process and 
serves only to hide the Democrats’ so-
cialist agenda. 
There are 20 new members on the 
Education and Labor Committee on 
both sides of the aisle, not to mention 
the dozens of new Members of the 
House, and their constituents deserve 
to have their elected representatives 
examine this dangerous bill. 
Additionally, the last time the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee held a 
hearing on any version of the PRO Act 
was July 2019. Since that time, a world-
wide pandemic has devastated large 
sectors of the American economy. In 
light of this fact alone, Congress 
should hear from affected stakeholders 
before passing a radical sweeping bill. 
Even more concerning than the muz-
zle imposed by this sham legislative 
process on the minority party and busi-
ness owners around the country is the 
underlying bill’s silencing and dis-
enfranchisement of workers. This far- 
reaching legislation is nothing more 
than a union boss wish list aimed at re-
warding Democrats’ big labor allies at 
the expense of American workers. 
Union membership in the United 
States has been decreasing for over 60 
years, and continues to plummet due 
to the modern economy and unions’ 
own failings. But instead of increasing 
transparency and accountability to 
serve 
their 
members 
better, 
labor 
union leaders are demanding House 
Democrats pass the PRO Act to tilt the 
scales in their favor. Democrats are 
doing exactly that, no matter the cost. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to re-
mind my colleagues that Federal law 
already protects the right of employees 
to organize, and Republicans respect 
that right. But any reforms to U.S. 
labor laws should help workers flourish 
in 
the 
modern 
economy. 
Unfortu-
nately, the extreme bill before us today 
helps union bosses at the expense of 
workers. 
The slate of Democrat amendments 
included in this en bloc amendment are 
ploys disguised as policy intended to 
provide political cover to the Democrat 
Members who are uncomfortable voting 
for the job-destroying underlying bill, 
and, in many cases, the amendments 
included make the bill even worse. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject this partisan en bloc 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship. 
Madam Speaker, I rise enthusiasti-
cally to support the PRO Act and its 
protection against executives and com-
panies who violate workers’ rights, its 
support for collective bargaining, and 
also its access to fair elections with 
unions. 
I rise to support my amendment, 
number 9. The Jackson Lee amendment 
is direct. The amendment explicitly ex-
tends whistleblower protections to em-
ployees, both employers, and unions, 
under the Labor Management Report-
ing and Disclosure Act. I am grateful 
to the unions and to the committee for 
working with this very important 
amendment. 
It extends whistleblower protection 
to all employees of employers or of 
unions to encourage and empower them 
to come forward and make known that 
something is wrong. 
Ms. Lawson, who was in a fight for 
$15, worked for a fast food industry. 
She was sexually harassed. She needs 
that kind of protection. So this amend-
ment is very strong and adds to this 
very strong initiative. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Jack-
son Lee Amendment No. 9 included in the 
Chairman’s En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 842, 
the ‘‘Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 
2021,’’ or ‘‘PRO Act,’’ which protects the basic 
right to join a union by (1) empowering work-
ers to exercise their right to organize; (2) hold-
ing employers accountable for violating work-
ers’ rights; and (3) securing free, fair, and safe 
union elections. 
The LMRDA of 1959 protects union mem-
bers through a ‘‘bill of rights’’ for union mem-
bers, requires extensive reporting of union fi-
nances, and mandates transparency of ar-
rangements between employers and anti-labor 
consultants. 
I am pleased that the PRO Act includes re-
forms to the LMRDA that clarify that employ-
ers must disclose arrangements with consult-
ants on indirectly persuading employees on 
how to exercise their labor rights. 
Examples of indirect persuasion include 
planning employee meetings, training em-
ployer representatives, and identifying employ-
ees for disciplinary action or targeting. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9 makes 
a simple common-sense improvement to the 
bill. 
The identical version of this amendment 
was made in order by the Rules Committee in 
the 116th Congress and adopted by the 
House on February 6, 2020, by a roll call vote 
of 404–18. 
Specifically, the amendment explicitly ex-
tends whistleblower protections to employees 
of both employers and unions under the Labor 
Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. 
This is a fair and balanced amendment. 
Supreme Court decisions like Janus v. 
AFSCME, 585 U.S.ll138 S. Ct. 2448, 201 
L. Ed. 2d 924 (2018), and many others, have 
severely weakened the ability for unions to be 
able to organize and bargain collectively, or to 
discharge an essential mediating function 
upon which a vibrant democracy depends. 
The PRO Act protects the workers who are 
trying to organize. 
But the Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9 ex-
tends whistleblower protections to all employ-
ees, of employers or of unions, to encourage 
and empower them to come forward and 
make known something wrong or unlawful that 
they have learned or observed. 
Let me give you an example. 
Last year, I met Kimberly Lawson, who is 
part of the Fight for $15. 
She also came to see me to advise me of 
the problems she has had with sexual harass-
ment on her job in the fast-food industry. 
She told me, on the record, that if we could 
pass the PRO Act, she would not be alone try-
ing to raise our hourly wage or face sexual 
harassment without a union to help her. 
Madam Speaker, this whistleblower protec-
tion is important because it gives workers like 
Ms. Lawson the ability to be able to report 
what is happening to them without losing or 
jeopardizing their jobs and the ability, like Ms. 
Lawson, to support her children on the income 
of a single mother. 
Our economy needs a strong middle class, 
and unions are essential to rebuilding Amer-
ica’s middle class and improving the lives of 
workers and their families. 
When workers have the power to stand to-
gether and form a union, they have higher 
wages, better benefits, and safer working con-
ditions. 
Protecting workers’ rights to organize will 
help rebuild the middle class and improve the 
quality of life for workers and their families. 
Unions are essential to rebuilding America’s 
middle class and improving the lives of work-
ers and their families because they deliver 
higher wages, better benefits, and safer work-
ing conditions. 
Unions deliver bigger paychecks for both 
union and nonunion workers. 
Over the last eight decades, unions have 
consistently provided workers with a 10- to 20- 
percent higher wage. 
The benefits of union membership are so 
strong that even the children of union workers 
enjoy greater economic mobility. 
When union density is high, even nonunion 
workers receive higher wages. 
Unions provide workers with a voice on the 
job to bargain for better wages and safer 
working conditions. 
While the entire economy has suffered from 
massive job loss during the pandemic, union 
workers suffered fewer job losses because 
they were able to bargain with employers on 
how to respond to the pandemic. 
Unions deliver greater access to affordable 
health care and a more secure retirement. 
Private sector workers covered by a union 
contract are 27 percent more likely to be of-
fered health insurance through their employer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1158 
March 9, 2021 
More than 9 in 10 unionized private sector 
workers have access to a retirement plan, 
compared to just 65 percent of nonunion work-
ers. 
Unions narrow both the racial wealth gap 
and the gender pay gap. 
About two-thirds (65 percent) of workers 
age 18 to 64 who are covered by a union con-
tract are women and/or people of color. 
Union members of color have almost five 
times the median wealth of their nonunion 
counterparts. 
Unions are one of the most effective solu-
tions for closing the gender pay gap. 
I urge all members to join me in supporting 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9 by voting for 
the En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 842, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, 
of 2021. 
I want to remind us that, in the early 
1900s, women worked in factories where 
they died. They simply died because 
there were no provisions, no protec-
tions; and they died with drastic fires 
and other devastating actions. 
Madam Speaker, I ask support of this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
a letter of support for the 
Jackson Lee amendment from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Project. It 
reads that they think that this is an 
especially important initiative to be 
added. I ask that in support. 
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
Hon. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
Member of Congress, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE LEE: Thank you for 
your leadership through legislation to add 
whistleblower protection rights to the Labor 
Management Reporting and Disclosure Act 
of 1959. That law strives for union account-
ability to its members and in management 
relations. Your bill reflects best practice 
rights that Congress has passed 16 times 
since 2005 in laws throughout the private sec-
tor. However, the reality is that not only 
employers abuse power and undermine work-
er rights. This legislation protects those who 
seek accountability within and by organiza-
tions whose mission is to protect employees. 
As summarized below, your legislation 
would honor best practices by— 
prohibiting retaliation against applicants, 
employees or former employees who are per-
ceived as disclosing or assisting to disclose 
violations of the Act’s provisions; 
protecting both front line and management 
employees from retaliation; 
extending identical protection to those 
who refuse to obey orders to violate the law; 
providing an administrative remedy at the 
U.S. Department of Labor, with the right to 
a jury trial in federal court if there is not a 
timely decision; 
governing enforcement with realistic Whis-
tleblower Protection Act legal burdens of 
proof; and 
so employees do not lose by winning, pro-
viding ‘‘make whole’’ remedies for those who 
prevail, including cancelation of all career 
damage, compensatory damages and costs in-
cluding attorney fees. 
Unless there are loopholes in the political 
mandate for accountability, this legislation 
should not be controversial. It merely ap-
plies almost identical legal rights in the 
labor-management context that Congress 
has enacted since 2005 for financial, food 
safety, consumer protection, energy, medical 
insurance 
and 
transportation 
whistle-
blowers. Thank you for your leadership. 
Please consider Government Accountability 
Project on call for further assistance. 
Sincerely, 
TOM DEVINE, 
Legal Director. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I ask support of the Jackson Lee 
amendment in the en bloc amendment 
No. 1. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
842, the ‘‘Protecting the Right to Organize Act 
of 2021, or ‘‘PRO Act,’’ which protects the 
basic right to join a union by (1) empowering 
workers to exercise their right to organize; (2) 
holding employers accountable for violating 
workers’ rights; and (3) securing free, fair, and 
safe union elections. 
Our economy needs a strong middle class, 
and unions are essential to rebuilding Amer-
ica’s middle class and improving the lives of 
workers and their families. 
The erosion of America’s middle-class is a 
direct result of decades-long assault on work-
ers’ rights, funded by wealthy special interests. 
When workers have the power to stand to-
gether and form a union, they have higher 
wages, better benefits, and safer working con-
ditions. 
Workers seeking to organize a union fre-
quently face a surge of intimidation and retal-
iation from wealthy special interests. 
After decades of anti-worker attacks, union 
membership is at historic lows and inequality 
is at historic highs. 
It is imperative that we begin to recognize 
that the American people support unions— 
over 64 percent of Americans and millennials 
appreciate the idea of having representation 
for better quality of life and work. 
When workers have the power to stand to-
gether and form a union, they have higher 
wages, better benefits, and safer working con-
ditions. 
Protecting workers’ rights to organize will 
help rebuild the middle class and improve the 
quality of life for workers and their families. 
Unions are essential to rebuilding America’s 
middle class and improving the lives of work-
ers and their families because they deliver 
higher wages, better benefits, and safer work-
ing conditions. 
Workers with strong unions have been able 
to set industry standards for wages and bene-
fits that help all workers, both union and non-
union. 
Over the last eight decades, unions have 
consistently provided workers with a 10- to 20- 
percent higher wage. 
The benefits of union membership are so 
strong that even the children of union workers 
enjoy greater economic mobility. 
Unions provide workers with a voice on the 
job to bargain for better wages and safer 
working conditions, and never has it been 
more important that all workers have a voice 
in the workplace and access to a union. 
While the majority of workers who are cur-
rently working onsite at their workplaces be-
lieve they face considerable risk of COVID–19 
infection, Black and Hispanic workers are 
more likely to fear risks from work than are 
White workers. 
In fact, Black workers make up one in six of 
all front-line industry workers, putting them 
and their family members at greater risk of 
contracting and spreading COVID–19. 
Without unions, many workers are forced to 
work without personal protective equipment or 
access to paid leave or premium pay. 
When nonunion workers have advocated for 
health and safety protections or wage in-
creases, they have often been retaliated 
against or even fired for doing so. 
Workers’ lives and the health and safety of 
working families depends on their ability to 
have a say in how they do their jobs. 
While the entire economy has suffered from 
massive job loss during the pandemic, union 
workers suffered fewer job losses because 
they were able to bargain with employers on 
how to respond to the pandemic. 
Unions deliver greater access to affordable 
health care and a more secure retirement. 
Private sector workers covered by a union 
contract are 27 percent more likely to be of-
fered health insurance through their employer. 
More than 9 in 10 unionized private sector 
workers have access to a retirement plan, 
compared to just 65 percent of nonunion work-
ers 
Unions narrow both the racial wealth gap 
and the gender pay gap. 
The right to a union and collective bar-
gaining is also directly relevant to our urgent 
national conversation around racial inequality 
in its various forms, including economic dis-
parities by race. 
Unions and collective bargaining help shrink 
the Black-White wage gap, and this means 
that the decline of unionization has played a 
significant role in the expansion of the Black- 
White wage gap over the last four decades, 
and that an increase in unionization could help 
reverse those trends. 
About two-thirds (65 percent) of workers 
age 18 to 64 who are covered by a union con-
tract are women and/or people of color. 
Union members of color have almost five 
times the median wealth of their nonunion 
counterparts. 
Unions are one of the most effective solu-
tions for closing the gender pay gap. 
Madam Speaker, here are 36 reasons why 
Americans should be thankful for unions and 
remain committed to ensuring there will al-
ways be a strong organized labor movement 
in the United States: 
1. Weekends 
2. All breaks at work, including your lunch 
breaks 
3. Paid vacation

ees

of 1967

hibits Employer from using a lie detector test

I urge all members to join me in supporting 
H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act, or PRO Act, of 2021. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to the PRO Act 
and to these amendments. 
The PRO Act will ban right-to-work 
laws in 27 States. It will give unions 
millions more dollars to funnel to 
Democrats by requiring all workers to 
pay dues via payroll deduction, even if 
they don’t support the union. 
From 2010 to 2018, unions sent $1.6 
billion from employee dues to leftwing 
groups, such as Planned Parenthood 
and the Clinton Foundation. The PRO 
Act will require companies to provide 
union organizers their private, per-
sonal contact information of employ-
ees so they can be pressured, harassed, 
and intimidated into supporting the 
union. 
It will eliminate secret ballots and 
replace those with card check, where 
union bosses can simply collect author-
ization cards supposedly from employ-
ees agreeing to organize. If the Union 
doesn’t win the election, it puts the 
burden on employees to prove they 
didn’t engage in unfair labor practices 
to influence the outcome. 
The PRO Act destroys the franchise 
model, independent contractor status, 
subcontractors, and gig workers by im-
plementing a one-size-fits-all new em-
ployee classification. It repeals the ban 
on secondary boycotts and subjects 
suppliers and affiliates to union pres-
sure, harassment, and intimidation 
tactics just because they do business 
with the company that is under attack. 
It prohibits the replacement of strik-
ing workers, giving unions and employ-
ers risk-free leverage, unless the com-
pany closes; and eliminates the em-
ployer’s ability to serve customers and 
operate during a strike. It massively 
increases fines and other penalties for 
employers. 
The PRO Act will cost American 
businesses $47 billion annually, and I 
urge its rejection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the millions of 
American workers whose rights have 
been undermined and attacked for dec-
ades in this country. I am from a union 
family. 
Americans who have been on the 
front lines of this pandemic since day 
one, yet they have been forced to work 
with lousy benefits, in unsafe condi-
tions, and for insufficient pay. Too 
many of these workers don’t have the 
ability to organize for stronger rights 
because too many don’t even know 
their rights to organize. 
Many times, employers deliberately 
don’t want their workers to know their 
rights to organize and they hide it. 
Other times, it is because a worker’s 
rights are posted in a language that he 
or she does not speak. 
By passing the PRO Act, we will not 
only require employers to post notices 
informing workers of their rights to or-
ganize, but with the amendment I am 
proposing, we will also ensure that 
these notices are posted in the lan-
guages spoken by their employees, 
such as Spanish, Arabic, Polish, and 
any language, really. When one worker 
doesn’t know their rights, the entire 
workforce is weakened. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass this amendment and 
the PRO Act so we can truly restore 
workers’ rights in this country. All 
workers have rights. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Georgia (Ms. BOURDEAUX). 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my amend-
ment, which clarifies that the PRO Act 
does not expand the National Labor 
Relations Board’s jurisdiction over the 
smallest of small businesses, who help 
drive the economy in my district and 
across the country. 
The NLRB uses metrics to determine 
whether a company affects interstate 
commerce, and, thus, is subject to its 
enforcement and standards with dif-
ferent thresholds for different types of 
businesses. My amendment ensures 
that these thresholds do not change. 
In other words, my amendment pro-
vides certainty to the small family-run 
businesses found throughout my dis-
trict because the labor standards they 
are subject to will not change under 
this bill. My amendment protects our 
employees while maintaining stability 
for small businesses that are already 
under so much strain. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this amendment. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), a 
member of the committee. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of this en 
bloc amendment, including my amend-
ment to develop a system and proce-
dures to conduct union elections elec-
tronically. 
Last week, I was in Bessemer, Ala-
bama, supporting workers fighting to 
form a union at an Amazon warehouse. 
Amazon, the company that got us all 
to stay home instead of going to a 
store in person, demanded an in-person 
election for 5,800 workers in the middle 
of a COVID hotspot, but the NLRB or-
dered a safer mail ballot election in-
stead. Amazon circumvented that rul-
ing and had a mailbox placed in the 
parking lot under a tent covered in 
antiunion propaganda, and urged em-
ployees to vote there. 
This is why the PRO Act gives work-
ers the right to choose the method of 
their own election, so they can vote 
away from such coercive environments. 
Electronic 
union 
elections 
aren’t 
new. The National Mediation Board has 
conducted secure electronic elections 
in the rail and airline industries for al-
most two decades without a single 
problem. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment and 
the PRO Act. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, workers 
in our Nation deserve human dignity. 
That means the right to fight for safe-
ty and fairness in the workplace, as 
residents in my district know this all 
too well because we birthed the labor 
rights movement. 
One of the most important provisions 
in the PRO Act provides for mediation 
and arbitration if the employer and 
union cannot agree to a first collective 
bargaining agreement. 
My 
amendment 
guarantees 
that 
there will be no undue delay providing 
workers that agreement. Currently, al-
most 50 percent of unions fail to reach 
an agreement within a year with the 
employer. So my amendment specifies 
that the arbitration panel must issue a 
decision within 120 days. This furthers 
the core purpose of the bill by pre-
venting employers from delaying this 
and putting the harm on workers. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, a law is only as strong as the 
power to enforce it. For far too long, 
the NLRB has been too powerless to 
enforce the National Labor Relations 
Act. For too long, workers have been 
left to largely fend for themselves in 
the face of retaliation and intimidation 
and arbitration. 
The PRO Act would breathe new life 
into the National Labor Relations Act. 
It would empower the NLRB to impose 
civil penalties on and empower workers 
to seek punitive damages against retal-
iatory employers. Most importantly, 
the PRO Act would preempt the Or-
wellian right-to-work laws so that 
union organizing is given the freedom

to flourish everywhere in the United 
States. 
The PRO Act requires an employer to 
disclose every time it seeks the serv-
ices of a professional union-buster. 
b 1430 
I am proud to introduce an amend-
ment that requires DOL to make these 
disclosures available through an app. 
App-based notification would empower 
essential workers to be vigilant in de-
fending their essential right to orga-
nize. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, these amendments 
will provide whistle-blower protection 
for workers, expose violations of the 
Labor-Management Reporting and Dis-
closure Act, require the Department of 
Labor to make employment arrange-
ments and payments to union avoid-
ance firms available and more acces-
sible, clarify that nothing in the bill 
would expand the National Labor Rela-
tions Board’s jurisdictional standards, 
direct the NLRB to establish a system 
of electronic voting in representation 
elections, clarify that nothing in the 
bill will be construed to amend the def-
inition of employer or employee in any 
provisions of State law, direct the GAO 
to produce a study of the use of sec-
toral bargaining in peer nations, re-
quire that workers are informed of 
their rights under the bill in a lan-
guage that they actually speak, direct 
the GAO to produce a study of the im-
pact of the PRO Act’s changes to the 
definitions of employee and employer, 
adds a 120-day timeline for the arbitra-
tion process when workers and employ-
ers are unable to reach a first bar-
gaining agreement, and confirms that 
the bill will not affect existing provi-
sions for worker privacy. 
These amendments make meaningful 
improvements to the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on en bloc 1, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, as the party that 
claims to champion the working class, 
Democrats have certainly missed the 
mark with this bill. 
H.R. 842 will force employers to hand 
over workers’ private, personal infor-
mation to union organizers without 
workers having any say in the matter 
or making sure their information will 
not be shared with others. This would 
make it even easier for union orga-
nizers to target, harass, and intimidate 
workers. 
H.R. 842 also overturns all State 
right-to-work laws. These 27 State laws 
allow workers to decide for themselves 
whether to join a union and pay dues. 
If the PRO Act becomes law, workers 
will be forced to take money from their 
paychecks and give it to labor unions 
even if they don’t want to be rep-
resented by a union. This is aston-
ishing since we know that from 2010 to 
2018 unions spent $1.6 billion in member 
dues on hundreds of left-leaning groups 
such as Planned Parenthood, the Clin-
ton Foundation, and the Progressive 
Democrats of America without con-
sulting their members. 
The PRO Act will also undermine 
workers’ right to vote by secret ballot 
by 
imposing 
a 
biased 
card-check 
scheme in which workers could be 
unionized without the union winning a 
secret ballot election. Every Member of 
Congress is elected by secret ballot, 
and House Democrats elect their own 
caucus leadership by secret ballot; yet 
they want to deprive American work-
ers of that same protection by passing 
the PRO Act. 
The bill also deprives individuals of 
entrepreneurial opportunities, the abil-
ity to set their own hours, and the 
flexibility to care for children and fam-
ily members by creating burdensome 
and discredited legal standards for de-
termining joint employment and inde-
pendent contractor status. The PRO 
Act means the elimination of the fran-
chise industry and sharing economy as 
we know them. 
The bottom line is the underlying 
bill is shameful, and so is the process 
under which it is being considered. The 
Democrats’ en bloc package of amend-
ments does nothing to change that. 
H.R. 842 is radical, backwards-looking 
legislation which will diminish the 
rights of workers and employers while 
harming the economy and providing a 
political gift to labor union special in-
terests. 
We are better than this. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this en bloc 
package, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 188, the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina

utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Republican en bloc amendments. 
Madam Speaker, of the 58 amend-
ments submitted by Republicans, un-
fortunately only nine were made in 
order, and I remind my colleagues that 
no committee markup was held on the 
bill, which prevented any amendments 
from being considered prior to today. 
The Republican amendments high-
light the radical and flawed approach 
H.R. 842 takes which would completely 
unbalance American labor law in favor 
of unions while diminishing worker 
freedom. 
I will briefly mention several of the 
amendments which are included in this 
en bloc package: Mr. ALLEN’s amend-
ment strikes the provision that over-
turns 27 right-to-work laws which en-
sure workers do not have to join or pay 
dues to a union if they choose not to. 
Mr. COMER’s amendment strikes the 
provision that would require attorney 
and consultants to disclose to the Fed-
eral Government the agreements they 
have with employers even if the attor-
ney or consultant never has any con-
tact with employees. 
Mr. FITZGERALD’s amendment pro-
tects worker paychecks by requiring 
that unions receive express consent to 
spend their money on activities unre-
lated to collective bargaining, such as 
politics. 
Mr. GOOD’s amendment highlights 
the often coercive nature of so-called 
neutrality agreements entered by an 
employer and union during an orga-
nizing drive. 
Representative KELLER’s amendment 
removes the provision that would allow 
intermittent strikes which would be in-
credibly disruptive to small businesses, 
and the amendment also removes the 
provision that would prohibit employ-
ers from replacing workers perma-
nently to keep businesses open. 
Representative 
WALBERG’s 
amend-
ment would give employers a reason-
able amount of time to prepare for a 
free election hearing which is espe-
cially important for small businesses 
who have no HR personnel or in-house 
attorney. 
Mr. WILSON’s amendment would en-
sure that workers across the country 
do not have to join or pay dues to a 
union if that is their choice. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot 
about complaints about the dues but 
what we don’t hear are complaints 
about the higher salaries, safer work-
places, and better benefits that are ac-
crued by virtue of investments from 
the unions. They enjoy those benefits, 
so it is not unreasonable to expect peo-
ple to pay a fair share of those costs. 
Now, fair share does not include the 
political activities, does not include 
the annual holiday parties, but those 
services that the union is obligated by 
law to provide, negotiating salaries, 
negotiating a safe workplace, individ-
ualized representation when necessary, 
whatever they do for union members 
they have to do for nonunion members, 
a fair share of those expenses is not un-
reasonable. 
Madam Speaker, I hope that we 
would defeat these amendments that 
would undermine that idea, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I stand 
here today disappointed but not sur-
prised that my Democratic colleagues 
and their union boss allies want my 
home State of Georgia to look just like 
New York and California. 
This is made abundantly clear in the 
PRO Act where the bill outright bans 
State right-to-work laws. 
I can tell my colleagues one thing: 
Not on my watch. 
Georgia has been a proud right-to- 
work State since 1947, and it is one of 
the many reasons workers have pros-
pered. That is why I rise today to offer 
my straightforward amendment that 
strikes 
the 
ban 
on 
right-to-work 
States. 
No American should be forced to pay 
for representation and political activi-
ties that they do not agree with, and 
that is what will happen if we do not 
adopt my amendment. 
It is a no-brainer: workers should be 
in control of their earnings and how 
they spend it. Americans want choice. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
worker choice and vote ‘‘yes’’ on my 
amendment. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN.) 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, it is in-
teresting today listening to the debate. 
I didn’t hear anything about workers, 
trying to actually help workers get a 
better wage or better benefits or better 
safety in their workplace from people 
on the other side of the aisle. 
But what I have heard over and over 
and over again are Planned Parent-
hood, the Clinton Foundation, and Pro-
gressive Democrats of America which, 
by the way, Madam Speaker, don’t ap-
pear anywhere inside this bill today. 
I guess if you can’t talk about what 
you are going to do on behalf of work-
ers, you are going to talk about 
Planned Parenthood, Clinton Founda-
tion, and Progressive Democrats of 
America, which, by the way, I would

argue the free time they have given 
them this afternoon on national TV is 
probably more than the donations that 
actually came from union organiza-
tions. 
The bottom line is the other party 
here across the aisle has over and over 
said they want to rebrand themselves 
as the workers’ party, and yet they 
haven’t done a thing today to prove 
they care about workers. They have 
certainly proven for the bosses and cor-
porations that they are best buddies, 
BFFs forever, but on behalf of workers 
it is this side of the aisle that is doing 
all the heavy lifting. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. COMER). 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, my 
amendment protects the ability of em-
ployers to receive advice from an at-
torney or consultant regarding union-
ization without the attorney or con-
sultant having to disclose the relation-
ship to the Federal Government when 
the attorney or consultant will have no 
contact with the employer’s employ-
ees. 
Congress has no business forcing at-
torneys to report on an attorney-client 
relationship when the attorney will not 
be speaking with employees. Even the 
left-leaning American Bar Association 
opposed the Obama persuader rule, and 
I urge my colleagues to do the same by 
approving this amendment and pro-
tecting the First Amendment rights of 
employers. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
Madam Speaker, over 500 attorneys, 
including 244 Members of the American 
Bar Association, submitted a letter in 
support of the persuader rule. It does 
not require the disclosure of legal rep-
resentation but only of persuader ac-
tivities. 
Employers hire union avoidance per-
suaders to consult with them, accord-
ing to the Department of Labor in 2016, 
and between 71 and 87 percent of union 
elections persuaders produce antiunion 
literature and materials, write speech-
es 
and 
statements, 
and 
identify 
prounion employees for discipline or 
reward. The employees often do not 
know that their employer has retained 
such 
consultants 
in 
its 
campaign 
against the union. It is one of the 
things that they ought to have to dis-
close. 
So, Madam Speaker, I hope that we 
will defeat this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. WILSON). 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, amendment No. 19 
amends section 111 and replaces the 
text with the National Right to Work 
Act. Section 111 takes away the free-
doms of hardworking Americans and 
overrules State right-to-work laws of 
27 States enthusiastically enacted by 
voters. 
American workers should not be 
forced to pay fees to a labor organiza-
tion. American workers should not be 
forced to have a union represent them. 
American workers should not be forced 
to have their money go to political 
candidates they do not support. Amer-
ican workers deserve freedom, and this 
amendment delivers that. 
Right-to-work 
States 
like 
South 
Carolina have seen firsthand the job 
creation and robust economy that de-
velops when we expand freedom for 
jobs. It was crucial for South Carolina 
in our journey to become the leading 
manufacturer and exporter of tires 
with 
Michelin, 
Bridgestone, 
Conti-
nental, and Giti, while also being the 
largest exporter of cars in the United 
States with BMW, Volvo, and Mercedes 
vans. 
b 1445 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, this amendment would strike 
the bill’s provision that allows unions 
to collect a fair-share fee for services 
they are legally required to provide, 
and create, in its place, a national 
right-to-freeload scheme. 
This is a blatant attempt to under-
mine unions by making it harder to 
collect reasonable fees for the services 
they are required by law to perform 
equally for union members and non-
members alike. 
Let us understand where so-called 
right-to-work laws come from. They 
have nothing to do with a right to a 
job. Their history is rooted in Jim 
Crow-era laws designed specifically to 
prevent White and Black workers from 
organizing together in the same union. 
Last week, I was in Alabama, sup-
porting 
an 
overwhelmingly 
Black 
group of workers in their effort to form 
a union. I saw how difficult this was in 
a so-called right-to-work State. These 
laws are vestiges of a racist past, and it 
is time we reject them. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
chairman giving me some time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. 
WALBERG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
H.R. 842 codifies the one-sided Obama- 
era ambush election rule, which de-
prives employees of the necessary time 
to learn about the potential implica-
tions of refraining from or joining a 
union. 
My amendment ensures workers have 
appropriate time to learn the pros and 
cons of an enormously important deci-
sion affecting their careers, their fami-
lies, and their livelihoods. 
Unions often begin organizing cam-
paigns weeks or even months before 
employers are made aware of this ac-
tivity, creating a scenario in which 
workers are only hearing one side of 
the issue, like the other side of the 
Chamber today is trying to get across. 
Additionally, H.R. 842 imposes a com-
plex scheme of new regulations and 
penalties on employers of all sizes. 
Small 
businesses 
lacking 
internal 
human resources or legal departments 
would be most harmed by this ambush 
election. 
Providing appropriate time for work-
ers to hear both sides and inform them-
selves does not substantially change 
the organizing process. It merely cre-
ates a more informed electorate. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
my amendment. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
this amendment that I authored would 
prohibit labor organizations from using 
union dues and fees collected from 
workers for non-collective bargaining 
purposes without the written consent 
of the employee. No employee should 
be forced to subsidize political posi-
tions they disagree with at the cost of 
employment. 
According to the Center for Union 
Facts, 43 percent of union households 
voted Republican, yet 86 percent of the 
union political support went to Demo-
crat candidates in 2016. Clearly, there 
is a strong difference of opinion be-
tween union bosses and union members 
on the best pathway forward, but union 
bosses continue to spend their mem-
bers’ money with little accountability. 
Workers across Wisconsin and this 
country pay annual union dues to labor 
organizations in exchange for represen-
tation, not to line the pockets of the 
politicians. This amendment would 
stop unions from sending workers’ 
hard-earned money into a black hole 
and ensure that the voices of workers 
are being heard. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this amendment. Employees nation-
wide deserve to have a say in how their 
money is spent. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, my 
amendment 
maintains 
longstanding 
current law, which protects the ability 
of employers to continue to do business 
and provide for their customers during 
a labor relations dispute. 
One of the purposes of the National 
Labor Relations Act is to eliminate 
‘‘substantial obstructions to the free 
flow of commerce.’’ During the eco-
nomic chaos of the 1930s, Congress 
passed the NLRA, which struck a care-
ful balance by protecting workers’ abil-
ity to strike while not protecting the 
practice of intermittent strikes that 
create upheaval and uncertainty. 
The PRO Act aims to make it impos-
sible for employers to continue to do 
business in the event of a labor dispute, 
a death sentence for thousands of small 
businesses. 
Allowing 
intermittent 
strikes and banning permanent re-
placements would be devastating to

our economy, our global competitive-
ness, and the incentive to invest in 
American workers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to adopt this amendment and 
to prevent dangerous disruptions to 
our economy. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, this amendment seeks to 
hinder 
workers’ 
First 
Amendment 
right to assemble peacefully to better 
their workplace situation. 
No worker wants to go on strike. No 
worker wants to forgo a paycheck so 
they can walk a picket line, often in 
the frigid cold of winter or in the burn-
ing sun in the summer. Workers strike 
because they are left with no other op-
tion. 
The right to withhold labor is a core 
right, supposedly protected in our 
labor law, and the PRO Act would re-
store that fundamental right because, 
in practice, it has been gutted. 
I actually agree with the gentleman 
that what we need is to restore the bal-
ance that the National Labor Relations 
Act sought to create when it was 
passed in 1935. 
The things we are changing aren’t 
the National Labor Relations Act that 
was passed. It is not that balance. It is 
the ways that employees’ freedom to 
withhold their labor has been gutted in 
the interim by State and Federal 
courts and by this body. 
We need to restore workers’ freedom 
to withhold their labor in order to im-
prove their situation. That is all this 
bill does. Let’s get back to that bal-
ance. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, could I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina has 21⁄2 
minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from Virginia has 41⁄2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, the right to organize is appro-
priately protected in America, the 
right to organize fairly, honestly, and 
transparently. 
My amendment would provide great-
er fairness and transparency by prohib-
iting so-called neutrality agreements. 
These prevent an employer from saying 
anything negative about the union and 
ensure that workers only hear one side, 
the union boss’s side. 
Neutrality agreements often include 
card check in lieu of a secret ballot, 
permit unions access to company prop-
erty for organizational efforts, and give 
private employee contact information 
to the unions. The company, which was 
inevitably threatened with retaliatory 
consequences if they didn’t agree to 
the neutrality agreement, will often 
provide the unions with a captive audi-
ence on company time to present the 
prounion argument. 
Neutrality agreements are grounded 
in the same leftist view that companies 
are trying to take advantage of their 
employees. 
Neutrality 
agreements 
should be prohibited. Employees should 
be permitted to hear both sides, pro 
and con, regarding organizing, and 
then permitted to make informed deci-
sions by secret ballot. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support these amendments. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, this amendment is truly 
amazing to me as a longtime union or-
ganizer. It seeks to undermine the free-
dom of contract, the ability of employ-
ers and unions to agree on how to han-
dle a situation freely together. 
The shock of giving the employees’ 
addresses and other contact informa-
tion: That is required in every NLRB 
election, and it has been since the Ex-
celsior Underwear case many decades 
ago. 
The shock of letting the workers 
have access to hearing from the union 
on company time: The current law is 
that employers can force employees, on 
company time, to listen to antiunion 
propaganda the entire time. If you 
refuse to go, you could be fired. But if 
an organizer tries to step on the prem-
ises of the employer, they could be ar-
rested. 
I have been arrested for trying to 
talk to workers. It was on a public 
sidewalk, but the police said we were 
too close. Anyway, that was thrown 
out, as it should have been. We were 
exercising 
our 
First 
Amendment 
rights. 
In any event, this amendment is 
truly astounding in a capitalist soci-
ety. We need to let parties be free, and 
I urge rejection of the amendment. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman so 
much for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, at base, what we are 
talking about here is whether workers 
in this country are free to come to-
gether and form a union. All of these 
amendments are designed to under-
mine that right. 
Let’s get back to the basic concept of 
a free market for workers, where they, 
prounion or antiunion, can decide 
amongst 
themselves 
whether 
they 
want to form a union or not, and not 
have the person in the world who has 
the most power over them, their boss, 
who decides their wages and their 
hours, to pressure them, to force them 
to listen to things, to subject them to 
propaganda. 
The PRO Act simply creates freedom 
for workers to form unions, at long 
last, so that the workers who want to 
form a union can do so freely. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
Republican 
colleagues 
for 
offering 
these thoughtful amendments, which 
would protect the interests and rights 
of workers and employers alike. They 
negate some of the worst aspects of the 
PRO Act. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle said that the PRO Act gives 
workers the right to form a union. 
That right has been around since the 
1930s, Madam Speaker. Workers are al-
ready free to form a union, and Repub-
licans do nothing to try to stop that 
freedom. 
What the underlying bill does, how-
ever, is take away the freedom not to 
belong to a union. That is a funda-
mental freedom in this country, and we 
ought not to be taking that away from 
the American workers. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the Repub-
lican en bloc amendments and a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on the underlying bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, as a group, these 
amendments 
would 
erode 
workers’ 
rights, slow down elections, allow 
workers to freeload, or even prohibit 
employers from agreeing not to inter-
fere with the election. I would hope 
that we would defeat these amend-
ments, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 188, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 
1319, 
AMERICAN 
RESCUE 
PLAN 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 198 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 198 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to take from the 
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 1319) to provide 
for reconciliation pursuant to title II of S. 
Con. Res. 5, with the Senate amendment 
thereto, and to consider in the House, with-
out intervention of any point of order, a mo-
tion offered by the chair of the Committee 
on the Budget or his designee that the House 
concur in the Senate amendment. The Sen-
ate amendment and the motion shall be con-
sidered as read. The motion shall be debat-
able for two hours equally divided among 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on the 
Budget or their respective designees and the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means or their re-
spective designees. The previous question 
shall be considered as ordered on the motion 
to its adoption without intervening motion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON
LEE). The gentleman from 
Massachusetts is recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the distin-
guished gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BURGESS), pending which I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. During 
consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
today, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 198, 
providing for a motion to concur with 
the Senate amendment to H.R. 1319, 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 
The rule provides 2 hours of debate 
on the motion, equally divided and con-
trolled by the chairs and ranking mi-
nority members of the Committees on 
Budget and Ways and Means. 
Madam Speaker, a once-in-a-century 
pandemic brought us the need to act, 
and a Democratic Congress and a 
Democratic President have seized the 
moment, not as a chance to help big 
corporations or the already well-off, as 
those on the other side have done over 
and over again, but as an opportunity 
to invest in our workers, our students, 
our communities, and the very people 
who need help the most. 
More than 18 million Americans are 
receiving 
unemployment 
benefits 
today. Nearly 24 million adults are 
going hungry. Roughly 12 million chil-
dren are living in households with food 
insecurity. Up to 40 million people can-
not afford to pay rent and fear evic-
tion. Over 2 million women have been 
forced to leave the workforce. Eight of 
10 minority businesses are on the brink 
of closure. That is what COVID has 
wrought in America today. 
This is more than a Band-Aid; this is 
a lifeline, Madam Speaker. It will put 
more vaccines in arms, put more kids 
back safely in schools, put more money 
in people’s pockets, and put more peo-
ple back to work. It is hard to over-
state just how important this is. 
This bill, Madam Speaker, attacks 
inequality and poverty in ways we 
haven’t seen in a generation. This leg-
islation makes the biggest investments 
in our workers and our middle class 
that I have seen in my two-and-a-half 
decades of service here. 
Make no mistake, I am disappointed 
to see the cut in the unemployment in-
surance made over in the Senate, and 
we are going to keep fighting to raise 
the minimum wage so that no one who 
works full time lives in poverty. We are 
going to keep focusing on the hunger 
crisis in this country until we end it 
once and for all. These should be funda-
mental priorities of the wealthiest na-
tion on the planet. 
But let’s be clear. Today, we are on 
the doorstep of history. We are about 
to send the most sweeping and progres-
sive economic investment in modern 
times to the President of the United 
States: $1,400 in direct payments, a his-
toric child allowance, school infra-
structure, an expansion of the Afford-
able Care Act, student loan relief, bil-
lions in rental assistance, aid that will 
cut child poverty in half, and I could go 
on and on and on. 
Everything included in this final 
package is necessary to crush the virus 
and revitalize our economy. 
As I have noted, I have been in Con-
gress for more than 20 years, but this, 
Madam Speaker, this is among my 
proudest moments. 
I want to thank our distinguished 
Speaker, NANCY PELOSI, and my fellow 
committee chairs who worked so hard 
on this bill. I want to thank Budget 
Committee Chair YARMUTH and all of 
my colleagues here in the House for 
getting us to this point. 
Democrats on both sides of the Cap-
itol, together with the Biden adminis-
tration, have crafted something his-
toric. In 1 day, with a single vote in 
favor of this bill, we will change the 
lives of millions of Americans for the 
better. 
For all of our important work, day in 
and day out, we don’t get many 
chances like this. I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in voting for this 
rule and the underlying rescue plan. 
Let us rise and meet this moment, 
and let’s send this historic bill to the 
President’s desk for his signature. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule pro-
vides for consideration of the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 1319, the American 
Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 
First, the House considered the budg-
et resolution setting the budget rec-
onciliation instructions for this mas-
sive coronavirus relief bill. Then, the 
House considered and passed, on a par-
tisan basis, the budget resolution au-
thorizing a deficit increase of nearly $2 
trillion. After an all-night vote-a-rama 
in the Senate, the House will consider 
this package for the third time. 
Three times the House will have de-
bated and passed a partisan package, 
and only 9 percent is dedicated to actu-
ally crushing the coronavirus. This 
isn’t just disappointing; it is irrespon-
sible, and it is unrepresentative of the 
American people. 
Currently, Democrats only hold the 
majority by five Representatives. That 
means that the 211 Republicans, rep-
resenting nearly 150 million Ameri-
cans, have been shut out of this proc-
ess; 150 million Americans are not rep-
resented in the package before us 
today. 
Madam Speaker, we all want to pro-
vide 
the 
resources 
to 
successfully 
emerge on the other side of the pan-
demic. This bill does include funding 
for testing and vaccine deployment, as 
well as some economic support and aid 
to those who are unemployed or experi-
encing food shortages, but this support 
is not targeted toward those identified 
as most vulnerable. 
This bill includes $1,400 in economic 
stimulus payments to anyone making 
$75,000 a year or less, including those 
who may not have lost their jobs or ex-
perienced reduced employment. In ad-
dition, there is no mechanism to en-
sure that these payments go only to 
American citizens. 
Republicans were pleased that the in-
frastructure projects in California and 
New York, projects that had nothing to 
do with coronavirus relief, have been 
removed. We are glad of that. 
My Democratic colleagues may argue 
that these projects would have created 
jobs, but why then are Democrats also 
providing $125 billion to schools even if 
they remain closed? Teachers want to 
teach. Teachers want to be safely in 
their classrooms teaching. The Centers 
for Disease Control has confirmed that 
with appropriate safety precautions, 
the risk of coronavirus transmission in 
schools is minimal. In fact, many 
States are prioritizing teachers for vac-
cines. Madam Speaker, our State of 
Texas is doing so. Why are we paying 
schools to keep them home? 
This bill also provides $362 billion for 
State and local governments. The 
CARES Act, passed on March 27, al-
ready 
provided 
a 
$150 
billion 
Coronavirus Relief Fund to help local 
entities with lost revenue during the 
shutdowns. However, many local au-
thorities have chosen to keep their 
economies shut down, despite a drop in 
coronavirus cases and the effectiveness 
of 
safety 
measures 
like 
social 
distancing and mask-wearing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1165 
March 9, 2021 
Congress should not bail out State 
and local governments for mismanage-
ment that occurred prior to the pan-
demic. The total revenue loss of State 
and local governments during the pan-
demic is $7.6 billion. This bill provides 
over $219 billion, and it is available 
until expended. 
Let me say that again: It is available 
until expended. That is $200 billion 
more than the lost revenue due to the 
pandemic, the crisis which this bill is 
meant to target. 
b 1515 
This bill also provides $400 million 
for an emergency food and shelter pro-
gram, with $110 million set aside spe-
cifically for humanitarian relief to 
families and individuals encountered 
by Department of Homeland Security 
officials. 
Since his first day in office, Presi-
dent Biden has worked to overturn the 
advances achieved by the Trump ad-
ministration to limit border crossings 
by those undocumented, which is par-
ticularly concerning given that limited 
coronavirus testing is occurring along 
our Southern border. Just recently, 
over 100 individuals crossing without 
documentation tested positive for the 
coronavirus, but were subsequently re-
leased into the interior of the United 
States. 
We cannot allow the desires of for-
eign nationals to come before the needs 
of American citizens. We should pro-
vide testing and personal protective 
equipment to all encountered along our 
Southern border so that we can protect 
our frontline officials and protect 
American communities. 
These are only a few of the con-
cerning provisions included in this so- 
called relief package, but the most con-
cerning piece is that Republicans’ par-
ticipation in this process was ex-
tremely limited by Democrats. Biparti-
sanship is not unprecedented. We came 
together to pass prior coronavirus re-
lief bills. Literally, 1 year ago, March 
of last year, we passed three bipartisan 
coronavirus relief packages through 
the House and the Senate. And we can 
do so again. 
Why now are the Democrats deciding 
Republicans are not worthy, we are not 
worthy partners, and limiting the 
voices of our constituents? 
Why should only half of the Congress 
be allowed to participate in the mak-
ing of a law that will affect the entire 
country? 
Is only half of the American popu-
lation worth saving? 
Those are the questions being asked 
today. With that, I urge opposition to 
the rule. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD an article that 
appeared in Politico entitled, ‘‘ ‘Check 
Partisanship At the Door’: Biden finds 
GOP allies for rescue money.’’ 
[From Politico, Mar. 5, 2021] 
‘CHECK PARTISANSHIP AT THE DOOR’: BIDEN 
FINDS GOP ALLIES FOR RESCUE MONEY 
(By Kellie Mejdrich) 
Republicans in Congress attacking Presi-
dent Joe Biden’s plan to pour hundreds of 
billions of dollars in pandemic relief aid into 
local governments are facing resistance— 
from GOP-run states and cities. 
Republican mayors in Texas, Arizona, 
Florida and Oklahoma are among those 
backing Biden’s state and local government 
funding plan as part of the $1.9 trillion 
coronavirus aid bill that’s before the Senate, 
defying GOP lawmakers in Washington, who 
are broadly resisting the spending. 
‘‘In a crisis and an emergency, you check 
partisanship at the door, and you get 
through the crisis,’’ said John Giles, the Re-
publican mayor of Mesa, Ariz. ‘‘You can get 
back to playing politics when the crisis is 
over. And so this is one of those times.’’ 
The clash between local and national Re-
publicans is a rare public division in a party 
that has generally been united in opposition 
to policies being pushed by Biden and Demo-
crats in control of Congress. It’s a breach 
that Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
have gone out of their way to exploit as the 
coronavirus 
legislation 
enters 
the 
final 
stretch. 
Lawmakers 
including 
Senate 
Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Sens. 
Rick Scott and Marco Rubio of Florida, and 
Ted Cruz of Texas have been among the most 
vocal national Republicans in rejecting the 
aid, calling it a ‘‘bailout’’ of what they say 
are poorly run Democratic states and argu-
ing that state budgets fared much better 
than expected during the pandemic. They 
also say that a good chunk of the money 
doled out to the states by Congress last year 
remains unspent. 
McConnell slammed the relief package in 
his opening remarks Friday, calling it ‘‘an 
ideological spending spree packed with non- 
Covid-related policies’’ and panning the $350 
billion targeted for state governments as a 
‘‘massive cash bailout for mismanaged state 
and local governments.’’ 
But Giles and other mayors say their resi-
dents are locked in a struggle to fill pantries 
with food as municipal reserves and other 
dedicated funds are running dry. 
‘‘There has been an overwhelming backlash 
from our Republican congressmen and sen-
ators because of how much money is in this 
bill,’’ said Arlington, Texas, Mayor Jeff Wil-
liams. ‘‘For us, the reality is the need is very 
much here for cities.’’ 
Williams said that when he talks with his 
counterparts in Washington he tells them 
‘‘we have seen the great economists of our 
country all come together’’ in support of 
these additional funds for state and local 
governments. 
He also draws on comments by Federal Re-
serve Chair Jerome Powell. While Powell 
hasn’t taken a specific position on state aid 
or the coronavirus legislation itself, he has 
often spoken of the drag on the economy 
from the loss of more than a million state 
government jobs during the pandemic. 
Biden underlined the conflict within the 
party by inviting a bipartisan group of gov-
ernors and mayors to the White House last 
month to discuss local funding issues. Pelosi 
late last month said Republicans in Congress 
were choosing to ‘‘mock’’ the aid package de-
spite its broad support, citing a bipartisan 
letter signed by mayors across the country 
requesting more aid—including signatures 
from more than 30 Republicans. 
Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, a Republican 
who attended the White House meeting, told 
POLITICO, ‘‘We’re hoping that it doesn’t be-
come a partisan punching bag.’’ He said he 
hoped that ‘‘hearing from local officials that 
are on the ground, day in and day out, will 
be something that motivates elected officials 
from both parties’’ to support the funding. 
GOP lawmakers say that a surge in tax 
revenue for most states following last year’s 
massive aid packages makes more help un-
necessary now. But while the financial pic-
ture is brighter than many officials pro-
jected, some of the states hardest hit by the 
pandemic are represented by these law-
makers. 
A recent report from Moody’s Analytics 
showed that five of the 10 states with the 
biggest budget shortfalls are Louisiana, 
Oklahoma, Alaska, Florida and Kansas. They 
were among 19 states where Moody’s identi-
fied looming budget shortfalls even after ac-
counting for federal aid and local reserves. 
Ten of the 19 are represented by at least one 
GOP senator. 
‘‘It would be a dereliction of duty for me 
not to try to fight for $116 million that would 
allow us to restore our police, fire and other 
core services,’’ said Oklahoma City Mayor 
David Holt, a Republican. 
City and county leaders are amplifying 
calls for support because the new bill sets 
aside more than $100 billion for municipal 
and county governments—just over $120 bil-
lion in a ‘‘local fiscal recovery fund,’’ accord-
ing to the latest Senate version of the bill. 
So while just 38 cities got funding in the 
first round in March, the United States Con-
ference of Mayors estimates the new formula 
expands eligibility to 19,000 cities, towns and 
villages. That’s why more than 30 Repub-
lican mayors signed on to the letter in sup-
port of the package last month that Pelosi 
touted, with Giles, Holt, Suarez and Wil-
liams among them. 
Giles said the city of Mesa was lucky 
enough to get $90 million in the first round 
of aid, but added, ‘‘We could have turned in 
twice that much in receipts that were tied to 
virus relief; our expenses have gone higher.’’ 
‘‘Because we’re in the food bank business, 
we’re in the buying laptop computers for 
school business, we’re in the rent, utility 
business. We’re doing all of these things that 
we weren’t doing a year and a half ago,’’ he 
said. 
Even some Republican governors have pub-
licly vouched for the plan, including Asa 
Hutchinson of Arkansas and Larry Hogan of 
Maryland, citing the financial stakes ahead. 
Meanwhile, 22 Republican governors in a 
statement issued at the end of February 
criticized Biden’s funding plan—but only be-
cause their states will see a smaller share of 
the direct grant funding compared to what 
Congress sent them in March. 
‘‘The new stimulus proposal allocates aid 
based on a state’s unemployed population 
rather than its actual population, which 
punishes states that took a measured ap-
proach to the pandemic and entered the cri-
sis with healthy state budgets and strong 
economies,’’ read the statement, whose sig-
natories included Republican Governors Ron 
Desantis of Florida, Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma 
and Doug Ducey of Arizona. 
Many of Florida’s tourism-dependent cities 
have taken a financial beating, and the state 
faces a big shortfall for the coming budget 
year. Local media reported last month that 
the state deficit was estimated at $2 billion. 
Yet the same day that Miami’s Suarez 
traveled to Washington to discuss local fund-
ing with the president, Republican Sen. 
Scott slammed Biden’s proposed aid package 
for the states in an editorial, saying the 
money would be used to ‘‘bail out fiscally ir-
responsible governors in New York and Illi-
nois.’’ Rubio, Florida’s other Republican sen-
ator, has also spoken critically of more local 
aid, saying that some states ‘‘see this as the 
latest opportunity to get bailed out.’’

But even with better outcomes for states 
overall, state and local government employ-
ment still hasn’t recovered from the pan-
demic downturn. The latest Bureau of Labor 
Statistics data show that they are still down 
about 1.4 million jobs from a year ago—about 
1 million of which are in education. 
Teryn Zmuda, chief economist of the Na-
tional Association of Counties, said states do 
need the help. 
‘‘Local government specifically is down 1 
million of those 10 million jobs that the na-
tion is short right now,’’ Zmuda said. ‘‘So, 
aid to local governments will get those 1 
million workers back in the workforce.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
raise that because the only place where 
this bill isn’t bipartisan is here in 
Washington. Republican mayors and 
Republican Governors all across the 
country want this bill. Seventy percent 
of the American people want this bill. 
But here in Washington, my Repub-
lican friends think they know better 
than their constituents. They have 
what we call Potomac fever or they 
have gone Washington on their con-
stituents. 
The bottom line is people back home 
need help. People back home are strug-
gling, businesses back home have been 
devastated because of this pandemic. 
This is a bill designed to help the 
American people. 
Before I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut, we are about to be 
treated to a little bit of theatrics, and 
I understand that they want to delay 
the passage of this bill and bring up an 
alternative, a bill that they claim is 
going to help our schools but provides 
no new funding. 
What we are doing here, Madam 
Speaker, is we are not only providing 
funding to help our schools reopen safe-
ly, we are also providing money to help 
those who are unemployed, to help 
those who are hungry, to help our cit-
ies and towns that are on the verge of 
laying off first responders. 
In a moment, everybody in this 
House needs to stand and be counted; 
and on this side of the aisle—and I hope 
some of my Republican friends will 
join with us—we are going to stand 
with the people. We are going to stand 
with the people. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO), 
the 
distinguished 
chairwoman of the Committee on Ap-
propriations. 
Ms. 
DELAURO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
after a year of battling this pandemic, 
our communities are on the edge, and 
the American Rescue Plan is here. 
To the American public, help is on 
the way. 
It will put money directly into peo-
ple’s pockets. The $1,400 per person 
payment, the expansion of unemploy-
ment benefits will help people deal 
with increasing debt, paying rent, buy-
ing food, and paying healthcare bills. 
State and local funding is necessary to 
prevent our State and local govern-
ments from relying on tax increases to 
stay afloat; to keep first responders, 
frontline health workers, and other 
providers of vital services on the job. 
One of the provisions included in the 
American Rescue Plan that I am par-
ticularly proud of, that I have cham-
pioned for nearly two decades, is the 
expansion and the improvement of the 
child tax credit. In this plan, the credit 
increases from $2,000 to $3,000 for chil-
dren 6–17, with an additional $600 each 
for children under 6. Think of that. It 
is a new lifeline to the middle class, 
and it cuts child poverty nearly in half. 
Franklin Roosevelt lifted seniors out 
of poverty—90 percent of them—with 
Social Security. And with the stroke of 
a pen, President Biden is going to lift 
millions and millions of children out of 
poverty in this country. 
As families struggle to stay in their 
home, feed their families, purchase ne-
cessities, this plan provides for hard-
working Americans. It includes $12 bil-
lion in emergency food assistance, in-
cluding an extension of increased food 
stamps. The relief also provides $45 bil-
lion for rental and mortgage assist-
ance. 
It is time to make a bold investment 
in the health and the security of the 
American people. This is a watershed 
moment, an historic piece of legisla-
tion. We will vote for the American 
Rescue Plan with the determination to 
adequately meet the moment with 
strength, with action, and with hope.

change anyone’s vote at this point. I 
would just summarize it as advancing a 
socialist agenda by putting temporary 
bandages on old problems without fix-
ing them, at the expense of the middle 
class and the future of our children. 
Madam Speaker, I mainly just want-
ed to express my strong disappoint-
ment with how broken our legislative 
process is and how dysfunctional Con-
gress is. If we do not fix it soon and 
have some common sense, we are going 
to destroy our great Republic. We 
should be embarrassed to call ourselves 
policymakers. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, it 
is interesting that we just saw a parade 
of Republicans come before the micro-
phone and urge us to move on a bill, 
and they read the short title of the bill. 
But the real title of the bill, and let me 
read it to you, is: ‘‘To encourage local 
educational agencies to resume in-per-
son instruction at elementary and sec-
ondary schools.’’ That is what the bill 
does. 
Now, let me just say to my Repub-
lican friends, I don’t know if you go 
home and you don’t talk to principals, 
superintendents, teachers, parents, and 
students, but our schools don’t need 
encouragement. What they need are re-
sources to be able to reopen safely. 
This bill that you are talking about 
here doesn’t provide one additional 
cent to help schools reopen. Nothing. 
No money. No resources. Nothing. Give 
me a break. Come on. 
Madam Speaker, the bill that we are 
about to debate here will provide $130 
billion to help K–12 schools reopen safe-
ly. That is not encouragement. It is 
real resources to make it a reality. 
By the way, this bill also requires 
States to award K–12 funds to local 
school districts no later than 60 days 
after receipt and school districts to de-
velop plans to ensure that schools re-
turn to in-person learning. 
I could have saved you a lot of time 
and a lot of embarrassment. That was 
bad theater. It was terrible theater. 
Madam Speaker, people need help. 
We are trying to crush this virus, get 
this economy back on the right track, 
and reopen our schools, and this is 
what we get. Look, I hope everybody 
takes note of those who went before 
the mike to argue against this bill and 
for a symbolic bill that provides no re-
sources, because, at the end of the day, 
people need to know who was on their 
side in the middle of this crisis, who 
stood up and fought for them and pro-
vided much-needed Federal relief to 
our local communities and our schools. 
That was pathetic. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. ROSS), a distinguished new 
member of the Committee on Rules. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Let me 
remind Members to direct their com-
ments to the Chair. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, the 
American Rescue Plan will finally de-
liver needed aid to individuals, fami-
lies, 
workers, 
businesses, 
and 
healthcare systems. I am proud that 
this Congress has taken such swift ac-
tion to get this important work done. 
I want to highlight one part of the 
bill that would be life-changing for 
hundreds of thousands of people in my 
State. 
Sadly, North Carolina is one of only 
12 States that has not expanded Med-
icaid under the ACA. This failure has 
left over 600,000 low-income North 
Carolinians without healthcare. 
The American Rescue Plan provides 
an added incentive for States like mine 
to expand Medicaid. The bill offers a 5- 
point increase in the Federal funding 
match for Medicaid for 2 years to 
States that choose to expand the pro-
gram during this pandemic. This would 
bring North Carolina more than $2 bil-
lion in Federal healthcare coverage for 
our most vulnerable people and help 
our hardest-hit hospitals. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
our 
State 
des-
perately needs the relief provided in 
this bill. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to the time remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 221⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 18 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will amend 
the rule to immediately consider H.R. 
682, the Reopen Schools Act, intro-
duced by Mrs. HINSON from Iowa, to en-
sure that the $54.3 billion that Congress 
appropriated in December in order to 
help 
schools 
reopen 
is, 
in 
fact, 
prioritized to meet the expenses of ac-
tually being open for in-person learn-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of this 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. TENNEY), who is 
here to explain the amendment. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose the previous question 
and to offer an amendment to help our 
schools safely reopen their doors for in- 
person learning. 
Madam Speaker, millions of children 
around the Nation have been out of the 
classroom for the better part of a year. 
This has taken a serious toll not only 
on their learning and social develop-
ment but also on their working par-
ents, who have been forced to juggle 
home-schooling 
their 
children 
and 
working full-time jobs. 
The data is in, and it makes abun-
dantly clear that at-home learning is 
not a sufficient substitute for in-person 
education. One recent study found that 
children began to fall significantly be-
hind in math. The study concluded 
that it would take students in grades 5 
and 6 at least 12 weeks, on average, to 
catch up to where they were expected 
to be. 
Madam Speaker, the science is in, 
and it, too, makes abundantly clear 
that schools can reopen safely if the 
right precautions are taken. Common-
sense social-distancing measures sig-
nificantly reduce the spread of COVID– 
19 in schools and make the classroom a 
safe place for our students and our 
teachers. The CDC Director said last 
month that the science shows our 
schools can reopen safely even before 
every teacher is vaccinated. 
Madam Speaker, this is what the 
science tells us. Yet, despite these 
facts, too many children in my district 
and around the country are still not in 
the classroom. Students are losing out 
on a true, sound, basic education guar-
anteed them by the New York State 
Constitution, and parents are being 
forced to choose between going to work 
to earn a paycheck or staying home to 
teach their children. It is an impossible 
decision that no parent should be 
forced to make. 
In my home State of New York, Gov-
ernor Cuomo has said one thing and 
done another. The result has been con-
fusion across the State and a patch-
work of incoherent and conflicting 
policies. Governor Cuomo claims to 
support the science. Yet, it is March 
2021, and New York still does not have 
a statewide plan to reopen our schools. 
It is clear that he is putting special in-
terests before our students’ education. 
Sadly, we New Yorkers aren’t sur-
prised. Governor Cuomo has already 
lost credibility due to his unconscion-
able coverup of nursing home deaths. 
He failed to put our seniors first, and 
now he is failing to put our students 
first. We can and we must do better. 
Madam Speaker, under the American 
Rescue Plan that the House will con-
sider again later this week, nearly $130 
billion is set aside for schools. But if 
you read the fine print, 95 percent of 
that money won’t be spent until after 
2021 is over. If you keep reading, you 
realize that there is no requirement 
that the funding be used to reopen 
schools safely, something our Nation is 
desperately crying out for. 
The rescue plan fails to prioritize our 
students and does not do enough to re-
turn 
safely 
to 
in-person 
learning, 
which our students desperately need. 
b 1600 
If we defeat the previous question, we 
will move to immediately consider the 
Reopen Schools Act, which states that 
schools, which accept a portion of the 
COVID–19 funding, must reopen. In 
order to receive full funding, schools 
are required to allow at least 50 per-
cent of their students in the classroom, 
in person, at least 50 percent of the 
time. 
This is what New York families are 
requesting, and it is exactly what fami-
lies across the country are demanding 
from their leaders in Washington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1171 
March 9, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to yield to the gentlewoman 
if she could tell me how much money is 
in her bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
TENNEY) to ask how much money is in 
the gentlewoman’s bill. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, the 
money is coming from the American 
Rescue Act that the gentleman voted 
for, but what we are doing here is 
prioritizing the spending. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reclaim the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, here we have a Re-
publican colleagues coming to the floor 
basically advocating nothing. Their 
bill—read the long title again—is to en-
courage local educational agencies to 
resume in-person instruction at ele-
mentary and secondary schools. Not 
one new cent in money. 
Schools don’t need to be encouraged. 
They need the resources to be able to 
deal with issues like ventilation, to be 
able to make sure that the infrastruc-
ture is such that it is safe for students 
and teachers and others to come back 
to the schools. 
And my Republican friends, while 
they are coming here and trying to find 
ways to delay the American Rescue 
Act, they are going to vote against it. 
They are not advocating for one addi-
tional cent for vaccines. They are not 
advocating for any additional help for 
those who are unemployed, for small 
businesses and restaurants that are 
struggling. They don’t want any more 
resources to go to cities and towns. 
So I hope that we don’t see some of 
my Republican friends show up at an-
nouncements announcing money and 
resources for schools and cities and 
towns, for those who are struggling, 
trying to take credit for something 
that they voted against. 
Madam Speaker, I would, again, urge 
my colleagues on both sides to look at 
this for what it is. This is not about 
trying to help people. This is about a 
continuing effort to delay much-needed 
resources to our schools, to our strug-
gling families, and to our small busi-
nesses. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
LOIS FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the American Rescue Plan. 
Madam Speaker, I have been honored 
to be in public service in my State leg-
islature, as mayor of West Palm Beach, 
and now here in Congress. I can un-
equivocally say that this is the most 
important, impactful piece of legisla-
tion that I have ever had the honor to 
vote for. 
We all know that this past year has 
tested us like never before. The pan-
demic has destroyed lives and liveli-
hoods. It has disproportionately hurt 
women, especially women of color, who 
are already at an economic disadvan-
tage. The impacts have been dev-
astating. Women have lost 5.3 million 
jobs, 2 million of which are permanent 
losses. And that is not all. Women also 
make up the majority of our frontline 
workforce. In fact, Madam Speaker, we 
are calling this a ‘‘she’’ session. 
Schools close and the loss of acces-
sible childcare have only added to the 
crisis, but this bill will rescue women 
and their families with the relief they 
need. It will crush COVID–19, get our 
children safely back to school, and res-
cue the childcare industry. It is going 
to increase the child tax credit, taking 
half of our children in poverty out of 
poverty. It is going to get the vaccines 
into the arms of Americans. 
I will tell you this, Madam Speaker: 
My office is getting calls day after day, 
all day, from people who want these 
vaccines. 
This rescue package will put money 
directly into the pockets of working 
people and get people back to work. 
Women have shouldered so much of 
this pandemic. So it is time to extend 
the helping hand that they and their 
families need to get through this pan-
demic. 
I believe, Madam Speaker, that bet-
ter days are ahead with this rescue 
plan, and I urge my colleagues to pass 
it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
would just like to address the question 
that the gentleman from Massachu-
setts posed. 
What is allocated for this bill? 
$54.3 billion is going to be appro-
priated immediately. 
Madam Speaker, at this point, the 
bill that he is talking about has no 
money—only 5 percent until after 2021. 
We have students and parents and ev-
eryone coming to us, and they want to 
open their schools because the children 
are falling far behind. This is particu-
larly difficult in New York, where we 
have no plan in place and the Governor 
has failed to give us a plan, and our 
students are failing and we need to 
have our students back on track. 
That is all that we are asking for, is 
that this money be allocated now and 
not wait for only 5 percent to be allo-
cated until after 2021. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me just state for 
the record and respond to the gentle-
woman. The bill she is talking about is 
not an appropriations bill. Let’s be 
clear. Let’s make sure we are clear 
about what we are talking about here. 
This is not an appropriations bill. 
She is talking about money that was 
previously allocated in previous bills. 
The bill that my Republican friends are 
bringing forward allocates zero. It en-
courages schools to open up. 
Again, our schools don’t need encour-
agement. What they need are re-
sources. And if my friends would go 
home and listen to their superintend-
ents, to the principals, to the teachers, 
to the parents, to the students, they 
would understand how desperate the 
situation is. 
Now is the time for action, not more 
empty rhetoric, not more political the-
ater, not more words. People need re-
sources and they need it now. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), a distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the rule 
and underlying act, the American Res-
cue Plan Act. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has taken 
the lives of over 525,000 Americans. Our 
communities are struggling and our 
constituents are desperate for relief. 
Millions remain out of work, and as 
many as 12 million children are living 
in households where they don’t get 
enough to eat. 
We are grateful to have new leader-
ship in the White House and in the Sen-
ate. I look forward to passing legisla-
tion that will end the pandemic and 
open our economy and let America get 
back to work. The American Rescue 
Plan puts money directly in the hands 
of American people. 
The direct cash infusion will help 
millions of Americans pay their rent 
and keep the lights on at home. In ad-
dition to $1,400 worth of direct stim-
ulus payments for a large chunk of 
Americans, support for small busi-
nesses and restaurants, and an exten-
sion of unemployment insurance bene-
fits, the American Rescue Plan Act ex-
pands the child tax credit and the 
earned income tax credit to give fami-
lies the support they so desperately 
need. The child tax credit expansion 
alone will cut childhood poverty in 
half. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
passage of this act because, unlike the 
political charade that our colleagues 
just treated us to and wasting the time 
of the House and the American people, 
the American Rescue Plan Act will, 
number one, crush the virus; number 
two, get Americans back to work; and 
number three, actually help children 
get out from behind their screens and 
back in the classroom. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill and this 
rule. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to remind my 
Democrat colleagues across the aisle 
that I am from the State of Georgia, 
where, proudly, we are open. My son 
has been going in person to school this 
entire school year. As a matter of fact, 
he played football, where they had 
practices and games and parents got to 
attend and sit in the stadium. 
Children 
being 
kept 
home 
from 
school is about the worst thing that

you can possibly do. If you really want 
to do anything to help Americans, re-
open the schools, reopen America, and 
stop wasting more American tax dol-
lars. 
It is a complete lie to the American 
taxpayers that you are going to save 
the day with your $1.9 trillion spending 
bill, and you think you are going to 
save children. If you want to save chil-
dren, reopen the schools. 
The Biden administration is fine with 
having 100 percent open schools at the 
border for children who are coming 
into our country. 
Why are our children being forced to 
stay home in blue States and, many 
places, for no reason when their par-
ents pay the taxes? 
The best way to save America is re-
open. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Members are reminded to direct their 
remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, we all want schools 
to reopen, but we want them to reopen 
safely. There is such a thing called 
science that we need to respect, and we 
need to make sure that our schools are 
reopened safely. 
This is a deadly disease that has in-
vaded our country. We have all lost 
friends and loved ones to COVID–19. We 
lost a congressman-elect and a sitting 
Member of Congress on the Republican 
side to COVID. So to get up here and to 
talk like this is much ado about noth-
ing? Come on. What are my friends 
thinking? This is serious. 
Communities after communities all 
throughout this country are trying to 
find ways to reopen schools safely. 
Some of them are trying to invest in 
infrastructure for better ventilation to 
make sure that it is safe. Some are 
talking about additional school buses 
to be able to transport kids to and 
from school safely. They need re-
sources, not encouragement. 
Give me a break. How insulting to 
somebody watching this debate in any 
of our districts to hear Members of 
Congress get up and say, you know, 
you don’t need any help, you don’t need 
any resources, you don’t need any 
money to be able to help institute 
these changes so we can get kids back 
to school safely, but we are going to 
give you encouragement instead. 
Come on. We can do better than that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
just rise in opposition to this. 
Madam Speaker, I would say it is 
more disingenuous for this body to pre-
tend to tell the American people that 
we are doing something good for their 
children when, in fact, more money in 
this bill is going to help one Demo-
cratic district in California than is 
going to help all of the COVID relief ef-
forts. 
We have got our priorities very 
wrong. Our children are the future. 
And thank God that the Senate took 
the $15-an-hour minimum wage out of 
this because that was another nail in 
the coffin for our small business own-
ers. But to sit here and think we are 
doing something special for our con-
stituents, that is not really truthful. 
We are doing something special for 
Speaker PELOSI and a lot of others who 
want big bailouts for the Democratic 
cities. 
We can do better. We can do better 
for our students and for our families 
because those are the people in the 
trenches. Our future depends on it. Our 
students depend on it. We need to put 
our children back in school and we 
need to open our economy. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would encourage 
all of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to read the bill, to look at 
what is in this bill, and to look at the 
people who it will help. To claim some-
how that this is not going to help with 
reopening of schools or helping our 
small businesses or helping children 
struggling in poverty or helping people 
who are hungry shows that people are 
not reading the bill. 
This is a big, bold, appropriate re-
sponse to a horrific pandemic that has 
struck our country and struck the 
world. So we are acting, and it is the 
right thing to do. 
b 1615 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Mrs. HAYES). 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the American Rescue 
Plan. 
I was sitting in my office listening to 
debate, and I was thrilled to hear my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
speak up about reopening schools. 
These are words I have been waiting a 
year to hear. I immediately looked up 
H.R. 682 to read it, and I was so dis-
appointed that this bill offers no sup-
port, no assistance, and no funding for 
school reopenings. 
The American Rescue Plan, on the 
other hand, invests in helping K–12 
schools reopen safely and addresses 
learning loss in the classroom. 
The bill provides nearly $130 billion 
to help schools take the steps rec-
ommended by the CDC to ensure stu-
dents and educators can return to the 
classroom safely. 
This includes repairing ventilation 
systems, reducing class sizes, imple-
menting social distancing guidelines, 
purchasing PPE, and hiring support 
staff to address students’ well-being. 
Madam Speaker, as someone who has 
spent over a decade in the classroom, I 
can tell you that this is what every 
teacher in America is looking for, this 
is what every parent is looking for, and 
this is what is necessary to reopen 
schools safely—not just in commu-
nities that are largely Democrat but 
also in Republican communities. All of 
our children will benefit from the pro-
visions of this bill. 
The bill also sets aside 20 percent for 
long-term learning loss to get our kids 
from behind screens and back into the 
classroom by providing comprehensive 
after-school programs, summer learn-
ing programs, extended schooldays, re-
engaging students who have been ab-
sent from remote learning, and hiring 
counselors and nurses to care for stu-
dents’ emotional and physical well- 
being. 
I am thrilled to see part of my own 
legislation included in this bill, the 
Save Education Jobs Act, which will 
not only make sure that we are not 
laying off support staff and personnel 
to meet our students, but to make sure 
that there are not budget cuts in light 
of the catastrophic shortfalls that are 
expected as a result of this pandemic. 
I am so proud to be a part of a body 
that came up with this legislation that 
gives America’s schools exactly what 
they need, gives America’s children the 
support that is necessary, and reopens 
our economy by investing $130 billion. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, here are the facts: 
This bill is not going to reopen our 
economy. It is not going to reopen our 
schools or provide targeted relief to 
those who need it most. This is the 
most expensive bill in the history of 
the United States House of Representa-
tives, and it does not even prioritize 
the immediate needs of the American 
people. Rather than work for the 
American people, Democrats are fine 
working for their own future 2 years 
from now. That is really not the way it 
is supposed to be. We are supposed to 
be focused on the next generation, not 
the next election. I find this unaccept-
able. 
This is a $1.9 trillion partisan wish 
list that could ultimately increase the 
deficit $3 trillion without addressing 
the immediate needs of Americans who 
are trying to survive this pandemic. 
With $1 trillion of unspent funding— 
cash already in the till from previous 
bills—why is it so urgent to pass an-
other $2 trillion now without the rep-
resentation of literally one-half of the 
country? 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the 
rule, ‘‘no’’ on the underlying measure, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, we can talk and 
talk and talk and talk, and it might 
make us feel better, but it doesn’t do 
any good for the people we represent 
who are in desperate need. They are 
crying out for help. People are strug-
gling, people are hungry, and busi-
nesses are shutting down. 
My friends talk about reopening 
schools. They offer a measure that

would encourage our schools to be re-
opened but don’t offer one additional 
penny in resources to help them re-
open, which is so tone deaf and so dis-
connected from reality. People need 
help, and they need it now. 
Madam Speaker, let’s be really hon-
est here. My Republican friends do not 
have a problem spending $2 trillion. 
They spent that with their tax cut bill 
that benefited mostly people who are 
well-off and well-connected, and they 
were willing to spend that on COVID 
when Donald Trump was President. 
What they have a problem with is 
where this is going: to our workers, not 
the wealthy; and to our communities, 
not corporations. That is the funda-
mental difference in how we govern. 
Democrats govern for the people. 
Right 
now 
people 
are 
hurting, 
Madam Speaker. An overwhelming ma-
jority of the American people across all 
party lines and divisions support the 
American Rescue Plan. We have seen 
that in poll after poll after poll. My Re-
publican friends just say that they are 
uninformed, including their Republican 
mayors 
and 
Republican 
Governors. 
How insulting. 
This bill will put more vaccines in 
arms. It will put our kids back to 
school safely. It will put food on dinner 
tables and put workers back in jobs. 
This pandemic is an all-hands-on- 
deck moment. After weeks and weeks 
of work, Congress doesn’t have a mo-
ment to spare. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
these historic investments in our Na-
tion. We have told our neighbors and 
communities that help is on the way. 
Let’s deliver on that promise. 
I am proud to be on the House floor 
today. I am proud to speak in favor of 
the American Rescue Plan. And I am 
proud to vote in favor of this impor-
tant piece of legislation. This will help 
save lives and will help save our econ-
omy. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 198 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 682) to encourage local educational 
agencies to resume in-person instruction at 
elementary and secondary schools, and for 
other purposes. The first reading of the bill 
shall be dispensed with. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
General debate shall be confined to the bill 
and shall not exceed one hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. After general debate 
the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the five-minute rule. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. When the committee rises and re-
ports the bill back to the House with a rec-
ommendation that the bill do pass, the pre-
vious question shall be considered as ordered 
on the bill and amendments thereto to final 
passage without intervening motion except 
one motion to recommit. If the Committee 
of the Whole rises and reports that it has 
come to no resolution on the bill, then on 
the next legislative day the House shall, im-
mediately after the third daily order of busi-
ness under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into 
the Committee of the Whole for further con-
sideration of the bill. 
SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 682. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the

TEXANS NEED TO DO WHAT IS 
RIGHT TO SAVE LIVES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
over 500,000 dead; 44,000 or more dead in 
the State of Texas. 
The State of Texas, throughout the 
entire pandemic, remained one of the 
top hot spots of the Nation. They start-
ed testing late. We started vaccines 
and still have not reached a certain 
percentage, but yet, tomorrow, on 
March 10, 2021, our Governor has an-
nounced that there will be no mask 
mandate, and there will be no restric-
tions on any form of entertainment, 
restaurants, any large gatherings. 
Tomorrow, March 10, the people of 
Texas get a death notice. I am asking 
my friends in Texas to wear your 
masks, socially distance, wash your

can, but I am letting you know that 
Texas has all five of the variants of 
COVID–19. They have long-haulers in 
Texas, people who have continued to 
have COVID–19. 
To save lives, I am asking my fellow 
Texans—as I know President Bush al-
ways used to call us, his ‘‘fellow Tex-
ans’’—to wear your masks, wash your 
hands, socially distance to save lives. 
Let’s ignore wrong-headed advice and 
do what is right to save lives.

HONORING KERRY MCDANIEL 
(Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, sadly, 
Kerry McDaniel passed away in Feb-
ruary at just 65 years of age from 
COVID–19 complications. 
Kerry was described as ‘‘can’t be re-
placed,’’ ‘‘top-notch in every regard,’’ 
and ‘‘an exemplary model of generosity 
and selflessness.’’ 
Kerry loved serving his community 
and 
did 
so 
in 
various 
positions 
throughout the years. For almost three 
decades, Kerry worked for the Ken-
tucky Department for Environmental 
Protection, and most recently, he was 
the Hart County Emergency Manage-
ment Director and Solid Waste Coordi-
nator. 
As a frontline responder, he worked 
hard to obtain personal protective 
equipment and protect Hart County 
from COVID–19. Throughout the coun-
ty, Kerry was known for his service and 
generosity to others. 
Kerry is survived by his dear wife, 
Vicki; his son, Curtis; his daughter-in- 
law, Tara; his grandson, Briar Allen, 
and many other family members he 
loved so dearly. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have 
known Kerry; he was an exemplary cit-
izen. Kerry was a great friend, and he 
will be missed by all who knew him.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN WILL 
MAKE ECONOMY STRONGER 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, for the 
one in eight Americans who will go to 
bed hungry tonight; for the 60 million 
Americans out of work and the 40 mil-
lion who fear they might be evicted to-
morrow; for the 2.3 million women, a 
million mothers, who have left the 
workforce, the American Rescue Plan 
is for you. 
It will put money directly in your 
pockets; expand access to affordable 
healthcare and childcare; extend unem-
ployment insurance and housing and 
nutrition assistance; and support 27 
million children with an expanded 
child tax credit. 
Mr. Speaker, for the 1.4 million pub-
lic-sector employees who are out of 
work—our firefighters, our teachers, 
our frontline public health workers, 
our first responders—we are going to 
provide $350 billion for States and lo-
calities, including $13.7 billion for my 
State of Illinois, to get you back to 
work, too. 
We 
can’t 
fix 
everything. 
524,000 
American lives lost to COVID are never 
coming back. But tomorrow, when we 
vote to pass the American Rescue Plan, 
we will honor their memory. We will 
make things a little easier for their 
loved ones. We will get their kids back 
in school safely, their family busi-
nesses back in the black, cut child pov-
erty in half, create 4 million new jobs. 
Most importantly, we will emerge 
from this crisis with an economy that 
is stronger, more equitable, and poised 
for growth for years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my col-
leagues in the House and Senate who 
made this possible. Let’s get this done. 
f 
PRO ACT MUST HAVE 
EXEMPTIONS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I am 
from California, and almost 2 years 
ago, the State passed a bill known as 
AB–5, where all workers would be pre-
sumed as employees unless the worker 
can show that they satisfy all three 
prongs of what is known as the ABC 
test. 
It went into effect in January 2020, 
and it had quite a few exemptions in 
it—barbers, 
musicians, 
translators, 
home inspectors, golf caddies, things 
like that. But after the bill passed, 
flaws were found in it. They had to go 
back and legislate again to add news-
papers. They had to go back and extend 
the time for others for when it would 
kick in. 
So, what is happening? Here in this 
House, we are on H.R. 842. Now, I had 
an amendment that would provide for 
some of those exemptions. This pro-
vides for zero exemptions for this re-
quirement that all would be presumed 
as employees. 
We are going to go ahead and do ac-
tually worse than the State of Cali-
fornia, passing the PRO Act without 
the exemptions. 
Government should be here to foster 
economic growth, not restrict it. The 
PRO Act would kill growth, squash in-
novation in the gig economy and the 
American economy. 
Why are we going backward here 
when we can learn from California’s 
mistake? 
f 
SUPPORTING WORKERS BY 
SUPPORTING UNIONS 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of our Nation’s greatest asset, our 
workers, 
our 
essential 
workers— 
nurses, teachers, mail carriers, trans-
portation, sanitation, and food indus-
try workers, among so many others— 
who have lifted the Nation with their 
sacrifice and bravery. 
Just as they have supported us, we 
must 
support 
them 
by 
supporting 
unions. Attacks on unions, and a series 
of significant actions by the former ad-
ministration, have weakened worker 
protections and, in turn, destroyed the 
middle class. 
That is why I was proud to just vote 
to pass the Protecting the Right to Or-
ganize Act, the most significant up-
grade 
for 
workers’ 
collective 
bar-
gaining rights in more than 80 years. 
If we are to fully recover from this 
deadly pandemic and build back better, 
we must invest in and protect the 
rights of our workers to unionize. 
American workers and their families 
are depending on us. 
f 
ENTREPRENEURS WILL BE 
HARMED BY PRO ACT 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I fear 
that H.R. 842 is going to have serious 
long-term 
consequences 
for 
entrepreneurialism here in America. 
Mr. Speaker, I started a company 30 
years ago out of my college dorm room 
at Caltech, and I grew it the way that 
most small businesses are grown in 
America. I grew it organically. That 
means that when I had a little bit more 
business than I, myself, could do, I con-
tracted that business out to other peo-
ple who could do that business for me. 
Mr. Speaker, under this bill, that 
practice will be illegal because it vio-
lates the so-called B pillar of the bill 
that prohibits any contracting that is 
related to the core business that a 
company engages. 
Mr. Speaker, if H.R. 842 had been the 
law of the land, I would not have been 
able to start my company, and the 
hundreds of jobs that we have created 
would not have been created here. But 
they will be created elsewhere, in other 
countries, with more sane and less re-
strictive laws. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
H.R. 842. 
f 
GETTING BACK ON TRACK WITH 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, 1 year 
ago, almost to this very day, is the day 
when COVID–19 was officially declared 
a pandemic. One year ago, we didn’t 
know that this pandemic would infect 
millions of Americans or kill thou-
sands of Texans in my home State and 
hurt so many disadvantaged commu-
nities. 
But after a year of darkness, we are 
finally seeing the light because the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1180 
March 9, 2021 
House will pass, tomorrow, the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, a comprehensive 
plan that the Biden-Harris administra-
tion and our Democrat-led House and 
Senate has crafted which will give con-
stituents in the district that I rep-
resent, and all Americans, the chance 
for some relief. 
Our plan will help crush the COVID– 
19 virus and get the economy moving 
again by getting vaccines into arms 
across the country. Because in places 
like my home State of Texas, where 
Greg Abbott, who is the Governor, is 
prematurely lifting COVID–19 restric-
tions, the best thing we can do to com-
bat a potential surge against the virus 
is to make sure that everybody has a 
vaccine. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I am a 
proud supporter and will vote for the 
American Rescue Plan tomorrow, be-
cause we need a bold solution like this 
one for our country and economy to 
get back on the right track and to get 
back to normal.

DELIVERING FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE 
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as a Michigander as my home 
State is recognizing 1 year from the ar-
rival of our first cases of COVID–19. 
I rise today to say that more help is 
on the way, that today we are deliv-
ering for the American people and de-
livering for my home State of Michi-
gan. 
I rise today to say that we passed the 
PRO Act to stand up for hardworking 
Michiganders, that we will get rid of 
right-to-work, that people are at the 
heart of what we do here in this Cham-
ber, and that by prioritizing the legis-
lation that stands up for hardworking 
Americans, we are delivering for them. 
Tomorrow, we will pass the Butch 
Lewis Act. We will right the pensions 
of almost a million Americans. That is 
what we came here to do. That is what 
unity is.

DEMOCRATS’ SPENDING BILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Tennessee 
(Mr. KUSTOFF), my friend, who had 
someone that was very special in his 
life that he wanted to talk about. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DREW 
DANIEL 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend and colleague from Arizona 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand here tonight 
saddened because a little over a year 
ago, I took to the House floor to pay 
tribute to a dear friend, Peggy Daniel 
of west Tennessee, who had recently 
passed away. 
Today, we honor the life of her son 
and my friend, Drew Daniel, who left 
us way too soon. Drew passed away last 
week. He was a native of west Ten-
nessee, the son of my friends, Peggy 
and Jimmy Daniel. 
Drew moved to Shelby County in the 
early 1990s for college, and he received 
his 
bachelor’s 
degree 
in 
political 
science from the University of Mem-
phis, where he then later achieved a 
master’s degree in public administra-
tion. Drew interned in the House of 
Representatives for then-Congressman 
Don Sundquist, who also was a close 
and dear friend of Drew’s parents. 
Drew loved to volunteer for his com-
munity, and he was an active member 
of the Boy Scouts of America, the Mid-
town Rotary Club, and Memphis City 
Beautiful Commission. 
Drew was also extremely active in 
the Shelby County Republican Party 
and the Tennessee Republican Party. 
He had served as the Shelby County 
Young Republican chair and was an 
elected member of the Tennessee State 
executive committee of the Tennessee 
Republican Party. In 2019, Drew was se-
lected as a Tennessee Republican Party 
Statesman of the year. 
Drew was also a longtime valued em-
ployee for David Lenoir in the Shelby 
County Trustee’s Office and then an 
agent for New York Life. 
Without a doubt, Drew was a dedi-
cated leader with a heart for public 
service and also for volunteerism. I 
really don’t know many people who 
were more passionate about politics or 
their community than Drew Daniel. 
I have so many memories, seeing 
Drew and Peggy cheering on the Mem-
phis Tigers in the Liberty Bowl and the 
FedEx Forum. Truly, as good of a per-
son as Drew was, he was a great son to 
his parents and a terrific brother to 
Mike and Melanie. 
We are all better because of Drew, 
and he will be deeply missed by every-
one. Roberta and I extend our deepest 
sympathies to his brother, Mike, and 
his sister, Melanie. Rest in peace, 
Drew. 
Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
when we have someone special in our 
districts like that, sometimes with the 
chaos around here, it is hard finding 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the things I 
wanted to do this evening is to start to 
build on a theme that I have done in 
the past, and I hope to be able to do 
over the coming months. But it is a lit-
tle difficult right now because, let’s be 
honest, the House is spending money at 
a pace where it is really hard for the 
Joint Economic Committee and even 
my own staff to try to keep up. 
We are going to talk about what is 
going on, a couple of things I really 
want us to start to put in the RECORD, 
talk about, and get our heads around. 
I have an absolute fixation of a moral 
obligation to the working poor in this 
country and an understanding of what 
happened in 2018 and 2019 when the 
working poor, the value of their labor— 
and understand, for many of us who 
have 
graduate 
degrees 
and 
those 
things, who can work behind a com-
puter, great. Our skill set is what we 
are selling. 
For much of the workforce, if you 
didn’t finish high school or you have 
moderate skill sets, your labor is your 
value. What is going on here right now 
is almost a type of economic violence 
to that labor value. 
Yet, I am not sure my brothers and 
sisters on the other side even see it. So, 
let’s first delve into a little bit of what 
is going on at the border. Do under-
stand, one of the things we see in the 
math from 2018 and 2019, when the 
working poor got dramatically less 
poor, the first 2 years in modern times 
where income inequality shrank—not 
because rich people got less rich, but 
because poor people made money—the 
value of their labor increased because 
they weren’t competing with armies of 
other unskilled labor. 
Mr. Speaker, if we are going to be 
honest around here and say we care 
about the poor, that we care about the 
working poor, don’t you see the eco-
nomic violence we are allowing to hap-
pen at the border, making our folks 
have 
to 
compete 
with 
floods 
of 
moderate- to low-skilled immigrants? I 
know it is an uncomfortable conversa-
tion, but we need to see it in the total-
ity of the people we claim we care 
about. 
Then, the other day, I made a mis-
take on one of the hard-left-leaning 
cable television shows. They were try-
ing to compare what we did in tax re-
form to the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion 
spending bill and said: Well, they are 
both $1.9 trillion. But look here, this 
went to tax cuts, where this goes to 
spending. Isn’t the spending so much 
more wonderful? 
b 2115 
Once again, I need my brothers and 
sisters on the left to go back to school 
and spend a moment paying attention 
in their economics class. The elegance 
of the tax reform was that it made the 
value of workers’ labor more valuable 
because the economy grew. We specifi-
cally made it so businesses would take 
part of that tax reform and put it into 
things that made their businesses more 
productive, making it so you can pay 
people more. 
Remember, individuals’ wages go up 
on two things, inflation and produc-
tivity. It is one of the reasons in 2018 
and 2019 we had the fastest wage 
growth of workers, particularly the 
working poor in modern history. 
So what is the Democrat solution to 
help these populations? 
We are going to send them a check. 
And maybe part of that is good. There 
are people out there who are really suf-
fering and hurting. 
But what do we do next year?

one’s labor become more valuable is

that value sets; and then the next year, 
it builds on it; and the next year, it 
builds on it; and after a little while, 
they are no longer in the working poor. 
We are going to do a patch that is 
going to load another $1.9 trillion of 
debt. And over the decade, the amount 
of interest we are going to pay on that 
is not $1.9 trillion, but it is probably 
$1.6 trillion. That is one of the things 
we are going to talk about just real 
quickly here. 
I cannot produce these boards fast 
enough to keep up with the Democrats’ 
spending agenda right now. The CBO 
can’t produce the data fast enough. 
The Joint Economic Committee can’t 
produce the data fast enough to even 
get our heads around it. 
So this slide here is from September. 
Understand, the numbers are much 
uglier today. It was a simple point in 
functioning 8 budget years. In Sep-
tember, we were saying each family 
would have $230,000 of Federal debt ap-
plied to their household, the amount of 
debt. So that is every household. That 
is not tax-paying households; that is 
every household. Today, my back-of- 
the-napkin math is about a quarter of 
a million dollars in 8 years for every 
family in America. We are spending 
that fast. 
Being the father of a 5-year-old, I see 
the economic violence being done by 
the left here to her future, to the kids’ 
futures. I am looking for the day I have 
to sit her down and apologize that she 
is not going to live as well as I have 
lived because of what we allowed to 
happen here today. 
Let’s have a quick education. Let’s 
walk through real quick where the 
money goes. Social Security, about $1 
trillion. Remember, this is based on 
last year’s numbers. Today, these num-
bers have ballooned again. Defense, 724. 
Medicare, right now, I believe this year 
has now surpassed defense. So my last 
bit of math was Medicare was now 
starting to pass defense in total spend-
ing. Health, that is ObamaCare, that is 
all the other entitlements. 
But if you actually look at the slide, 
Social Security, Medicare, the other 
health entitlements, income security, 
interest, veterans. It is the vast major-
ity of spending. Yet you look at these 
tiny little slices, like, this little slice 
over here is foreign aid. 
Yet how often do the politicians get 
behind these microphones and say, 
well, if we would cut foreign aid? 
If this were a clock, I think foreign 
aid would cover about 14 minutes of 
spending in an entire day, in a 24-hour 
day. 
If we don’t get our heads around the 
fact that the Medicare, the health enti-
tlements, the net interest are the 
things now which will drive our debt, I 
am terrified of what is coming. Be-
cause, understand, it is really hard to 
say, but our demographics, we are get-
ting older very quickly as a society. If 
you look at the 30-year curve, we are a 
country that doesn’t make it. We are 
so buried in debt. 
And 
the 
economic 
violence 
the 
Democrats are committing tomorrow 
by adding another $1.9 trillion on top of 
the trillion that is already sitting in 
the bank and hasn’t been expended, 
that we have done this last year, are 
we thinking about anything other than 
our next reelection? 
How about thinking about my 5-year- 
old daughter and what her economic 
future is. How about everyone else’s 
economic future. 
I am going to try to do a couple of 
these quickly. We were trying to use 
CBO’s numbers. The problem is, they 
haven’t updated them yet on how fast 
we are spending. But what is so impor-
tant here in functionally 8 budget 
years—now, this slide looks a little dif-
ferent than your typical debt slide be-
cause we calculate it on debt that is 
sold to the public, not internal debt. 
Remember, when you look at U.S. 
sovereign debts, there are, sort of, two 
pies. There is stuff where we reach into 
the Social Security fund, grab that 
money, and borrow it, and put IOUs in 
it. 
The other debt that is economically 
dangerous—because 
when 
interest 
rates move, it causes a problem—we 
are going to talk about that real quick-
ly. This is debt sold to the public. It 
might be China; it might be Japan; it 
might be your grandma’s pension. In 
about 8 years, debt held by the public 
will double from where we were last 
year. Understand how fast. 
Now, a lot of this, believe it or not, 
even though some of the crazy spend-
ing we are doing right now is the demo-
graphics, demographics aren’t Repub-
lican and Democrat. It is just math 
that we don’t like to talk about. But 
the fact of the matter is that we have 
made promises, and the money that we 
collected for those promises, we have 
already spent and we are going to have 
to borrow. 
So understand the fragility—I love 
that word, fragility—we have given 
ourselves. Interest rates in January 
were under 1 percent. They were actu-
ally at .91. Today, when the market 
closed, I think it was, 1.54, something 
in that nature. Most of us go, big deal, 
this still is historically really, really, 
really cheap. Except, think about it. 
Just that little movement in the last 2 
months is about $600 billion over the 
next 10 years. Just that little move-
ment, $600 billion of interest. 
What are we buying with that inter-
est? 
Nothing. 
And there are a lot of economists out 
there who think, because we are spend-
ing at such a fast rate, we are going to 
start to chase our tail. Part of that 
may be because the economy actually 
is getting healthier. One of the great 
intense ironies is we are about to spend 
$1.9 trillion, pretend it is a stimulus— 
even though a bunch of that money 
doesn’t get spent for a year, 2 years, a 
little bit, 3 years from now—claim it is 
a stimulus, pile it on as debt that is 
going to cost $2.6 trillion with financ-
ing costs added to it. Only a sliver of it 
is actually economic stimulus. And be-
cause we are going to the markets to 
finance every dime of it, we are helping 
drive up our own interest rates. Mean-
ing, we are going to chase our tail eco-
nomically. 
Do you understand? 
Remember the pie chart from before, 
that interest right now. We expect, 
within about a decade, interest may be 
the second most expensive thing in our 
budget. You will be seeing Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, and then interest right 
up there, and that is going to consume 
everything. There functionally will be 
no more money left. 
I know I am getting a little thick, 
but to try to drive this home, the 
changes in debt that happen from 
where the CBO was projecting back in 
January to some of the numbers we are 
seeing right now. 
So just for the fun of it—I know this 
is hard to read. We just did a calcula-
tion and said, hey—the CBO basically 
said, hey, interest rates are going to go 
up a quarter percent. Think of it as 25 
basis points. But if we went up 100 basis 
points in interest, over the 10 years of 
financing that, we are basically look-
ing at—what is that—another $3.5 tril-
lion of financing costs. 
So, yes, you get to say we are spend-
ing that $1.9 trillion today, but do you 
understand the total cost of that? 
So it is not just the cost of the legis-
lation. It is the cascade effect that you 
are creating to the economy; where 
that family who wants to buy their 
first home, you just raised their mort-
gage interest rates. 
But on a national basis, this year we 
will finance probably about $10 trillion. 
My quick estimate is about $7 trillion 
on just our bonds that are rolling off, 
that we have to refinance because we 
have no cash to pay for them. So they 
get reset at the new interest rates. 
Then we have our typical spending. 
So there goes another trillion dollars, 
plus the trillion we authorized back in 
December and last year, and now an-
other couple trillion dollars. So an-
other four on top of that seven, and 
you start to look at over $10 trillion of 
new issue or refinancing coming to 
market of U.S. sovereign debt. 
What did we just do to our interest 
rates, the world interest rates, the 
value of money? 
And this comes back to my earlier 
point. We talk about what is happening 
in income inequality, the working 
poor. Those of us who have stocks or 
have a house or have assets, when you 
do this type of monetization of debt, 
when it requires the Federal Reserve to 
keep pumping in—today, we have 20 
percent more cash floating around in 
our economy than we had a year ago. 
People who are wealthy own things. 
They make a lot of money because 
their assets get more and more valu-
able. 
The working poor who don’t own a 
house, they don’t own stocks, they 
don’t have a bond, they don’t have a

pension. What they have, they get 
crushed. That is what we are doing to 
the working poor here. 
Please, someone, buy an economic 
book for my Democrat brothers and 
sisters to understand. There is going to 
be a lot of singing and happy in a cou-
ple months when they get the check. 
And next year, when they realize they 
are being crushed, who will step up and 
actually take blame, saying, we could 
have done things that would have 
grown the economy, grown your future 
income, made so the working poor ac-
tually had a future? 
Instead, we are going to flood the 
market with competing labor. We are 
going to devalue any asset you have, 
and we are going to make it so you can 
never afford to get out of the quartile 
where you are trapped. And this is 
what leftist policies do to poor people. 
So, look, this is a theme. We are 
going to build on it and we are going to 
bring in more and more data and facts 
and see if we can turn around some of 
the heads here to say it is not enough 
to talk that we care. It is when you ac-
tually can stand up and say Republican 
policies in 2018 and 2019, before the 
virus, we actually made a difference. 
We are the party that actually closed 
income inequality. We are the party 
that actually made the working poor 
less poor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO 
KEEP AND BEAR ARMS SHALL 
NOT BE INFRINGED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS) is recognized until 10 
p.m. as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Arizona for his very in-
formative speech here about our com-
ing, looming economic issues. 
Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 weeks, the 
majority 
has 
attacked 
the 
First 
Amendment; and now they are attack-
ing the Second Amendment. The Sec-
ond Amendment clearly states the 
right of the people to keep and bear 
arms shall not be infringed. And as 
Justice Scalia noted in his decision in 
Heller, the Second Amendment does 
not give Americans a right; it protects 
a preexisting right. Hence, the phrase, 
‘‘Shall not be infringed.’’ 
b 2130 
Our theme for the next 30 minutes 
will be about H.R. 8 and the damage it 
will do to the Second Amendment 
which is, as Justice Scalia noted, a pre-
existing right. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Arizona for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, we are all concerned 
with this bill, H.R. 8. And the reality 
is, the big money donors and powerful 
special interest groups behind the 
Democratic Party for a long time have 
sought to undermine, restrict, and even 
eliminate 
the 
Second 
Amendment 
rights of Americans. 
With the Democratic Party now call-
ing the shots here in Washington, quite 
frankly, the majority party is not even 
trying to hide their true agenda. 
Masquerading as supposedly good- 
faith proposals to end gun violence, 
what they are really putting in place 
are the stepping-stones to creating a 
national firearm registry and eventu-
ally even confiscating firearms. 
H.R. 8 is being considered later this 
week, and it would implement a uni-
versal background check system. The 
majority claims that this is an obvious 
solution to gun violence, but that is 
simply not the case at all. 
Gun violence in America is complex, 
and so are the solutions. But the over-
whelming majority of criminals would 
not be stopped by H.R. 8 whatsoever. In 
fact, the Justice Department itself, by 
its own data, says that 75 percent of 
criminals in prison who possessed a 
firearm obtained it through theft, the 
black market, or family and friends. 
Secondly, we know that the vast ma-
jority of mass shooters would have 
been able to pass background checks. 
This bill does not in any way end gun 
violence. 
But what it does do is create a na-
tional gun registry that will eventually 
be used against law-abiding Americans. 
Without a permanent database of 
who owns a firearm, the Federal Gov-
ernment would not be able to deter-
mine whether a private firearm trans-
fer took place with the required back-
ground check. 
So that brings to us the real aim of 
this bill, H.R. 8. It paves the way for 
this database to be used at a later date 
in a national gun confiscation pro-
gram. 
Mr. Speaker, don’t take my word for 
it. 
Even President Biden, himself, in Au-
gust 2019, said that he does support 
confiscating assault weapons which he 
would consider AR–15 style. 
So, Mr. Speaker, the threat is real. 
We are in a major fight for those who 
are trying to dismantle and eliminate 
the Second Amendment. We are not 
blowing smoke here. H.R. 8 is a mas-
sive move in that direction, and we 
stand here tonight to say: No, we are 
not going to allow that to happen on 
our watch. 
We have to be vigilant, and we have 
to stand guard for our freedoms. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend, the gentleman from Arizona, for 
yielding to me. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
my friend from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. 
DAVIDSON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. And 
I thank this body for still continuing 
the tradition of this opportunity to 
speak and have our voices heard, even 
though we are in the minority. 
We don’t control the floor, we can’t 
put our bills on the agenda to have a 
debate, and often we can’t even get an 
amendment considered on the bills. 
The Rules Committee strips out any-
thing that would materially change a 
bill. Sadly, that has been a bipartisan 
approach to governing in this body. 
That is not a functioning legislature 
when those kinds of things happen. 
Why is that important? 
Every Member needs to have their 
voice heard, and they should be heard 
on the bill. They should be heard when 
this body wants to change our con-
stitutional protections fundamentally. 
The right to keep and bear arms shall 
not be infringed. The majority doesn’t 
seek to amend the Constitution, but 
they seek to nullify that constitutional 
guarantee with subterfuge. 
They say that this is a background 
check bill. Well, every commercial fire-
arm transaction today already requires 
a background check. It doesn’t matter 
whether you do it at a gun store, at a 
gun show, or at any other forum, if you 
buy a firearm from a commercial seller 
of firearms, a Federal firearm license 
holder, you have to do a background 
check. You can’t do it, Mr. Speaker. 
Now, what does this do? 
It basically says, Mr. Speaker, that if 
you want to even loan a gun to a fam-
ily member to go on a hunting trip, 
then you have to get a background 
check. Someone would be criminalized 
for doing that. You can’t have private 
transfers. Essentially, the government 
says you can’t be trusted to sell a fire-
arm to anybody. You have to go to a li-
censed agent of the Federal Govern-
ment. 
How do they guarantee that? 
They guarantee that by creating a 
registry. 
Why should we be concerned about 
that? 
Well, that is the path toward seizing 
it. It doesn’t guarantee that the Gov-
ernment will do it, but let me tell you 
about the Supreme Court and what is 
going on right now, Mr. Speaker. 
Under the Fourth Amendment, there 
is a clause that has been interpreted by 
Court opinions to allow seizures for 
community care—warrantless seizures 
of property. This goes with civil asset 
forfeiture and all kinds of abuses of 
warrantless 
surveillance 
and 
the 
Fourth Amendment. If we do not stand 
up and defend the Second Amendment 
today, it will be just as abused as the 
Fourth Amendment’s guarantee of pri-
vacy is today. 
We have to oppose this bill. The peo-
ple of the United States of America are 
constitutionally guaranteed the right 
to keep and bear arms, and this body 
shall not infringe it, and it shall not be 
infringed 
without 
a 
constitutional 
amendment, and that is not what is on 
the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to op-
pose H.R. 8 and any such effort to deny 
the American citizens the protections 
our Constitution guarantees. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BUDD).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1183 
March 9, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, as a Feder-
ally licensed gun store owner, I have a 
unique 
perspective 
on 
our 
Second 
Amendment rights, and I actually hap-
pen to know how background checks 
actually work. 
It seems that H.R. 8 is being sold as 
universal background checks, and it 
would impose harsh penalties, like six- 
figure fines and jail time, for the sim-
ple act of handing a firearm to another 
person even for temporary use, like in-
struction. 
The exemptions under H.R. 8 are woe-
fully inadequate to protect the rights 
of law-abiding gun owners. 
Let’s say, Mr. Speaker, that you loan 
your firearm to a victim of domestic 
violence because their abuser is just 
getting ready to be released from jail, 
or if a suicidal friend asks you to take 
possession of their firearm, or if you 
loan your cousin a gun after a series of 
burglaries in their neighborhood. These 
new transfer penalties would turn law- 
abiding citizens into criminals. 
We simply cannot sacrifice our rights 
by passing laws that will make our 
families less safe and laws that crimi-
nals will simply ignore. We must al-
ways protect and preserve our God- 
given Second Amendment rights. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his speech. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Shall not be 
infringed. Shall not be infringed. The 
right of the people to keep and bear 
arms shall not be infringed. 
James Madison, our fourth President, 
the primary architect of the Constitu-
tion and the first Congressman from 
Virginia’s Fifth District, said: ‘‘Ameri-
cans have the right and advantage of 
being armed—unlike the citizens of 
other countries whose governments are 
afraid to trust the people with arms.’’ 
Our right to arm and defend our-
selves is a God-given right, and we are 
privileged to live in a country whose 
Founders had the wisdom and the 
strength to codify that right in the 
Constitution. 
James Madison and our other Found-
ers recognized that this was a funda-
mental right to protect our rights to 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness; and they had the foresight to in-
clude this right among those first 10 
amendments listed in the Constitution 
which were intended to protect us from 
our government. It was James Madison 
who also said: ‘‘The truth is that all 
men having power ought to be mis-
trusted.’’ 
The Second Amendment is not about 
hunting—that is great. It is not, again, 
primarily about self-defense or pro-
tecting our family—that is essential. It 
is about being a check against tyranny 
and ensure we remain a free people. 
There is a reason it was the second 
right listed in the Bill of Rights—sec-
ond only to the First Amendment pro-
tections of our right to free speech, as-
sembly, 
and 
worship. 
The 
Second 
Amendment is the guarantor or pro-
tector of all other rights. If our Second 
Amendment right is not safe, then no 
rights are safe, and with this Democrat 
majority in this Congress, this right is 
not safe. 
In my last quote tonight from James 
Madison, he also said: ‘‘I believe there 
are more instances of the abridgement 
of freedom of the people by gradual and 
silent encroachments by those in power 
than 
by 
violent 
and 
sudden 
usurpations.’’ 
We are witnessing the gradual en-
croachment on our fundamental Sec-
ond Amendment right today by this 
Democrat majority. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
my friend from Texas (Mr. CLOUD). 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, what we 
are considering here today with H.R. 8 
has been dubbed a universal back-
ground check bill, but in reality, it 
would criminalize—let me say that 
again—it would criminalize the private 
transfer of firearms. 
As part of the march to strip Ameri-
cans 
of 
their 
guaranteed 
Second 
Amendment right, this gun control bill 
would make it a crime to sell or trans-
fer a firearm without first seeking per-
mission from the almighty Govern-
ment. 
The dirty secret is that the pro-
ponents of gun control, Mr. Speaker, 
want you to think that this is the end 
of the road when, in fact, that is not 
true. In 2013 President Obama’s Depart-
ment of Justice’s National Institute of 
Justice said that the effectiveness of 
universal background checks depends 
on requiring gun registration. 
So what we are witnessing here today 
is the first step to requiring a nation-
wide gun registration in America. 
The Second Amendment to the Con-
stitution says: ‘‘A well regulated mili-
tia, being necessary to the security of 
a free State, the right of the people to 
keep and bear arms, shall not be in-
fringed.’’ 
In this Nation of ‘‘We the People,’’ 
we recognize that we as citizens are 
not subjects of our government and 
that our inalienable rights are not a 
grant from the government but a gift 
from God, and to that end the Second 
Amendment doesn’t grant us a right, 
but rather those carefully crafted 
words acknowledge an already existing 
right: the right of the people to possess 
a firearm. 
The Constitution does not say you 
may or may not be able to own a fire-
arm, we will circle back with you, we 
will get back with you on that. 
It doesn’t. It guarantees the right. 
This bill does nothing to make com-
munities more safe. This is another 
overreaching attempt by leftist leaders 
drunk on unchecked power to control 
the lives of freedom-loving citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
oppose this legislation. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. NORMAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, the right 
of the people to keep and bear arms in 
the United States is a fundamental 
principle expressed in our Bill of 
Rights. 
Let me be clear: I will never do any-
thing to infringe upon this right clear-
ly laid out in our Second Amendment, 
but this bill, H.R. 8, will do just that. 
H.R. 8 is a sweeping piece of legisla-
tion that imposes burdens on the con-
stitutional rights of law-abiding citi-
zens. It is plain and simple. This bill is 
another attempt by Democrats to limit 
the rights of the American people. 
This legislation would make it a 
crime, subject to limited exceptions, to 
simply hand a firearm to another per-
son. This bill could trigger penalties of 
up to a year in prison and a $100,000 
fine. 
This bill would make it illegal to 
transfer a firearm to another person 
during a life-threatening emergency. 
That could be considered a crime pun-
ishable by a fine of monetary dollars. 
Also, just so we are on the same 
page, universal background checks do 
not stop criminals from possessing fire-
arms. As my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have said: In the 
United States less than one percent of 
criminals who had possessed a firearm 
during 
their 
offense 
got 
firearms 
through legal channels—less than one 
percent. That means that these crimi-
nals obtained their firearms outside of 
the setting that would require a back-
ground check to begin with. 
What makes you believe that this 
legislation would change that, Mr. 
Speaker? 
Our solution should be focused on im-
proving access to mental healthcare 
services, addressing the root causes of 
violence, and carrying out our existing 
laws through investments in our law 
enforcement 
and 
community 
pro-
grams—not walking all over law-abid-
ing citizens for protecting their loved 
ones. We all swore to uphold the Con-
stitution, and it should be our goal in 
this Congress to work against legisla-
tion like this that would clearly in-
fringe 
on 
our 
Second 
Amendment 
rights of American citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I will be a resounding 
‘‘no’’ when it is time to vote. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. 
GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to Democrat gun 
control bills far and wide. 
I would like to tell you about a gun 
law in Georgia: In order to provide for 
the emergency management of the 
city, and further, in order to provide 
for and protect the safety, security and 
general welfare of the city and its in-
habitants, every head of household re-
siding in the city limits is required to 
maintain a firearm, together with am-
munition. 
b 2145 
Mr. Speaker, that is Kennesaw, Geor-
gia, where, over 6 years, there has only 
been one murder and a violent crime 
rate of 2 percent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1184 
March 9, 2021 
Would you like to know why? It is 
because every single criminal knows 
that if they are going to attack some-
one in Kennesaw, Georgia, they are 
going to go across a gun owner, and it 
is the law that every household and 
homeowner owns a gun and keeps one 
in their household. 
You see, guns are not scary. The fact 
that we may not have guns is scary. 
Guns are a great form of protection. It 
is an equalizer to a criminal who could 
care less about all the gun laws that 
Democrats want to pass on Americans, 
infringing on their Second Amendment 
rights. 
H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 are just more 
gun control legislation violating Amer-
icans’ great right to bear arms. I rise 
in opposition to both of these bills, and 
I hope that the Democrats will come to 
their senses and figure out that gun 
rights are American rights. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. 
BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, in 2019, 
as a private citizen, a mom, a small 
business owner, I was ticked off that a 
politician running for President of the 
United States wanted to strip away our 
enumerated constitutional rights. So 
with my Glock on my hip, I drove 3 
hours to tell Robert Francis O’Rourke, 
also known as Beto, hell no, you are 
not taking our guns. 
That message resonated with mil-
lions of Americans. But, sadly, the 
Democrat Party, isolated in their base-
ments and gated mansions, still hasn’t 
gotten the message. Those on the left 
who would steamroll the rights of law- 
abiding citizens are still at it. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle seem to be totally oblivious 
to the message Americans sent in 2020. 
Nearly 8.5 million Americans pur-
chased a firearm for the very first time 
in 2020. With the left defunding the po-
lice, and antifa rioting, looting, burn-
ing down businesses, people made the 
reasonable and rational decision to 
take self-protection seriously and arm 
themselves. 
And the Democrat response? More 
regulations, more bureaucracy, more 
control, less freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say it again, and 
I will say it nice and loud so everyone 
can hear me. Those on the left are still 
tucked away safely in their gated man-
sions with their armed security, ignor-
ing everyday Americans. 
For me, this is a hell no. It is a hell 
no to government treading on our 
rights. It is a hell no to the regulation 
of our Second Amendment. It is a hell 
no to government trampling on our 
freedoms. 
All these new gun laws will do is 
leave law-abiding citizens defenseless 
while criminals—wait for it—break the 
law. 
So, I have a few questions for my col-
leagues on the left. I want to know, 
why do you trust the American people 
so little? Why do you look down on 
them as lesser than you? How detached 
are you to believe that someone else’s 
rights should be subject to bureau-
cratic permission, to your permission? 
Why is it okay to provide armed secu-
rity for yourself but take away the 
right of Americans to do so them-
selves? 
Why do you feel the need to keep a 
registry of gun owners? Do you not 
trust the American people? Are you 
afraid of your neighbors? Do you de-
spise their rights? 
How much power over the American 
people will it take to satisfy these radi-
cals on the left? Our rights don’t come 
from politicians. They come from God 
Almighty. Stop pretending to be God. 
Do your job and protect the rights of 
the American people. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Montana (Mr. 
ROSENDALE). 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to the extreme gun control meas-
ures being pushed by the Democratic 
majority. Make no mistake, they are 
extreme and an assault on our free-
doms. 
The Second Amendment guarantees 
the right of every American to keep 
and bear arms. I am proud to be from 
the State with the highest rate of gun 
ownership in the Nation. In Montana, 
law-abiding gun owners use firearms 
every day and exercise their God-given 
liberties. 
Mr. Speaker, the bills in the House 
this week serve only to punish respon-
sible gun owners and take away the 
Second Amendment rights of Mon-
tanans. 
H.R. 8 would not just require back-
ground checks for the sale of firearms 
but for changes of ownership and even 
the most temporary transfers of pos-
session. Someone who simply hands a 
firearm to another person could be sub-
ject to a year in prison and a $100,000 
fine. 
This would include the rancher who 
lends his gun to a neighbor whose cat-
tle are being harassed by coyotes or to 
the hunter who lends a rifle to a buddy 
who is going on a hunting trip. This is 
deeply troubling, as these scenarios are 
very common in Montana. 
H.R. 1446 is just as bad. While it 
claims to close a gun-buying loophole, 
it would give the FBI discretion to 
delay firearm purchases or transfers in-
definitely and could even put the bur-
den on law-abiding citizens to prove 
that they are eligible to purchase a 
firearm. 
The Framers of our Constitution did 
not intend for us to have to beg the 
government to be able to exercise our 
freedoms. In fact, they included the 
Second Amendment to make sure that 
we didn’t have to. ‘‘Shall not be in-
fringed’’ is extremely clear. Unfortu-
nately, that is exactly the path that 
Democrats seem intent on pursuing. 
I thank my colleagues who stand 
with me today, and I urge all of my 
colleagues who cherish our constitu-
tional liberties to join me in opposing 
these bills and any other bill that 
would infringe on our Second Amend-
ment rights. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. 
MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my friend and colleague, 
Congressman BIGGS, for this Special 
Order. 
We swore an oath to defend the Con-
stitution, which includes the Second 
Amendment. But now, Democrats are 
going back on that oath by proposing 
H.R. 8, saying that we should enforce 
universal background checks on guns. 
Continuing to put forth far-reaching 
laws on guns will only significantly in-
crease the burden of the millions of 
law-abiding Americans who wish to ex-
ercise their Second Amendment right 
to self-defense. 
In my State of Illinois, Chicago has 
the fourth-strictest gun laws in the 
country, but criminal misuse of fire-
arms in Chicago remains at the top of 
the list. This is because, if there is one 
thing that we know about criminals, it 
is that they don’t care about obeying 
the law. 
The Second Amendment was written 
to prevent the government from seizing 
arms. H.R. 8 is an attack on our rights 
and is one step closer to doing exactly 
what 
our 
Founders 
were 
guarding 
against. 
We do not need to punish law-abiding 
citizens. Instead, we should do all we 
can to cherish and protect this right 
that we are so blessed to have. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, it is now 
my privilege to yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in de-
fense of the Second Amendment and in 
opposition to H.R. 8, the universal 
background checks act. 
Federal law already restricts trans-
ferring firearms to prohibited individ-
uals. Instead of working to strengthen 
the enforcement of laws currently on 
the books, this legislation will crim-
inalize many activities that are com-
mon practice among law-abiding gun 
owners, while failing to prevent guns 
from getting into the hands of crimi-
nals. 
Criminals do not follow the law when 
obtaining their firearms, and nothing 
in the bill would prevent them from 
continuing to obtain firearms through 
avenues like the black market, theft, 
or illegal straw purchases. 
Federal law already strictly prohibits 
the possession, receipt, or purchase of 
firearms by prohibited individuals, in-
cluding convicted felons, fugitives from 
justice, unlawful users of controlled 
substances, illegal aliens, and individ-
uals subject to protective orders or 
convicted of a crime of domestic vio-
lence. 
Meanwhile, 
law-abiding 
citizens 
could face up to a year in prison and a 
$100,000 fine for common practices such 
as trades, private sales, gifts, or tem-
porary loans of firearms if this bill be-
comes law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1185 
March 9, 2021 
Lastly, I will note that under the 
rules of interpretation in H.R. 8, it 
says: ‘‘Rules of interpretation. Nothing 
in this act, or any amendment made by 
this act, shall be construed to: author-
ize the establishment, directly or indi-
rectly, of a national firearms registry.’’ 
That is false. This bill will create a 
national registry. That is because 
every firearms transfer has to go 
through a Federal firearms licensee’s 
acquisition and disposition logbook. 
And every time a Federal firearms li-
cense is not renewed, those records 
must be sent to the ATF for storage, 
which, in turn, scans those records into 
a database for a future use. That is, in 
effect, a national firearms registry in 
the making. 
If the rules of interpretation of H.R. 
8 are correctly followed, then one could 
logically argue that this bill actually 
prohibits itself by, in its own words, 
prohibiting, directly or indirectly, a 
national firearms registry. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I thank the gentleman from Georgia. 
I thank all of my colleagues. I appre-
ciate the opportunity to be with so 
many of my friends who support the 
Second Amendment and oppose H.R. 8. 
I was talking earlier tonight about 
the Heller decision, where Justice 
Scalia said the Second Amendment is a 
preexisting right. Justice Scalia wrote: 
‘‘There seems to us no doubt, on the 
basis of both text and history, that the 
Second Amendment conferred an indi-
vidual right to keep and bear arms.’’ 
He did state ‘‘the right was not unlim-
ited,’’ but the bill being considered 
goes well beyond acceptable limita-
tions. 
H.R. 8 is another bill that the major-
ity is bringing to the floor this session 
without a hearing or markup in the Ju-
diciary Committee. 
Last Congress, the markup of H.R. 8 
was cut short when the chairman of the 
committee introduced an amendment 
in the nature of a substitute right in 
the middle of the markup after Repub-
licans repeatedly offered amendments 
highlighting flaws in the bill. He didn’t 
allow Members opposed to the amend-
ment to speak or offer amendments. He 
then called for the vote on the sub-
stitute amendment. This hurried proc-
ess demonstrated that Democrats cared 
more about simply passing a bill than 
passing a good bill. 
H.R. 8 would not have prevented re-
cent shootings. In Parkland, the shoot-
er acquired the firearm legally from an 
FFL after undergoing a NICS check. 
In Sutherland Springs, Texas, the 
shooter made purchases from an FFL 
following a NICS check. 
In Las Vegas, the shooter purchased 
his firearms from an FFL after a back-
ground check. 
In Orlando, the shooter purchased his 
firearms legally from an FFL following 
a NICS check. 
I can go on, but there are so many 
more examples that are just the same 
because criminals who seek to do harm 
will get guns, regardless of the new re-
strictions imposed by H.R. 8. That is 
just the nature of criminals. 
I was a prosecutor and a criminal de-
fense attorney. I can tell you, that is 
the way criminals are. They violate the 
law. 
With very limited exceptions, H.R. 8 
makes it illegal for Americans to get a 
gun if a nonlicensed importer, manu-
facturer, or dealer is involved. And how 
will the government know if an illegal 
transfer occurs? 
Eventually, 
the 
government 
will 
have to create a registry of all firearms 
and firearm owners so that they can 
track all transfers. That is what they 
want to do here. Without a registry, 
this bill is utterly unenforceable. 
I have heard supporters of this bill 
say that other countries have similar 
restrictions, so we need to do the same 
as well. But the reality is, there is no 
other country on the face of this planet 
that has a Second Amendment, where 
the Founders of that country said the 
right to bear arms and protect yourself 
against government and individuals is 
a God-given right and deserves to be 
protected. It is, as Justice Scalia said, 
a preexisting right. 
Supporters say that this bill is about 
saving lives. If that is what is impor-
tant, then I would encourage every 
supporter of this bill to join me in co-
sponsoring the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act, which actu-
ally will save lives. I urge Speaker 
PELOSI to bring that bill to the floor 
today. 
I oppose this bill. I urge all of my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for being here tonight, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

S1409 
Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MARCH 9, 2021 
No. 44 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, today, make our Sen-
ators custodians of truth. Remind 
them that when people call a lie the 
truth, they tamper with their value 
judgment. 
Lord, give our lawmakers the wisdom 
to know that to scrape away their 
value judgment will eventually cause 
them to lose their sense of moral dis-
tinctions. May they understand that 
deception is difficult to quarantine and 
will corrupt all sense of moral dis-
crimination. 
Lord, thank You for being a shelter 
for the oppressed, a refuge in times of 
trouble. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Morn-
ing business is closed. 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the nomination, which 
the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of MARCIA
LOUISE
FUDGE, of 
Ohio, to be Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Arkansas. 
CENSORSHIP 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, most 
Americans know that there are two 
sexes, male and female, and that sex is 
rooted in science. Most Americans also 
know that we ought to treat all people, 
including those who feel conflicted 
about their gender, with respect and 
dignity, without sacrificing the truth 
in the process. 
These beliefs are now under attack 
from some of the most powerful cor-
porations in the history of the world. 
Just a few weeks ago, while House 
Democrats were passing their far-left 
Equality Act, the leftwing media was 
busy canceling Dr. Seuss, Amazon 
quietly erased a book from its online 
store without notice, without warning, 
without explanation. That book is 
‘‘When Harry Became Sally: Respond-
ing to the Transgender Moment by 
Ryan Anderson.’’ 
Amazon claims it banned this book 
for violating its brandnew policy on 
‘‘hate speech.’’ Of course, that excuse 
is arbitrary and patently false. You can 
go to Amazon right now—right now 
you can go to Amazon on your phone or 
on your computer and buy copies of ac-
tually hateful books. You can get Hit-
ler’s ‘‘Mein Kampf’’ shipped to your 
door with free Amazon Prime delivery. 
You can get the ‘‘Unabomber Mani-
festo,’’ written by a serial killer who 
murdered 3 people and maimed 23 oth-
ers. You can even get ‘‘How to Blow up 
a Pipeline.’’ I assume the title speaks 
for itself. All those books are available 
for purchase on Amazon right now, one 
click away. But Amazon wants you to 
believe that a conservative book is 
somehow beyond the pale, unaccept-
ably hateful, literally worse than Hit-
ler, as they like to say. 
My office asked Amazon to send us 
the exact passages from ‘‘When Harry 
Became Sally’’ that it deemed so hate-
ful that it couldn’t even sell the book 
on its website. Shocking surprise, I 
know, they never got back to us. That 
is because the book doesn’t say any-
thing hateful. To the contrary, the 
book makes very clear that we should 
treat people who feel conflicted about 
their gender with the same respect and 
compassion that are due to all people. 
To quote the author, ‘‘We should have 
abundant compassion and charity and 
patience with people who feel this form 
of alienation. But we also need to in-
sist on telling the truth . . . ’’ 
That is not hate. That is far from it. 
The author’s real offense, his only of-
fense, was telling the truth. He said 
calmly and compassionately that boys 
are boys and girls are girls. And the 
richest man in the world banned his 
book from his company’s platform. 
But, of course, you don’t have to 
agree with the commonsense historic 
understanding of gender in order to ac-
knowledge how dangerous it is for one 
of the biggest corporations in the his-
tory of the world to start banning 
books because while Amazon’s censor-
ship 
may 
start 
with 
conservative 
views, it could easily mutate to censor 
other views that offend Jeff Bezos and 
his bottom line. Perhaps Amazon will 
come after union organizers next since 
they are trying to bust up a union elec-
tion in Alabama or maybe environ-
mental 
activists 
or 
maybe 
trustbusters, since so many people are 
talking about potential antitrust viola-
tions in the world of Big Tech. 
And even if Amazon goes only this 
far and no further, the damage of free

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1410 
March 9, 2021 
speech has already been done. Books 
like ‘‘When Harry Became Sally’’ won’t 
get published anymore. Writers who 
hold unfashionable opinions that just a 
few days ago were considered basic 
mainstream views of a large majority 
of Americans, may decide to self-cen-
sor, stay silent. 
The virtual book burning may spread 
to other companies. Maybe Amazon 
will put a book burning app on its Kin-
dle so readers can drag books from its 
catalog into the virtual bonfire. 
Political correctness will only grow 
more oppressive if its enforcers, like 
Amazon, don’t face some consequences 
for their actions. Amazon, for instance, 
makes billions of dollars each year 
hosting websites and storing data for 
the government. Almost all of Ama-
zon’s profit is made in these enterprise 
services, not in its consumer-facing re-
tail business. Those are our tax dollars 
flowing to a company that uses its 
power to censor the beliefs of a large 
majority of Americans. Perhaps it is 
time 
for 
lawmakers 
to 
reconsider 
whether these contracts are in the best 
interest of our country. 
I also note Amazon is the country’s 
largest bookseller, selling three out of 
every four e-books in America. It is 
time for lawmakers to evaluate wheth-
er Amazon’s practices are consistent 
with our antitrust laws or whether 
antitrust laws need to be updated to 
address this type of behavior from a 
monopolistic firm. We better hurry, 
though, because maybe they will ban 
all books on antitrust and monopoly 
behavior before we have a chance to 
study the question. 
I will close by quoting from the book 
that Amazon banned, which predicted 
the very events we are witnessing here 
today: 
If trans activists succeed in their political 
agenda, our nation’s children will be indoc-
trinated in a harmful ideology, and some will 
live by its own lies about their own bodies, 
at great harm to themselves physically, psy-
chologically, and socially. Lives will be ru-
ined, but pointing out the damage will be 
forbidden. Dissent from the transgender 
worldview will be punished in schools, work-
places, and medical clinics. Trying to live in 
accordance with the truth will be made hard-
er. 
This is not a fight over hate or big-
otry, respect or compassion. It is a bat-
tle over truth itself, the truth of who 
we are as human beings and the funda-
mental freedom to speak that truth or 
any other truth without fear. 
Throughout our history, Americans 
have never surrendered to an oppres-
sive tyranny of opinion, whether a ma-
jority or, in this case, a small but high-
ly influential minority, and we won’t 
be cowed in silence today. We will fight 
for what is true. We will fight for the 
freedom to say it. No matter what the 
cultural forces arrayed against us do, 
we will never back down. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SINEMA). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate returns this week to the 
business of nominations. Today, the 
Senate will confirm Congresswoman 
MARCIA FUDGE to be the Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development, fol-
lowed by confirmation votes later this 
week for Merrick Garland to serve as 
Attorney General and Michael Regan 
to serve as the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
Finally, the Senate will begin the 
confirmation 
process 
for 
Congress-
woman DEB HAALAND before the week 
is out. She would be the first Native 
American 
Cabinet 
member 
of 
any 
Agency and the first indigenous Sec-
retary of the Interior—a profoundly 
important moment given the histori-
cally troubled relationship between the 
Federal Government and Tribal na-
tions. Despite Republican obstruction, 
Representative HAALAND will be con-
firmed by the Senate to be Secretary 
HAALAND. I will file cloture on her 
nomination immediately after my re-
marks. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
Now on the rescue plan, on Saturday, 
the American people got to see what a 
responsive and effective government 
looks like. A month and a half after as-
suming the majority, Senate Demo-
crats followed through on our promise 
to deliver a bold COVID relief bill to 
help crush the virus, lift this country 
out of the crisis, and set our economy 
on a path to a strong recovery. 
Earlier today, the final text of the 
Senate bill was sent to the House of 
Representatives. Congress remains on 
track to deliver the American Rescue 
Plan to President Biden’s desk for his 
signature before enhanced unemploy-
ment benefits expire on March 14. 
We said we would do it. We are doing 
it. 
Once 
President 
Biden 
signs 
the 
American Rescue Plan into law, it will 
immediately become one of the most 
sweeping Federal recovery efforts in 
modern history. It will help restore 
Americans’ faith in government at a 
time when that is sorely needed, and it 
will deliver more help to more people 
than almost anything Congress has ac-
complished in past decades. 
Already the positive reviews are 
pouring in. According to several re-
ports, the bill will help millions of 
Americans save hundreds of dollars in 
healthcare costs. Thanks to a historic 
expansion of the child tax credit—up to 
$3,000 per child under 17 for an over-
whelming majority of families—ana-
lysts predict the American Rescue Plan 
will cut child poverty in half. 
Let me say that again: Analysts pre-
dict the American Rescue Plan will cut 
child poverty in half. This has been a 
goal of this country for decades, and 
now we are taking real steps to accom-
plish it. 
In fact, the Tax Policy Center pre-
dicts the American Rescue Plan will 
boost the incomes of the poorest 20 per-
cent of Americans by 20 percent, in-
cluding significant boosts all the way 
through the middle class. 
Meanwhile, the wealthiest 1 percent 
of Americans will receive an income 
boost of zero—zero percent for the top 
1 percent wealthiest Americans. 
Let me say that again because this 
shows who we are as a party here in the 
Senate and who we should be as a na-
tion. Let me say: A 20-percent boost in 
incomes for Americans who are strug-
gling the most; zero percent for those 
who are at the top already, who are 
doing very well. 
Let’s contrast this to the Republican 
tax bill, which skewed in exactly the 
opposite direction. If people want to 
know the difference—the difference in 
terms of how Democrats feel about 
whom we should help and how Repub-
licans feel about whom we should 
help—contrast this bill with the most 
major accomplishment during the 4 
years that Donald Trump was Presi-
dent and it is very apparent. 
Back in December, Democrats prom-
ised that, if we won the majority, we 
would deliver $2,000 checks to Amer-
ican families. That is exactly what we 
have done. Promise made; promise 
kept. We helped pass $600 checks in De-
cember and added $1,400 in the bill we 
just passed. 
Because Democrats kept that prom-
ise, Americans are going to receive the 
help they need quickly. The checks 
will stimulate the economy, and they 
are targeted to those Americans who 
need it the most. It is a promise kept. 
The OECD, or the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Develop-
ment, projected that the American 
Rescue Plan could as much as double 
America’s economic growth this year. 
As a result, it also revised upward its 
projections for the entire world’s eco-
nomic recovery. Once again, the United 
States is going to lead the way. 
And so, because of what the Senate 
did last week, healthcare costs will go 
down, child poverty will be cut in half, 
Americans will receive direct financial 
support, and the economy is set for an 
enormous boost. It is a great beginning 
for a new administration and a new 
Senate. 
And that is to say nothing of the 
schools that will receive support to re-
open faster and safer, the restaurants 
and small businesses that will receive a 
lifeline, the millions of recently unem-
ployed Americans who will continue to 
receive enhanced benefits until Labor 
Day, and the millions of workers and 
retirees who will see their pension 
plans protected. 
Of course, one of the most important 
aspects of all is the support this bill 
will give to speed vaccinations and ex-
pand testing—exactly what we need to 
defeat the virus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1411 
March 9, 2021 
In short, this is one of the very most 
significant pieces of legislation to pass 
the Senate in years. It is broader, deep-
er, and more comprehensive in helping 
working families and lifting Americans 
out of poverty than anything—any-
thing—Congress has accomplished in a 
very long time. 
So I am extremely proud of the bill 
we 
passed 
this 
week—exceedingly 
proud. I am exceedingly proud of every-
body in our caucus; our committee 
chairs, whose leadership allowed us to 
act swiftly at a moment when Ameri-
cans needed help fast; and the Mem-
bers, who pulled together and realized 
no one is going to get everything he or 
she wants, but the need to come to-
gether and get something done when 
we had no margin for error was won-
derful. 
I want to thank President Biden for 
his bold and steady leadership. He was 
instrumental in putting this bill to-
gether and helping to get it over the 
finish line. 
And I am exceedingly proud of the 
staff, who toiled behind the scenes, who 
worked incredible hours under incred-
ible stress to prepare, perfect, and pass 
the American Rescue Plan. The staff 
are the unsung heroes of this bill. So I 
want to spend just a moment to sing 
their praises. 
First of all, to all the members and 
staff of the Senate committees, thank 
you. I have submitted all of their 
names into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
to acknowledge their weeks of hard 
work assembling different portions of 
the 
bill, 
negotiating 
compromises, 
writing legislative text, petitioning the 
Parliamentarian, and managing a co-
lossal amendment process. 
To all of the floor staff—the door-
keepers, the clerks, the reporters, the 
cafeteria workers, the custodial staff, 
the 
Capitol 
Police 
and 
National 
Guard—the entire Senate gave you a 
standing ovation on Saturday, and you 
deserved every second of it. Thank you, 
thank you, thank you once again. 
And, finally, I need to spend some 
time thanking my own staff. I think 
they are the best staff anyone could 
ever have. They are amazing. They are 
amazing. Every Senator believes they 
have the best staff on Capitol Hill, I 
guess, but I am no exception. I couldn’t 
do what I do without them. They are 
amazing. The chiefs who run the show: 
Mike Lynch, Martin Brennan, Erin 
Sager Vaughn. The floor staff: the 
amazing Gary Myrick, Tricia Engle, 
the whole floor staff—thank you. 
And then three names that I have to 
give a particular shout-out to because 
you could truly say that without these 
three we wouldn’t have a bill: Gerry 
Petrella, Meghan Taira, Charlie Ells-
worth. 
My staff—I would like to brag a little 
about them if I might. My staff boasts 
some of the most brilliant legislative 
minds in the country—folks who know 
the nitty-gritty of every issue in their 
portfolio, who fashion solutions to the 
most difficult problems in the country 
and then turn those solutions into ac-
tion. 
And thank you to my executive 
team, who keeps me somewhat on time 
and is a tremendous asset to the entire 
Democratic caucus. 
Thank you to our phenomenal re-
search team, ready to supply the right 
fact at the right moment. You ask 
them: Look this up, find this out. 
Boom, the answer appears right away. 
To everyone at the Senate Demo-
cratic Media Center, the SDMC, who 
are clipping and editing videos at 3, 4, 
5 in the morning; to our amazing press 
team, who gets the word out so skill-
fully; our engagement team, who does 
fantastic work with the groups affected 
by the legislation we pass; and our en-
tire State staff—I just visited some of 
them. I just came back from Buffalo 
and Syracuse—who make sure that our 
work in Washington always responds to 
the needs of New York. 
I wanted to mention each of these 
different groups, but in reality they are 
a team. They pull together, and they 
are friends as well. They celebrate holi-
days together, and we share each oth-
er’s joys and sadnesses in life—a team 
that works together, helps each other, 
supports each other, and supports me; a 
team that gets up every morning with 
a passion to make the lives of their fel-
low citizens better. It is impossible, 
just impossible not to be inspired by 
them and by that. 
So I ask unanimous consent to enter 
the names of my entire staff into the 
RECORD because, as I told them on the 
phone Sunday, even if they do nothing 
else in life, they have saved by their 
work many, many lives. They have 
made the lives of millions—millions— 
of people considerably better because 
of their hard work, their dedication, 
and their faith. 
So I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD the names of my 
entire staff. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
I would like the Record to include the 
names of my staff who worked tirelessly to 
prepare, perfect, and pass the American Res-
cue Plan: one of the most significant pieces

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
when Senators were last in this Cham-
ber, our Democratic colleagues were 
shooting 
down 
amendment 
after 
amendment to ensure their largely 
non-COVID-related spending plan re-
mained very liberal and purely par-
tisan. 
Republicans proposed amendments to 
cap extra government help for wealthi-
er Americans, to ensure that direct 
checks would only go to citizens and 
legal residents and not to people in 
prison, and to rein in runaway State 
and local bailouts and refocus the bill 
on urgent COVID-related actual needs. 
But Democrats banded together to de-
feat every one of these commonsense 
changes. As the Democratic leader hap-
pily explained to reporters later on 
Saturday, his whole conference put 
lockstep party unity ahead of sub-
stance and ahead of bipartisan com-
promise. 
So the nearly $2 trillion partisan 
spending spree that President Biden’s 
Chief of Staff brags is ‘‘the most pro-
gressive domestic legislation in a gen-
eration’’ is on its way over to the 
House. Already, we hear reporting that 
this giveaway will simply wipe out the 
budget deficit of New York State and 
eliminate a big part of the deficit in 
San Francisco, courtesy of the tax-
payers in Kentucky and Middle Amer-
ica. Already, we hear the administra-
tion saying they want some of these 
sweeping new welfare policies to be-
come permanent, like a no-strings-at-
tached benefit that disregards all the 
pro-work lessons of bipartisan welfare 
reform. Meanwhile, it only manages to 
spend about 1 percent on vaccinations 
and less than 9 percent on the entire 
health fight. 
Democrats inherited a turning tide. 
The 
vaccine 
trends 
and 
economic 
trends were in place before the bill was 
ever voted on, before this President 
was sworn in, but they are determined 
to push to the front of the parade with 
an effort to push America to the left. 
Meanwhile, 
House 
Democrats 
are 
wasting no time pursuing even more 
purely 
partisan 
legislation. 
Last 
Wednesday, the House passed H.R. 1, 
their effort to rewrite the ground rules 
of American elections and seize power 
from States and localities. Just like 
the spending plan, in both Chambers, 
once again the only thing bipartisan 
about the bill was the opposition. 
This is House Democrats’ bid to put 
Federal bureaucrats in charge of local 
election rules; to undermine voter ID 
requirements with massive loopholes 
that undermine them; to require every 
State to permit ballot harvesting, 
which lets paid political operatives 
produce stacks of ballots with other 
people’s names on them; to overturn or 
change hundreds of State election laws; 
and to turn our highest election au-
thority, the equally balanced FEC, into 
a partisan majority body to crack 
down on speech and ideas they don’t 
like. 
It is quite the recipe for rebuilding 
public faith in our democracy on all 
sides—a purely partisan effort to seize 
unprecedented power for Washington, 
DC, on a razor-thin majority. It is a 
hugely harmful idea at the worst pos-
sible time. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, on a different mat-
ter, this week, the Senate is set to con-
sider more of President Biden’s nomi-
nations. I have consistently said that 
the President should have latitude to 
staff their administration with people 
of their choosing so long as they nomi-
nate qualified and mainstream individ-
uals. That is why I and many other Re-
publicans have supported many of the 
President’s mainstream nominees. 
Secretaries Austin and Vilsack were 
each confirmed with more than 90 
votes; Secretaries Raimondo, Yellen, 
and Buttigieg with more than 80. Sen-
ator Blinken got 78 votes, including 
mine. 
Secretaries 
Cardona 
and 
Granholm each got more than 60 votes. 
Even with the time spent on impeach-
ment, half of the nominees I just men-
tioned were confirmed faster than 
President Trump’s nominees to the 
same spots, and most of them received 
a more bipartisan margin now than 4 
years ago. So this administration is re-
ceiving perfectly fair treatment from 
the Senate. Frankly, the President and 
his team must be thrilled that Senate 
Republicans are proving to be more fair 
and more principled on personnel mat-
ters than the Democratic minority’s 
behavior 4 years ago. 
But the fact remains that millions 
and millions of Americans elected 50 
Republican Senators—an even split—to 
stand against policies and personnel 
who lean too far to the left. That is 
why many of us voted against con-
firming 
Secretary 
Mayorkas, 
who 
stood idly by while a major crisis ex-
ploded on the border in just his first 
several weeks. Rather than confront 
the problem, he absurdly claims that a 
record number of unaccompanied chil-
dren in custody, overflowing shelters, 
and catch-and-release policies during a 
pandemic do not actually constitute a 
‘‘crisis’’ at all. 
Xavier Becerra, the partisan Cali-
fornia attorney general with no signifi-
cant healthcare experience, whom the 
President has nominated to run Health 
and Human Services during COVID–19, 
could not even get one Republican vote 
to get out of committee. 
So Republicans will continue to dis-
tinguish 
between 
qualified, 
main-
stream people and nominees who are 
way outside the mainstream. 
I have already announced I will sup-
port Judge Merrick Garland, whose 
nomination to be Attorney General we 
will vote to advance later today, but 
we will continue to fight hard against 
people who are the wrong choices for 
key positions. We are going to shine a 
bright spotlight on anyone who seems 
more focused on far-left ideology than 
serving all of the American people. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant majority leader. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
had a press conference this Sunday 
back home in Illinois to talk about 
what the American Rescue Plan means 
to our State. It is dramatic. Dramatic. 
Millions of dollars will be coming to 
our State to buy vaccines. I can tell 
you, all across Illinois, people are ask-
ing: When is it my turn? When do I get 
my chance? And we want to make sure 
they get that chance sooner rather 
than later. 
Think about what President Biden 
inherited just a few weeks ago. Surely 
they had found some vaccines—excel-
lent vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna— 
approved by then, but he came to the 
White House to find that there was no 
plan to administer those vaccines 
across the Nation. 
Vaccine is important, but it is of lit-
tle value if it is not in the arms of 
Americans. So he set out to establish a 
standard that we would be distributing 
this vaccine across the United States 
as quickly as possible and the mecha-
nism, the infrastructure to make cer-
tain that it was administered by pro-
fessionals who know what they are 
doing. That is quite an undertaking. It 
is the largest vaccination in the his-
tory of our Nation. But President 
Biden said he needed help to do it—not 
just money for the vaccine but money 
for testing, money for the genomic se-
quencing necessary to detect variants 
that might be emerging in the United 
States. That was a major element of 
the bill that passed this Senate last 
Saturday. 
He also put money in there that had 
already been promised to the American 
people. 
Remember 
when 
President 
Trump said $2,000 for every American? 
We agreed on a bipartisan basis. The 
first downpayment was last December, 
$600, and the remainder, $1,400, was in-
cluded in the bill that passed on Satur-
day. 
I have yet to hear a Republican Sen-
ator come to this floor and criticize 
that sum of money. All of them—I 
should say most of them have publicly 
supported it, and others say little or 
nothing about it, but no one is saying 
that it shouldn’t be given as a result of 
the promise made. We kept that prom-
ise. That was part of what we were 
doing. 
We also had a responsibility to mil-
lions of Americans who are still col-
lecting unemployment. As of March 14,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1413 
March 9, 2021 
they were going to lose their oppor-
tunity to continue that unemployment 
check. 
There were arguments made on the 
floor here that these were just lazy 
people and that if you give them an un-
employment check, they will just con-
tinue to be lazy and won’t go back to 
work. I don’t buy that. I don’t believe 
it. Are some lazy? Well, possibly. I 
think the vast majority of these people 
are desperate. They are desperate be-
cause they have been laid off or lost 
their jobs and they need to keep their 
families together. 
Unemployment benefits do that, and 
they also give fuel to the economy to 
recover. We were told that by the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve and 
others—to put enough stimulus back in 
this economy so we can come out of it 
strong sooner rather than later. I be-
lieve that. Yet people like the Repub-
lican Senator from Ohio came to the 
floor talking about the recovery under-
way and we don’t really need to do as 
much as President Biden had asked for. 
I disagree. 
All across the board, the bill that we 
passed, whether it is money for schools 
or money for hospitals or money for 
clinics or money for administering this 
vaccine, was money that will be well 
spent in the State of Illinois and all 
across the United States. 
Now what troubles me is this: Last 
year, we had two major bills for COVID 
relief. They talk about five. There were 
two major bills. The first was in 
March, the CARES Act that was worth 
$2 trillion. That bill passed the Senate 
after it had been engineered by Treas-
ury Secretary Mnuchin of the Trump 
administration. It passed the Senate 
with every Senator voting yes, 96 to 
nothing. Every Democratic Senator 
voted for it. 
Then came the followup bill in De-
cember, some $900 billion for more 
COVID relief, for a temporary, first- 
quarter-of-this-year fix. When you look 
at the final rollcall there, it was 92 to 
6. All six ‘‘no’’ votes were Republicans. 
Every Democrat who voted, voted for 
it—again, a Trump proposal that we 
supported on the Democratic side. 
So then the tables turned on January 
20, and a new President came to town. 
Joe Biden said: Let me finish this and 
do it effectively. Give me an American 
Rescue Plan. 
How 
many 
Republican 
Senators 
stood up and said: Well, since the 
Democrats, in the spirit of responding 
to this pandemic, came around and 
supported the Trump plans last year, 
we will do the same this year. The 
number—zero. Not one Republican Sen-
ator supported the bill that passed on 
Saturday. We passed it with 50 Demo-
cratic votes. That is what it took, with 
one Republican Senator being missing. 
But what a disappointment that is, to 
think that this pandemic and the eco-
nomic crisis that followed was ad-
dressed on a bipartisan basis with 
every Democratic vote in the major 
legislation last year, and this year, 
under President Biden, we couldn’t get 
one Republican Senator to join us in 
that effort. It is a disappointment, but 
I hope it isn’t a portent of things to 
come. We have a lot to do, and we need 
to do it together on a bipartisan basis. 
The American people are going to 
count on us to do it. 
I also might say a word about the 
nominations that Senator MCCONNELL 
referred to earlier. It is true that some 
of these nominees are getting votes 
that indicate a strong majority in sup-
port, and that does evidence Repub-
lican cooperation, and I want to thank 
them for joining us in that bipartisan 
spirit. But it evidences something else 
as well. These are good nominees. 
These are good men and women who 
can serve this country effectively. 
Given the chance, they will, and the 
votes that have been cast in support of 
them indicate that as well. 
I won’t go into the experience 4 years 
ago with the Trump nominees, but 
many of them had troubled records, 
and some of them didn’t even file the 
necessary 
disclosures 
before 
their 
names were submitted to us for consid-
eration. So there are a lot of things 
that have changed in the 4-year period 
of time. Now we have a chance to ap-
prove a team for President Biden and 
to fill out his national security team. 
NOMINATION OF MERRICK BRIAN GARLAND 
Madam President, the last person up 
is Merrick Garland, nominee for Attor-
ney General. He is, simply put, the 
right nominee to lead the Justice De-
partment. I believe that is true for 
three primary reasons: one, his integ-
rity; two, his experience; and three, his 
humility. 
Let me begin with integrity. 
The Attorney General occupies a 
unique role in the Cabinet. Although 
serving at the pleasure of the President 
and responsible for implementing his 
policy initiatives, the Attorney Gen-
eral is also the Nation’s law enforce-
ment officer. 
The AG oversees a Department that 
must remain impartial, unbiased, and 
independent. To balance these two 
roles requires a nominee who is beyond 
reproach, who understands the need to 
separate personal preference from con-
stitutional principles, and who has the 
courage to stand steadfast in the face 
of political pressure. Merrick Garland 
is such a nominee. 
As a judge of the DC Circuit for more 
than 20 years, he has been guided by an 
abiding faith in the rule of law and a 
firm commitment to make equal jus-
tice for all a reality. It is no surprise, 
then, that more than 60 former Federal 
judges and more than 150 former Jus-
tice Department officials, appointed by 
Presidents of both parties, have ex-
pressed their strong support for Judge 
Garland’s nomination. They know that 
Judge Garland will carry his integrity 
and his independence with him in his 
new role, and the public will soon see 
the same integrity and independence in 
the new Department of Justice, a wel-
come change from the past 4 years. 
Judge Garland also has the experi-
ence needed to lead the Department 
from the first day on the job. Before he 
served on the DC Circuit, Judge Gar-
land served with distinction in mul-
tiple Justice Department roles—as a 
special assistant to the Attorney Gen-
eral, assistant U.S. Attorney, a deputy 
in the Criminal Division, and top ad-
viser to the Deputy Attorney General. 
We know, of course, it was Judge 
Merrick Garland who ably and admi-
rably led the investigation and pros-
ecution of the Oklahoma City bomb-
ing—the worst domestic terrorism at-
tack, to date, in modern American his-
tory—and he will, no doubt, draw upon 
that experience as the Department 
brings to justice those who perpetrated 
the hideous January 6 Capitol insurrec-
tion and works to prevent further at-
tacks. 
But as Judge Garland highlighted at 
his hearing, his prior tenure at the De-
partment of Justice has also given him 
insight into what is vital for the De-
partment’s success, from the impor-
tance of career prosecutors and agents 
to the breadth of the Department’s re-
sponsibilities. 
Finally, Judge Garland has what I 
believe to be a characteristic that is 
often overlooked when we evaluate 
nominees: humility. He is mindful of 
the Department’s history, a founding 
rooted in protecting the civil rights en-
shrined in the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
Amendments—and he is mindful of just 
how much work remains in the fight 
for civil rights. 
He is mindful of the enormous power 
that prosecutors hold and the need to 
wield that power responsibly. In fact, 
he told us as much at the hearing when 
he quoted Robert Jackson, the Attor-
ney General and later Supreme Court 
Justice, in saying: 
The citizen’s safety lies in the prosecutor 
who tempers zeal with human kindness, who 
seeks truth and not victims, who serves the 
law and not factional purposes, and who ap-
proaches the task with humility. 
He is mindful of the opportunities 
that this country has provided him yet 
remain elusive for far too many. Presi-
dent Biden nominated Judge Garland 
to serve with a team of senior Justice 
Department leaders. 
Today, we had a hearing with Lisa 
Monaco, who is aspiring to be his Dep-
uty Attorney General; Vanita Gupta, 
who is aspiring to be his Associate At-
torney General; and, later, we will have 
a hearing with Kristen Clarke, who 
wishes to be Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral for Civil Rights. 
This is an exceptionally well-quali-
fied team of DOJ veterans eager to 
serve. When the committee reported 
Judge Garland’s nomination, I am 
happy to report that four Republicans 
joined all the Democrats, making it a 
bipartisan rollcall. I think it is worth 
quoting again. Here is what Judge Gar-
land said: 
I come from a family where my grand-
parents fled anti-Semitism and persecution. 
The country took us in and protected us.

And I feel an obligation to the country to 
pay back, and this is the highest, best use of 
my own set of skills to pay back. 
Judge Garland’s motivation for serv-
ing as the Nation’s next Attorney Gen-
eral is powerful, it is honest, and it is 
humble. 
I want to close by coming full circle, 
so to speak. At Judge Garland’s hear-
ing, I noted that, if confirmed, he 
would be standing on the shoulders of 
predecessors like Robert Kennedy, who 
called on Congress to enact sweeping 
civil rights legislation. Well after that 
hearing, the committee received a let-
ter from over 30 members of the Ken-
nedy family, and they likened what 
faces Judge Garland to what faced the 
young Robert Kennedy as he took up 
his position as Attorney General. They 
wrote—the 
Kennedy 
family—and 
I 
quote: 
We are confronted by the same challenges 
today, particularly in voting rights, in the 
actions of some of our police officers, and in 
great disparities in housing, health, and jobs. 
Merrick Garland’s record shows he is dedi-
cated to the kind of justice that does not 
simply punish but lifts people up so their 
best selves can be fulfilled. 
That is precisely the kind of Attor-
ney General America needs and the 
kind of Attorney General Merrick Gar-
land will be. I look forward to voting 
for him, and I urge all of my colleagues 
to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Ohio. 
NOMINATION OF MARCIA LOUISE FUDGE 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today, I 
urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting another dedicated and talented 
public servant and a great Ohioan—my 
Congresswoman for the last 12 years— 
MARSHA FUDGE, to be our next Sec-
retary of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment. 
Congresswoman FUDGE
is a proud 
daughter of Ohio. She was born in 
Cleveland, grew up in Ohio, and grad-
uated from the Ohio State University 
and Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. 
Congresswoman FUDGE has a long and 
distinguished career serving our State 
in the Cleveland and Cuyahoga County 
courts and Cuyahoga County prosecu-
tors’ office, as chief of staff to the 
trailblazing Stephanie Tubbs Jones, 
and as mayor of Warrensville Heights, 
OH. 
At HUD, Congresswoman FUDGE will 
work to help protect our kids from lead 
poisoning, to restore the promise of 
fair housing, and to give communities 
the help and the resources that they 
need. It is a tall order. It is one she is 
poised to meet. 
She brings to the job the unique and 
critical experience of serving as mayor 
for the kind of community that is ei-
ther overlooked or outright preyed 
upon by Wall Street and by big inves-
tors. She understands we can’t write 
off entire swaths of the country— 
whether it is a coal town in southeast 
Ohio or a historic industrial city like 
the one I grew up in, in Mansfield, or 
whether it is farm country around Lex-
ington, OH, or whether it is an urban 
neighborhood on the East Side of 
Cleveland. 
This champion of Cleveland under-
stands that. She saw up close how lend-
ers preyed on families and the fore-
closure crisis that followed. My col-
leagues have heard me talk about ZIP 
code 44105, where Connie and I live, 
which had more foreclosures in the 
first half of 2007 than any ZIP code in 
the United States. 
At the time, Congresswoman FUDGE 
was serving as mayor of a city fewer 
than 20 miles away. Today, she rep-
resents this ZIP code in the United 
States Congress. Those families are 
more than just a statistic to her. They 
are her constituents. They are her 
neighbors. They are her friends. She 
knows their story. She knows how, for 
decades, communities have watched as 
factories closed, investment dried up, 
and storefronts were boarded over. She 
knows how many neighborhoods and 
towns have never had the investment 
they should—from Black codes to Jim 
Crow, to red lining, to the discrimina-
tion that President Trump’s regulators 
locked into place. She understands how 
decades of policy funneled resources 
and jobs away from Black and Brown 
communities. 
A few years ago, I was talking with 
local health department officials in 
Cleveland. I asked them what percent-
age of the older homes that make up 
the bulk of Cleveland housing have 
dangerous levels of lead, those homes 
built right after World War II or before 
that. They said 99 percent of those 
homes have high levels of lead—dan-
gerously high levels of lead. 
The families in those homes are Con-
gresswoman FUDGE’s constituents. She 
knows what lead poison does to kids. 
She knows the local efforts that Ohio-
ans are leading in Cleveland to take 
this on. She lifts up their voices, which 
have been drowned out or silenced for 
too long. She will be a champion for 
families all over the country who want 
to be able to afford a home without 
crippling stress every single month and 
to be able to build wealth through 
home ownership to pass on to their 
children and grandchildren. 
Congresswoman FUDGE has dedicated 
her career to fighting for Ohioans. I am 
excited she is now going to use all that 
talent and all that passion and all that 
empathy to fight for her whole coun-
try. I ask my colleagues to support her 
confirmation to be Secretary of Hous-
ing and Urban Development. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. President, this weekend, on Sat-
urday, we passed the American Rescue 
Plan that will put shots in people’s 
arms, kids back in school, money in 
people’s pockets, and workers in jobs. 
Tens of millions Americans, including 
more than 5 million Ohioans, are going 
to see money in their pockets from 
stimulus checks and the dramatic ex-
pansion of the earned income tax credit 
and the child tax credit. 
This comes back to, as it always does 
in 
politics—the 
Presiding 
Officer 
knows—as it does in government, and 
it comes down to ‘‘whose side are you 
on?’’ as this illustrates pretty well. 
The American Rescue Plan. We all re-
member—most 
of 
us 
remember—4 
years ago, the Trump tax cut for the 
rich, and the blue here is the American 
Rescue Plan, which we just passed on 
Saturday, which the House will prob-
ably pass tomorrow, and President 
Biden will probably sign it this week-
end. The lowest numbers—the lowest 20 
percent—saw their income go up by 20 
percent under our plan. It is barely per-
ceptible how much it went up under 
the Trump tax plan. But if you go to 
the top of 1 percent, you can see how 
much their income went up, and this is 
to the tune of millions and millions of 
dollars, and the lowest earners essen-
tially got nothing from the Trump tax 
plan. 
So you can see here in the blue is 
how our tax bill will put money in the 
pockets of middle-income people, all 
the way up—middle-income people, 
working-class people, the lowest in-
come people—while the Trump tax 
plan, of course, was helping the richest 
people in the country. 
We see that middle-class and work-
ing-class and low-income families are 
all going to benefit from the American 
Rescue Plan. This is a broad invest-
ment in a whole country—in the vast 
majority of people, who get their in-
come not from a stock portfolio but 
from a paycheck. Contrast that with 
those who benefitted from the McCon-
nell-Trump tax scam. The vast major-
ity of benefits, as we all know, went to 
those at the top. Again, look at the top 
1 percent. They got more from the 
Washington Republican tax giveaway 
than anyone else. 
At the time, I remember—the Pre-
siding Officer, I think, remembers this; 
he opposed that bill vigorously, too— 
Republicans claimed it just wasn’t pos-
sible—to do their tax bill, it wasn’t 
possible—to avoid giving tax cuts to 
the richest 1 percent. They just had to. 
We knew they were wrong then. This 
has proved they are wrong. 
Again, look at the blue and the pur-
ple—the benefits that go to the lowest, 
to middle-class families, working fami-
lies, and low-income families. Our res-
cue plan gave literally zero to the top 
1 percent. They are doing just fine. The 
value of their stock portfolio has 
soared during the pandemic. We in-
vested in everyone else, in the people 
who were promised more money in 
their paychecks from the Republican 
tax scam but never got those raises. 
As I said, 4 million Ohioans will get 
a stimulus check. That is out of 12 mil-
lion people in the State. Two million 
Ohio families will get at least a $3,000 
child tax credit. They will get a 
check—$250 every month year round. 
More than half a million Ohio workers 
will get an expanded earned income tax 
credit. Those childless families—single 
people, childless people, some old, a

number of older Ohioans not yet quite 
65—will get their enhanced earned in-
come tax credit. Over a million deliv-
ery drivers and more than a million 
cashiers will get an income boost, and 
800,000 home health aides get more 
money back in their pockets. 
These 
are 
the 
workers 
on 
the 
frontlines of the pandemic. These are 
the people who go to work every day 
and expose themselves to people whom 
they don’t know, in the course of their 
job. They go home at night anxious 
that they might be infecting their fam-
ilies. This is what making hard work 
pay off looks like. This is what invest-
ing in the country looks like. This is 
what a government on the side of 
workers and their families look like. It 
is about the dignity of work. It is 
about rewarding people that work 
hard. It is what we did on Saturday. It 
is what I said, as I was walking out of 
this building on the way home on Sat-
urday, was the best day of my Senate 
career because we helped tens of mil-
lions of Americans. We helped millions 
of people in my State. We will make a 
difference in their lives. That is what 
we did on Saturday. That is what we 
will continue to do. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
this past Saturday, Senate Democrats 
signed off on the largest and most par-
tisan transfer of wealth in the history 
of the U.S. Congress. 
In the weeks leading up to that vote, 
they insisted that their $1.9 trillion 
giveaway would bring the relief the 
American people were seeking. They 
quoted suspect polling and anecdotes 
to support their ridiculous claims that 
the bill was bipartisan, even though 
they never even tried to secure bipar-
tisan support. In fact, I would argue 
that Democrats threw away the idea of 
bipartisanship the moment they chose 
to use the reconciliation process to 
force their hand. After almost 30 hours 
of debate, they did just that on a 
party-line vote. Then the cracks in 
their claims of bipartisanship and ne-
cessity began to show. 
Almost immediately after the final 
vote, the majority leader called it—and 
I am quoting—‘‘one of the most pro-
gressive pieces of legislation—if not 
the most progressive—in decades.’’ But 
we all know that his definition of ‘‘pro-
gressive’’ isn’t compatible with the 
kind of targeted relief everyone here 
would probably agree that this country 
needs, had my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle not seen an oppor-
tunity to fulfill the radical campaign 
promises that had put them into 
power. They chose—they chose—that 
power over dealing with the needs that 
people have. 
They did what they set out to do. A 
fraction of the American Rescue Plan’s 
$2 trillion pricetag would go toward 
that—and I am quoting again—‘‘big, 
bold, urgent’’ relief that Democrats 
spent all weekend long bragging about. 
I am sure you heard them as you 
turned on the TV. Here is the truth: 
Only 9 percent—9 percent—will go to-
ward vaccines, testing, healthcare jobs; 
9 percent of a nearly $2 trillion bill 
goes for COVID relief. 
But if we want to talk about big, bold 
spending plans, let’s talk about all 
those special earmarks and sweetheart 
deals that Democrats used to take ad-
vantage of the situation and seize even 
more power—again, after the power, 
using people as pawns to get their lib-
eral wish list, get the money in the 
pipeline. Of course, you can forget that 
we had $1 trillion already in the pipe-
line that had not been spent, also put-
ting their desired power ahead of our 
children and grandchildren who are 
going to have to pay that debt. Im-
moral. 
In my office, we call this bill the blue 
State bailout. We do it for a reason. 
You can look at this chart. Along with 
that laughable 9 percent of actual 
COVID relief, the American people 
took on $350 billion in debt to cover a 
bailout for some of the highest spend-
ing and most poorly managed State 
and local governments in the country. 
The number is astronomically higher 
than even the most extreme estimates 
of need conjured up by leftwing think 
tanks. It is more than the $31 billion 
loss in expected tax revenue that ex-
perts forecasted. And it doesn’t even 
take into consideration that many 
States don’t need a bailout. Many 
States had success putting those five 
previous bipartisan COVID relief pack-
ages to work. They caught up on their 
tax revenue with time to spare. 
But, still, that $350 billion, it served 
a purpose. You can see it right here. 
The blue States, they are getting more 
money. The red States, they are losing 
money. It created yet another expecta-
tion of dependency that mismanaged 
States and local governments can lean 
on when their out-of-control spending 
policies come back to bite them. 
And we have learned today that the 
majority leader had a staff member 
who tweeted out that the money from 
this bill, it would tend to New York 
State’s deficit—pretty much the same 
thing we are hearing from California 
and from some of the big blue cities. If 
you can’t control your spending habits, 
crank up the printing presses. 
The payday continued with an $85 
billion 
no-strings-attached 
pension 
bailout that everyone from the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et to the editorial board of the Wall 
Street Journal, to the editorial board 
of the Washington Post agree had noth-
ing to do with COVID relief—nothing. 
It was a gift to an embattled constitu-
ency and another pernicious assertion 
that when the going gets tough and the 
money in those mismanaged funds 
evaporates, just call on the Federal 
Government and crank up the printing 
presses one more time. Why? Oh, we 
need the money. We cannot manage 
our budgets. We are running low on ful-
filling our obligation to the pension 
fund. Oh, my goodness, we have so 
many needs. 
Everybody has needs. Our children 
and our grandchildren have needs. 
They need freedom. They need Mem-
bers of the Senate, Members of the 
House to act like adults and address 
the problems that are right in front of 
us. 
When President Biden asked, back in 
February, what would they have me 
cut from this spending bill, I would 
have told him, let’s start with this 
money. Let’s start with the money 
that is going to the States to bail them 
out because yes, indeed, this is now the 
Biden blue State bailout. 
Democrats’ desire for a lawless and 
open border shone through in their 
unanimous refusal to accept an amend-
ment that would have kept billions of 
dollars in direct payments out of the 
hands of illegal immigrants. This was 
more than just a handout; it was a sig-
nal to every person who is trying to 
jump the line and break the rules that 
we will not only tolerate it, but now we 
are encouraging it. Think about that. 
Think about that. 
The rule of law is out the window. We 
are willing to chip away at our own se-
curity—the Democrats are—and ignore 
the growing crisis at our southern bor-
der—the Democrats are. And if it 
means we can slap a bandaid on what 
has become a gaping wound and call it 
a win in the war against poverty, the 
Democrats are OK with doing that. It 
is called spin. But it does not address 
the underlying issues. It doesn’t ad-
dress the fact that they are doing this 
at the expense of schools, small busi-
nesses, and families. 
Democrats 
certainly 
followed 
through on their campaign promise to 
empower teachers unions. In fact, they 
went so far as to approve a provision 
that would pay schools to stay closed. 
All 50 Democrats voted against an 
amendment that would have sent new 
funding only to schools that have fol-
lowed the science and have reopened 
safely. 
You know, you would have thought 
that the Democrats would have at least 
done that for the children. But, no. In 
addition to saddling them with debt— 
another $2 trillion worth of debt—they 
encouraged the teachers unions to not 
go back to school. That vote put the 
power right where the Democrats want 
it—in the hands of the unions. And mil-
lions of students and teachers out 
there will continue to pay the mental 
and emotional price for this action. 
This bill took so much from people 
who have absolutely nothing to give. 
Think of all those billions of dollars 
wasted on unnecessary State bailouts, 
pension rescues, and union appease-
ment. We had the opportunity to spend 
that money on vaccine distribution and

small business relief and a light at the 
end of the tunnel for rural healthcare 
systems that are hanging on by a 
thread. 
So why did Democrats throw so much 
money at their pet projects? Do they 
really owe that many favors and pay-
backs? They certainly didn’t pour their 
time and energy into those 600 pages to 
provide relief but to shamelessly ad-
vance their own agenda and throw 
aside struggling families and workers. 
Struggling families and workers were 
simply the price for getting the power 
that the Democrats wanted. 
When I talk to Tennesseans about 
what happened in this Chamber last 
week, I tell them: You are right about 
what you were seeing as you watched 
the proceedings. You are right. Demo-
crats took advantage of you, of your 
desperation and your exhaustion. They 
used 
slick 
messaging 
and 
wordy 
phrases to sell a bill of goods that 
treats every pet project they have and 
every liberal wish list agenda item as 
essential. 
They like changing the rules. They 
change the meaning of words like ‘‘es-
sential’’ because they knew that if 
they could make everything that they 
wanted essential, they could take all 
the power away from local, responsible 
governments. They could take it away 
from school districts and small busi-
nesses. And do you know what they are 
doing with it? They are going to cen-
tralize it. 
See, here is the thing: You were es-
sential to their greedy power grab. 
They had to have you. 
They had to give their bill a nice- 
sounding name. They had to say cer-
tain things were essential, but you— 
small businesses, families, people who 
are playing by the rules, you were not 
essential to them. 
See, 
that 
is 
what 
‘‘progressive’’ 
means to Senate Democrats, and if we 
continue along this road, you are right; 
it will be an absolute unmitigated dis-
aster for every single person that my 
colleagues across the aisle have used as 
leverage 
against 
responsible 
policy 
that will actually bring us out of this 
pandemic. 
No, it is not about getting out of the 
pandemic. It is about power, the power 
that they want. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
FREE SPEECH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
have spoken on the Senate floor re-
cently on the subject of free speech as 
it applies to the world of digital media. 
The principles of free speech are time-
less and are applicable to new forms of 
communication. Still, it is natural 
that new questions will arise and new 
mechanisms might be needed to apply 
those principles across new modes of 
communication. 
What shouldn’t be in question is the 
need for open dialogue and freedom of 
speech in academia. Otherwise, what 
does the principle of academic freedom 
mean if it isn’t involved with freedom 
of speech? 
All of the progress that has made 
modern life possible has been the result 
of individuals who have been able to 
think of things in new ways, even if 
that challenged an old orthodoxy. A 
healthy and vibrant academic environ-
ment is not afraid of those challenges. 
Only 
stagnant, 
defensive, 
and 
unconfident regimes suppress speech. 
Think about the recent protests in 
Russia, Belarus, or Burma. China’s re-
strictions on the internet and suppres-
sion of minorities show that it is 
threatened by contrary ways of think-
ing. 
Which would you describe as an ad-
vanced, stable, and dynamic society: 
North Korea or South Korea? Obvi-
ously, that describes South Korea well. 
It does not at all describe that part of 
the Korean Peninsula north of the 38th 
parallel. 
So what does it say about so many 
American academic institutions that 
the notion of free thought and free 
speech has now become controversial? 
What purpose do universities serve if 
one of the purposes is not to discuss 
controversial subjects? I often say my 
definition of a university is where con-
troversy runs rampant. 
We hear lots of rationales about why 
the current generation of college stu-
dents needs to be protected from hear-
ing speech that could be offensive, 
hateful, or just plain wrong. Of course, 
none of us support hateful speech. I 
don’t support it, but I do support free-
dom. 
If you empower those in authority to 
limit hate speech, whether they be col-
lege administrators or government of-
ficials, that power will eventually be 
abused to limit dissenting points of 
view of all kinds, and that is where 
some universities are right now. 
Even in Iowa’s three public univer-
sities, we have seen recent efforts to 
shut down mainstream, center-right 
views. For instance, a dean at the Uni-
versity of Iowa sent an email across a 
university 
platform 
criticizing 
a 
Trump administrative Executive order, 
but at that same university, when a 
student challenged the position of the 
dean using the very same medium, the 
student was threatened with discipli-
nary action. 
Well, the dean has since apologized 
for his initial handling of the subject, 
so I don’t raise that to pick on him. In 
fact, that very dean has befriended me 
in very many ways and in thoughtful 
ways as well. But it just makes you 
wonder if it is part of a broader cul-
tural trend in academia, what went on 
in that instance at the University of 
Iowa. 
Then there was an English professor 
at Iowa State University who had to be 
reprimanded for banning her students 
from writing papers expressing certain 
viewpoints such as opposition to abor-
tion or same-sex marriage. The presi-
dent of my alma mater, the University 
of Northern Iowa, had to step in to re-
verse a decision by the student senate 
denying a group of pro-life students 
student organization status purely be-
cause of their political views. 
In each case, the university adminis-
trations of these three universities ul-
timately resolved these incidents well 
and properly so. I mention them not to 
pick on my State of Iowa’s universities 
and not to criticize any university, for 
that matter, but because they seem to 
be examples of a broader trend on cam-
puses across the country of a knee-jerk 
reaction to shut down speech some find 
disagreeable. 
The best response to the expression 
of views that you find repugnant is 
speech that points out the errors of 
that particular way of thinking. Now, I 
think that is best expressed by the Uni-
versity of Chicago’s policy, which has 
become kind of a gold standard for free 
speech advocacy on university cam-
puses. The University of Chicago ex-
pressly prohibits obstructing or other-
wise interfering with freedom of others 
to express views they reject or even 
loathe. 
If you are confident in the rightness 
of your views and you have an environ-
ment that allows free expression of 
those views, you need not fear speech 
you find wrong. Of course, that as-
sumes that human beings are all gifted 
with the power of reason and can dis-
cern what is right. 
Now, if it happens that that is not 
the case, if people cannot be trusted to 
listen to different views and come to 
the right conclusion, then there is no 
basis for democracy and our system of 
self-government, then, is fundamen-
tally flawed. 
You can shield students from hearing 
challenging and uncomfortable views 
while in college but not when they get 
out in the real world. Just think of 
these college students who are on cam-
pus. What if they had left high school 
for the world of work? They would be 
faced with all these things every day. 
So what is special about a college 
campus? In fact, it is so special that 
you ought to have a discussion of all 
these subjects. Academic institutions 
that do not allow for student views to 
be challenged, to be tested, to be re-
fined through rigorous debate are doing 
those very same students a very great 
disservice. These students’ knowledge 
will be limited, then, and their views 
unsophisticated. Their ability to deal 
with different ways of thinking, which 
they 
will 
inevitably 
encounter 
throughout 
their 
lifetime, 
will 
be 
greatly diminished. 
I feel sorry for students who graduate 
from colleges that cocoon them from 
controversy. Let me repeat what I said 
at 
the 
beginning. 
I 
have 
always 
thought of a university as a place 
where controversy should run rampant. 
The notion that the voices students 
hear must be curated for their own 
good is concerning, not just because it 
has a totalitarian ring but because it is 
harming students in the long run, when 
they have to deal with the real world.

If students are showing up on campus 
unable to cope emotionally with hear-
ing conflicting viewpoints, that is a 
problem of their upbringing and edu-
cation to that point, before they go to 
that university. It is something col-
leges need to confront head-on for their 
students’ well-being. Further shielding 
students from having their views chal-
lenged and then sending them out in 
the world thinking they are prepared is 
a recipe for failure. 
Americans seem to be losing the abil-
ity to understand the point of view of 
those with whom they disagree. That is 
an unrealistic point of view for Ameri-
cans to have. It is a failure to teach 
about freedom. Questioning of motives 
has 
replaced 
principled 
argument. 
Shouting insults has displaced logical 
debate. 
Don’t you see, this is a societal trend 
that increasingly is reflected in the 
Halls of Congress—right here. Those 
who have attended institutions of high-
er education should have to be exposed 
to the great thinkers of the past and 
the present, be able to argue points 
logically, and, more importantly, un-
derstand the points of those whom they 
are trying to persuade or refute. 
College graduates should be models 
of civil discourse. Instead, they are too 
often the vanguard of the closing of the 
American mind. For the sake of their 
students and for the benefit of society, 
I urge college administrators, trustees, 
alumni, and all Americans who value 
the free exchange of ideas to work to-
ward reversing this trend. 
Open debate may seem contentious 
at times, but it is the only path toward 
mutual understanding, which is so 
needed right now in American society, 
our less-than-civil American society, 
which that less-than-civil American so-
ciety tends to show up in a democracy 
that has representative government 
where, if you are really going to have 
representative government, wouldn’t 
you expect some of what is happening 
at the grassroots to show up here in 
the Halls of Congress? And we do see it 
all the time, to our shame. 
NOMINATION OF MERRICK BRIAN GARLAND 
Mr. President, on another subject, 
today the Senate will start consider-
ation of Judge Merrick Garland’s nomi-
nation to be Attorney General of the 
United States. 
I will be supporting his nomination, 
but, as I said at Garland’s hearing be-
fore the Judiciary Committee, I have 
concerns, and I am here now to repeat 
those concerns so all of my colleagues 
can hear them. 
I hope he will take these concerns se-
riously, and I will work with members 
of the Judiciary Committee to conduct 
thorough oversight of the Department 
of Justice in order to make sure the 
Department is being run independently 
and free from political influence. 
On paper, I don’t think anyone would 
doubt Judge Garland is a good pick to 
lead the Department of Justice. 
His credentials are excellent, and he 
has a distinguished career of public 
service, including all of those long 
years he has been on the DC Circuit 
Court of Appeals. Of all the possibili-
ties to be President Biden’s Attorney 
General, it is hard to come up with a 
better pick. 
The top law enforcement officer of 
the United States must be committed 
to enforcing the rule of law, and he 
made it very clear that that is what he 
was going to do. As our former col-
league John Ashcroft said—and he was 
Attorney General, you know, early in 
the George W. Bush administration— 
the Department of Justice is the only 
Cabinet Agency whose name is an 
ideal. It is not the Department of Law 
Enforcement but the Department of 
Justice. Justice is equality under the 
law. There is one law for all Americans 
regardless of race, color, creed, or po-
litical affiliation. 
It is our founding principle that all 
people are created equal. My hope is 
that Judge Garland agrees with that 
principle, and he does, but he has got 
to be careful to make sure the Justice 
Department runs accordingly. 
That is not how it has always been, 
however. And I don’t want to say that 
is how it has always been under just 
Democrat Presidents; it probably has 
been that way under Republican Presi-
dents too. But I don’t think it is how it 
was run more recently during the 
Obama years. 
Here is what I don’t want to see 
Judge Garland do—and all of my col-
leagues at the time heard this: The At-
torney General then, Eric Holder, fa-
mously said that he was a ‘‘wingman’’ 
to the President. I don’t want an Attor-
ney General who takes tarmac meet-
ings with President Clinton while she 
is investigating his wife. I don’t want 
consent decrees that federalize law en-
forcement and cause murder rates to 
soar. I don’t want the Civil Rights Di-
vision trying to stop school choice in 
Louisiana. I don’t want a return to 
catch and release. I don’t want Oper-
ation Choke Point, where the Depart-
ment of Justice decides that gun stores 
don’t get access to banking services. 
I am concerned about the Justice De-
partment’s direction before Judge Gar-
land is even confirmed. These are some 
of the directions. They changed litiga-
tion positions on a number of high-pro-
file cases in court, including on immi-
gration, 
affirmative 
action, 
ObamaCare, and other issues. 
This is what a very famous Solicitor 
General, Paul Clement, said: ‘‘It has 
been the long-term position of the Jus-
tice Department to defend the con-
stitutionality of statutes whenever 
reasonable arguments can be made.’’ 
It appears that our new President 
and his administration are going to 
flout that tradition. I just stated how 
Paul Clement felt about it. I hope that 
Judge Garland brings that point of 
view in line and preserves the credi-
bility of the Justice Department. 
I hope he also preserves his credi-
bility with the Durham investigation. 
During the Trump administration, I 
supported the Mueller investigation. I 
even supported legislation to protect 
his investigation in 2018 when it looked 
like President Trump might fire him. 
That bill got out of the committee that 
I chaired at that time. 
In 2019, when Bill Barr was before the 
Judiciary Committee, he was required 
to commit to not interfere with the 
Mueller investigation. And I thought 
that was appropriate. 
Now we have another special counsel 
investigation, this one run by John 
Durham, a respected career prosecutor 
who is investigating the Crossfire Hur-
ricane investigation, in which members 
of the Obama administration spied on 
and prosecuted members of the Trump 
campaign. 
As 
a 
Republican 
who 
supported 
Mueller, I think it is obvious that 
Judge Garland should have made that 
same 
commitment 
at 
the 
hearing 
about Durham that Bill Barr made 
about Mueller when he was before the 
same 
committee 
for 
confirmation. 
Judge Garland was given multiple op-
portunities to do so during his hearing 
and had written questions for the 
record, but every time he declined to 
do so unequivocally. He has implied 
that he won’t interfere with the Dur-
ham investigation, and I take him at 
his word. But it would have been better 
if he had been very clear about it be-
fore the committee. 
So, further clarification, it is Judge 
Garland’s credibility that is on the 
line. If Durham is fired for anything 
other than cause, we will know why 
Judge Garland refused to give us a 
commitment like Barr gave us a com-
mitment when we asked for it. 
Lastly, I want to make a point about 
how Judge Garland’s nomination went 
through the Judiciary Committee. Re-
publicans called two witnesses, two of 
whom supported Judge Garland’s con-
firmation. Republicans also decided 
not to do the usual holdover of one 
week of Judge Garland’s nomination, 
allowing him to be reported to the 
floor a week early. Judge Garland also 
received bipartisan support in the com-
mittee. 
It happens that none of these cour-
tesies were extended to either of Presi-
dent Trump’s nominees to be Attorney 
General, one of whom was a colleague 
of ours here in the Senate and one of 
whom had already held the job before. 
I say all of this to make a point more 
to the media than to my colleagues be-
cause the media seemingly refuses to 
cover these points of bipartisanship 
that we didn’t get from the Democrats 
in the previous administration. After 
the last 4 years of unprecedented ob-
struction of nominees, I think Repub-
licans would have been justified to 
make this confirmation a drawn-out 
process. But we did not do that. 
I don’t plan on opposing nominees 
just because of the person who nomi-
nated them like many of my col-
leagues, unfortunately, did in the last 4 
years. 
So even though I still have some con-
cerns, I believe Judge Garland is a good

person, particularly a good person for 
this job, to lead the Department of Jus-
tice. So I will vote for his confirma-
tion. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Mr. 
President, 
it 
doesn’t seem like that long ago—it 
wasn’t; it was only January 20 of this 
year—that we heard President Biden 
talk about healing the divisions in our 
country 
and 
promoting 
unity. 
He 
promised to restore respectful, bipar-
tisan communication and cooperation. 
He spoke eloquently, saying: 
Without unity there is no peace, only bit-
terness and fury. 
No progress, only exhausting outrage. 
No nation, only a state of chaos. 
It really was a fine speech. But here 
we are, 7 weeks into the Biden adminis-
tration with a lot of bitterness and 
fury and outrage over the President’s 
first big, broken promise. On Saturday 
afternoon, following an all-night vot-
ing marathon, our Democratic col-
leagues passed, by themselves, their so- 
called COVID–19 relief bill. 
Sadly, the lack of bipartisan support 
was not a surprise. After all, our Demo-
cratic colleagues decided to abuse the 
reconciliation process for this very rea-
son. They wanted to pass a bill they 
knew would not generate any support 
among Republicans because it really is 
a Trojan horse for their liberal wish 
list. And the only way they could make 
that happen would be to exclude Re-
publicans, turn down offers of biparti-
sanship, as the President did when 10 
Republicans visited him at the White 
House just a few weeks ago and decided 
to go it alone, which is what our Demo-
cratic colleagues did. 
Since Republicans had no say in the 
drafting of the bill and because our 
Democratic friends chose to skip the 
normal committee consideration, our 
only opportunity to make any changes 
to the bill came through the amend-
ment process on the floor. From rough-
ly 11 a.m. on Friday until 12:30 p.m. on 
Saturday, the Senate voted on more 
than 30 amendments, largely from 
folks on our side of the aisle, almost all 
of which were rejected in a party-line 
vote. 
Outside of Washington, DC, not many 
people stay up for 24 hours straight to 
watch Congress vote on budget amend-
ments, so I think it is important that 
we recap what the American people 
missed while they were sleeping. 
The first amendment vote last Fri-
day was a good barometer of what was 
happening on the other side of the 
aisle. The first vote, teed up by the 
chairman of the Budget Committee, 
Senator SANDERS, would have more 
than doubled the minimum wage at $15 
an hour. The Congressional Budget Of-
fice said that this would kill 1.4 million 
jobs, and then the Senate Parliamen-
tarian said that this was an improper 
use of the budget reconciliation proc-
ess. 
But our Democratic colleagues want-
ed to take this shot anyway, so they 
voted to waive a budget point of order, 
but it did not go well. Eight Democrats 
voted alongside all Republicans to pre-
vent this abuse of the budget reconcili-
ation process and prevent this job-kill-
ing minimum wage mandate from be-
coming part of this bill. 
As it turns out, there is bipartisan 
opposition to killing jobs at a time 
when our economy is already on a frag-
ile footing. Who would have thought 
otherwise? 
And once Senators cast their votes, 
our Democratic friends held the vote 
open for a recordbreaking 12 hours as 
they tried to whip their caucus into 
shape on the most critical amendment, 
which was next in line. 
I am not one to tell our friends 
across the aisle how to do their job, but 
normally, when you have a vote, you 
know ahead of time how that vote is 
going to come out. That is just legisla-
tion 101. But when you are trying to 
rush, at warp speed, a nearly $2 trillion 
wish list to the President’s desk, I 
guess you don’t have the time to do 
things the right way, and you certainly 
don’t have an interest in getting them 
done in a bipartisan fashion. 
But on the rest of the votes we held, 
over and over again, our Democratic 
colleagues held together and blocked 
commonsense amendments offered by 
this side of the aisle. For example, 
there were amendments to stop blue 
States from receiving more than their 
fair share of the State and local fund-
ing. The Democratic proposal includes 
a jaw-dropping $350 billion for State 
and local aid—more than double what 
was spent in the CARES Act last 
March when the economic picture was 
far more dire. 
Unlike the CARES Act funding that 
was distributed based on population, 
this proposal separated the funds into 
two pots of money—one to be distrib-
uted based on a population formula 
while the second is based on the unem-
ployment rate. 
Senator GRAHAM from South Caro-
lina 
offered 
an 
amendment 
which 
would have required this funding to fol-
low the same formula that we did in 
March, in a bipartisan way, rather 
than this new formula that favors blue 
States. 
Since the primary argument for the 
bill was that States needed this fund-
ing because of lost tax revenues, it 
made sense that the largest population 
States should receive the most funding, 
a per capita formula. This would elimi-
nate a big windfall for blue States that 
have largely kept their economies on 
ice and shuttered, even as COVID–19 
cases decreased. 
Then there was an amendment from 
the Senator from Utah, Senator ROM-
NEY, which would have ensured State 
and local funding was only going to 
those States that actually need it. 
What a concept. His amendment would 
require States to apply for aid through 
the Treasury Department. They could 
then receive funds to help recover pan-
demic-related expenses, revenue losses, 
or unexpected Medicaid costs. But, of 
course, in a party-line vote, our Demo-
cratic colleagues blocked that amend-
ment as well. 
And it is not just State and local 
funding that folks on my side of the 
aisle wanted us to use more respon-
sibly. I offered an amendment to im-
prove the quality of care for unaccom-
panied migrant children who arrived 
along the U.S.-Mexico border. We know 
that these children are especially vul-
nerable and their health and safety 
should have been addressed in this 
COVID package. 
Well, President Biden’s border crisis 
is shaping up to be one of epic propor-
tions. Border agents reportedly de-
tained nearly 100,000 migrants along 
the southern border last month alone. 
That marks the highest total for the 
month of February since 2006. The 
numbers have now climbed so high that 
the administration is allowing facili-
ties to house children to operate at 100 
percent capacity, when our kids aren’t 
even going back to school in many 
school districts around the country be-
cause of concerns for their safety. For-
get that. The Biden administration is 
now 
allowing 
these 
facilities 
that 
house children to operate at 100 per-
cent despite the COVID risk. 
An amendment I offered would redi-
rect unnecessary funding for the Na-
tional Endowment for the Humanities 
and instead send it to the Office of Ref-
ugee Resettlement. This office is part 
of the Department of Health and 
Human Services, and this extra funding 
would help keep these children safe and 
healthy. Unfortunately, for these chil-
dren, many of whom have endured long 
and dangerous journeys in the hands of 
human smugglers, our Democratic col-
leagues chose the National Endowment 
for the Humanities instead of these 
children in distress. 
Well, the list of rejected amendments 
goes on and on. 
Senator SCOTT of South Carolina of-
fered an amendment to ensure States 
weren’t fudging on the nursing home 
death count totals, like the disastrous 
situation developing in New York that 
we are just now learning about the 
magnitude of nursing home deaths that 
were covered up by the Cuomo adminis-
tration. This amendment would have 
required States to certify the accuracy 
of COVID–19 deaths in nursing homes 
in order to assess funding for nursing 
home facility strike teams. Once again, 
a party-line vote blocked that amend-
ment. 
One of the highlights of this long and 
drawn-out process, which just left me 
scratching my head, was an amend-
ment from Senator CASSIDY, the Sen-
ator from Louisiana, that would have 
prevented stimulus checks being sent

to people in prison and one from Sen-
ator CRUZ, my colleague from Texas, 
that would have stopped payments 
from going to people who are not even 
legally present in the United States. 
Both amendments were blocked in a 
party-line vote by Democrats. 
Our colleague from Florida, Senator 
RUBIO, 
offered 
an 
amendment 
to 
incentivize a safe return to in-person 
learning at our Nation’s schools. The 
crux of it was simple: If schools wanted 
Federal funding, they should actually 
educate children in the classroom and 
do so safely, according to CDC guide-
lines; otherwise, why do they need this 
huge amount of extra money if they 
are not actually going to use it to edu-
cate our children? Well, our Demo-
cratic colleagues blocked that amend-
ment too. 
While Americans were sleeping, Sen-
ate Democrats stood in the way of nu-
merous commonsense reforms to this 
behemoth of a partisan bill. They have 
proven, 
once 
again, 
this 
so-called 
COVID–19 relief bill has next to noth-
ing to do with what is best for the 
country and everything to do with 
what is best for their liberal partisan 
agenda. 
This bill includes a long list of lib-
eral priorities that are completely un-
related to the crisis at hand. I think 
roughly 90 percent of it is unrelated to 
COVID–19. 
Blank 
checks 
for 
mis-
managed union pension funds, funding 
for climate justice—whatever that is— 
backdoor money for Planned Parent-
hood, an exclusive paid leave program 
for bureaucrats, those are just some of 
the greatest hits in the vote-arama. 
Even the portions of the bill that are 
related to the pandemic are completely 
out of proportion. The legislation pro-
vides $130 billion for schools when tens 
of billions of dollars that we have al-
ready appropriated last December re-
main to be spent. 
According to the Congressional Budg-
et Office, only $6.4 billion will be dis-
tributed through September of this 
year. The remaining $122 billion would 
trickle out the door through not just 
2021 but through 2028. 
Of course, there is the blue State 
bailout. Despite the fact that tax reve-
nues have largely rebounded and many 
States are still sitting on piles of cash 
from previous COVID–19 relief bills, our 
Democratic friends want to send an-
other $350 billion to State and local 
governments but not just on an equi-
table population-based formula. They 
rigged the formula to make sure blue 
States reap the biggest cash benefits. 
We know this wasn’t the only path 
forward. We worked, time and time 
again, this last year on five different 
occasions to show we can unite to pro-
vide COVID–19 relief to the American 
people. 
We could have built on that record 
this year, which after listening to 
President Biden’s inaugural speech, I 
had hoped we might do. The first legis-
lation to pass during the Biden admin-
istration could have been a bipartisan 
pandemic relief bill with overwhelming 
support. We wouldn’t have needed to go 
through the vote-arama or the abuse of 
the budget reconciliation process. We 
could have had a bill that supported 
the hardest hit families, got kids back 
at school, and helped expedite vaccina-
tion. 
But those types of policies, obvi-
ously, weren’t top of mind for our 
Democratic friends. They wanted to 
have a payday for the most radical ele-
ment of their party at an absurdly high 
pricetag, which our children and grand-
children are going to be saddled with. 
They assembled a laundry list of un-
related wasteful and downright par-
tisan provisions and rejected even the 
most commonsense amendments of-
fered by this side of the aisle. 
Sadly, this legislation passed the 
House without a single Republican 
vote. It passed the Senate without a 
single Republican vote. And now, our 
Democratic friends are on track to 
write a $2 trillion check completely 
funded by deficit spending without 
even a trace of bipartisanship. 
They don’t have a figleaf to hide be-
hind. This was a partisan bill inten-
tionally. Either the President sold 
snake oil on Inauguration Day or he 
has already caved into the most radical 
elements of his own political party. Ei-
ther way, it is bad news for the Amer-
ican people. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
today I am going to talk about the 
growing crisis on our southern border 
and how we need urgent action to ad-
dress the degrading situation there, 
but before I begin, I want to say a 
quick word about the reconciliation 
bill we passed last week. 
The massive $1.9 trillion bill was not 
COVID–19 relief; it was liberal relief. 
Everybody and everyone needs to un-
derstand what this was. It was not a 
rescue plan. It was a heist of taxpayers’ 
money. We don’t have $1.9 trillion to be 
spending. When we have to borrow this 
much money, we are digging our coun-
try deeper into debt. And with this 
massive spending bill, we are bor-
rowing against our grandkids’ future 
and are going to owe more and more 
countries like China. 
To keep up, the money supply will 
have to increase at such a rapid rate, it 
could potentially spark inflation. That 
means we could see the value of Ameri-
cans’ hard-earned dollars plummet. 
To further underscore that point, 
that means your money doesn’t go as 
far. For the items you buy, it is very 
expensive. All of this bogs down our 
economy and hinders future growth. 
What is more, this entire sham of a 
process was partisan. It was not about 
helping 
Americans, 
businesses, 
and 
communities recover from the pan-
demic. That much is clear because only 
9 percent of the bill is going to COVID 
and health-related pressures and less 
than 1 percent is going to vaccines. The 
remaining 90 percent went to progres-
sive wish list items for bailouts for 
poorly run States. 
Instead of ramming through non- 
COVID-related 
spending, 
Democrats 
should have worked together with Re-
publicans as a team to pass a bipar-
tisan bill that actually makes lives 
better as we recover from this pan-
demic. 
We share a goal of helping the Amer-
ican people, but the bill that was ulti-
mately put forward failed to do just 
that. It is a shame. This is not how our 
country should be run. 
f 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. President, we started to see 
headlines bubbling up about the build-
ing crisis at the southern border that is 
threatening to boil over. Americans 
back home are paying attention. They 
are watching what is going on and see-
ing how it is getting worse by the day. 
The saddest thing is that this was pre-
dictable and preventable. 
Protecting our border and cutting 
down illegal immigration matters to 
the people of Alabama and the rest of 
the country. Alabamians are law-abid-
ing people. We play by the rules, and 
we expect others to follow them too. 
When people break the rules, they have 
to face the consequences, plain and 
simple. That is how our country should 
operate, by law and order. 
Enforcing the laws on our books can-
not be an option. Sadly, this type of se-
lected enforcement is exactly what 
President Biden has done during his 
short time in office. President Biden 
has put forward an immigration pro-
posal that would completely upend our 
existing immigration policy and give 
out American citizenship like it is 
candy. 
But before that, he made sure to lay 
the groundwork with Executive orders. 
President Biden quickly reversed many 
of President Trump’s most successful 
border control policies with the stroke 
of his pen. And his Secretary of Home-
land Security, whose Department over-
sees immigration policy and border se-
curity, has made it clear he is not in-
terested in enforcing existing laws. We 
have seen the dangerous effects of 
President Biden’s policies already, and 
it has barely been 2 months. 
But we have also seen some mixed 
messaging. The same day President 
Biden issued an order that said build-
ing a border wall is a ‘‘waste of money 
that diverts attention from genuine 
threats to our homeland security,’’ his 
Department of Homeland Security re-
leased official data that tells other-
wise. In January 2021, U.S. Customs 
and Border Patrol Protection encoun-
tered approximately 78,000 illegal im-
migrants, a 6-percent increase from De-
cember 
2020. 
Within 
that 
number, 
roughly, 64,800 were single adults, a 157- 
percent increase compared to January 
of last year. For unaccompanied chil-
dren, there has been a 91-percent in-
crease in apprehensions compared to 
last January.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1420 
March 9, 2021 
The data shows the number of illegal 
immigrants trying to cross the south-
ern border is going up during a month 
when, historically, apprehensions are 
low. In fact, the staggering number of 
people arrested crossing the border il-
legally this January is the most any 
January has seen in more than a dec-
ade. 
In March 2020, President Trump in-
voked title 42 along the southern bor-
der. That means that, in the interest of 
public health, only essential travelers 
are permitted to enter the United 
States. President Biden has maintained 
title 42 for this purpose, with one ex-
ception: Unaccompanied children can 
still come in. 
News outlets reported that border of-
ficials told President Biden they ‘‘an-
ticipate 117,000 children will arrive at 
the U.S.-Mexico border without a par-
ent or guardian in 2021.’’ Why? Because 
President Biden has given them a free 
pass to enter the United States. This 
number is on pace to exceed the all-
time record that was set under the 
Obama administration by 45 percent. 
The greater problem here is that the 
administration doesn’t have enough 
space to put these children. President 
Biden was recently briefed on a plan to 
add 20,000 more beds to meet the needs. 
Yet, yesterday, news reports showed a 
record number of unaccompanied chil-
dren—more than 3,200—are in Border 
Patrol’s custody. Almost half of these 
children have been held beyond the 3- 
day legal limit. The facilities are over-
whelmed and bursting at the seams. 
Folks in the Southwest are already re-
ferring to this increase as the ‘‘Biden 
effect.’’ 
Now Secretary of Homeland Security 
Mayorkas has the gall to blame the 
current border crisis on the Trump ad-
ministration. So why, then, does the 
Secretary think that new records are 
being set during the typical off months 
of January and February? I will tell 
you why. It is a direct result of Presi-
dent Biden ditching border security 
measures and sending a ‘‘come one, 
come all’’ signal. President Biden de-
cided to message to the world that our 
border is open. We shouldn’t be sur-
prised that people showed up. We all 
saw this coming, and we warned that 
reversing President Trump’s policies 
would lead to national security and hu-
manitarian crises. 
On top of all of this, President 
Biden’s administration is subjecting 
American citizens to more stringent 
standards to enter our country than it 
is with illegal immigrants. On January 
26, the CDC began requiring anyone fly-
ing to the United States, including 
American citizens, to provide evidence 
of a negative COVID test taken within 
3 days of their flight. That makes 
sense. Migrants crossing our border are 
not subject to the same requirement. 
I sent a letter to Secretary Mayorkas 
about this issue, and I have not yet re-
ceived a response, but media reports 
out of Texas seem to have already 
found the answer. As FoxNews.com re-
ported, more than 100 illegal immi-
grants 
released 
by 
Border 
Patrol 
agents in Brownsville, TX, in the last 
few weeks have tested positive for the 
coronavirus. So these folks can cross 
the border illegally and get tested by 
the city at the bus stop where the 
agents let them off, but the city has no 
authority to prevent them from trav-
eling elsewhere even if they test posi-
tive for COVID. How does that fit into 
President Biden’s plan to bring our 
country out of this pandemic? Amer-
ican citizens have to prove they have 
negative tests to enter the country, 
but illegal immigrants do not. 
At a time when the virus is on the re-
treat, thanks in large part to the vac-
cine developed by President Trump’s 
Operation Warp Speed, we cannot now 
afford to allow thousands and thou-
sands of illegal immigrants into the 
country, especially without screening 
them for COVID. It is not only a reck-
less security policy; it is a reckless 
health policy. We just spent $1.9 tril-
lion because that is supposedly what 
the country needs to help get us past 
this pandemic. Yet we are going to let 
people into the country, unchecked, to 
potentially spread the virus. 
President Biden’s policies at the bor-
der are reckless. The American people 
can see it for themselves, and the data 
prove how bad the situation has be-
come in such a quick timeframe. 
We can and should take positive, 
proactive, concrete steps to secure our 
border and strengthen our national se-
curity. There are two big items to ad-
dress right away. 
No. 1, we should maintain the Mi-
grant Protection Protocols Program. 
This system was put in place during 
the Trump administration to process 
migrant asylum claims at the border 
without 
releasing 
people 
into 
the 
United States. It requires that mi-
grants remain in Mexico pending the 
completion of their cases. It was suc-
cessful—hugely successful. The number 
of apprehensions along the border went 
down 
when 
people 
realized 
they 
couldn’t just come walking into the 
United States. It was exactly the kind 
of message we want to send: Our bor-
ders are not wide open. You must fol-
low the rules. You must get in line. 
Since taking office, President Biden 
has dismantled the program and is 
bringing in nearly 30,000 people who are 
waiting in Mexico. 
No. 2, we should continue to build the 
wall. My constituents expect me to 
hammer this point home every day. A 
strong wall will help prevent illegal 
migrants from crossing over our border 
between ports of entry to avoid law en-
forcement. 
Just recently, there were reports of a 
car crash in California that left 13 ille-
gal migrants dead who were stuffed and 
stacked in the back of a truck. Border 
Patrol officers believe these migrants 
entered through a ‘‘dilapidated border 
fence’’ in Southern California. Weak-
nesses in our border allow human traf-
ficking efforts like this to continue. 
This has to stop. Without needed fixes, 
President Biden offers false hope, and 
that is a dangerous signal for desperate 
people. 
Today, I am only mentioning two 
ways to address the border surge. 
There are plenty more, and I plan to 
advocate for them in the weeks and 
months to come because, unlike this 
President and his administration, I am 
fighting for the safety and security of 
the American people. 
I understand our immigration system 
is not perfect, and I understand Presi-
dent Biden has a different view on what 
our immigration system should look 
like, and he has made no secret about 
where he stands. But any immigration 
reform proposed must include policies 
that strengthen our lawful immigra-
tion system and protect our Nation’s 
borders. So far, President Biden’s poli-
cies do neither. 
I can respect different visions for the 
future even though I may strongly dis-
agree with them, but what I and the 
people of Alabama will not stand for is 
a refusal to enforce the laws of today. 
It puts our country at risk and encour-
ages migrants to seek dangerous paths 
to enter our country instead of the 
legal paths our laws provide. Allowing 
illegal immigration to go unchecked 
fundamentally undermines the rule of 
law in this country. Without laws and 
without 
borders 
where 
those 
laws 
apply, a sovereign nation ceases to 
exist. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL D. ROACH 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate and honor the 
retirement of one of my senior staff 
members and friend who has served in 
my home State of Idaho for the last 12 
years as the State director of natural 
resources, Michael ‘‘Mike’’ D. Roach. 
After retiring from the banking in-
dustry, Mike came to my staff after my 
first election to the U.S. Senate in 2009 
as the regional director of my Lewiston 
office. However, with a bachelor’s de-
gree in wildlife-fisheries resources from 
the University of Idaho, I knew he was 
a perfect fit for the State director of 
natural resources position stationed in 
my Boise office. Shortly after starting 
in Lewiston, Mike helped to find his re-
placement in north Idaho and moved to 
southwestern Idaho to lead my State 
offices in natural resources. 
Mike was born in Twin Falls and 
grew up in southwestern Idaho where 
his father worked in the cattle and 
banking industry. This afforded him 
the opportunity to work and associate 
with the cattle and sheep industry in 
Idaho 
and 
develop 
a 
deep 
under-
standing of the history, traditions, and 
issues of Idaho. While in college at the 
U of I, he worked for Idaho Fish and 
Game and served as a Wildlife and 
Range 
Sciences 
Guidance 
Council 
member for the U of I’s College of For-
estry. He was also appointed to the dis-
trict advisory council for the Bureau of 
Land Management—Boise District by 
former 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Interior 
Manuel Lujan. With his deep roots in 
Idaho, he was the perfect ambassador 
to the diverse natural resource and 
conservation groups of the State like 
the Idaho Cattle Association, Idaho 
Farm Bureau, Trout Unlimited, and 
the Nature Conservancy. 
During his 12 years of service as my 
natural resources director, he advised 
and guided my office through many 
complicated issues like the sage grouse 
recovery plan, Idaho Roadless Rule im-
plementation, salmon and steelhead 
management plans, Columbia River 
Treaty, Good Neighbor Authority, and 
many other resource issues. Due to his 
experience and knowledge, in 2015, the 
University of Idaho College of Natural 
Resources awarded Mike Roach the 
Alumni Award, recognizing his career 
achievements in natural resources. 
Another significant milestone came 
to pass while serving on staff; he be-
came engaged and married to Cally 
Grindstaff in 2019. They now make 
their home in Fairfield, ID. 
It is always difficult to lose a trusted 
staff member of Mike’s caliber, but I 
want to wish him and Cally nothing 
but best wishes in their future endeav-
ors and look forward to our continued 
friendship in the years ahead. 
Congratulations and thank you for 
your outstanding service to my staff 
and the citizens of Idaho.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO REVEREND KEVIN 
COX 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, on 
March 15, 2021, having served the Lou-
isiana 
District 
United 
Pentecostal 
Church in the role of district secretary, 
1998–2005, and district superintendent, 
2005–Present, Reverend Kevin Cox will 
retire from his current role, though re-
maining active in ministry. 
Kevin was born in St. Paul, MN— 
spent his early years in Missouri—be-
fore moving to Bogalusa in 1974, when 
his father became pastor there. He is a 
graduate of Southeastern Louisiana 
University, where he earned a BS in ac-
counting. In addition to his ministerial 
license, he holds CPA credentials. He 
married the love of his life, Delisa, in 
1979. She passed away in the spring of 
2012. Kevin and Delisa served as pastor 
in Wewahitchka, FL, from 1980–1986 be-
fore returning to Bogalusa where they 
joined Kevin’s parents and assumed the 
pastorate of First Pentecostal Church 
of Bogalusa for 12 years. With his elec-
tion as district secretary, the Cox 
Family—Kevin and Delisa, along with 
their two sons, Andrew and Stephen— 
relocated to the Campground in Tioga. 
As district superintendent, in addi-
tion to being responsible for the over-
sight of the ministers and churches of 
Louisiana, Reverend Cox has continued 
to coordinate the Louisiana United 
Pentecostal Camp Meeting. This an-
nual Camp Meeting event has convened 
for over 100 years here in Louisiana and 
consists of a week of worship, fellow-
ship, and fun. The Bible speaks of lay-
ing up crowns in heaven as a reward for 
good works on earth. I hope it is many 
years before Kevin Cox ascends to 
heaven. When he does, he will have 
many crowns.∑

By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
TILLIS, Mr. COONS, and Mr. 
LEAHY): 
S. 632. A bill to amend chapter 11 of 
title 35, United States Code, to require 
the 
voluntary 
collection 
of 
demo-
graphic information for patent inven-
tors, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Inventor Diver-
sity for Economic Advancement Act of 
2021. I thank my colleague from North 
Carolina, Senator TILLIS, for working 
with me on this important piece of leg-
islation, which serves as a first step to 
closing the diversity gap in our patent 
system by collecting demographic data 
on patent applicants. 
Women and racial minorities have 
made some of the most significant in-
ventions in this Nation’s history. The 
$75 billion home security industry grew 
from an initial home security system 
invented by Marie Van Brittan Brown. 
The computer would never have be-
come the multimedia device it is today 
without the microcomputer system in-
vented by Mark Dean. The genetic rev-
olution would still be science fiction if 
not for the CRISPR gene-editing tool 
discovered by Jennifer Doudna—raised 
on Hawaii’s Big Island. 
We should celebrate these inventors 
and the many others like them who 
have contributed to innovation in this 
Nation. But we must also recognize the 
hard truth that women, racial minori-
ties, and many other groups are great-
ly underrepresented in the U.S. patent 
system. 
The Patent and Trademark Office’s 
recent report on women inventors 
shines a spotlight on one part of this 
problem. The PTO found that only 22 
percent of U.S. patents list a woman as 
an inventor and that women make up 
only 13 percent of all inventors. This is 
true even though women held 43 per-
cent of all full-time jobs in 2016 and 28 
percent of STEM jobs in 2015. 
Other reports highlight racial patent 
gaps. For example, a report by the In-
stitute for Women’s Policy Research 
found that the percentage of African 
American and Hispanic college grad-
uates who hold patents is approxi-
mately half that of their white coun-
terparts. 
Closing these gaps would turbocharge 
our economy. According to a study by 
Michigan State University Professor 
Lisa Cook, including more women and 
African Americans in the ‘‘initial stage 
of the process of innovation’’ could in-
crease GDP by as much as $640 billion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1426 
March 9, 2021 
Another study by the National Bureau 
of 
Economic 
Research 
found 
that 
eliminating the patent gap for women 
with science and engineering degrees 
alone would increase GDP by over $500 
billion. 
It’s simply good policy and good busi-
ness to want to fully integrate people 
of all types into our innovation econ-
omy. But if we have any hope of clos-
ing the various patent gaps, we must 
first get a firm grasp on the scope of 
the problem. 
Studies of the demographic makeup 
of patentees, like the ones I described, 
are few and far between. The reason is 
a simple one. A lack of data. The PTO 
does not collect any data on applicants 
beyond their first and last names and 
city, State, and country of residence. 
As a result, those wishing to study pat-
ent 
gaps 
between 
different 
demo-
graphic groups are forced to guess the 
gender of an applicant based on his or 
her name, determine the race of an ap-
plicant 
by 
cross-referencing 
census 
data, or explore a number of other op-
tions that are time-consuming, unreli-
able, or both. 
The IDEA Act solves this problem. It 
would require the PTO to collect demo-
graphic data—including gender, race, 
and military or veteran status—from 
patent applicants on a voluntary basis. 
It would further require the PTO to 
issue reports on the data collected and, 
perhaps more importantly, make the 
data available to the public with appro-
priate protections for personally iden-
tifiable information. Outside research-
ers could therefore conduct their own 
analyses and offer insights into the 
various patent gaps in our society. 
Let me be clear. Closing the informa-
tion gap facing researchers alone will 
not solve the patent gap facing women, 
racial minorities, and so many others. 
But it is a critical first step. I there-
fore encourage my colleagues to sup-
port the IDEA Act. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and 
Mr. LANKFORD): 
S. 644. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to restore 
State authority to waive for certain fa-
cilities the 35-mile rule for designating 
critical access hospitals under the 
Medicare program, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows:

Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. CARDIN, 
Mr. RUBIO, Mr. COONS, Mr. KAINE, Mr. 
YOUNG, and Mr. VAN
HOLLEN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 97 
Whereas the United States and the Federal 
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia share an 
important relationship and more than a cen-
tury of diplomatic relations; 
Whereas Ethiopia is the second most popu-
lous country in Africa and plays a key role 
in advancing security and stability across 
sub-Saharan Africa, including as a top con-
tributor of uniformed personnel to United 
Nations peacekeeping missions; 
Whereas tensions between Prime Minister 
Abiy Ahmed’s Prosperity Party and the 
Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), 
which was part of the ruling coalition in 
Ethiopia until late 2019, escalated when the 
TPLF held elections in the Tigray Region of 
Ethiopia on September 9, 2020, despite the 
decision by the Federal Government of Ethi-
opia to postpone general elections due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the TPLF rejected the postpone-
ment of general elections and considered the 
extension of the term of the Federal Govern-
ment to be unconstitutional, and the Federal 
Government subsequently deemed the Tigray 
regional elections illegitimate; 
Whereas, in the early hours of November 4, 
2020, Prime Minister Abiy ordered a military 
offensive in response to an attack by the 
TPLF on the Northern Command of the 
Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF), 
which evolved into an armed conflict be-
tween the ENDF and allied forces on one side 
and the TPLF on the other side, with thou-
sands of deaths reported; 
Whereas the Government of Ethiopia re-
jected all offers, including one extended by 
African Union Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa in 
November 2020, to mediate talks with the 
TPLF; 
Whereas, on November 28, 2020, the Govern-
ment of Ethiopia claimed victory in the con-
flict after taking Mekelle, the capital city of 
the Tigray Region, with Prime Minister Abiy 
announcing that his forces had ‘‘completed 
and ceased the military operations’’ and 
would shift focus to rebuilding the region 
and providing humanitarian assistance while 
Federal police attempt to apprehend leaders 
of the TPLF; 
Whereas clashes have continued in the 
Tigray Region and Ethiopian soldiers and al-
lied forces have pursued prominent TPLF 
leaders, notably killing former Minister of 
Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia Seyoum Mesfin 
as part of a ‘‘stabilizing mission . . . to bring 
to justice perpetrators’’; 
Whereas, in 2020, prior to the outbreak of 
fighting in the Tigray Region, there were 
more than 1,800,000 people internally dis-
placed 
in 
Ethiopia 
and 
approximately 
2,000,000 people in the Tigray Region were al-
ready in need of humanitarian assistance; 
Whereas the conflict in the Tigray Region 
has prompted more than 61,000 Ethiopians to 
seek refuge in Sudan, has displaced as many 
as 500,000 people internally, and has caused 
severe shortages of food, water, medical sup-
plies, and other necessary goods for those 
who remain in the region; 
Whereas the conflict has disrupted har-
vests, 
livelihoods, 
markets, 
and 
supply 
chains, food and medical supplies have been 
looted, and restrictions and bureaucratic im-
pediments continue to constrain the humani-
tarian response, with nearly 4,000,000 people 
in the Tigray Region estimated to require 
urgent food assistance, including 100,000 Eri-
trean refugees; 
Whereas, during the first few weeks of the 
conflict, there was a complete shutdown of 
electricity, banking, internet, and telephone 
services throughout the Tigray Region by 
the Government of Ethiopia, with govern-
ment reports of TPLF forces also destroying 
communications infrastructure, and subse-
quent service restorations have been limited; 
Whereas, in addition to the shutdown of 
telephone and internet services, which has 
severely limited the flow of information on 
the conflict and the humanitarian situation, 
journalists have been restricted from access-
ing much of the Tigray Region, several jour-
nalists have been arrested in connection to 
their coverage of the conflict, and one jour-
nalist working for the Tigray Mass Media 
Agency was killed; 
Whereas, although the Government of 
Ethiopia entered into an agreement with the 
United Nations on November 29, 2020, to fa-
cilitate humanitarian access to the Tigray 
Region, that access remains limited; 
Whereas, on February 1, 2021, the Secretary 
General of the Norwegian Refugee Council 
stated, ‘‘Twelve weeks since the fighting 
began, the basic elements of a response on 
the scale needed are still not in place. It is 
false to say that aid is increasingly getting 
through. Aid has only gone to the places 
with little conflict and more limited needs 
and is not keeping pace with the humani-
tarian crisis as it inevitably grows over 
time.’’; 
Whereas, on February 6, 2021, the United 
Nations World Food Programme (WFP) an-
nounced a new agreement with the Govern-
ment of Ethiopia to rapidly scale up the de-
ployment of emergency food assistance while 
improving the process for reviewing and ap-
proving requests from United Nations and 
humanitarian partner agencies; 
Whereas humanitarian access to the ref-
ugee camps that were home to almost 100,000 
Eritrean refugees at the start of the conflict 
has been especially restricted, with the 
Hitsats and Shimelba camps still completely 
inaccessible, and the United Nations Refugee 
Agency estimates that 20,000 Eritrean refu-
gees displaced from those camps remain un-
accounted for; 
Whereas United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi has ex-
pressed alarm about the ‘‘overwhelming 
number of disturbing reports of Eritrean ref-
ugees in Tigray being killed, abducted and 
forcibly returned to Eritrea’’; 
Whereas, in November 2020, four humani-
tarian workers, including one employee of 
the International Rescue Committee and 
three employees of the Danish Refugee Coun-
cil, were killed at Hitsats refugee camp; 
Whereas challenges to access have signifi-
cantly restricted the reporting and docu-
mentation of atrocities, but survivor and 
eye-witness testimony and satellite imagery 
have enabled reports to emerge of targeted 
violence or indiscriminate attacks against 
civilians committed by multiple parties to 
the conflict; 
Whereas examples of reported atrocities 
committed in the Tigray Region include the 
massacre in the town of Mai Kadra on No-
vember 9, 2020, in which, according to esti-
mates from the Ethiopian Human Rights 
Commission (EHRC), more than 600 civilians 
died from what the EHRC Chief Commis-
sioner concluded was ‘‘for no reason other 
than their ethnicity,’’ and a mass killing in 
the city of Axum on November 28 through 29, 
2020, which involved, according to reports 
from Amnesty International, the systematic 
killing of ‘‘hundreds of unarmed civilians’’ 
after Ethiopian and Eritrean troops retook 
the city; 
Whereas United Nations Special Represent-
ative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Vi-
olence in Conflict Pramila Patten has high-
lighted reports of sexual and gender-based vi-
olence, including a high number of alleged 
rapes in Mekelle; 
Whereas, on January 27, 2021, the United 
States Government publicly confirmed that 
Eritrean Defense Forces (EDF) are partici-
pating in the conflict in alliance with the 
ENDF and called for the immediate with-
drawal of all EDF soldiers from the Tigray 
Region, and credible reports have emerged 
that EDF soldiers participating in the con-
flict have attacked civilians, including Eri-
trean refugees, and looted and destroyed 
homes and religious institutions; 
Whereas Ethiopia has been beset in recent 
years by multiple human rights and humani-
tarian challenges, including targeted ethnic 
violence, intercommunal conflict, natural 
disasters, and political unrest; 
Whereas, since mid-2020, the Office of the 
United 
Nations 
High 
Commissioner 
for 
Human Rights, Amnesty International, and 
the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission 
have reported atrocities and a rise in ethnic 
and intercommunal violence in other parts 
of 
Ethiopia, 
including 
in 
the 
Amhara, 
Benishangul-Gumuz, 
Somali, 
Afar, 
and 
Oromia regions; 
Whereas, 
according 
to 
international 
human rights organizations, during the con-
flict in the Tigray Region, ethnic Tigrayans 
throughout Ethiopia have been suspended 
from their jobs and prevented from leaving 
the country, and there are reports of surveil-
lance and mass arrests of citizens of Ethiopia 
based on their ethnicity; 
Whereas Ethiopia is undergoing a fragile 
democratic transition, with the postponed 
2020 general elections rescheduled for June 
2021, except in the Tigray Region, where 
elections have not yet been scheduled; 
Whereas the Government of Ethiopia has 
restricted the right of several opposition po-
litical parties to peacefully assemble, and a 
number of opposition leaders have been 
jailed since the summer of 2020, with varying 
degrees of due process violations and proce-
dural delays in their trials; and 
Whereas the conflict in the Tigray Region 
occurs within the context of complicated re-
gional and global dynamics featuring ongo-
ing negotiations between Ethiopia, Egypt, 
and Sudan over the Grand Ethiopian Renais-
sance Dam, Ethiopia’s rapprochement with 
Eritrea, threats posed by the violent extrem-
ist organization Al-Shabaab, a struggle for 
influence and power among regional and 
global actors, increasingly hostile border 
disputes between Ethiopia and Sudan, and 
the fragile democratic transition and peace 
process in Sudan: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) strongly disapproves of the escalation 
of political tensions between the Govern-
ment of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s 
Liberation Front (TPLF) into armed conflict 
and condemns in the strongest terms all vio-
lence against civilians;

ALUMNI AND AMERICORPS SEN-
IORS 
VOLUNTEERS 
TO 
THE 
LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF THE 
UNITED STATES 
Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. CAS-
SIDY) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 98 
Whereas, since their inceptions, each of the 
AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors na-
tional service programs have proven to be a 
highly effective way— 
(1) to engage the people of the United 
States in meeting a wide range of local and 
national needs; and 
(2) to promote the ethics of service and vol-
unteerism; 
Whereas, each year, nearly 270,000 individ-
uals serve in AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps 
Seniors at 40,000 locations across the United 
States to give back in an intensive way to 
communities, States, Tribal nations, and the 
United States; 
Whereas AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Sen-
iors funds have been invested in nonprofit, 
community, educational, and faith-based 
groups, and those funds leverage hundreds of 
millions of dollars in outside funding and in- 
kind donations each year; 
Whereas 
AmeriCorps 
members 
and 
AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers have pro-
vided millions of hours of service nation-
wide, helping— 
(1) to improve the lives of the most vulner-
able people of the United States; 
(2) to protect the environment; 
(3) to contribute to public safety; 
(4) to respond to disasters; 
(5) to strengthen the educational system of 
the United States; and 
(6) to expand economic opportunity; 
Whereas 
AmeriCorps 
members 
and 
AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers recruit and 
supervise millions of community volunteers, 
demonstrating the value of AmeriCorps as a 
powerful force for encouraging people to be-
come involved in volunteering and commu-
nity service; 
Whereas, 
for 
more 
than 
5 
decades, 
AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers in the RSVP, 
Foster Grandparent, and Senior Companion 
programs have played an important role in 
strengthening communities by sharing their 
experience, knowledge, and accomplishments 
with the individuals they serve; 
Whereas, since 1994, more than 1,200,000 in-
dividuals have taken the AmeriCorps pledge 
to ‘‘get things done for America’’ by becom-
ing 
AmeriCorps 
members 
through 
the 
AmeriCorps State and National, AmeriCorps 
VISTA, and AmeriCorps NCCC programs; 
Whereas AmeriCorps members nationwide, 
in return for the service of those members, 
have earned more than $4,000,000,000 to use to 
further their own educational advancement 
at colleges and universities across the 
United States; 
Whereas AmeriCorps is a proven pathway 
to employment, providing members with val-
uable career skills, experience, and contacts 
to prepare them for the 21st century work-
force and to help close the skills gap in the 
United States; 
Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed the bi-
partisan Serve America Act (Public Law 111– 
13; 123 Stat. 1460), which authorized the ex-
pansion of national service, expanded oppor-
tunities to serve, increased efficiency and ac-
countability, and strengthened the capacity 
of organizations and communities to solve 
problems; 
Whereas national service programs have 
engaged millions of people in the United 
States in results-driven service in the most 
vulnerable 
communities 
of 
the 
United 
States, providing hope and help to individ-
uals with economic and social needs; 
Whereas national service and volunteerism 
demonstrate the best of the spirit of the 
United States, with people turning toward 
problems and working together to find com-
munity solutions; and 
Whereas AmeriCorps Week, observed in 
2021 from March 7 through March 13, is an 
appropriate time for the people of the United 
States— 
(1) 
to 
salute 
current 
and 
former 
AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Sen-
iors volunteers for their positive impact on 
the lives of people in the United States; 
(2) to thank the community partners of 
AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors for 
making the programs possible; and 
(3) to encourage more people in the United 
States to become involved in service and vol-
unteering: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) encourages the people of the United 
States to join in a national effort— 
(A) to salute AmeriCorps members and 
alumni and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers; 
and 
(B) to raise awareness about the impor-
tance of national and community service; 
(2) acknowledges the significant accom-
plishments of the members, alumni, and 
community partners of AmeriCorps and 
AmeriCorps Seniors; 
(3) recognizes the important contributions 
made by AmeriCorps members and alumni 
and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers to the 
lives of the people of the United States; and 
(4) encourages individuals of all ages to 
consider 
opportunities 
to 
serve 
in 
AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors.

SENATE RESOLUTION 99—OBSERV-
ING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE UPRISING IN SYRIA 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RISCH, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. RUBIO, Mrs. 
SHAHEEN, Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. KAINE, Mr. 
ROMNEY, Mr. MURPHY, Mr. HAGERTY, 
and Mr. COONS) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 99 
Whereas 10 years ago, on March 15th, 2011, 
in the midst of the Arab Spring, hundreds of 
Syrians peacefully assembled to call on their 
leadership for democratic reforms and re-
spect for their fundamental freedoms, spark-
ing a nationwide movement; 
Whereas in response to the predominantly 
peaceful protests, Syrian President Bashar 
al-Assad ordered unyielding violence against 
the people of Syria, including arbitrary de-
tentions, torture, killing, and attacks on ci-
vilians and civilian infrastructure, often 
under the false premise of combating ter-
rorism; 
Whereas over the course of this conflict, 
the Assad regime has exhibited unrelenting 
depravity in its use of chemical weapons and 
barrel bombs, deliberately targeting civilian 
infrastructure, 
including 
hospitals 
and 
schools, and committing gross violations of 
international humanitarian law;

March 9, 2021 
Whereas the former Syrian military pho-
tographer 
‘‘Caesar’’ 
meticulously 
photo-
graphed the Assad regime’s widespread sys-
tem of arrest, detention, torture and murder 
of tens of thousands of Syrian protesters and 
dissidents, and then courageously smuggled 
55,000 of those photographs out of Syria, ex-
posing the regime’s barbarity for the world 
to witness; 
Whereas the Caesar Syria Civilian Protec-
tion Act of 2019 (22 U.S.C. 8791 note), which 
became law on December 20, 2019— 
(1) seeks accountability for the Assad 
regime and its international enablers for 
atrocities against the Syrian people; 
(2) denies the Assad regime the re-
sources to fuel its war machine; and 
(3) sends a clear signal to the inter-
national community against normalizing, re-
habilitating, or legitimizing Assad and his 
backers. 
Whereas Iran and Russia intervened mili-
tarily in support of the Assad regime, ena-
bling and actively participating in the Assad 
regime’s horrific brutalities against civilians 
in favor of advancing their narrow interests 
and in some cases empowered extremist 
groups; 
Whereas in pursuit of its narrow self-inter-
est, Russia, backed by China, has blunted 
United Nations’ efforts to preserve vital bor-
der crossings that serve as a critical humani-
tarian lifeline to the beleaguered Syrian pop-
ulation. 
Whereas the Islamic State in Iraq and 
Syria exacerbated the suffering of the Syrian 
people through the violent and hostile sei-
zure of territory, misapplication of Islamic 
law, destruction and smuggling of antiq-
uities, and oil smuggling, turning Syria into 
a global hub for terrorist activity; 
Whereas the Assad regime, and its Russian 
and Iranian backers, are largely responsible 
for the death of more than 500,000 Syrian ci-
vilians, and the displacement of more than 
12,000,000 men, women, and children within 
and outside of Syria’s borders, imposing irre-
versible trauma and loss for a whole genera-
tion; 
Whereas millions of Syrians are struggling 
to survive, with more than 13,000,000 Syrians 
who are in need of humanitarian assistance 
and more than 9,000,000 Syrians who are fac-
ing food insecurity; 
Whereas international efforts to secure a 
peaceful political transition of power in 
Syria, in accordance with United Nations Se-
curity Council Resolution 2254, adopted on 
December 18, 2015, remain stymied, due al-
most entirely to the intransigence of Russia 
and the Assad regime, holding the people of 
Syria hostage; 
Whereas the people and Government of the 
United States support the people of Syria in 
their aspirations for peace, stability, dig-
nity, and accountability: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) solemnly observes the 10th anniver-
sary of the Syrian uprising; 
(2) affirms that it is the policy of the 
United States— 
(A) to seek a political solution to the 
Syrian conflict; 
(B) to continue to stand with the people 
of Syria; 
(C) to further efforts to secure a perma-
nent ceasefire; 
(D) to continue work on the constitu-
tional committee free from regime intran-
sigence; and 
(E) to foster conditions for free and fair 
elections in accordance with United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 2254; 
(3) affirms that it is the policy of the 
United States to promote adherence to the 
laws of war by all parties engaging in hos-
tilities in Syria; 
(4) affirms that it is the policy of the 
United States to support international hu-
manitarian efforts to assist innocent civil-
ians, including through support for displaced 
populations and the promotion of account-
ability for perpetrators of human rights 
abuses; 
(5) commits to continuing efforts to hold 
the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian 
backers accountable for war crimes and 
crimes against humanity; including through 
implementation of the Caesar Syria Civilian 
Protection Act of 2019; 
(6) commends the bravery of Syrian 
human rights defenders who, in the service 
of justice and accountability, have coura-
geously documented the atrocities com-
mitted by the Assad regime and its Russian 
and Iranian backers over the course of this 
conflict; 
(7) condemns the indiscriminate use of 
force by all actors in Syria, including the 
Assad regime, its proponents, its opponents, 
and extremist groups; 
(8) calls on the United States Govern-
ment to reinvigorate diplomatic efforts to 
resolve the conflict as outlined under United 
Nations Security Council Resolution 2254, 
and to expand humanitarian aid to the Syr-
ian people so they may— 
(A) be free from violence, whether from 
the state or other armed groups; 
(B) return to their communities of their 
own free will and in an informed manner; 
(C) participate in transitional justice; 
and 
(D) decide their own futures through free 
and fair elections that result in a legitimate 
representative government that serves all 
Syrians.

RESOLUTION 
100—SUP-
PORTING THE GOALS OF INTER-
NATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 
Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. COL-
LINS, Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. MERKLEY, and 
Mr. MURPHY) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 100 
Whereas, as of March 2021, there are ap-
proximately 3,803,000,000 women and girls in 
the world; 
Whereas women and girls around the 
world— 
(1) have fundamental human rights; 
(2) play a critical role in providing and car-
ing for their families and driving positive 
change in their communities; 
(3) contribute substantially to food secu-
rity, economic growth, the prevention and 
resolution of conflict, and the sustainability 
of peace and stability; and 
(4) must have meaningful opportunities to 
more fully participate in and lead the polit-
ical, social, and economic lives of their com-
munities; 
Whereas the advancement and empower-
ment of women and girls around the world is 
a foreign policy priority for the United 
States and is critical to the achievement of 
global peace and prosperity; 
Whereas the National Security Strategy of 
the United States, published in December 
2017— 
(1) declares that ‘‘[s]ocieties that empower 
women to participate fully in civic and eco-
nomic life are more prosperous and peace-
ful’’; 
(2) supports ‘‘efforts to advance women’s 
equality, protect the rights of women and 
girls, and promote women and youth em-
powerment programs’’; and 
(3) recognizes that ‘‘governments that fail 
to treat women equally do not allow their 
societies to reach their potential’’; 
Whereas, on October 6, 2017, the Women, 
Peace, and Security Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 
2152j et seq.) was enacted into law, which in-
cludes requirements for a government-wide 
‘‘Women, Peace, and Security Strategy’’ to 
promote and strengthen the participation of 
women in peace negotiations and conflict 
prevention overseas, enhanced training for 
relevant United States Government per-
sonnel, and follow-up evaluations of the ef-
fectiveness of the strategy; 
Whereas the United States Strategy on 
Women, Peace, and Security, dated June 
2019, recognizes that— 
(1) 
the 
‘‘[s]ocial 
and 
political 
marginalization of women strongly cor-
relates with the likelihood that a country 
will experience conflict’’; 
(2) there is a ‘‘tremendous amount of un-
tapped potential among the world’s women 
and girls to identify, recommend, and imple-
ment effective solutions to conflict’’, and 
there are ‘‘benefits derived from creating op-
portunities for women and girls to serve as 
agents of peace via political, economic, and 
social empowerment’’; and 
(3) barriers to the meaningful participation 
of women and girls in conflict prevention 
and resolution efforts ‘‘include under-rep-
resentation in political leadership, pervasive 
violence against women and girls, and per-
sistent inequality in many societies’’; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Entity for Gender Equality and the Em-
powerment of Women (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘UN Women’’), peace negotiations are 
more likely to end in a peace agreement 
when women and women’s groups play a 
meaningful role in the negotiation process; 
Whereas, according to a study by the Inter-
national Peace Institute, a peace agreement 
is 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 
years if women participate in the develop-
ment of the peace agreement; 
Whereas the joint strategy of the Depart-
ment of State and the United States Agency 
for International Development (USAID) enti-
tled ‘‘Department of State & USAID Joint 
Strategy on Countering Violent Extremism’’ 
and dated May 2016— 
(1) notes that women can play a critical 
role in identifying and addressing drivers of 
violent extremism in their families, commu-
nities, and broader society; and 
(2) commits to supporting programs that 
engage women ‘‘as key stakeholders in pre-
venting and countering violent extremism in 
their communities’’; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of Inter-
national Narcotics and Law Enforcement Af-
fairs of the Department of State, the full and 
meaningful participation of women in crimi-
nal justice professions and security forces 
vastly enhances the effectiveness of the secu-
rity forces; 
Whereas, 
despite 
the 
contributions 
of 
women to society, hundreds of millions of 
women and girls around the world continue 
to be denied the right to participate freely in 
civic and economic life, lack fundamental 
legal protections, and remain vulnerable to 
exploitation and abuse; 
Whereas, 
every 
year, 
approximately 
12,000,000 girls are married before they reach 
the age of 18, which means that— 
(1) nearly 33,000 girls are married every 
day; or 
(2) nearly 23 girls are married every 
minute; 
Whereas, despite global progress, it is pre-
dicted that by 2030 more than 150,000,000 
more girls will marry before reaching the 
age of 18, and approximately 2,400,000 girls 
who are married before reaching the age of 18 
are under the age of 15; 
Whereas girls living in countries affected 
by conflict or other humanitarian crises are 
often the most vulnerable to child marriage,

and 9 of the 10 countries with the highest 
rates of child marriage are considered fragile 
or extremely fragile; 
Whereas, according to the International 
Labour Organization, 71 percent of the esti-
mated 40,300,000 victims of modern slavery in 
2016 were women or girls; 
Whereas, according to the United Nation’s 
Children’s Fund (commonly referred to as 
‘‘UNICEF’’)— 
(1) approximately 1⁄4 of girls between the 
ages of 15 and 19 have been victims of some 
form of physical violence; 
(2) approximately 120,000,000 girls world-
wide, slightly more than 1 in 10, have experi-
enced forced sexual acts; and 
(3) an estimated 1 in 3 women around the 
world has experienced some form of physical 
or sexual violence; 
Whereas, according to the 2018 report of 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime entitled ‘‘Global Report on Traf-
ficking in Persons’’, from 2003 to 2018, 72 per-
cent of all detected trafficking victims were 
women or girls; 
Whereas, on August 10, 2012, the United 
States Government launched a strategy enti-
tled ‘‘United States Strategy to Prevent and 
Respond to Gender-Based Violence Glob-
ally’’, which is the first interagency strategy 
that— 
(1) addresses gender-based violence around 
the world; 
(2) advances the rights and status of 
women and girls; 
(3) promotes gender equality in United 
States foreign policy; and 
(4) works to bring about a world in which 
all individuals can pursue their aspirations 
without the threat of violence; 
Whereas, in June 2016, the Department of 
State released an update to that strategy, 
underscoring that ‘‘[p]reventing and respond-
ing to gender-based violence is a cornerstone 
of the U.S. Government’s commitment to ad-
vancing human rights and promoting gender 
equality and the empowerment of women 
and girls’’; 
Whereas, despite the achievements of indi-
vidual female leaders and evidence that de-
mocracy and equality under the law form a 
mutually reinforcing relationship in which 
higher levels of equality are strongly cor-
related with the relative state of peace of a 
country, a healthier domestic security envi-
ronment, and lower levels of aggression to-
ward other countries— 
(1) women around the world remain vastly 
underrepresented in— 
(A) national and local legislatures and 
governments; and 
(B) other high-level positions; and 
(2) according to the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union, women account for only 25 percent of 
national parliamentarians and 21 percent of 
government ministers; 
Whereas the ability of women and girls to 
realize their full potential is critical to the 
ability of a country to achieve strong and 
lasting economic growth, self-reliance, and 
political and social stability; 
Whereas the overall level of violence 
against women is a better predictor of the 
peacefulness of a country, the compliance of 
a country with international treaty obliga-
tions, and the relations of a country with 
neighboring countries than indicators meas-
uring the level of democracy, level of wealth, 
or level of institutionalization of the coun-
try; 
Whereas, although the United Nations Mil-
lennium Project reached the goal of achiev-
ing gender parity in primary education in 
most countries in 2015, more work remains 
to be done to achieve gender equality in pri-
mary and secondary education, and particu-
larly in secondary education worldwide as 
gender gaps persist and widen, by address-
ing— 
(1) discriminatory practices; 
(2) harmful cultural and social norms; 
(3) inadequate sanitation facilities, includ-
ing facilities to manage menstruation; 
(4) child, early, and forced marriage; 
(5) poverty; 
(6) early pregnancy and motherhood; 
(7) conflict and insecurity; and 
(8) other factors that favor boys or devalue 
girls’ education; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organi-
zation— 
(1) approximately 132,000,000 girls between 
the ages of 6 and 17 remain out of school; 
(2) girls living in countries affected by con-
flict are 2.5 times more likely to be out of 
primary school than boys; 
(3) girls are twice as likely as boys to never 
set foot in a classroom; and 
(4) up to 30 percent of girls who drop out of 
school do so because of adolescent pregnancy 
or child marriage; 
Whereas women around the world face a 
variety of constraints that severely limit 
their economic participation and produc-
tivity and remain underrepresented in the 
labor force; 
Whereas the economic empowerment of 
women is inextricably linked to a myriad of 
other human rights that are essential to the 
ability of women to thrive as economic ac-
tors, including— 
(1) living lives free of violence and exploi-
tation; 
(2) achieving the highest possible standard 
of health and well-being; 
(3) enjoying full legal and human rights, 
such as access to registration, identification, 
and citizenship documents, and freedom of 
movement; 
(4) access to formal and informal edu-
cation; 
(5) access to, and equal protection under, 
land and property rights; 
(6) access to fundamental labor rights; 
(7) the implementation of policies to ad-
dress disproportionate care burdens; and 
(8) receiving business and management 
skills and leadership opportunities; 
Whereas closing the global gender gap in 
labor markets could increase worldwide 
gross domestic product by as much as 
$28,000,000,000,000 by 2025; 
Whereas, pursuant to section 3(b) of the 
Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic 
Empowerment Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 2151– 
2(b)), it is the international development co-
operation policy of the United States— 
(1) to reduce gender disparities with re-
spect to economic, social, political, edu-
cational, and cultural resources, as well as 
wealth, opportunities, and services; 
(2) to strive to eliminate gender-based vio-
lence and mitigate its harmful effects on in-
dividuals 
and 
communities, 
including 
through efforts to develop standards and ca-
pacity to reduce gender-based violence in the 
workplace and other places where women 
work; 
(3) to support activities that secure private 
property rights and land tenure for women in 
developing countries, including— 
(A) supporting legal frameworks that 
give women equal rights to own, register, 
use, profit from, and inherit land and prop-
erty; 
(B) improving legal literacy to enable 
women to exercise the rights described in 
subparagraph (A); and 
(C) improving the capacity of law en-
forcement and community leaders to en-
force such rights; 
(4) to increase the capability of women and 
girls to fully exercise their rights, determine 
their life outcomes, assume leadership roles, 
and influence decision making in households, 
communities, and societies; and 
(5) to improve the access of women and 
girls to education, particularly higher edu-
cation opportunities in business, finance, 
and management, in order to enhance finan-
cial literacy and business development, man-
agement, and strategy skills; 
Whereas, according to the World Health 
Organization, global maternal mortality de-
creased by approximately 44 percent between 
1990 and 2015, yet approximately 830 women 
and girls continue to die from preventable 
causes relating to pregnancy or childbirth 
each day, and 99 percent of all maternal 
deaths occur in developing countries; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations, 
of the 830 women and adolescent girls who 
die every day from preventable causes relat-
ing to pregnancy and childbirth, 507 die each 
day in countries that are considered fragile 
because of conflict or disaster, accounting 
for approximately 3⁄5 of all maternal deaths 
worldwide; 
Whereas the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees reports that 
women and girls comprise approximately 1⁄2 
of the 67,200,000 refugees and internally dis-
placed or stateless individuals in the world; 
Whereas women and girls in humanitarian 
emergencies, including those subject to 
forced displacement, face increased and exac-
erbated vulnerabilities to— 
(1) gender-based violence, including rape, 
child marriage, domestic violence, human 
trafficking, and sexual exploitation and as-
sault; 
(2) disruptions in education and livelihood; 
(3) lack of access to health services; and 
(4) food insecurity and malnutrition; 
Whereas malnutrition poses a variety of 
threats to women and girls specifically, as 
malnutrition can weaken their immune sys-
tems, making them more susceptible to in-
fections, and affects their capacity to sur-
vive childbirth, and children born of mal-
nourished women and girls are more likely 
to have cognitive impairments and higher 
risk of disease throughout their lives; 
Whereas it is imperative— 
(1) to alleviate violence and discrimination 
against women and girls; and 
(2) to afford women and girls every oppor-
tunity to be full and productive members of 
their communities; and 
Whereas March 8, 2021, is recognized as 
International Women’s Day, a global day— 
(1) to celebrate the economic, political, 
and social achievements of women in the 
past, present, and future; and 
(2) to recognize the obstacles that women 
face in the struggle for equal rights and op-
portunities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of International 
Women’s Day; 
(2) recognizes that the fundamental human 
rights of women and girls have intrinsic 
value that affect the quality of life of women 
and girls; 
(3) recognizes that the empowerment of 
women and girls is inextricably linked to the 
potential of a country to generate— 
(A) economic growth and self-reliance; 
(B) sustainable peace and democracy; and 
(C) inclusive security; 
(4) recognizes and honors individuals in the 
United States and around the world, includ-
ing women human rights defenders, activ-
ists, and civil society leaders, who have 
worked throughout history to ensure that 
women and girls are guaranteed equality and 
fundamental human rights; 
(5) recognizes the unique cultural, histor-
ical, and religious differences throughout the 
world and urges the United States Govern-
ment to act with respect and understanding 
toward legitimate differences when pro-
moting any policies; 
(6) reaffirms the commitment—

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
101—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT, 
WHILE 
THE 
UNITED STATES FINDS VALUE 
AND 
USEFULNESS 
IN 
THE 
WORLD 
TRADE 
ORGANIZATION 
IN FULFILLING THE NEEDS OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
AND 
OTHER FREE AND OPEN ECONO-
MIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY, SIG-
NIFICANT 
REFORMS 
AT 
THE 
WORLD 
TRADE 
ORGANIZATION 
ARE NEEDED AND THE UNITED 
STATES MUST THEREFORE CON-
TINUE TO DEMONSTRATE LEAD-
ERSHIP TO ACHIEVE THOSE RE-
FORMS 
Mr. PORTMAN (for himself and Mr. 
CARDIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance: 
S. RES. 101 
Whereas the United States had led the for-
mation, as well as reform, of rules governing 
the multilateral trading system since World 
War II; 
Whereas the United States is a founding 
member of the World Trade Organization (in 
this preamble referred to as the ‘‘WTO’’) and 
a key architect of the organization; 
Whereas the United States secured impor-
tant commitments in the WTO to facilitate 
trade in goods and services, to prevent the 
application of non-scientific restrictions on 
United States agriculture, and to protect 
United States intellectual property; 
Whereas the United States uses the rules 
of the WTO to benefit workers, farmers, and 
businesses in the United States by facili-
tating access to the 90 percent of the world’s 
consumers who live outside the borders of 
the United States; 
Whereas the fundamental purpose of the 
WTO is to create space for members to nego-
tiate with each other, and the WTO reserves 
to those members exclusively the right to 
negotiate and adopt rules that reduce and 
eliminate trade barriers and discriminatory 
treatment; 
Whereas the prompt settlement of disputes 
in which a member of the WTO considers 
that its rights are being impaired by the ac-
tions of another member is essential to the 
functioning of the WTO and the maintenance 
of a proper balance between the rights and 
obligations of members; 
Whereas the WTO’s dispute settlement 
function, including in particular the Appel-
late Body, has increasingly failed to enforce 
the rules of the WTO in a timely manner, 
and has usurped the negotiating prerogative 
of members by creating new obligations and 
rights that are inconsistent with the rules 
negotiated by members; 
Whereas the creation of those obligations 
and rights undermines— 
(1) the WTO’s negotiating function by dis-
couraging members from making conces-
sions; and 
(2) the WTO’s dispute settlement function 
by encouraging overuse of the process and 
undermining its legitimacy, including by 
preventing free market economies from re-
sponding to globally trade distortive prac-
tices by nonmarket economies; 
Whereas the WTO does not have sufficient 
rules to discipline the distortive economic 
policies of nonmarket economies, such as 
policies relating to excess capacity and 
forced technology transfer, the special treat-
ment those economies afford to state-owned 
enterprises, and their massive and opaque in-
dustrial subsidies; 
Whereas there is long-standing bipartisan 
support in the United States Congress to re-
form the WTO to address those failings; 
Whereas the current presidential adminis-
tration, as well as prior administrations, 
raised concerns about the failings described 
in this preamble and have made reform of 
the WTO a top priority of United States 
trade policy; 
Whereas the United States urges WTO 
members to work constructively with the 
United States to assess the reasons why the 
existing WTO rules have proven inadequate 
in order to create an atmosphere within the 
WTO that is conducive to the development of 
new rules less subject to jurisprudential 
drift; 
Whereas the guiding principle for reform of 
the WTO, and the lens through which WTO 
members should consider specific reform pro-
posals, is the restoration of the WTO’s capa-
bility and capacity for negotiation between 
members; and 
Whereas, given that the United States has 
achieved its trade policy objectives through 
active leadership at the WTO, and that an 
absence of that leadership would be filled by 
nonmarket economies that are hostile to a 
host of United States interests: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) while the United States finds value and 
usefulness in the World Trade Organization 
(in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘WTO’’) 
in order to fulfill the needs of the United 
States and other free and open economies in 
the 21st century, significant reforms are 
needed; 
(2) the United States must therefore con-
tinue to demonstrate leadership to achieve 
reforms that restore the effectiveness of the 
WTO’s— 
(A) negotiating function; 
(B) dispute settlement function so that it 
transparently, efficiently, and fully enforces 
outcomes negotiated by members rather 
than usurping their primacy by creating new 
rights or obligations; and 
(C) rules for special and differential treat-
ment to ensure those rules promote develop-
ment for truly disadvantaged countries, 
rather than becoming tools for globally com-
petitive countries to engage in protec-
tionism and market distortions; 
(3) the efforts to reform the negotiating 
function of the WTO should revitalize the ne-
gotiating function by providing confidence 
to members that the WTO operates accord-
ing to the rules as negotiated and adopted by 
members; 
(4) a revitalized negotiating function must 
include new rules that reflect the 21st cen-
tury economy, further combat anticompeti-
tive and protectionist barriers, and ensure 
disputes are efficiently resolved; 
(5) the United States Trade Representative 
should continue to lead efforts to work with 
WTO members to pursue reforms at the WTO 
that— 
(A) ensure the dispute settlement mecha-
nism faithfully applies the rules adopted by 
members, including by undertaking meas-
ures to ensure the WTO’s Appellate Body 
does not create new rights and obligations; 
(B) improve public confidence in dispute 
settlement by promoting greater trans-
parency and efficiency in the conduct of pro-
ceedings; 
(C) redress the consistent failure by cer-
tain members to satisfy their notification 
obligations under various WTO agreements, 
including through measures that strengthen 
accountability; 
(D) ensures rules for special and differen-
tial treatment are appropriately reserved for 
countries whose state of development and 
global competitiveness actually warrants 
such flexibility; 
(E) create new rules and structures that 
can serve the interests of the United States 
while promoting peace, prosperity, good gov-
ernance, transparency, effective operation of 
legal regimes, the rule of law, and free enter-
prise; and 
(F) expand upon the trilateral negotiations 
currently underway with Japan and the Eu-
ropean Union; and 
(6) the United States Trade Representative 
should explore and assess specific reform 
proposals, including— 
(A) pursuing plurilateral agreements that 
further the interests of the United States 
while limiting the benefits accruing to coun-
tries that are not parties to those agree-
ments; 
(B) efforts to ensure that incorrect inter-
pretations by the Appellate Body, including 
with respect to the Agreement on Safe-
guards, the Agreement on Implementation of 
Article VI of the General Agreement on Tar-
iffs and Trade 1994, and the Agreement on 
Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, are 
corrected, and not to be deemed preceden-
tial; 
(C) new rules and norms to address prac-
tices of nonmarket economies, such as prac-
tices relating to state-owned enterprises, 
which certain countries often utilize for ob-
jectives that cause severe trade distortions; 
and 
(D) better implementation of existing 
rules, such as the prohibition in paragraph 4 
of Article XIV of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade on currency manipulation, 
to ensure that those rules are effective to 
preserve the rights of free market econo-
mies.

HONORING MR. RICHARD MORRIS 
BIGGS 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the honorable life and work of a 
beloved Texan, Mr. Richard Morris Biggs. Mr. 
Biggs passed away on February 14, 2021, 
after a full life of almost 77 years. 
Richard Biggs was born in Garden City, 
Michigan on February 15, 1944 to the late Al-
bert and Mae Smallwood Biggs. One of Mr. 
Biggs’ proudest moments was playing basket-
ball for Weatherford College and East Texas 
State University. He was the owner of Autumn 
Homes, and held an office with the Realtor 
Association. Richard is survived by his wife, 
Helen Biggs; children, Brenna Smith and hus-
band Dave Jr., Brian Biggs and wife Karen 
and Anissa Smith and husband James; 10 
grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. He 
will be dearly missed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Mr. Richard Biggs. 
His life was one of service and love for his 
family and friends. He will be missed by all he 
came across, and his legacy will be remem-
bered for years to come.

RECOGNIZING BART WEISMAN AND 
HIS 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
SOUTH 
FLORIDA COMMUNITY 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to honor Barton David Weisman for his years 
of service to our country and the South Florida 
community. Barton, known by most as Bart, 
was born in 1927 in Philadelphia, Pennsyl-
vania and moved to South Florida in 1976 
where he currently resides with his wife Shir-
ley. They have two children and five grand-
children who keep them busy in addition to 
their successful business and philanthropic ac-
tivities. 
In the midst of World War II, Bart enrolled 
in the ROTC program at Lehigh University and 
later joined the New York National Guard. Bart 
was deployed to Korea as part of a medical 
unit with Company K, 47th Infantry Regiment 
which saw extensive combat. Bart was pro-
moted to 1st Lieutenant and received numer-
ous awards for his military service, including 
the Army of Occupation Medal for service in 
Japan, the Korean Service Medal, the UN 
Service Ribbon, and the Combat Medical 
Badge. 
Following his military career, Bart started a 
company providing long term health care serv-
ices to children and seniors. The company 
grew from what was originally one nursing 
home in Bristol, Pennsylvania to operating fa-
cilities in New Jersey and Florida. Bart’s com-
pany continues to be a family-run business 
with both his son and grandson working there. 
Bart and Shirley have dedicated themselves 
to sharing their success with their community 
through various philanthropic activities. They 
focus much of their efforts with Jewish Family 
Services and their most recent endeavor is the 
Shirley and Barton Weisman Delray Commu-
nity and Senior Center in Delray Beach, Flor-
ida which provides an array of vital services 
and resources to the area’s seniors. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Bart Weisman, and his 
service to the South Florida community and 
Florida’s 22nd Congressional District.

Over the past year they have faced chal-
lenges most of us cannot even imagine. They 
have shown incredible resolve in the face of 
adversity. They have shown us all how to 
seek positivity and hope in each day as we 
weather the storms that come our way. 
I couldn’t be more thankful to represent the 
incredible people across South Dakota and all 
over the nation who work hard each day, not 
for fame, not for recognition or for money, but 
for the betterment of their communities. This is 
what makes America strong. I am grateful for 
the opportunity to recognize these hard-
working individuals.

WILLIAM (BILL) ALEXANDER 
MCKEE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize William (Bill) Alexander 
McKee of Golden, Colorado who passed away 
on February 7, 2021. 
Bill was born in Lake Forest, Illinois and 
grew up in Barrington, Illinois. He graduated 
from Barrington High School in 1970 and went 
on to graduate from the University of Denver 
in 1974 with a B.A. in Political Science. In 
1977, he received a Masters of Urban Affairs 
with an emphasis in Budgeting and Adminis-
tration from the University of Colorado. 
In 1979, Bill began his career with the Colo-
rado Department of Health and Environment in 
the Water Quality Division. During his 26 
years at the department, he worked to protect 
the rivers, lakes and streams of Colorado. 
Whether working with grants, permits, regional 
planning, nonpoint source pollution or as the 
Upper Colorado Watershed coordinator, Bill 
realized water pollution was about all of us 
working together and influenced how various 
jurisdictions were expected to comply with the 
Clean Water Act. 
Bill met his wife Suzy through common 
friends in 1978. They married in 1979 at Pine 
Valley Ranch in Pine, Colorado and moved to 
Golden, Colo. soon thereafter. During his 38 
years in Golden, Bill was constantly working to 
improve his community. Bill embraced Golden, 
as he did water. He served from 1988 to 1996 
on the Golden Planning Commission and was 
elected to the Golden City Council from 1996 
to 2004. Bill’s time on both city council and the 
planning commission coincided with important 
changes in the history of Golden. Alongside 
fellow city leaders, Bill worked to revitalize 
downtown and bring more business and tour-
ism to Golden. Many of Bill’s lasting contribu-
tions were to the boards and organizations 
where he served, such as his tenure as presi-
dent of the Friends of the Golden History Mu-
seum and Park. Bill helped shepherd this or-
ganization from a volunteer organization to the 
professionally run museum it is today. For 
many years, Bill also volunteered for the Lead-
ership Golden Alumni Association Board. 
In 2003, Bill joined the board of the Colo-
rado Watershed Assembly. He served on the 
board for 10 years and as the chair for four 
years. Bill helped grow the yearly Sustaining 
Colorado’s Watershed Conference into a top- 
notch multi-day event. He was a guiding force, 
a natural leader, and he saw the value of a 
statewide conference for watershed groups, 
private and government sectors, and con-
cerned citizens to gather and share their mis-
sion of ensuring clean water for all Colo-
radans. 
Bill loved spending time with his family, 
gathering with close friends, hiking with his 
faithful dog Grace, attending local ribbon 
cuttings, attending meetings, attending more 
meetings, following our local sports teams, 
reading the Denver Post daily, skiing the 
steeps, golfing, biking, playing the guitar and 
occasionally his flute, making the best spa-
ghetti sauce ever, enjoying quality scotch 
while smoking a cigar around the fire, whis-
tling, singing to the radio, spending time in the 
mountains of Colorado, and traveling. 
Bill was a devoted husband and loving fa-
ther and grandfather. He is survived by his 
wife, Suzy McKee, their children Meredith 
McKee, Gregory (Kari Hogan McKee); and 
grandchildren, Frances, Ace, and Mac McKee. 
I appreciate and thank him for a lifetime of 
service to our community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
CHILDREN’S MUSEUM ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the National Children’s Mu-
seum Act, which would require the General 
Services Administration (GSA) to enter into a 
cooperative agreement with the National Chil-
dren’s Museum (NCM), a congressionally des-
ignated museum, to allow the museum to re-
main in the Ronald Reagan Building and Inter-
national Trade Center, a federally owned 
building in the nation’s capital, without charge 
for the duration of its existing lease. The Na-
tional Building Museum operates under such 
an agreement. Last Congress, on November 
17, 2020, the House passed this bill by voice 
vote. 
This bill would allow the NCM, the nation’s 
first combination children’s museum and 
science center, to remain centrally located in 
the nation’s capital for the benefit of the mil-
lions who visit and live in the District and the 
national 
capital 
region 
(NCR). 
Originally 
named the Capital Children’s Museum, the 
NCM was a staple in D.C. for decades. The 
institution opened in 1974 in a former convent 
on H Street Northeast. 
In 2003, Congress recognized the immense 
value in having a children’s museum in D.C. 
and officially designated the museum as the 
NCM. Now, the museum is bringing new and 
innovative science, technology, engineering, 
arts and math (STEAM) exhibits to the na-
tion’s capital, building on more than 30 years 
of educating D.C. children and families. De-
spite the many benefits it brings to the nation’s 
capital, the NCM is an outlier. It is the only 
congressionally designated museum expected 
to pay rent in a federal building. 
Importantly, this bill would relieve concerns 
about the ability of the NCM to survive the 
coronavirus pandemic. When the museum re-
opened last year in the Ronald Reagan Build-
ing and International Trade Center, it imme-
diately attracted many visitors from throughout 
the NCR and the nation, but was forced by the 
coronavirus pandemic to close 18 days later. 
At this time, the museum remains closed until 
further notice. Still, the museum has continued 
to offer valuable STEAM resources to our chil-
dren as they navigate these new challenging 
learning circumstances, including over 75 at- 
home experiment and project video programs, 
monthly podcasts, virtual field trips and a Cli-
mate Action Heroes Digital Exhibit, among 
other resources. 
This bill would allow the NCM to remain 
centrally located in the nation’s capital for the 
benefit of the millions who visit and live in the 
District and the NCR. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

HONORING CARLEY DEERY AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Carley Deery from Carlisle High School 
as Iowan of the Week. Carley is a senior at 
Carlisle High School with a passion for ani-
mals. Her father David Deery is a senior fire 
medic at Des Moines Fire Station No. 3. He 
told his daughter a story of resuscitating a dog 
from a house fire using a pet oxygen mask. 
Carley soon learned of the lack of resources 
in having these specialized masks available to 
first responders in Polk County. This story and 
her passion for animals inspired her to launch 
a campaign to purchase much-needed pet ox-
ygen masks for area ambulances. 
Carley immediately went to work with her 
family: baking and selling dog treats, creating 
an online fundraiser and ultimately teaming up 
with the ARL to meet her goal of every ambu-
lance in the metro area having a pet oxygen 
mask. Recently, she was able to present a 
check for more than $2,000 to help make the 
goal a reality. Her work didn’t stop there. 
Carley has continued her effort of not only 
masks, but assisting the ARL in providing 
housing, food and medical care to animals 
who need assistance after a disaster. 
As an animal lover myself Carley’s story is 
inspiring and a testament to how important our

animals and pets are to our community. I am

Carley helped raise the funds for will benefit 
nine different agencies with 22 of them staying 
right here in Des Moines. I am proud to rep-
resent constituents like Carley who truly exem-
plify what it means to be an Iowan. I will con-
tinue to fight in Congress for communities like 
Carley’s to ensure they have the support and 
voice they deserve.

HONORING ROBERT MEEK JR. 
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Robert Meek Jr. who has served as 
my District Director since 2016. 
To put it simply, Bob is a man of both con-
viction and courage. No matter the duty, he 
executes it with poise, a strong dedication to 
service, and with an abiding gratitude for 
those he works alongside. 
As a retired Colonel of the U.S. Army Re-
serve, as the son of a Second Lieutenant who 
served as a B–25 Mitchell bomber copilot in 
World War II, and father of 3 military sons, 
Bob has dedicated his life not only to being an 
advocate for military families, but also serving 
as a strong voice for servicemembers both 
past and present. 
From traveling thousands of miles across 
North Carolina’s Fifth District with me to meet-
ing with countless scores of proud North Caro-
linians who are proud to live there, Bob has 
always acted with a servant’s heart, one of his 
many features that everyone admires. 
I speak for both myself and the staff when 
I say working alongside Bob has been an 
honor. As he enters this new phase of his life, 
may God continue to bless him, his family, 
and the lives of everyone he will continue to 
serve.

IN GRATITUDE TO BLAIR BOWMAN 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an exceptional constituent 
and community leader in Michigan’s 11th Dis-
trict, Mr. Blair Bowman. 
Mr. Bowman is a lifelong Michigander who 
graduated from Farmington High School in 
Farmington, Michigan, obtained his under-
graduate degree from Michigan State Univer-
sity and law degree from University of Detroit 
School of Law. 
In 2005, after following in his father’s foot-
steps by entering the real estate brokerage 
and development field, he built a facility in 
Novi, Michigan, which operates today as the 
Suburban Collection Showplace. This is one of 
a few examples in the country of a truly pri-
vately owned and operated convention and 
exposition center, with nearly two million peo-
ple passing through annually. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic struck, Mr. 
Bowman wasted no time in offering his center 
to be transformed into an alternative care facil-
ity for COVID–19 patients. The U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, Detroit District led the 
250,000 square foot conversion of the Subur-
ban Collection Showplace convention center 
into a medical facility in 15 days, where they 
created a 250-bed space for patients from 
area hospitals. 
Now, the previous regional field hospital is 
hosting one of Oakland County’s COVID–19 
vaccination clinics, helping to defeat this virus 
once and for all. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the outstanding contributions 
Mr. Bowman has made to his community, and 
to our country at large.

HONORING PAUL JEWELL 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer 
these remarks in honor of Paul Wesley Jewell 
of Salem, Virginia, who passed away on Feb-
ruary 17, 2021 at the age of 79. Mr. Jewell 
was a photographer by profession who ac-
tively participated in Salem’s community orga-
nizations. 
Mr. Jewell was born on December 28, 1941 
in Roanoke County to Curtis W. and Ethel 
Starkey Jewell. As a young man, he grad-
uated from Andrew Lewis High School, ex-
celled at athletics, and belonged to the Boy 
Scouts of America. He made the community 
he grew up in his lifelong home. As a profes-
sional photographer, he owned several stu-
dios, including the Deyerle Studio for over 25 
years. After retiring from professional photog-
raphy, Mr. Jewell remained active in the 
Salem area as a member of the First United 
Methodist Church of Salem and of Taylor Ma-
sonic Lodge No. 23 and as a funeral assistant 
at John M. Oakey & Son Funeral Home. 
Mr. Jewell is survived by son Paul ‘‘Matt’’

THANK YOU SKIP MARANEY 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I will always treasure the encourage-
ment of Skip Maraney during my service in 
Congress. 
For many years, he was the mainstay of the 
Breakfast Club on Wednesday at Longworth 
Cafeteria for members of Congress, Capitol 
Police officers, and staffers. 
I appreciate him inviting me to co-perform 
with Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON in 
the Hexagon Theatre political satirical musical 
comedy revue. 
Skip is recognized as an Honorary Resident 
of South Carolina from over twenty years of 
vacationing at Hilton Head Island. 
The following is an official announcement of 
his upcoming retirement issued by the Na-
tional Star Route Mail Contractors Association: 
JOHN V. ‘‘SKIP’’ MARANEY 
Skip Maraney is retiring after 52 years of 
employment as the executive director and 
lobbyist with the National Star Route Mail 
Contractors Association. The Association’s 
office is located at 325 East Capitol Street 
Washington, D.C. 
Skip will be honored for his steadfast and 
loyal service by the Board of Directors of the 
Association at a regional meeting of mem-
bers on April 19, 2021, in Baltimore, Md. 
Skip is the second executive director of the 
Association. The Association is made up of 
over 500 members across the United States 
and U.S. territories, and the Association rep-
resents approximately 1,800 contracts to the 
United Postal Service. 
Members of the Association are inde-
pendent business owners who contract with 
the United States Postal Service to haul 
mail/deliver mail in areas of the United 
States where the Postal Service doesn’t de-
liver. In the rural areas of the county the 
Star Route contractors deliver what is re-
ferred to as the last mile. 
Skip has outlasted 14 Postmaster Generals, 
nine Presidential Administrations, countless 
members of Congress, and countless Postal 
Service transportation managers. Skip has 
attended countless hearings on matters of 
postal reform legislation held by the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government Reform 
and Committee on Ways and Means. Skip is 
known for expertise on all legislative mat-
ters relating to the Postal Service. 
Skip is a true shoe-leather lobbyist. He be-
lieves meeting a member of Congress or a 
committee staffer in person instead of ex-
changing emails, texting, or talking over the 
phone. He claims it is always harder to say 
‘‘no’’ to a person when talking face to face. 
Skip’s genuine smile and firm handshake 
made him distinguishable among the staff 
and visitors in the halls of Congress. Over 
the years Skip was often been mistaken as a 
former member of Congress.

IN RECOGNITION REV. DR. 
BARBARA CAIN 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Rev. Dr. Barbara Cain 
for her service as the Moderator of the North-
ern Neck Baptist Association, Inc. Founded in 
1877, the NNBA now serves 31 churches 
across the Northern Neck of Virginia. Dr. Cain

As Moderator, Dr. Cain established NNBA

Justice. Additionally, she worked tirelessly with 
the Baptist General Convention of Virginia and 
the Lott Carey Baptist Foreign Mission Con-
vention. Under Dr. Cain’s leadership, NNBA 
also received a grant for its Tutorial Advocacy

HONORING MR. CLYDE MOODY 
SIEBMAN 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Mr. 
FALLON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Clyde 
Moody Siebman—a purveyor of Texas history, 
self-anointed Cowboy, avid gun enthusiast, 
legendary lawyer, loving husband, father, 
grandfather, son, brother, uncle, cousin, and 
friend—died March 4, 2021. Though his sud-
den departure leaves a profound void across 
many spectrums, it was in keeping with 
Clyde’s lifelong wish to ‘‘break and not rust’’ 
when his time came for the Lord to call him 
home. 
Born November 26, 1958, in Sherman, 
Texas, Clyde spent his early years in the 
nearby town of Pottsboro. His family then 
moved to Plano, Texas, for his father’s em-
ployment before Clyde graduated from Plano 
Senior High School in 1977. He attended 
Southern Methodist University (SMU), where 
he earned a dual undergraduate degree in 
Business Administration and Psychology in 
31⁄2 years and then a Juris Doctor in 1984 on 
a full scholarship. He earned many distinctions 
during college and law school, including a De-
partmental Distinction in Psychology for his 
work to address mental competency and the 
law. 
While in law school, Clyde met Carol Ann 
Mumm, a fellow SMU law student. They mar-
ried the year after graduation and were 
blessed with a beautiful 35-year marriage. 
They practiced law together before Carol be-
came a judge and were the proud parents of 
beloved daughter, Elizabeth Forrest, who fol-
lowed in their footsteps, became a lawyer, and 
is now a named partner in the firm her father 
co-founded—Siebman Forrest LLP. Clyde’s 
niece, Becca Skupin, joined the firm in 2019. 
Clyde’s 35-year legal career earned him the 
well-deserved recognition of being one of the 
top lawyers in the state of Texas. Board Cer-
tified in Civil Trial Law by the Texas Board of 
Legal Specialization, Clyde had been included 
in the annual Texas Super Lawyers list pub-
lished by Thomson Reuters legal division in 
Texas 
Monthly 
magazine 
since 
the 
list 
debuted in 2003. He maintained an ‘‘AV’’ Peer 
Reviewed ranking (very high to exemplary) by 
Martindale-Hubbell for over two decades, and 
he earned selection to The Best Lawyers in 
America based on his expertise in Patent, 
Trademark, Copyright and Commercial Litiga-
tion. Clyde was named the 2018 Lawyer of the 
Year for Patent Litigation and 2020 Lawyer of 
the Year for Copyright Litigation in Dallas-Fort 
Worth in The Best Lawyers in America. 
Clyde began his federal practice serving as 
a law clerk to the late United States District 
Judge Paul Brown. He traveled throughout the 
district alongside Judge Brown while serving 
the Sherman, Texarkana, and Beaumont Divi-
sions of the Eastern District of Texas. Clyde 
has appeared as counsel in more than 500 
Eastern District of Texas cases. In addition to 
maintaining a robust state court practice 
throughout his career, he regularly rep-
resented clients in the Northern and Western 
Districts of Texas and before the Federal Cir-
cuit and 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Clyde was a frequent lecturer on a variety of 
legal topics and regularly participated in promi-
nent programs and initiatives, including the 
Eastern District of Texas Bar Association, New 
York Intellectual Property Law Association, the 
Sedona Conference, and the Leahy Institute of 
Advanced Patent Studies. He was also a 
member of the delegation of attorneys and 
judges that presented the first patent mock 
trial at Beijing University in China in 2012 
where he delivered a presentation on U.S. trial 
practices at Southwestern University School of 
Law and Political Science in Chongqing, 
China. Clyde served as the current Chairman 
of the Bench Bar Conference of the Eastern 
District of Texas and as Chairman of the Advi-
sory Committee for the Institute for Law and 
Technology of the Center for American and 
International Law in Plano (formerly South-
western Legal Foundation). 
As he did in the legal arena, Clyde made a 
profound impact in public affairs. He was a 
Texas Elector in 2000, serving as a member 
of the Presidential Electoral College in one of 
the closest presidential races in American his-
tory. Clyde also served by way of Guber-
natorial appointment as Chairman of the Gray-
son County Regional Mobility Authority, Com-
missioner of the Red River Interstate Compact 
Commission, Member of the Board of Direc-
tors for the Red River Authority of Texas, and 
as Commissioner of the Red River Boundary 
Commission, where he played a key role in re-
solving the long-time boundary dispute be-
tween Texas and Oklahoma. Clyde also holds 
the unique distinction of being named as Con-
servator of the Riverbend Water Resources 
District by the 82nd Texas Legislature, helping 
to settle a decades-long legal battle over 
water issues in East Texas and Southwest Ar-
kansas. He also played a pivotal role in the 
transition of both Grayson County and the 
state of Texas from Democrat to Republican- 
held majorities. Though a life-long conserv-
ative, Clyde was also respected for working 
across the political aisle when it served the 
public interest. 
Despite his many prominent roles, Clyde is 
probably best known for his personal gen-
erosity, fun-loving spirit, and willingness to 
help others, both great and small. His greatest 
pleasures were hosting gatherings for family 
and friends, barbecuing, stomping around the 
woods, shooting guns, collecting Texas histor-
ical 
memorabilia, 
and 
travel 
adventures, 
whether planned or spontaneous. He and 
Carol gave generously to countless charitable 
organizations, including the Christian Global 
Missions, True Options Pregnancy Center, 
and Preston EMS, among others. They were 
also long-time members of the Church of 
Christ in Sherman and in Pottsboro. 
Clyde is survived by his wife, Carol 
Siebman, daughter Elizabeth Siebman Forrest 
and her husband, John Forrest, and grand-
daughter Kendall Adele. He is also survived 
by his mother, Carol Sue Siebman, mother-in- 
law Florence Mumm, sister Annette Siebman 
Skupin, whom he loved very much, and her 
husband Jon Skupin, nieces and nephew 
Becca, Katie and Sam Skupin, nephews Jo-
seph and Jake Mumm and their respective 
spouses Kristin and Jessi and children Parker 
and Joy, Aunt and Uncle James and Clydene 
Short, and a host of cousins who he remained 
close with through his life—CB Pippin, Jim 
Pippin, Robin Towery, Melanie Qualls, Randy 
Short, and a host of friends and colleagues 
who will miss him very much. He is preceded 
in death by his father Newell Siebman and 
brother-in-law John Mumm.

ing on German Chancellor Angela Merkle’s 
personal mobile phone, to callously calling 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 
a war hero, ‘‘chicken shit’’ and a ‘‘coward.’’ 
Secretary of State John F. Kerry, a long-
time member of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, suggests Israel is an apart-
heid state. By supporting Hamas and its ally 
the Palestinian Authority, Obama and Kerry 
have threatened the lives of Jews around the 
world in the name of human rights for ter-
rorists. 
He doesn’t realize Gaza is occupied by ter-
rorist Hamas intent on killing Israeli chil-
dren until they destroy the Jewish state. 
Kerry thinks Tweeting will stop the Russian 
war on the Ukraine. America is without a 
foreign policy at a dangerous time. 
Obama and Kerry sit on their hands as 
international cyberattacks proliferate rais-
ing security costs for U.S. corporations and 
small businesses, and prices for consumers. 
They allow cyberterrorists to steal national 
security data and threaten the White House, 
NATO, the National Security Agency, the 
Defense Department and other government 
agencies. 
Due to Obama’s total inaction, the U.S. is 
great risk of a crippling cyber doomsday, a 
day when there is no Internet. The president 
gets tough on nuclear enabled North Korea 
for hacking a worthless Hollywood film, 
while he does nothing to prevent such at-
tacks on the national security of our nation 
and military, diplomatic and industrial as-
sets abroad. 
Our country is leaderless on security. Vot-
ers realized this in November and voted for 
change in Congress. Voters want Congress to 
reverse the leaderless Obama administration 
with strategies to prevent the continued de-
cline of the United States that Obama is 
helpless to address. 
Both Obama and Kerry refused to partici-
pate in the Paris rally for liberty in the 
wake of radical Islamic terror attacks on 
press freedom. What are their priorities? 
They won’t participate with the civilized 
world by declaring war on radical Islam. 
What are their values? They are inviting 
more vicious killings of journalists and free-
dom loving people around the world by doing 
nothing. 
Americans, including this writer, symboli-
cally voted for an African American presi-
dent in hopes he could lead our country na-
tionally and internationally and that he 
could put to rest lingering racial issues. 
Racial tensions are greater today than in 
the 1960’s. The world is on the brink of dis-
aster. 
The Obama administration is asleep. The 
president doesn’t want to wake up until his 
term is over so he can proclaim his great sin-
gle accomplishment: Being the nation’s first 
African American president. 
His record is void of any substantive ac-
complishments. 
Congress has considerable work to do bring 
our nation back from the brink of Obama’s 
multiple leadership disasters. I am confident 
Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell (R– 
Ky.), House Speaker John Boehner (R–Ohio), 
and the growing rank of Democrats dis-
gusted by what Obama has done to our coun-
try and the globe can reverse course. 
Congress must realize Obama is no longer 
relevant. He has wasted his opportunity to 
lead. He has lost the confidence of the Amer-
ican people and world leaders. It is Congress 
that must lead. 
In 
1980 
presidential 
candidate 
Ronald 
Reagan debating President Jimmy Carter 
while the economy was in shambles with 
record unemployment, record interest rates, 
and with our nation seen as an international 
laughingstock, told America he was a leader 
who had a plan to bring the country back. 
Recovery, candidate Reagan told the Amer-
ican people, is when Jimmy Carter loses his 
job. 
President Reagan delivered on his prom-
ises. Obama has failed. 
Congress must act immediately to secure 
our country from further cyberattacks and 
threats to Americans and assets at home and 
abroad. 
But real security will not be restored until 
Obama loses his security badge to enter the 
White House. That day cannot come too 
soon.

INTRODUCTION OF HOUSE RESO-
LUTION 
ON 
POSTAL 
SERVICE 
CONTRACT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce a resolution expressing deep concern 
with the U.S. Postal Service’s misguided deci-
sion to issue a contract for new delivery vehi-
cles that fails to meet our nation’s economic 
and climate goals. The Postal Service owns 
and operates the largest civilian vehicle fleet 
with over 200,000 vehicles. Unfortunately, 
most of the fleet vehicles date back to 1994 
and are fuel inefficient, unsafe, carbon emit-
ting and aging. 
Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to the 
letter carriers and all postal workers who must 
face down these challenges all while carrying 
out the herculean, constitutionally mandated 
task of delivering mail to all addresses. 
Yet, major GOP donor, Postmaster General 
DeJoy recently announced that while the Post-
al Service will procure up to 165,000 vehicles, 
only ten percent will be electric powered. In-
stead of building up the Postal Service, DeJoy 
has taken a wrecking ball to the institution, in-
cluding during the 2020 presidential elections. 
I am thankful that President Biden has taken 
executive action to ensure our nation is meet-
ing our climate goals by creating good paying 
green jobs here in the United States. Trag-
ically, the USPS decision takes a major step 
backward. 
That is why this resolution strongly urges 
the Postal Service to freeze the contract until 
a review can be undertaken to ensure there 
was no undue political influence and that the 
contract is consistent with President Biden’s 
executive order and the Paris Climate Accord. 
We cannot squander this opportunity to de-
velop green supply chains here at home that 
will ensure a cleaner, more stable future for a 
burgeoning 21st century domestic vehicle in-
dustry. 
I urge all my colleagues to support this res-
olution.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVID 
WOOLLEY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 9, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sorrow that I rise today to mourn and 
recognize the passing of a bastion of the town 
of Old Lyme, Connecticut and a devoted fam-
ily man, Mr. Dave Woolley. After living a rich 
life not with material possessions, but rather 
with friendship and compassion for all, Dave 
passed away peacefully on January 30, 2021. 
Born and raised in Longmeadow, Massa-
chusetts to Doris and Harry Woolley, he 
moved on from the state shortly after grad-
uating from University of Massachusetts, Am-
herst with a bachelor’s in business administra-
tion in 1955. 
After enlisting in the Navy and honorably 
serving his nation, we in Connecticut became 
blessed with his giving nature when he began 
a new chapter in his life in Hartford, Con-
necticut. Employing his degree from UMass 
Amherst, David first started as a bank officer 
with Hartford National Bank & Trust Co. His 
intelligence and judgment made him a suc-
cess administering business loans within the 
community first in Hartford and then to a new 
position at the Plainfield Bank & Trust Co. in 
eastern Connecticut and then Washington 
Trust in Westerly, Rhode Island. He retired in 
2009. 
While he was rightfully proud of his work— 
as demonstrated by more than 52 years of 
dedication to his profession—it was never 
meant to be his full purpose in life. Always the 
delightful extrovert, he employed his time out-
side of the job to establish the strongest of 
ties in his local community—which to Dave 
also meant expanding family ties. He moved 
permanently to his Old Lyme home in 1989 
where he formed a loving connection to his 
constant friend and companion, Beverly Curry. 
The two of them together in this idyllic shore-
line town were a constant presence in civic, 
political and charitable events. As a candidate 
for Congress, I was lucky enough to benefit 
from their popularity and community connec-
tions when they tirelessly supported my can-
didacy year in and year out. 
Throughout and prior to his permanent resi-
dence in Old Lyme, David was heavily in-
volved in numerous organizations throughout 
the region and state. Most notably, he served 
11 years as a board member to the Con-
necticut Police Academy; 20 years as an affil-
iate of then State Chairman for the American 
Heart Association of Connecticut; and more 
than 45 years as a member across five dif-
ferent chapters in the Rotary Club. Ending his 
tenure as a member of the Niantic Rotary, it 
should not go without mentioning his service 
as President of two of the Clubs, partially 
leading him to earn the Paul Harris Award— 
the highest accolade presented by the Rotary 
Club. 
Always a force of altruism, Dave’s commit-
ment to creating a stronger community truly 
took off once he connected his financial apti-
tude with the township of Old Lyme. Beginning 
in 1994, Dave joined a local party organization 
and was elected shortly thereafter to the 
Board of Finance in 1995. He served in the 
capacity as a finance specialist, helping to run 
the budgets for the town’s essential services. 
His leadership in the town was clear and long 
lasting as he was also elected Chairman to 
the same local party in 2002. Dave led and 
constructed a strong party infrastructure that 
would become this fundamental part of the 
community, establishing hallmark fundraisers 
and further devoting his tenure to expanding 
the locality’s electorate. He served in these 
roles until his latest days, staying active even 
after fully stepping down from leadership posi-
tions in 2019. 
Having dedicated a life of spreading faith in 
the most local ties, the strength of Dave’s in-
terest in family and friends could not be em-
phasized enough. Dave was an incredible lis-
tener and always made time for people, mak-
ing him destined from the start to bring a 
brand of dignity to his community and by ex-
tension, his family. His memory continues on 
through a long list of individuals: his partner 
Beverly; son and daughter-in-law Michael and 
Patricia Woolley and grandchildren Katherine 
and Alexander; stepchildren Laurie, James, 
David, Steven and their families; as well as his 
sister and brother-in-law Patricia and Michael 
Cronin. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to represent 
constituents as honorable and impactful as 
David. While we all mourn his loss, we can at 
least find solace that his story, memory and 
purpose lives on through countless others. I 
ask that the entire House join me in recog-
nizing the life of David Bronson Woolley, also 
never forgetting the importance of building our 
connections with others.
