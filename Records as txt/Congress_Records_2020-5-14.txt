Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MAY 14, 2020 
No. 91 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, guide our lawmakers 
today to think of themselves as Your 
faithful servants eager to do Your bid-
ding. May they strive less for success 
and more for faithfulness, realizing 
that You expect dependability from 
them. 
Lord, give them the wisdom to be-
lieve that though they may plant and 
water the seeds of our Nation’s destiny, 
only You can bring the harvest. As 
they look to You, the Lord of the har-
vest, soothe their doubts and calm 
their fears. And Lord, we thank You for 
the many courageous staffers who en-
able the Senate to function. 
We pray in Your gracious Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask permission to address the Senate 
in morning business for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT 
REFORM 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
an important part of my job—and I 
hope for every Senator—is hearing the 
views, in my case, of Iowans but in the 
case of my colleagues, the citizens of 
their States. But it is not every day 
that we hear about the executive 
branch of government and its bureauc-
racy making an effort to listen to the 
American people. Fortunately, that is 
changing under this administration. 
I have advised the people of Iowa, and 
I am advising them again—and, hope-
fully, my colleagues will have their 
constituents take advantage of it—that 
this 
administration 
in 
January, 
through the White House, put out a 
call to Americans who deal with Fed-
eral regulations to share their ideas on 
how to ensure that those who face reg-
ulatory enforcement have due process 
and get a fair shake. Those ideas will 
now be used to make regulatory en-
forcement fairer. Take advantage of 
this opportunity. 
Americans who face a burden of com-
plying with regulations should have a 
voice in making the process better, and 
I applaud this administration for lis-
tening to the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this pandemic is weighing heavily on 
the American people. Roughly, 1.4 mil-
lion Americans have been infected, 
more than 80,000 have died, and unem-
ployment has not been this high since 
World War II. 
Just a few months ago, millions of 
hard-working men and women were 
thriving and optimistic. They were 
making big plans across kitchen tables. 
Now all of that is in chaos. 
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve 
reports that nearly 4 in 10 American 
households that earn less than $40,000 a 
year had somebody get laid off in the 
month of March alone. This emergency 
is very serious, so the Senate’s re-
sponse has been serious. 
In March, Senate Republicans de-
signed and the full Senate passed the 
CARES Act. It pushed trillions of dol-
lars to working families, job creators, 
and medical professionals. We sent di-
rect cash to almost 130 million Ameri-
cans. We delivered hundreds of billions 
of dollars in paycheck protection loans 
to small businesses, saving tens of mil-
lions of American jobs. We helped 
State and local governments defray 
coronavirus 
costs. 
We 
funded 
healthcare providers and testing. Even 
now, its programs are still taking ef-
fect, still coming online, still helping. 
The Senate took a blank sheet of paper 
and turned it into the largest rescue 
package in history. 
We have taken this crisis seriously, 
but the House Democrats have taken a 
totally different approach. While we fi-
nalized the CARES Act, the House 
parachuted in with miscellaneous lib-
eral demands that were completely un-
related to COVID–19—solar energy tax 
credits, airline emissions. One senior 
House Democrat called the virus a 
‘‘tremendous opportunity to restruc-
ture things to fit our vision.’’ One Sen-
ate Democratic colleague asked: ‘‘How 
many times are we going to get a shot 
at a $1 trillion-plus program?’’ They 
told us exactly what they were up to, 
so we ignored the leftwing wish list and 
stayed serious, and the CARES Act is 
still helping Americans bridge these 
temporary shutdowns. 
So let’s fast-forward to today. The 
Democratic House is still not back in 
Washington. Its constitutional duty

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2432 
May 14, 2020 
stations are still unmanned, but the 
Democrats cannot stop salivating over 
the possibilities for partisan gain. 
Former Vice President Biden says he 
sees this tragedy as an ‘‘incredible op-
portunity . . . to fundamentally trans-
form the country.’’ Biden said it is an 
‘‘incredible opportunity . . . to fun-
damentally transform the country.’’ 
Speaker PELOSI said: ‘‘I see every-
thing as an opportunity.’’ 
A cochair of the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus said: ‘‘For me, the le-
verage is that there is enormous suf-
fering.’’ ‘‘The leverage is that there is 
enormous suffering.’’ There are 80,000 
Americans who have died and more 
than 20 million who have lost their 
jobs. I call that a crisis; they call it le-
verage. 
This week, the Speaker published an 
1,800-page seasonal catalog of leftwing 
oddities and called it a coronavirus re-
lief bill. So here we go again. It in-
cludes a massive Tax Code giveaway to 
high earners in blue States. Working 
families are struggling to put food on 
the table, but the House Democrats are 
prioritizing millionaires on the coasts. 
It 
would 
print 
another 
round 
of 
checks—listen to this—specifically for 
illegal immigrants. Can you believe it? 
We forgot to have the Treasury Depart-
ment send money to people who are 
here illegally. My goodness. What an 
oversight. Thank goodness the Demo-
crats are on the case. 
The Speaker’s bill also tries to use 
the virus as cover to implement sweep-
ing changes to election laws that the 
Democrats have literally wanted for 
years, like forcing every single State 
to embrace California’s sketchy ballot 
harvesting whether they want to or 
not. 
Then there is the cherry on top. It is 
the bold new policy from the Wash-
ington Democrats that will kick the 
coronavirus to the curb and save Amer-
ican families from this crisis. Here it 
is—new annual studies on diversity and 
inclusion within the cannabis industry. 
There is not one study but two of them. 
Let me say that again. The Democrats’ 
supposed coronavirus bill includes tax-
payer-funded studies to measure diver-
sity and inclusion among the people 
who profit off of marijuana. 
The word ‘‘cannabis’’ appears in this 
bill 68 times—more times than the 
word ‘‘job’’ and 4 times as much as the 
word ‘‘hire.’’ Maybe that is just as well 
because when their proposal does try to 
treat the economic crisis, it proposes 
stifling, anti-work policies that would 
only make it harder for Americans to 
get their jobs back. For example, they 
literally propose to raise taxes on 
small business and drain more cash 
from Main Street during a Main Street 
meltdown. So maybe it is best if the 
House Democrats focus on cannabis 
studies and leave economics to the rest 
of us. 
This is a totally unserious effort. 
Even the mainstream media says: 
‘‘Neither this bill nor anything resem-
bling it will ever become law. It’s a 
Democratic wish list.’’ 
Forget about making law; this thing 
even fails as a messaging bill. That is 
what is so remarkable. The House 
Democrats had a blank slate to write 
anything they wanted to define the 
modern Democratic Party—any vision 
for the society that they wanted—and 
here is what they chose: tax hikes on 
small businesses, giveaways to blue 
State millionaires, government checks 
for illegal immigrants, and sending di-
versity detectives to inspect the pot in-
dustry. The House gave itself no as-
signments for 2 months except to de-
velop this proposal. Yet it still reads 
like the Speaker of the House pasted 
together some random ideas from her 
most liberal Members and slapped the 
word ‘‘coronavirus’’ on top of it—an 
unserious product from an unserious 
House majority that has spent months 
dealing itself out of the crisis. 
The House Democrats have been 
missing in action for months. While 
the Senate was passing the CARES 
Act, the Democratic House was on the 
sidelines substantively and literally. 
They had already gone home. Nearly 2 
months later, the Senators are back at 
our 
duty 
stations 
with 
new 
pre-
cautions. We have been back for 2 
weeks. We are holding major hearings 
on the pandemic. We are legislating 
and confirming nominees. Yet the 
House is still at home. And when it 
does contribute, it is not serious. 
The House Democrats have checked 
out of this crisis and left governing up 
to the Senate. They even intend to 
shatter congressional history and jam 
through remote voting so they can con-
tinue to be counterproductive from the 
comfort of their homes. Let me say 
that again. They even intend to shatter 
congressional history and jam through 
remote voting so they can continue to 
be counterproductive from the comfort 
of their own homes. 
Look, here in the real world, the Sen-
ate Republicans are working seriously 
to help the country reopen. The crush-
ing unemployment figures, even with 
the CARES Act, show that no amount 
of Federal spending could substitute 
for the entirety of the U.S. economy. 
We need to be smart, and we need to be 
safe, but we have to find a more sus-
tainable middle ground. 
This week, Chairman ALEXANDER and 
the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions heard from Dr. 
Fauci, Dr. Redfield, and other top ex-
perts on exactly this subject. There are 
at least two big things our Nation will 
need to start recovering: stepped-up 
testing nationwide and legal liability 
protections so that K–12 schools, uni-
versities, charities, and employers are 
not invaded by trial lawyers the in-
stant they unlock their doors. 
On testing, fortunately, the Senate 
has already done a great deal. The ex-
ecutive 
branch 
and 
especially 
the 
States are in the driver’s seat, but we 
have already sent billions of dollars to 
help scale up testing nationwide. On 
legal liability reform, the work lies 
ahead of us. As my Republican col-
leagues and I have made clear, strong 
legal protections will be a hard redline 
in any future legislation. 
That is what is happening here in the 
Senate—serious leadership on a serious 
crisis like we have been doing for 
months. This half of the Capitol is 
doing our job.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, as 
the majority leader just pointed out, 
the Senate has been and will be focused 
on responding to the coronavirus crisis 
in this country in a way that hopefully 
will enable the American people to re-
cover and that will restore our econ-
omy—that will get things back to nor-
mal. As he pointed out, that requires 
dealing with the health emergency as 
well as with the economic emergency 
crisis that has been created by this. 
With respect to the health emer-
gency, the leader pointed out that 
there are literally tens of billions of 
dollars being spent now on vaccine re-
search, on anti-viral therapeutics, and 
on testing. We believe that, in order for 
us to get our economy fully back, we 
have to deal with the health emergency 
in front of us, so dollars have been 
made available—hundreds of billions of 
dollars—to healthcare providers, hos-
pitals, doctors, nursing homes, and pro-
viders who are on the frontlines of this 
crisis and trying to deal with the chal-
lenges it presents every single day. 
That is what we have focused on. In ad-
dition, we have focused on the eco-
nomic crisis and the impact it has had 
on our small businesses and on our 
workers. 
Everything that has been included in 
the bills that have already been passed 
here in the U.S. Senate—now we have 
No. 4—and have been signed into law 
by the President have been singularly

focused on trying to assist people and 
get them through this time as a bridge 
to hopefully get the worst of this be-
hind us and get us to a time at which 
the economy begins to open up again. 
Clearly, the focus was on helping 
families directly, making sure those 
families who particularly needed the 
help the most got some additional fi-
nancial assistance. So checks went 
out—$1,200 per individual, $2,400 per 
married couple, and $500 for each addi-
tional child—as direct assistance. It 
went into the pockets of families 
across this country. 
Then, with respect to workers and 
small businesses, there was the Pay-
check Protection Program, which by 
all accounts has been very, very suc-
cessful. I think the reason for that is 
that businesses across this country rec-
ognize that they, too, want to keep 
their employees employed. They do 
want to keep those jobs, hopefully, 
until that time when the economy 
starts to open up again, so they heavily 
subscribe to this program. 
Interestingly enough, there has been 
a lot of talk on the other side, as there 
usually is—a demagoging of how this 
helps rich people and all of that. Yet 
the average loan in the most recent 
round of PPP funding is about $80,000 
on a payroll of about $28,000. Businesses 
can use that principally for payroll. 
Seventy-five percent has to be used to 
be able to keep their employees em-
ployed, to keep their workers em-
ployed, to keep those jobs there, while 
25 percent has to be used for some fixed 
cost, which might be utilities, which 
might be rent, which might be debt 
service, those types of things. The 
whole purpose of the program is to 
keep workers employed. It is a pro- 
worker program, and it has been from 
the very beginning. 
Then also, for those who through no 
fault of their own have lost jobs and 
have been laid off, there has been a sig-
nificant plus-up in the unemployment 
insurance accounts—to the tune of $600 
per person per week for individuals in 
this country—on top of what their 
States might already pay. There is a 
significant number of dollars being put 
out there for people who have lost jobs 
through no fault of their own. 
These are pro-worker pieces of legis-
lation, pro-unemployed people legisla-
tion. These are pro-small business— 
keeping those small businesses work-
ing out there. Obviously, they are very 
much pro-health emergency—trying to 
drive dollars toward the solutions, the 
cures, the vaccines, the anti-viral 
therapeutics, and the testing that are 
necessary to help us get through this. 
That is what Republicans here in the 
Senate have been focused on for the 
past several months and will continue 
to be focused on in the future. 
As the leader pointed out, the House 
Democrats, who are not here but who, 
remarkably, from afar have evidently 
put together this fantasy wish list of 
things they would like to see accom-
plished—if you can imagine an 1,815- 
page bill, they mention ‘‘cannabis’’ 
way more times than they mention 
‘‘jobs.’’ The amazing thing about this— 
and they will come here and argue that 
the Republicans’ proposals benefit the 
wealthy, benefit the rich. As I just 
pointed out very clearly, it is the oppo-
site that is true, for it has been di-
rected directly at families and work-
ers. Everything we have done has been 
designed to keep jobs, to be very pro- 
worker. 
Yet, in part of the 1,815-page proposal 
that the Democrats have out there, 
they have a couple of tax proposals, 
one of which would deliver 56 percent 
of that tax cut to the top 1 percent of 
the wage earners in the country. This 
is 56 percent of the benefit of a pro-
posal under the House Democrats’ fan-
tasy wish list that would go to the top 
1 percent of the earners in this coun-
try. Now, that doesn’t sound to me like 
something that is very pro-worker or 
that is trying to help people who are in 
the lower income categories, who are 
suffering the most economically as a 
result of the coronavirus crisis. It 
seems, to me at least, like something 
that is sort of a payoff to some of their 
big donors and to the big blue States. 
Nonetheless, that is a feature of the 
1,815-page bill that the leader just de-
scribed and talked about. It is one of 
many features—part of the permanent 
agenda—that has nothing to do with 
solving the crisis in front of the Amer-
ican people right now but has entirely 
to do with an ideological wish list. 
They are all of the things that have 
been on their agenda for a really long 
time, none of which should ever be con-
sidered seriously in terms of dealing 
with the crisis that is in front of us 
right now. 
As 
I 
said, 
responding 
to 
this 
coronavirus crisis has been and will 
continue to be at the top of our agenda 
for the foreseeable future. 
H.R. 6172 
Madam President, in addition to our 
pandemic response, the Senate is also 
focused on the other priorities on 
which the American people are relying 
on us to take care of—from funding the 
government to protecting our Nation. 
This week, the Senate is taking up 
legislation to reauthorize three expired 
provisions of the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act, including the provi-
sion that allows the FBI to wiretap 
lone wolf terrorists—terrorists not af-
filiated with a specific terrorist organi-
zation—and the roving wiretap provi-
sion that prevents the FBI from having 
to seek a new wiretap warrant each 
time a terrorist suspect changes his 
phone number. 
These provisions lapsed in March, 
after the House blocked a temporary 
extension that was passed unanimously 
in the Senate, leaving law enforcement 
and intelligence officials without key 
tools in their anti-terrorism fight. I ex-
pect the Senate will pass this bill 
today, and I hope the House will move 
quickly to send it to the President’s 
desk. 
Every day, our law enforcement and 
intelligence personnel are engaged in 
the difficult and, at times, dangerous 
work of tracking terrorist threats. We 
need to make sure they have the tools 
they need to do their jobs and to keep 
Americans safe. The bill before us com-
bines extensions of these key anti-ter-
rorism tools with new accountability 
measures that will ensure that law en-
forcement is held to the highest stand-
ards when pursuing surveillance of sus-
pected terrorists and foreign agents. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation when we vote on it later 
today. 
REMEMBERING TOM COBURN 
Madam President, I would like to 
take a moment to pay tribute to my 
friend and a former Member of this 
body, Senator Tom Coburn, who died in 
March. 
Tom and I first met in the House of 
Representatives, where we both served, 
and then came to the Senate at the 
same time as part of the class of 2005. 
I have been privileged to meet many 
principled men and women in my time 
in public service, but Tom, literally, 
was one in a million. He was fiercely 
principled and uncompromising, often 
to the chagrin of fellow Senators. He 
didn’t care if he were 1 against 99 if he 
believed he was in the right. He stuck 
to his guns come hell or high water. He 
voted against politically popular legis-
lation and bills that no other Senator 
would oppose. Yet he held the enduring 
respect of his constituents and, indeed, 
of his colleagues, proving that some-
times principle can win you more last-
ing friendship than compromise. He 
was here for a purpose—in particular, 
to protect our children and grand-
children from the burden of an ever-in-
creasing national debt by exposing gov-
ernment 
waste 
and 
Washington’s 
spending habits. 
He got into fierce fights on the floor 
in service to that mission, but he knew 
how to keep fights to the office. Prick-
ly on the floor, outside of it, he was 
warm and personable, and he didn’t let 
politics get in the way of friendships. 
As he once said himself, he disagreed 
with President Obama on 95 percent of 
the issues, but that didn’t stop him 
from developing a lasting friendship 
with the President or from working 
with him on legislation when he was in 
the Senate. 
No discussion of Tom would be com-
plete without mentioning his deep 
faith. He was an outspoken witness for 
Christ. If you were his friend, as I was 
privileged to be, he was interested not 
just in your present good but in your 
eternal good as well. 
As I said earlier, Tom Coburn was 
one in a million, and it will be a long 
time before we see his like again. That 
is a particularly great loss because the 
Senate should always have a Tom 
Coburn—a man or woman of uncompro-
mising principle, of fierce dedication to 
the national good, someone willing to 
stand alone in defense of the right, who 
provides a constant reminder that prin-
ciple is more important than politics

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT
of Florida). The Democratic 
leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has 
been 2 weeks since Leader MCCONNELL 
called us back into session. In that 
time, it was announced that 30 million 
Americans filed for unemployment. 
Just this morning, we learned another 
3 
million 
Americans 
filed 
jobless 
claims this week. Yet the Republican 
leader 
has 
scheduled 
exactly 
zero 
votes—zero—on legislation related to 
the 
coronavirus. 
Instead, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
has resisted urgent and 
necessary action to fight the pandemic. 
He said that now is the time to ‘‘press 
the pause button.’’ Tell that to some-
one trying to feed his or her children. 
Tell that to some small business person 
who has kept a business going for 20 
years and now is ready to go bankrupt. 
Tell that to workers at every level of 
this economy who are losing their jobs. 
Time to press the pause button when 
we have faced the greatest health and 
economic crisis since the Depression? 
MCCONNELL
has 
said 
Republicans 
have yet to ‘‘feel the urgency of acting 
immediately.’’ How many of our Re-
publican Senators have yet to feel the 
urgency of acting immediately? How 
many? I would urge the constituents of 
Senators in every State to call them 
and ask them that question. Do you 
agree with Senator MCCONNELL that we 
have yet to feel the urgency of acting 
immediately? Well, I could give our Re-
publican colleagues more than 30 mil-
lion reasons to feel the urgency of act-
ing immediately. 
We are staring at a period of pro-
longed economic misery for millions of 
American workers and families—Amer-
icans who for the first time don’t know 
if they will be able to keep a roof over 
their heads, put food on the table, pay 
the rent; Americans who for the first 
time are waiting in staggering lines at 
food banks, cars lined up for miles, 
snaked across parking lots, people who 
would never have imagined they would 
be lining up at a food bank. How long 
will it take and how much economic 
hardship will suffice before Senate Re-
publicans feel the urgency to act? 
It is not just Democrats who are 
pleading with the Republican majority 
to wake up to the economic reality in 
this country—oh, no. Governors span-
ning the country in both parties know 
darn well that this is not a blue State/ 
red State issue. How cheap. A fire-
fighter who is laid off in Florida and a 
firefighter who is laid off in New York 
are both hurting, and they are not 
looking to what kind of State they are 
in. So the Governors are calling for 
help. States, cities, and localities are 
being forced to lay off teachers, police 
officers, firefighters, and food health 
safety workers. It is Governors of both 
parties. Listen to the NGA, led by a Re-
publican Governor. They need to get 
unanimous consent for most of the 
things they do. 
It is not just Governors and politi-
cians. The Chairman of the Federal Re-
serve, Jerome Powell—hardly a Demo-
crat—a Trump appointee, said yester-
day that ‘‘the scope and speed of this 
downturn are without modern prece-
dent, significantly worse than any re-
cession since World War II.’’ He went 
on to say that ‘‘additional fiscal sup-
port could be costly but worth it, if it 
helps avoid long-term economic dam-
age and leaves us with a stronger re-
covery.’’ That is the Chairman of the 
Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, appointed 
by President Trump, telling Repub-
licans to get off their hands and do 
something. Powell has used almost 
every tool in his monetary toolkit. He 
knows we need fiscal relief—more of it. 
But Leader MCCONNELL has so far re-
jected doing another emergency relief 
bill. His party is slowly drafting legis-
lation to give legal immunity to big 
corporations that put workers in dan-
gerous situations. 
That is not the nub of the issue. We 
know that. We have so many diversions 
on 
the 
Republican 
side—liability, 
China. Let’s solve the problem right 
now. What are we going to do for peo-
ple who are out of work? What are we 
going to do for people who can’t feed 
their families? What are we going to do 
for businesses that are going under? 
Senate Democrats have had to re-
lentlessly pressure our Republican col-
leagues to hold even the most routine 
oversight hearings on the coronavirus. 
Our Republican colleagues say: Well, 
we don’t want to spend any more 
money; we have to know how it is 
spent. Yet they are not having a whole 
raft of hearings that they should to see 
how the money is spent. Instead, they 
are talking about appointing rightwing 
judges who want to repeal healthcare 
to the bench. Wow. How out of touch. 
The Republican leader made sure the 
Judiciary Committee had time to con-
sider his protege, a rightwing judge, to 
sit on the second most powerful court 
in the country, even though there is no 
particular need for that nomination at 
the moment. 
The chairman of the Senate Home-
land Security and Government Affairs 
Committee told committee members 
that next week he was planning on 
delving into baseless, Kremlin-con-
cocted conspiracy theories against the 
son of Joe Biden, the Democratic nomi-
nee for President. Russia comes up 
with a theory, and the Republicans em-
brace it instead of doing what they are 
supposed to be doing. 
The 
Republican 
majority 
doesn’t 
have time to call in the SBA Adminis-
trator or FEMA Administrator or hold 
a hearing on the shortage of PPE, 
which our workers on the frontline so 
desperately need, but all of a sudden, 
they have time to use a Senate com-
mittee to try to slander the President’s 
political opponent? What world are 
they in? How out of touch can they be? 
We are in the middle of a public 
health and economic crisis, and Senate 
Republicans are diving head-first into 
the muck, pursuing diversionary, par-
tisan conspiracy theories to prop up 
President 
Trump 
when 
President 
Trump should be focusing on solving 
this 
crisis—once 
again 
trying 
to 
achieve what the President tried to 
achieve in the Ukraine scandal by an-
other means, sullying his opponent 
with 
baseless 
conspiracy 
theories. 
Don’t our Republican friends see the 
folly of following President Trump in 
this regard? Don’t they know the 
American people are wise to this kind 
of stuff? There are over 30 million peo-
ple without work, tens of thousands 
losing their lives, and pursuing base-
less conspiracy theories is what the Re-
publican majority seems to be focused 
on. 
Unfortunately, Republicans in Con-
gress aren’t the only ones unwilling to 
do the urgent and necessary work of 
the moment. President Trump and his 
administration are guilty of the same 
offense. Yesterday, Dr. Fauci—one of 
the most respected health experts in 
the country—warned that the reopen-
ing of schools and businesses too quick-
ly could lead to unnecessary suffering 
and death. Asked about Dr. Fauci’s 
comments, President Trump said Dr. 
Fauci ‘‘wants to play all sides of the 
equation. . . . [T]o me—it’s not an ac-
ceptable answer.’’ 
President Trump, Dr. Fauci isn’t 
playing all sides of the equation. He is 
giving you one side of the equation: the 
truth—the truth, President Trump, 
without you lurking over his shoulder 
or contradicting him at a press con-
ference or yelling at a reporter who 
asks a legitimate question. 
We don’t need Dr. Fauci to tell us 
there are risks to reopening too soon 
and without proper preparation. That 
is obvious to just about everyone. That 
is the truth. But President Trump just 
inveterately abases the truth if it 
doesn’t fit with the fantasy he has con-
structed in his head. The first fantasy 
was that it was a hoax. The second fan-
tasy was that it will go away in the 
warm weather. 
Well, here we are. It is May. Has it 
gone away, Mr. Trump? Is it a hoax, 
Mr. Trump? No, of course not. 
Now, one of his latest—that Fauci is 
making things up or is wrong. He will 
rush us back to work before we have 
the proper testing, and we will pay a 
price. That is what the scientists tell 
us, and they know best. They are not 
politicians. 
Thankfully, in this big, grand, di-
verse, and beautiful country, you can-
not suppress the truth for too long. 
Over the past week, a parade of truth 
tellers has begun. On Tuesday, it was

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2435 
May 14, 2020 
Dr. Fauci; on Wednesday, Jerome Pow-
ell; today, HHS official Rick Bright is 
testifying in the House. The President 
may try to shroud the truth from the 
American people or even from himself, 
but eventually, inevitably, the truth 
will come out about how poorly the ad-
ministration has dealt with this crisis. 
It is one of the worst performances by 
a President in American history. 
The American people have been fol-
lowing stay-at-home orders for months 
on end, doing their part to slow the 
spread of this pernicious disease. Those 
many millions who sacrificed their 
routines and livelihoods have bought 
this country precious time to prepare 
for life after the pandemic; precious 
time to ramp up testing, produce PPE, 
and formulate a plan for nationwide 
contact tracing. What has the Trump 
administration done with this precious 
time? They have wasted it—wasted it. 
The President wants to reopen the 
country as quickly as possible but 
could not be less interested in the 
strategies that would allow us to do it 
safely. 
President Trump, do you want to get 
the country open quickly? Do you want 
to get people back to the malls and 
riding on the airplanes? Get the kind of 
testing that other countries have done. 
We are still leagues behind on testing. 
He 
said 
2 
months 
ago—another 
Trump fantasy—on March 6 that any-
one who wants a test can get one. Tell 
that to millions and millions and mil-
lions of Americans who want testing 
and cannot get it. 
A de facto nationwide lockdown has 
been going on for weeks. Yet our test-
ing capacity has not approached the 
number just about every expert says is 
required. The President, in an emer-
gency, which we certainly have, hasn’t 
requisitioned American manufacturing 
to produce the tests we need and has 
been slow to dispense congressional 
funds intended to help the States do 
the job. We voted for those a few weeks 
back. The States are still waiting. 
Businesses, schools, sports leagues, 
and families are going to need guidance 
from public health experts on how to 
open as safely as possible. 
I talked to hotel executives and 
sports 
executives 
yesterday. 
They 
know that without testing, they are 
not going to come back. If they could 
test every person walking into a large 
arena and turn away anyone who might 
have COVID, people would be far more 
likely to sit in the seats. In Georgia, 
where Governor Kemp has been most 
forward, pushing people to open up, 
something like 6 to 8 percent of the 
people showed up. This is 2 weeks after 
he opened up the malls and the stores. 
People are not going to go out unless 
they are sure they won’t get COVID, 
and they can’t be sure they won’t get 
COVID unless we have many, many 
more tests. 
What is the President waiting for? He 
cuts his nose to spite his face. He 
wants to get us back to work, but he 
doesn’t push testing. The anomalies of 
this man—and that is a kind word— 
just go on and on and on. 
People also want to know the guid-
ance—what should they do, what they 
shouldn’t. They want it from sci-
entists. The CDC prepared guidance. 
The President has held it back so that 
he and his political appointees can edit 
it to suit their purposes. 
Yesterday, I tried to ask the Senate’s 
consent to release the unredacted, un-
edited CDC guidance, and Senate Re-
publicans, of course, blocked the re-
quest. The junior Senator from Indiana 
said he didn’t want ‘‘career regu-
lators’’—meaning the experts, meaning 
scientists at the CDC—to advise the 
country on how to reopen safely. That 
the President and his team of political 
advisers should be able to decide that— 
is there anyone left in this country, ex-
cept the most diehard partisans, who 
trusts this administration to issue 
medical guidance properly? Come on. 
Here is the bottom line: The sac-
rifices of the American people gave 
this administration time to prepare the 
country to return to some semblance of 
normal. Those sacrifices have been 
squandered by Trump and his Repub-
lican acolytes. 
We all want to get back to work—I 
certainly do—but there is a smart way 
to begin reopening the country, a way 
to do it safely, with precautions and 
testing and tracing, to avoid a resur-
gence of the disease, and then there is 
a reckless way. President Trump has so 
far chosen the reckless way and seems 
to have no plan to right the ship. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I wanted 
to start by stating that I know a lot of 
people look at us speaking on the floor 
and think, you know, well, why aren’t 
they wearing masks? 
I saw Senator SCHUMER. He put on his 
mask after he finished his talk and 
left. I have my mask here. I just took 
it off. I am going to put it on after I 
finish speaking. 
You know the way this works. I wear 
this mask to protect you, and you wear 
a mask to protect me, and that is the 
way we protect each other in this pan-
demic. I don’t think there is any doubt 
that wearing a mask saves lives, and 
that is how we are going to overcome 
in this pandemic. 
I see people around New Mexico all 
the time when I am back home wearing 
masks and really taking this pandemic 
seriously and taking our Governor’s or-
ders seriously. 
H.R. 6172 
Mr. President, reauthorization of the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 
or FISA, is now before us. We have an 
opportunity to reform this statute, to 
protect both our constitutional rights 
and our security. In the immediate 
aftermath of 9/11, Congress hurriedly 
passed the PATRIOT Act and author-
ized extraordinarily broad authority to 
the Executive and the executive branch 
that threatened America’s and Ameri-
cans’ privacy rights and liberty inter-
ests. 
In October 2001, I was 1 of 66 Members 
in the House of Representatives who 
voted against the PATRIOT Act. It was 
not an easy vote, but in the years 
since, it is clear that it was the correct 
vote because the PATRIOT Act ulti-
mately allowed the government to in-
vade the privacy of millions of inno-
cent Americans. 
Exhibit 1: section 215 of the act. Sec-
tion 215 has been greatly abused, re-
sulting in the bulk collection of hun-
dreds of millions of Americans’ phone 
records and email contact lists. 
The Nation was shocked when we 
found out about this bulk collection in 
2013. In 2015, we passed the FREEDOM 
Act to cure some of the abuses. It did 
not cure them all. 
Section 215 and two other provisions 
of the PATRIOT Act are up for reau-
thorization. That is the bill before us. 
Congress has the opportunity to pro-
tect our civil liberties even as we pro-
tect national security. 
And while the House bill made im-
provements, it is still flawed. The 
House version still allows large-scale 
collection of Americans’ sensitive in-
formation, and it doesn’t reform the 
FISA Courts to prevent abuses. We 
should learn the lesson of October 2001 
and not rush this through the Senate. 
We should include amendments to bet-
ter protect Americans’ civil liberties. 
I support the Wyden-Daines amend-
ment 
that 
prohibits 
collection 
of 
Americans’ internet website browsing 
and internet search history informa-
tion without a search warrant. It is a 
missed opportunity for the Nation that 
the amendment failed yesterday, al-
though by one vote—by one vote. 
Right now, the Federal Government 
can digitally track articles Americans 
are reading online, social media they 
are using, where they are shopping, 
which restaurants they are thinking 
about going to, and the list goes on and 
on. Just imagine thinking about every-
thing you do on the internet and your 
devices. That is open game. 
The Fourth Amendment protects us 
against unreasonable searches. In this 
day and age, when so much of our life 
is conducted over the internet, Ameri-
cans must have assurance that their 
web browsing, which can reveal highly 
sensitive information, will not be un-
reasonably intruded upon by Federal 
authorities without a search warrant 
and without probable cause. This infor-
mation provides an intimate window 
into our lives. It can reveal a person’s 
medical conditions, political and reli-
gious views, and far more. 
We need to make clear that govern-
ment must demonstrate probable cause 
to collect this type of personal infor-
mation. 
Second, we need to strengthen the 
oversight of FISA Courts. We know 
these secret courts are subject to 
abuse. In 2015, Congress authorized 
FISA Courts to appoint amici—friends 
of the court—in cases involving novel

or significant interpretation of the law. 
This was a positive step forward to pro-
vide independent oversight, but it ap-
pears there have been only 16 cases in 
which amici have actually been ap-
pointed. Yet there have been more 
cases than 16 in which novel issues 
were raised and many more cases 
where an independent voice is needed 
to defend civil rights in FISA Court 
proceedings. 
The recent Department of Justice in-
spector general report examining 25 
FISA 
applications underscores this 
need. The IG found errors and inad-
equately supported facts in every appli-
cation. An expanded amicus role is nec-
essary to bring greater accountability 
to the application process. 
I voted in support of the Lee-Leahy 
amendment that expands amici partici-
pation to significant First Amendment 
activities; to matters where a religious 
or political organization, a public offi-
cial or candidate or the news media is 
involved; and to matters approving new 
technology 
or 
reauthorizing 
pro-
grammatic surveillance. 
Third, we must make sure FISA ap-
plications are completely accurate and 
all exculpatory evidence is disclosed. 
Accuracy and transparency are critical 
to maintaining integrity within our 
justice system. 
The Lee-Leahy amendment strength-
ens the requirements for accuracy and 
disclosure of all information—includ-
ing exculpatory information—in FISA 
applications. 
I am pleased this body stood in sup-
port of strengthening safeguards in the 
FISA Court process. However, our fail-
ure to protect Americans from the Fed-
eral Government looking over their 
shoulders while they are on the inter-
net and collecting personal informa-
tion is unacceptable. National security 
does not require the Federal Govern-
ment intruding upon the private lives 
of Americans without probable cause 
and a search warrant. 
Our liberties and freedoms define us 
as a nation. Either we should recon-
sider the Wyden-Daines amendment—a 
motion to reconsider is allowed at this 
point—or we should vote no on FISA 
reauthorization. We don’t need to sac-
rifice our liberties and freedoms for an 
illusion of security. 
One of our Founders way back in this 
country, Ben Franklin, said it a little 
bit differently. He said: ‘‘Those who 
would give up liberty in the name of se-
curity deserve neither.’’ 
REMEMBERING DENNIS CHAVEZ 
Now, Mr. President, before I yield the 
floor today, I would like to commemo-
rate one of New Mexico’s great heroes, 
Senator Dennis Chavez, who, 70 years 
ago this week, on May 12, 1950, stood on 
this floor of the U.S. Senate and was 
the first in the Senate to sound the 
alarm against Senator Joseph McCar-
thy, who had begun his reign of terror 
that year. 
Dennis Chavez was born into a farm-
ing family in territorial New Mexico. 
He had a seventh grade education and 
rose to become a Georgetown Univer-
sity Law School graduate, the first 
American-born Hispanic U.S. Senator 
and, at 27 years, the longest serving 
Hispanic Senator in the history of our 
country. 
Senator Chavez, or ‘‘El Senador,’’ as 
we call him in New Mexico, was a man 
of great integrity. In February 1950, 
McCarthy 
had 
charged—without 
proof—that there were 205 card-car-
rying Communists working in the 
State Department. By March, he ac-
cused American scholar Owen Latti-
more, among others, of being a Com-
munist. That accusation—also without 
evidence—spurred Senator Chavez to 
take to the Senate floor, to come down 
here and to speak out. 
He told the Senate: 
I would like to be remembered as the man 
who raised a voice—and I devoutly hope not 
a voice in the wilderness—at a time in the 
history of this body when we seem bent upon 
placing limitations on the freedom of the in-
dividual. I would consider all of the legisla-
tion which I have supported meaningless if I 
were to sit idly by, silent, during a period 
which may go down in history as an era 
where we are permitted curtailments of our 
liberties, a period when we quietly shackled 
the growth of men’s minds. 
Dennis Chavez. 
The fact is, we are seeing chilling 
similarities between the Joseph McCar-
thy of seven decades ago and the situa-
tion we are in today. 
Mr. President, this week marks the 
70th anniversary of a courageous ad-
dress to this body. Seventy years ago, 
on May 12, 1950, the senior senator from 
New Mexico—Dennis Chavez—was the 
first to call out the unfairness of Joe 
McCarthy’s communist witch hunt. 
In May of 1950, it was still four and 
one-half years before the Senate would 
vote to ‘‘condemn’’ the senator from 
Wisconsin. But, even at that time, 
early in McCarthy’s crusade, Senator 
Chavez recognized the present danger. 
That day, Senator Chavez took to the 
floor, with 77 other Senators in attend-
ance. That was a time when Senators 
engaged in genuine, spontaneous de-
bate in this chamber. Senator Chavez 
counseled his colleagues: ‘‘. . . a man is 
ultimately remembered by what he 
does in relation to his times, and the 
fact that we do our assigned duty may 
not be enough; sometimes we must step 
out and sound the alarm.’’ 
And sound the alarm against McCar-
thy, he did. 
Dennis 
Chavez—born 
Dionisio 
on 
April 4, 1888—came from humble and 
honorable beginnings. He came from 
generations who had farmed in Los 
Chavez—a small community along the 
Rio Grande, south of Albuquerque, in 
territorial New Mexico. When he was 
seven, his family moved to Albu-
querque in search of better opportuni-
ties. He learned English in school but, 
at age 13, when he was in 7th grade, he 
had to leave school to help support his 
family. 
Dennis, however, never left his edu-
cation. He studied engineering, Amer-
ican history, and great political leaders 
at the Albuquerque Public Library. In 
his early 20’s, he worked for the City of 
Albuquerque Engineering Department, 
and also became active in Democratic 
politics. He joined the Democratic 
Party, even though most Hispanics at 
that time in New Mexico were Repub-
licans. He saw in the ‘‘Democratic 
party 
a 
political 
philosophy 
that 
placed human rights above property 
rights.’’ 
In 1917, a newly elected Democratic 
Senator from New Mexico took Dennis 
to Washington where he worked for the 
clerk of the Senate. Dennis took and 
passed the entrance examination for 
and eventually graduated from George-
town University Law School—all with 
less than a 7th grade education. 
He returned to New Mexico to prac-
tice law, and was first elected to the 
U.S. House of Representatives—rep-
resenting New Mexico’s one at-large 
district—in 1930. In 1935, he was ap-
pointed to a Senate seat that had be-
come vacant, and was elected in his 
own right the next year. Senator Cha-
vez served in the Senate until his death 
in November 1962. 
In so many ways, he was far ahead of 
his time. In the 1940s, he fought for 
civil rights legislation. In the 1950s, he 
chaired the Public Works Committee 
and sat on the Appropriations Com-
mittee, and helped usher in major in-
frastructure projects all over the na-
tion, including water and military 
projects critical to New Mexico’s devel-
opment. 
‘‘El Senador’’, as we call him in New 
Mexico, was the first American-born 
Hispanic elected to the Senate and, at 
27 years, remains the longest serving 
Hispanic Senator in history. 
Joseph McCarthy began his reign of 
terror on February 9, 1950, a speech 
charging, without proof, that there 
were 205 card carrying members of the 
Communist Party working in the U.S. 
State Department. 
By March of that year, McCarthy had 
accused American scholar Owen Latti-
more, among many others, of being a 
Communist. That accusation, again 
without evidence, was too much for 
Senator Chavez and it gave rise to his 
denunciation on the floor of the Sen-
ate. 
At that time, in 1950, Republicans 
held the presidency and both houses in 
Congress. And no matter one’s party— 
bucking any anti-Communist senti-
ment could be politically costly. 
But Senator Chavez took his chances 
against Joe McCarthy—in the name of 
what was right. 
He told the Senate that day, ‘‘I would 
like to be remembered as the man who 
raised a voice—and I devoutly hope not 
a voice in the wilderness—at a time in 
the history of this body when we seem 
bent upon placing limitations on the 
freedom of the individual. I would con-
sider all of the legislation which I have 
supported meaningless if I were to sit 
idly by, silent, during a period which 
may go down in history as an era where 
we are permitted curtailments of our

liberties, a period when we quietly 
shackled the growth of men’s minds.’’ 
Dennis Chavez’s entire career is de-
fined by his courage, by his integrity, 
by his commitment to justice. 
The 
similarities 
between 
Joseph 
McCarthy and Donald Trump between 
McCarthyism 
and 
Trumpism 
are— 
chilling. Both are demagogues. Both lie 
to the American people. Both try to de-
stroy reputations and lives based on 
falsehoods. 
But the lessons learned from that 
dark period in our history are lessons 
we can all learn from today. 
First—is the lesson of courage. 
In 1950, there were few—of any polit-
ical party—willing to go up against 
Senator McCarthy. 
But there were exceptions. Less than 
a month after Senator Chavez’s floor 
speech, 
the 
junior 
senator 
from 
Maine—Margaret 
Chase 
Smith—the 
first woman to serve in both the House 
and Senate—delivered her ‘‘Declara-
tion of Conscience’’ on the Senate 
floor. Joined by six other brave Repub-
licans, the ‘‘Great Lady of Maine’’ de-
nounced the ‘‘hate and character assas-
sination sheltered by the shield of con-
gressional immunity.’’ 
Where is that courage now? There are 
those in the Senate majority who un-
derstand the incompetence of this 
president. That he has an uneasy rela-
tionship with the truth. That his words 
and actions so often undermine basic 
American values. 
But so few ever speak out. No one 
challenges his lies, his divisiveness, his 
singular focus on his own ambition to 
the exclusion of the welfare of Amer-
ican people. 
In 1950, there were seven Senate Re-
publicans 
who 
challenged 
Joseph 
McCarthy. 
In 2020, who has the courage to stand 
up to say, ‘‘The Emperor has no 
clothes’’? 
Second—is the lesson of truth-tell-
ing. 
Senator 
McCarthy—and 
his 
chief 
counsel 
and 
chief 
henchman, 
Roy 
Cohn—stacked lies upon lies, wild ac-
cusations upon wild accusations. They 
attacked hundreds of government em-
ployees, those in the entertainment in-
dustry, academics, and labor-union ac-
tivists. 
Careers were destroyed. Reputations 
damaged. Lives devastated. 
Is this much different than what the 
President does to those who question, 
disagree with, testify against him? 
The 
impeachment 
proceedings 
against President Trump may seem 
distant now. But history will remem-
ber 
them. 
Ambassador 
Marie 
Yovanovitch, Lieutenant Colonel Alex-
ander Vindman, Ambassador Bill Tay-
lor, Deputy Assistant Secretary George 
Kent, Fiona Hill, Pentagon official 
Laura Cooper, State Department offi-
cial David Holmes, OMB official Mark 
Sandy—all told the truth. Stood up to 
the President and his threats. And all 
are American heroes. 
There is a direct line between Joe 
McCarthy and Donald Trump: they 
chose the same lawyer, Roy Cohn. And 
the President’s threats to the brave 
men and women who testified are right 
out of Roy Cohn’s playbook. 
Third—is the lesson of demagoguery. 
Joe McCarthy was a demagogue. His 
anti-communism met the times. He 
played upon and stoked fear. And he 
accused those who spoke out against 
him of disloyalty to the nation. 
As Senator Chavez so eloquently put 
it on the Senate floor that day: ‘‘We 
have embarked upon a course which 
breeds 
hysteria 
and 
confusion—a 
course so dangerous that few dare to 
oppose the drift lest they be the next 
marked for destruction.’’ 
But 
before 
us 
today—is 
Donald 
Trump—and his demagoguery is even 
more dangerous. He too plays upon 
fear—and anger. He accuses the free 
press of being ‘‘enemies of the people.’’ 
He rails against immigrants invading 
our country, stoking hatred and rac-
ism. 
He promises working class Americans 
greater prosperity. 
But, in the end, he gives the tax 
breaks to the rich, uses the office for 
personal gain, and ignores the needs of 
everyday Americans. 
And—in the middle of the most dev-
astating pandemic our nation has faced 
in a century—he’s told the American 
people no one saw a pandemic was com-
ing, that it’s a hoax, that the virus will 
‘‘magically’’ disappear, that we have 
the best testing system in the world all 
while promoting snake oil remedies 
that could actually harm Americans. 
But—the American people are not 
fooled. They see the emptiness of his 
promises, the division he sows, and the 
lies he tells. 
Seventy years ago, Senator Chavez 
said: ‘‘It matters little if the Congress 
appropriates hundreds of millions of 
dollars to check the erosion of soil if 
we permit the erosion of our civil lib-
erties, 
free 
institutions, 
and 
the 
untrammeled pursuit of truth.’’ 
Those words resonate as much today 
as they did then. 
Members of Congress, of this body— 
must not permit the erosion of our con-
stitutional institutions, must not per-
mit the erosion of truth. 
Now—more than ever—we must as-
pire to the courage of Senator Chavez. 
History will be the judge—by reward-
ing courage and exposing cowardice. 
I will finish with one passage from 70 
years ago. Senator Chavez said: 
It matters little if the Congress appro-
priates hundreds of millions of dollars to 
check the erosion of soil if we permit the 
erosion of our civil liberties, free institu-
tions, and the untrammeled pursuit of truth. 
That is our own Senator from New 
Mexico, Senator Dennis Chavez. Those 
words resonate as much today as they 
did then. 
I see my good friend Senator PAUL is 
here on the floor, so I believe he is the 
next in line. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1586 
Mr. PAUL. The PATRIOT Act was 
begotten of the most unpatriotic of 
ideas—that liberty can be exchanged 
for security. The history of the PA-
TRIOT Act shows that the exchange is 
a poor one. 
As our liberty wanes and wastes 
away, we find that the promises of se-
curity were an illusion. The history of 
the PATRIOT Act is really a history of 
how power corrupts and how bias and 
malfeasance grow when power is un-
checked. 
The PATRIOT Act allowed a secret 
court, FISA, to grant generalized war-
rants to collect personal data from 
millions of Americans. The spies who 
run these surveillance programs then 
lied—for years and years—to us. 
One of the most notorious of these 
liars was James Clapper. When cross- 
examined 
under 
oath 
by 
Senator 
WYDEN, James Clapper denied that the 
government was collecting data on 
millions of Americans. 
A month later, the whistleblower, 
Edward Snowden, revealed that Clap-
per had lied. Snowden revealed that 
Clapper and others were using the PA-
TRIOT Act to spy on virtually every 
American. Snowden revealed that the 
secret FISA Court was allowing a sin-
gle court order to command the collec-
tion of millions of Americans’ personal 
phone data. 
Most Members of Congress had no 
idea that this was going on. In fact, 
one of the authors of the PATRIOT Act 
publicly expressed his shock that such 
a massive surveillance of Americans 
was occurring with no notification of 
Congress. 
Clapper and others, though, said that 
is not true. They justified their actions 
by saying: We have been briefing the 
Elite 8 Congressmen. 
Who were the Elite 8, and who made 
them elite? The Elite 8 are the major-
ity and minority leaders of the House 
and the Senate and the majority and 
minority leader of the Intelligence 
Committees of the House and the Sen-
ate—eight people. 
When they were quizzed about this 
program, most of them said they 
couldn’t remember ever being briefed 
on it. 
But the real constitutional question 
is, have we not changed and subverted 
the Constitution to make eight people 
more important than the rest of us? 
So this was a program where they 
were collecting the data on everybody’s 
phone calls—everybody in America— 
and you would think there would have 
to be a debate and approval by Con-
gress, but there were only eight people, 
and those eight people seemed to be 
confused that they had approved the 
program as well. 
The idea that a single court order 
can allow the collection of personal 
data from millions of people is anti-
thetical to the intentions of the Fourth 
Amendment. 
The 
Fourth 
Amendment 
dictates 
that the government must identify an

individual and the items and the loca-
tion 
to 
be 
searched. 
The 
Fourth 
Amendment was intended to forbid 
general warrants or writs of assistance 
that, historically, Monarchs had used 
indiscriminately 
to 
collect 
vast 
amounts of either belongings or posses-
sions of individuals. 
The Fourth Amendment was written 
to prevent that from happening. 
The PATRIOT Act essentially allows 
for generalized warrants and the bulk 
collection of personal data. The Fourth 
Amendment also dictates that a search 
can only occur when the government 
proves to a judge that there is probable 
cause that a crime has been com-
mitted. However, under the PATRIOT 
Act they have lowered the standard. 
So there is the constitutional stand-
ard—the 
Fourth 
Amendment. 
But, 
under the PATRIOT Act, the standard 
now becomes if it is relevant to an in-
vestigation. That is a much looser, 
broader standard, and it is not a con-
stitutional standard. 
So the question is, Through these 
special, secret courts and through the 
PATRIOT Act, can we allow things 
that the Constitution actually pre-
vents. What we have done is eroded 
protections for Americans. 
So some of us have said the Constitu-
tion should still apply to Americans. If 
you want to look at the data of for-
eigners or spy on foreign countries or 
potential terrorists, by all means, do 
it, but Americans should still be pro-
tected by the Constitution. 
The PATRIOT Act doesn’t provide 
this protection and allows anybody to 
be investigated if the government can 
prove that it is relevant to an inves-
tigation. That standard is so broad 
that it could mean almost anything. It 
is hard to imagine something that 
could not be argued to be relevant to 
an investigation. 
To those of us who prize the rights 
guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, the 
PATRIOT Act is a violation of our 
most precious rights. The PATRIOT 
Act, in the end, is not patriotic. The 
PATRIOT Act makes an unholy and 
unconstitutional exchange of liberty 
for a false sense of security. I, for one, 
will oppose its reauthorization. 
Today we are also here, though, to 
discuss the FISA Court that interacts 
and uses some of these extra powers, 
these extraconstitutional powers. 
It has been revealed over the last few 
years that the FISA Court was manipu-
lated, lied to, and ultimately condoned 
the investigation of a political cam-
paign. 
I believe that the authors of the 
FISA Court, who intended to restrain 
unconstitutional searches, would be ap-
palled at what the FISA Court has be-
come. They would be appalled that this 
secret court intended to be used to in-
vestigate foreign spies and terrorists 
was 
turned 
into 
a 
powerful 
and 
invasive force to infiltrate and disrupt 
the political process. 
It should not matter whether you are 
a Democrat or a Republican or a Liber-
tarian; we should all be appalled at this 
abuse of power. 
The question is, How do we fix it? To 
my mind, there are two approaches. 
No. 1, we could try to make the FISA 
Court less bad by adding procedural 
hurdles to make it more like a con-
stitutional court or, No. 2, admit that 
the FISA Court cannot be made con-
stitutional, admit that FISA uses a 
less-than-constitutional standard when 
it allows searches to be performed that 
do not meet the Fourth Amendment. 
The 
Fourth 
Amendment 
requires 
probable cause that you have either 
committed a crime or are committing 
a crime. The FISA Court only says the 
government must prove or assert that 
there is probable cause that you are 
connected to a foreign government. 
As we have seen, the standards were 
so lax that when they went to the 
Trump campaign and said that a cer-
tain person was related to a foreign 
government, it turns out it was untrue. 
They didn’t present facts to the court 
that actually argued that he wasn’t an 
agent of the foreign government, and 
that person had no one to argue for 
him. 
The deficiency of the FISA Court and 
why it is not constitutional is that you 
don’t get a lawyer. You actually don’t 
even get told you have been accused of 
a crime. The only reason we know that 
President 
Trump’s 
campaign 
got 
caught up in this is that he won. Be-
cause he won and now has the power to 
open and put sunlight on this, we are 
now able to see in. 
If this had been an ordinary Amer-
ican caught up in this, you would never 
be told, you would never get a lawyer, 
and you would be brought before this 
investigative body and subjected to a 
search of vast amounts of your private 
information without probable cause. 
That is not constitutional, and I don’t 
think we can make it constitutional. I 
think we should admit that we can’t 
constitutionally allow Americans to be 
subjected to a search that doesn’t fol-
low the Fourth Amendment. 
I believe there is no fixing the FISA 
Court to make it constitutional for 
Americans. I believe the only solution 
is to exempt Americans from the FISA 
Court. 
If government wants to investigate a 
political campaign, which should be a 
very rare and a very unusual cir-
cumstance, to have the government in-
volved in a political campaign, govern-
ments should request a Fourth Amend-
ment search from an article III con-
stitutional court. 
Some will say: Oh, it is hard; we will 
never get it. Guess what—even con-
stitutional warrants are mostly grant-
ed. The vast majority of them are 
granted. But guess what—a judge will 
be a little reticent to get involved in 
the political process because they 
know how heated it is and how impor-
tant it is to our Republic. But that is 
the way you should investigate a cam-
paign if you are going to. 
Opponents of doing the tried and 
trusted constitutional way will argue 
that it takes too long and it is too 
hard. But guess what—the Constitution 
was meant to be an onerous standard. 
The Constitution was meant to be rig-
orous. Our Founding Fathers under-
stood that justice cannot be achieved 
in secret courts that neither notify the 
accused nor let the accused have legal 
representation. You can’t find justice 
where there is no adversarial process, 
where you don’t get a lawyer. 
I think it is high time we quit letting 
fear overrun our constitutional duty. 
Today, I offer an amendment that re-
stores the Constitution for all Ameri-
cans and forbids the secret FISA Court 
from ever again meddling in our polit-
ical process. 
Mr. President, I call up my amend-
ment No. 1586 and ask that it be re-
ported by number. 
The

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 849 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
rise today on behalf of the 74 fallen 
Vietnam veterans our government has 
forgotten known as the Lost 74. 
On June 3 of 1969, the USS Frank E. 
Evans was participating in a training 
mission 100 miles from the Vietnam 
war combat zone, having been sent 
there in between combat missions; that 
is to say, neither coming nor going. 
During the night, the ship collided 
with an Allied aircraft carrier and 
sank, killing 74 sailors. Remember, this 
is just outside of the combat zone, be-
tween combat missions. 
These 74 Vietnam veterans died in 
service to our country. The ship had 
served on several combat tours and had 
many more scheduled. The Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial on the National 
Mall here in Washington, DC, memori-
alizes over 58,000 military members 
who paid the ultimate sacrifice during 
the Vietnam war by displaying their 
names on its wall. 
People from around the world come 
to see the memorial and pay their re-
spects to those who fought and died for 
the freedoms we all hold dear. 
Yet, because of a technicality, the 
names of the Lost 74 sailors are ex-
cluded from the Vietnam Veterans Me-
morial. As requirements now stand, 
veterans must have perished in or on 
their way to a combat zone. Since the 
Frank E. Evans was participating in a 
practice exercise in between stints in 
fighting off the Vietnam coast, the 
names of these sailors have been left 
off of the wall. 
Imagine that. These sailors, deployed 
overseas in the service of our Nation— 
they left their homes, their families, 
their friends, and their loved ones on 
behalf of our Nation. They paid the ul-
timate sacrifice, like every other man 
and woman who was lost. Yet their 
names have been left off the iconic me-
morial constructed in their honor. As a 
parent, I can’t imagine the pain that 
some of these families must have felt. 
I first learned of this injustice during 
a talk radio townhall in 2018, when a 
family member of Fargo resident and 
Frank E. Evans survivor Dick Grant 
called in to the program. 
After hearing his story, I learned 
about one of his shipmates, Robert 
Searle, a fellow North Dakotan from 
Grand Forks, who was also on board 
the ship and perished in the accident. 
Robert enlisted in the Navy Reserves 
in 1967 and reported to the Frank E. 
Evans in May of 1968. Later that year, 
he married his wife, Thelma. 
Robert was on watch in the forward 
fire room with three other men when 
the collision occurred. All four were 
killed. His twin sons were just 4 
months old. 
North Dakota paid a great price 
when the USS Frank E. Evans sunk. 
Yet my State does not grieve alone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2440 
May 14, 2020 
The Lost 74 encompasses sailors from 
29 different States, and the bill before 
us today represents that diversity, 
spanning the political aisle. 
Before I ask for unanimous consent, I 
would like to yield some time to the 
distinguished Senator from New York, 
the Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
will be brief because I know my col-
leagues wish to join in this wonderful 
activity here to try and get good rec-
ognition. 
I join my colleague from North Da-
kota in strong support of a cause near 
and dear to my heart: the effort to add 
the names of 74 sailors to the Vietnam 
War Memorial who perished in a train-
ing accident that sunk the USS Frank 
E. Evans in June of 1969. 
As my friend from North Dakota ex-
plained, the names of the 74 who died 
on the USS Frank E. Evans have been 
omitted because they died just outside 
of the combat zone, but they had seen 
the heat of battle in Vietnam. The USS 
Frank E. Evans had been part of the Tet 
offensive and was scheduled to return 
to the combat zone before sinking. 
That these men’s lives ended in the 
tragedy of a training accident rather 
than in the line of fire makes no dif-
ference in the final analysis. They went 
off to war and laid down their lives in 
the service of the country they loved. 
I was fortunate to know Larry Reilly, 
Sr., of Syracuse, NY—known to us as 
Chief Reilly, who was serving on the 
Frank E. Evans alongside his son, Larry 
Reilly, Jr., on that fateful day in 1969. 
Larry Sr. survived that day. Junior did 
not. 
For the rest of his life, Chief Reilly 
petitioned his country to give his son 
and his fellow shipmates the very least 
it could give to them—due recognition. 
I sat in Chief Reilly’s living room, 
and I have sat on Maryann Buettner’s 
back porch and listened to her tell me 
all about her son, Terry Lee Hender-
son, who had also seen combat in Viet-
nam and also died in that awful acci-
dent. 
Chief Reilly passed away 2 years ago 
this month, but his cause does not die 
with him. These were living, breathing 
boys who lost their lives wearing the 
uniform of this great country. To in-
scribe their names on a memorial is 
but a small measure of peace for the 
families they left behind, the rightful 
act of a nation that recognizes the sac-
rifices of all its sons. 
I yield to my colleague from New 
Hampshire. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
am here to add my voice to the elo-
quence of both Senator CRAMER and 
Senator SCHUMER about the need to 
recognize those people who were lost 
on the Frank E. Evans. 
We had two sailors from New Hamp-
shire who were lost that day: Ronald 
Arthur Thibodeau of Manchester, NH, 
joined the Navy in 1967, and he was as-
signed to the Frank E. Evans as radar-
man. Ron was on watch during the col-
lision, and he was lost at sea, leaving 
behind a young son. 
And Gary Joseph Vigue, of Farm-
ington, NH, was also on watch that 
night during the fatal collision. Gary 
had married his high school sweetheart 
a few weeks before he reported to the 
Frank E. Evans in 1968. Gary also left 
behind a young son and his two broth-
ers who still live in New Hampshire. 
These two men, Gary and Ron, gave 
their lives for this country. These men 
were supporting operations during the 
Vietnam war, and they were planning 
to return to Vietnam waters once the 
training exercise was over. So, just like 
all those other people who were lost in 
Vietnam, they gave their lives for this 
country. And just because they were 
outside some artificially designated 
combat 
zone 
doesn’t 
mean 
they 
shouldn’t be recognized in the same 
way the others who were lost in Viet-
nam have been recognized. 
Now, this is May, the month of May. 
Memorial Day is approaching, a day 
during which our Nation honors the 
men and women who have died while 
serving in the U.S. military. As we rec-
ognize the sacrifices of our fellow 
Americans, I think it is appropriate 
that the Senate take up and pass the 
U.S.S. Frank E. Evans Act, legislation I 
am honored to cosponsor with my col-
league Senator CRAMER from North Da-
kota because it is legislation that will 
ensure the 74 men—those Lost 74—are 
rightfully honored by adding their 
names to the Vietnam War Memorial. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure. I thank the Presiding Officer 
and Senator CRAMER for this effort to 
ensure that the Lost 74 are recognized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. 
CRAMER. 
Madam 
President, 
whether 
North 
Dakotans, 
Granite 
Staters, or New Yorkers, these stories 
are very moving. 
When I first heard from Mr. Grant’s 
family, I was a Member of the House of 
Representatives. I looked into his re-
quest and introduced an amendment to 
the 2018 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act to inscribe the names of the 
Lost 74. 
While 
the 
measure 
unanimously 
passed the House, it was blocked here 
in the Senate. So, when I came to the 
Senate last year, introducing this leg-
islation was one of my very first ac-
tions and high priorities. 
And I have had some success. We 
have 20 cosponsors—10 Republicans and 
10 Democrats—including the chairman 
and the ranking Democrat on the sub-
committee that has jurisdiction. When 
Members from Montana to Maine, 
North Dakota to New Hampshire, and 
New York can come together on an 
issue as important as honoring the fall-
en sailors, I would hope this would gar-
ner some attention—and it has. It has. 
Last summer, the U.S.S. Frank E. 
Evans Act received its first-ever hear-
ing before a Senate Energy Sub-
committee. I thank the chairman and 
my colleague from Alaska for pro-
viding the opportunity for the story of 
these sailors to be heard. 
It was there when I first heard oppo-
sition to the bill, however. I have yet 
to hear any real opposition to the leg-
islation voiced by anyone except the 
bureaucrats and special interests that 
would actually be charged with car-
rying it out. In other words, nobody ob-
jects to this except the people who 
would have to do something about it, 
and that is a common theme in this 
town, I have noticed. 
For example, the Acting Director of 
the National Park Service said of the 
bill: ‘‘If passed, it would necessitate 
substantial modification of the Viet-
nam Veterans Memorial wall as it ex-
ists today.’’ No kidding. Of course it 
does. That is the point of the bill. 
The idea that we should continue to 
turn a blind eye to forgotten veterans 
because the work would be substantial 
is offensive. It is certainly offensive to 
the shipmates and the families and the 
survivors of the Lost 74. 
Forgive my lack of sympathy for bu-
reaucrats who feel inconvenienced by 
the death of 74 war heroes. The country 
that landed man on the Moon the very 
same year that this accident happened 
certainly can figure out how to fix a 
wall to honor these war dead. More to 
the point, shouldn’t we be looking for 
more ways to honor our fallen rather 
than fewer? 
The opposition’s argument simply 
does not add up. Since the wall was 
built, hundreds of names have been 
added, and more work still needs to be 
done. According to the Washington 
Post, one soldier’s name was etched 
three times. Thirteen soldiers had their 
names etched twice. While the wall 
bears 58,390 names, they represent 
58,276 different people. The Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial Fund, which is re-
sponsible for the wall, conducted a 
study which showed that flaws exist 
with names etched in the memorial. To 
think that we would not add the names 
of the Lost 74 when we know correc-
tions already need to be made seems 
counterintuitive, if not downright lazy. 
Yet, despite all of this, despite the 
veterans being forgotten, despite this 
legislation being sent here twice by the 
House, despite a successful hearing on 
the bill, progress in the Senate has 
stalled. That is why my colleagues and 
I have asked the Department of De-
fense to address this issue as well. 
The Department has a mixed, if not 
negative, record with this issue. They 
tell you what you want to hear until 
you go away and hope you never come 
back. Similar to this body, we have 
been met with complete silence—not a 
yes, not a no, not a maybe, not a sug-
gestion to make the proposal better. 
We find their silence unacceptable; 
therefore, I am going to ask for unani-
mous consent to pass the Frank E. 
Evans Act. The Lost 74, their loved 
ones, and their shipmates have waited 
long enough. No matter how it can be 
spun, the choice before this Chamber is

to give the veterans the recognition 
they deserve or to stand in their way. 
Madam President, with that, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 849 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration. I 
ask unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, I have the 
honor to serve as the chairman of the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee, which does have jurisdiction 
over S. 849, the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans 
Act, but in that capacity as chairman, 
I now have the unenviable position of 
having to rise to register an objection 
at this moment. 
I want it to be clear to my colleague 
from North Dakota, my colleague from 
New Hampshire, my colleague from 
New York, and all of those for whom 
this is a measure on which they are 
seeking this legislative endorsement— 
know that I have the absolute highest 
regard for the men and women who 
serve our country and the sacrifices 
they have made for all of us. 
As the Senator from New Hampshire 
just mentioned, as we approach Memo-
rial Day, I think what we seek to do is 
to try to find ways to honor more of 
those who have served our great Nation 
and a recognition that those who lost 
their lives on the Frank E. Evans de-
serve a form of recognition—a recogni-
tion of all those who lost their lives in 
Vietnam. The story that has been re-
layed by colleagues here of the USS 
Frank E. Evans is truly one of the most 
tragic that occurred during the Viet-
nam war. I am absolutely sympathetic. 
I have had these discussions with my 
colleague Senator CRAMER. I appreciate 
the efforts that he is making now and 
that he has made prior to his time here 
in the Senate to recognize these sailors 
who gave their lives in the incident. 
The reality that we face in the En-
ergy 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Com-
mittee—again, we are the committee of 
jurisdiction, as we have the oversight 
of the National Park Service. But it is 
not the National Park Service that de-
termines what or who is eligible for in-
scription on the wall. It is the Depart-
ment of Defense that is responsible for 
determining whether members’ names 
are eligible for inscription. This is 
based on very specific criteria that is 
set not by those of us here in Congress, 
not by those of us on the Energy Com-
mittee; it is set specifically by the De-
partment of Defense. 
As has been raised here on the floor, 
the criteria do not allow or accommo-
date the timing. The Evans sailors do 
not meet the eligibility criteria the 
DOD has set out because it was not in 
the defined combat zone of Vietnam at 
the time of the 1969 mishap. 
I agree with my colleagues that it is 
indeed unfortunate that we have this 
designation, this eligibility criteria 
that has left the honor that is due 
these sailors open and unaddressed. It 
is unfortunate that we are here today 
and that I stand left in a position to 
object despite the efforts that my staff 
on the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee and I have made to work 
with Senator CRAMER, work with his 
team, work with DOD to find an ap-
proach that we should all be able to 
agree on to memorialize these sailors. 
As we are looking for that path, I do 
stand to object to discharging this bill 
from the committee, but I will make 
this commitment: This is a matter 
that must be addressed. It is long over-
due. We will find a way to honor these 
sailors. But at this juncture, there re-
main practical, legal, and technical 
considerations we have to resolve with 
the text with regard to the effort that 
my colleague from North Dakota is of-
fering today. At this time, I would like 
to note my objection. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, if I 
might address a couple of things, first 
of all, we are here to change legal ob-
jections. That is why we are the legis-
lative branch. We are the policymaking 
branch. The Department of Defense, 
with as much respect as I have for 
them and particularly for the Sec-
retary—they work for us. We don’t 
work for them. 
I appreciate the commitment of the 
chairman. I look forward to working 
with her and the committee on getting 
to a markup and passing the legisla-
tion so that we don’t have to submit 
ourselves to the bureaucracy but, rath-
er, can get things turned around to 
where the bureaucracy submits itself 
to the legislative branch. 
I thank the President, and I thank 
my colleagues from New York and New 
Hampshire and certainly the chair-
woman of the Energy Committee and 
look forward to working on a resolu-
tion soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to begin the 
vote immediately. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendments were ordered to be 
engrossed and the bill to be read a 
third time. 
The bill was read the third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill pass? 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from Tennessee (Mr. ALEXANDER), the 
Senator from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY), 
and the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. 
SASSE). 
Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator from Tennessee (Mr. ALEX-
ANDER) would have voted ‘‘yea’’ and the 
Senator from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY) 
would have voted ‘‘yea.’’ 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from Vermont (Mr. SANDERS) 
is necessarily absent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there 
any other Senators in the Chamber de-
siring to vote?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2442 
May 14, 2020 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to urge the 
Senate to immediately take action to 
address the issue of elections and spe-
cifically to address technical changes 
to the $400 million in election security 
funding passed in the CARES Act and 
to talk about the coronavirus threat to 
our democracy itself. 
Sixteen States have already post-
poned their Presidential primaries or 
transitioned their primaries to almost 
entirely voting by mail. We have seen 
Republican and Democratic Governors 
across the country, from States like 
West Virginia, Indiana—the Presiding 
Officer’s State—New York, and Ken-
tucky, issue waivers allowing all voters 
to cast their ballots by mail during the 
pandemic. This includes States that 
used to have requirements that you 
have to give a reason to even get a 
mail-in ballot to vote from home. Both 
Democratic and Republican Governors 
have waived it—not in every State but 
in a number of States. 
While it is important that individual 
States are taking action to protect 
voters during this pandemic, it is the 
responsibility of us, of Congress, to en-
sure that States have the funds they 
need to make our elections more resil-
ient and to make sure voters don’t 
have to risk their health to cast their 
ballots. We must do this because, as we 
have seen over the last several weeks, 
not all States are doing everything 
they can to protect voters. That is sad, 
but it is true. 
What is coming before us in the fall 
is a national election. Just yesterday, 
we learned that the attorney general of 
Texas has asked the Texas Supreme 
Court to stop county election officials 
from letting voters who are afraid of 
getting the coronavirus to vote by 
mail. He basically went to court and 
said that the counties that are giving 
out these ballots should stop. He tried, 
he tried, and he is continuing to try to 
stop them from simply sending out bal-
lots to voters who are afraid to vote in 
person. Some of them have preexisting 
conditions. Some of them are veterans 
who served our country. Some of them 
are seniors. 
Basically, in this one State—by the 
way, there are other things going on in 
other States—the attorney general is 
trying to stop them from actually vot-
ing from home. Under Texas law, you 
have to have an excuse in order to vote 
by mail. 
This pandemic, as we know, has 
killed more than 85,000 Americans. 
Local officials in Texas have told the 
voters that the coronavirus—they have 
looked at the law and said that it is a 
valid excuse to request a mail-in bal-
lot. I guess it is. I would think it is. 
But the Texas attorney general dis-
agrees and has asked the Texas Su-
preme Court to stop these local elec-
tion officials from sending voters a 
mail-in ballot. 
That is a disgrace. We shouldn’t be 
playing politics with people’s lives. 
Even the most cynical Americans be-
lieve that. They know people play poli-
tics all the time, but they don’t think 
you should play it with their lives. 
We know from what happened in Wis-
consin that people who show up to vote 
during this crisis are, in fact, risking 
their health if precautions are not 
taken. A little over a month ago, both 
Democratic and Republican voters and 
Independent voters in Wisconsin stood 
for hours in the cold and the rain, 
wearing garbage bags and homemade 
masks, in order to cast their votes. 
There were just 5 polling locations 
open in Milwaukee instead of the usual 
180 and 2 in Green Bay instead of the 
usual 30, and two-thirds of Wisconsin’s 
African-American voters live in Mil-
waukee. 
There is no question that this vast 
reduction in polling places, without 
there being the adequate time to tran-
sition to mail-in voting, ended up 
disenfranchising voters, particularly in 
the case of African-American voters. 
At the same time, we saw people trying 
to vote in whatever way they could. 
They tried to mail in their ballots even 
when it was at the last minute. 
Now health officials say that more 
than 67 people in Wisconsin may have 
become infected with the coronavirus 
as a result of that election. This is un-
acceptable. No one should have to 
choose between exercising the right to 
vote and protecting the health of them-
selves and their loved ones. What hap-
pened in Wisconsin will be forever 
etched in the memory of our Nation. 
We can’t allow this to happen again. 
In the face of this, yesterday, the 
Wisconsin 
Supreme 
Court 
actually 
struck down the Governor’s stay-at- 
home order. 
We should actually be taking steps 
forward now instead of backward. Pub-
lic health experts have warned of the 
possibility of another, more serious 
outbreak of this virus in the fall. Con-
gress must act now to give States the 
funding they need. We know the States 
are strapped—that every single State 
in this country is strapped. 
Even if we were to do nothing here, 
we would know there are going to be 
States 
that 
are 
going 
to 
get 
humongous requests for mail-in ballots 
that they have never gotten before. We 
know that in the State of Wisconsin, 
Senator JOHNSON’s State. It is tradi-
tionally a State in which about 6 per-
cent of the people vote by mail. Next- 
door, in my home State of Minnesota, 
it is 25 percent. Yes, it is more, but we 
know it is probably going to at least 
double—and more—no matter what 
party you are in. 
This is why the Republican Gov-
ernors are asking for money. They may 
not agree with everything in my bill, 
but so many of them are asking for 
funding to be able to help them send 
out those ballots and send out the post-
age so as to keep their polling places 
open, say, for 1 week, 2 weeks, or, we 
think, 20 days in advance so that peo-
ple could actually vote and not con-
gregate in one location. That is why 
this is happening right now. 
Nearly 2 months ago, I introduced 
legislation, the Natural Disaster and 
Emergency Ballot Act, with Senator 
WYDEN, along with 35 of my colleagues. 
The bill would simply ensure that 
every voter could cast a ballot by mail, 
that those who need it could have ex-
panded access to early in-person vot-
ing, and that States could have the 
funding and resources that are nec-
essary to safely administer elections. 
This week, the House introduced the 
COVID 4 bill, the fourth COVID relief 
package, the HEROES Act. It contains 
the election reforms found in my legis-
lation as well as $3.6 billion to help 
States 
protect 
our 
elections 
from 
COVID–19. That is because mailing 
mail-in ballots all over the country is 
going to cost some change. We know 
that. Yet what is the alternative? Is it 
telling veterans who served on the bat-
tlefield in World War II, like the one I 
heard about yesterday, that they can’t 
vote or that they have to stand in line? 
What is the alternative—telling seniors 
they have to stand in line? No, that is 
not a good alternative. The alternative 
is to make sure we expand mail-in bal-
lots. 
I know negotiations will occur over 
the coming days regarding the next re-
lief package. I look forward to working 
with my Democratic and Republican 
colleagues. 
I see the chairman of the Committee 
on Rules and Administration is here, 
Senator BLUNT. I look forward to work-
ing with him just as we have recently 
done on remote committee hearings, 
which have actually, by all accounts, 
gone pretty well in the Senate over the 
last few weeks. 
I am here today to push for a change 
that we know needs to be done, and 
that is to make some changes to make 
sure the first grouping of money we 
got—the $400 million of emergency 
funding in the first bill—can get out to 
the States, because of some changes 
that were made to the original pro-
posal that have made it hard for some 
of our States to be able to get that 
money out. There is a matching re-
quirement, and we see it already play-
ing out. Utah and Oklahoma have indi-
cated they will only be able to access a 
portion of the funding they have been 
provided because they can’t come up 
with the full matching requirement. 
Florida has not yet accessed the funds 
at all because it is working to see if its 
legislature 
can 
accommodate 
the 
matched funding. 
These are all things we have to work 
on for this forthcoming legislation, as 
well as to look at what we did in the 
first package. There are also issues 
with the reporting requirements in the 
bill, but the last thing we want to do is 
to put an undue burden on the States. 
What I really want to focus on now, 
at the end of my remarks, is the need 
to pass the legislation in front of us— 
and I know it will be negotiated—to 
make sure that we fund and help our

States fund our elections. Let’s dispel 
the notion that voting at home is 
somehow a partisan issue. One of the 
States with the highest number of 
mail-in ballots is the State of Utah. It 
is not exactly a bright-blue State. An-
other State that has a very high num-
ber of people voting from home is the 
State of Colorado. This is a State that 
tends to be a purple State. Then we 
have blue States, like Oregon and 
Washington. Then we have a State like 
Arizona that, again, has a high number 
of people voting by mail. On the other 
end are States that don’t have as many 
people voting by mail, but we have a 
mixture of States too. New York is at 
like 5 percent right now. Then we have 
a number of States, like Alabama, that 
don’t have a lot of people voting by 
mail. 
We don’t think—at least I don’t 
think—that every single person is 
going to vote by mail in the election 
this November. The key is to give them 
options and to be able to work with our 
States so that, if we do provide fund-
ing—and I am so hopeful that we will 
be able to come to some kind of agree-
ment here—they can use that money to 
expand their votes by mail, because we 
know their citizens are going to re-
quest it, and also to make sure voting 
on election day will be safe. There are 
ways to do that by encouraging more 
people, if they don’t want to vote by 
mail, to vote early so fewer people will 
be there on the same day. 
What do we see when we look at this? 
A recent poll shows that in some of the 
key States across the country, both 
Republican and Democratic voters—70 
to 80 percent of them—want to be able 
to vote by mail. We have Governors in 
States like New Hampshire—Repub-
lican Governors—in Maryland, and in 
Ohio who want to vote by mail. That is 
the way they want to go. We have a 
secretary of state who is a Republican 
in the State of Washington who wants 
to vote by mail. Her entire State basi-
cally votes by mail right now, and they 
are good people who can talk about 
why this is working for them and how 
we can make it work but only if they 
have the funds. We are not going to be 
able to give them the funds in, say, Oc-
tober and then be able to make sure 
this has happened. 
In conclusion, 17 States still have 
Presidential primaries, and numerous 
others have primaries for other Federal 
offices, and, of course, we have the gen-
eral election on November 3, which is 
less than 6 months away. We cannot let 
more Americans experience what we 
have just seen happen in Wisconsin 
with the garbage bags, with the home-
made masks, with the people getting 
off work at the hospitals and standing 
in line. Nobody should have to choose 
between one’s health and one’s right to 
vote. 
I am committed to securing addi-
tional funding in the upcoming relief 
package, but we have fixes that we 
must make to the original funding that 
we made in the first bill, in the first 
piece of legislation, and we need to get 
that money out to our election officials 
today. 
For these reasons, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of a bill at 
the desk to modify the provisions on 
funding for election security grants. I 
further ask that the bill be considered 
read three times and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, there are 
many things that the Senator from 
Minnesota spoke to that I think most 
of us would agree with. 
This COVID crisis has created all 
kinds of issues that need to be thor-
oughly discussed and thoroughly de-
bated. I think there are a number of us 
on this side of the aisle—I am just one 
standing up—who object to this unani-
mous consent request. The good news 
for the Senator from Minnesota is, in 
talking with those colleagues, they 
also agree there is a fair number of ele-
ments in this bill with which they 
could probably find agreement. 
I rise to certainly extend my hand in 
cooperation with the Senator from 
Minnesota. Let’s work on these things 
together, although this is not a bill 
that comes through my committee’s 
jurisdiction. I can say, in my com-
mittee, we work across the aisle. Staff 
does an awful lot of work, and we come 
to a conclusion. If it is not ready for a 
particular markup, we go back and get 
the work done. We frequently pass a 
piece of legislation by voice vote and 
then bring it to the floor when it has 
all been ironed out. There is no dis-
agreement, and there is no objection, 
and we pass those bills by unanimous 
consent. 
I think the problem here is that this 
bill has never had any kind of com-
mittee markup or any committee work 
whatsoever. So I would just suggest 
that the Senator from Minnesota work 
with her committee and her committee 
chair. I see the committee chair is here 
in the Chamber. Work on this. Try to 
find those areas of agreement. Then 
maybe we could pass this and maybe 
potentially pass this by unanimous 
consent. This piece of legislation is not 
ready. It hasn’t gone through that 
process. As a result, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
appreciate my colleague’s words in 
that he is willing to work with me on 
this bill. 
We know we need the immediate 
fixes to the first piece of legislation, 
but we also need to look forward to 
what we have in front of us. That is to 
make sure that we help our States to 
be able to conduct their elections in a 
safe way so that Democrats, Repub-
licans, and Independents—anyone who 
wants to vote, whatever party one is 
in—is able to safely vote. 
Let’s remember that, while people 
were lining those streets to vote in 
Wisconsin, the President of the United 
States was able to request a mail-in 
ballot from Palm Beach, FL, and vote 
in the comfort of 1600 Pennsylvania Av-
enue. 
That 
is 
an 
image—a 
split 
screen—that I don’t think anyone 
wants to see. I think what we want to 
see is fairness for all Americans. You 
do that by getting them the funding 
ahead of time, by making sure we have 
rules in place that work for everyone, 
by acknowledging this has never been 
nor should it be a partisan issue, and 
by telling all Americans that we have 
worked this out, that we are getting 
the funding to the States, that we are 
working with all of their States, and 
that we have put in some fair rules so 
that no American will be denied the 
right to vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this is 
National Police Week. It is one of the 
weeks that I always look forward to. 
For years now, it has been an oppor-
tunity to spend time with people who 
protect us—who protect all of us. We 
get a chance each day to say thank you 
to the Capitol Police, who work here at 
the Capitol. As the chairman of the 
Law Enforcement Caucus, I have lots 
of opportunities in our State to see of-
ficers in groups and one at a time, and 
I always try to be thankful to them 
when I see them. Yet this is a time 
every year when we get a chance to see 
people from all over the country come 
to Washington, and it is a chance for us 
to say thank you to them and thank 
you to their families. 
This year in particular, Chief Jon 
Belmar—the 
just 
recently 
retiring 
chief at the St. Louis County Police 
Department and good friend who was 
always 
there 
for 
advice, 
always 
brought a big contingent of officers to 
Police Week. So I am thinking about 
him and of not seeing him at Police 
Week in Washington. 
I am also thinking about the new 
chief of the St. Louis County Police 
Department, Chief Mary Barton. This 
is a county of over a million people, so 
it is a substantial job. It is a place to 
really affect how police work is done. I 
look forward to spending time with 
Chief Barton as she moves forward 
with what she can do to build on what 
has happened in the department over 
the years. 
Like so much else this year, Police 
Week is different than it has been be-
fore. There are no sounds of hundreds 
of motorcycles going down the streets 
of Washington as we celebrate the 
week. There are no groups of law en-
forcement officers or police vehicles 
from all over the country coming here. 
I am grateful for them. They protect

our safety. This is a job wherein, every 
day when you leave home, you have no 
idea what events may come before you 
that day, and, frankly, your family has 
no idea what may happen that day. 
I have told a number of officers, in 
thinking about their families, includ-
ing the officers who serve here at the 
Capitol, that they generally have some 
sense as to whether they are in a mo-
ment that could lead to danger or not 
beyond the normal readiness to serve 
us but that their families, with their 
not being with them when they are at 
work, have to wonder over and over 
again during the day what threat may 
come to the person about whom they 
care so much as that person protects 
others. 
Each year, one of the memorable 
events of National Police Week is the 
candlelight vigil that is held at the 
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial a 
few blocks from here. We gather there 
annually to hear the names of officers 
who have lost their lives and to bear 
witness to and be grateful for their 
service. 
Sadly, in the past year, Missouri has 
lost three dedicated officers. 
Last June, Lakeshire Chief of Police 
Wayne Neidenberg passed away after 
assisting at the scene of a rollover 
crash 
in 
O’Fallon, 
MO. 
Chief 
Neidenberg had stopped at the scene on 
his way home, called for assistance, 
and proceeded on after the situation 
was stabilized, but before he got out of 
his car at home, he had a heart attack. 
We lost Chief Neidenberg at that mo-
ment. 
He spent his entire career in law en-
forcement. He served in both the St. 
Louis County Police Department and 
in the Lakeshire Police Department. 
He was an Army veteran. He is sur-
vived by Ardell, his wife; Cori, his 
daughter; and his three sons, Matthew, 
Darek, and Aaron. 
On Sunday, June 23, North County 
Police 
Cooperative 
Officer 
Michael 
Langsdorf responded to a complaint of 
check fraud at a local business in 
Wellston, MO. The man who has been 
charged with his murder shot Officer 
Langsdorf after a struggle inside the 
store. He had served with the depart-
ment for only 3 months, but before 
that, for 17 years, he had been part of 
the St. Louis City Metropolitan Police 
force. 
At his memorial service, Officer 
Langsdorf’s son, Kaleb, remembered his 
dad this way: 
They say never to meet your heroes be-
cause you’ll end up disappointed. Well, I had 
the chance to be raised by mine, and he 
never disappointed. He taught me that a life 
of rescuing, defending and serving is the only 
life worth living. 
In 
addition 
to 
Kaleb, 
Officer 
Langsdorf is survived by Kim, his 
fiancee; by Olivia, his daughter; and by 
his future stepchildren, Devin and 
Kaitlyn. 
Officer Christopher Walsh joined the 
Springfield Police Department in 2016. 
On the evening of Sunday, March 15 of 
this year, Officer Walsh responded to 
an active shooter situation at a con-
venience store. The shooter had opened 
fire in the store, killing three people 
and injuring a fourth person. Officer 
Walsh rushed into harm’s way to pro-
tect others. The shooter opened fire on 
Officer Walsh and killed him. His fel-
low officer, Josiah Overton, was in-
jured in the same attack. Officer Walsh 
was fatally wounded and died the next 
day. 
He was a U.S. Army Reservist. Dur-
ing his 14 years of service in the Re-
serves, he completed tours in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Sheri, his wife, and Mor-
gan, their daughter, will live with his 
loss for the rest of their lives. 
Let me share a passage from Chris’s 
obituary. Chris, by the way, was the 
first Springfield officer of the town I 
live in to be killed on duty since the 
1930s. It is a great city with the great, 
good fortune of its officers’ managing 
to do their jobs without having a loss 
like this, but we had one this year. 
The quote from his obituary reads: 
Christopher Ryan Walsh, a man devoid of 
vanity and devoted to the service and to the 
welfare of others, would hope that out of 
these tragic circumstances something beau-
tiful could take root in all of our hearts. 
Chris would hope that his memory would 
serve as an example to spur small kindnesses 
and acts of devotion and service to all of our 
community, friends and loved ones, to look 
past the things that separate us and to focus 
on the things that unite us. 
So Police Week is exactly the time to 
think about the things that unite us, 
to think about these officers and their 
courage, to think about their acts of 
devotion and service as we remember 
them. 
Congress wants to make sure that 
law enforcement officers have the sup-
port they need and never get into a sit-
uation without the resources needed to 
back them up. I am honored to serve as 
cochairman of the bipartisan Senate 
Law Enforcement Caucus, which ad-
vances legislation that supports the ef-
forts of law enforcement nationwide. 
Senator COONS from Delaware is the 
other founder and cochair. 
Together, we sponsored the National 
Law Enforcement Museum Commemo-
rative Coin Act that became law last 
year. The proceeds of the sales from 
those coins minted under the law 
would go to education and outreach 
about the service and sacrifice of law 
enforcement officers throughout our 
country’s history. 
I am also a cosponsor of legislation 
that would provide resources to protect 
officers’ mental and physical well- 
being, including the Law Enforcement 
Suicide Data Collection Act and the 
Lifesaving Gear for Police Act. I am 
glad to be a cosponsor of the Thin Blue 
Line Act and the Back the Blue Act, 
both of which are designed to better 
protect police officers and hold per-
petrators who attack them account-
able. Through these pieces of legisla-
tion and several others, the Congress 
has a chance to once again show its 
support of the men and women who 
serve in law enforcement. 
Police Week is different this year. I 
think we are all particularly appre-
ciative of how law enforcement is hav-
ing to step up in the crisis of the virus, 
doing what needs to be done, and again 
often making way for first responders 
and others to do what they can to save 
life and to protect other people who 
somehow are on the edges of this virus. 
They deal with people who are isolated 
in their homes, and because they are 
isolated, their mental health issues 
have become bigger issues. This is not 
an easy time for any of those who 
serve. 
Every year, we remember law en-
forcement, but this year I think we 
need to be particularly grateful for 
those who serve and protect us. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO THE KENTUCKY 
DERBY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as 
spring begins to give way to summer, 
there is a singular tradition that 
unites everyone from across my home 
State. Even after particularly conten-
tious college basketball seasons, Ken-
tuckians of all backgrounds can look 
with pride to the Twin Spires of 
Churchill Downs for the Kentucky 
Derby. Since 1875, the pride of Louis-
ville has been inextricably linked to 
the ‘‘Most Exciting Two Minutes in 
Sports.’’ 
This year, however, fans couldn’t 
gather at the Grandstands, the infield, 
or at a Derby Party. The coronavirus 
pandemic has changed the daily lives 
of nearly every American. Even our 
most sacred traditions have been put 
on hold as we follow the advice of med-
ical experts to slow the spread of this 
terrible virus. As a result, the Ken-
tucky Derby has been postponed for 
the first time since the Second World 
War. The 146th Run for the Roses will 
instead take place over Labor Day 
weekend in September. 
Jerry Brewer, a Kentucky native and 
Washington Post sports writer, put 
into words the sense of longing felt by 
so many Kentuckians. In a wonderful 
column published on what would have

been Derby weekend, Jerry shared both 
his personal reflections and our shared 
emotions. In Louisville, the Derby is 
more than a single race. Kentuckians 
spend the weeks before celebrating our 
people and our heritage. I am grateful 
that someone with such eloquence 
could describe Kentucky’s Derby pas-
sion. 
That is not to say horseracing fans 
weren’t treated to a race on May 2. In-
stead of hosting the world’s most an-
ticipated horse race, Churchill Downs 
created a virtual running of Triple 
Crown winners. In a match of some of 
horseracing’s biggest names, Secre-
tariat—one of the greatest horses to 
ever run—completed an all-star vic-
tory. 
Although a lot will be different about 
the Labor Day Derby, so much of what 
makes the Kentucky Derby special will 
remain the same. Whether at the track 
or watching from home, fans will still 
get to sip a mint julep filled with Ken-
tucky’s 
signature 
spirit. 
Longtime 
residents and first-time visitors alike 
will feel the sentimental tug as they 
sing ‘‘My Old Kentucky Home.’’ And 
the 
thundering 
hooves 
of 
thoroughbreds will echo in the ears of 
millions. 
The postponement is certainly a dis-
appointment, but I would encourage 
my fellow Kentuckians not to despair. 
Our traditions are rooted deeply in the 
Bluegrass. We will beat this virus, and 
Kentucky will get the chance to shine 
once again. Like the champions whose 
names surround Churchill Downs, Ken-
tucky has the strength and grit to 
overcome any obstacle and cross the 
finish line. 
We may not have a 146th Kentucky 
Derby 
champion 
for 
a 
few 
more 
months, but I think Jerry Brewer 
would agree, it is worth the wait. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Jerry Brewer’s article be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, May 1, 2020] 
ON DERBY-LESS WEEKEND, MISSING MY 
KENTUCKY HOME 
(By Jerry Brewer) 
A Kentuckian’s most humbling Kentucky 
Derby story: About 15 years ago, I hosted 
Washington Post colleague Rick Maese, then 
with the Baltimore Sun, for his first Run for 
the Roses. Picked him up from the airport. 
Bought us tickets to a concert that week 
featuring Common and the Roots. Probably 
had a mint julep and slice of Derby pie wait-
ing in the cupholder. I was thrilled to show 
him Louisville at its proudest time. 
On the drive to my apartment, Rick looked 
out the window and saw a man who was 
walking clumsily, perhaps drunkenly, while 
pulling a dog that was missing a leg. The 
scene was cruel, heartbreaking, ridiculous. It 
was Rick’s first impression of my state. 
And that’s usually how we are: Mostly 
rural, largely odd and shockingly com-
plicated. Our long-standing problems with 
big issues such as race and education are 
well documented. We’re weird. We see blue in 
grass. We love basketball more than we love 
people. We are known for keeping it real 
hick, and as much as we despise that stereo-
type, part of us plays along because it helps 
the beauty of Kentucky remain a secret, 
never to be swarmed and overtaken by care-
less outsiders. 
But during Derby week, that mentality 
shifts. We want to shine. Louisville—the 
only city in the state that feels like a big 
city (when it actually claims its relationship 
to Kentucky)—becomes the most gracious 
host that any sporting event has ever had. 
Don’t challenge me on that; I can wield a 
mean pitchfork. When it comes to tailoring 
every inch of an area to ensure an unforget-
table experience for all visitors, Louisville 
rolls out a red carpet and throws rose petals 
at your feet. 
Rick shook off that weird introduction and 
loved his first Derby experience. He has been 
back several times. When I started dating 
my wife seriously, I took her to the Derby; 
meeting the entire family was a mere after-
thought. As a Paducah native who lived in 
Louisville for several years, there is no 
greater personal holiday than the first Sat-
urday 
in 
May. 
And 
so, 
as 
the 
novel 
coronavirus pandemic keeps us in isolation, 
there is no stronger sense of loss for me than 
what I’m experiencing right now. 
I have attended 11 Derbies. I have partied 
during the Derby for just about all 42 of my 
years. My childhood memories are full of 
gatherings at my grandparents’ house in east 
Louisville, where the scent of mint was more 
welcome than pine at Christmastime. My 
adult memories are even better, from trying 
to cover the event as poetically as the 
sportswriting legends I grew up reading to, 
well, acting a fool in the infield during my 
college days. 
Even in Kentucky, with its beautiful roll-
ing hills and horse farms, this is a niche 
sport. Everyone is a Kentucky Derby fan, 
though. Our connection to this event is a 
very powerful and emotional thing. 
Derby week is so grand, and we delight in 
sharing all of the festivities with the world 
while fighting to keep the Kentucky Oaks— 
the illustrious Grade I stakes race for 3– 
year-old fillies held the day before the 
Derby—a more local event. But over the past 
20 years, even the Oaks crowd has surpassed 
100,000 with regularity. 
Still, the fancy affair turns intimate when 
‘‘My Old Kentucky Home’’ plays before the 
Derby. We wait all year just to feel alive and 
relevant in that moment. Soon after, the 
most anticipated two minutes in sports con-
clude, and before you know it, the time to 
clean up and plan anew has arrived. 
I like the fleeting nature of this joy. The 
Derby is our cherry blossom. Wait, wait, 
wait, revel. Go back to waiting. It’s deflating 
to know the wait will be much longer this 
time. 
The 146th Kentucky Derby has been re-
scheduled for Sept. 5. Churchill Downs an-
nounced Thursday that its spring meet will 
open May 16. Fans won’t be able to attend, 
but the plan is to start racing again. There’s 
something even emptier about the thought 
of horses competing in a bubble than human 
athletes. 
And who knows if even that is safe enough? 
Everything about the resumption of nor-
malcy comes back to this: We are at the 
mercy of a virus that we are still trying to 
understand. So the odds of this Derby really 
being the Derby in September—with 150,000 
fans flaunting their style, understanding of 
color and taste in hats—seem long. If it hap-
pens, it may play decently on television, but 
it won’t be the same. 
To me, the Kentucky Derby is a home-
coming with a paisley bow tie wrapped 
around it. We get the floor, and we make it 
the most majestic floor you have ever seen. 
Home can be cringeworthy, but it’s also 
swanky and magnificent. We clean up good 
for y’all, but mostly we clean up good for us.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent to have printed in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD Senator ALEX-
ANDER’s opening statement that he de-
livered yesterday at the Senate Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor 
and Pensions. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
COVID–19: SAFELY GETTING BACK TO WORK 
AND BACK TO SCHOOL 
Mr. Alexander. The Committee on HELP 
will please come to order. First, some admin-
istrative matters based on the advice of the 
Attending Physician and the Sergeant at 
Arms after consulting with the Department 
of Health and Human Services and the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Individuals in the hearing room are seated 
6 feet apart. As a result, there is no room for 
the public to attend in person. Representa-
tives of the press are working as a pool to 
relay their observations to colleagues. The 
hearing may be watched live on-line. An un-
edited recording will be available on the 
Committee’s website—www.help.senate.gov. 
Witnesses 
are 
participating 
by 
video-
conference in a one-time exception. Some 
senators, including the chairman, are par-
ticipating by videoconference. Senators may 
remove their masks to talk into the micro-
phone since they are all six feet apart. I am 
grateful to the Rules Committee, Sergeant 
at Arms, the press gallery, the Architect of 
the Capitol, the Capitol Police, and our com-
mittee staff, Chung Shek and Evan Griffis, 
for all of their hard work to help keep all of 
us safe. 
At our hearing last Thursday, I said that 
all roads back to work and back to school 
lead through testing and that what our coun-
try has done so far on testing so far is ‘‘im-
pressive but not nearly enough.’’ Over the 
weekend, Sen. Schumer, the Democrat lead-
er, was nice enough to put out a tweet 
quoting half of what I said. He left out the 
other half, the ‘‘impressive’’ part. So let me 
say it again in more specific terms. 
When I said ‘‘impressive,’’ I meant that, 
according to Johns Hopkins University, the 
United States has tested over 9 million 
Americans for COVID–19. That is twice as 
many as any other country—we don’t know 
what China has done—and more per capita 
than most countries including South Korea, 
which several committee members have 
cited as an example of a country doing test-
ing well. 
According to Dr. Deborah Birx, the U.S. 
will double its testing during the month of 
May and be able to do at least 10 million 
tests per month. Here is what ‘‘impressive’’ 
means in Tennessee: First, anyone who is 
sick, or a first responder or a health care 
worker can get tested. Next, Governor Bill 
Lee is also testing every prisoner, every resi-
dent and staff member of a nursing home, of-
fered weekend drive-thru testing, and has 
done specific outreach to increase testing in 
low income neighborhoods. A Tennessean 
can get a free test and a free mask at the 
local public health clinic. The governor’s slo-
gan is: ‘‘If in doubt, get a test.’’ 
Gov. Lee sent his testing goals for May to 
the federal government, as every state has 
done. The federal government will help make 
sure the state has the supplies it needs if the 
labs and hospitals in our state have trouble 
getting them through the usual commercial

channels. Tennessee has tested 4 percent of 
its population. The governor hopes to in-
crease that to 7 percent by the end of May. 
That impressive level of testing is sufficient 
to begin phase I of going back to work in 
Tennessee, but as I said last week, it is not 
nearly enough to provide confidence to 31,000 
students and faculty that it is safe to return 
to the University of Tennessee Knoxville 
campus in August. 
Last week I talked with UT Knoxville 
Chancellor Donde Plowman about what 
might persuade UT students and 20 million 
other college students or parents of 50 mil-
lion k–12 students that it is safe to leave 
their homes and return to 5,000 college cam-
puses and 100,000 public schools in August. 
That is where the new shark tank, or RAD X, 
at the National Institutes of Health that we 
heard about at our hearing last Thursday 
comes in. Swimming around in that shark 
tank are dozens of early stage proposals for 
new ways to create diagnostic tests. 
Three weeks ago, Congress gave NIH $1.5 
billion to create a competitive environment 
in which Dr. Francis Collins, the distin-
guished scientist who directs NIH, can 
search for a few new ideas that can create 
millions more tests by August and even mil-
lions more by the Fall flu season. Congress 
gave BARDA another $1 billion to coordinate 
the manufacture and scaling up rapidly sim-
ple tests with quick results. 
For example, the FDA authorized last 
week its first diagnostic test using saliva a 
person provides at home instead of a nose 
swab or blood. It authorized its first antigen 
test, like the ones used for flu or strep 
throat, which involves swabbing the inside of 
a nose to produce a result in a few minutes. 
Another proposal, not yet approved, is to 
put in your mouth a sort of lollipop that is 
a sponge, take a photograph of the lollipop 
with your cell phone and transmit it to a 
laboratory. If it lights up, you will know you 
test positive. 
Or the university might send students’ sa-
liva to a gene sequencing laboratory, which 
can process thousands of these in one night 
and report to the university the next day. In 
all of these cases, if anyone tests positive, 
that student or faculty member will be asked 
to self-isolate for two weeks, and the rest of 
the student body can continue their edu-
cation. The same screening test might be re-
peated in two or four weeks. That same proc-
ess could occur at a middle school or factory 
or in advance of/for players in a sporting 
event. 
Of course, anyone testing negative one day 
could test positive the next. But such wide-
spread screening of entire campuses, schools 
or places of work would help to identify 
those who are sick and to track down and 
quarantine those who are exposed. That in 
turn, should help to persuade parents and 
students that it is safe to leave home and go 
back to school. 
In addition to more testing by August, I 
expect Dr. Fauci to tell us about additional 
treatments available to reduce the risk of 
death from COVID–19 and about the adminis-
tration’s plan to do something never done 
before by this country—start mass manufac-
turing a vaccine before you know for sure 
that it works. 
Vaccines and treatments are the ultimate 
solutions. But until we have them, all roads 
back to work and back to school go through 
testing. The more tests we conduct, the bet-
ter we can identify the small number of 
those who are sick and track those who they 
have had contact with. Then we can quar-
antine the sick and exposed instead of trying 
to quarantine the entire country with disas-
trous effects on our economic wellbeing. This 
will require millions more new tests, many 
of them new technologies. Some of these will 
fail. But we only need a few successes to cre-
ate millions more tests. 
That is why I said last Thursday that what 
our country has done so far in testing is im-
pressive, but not nearly enough. First, 
squeeze all the extra tests out of current 
technologies. But then create new tech-
nologies to produce millions more tests to 
identify and isolate those who are sick and 
persuade the rest of us it is safe to go back 
to work and back to school. 
This is a bipartisan oversight hearing to 
examine how well we are preparing the coun-
try to go safely back to work and to school 
and to determine what more we need to do. 
Such an exercise sometimes encourages fin-
ger pointing. Who did what wrong? Before we 
spend too much time finger pointing, I would 
like to suggest that almost all of us—the 
United States and every country—underesti-
mated this virus. Underestimated how con-
tagious it would be. How it can travel si-
lently without causing symptoms. How it 
can be especially deadly among certain seg-
ments of the population, including the elder-
ly, those with pre-existing conditions, and 
minority populations. 
At the committee’s March 3 hearing on 
coronavirus—six weeks after the first case 
had arrived in this country, when there were 
only 
two 
deaths 
in 
the 
US 
from 
coronavirus—I read this paragraph from the 
front page of the March 1 Sunday New York 
Times: Much about the coronavirus remains 
unclear, and it is far from certain that the 
outbreak will reach severe proportions in the 
United States or affect many regions at 
once. With its top-notch scientists, modern 
hospitals and sprawling public health infra-
structure, most experts agree, the United 
States is among the countries best prepared 
to prevent or manage such an epidemic. 
A lot of effort has gone into trying to 
make the United States among the best pre-
pared nations. Over 20 years, the last four 
Presidents and several Congresses—in re-
sponse to 9/11, bird flu, Katrina, SARS, H1N1, 
MERS, and Ebola—passed 9 significant laws 
that created or contributed to the public 
health preparedness and response framework 
we have today. 
These 9 laws stood up the Strategic Na-
tional Stockpile, created an assistant sec-
retary for preparedness and response, pro-
vided incentives for the development and 
manufacturing of diagnostics, vaccines, and 
medicines, strengthened the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, and created the 
Biomedical Advanced Research and Develop-
ment Authority (BARDA). Thanks to the 
leadership of Sen. Blunt and Sen. Murray, 
Congress increased funding to the National 
Institutes of Health for five straight years. 
All of this was part of a shared goal— 
Democrats and Republicans, Congresses and 
four Presidents—to advance our ability to 
respond to public health threats, whether 
known, like anthrax, or emerging, like 
COVID–19, and they incorporated lessons 
learned from public health emergencies at 
the time. But despite all that effort, even the 
experts underestimated COVID–19. 
This hearing is about how we improve our 
response now and in the fall when this virus 
is expected to return. During our oversight 
hearing today and future hearings, I also in-
tend to focus on the next pandemic: What 
can we learn from this one to be ready for 
the next one, which will surely come? Can we 
learn from the current fast tracking of tests, 
treatments and vaccines how to make them 
available even more rapidly next time? How 
to keep hospitals and states from selling off 
masks and other protective equipment in be-
tween crises because of tight budgets. How 
to make sure Congress funds our share of the 
responsibility? How to provide enough extra 
hospital beds without canceling elective sur-
geries, hurting other patients and bank-
rupting hospitals. Whose job should it be to 
coordinate supply lines so that protective 
equipment, 
supplies, 
and 
medicines 
are 
available and delivered to where they need to 
be, when they are needed? How can the 
stockpile be managed better and what should 
be in it? 
My preacher once said: ‘‘I’m not worried 
about you on Sunday, it’s what you do dur-
ing the rest of the week.’’ I’m afraid that 
during 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
week—between 
pandemics—we relax our focus on prepared-
ness. We become preoccupied with other im-
portant things. Our collective memory is 
short. Just three months ago the country 
was consumed with impeaching a President. 
Now that seems like ancient Roman history. 
Now, while this crisis has our full attention, 
I believe we should put into law this year 
whatever improvements we need to be well 
prepared for the next one. If there is to be 
finger pointing, I hope fingers will point in 
that direction. 
We are fortunate today to have four distin-
guished witnesses who are at the heart of the 
response to the coronavirus crisis. I have 
asked each to summarize his remarks in five 
minutes. Then we will have a five minute 
round of questions. I have agreed that we 
will end our hearing at 12:30, which will per-
mit one full round of questions. Sen. Murray 
will have the opportunity to ask an addi-
tional question before we close and all sen-
ators will be able to submit questions for the 
record. There will be other hearings to follow 
last Thursday’s hearing on testing and this 
one. 
Staying at home indefinitely is not the 
way to end this pandemic. There is not 
enough money available to help all those 
hurt by a closed economy. All roads back to 
work and back to school lead through test-
ing, tracking, isolation, treatment, and vac-
cines. This requires widespread testing— 
millions more tests created mostly by new 
technologies—to identify those who are sick 
and who have been exposed so they can be 
quarantined and, by containing the disease 
in this way, give the rest of America enough 
confidence to leave their homes. For the 
near term, to help make sure those 31,000 UT 
students and faculty show up in August, we 
need widespread testing—millions more tests 
created mostly by new technologies—to iden-
tify those who are sick and who have been 
exposed so they can be quarantined and, by 
containing the disease in this way, give the 
rest of America enough confidence to go 
back to work and back to school.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the bravery and dedica-
tion of our Nation’s law enforcement 
personnel. Even under normal cir-
cumstances, police officers put their 
lives on the line every day to defend 
our communities; now, as our country 
struggles through an unprecedented 
public health crisis, policemen and 
women are taking on even more per-
sonal risk to keep Americans safe. 
They deserve our wholehearted grati-
tude and respect. 
I am proud to cosponsor Senator 
FEINSTEIN and Senator GRAHAM’s reso-
lution designating May 10 through May 
16 as National Police Week and empha-
sizing our support for the law enforce-
ment officers across the United States 
who work to preserve our safety and 
security. The resolution also pays re-
spect to the many police officers who

S2448 
May 14, 2020 
tragically fell in the line of duty in the 
last year, including Officer Kyle David 
Olinger of the Montgomery County, 
MD, Police Department. 
Officer Olinger served with the Mont-
gomery County Police Department for 
2 years and had previously served with 
the Reading Police Department for 6 
years. On April 18, 2019, Officer Olinger 
succumbed to complications of a gun-
shot wound he sustained on August 13, 
2003, while making a traffic stop at the 
intersection of Second Avenue and 
Spring Street in Silver Spring. He ob-
served one of the passengers in vehicle 
attempting to conceal a handgun un-
derneath the seat. He ordered the man 
to drop the weapon before a struggle 
ensued. The man shot Officer Olinger 
in the neck, injuring his spinal column. 
The subject and the three other occu-
pants drove away but were all appre-
hended a short time later. The man 
who shot him was convicted of at-
tempted murder and subsequently sen-
tenced to life in prison. Officer Olinger 
was paralyzed below his chest because 
of the shooting. He was married and 
had two sons. We will not forget his 
courage and the courage of his brothers 
and sisters on the force. 
Police officers around the country 
have devoted their lives to protecting 
us, and we must do everything within 
our power to protect them, too. During 
the COVID–19 pandemic, that means 
ensuring that all law enforcement offi-
cers have the equipment, training, and 
resources they need to stay safe while 
they 
continue 
their 
duties. 
Even 
though there is an extremely con-
tagious and dangerous virus spreading 
all over the U.S., police forces cannot 
simply stop responding to crimes and 
emergencies. Policewomen and men, 
like healthcare providers and other es-
sential workers, face a higher risk of 
contracting the coronavirus so that the 
rest of us can be safe and healthy. As of 
May 11, 2020, 101 officers have died from 
COVID–19. The least we can do is try to 
mitigate the risk that they face and 
save as many law enforcement lives as 
possible. 
There are concrete steps that we can 
and must take to safeguard our Na-
tion’s police officers during this epi-
demic. First and foremost, it is critical 
that we make the required personal 
protective equipment—PPE—and test-
ing universally available to the police. 
I have heard heartwarming stories 
about communities in Maryland donat-
ing PPE to their local police stations, 
but the bottom line is that public citi-
zens should not need to take on that 
responsibility. The government should 
ensure that law enforcement agencies 
have the tools and equipment they 
need to perform their duties safely, es-
pecially during a period of increased 
risk like this one. I hope that we will 
significantly expand funding to State 
and local governments in upcoming 
coronavirus legislation so that they 
have the means to do so. 
Unfortunately, even with added pro-
tective measures, there will still be law 
enforcement 
officers 
who 
contract 
COVID–19 in the line of duty. We owe 
those brave men and women support to 
recover medically and financially from 
this disease. That means that we need 
to make workers compensation and 
comprehensive healthcare, both phys-
ical and mental, fully accessible to po-
lice officers and men whom COVID–19 
has affected. We also need to recognize 
that serving as a police officer is much 
more dangerous now than it was 6 
months ago, and it should be com-
pensated accordingly; law enforcement 
officers deserve hazard pay for putting 
themselves in harm’s way during this 
pandemic in order to keep our commu-
nities safe. 
Of course, we need to work not just 
during National Police Week and not 
just during this health crisis but year- 
round to show law enforcement officers 
our gratitude. We must do everything 
we can to protect them in the line of 
duty and care for them when their 
service causes them harm. I will con-
tinue fighting to support the heroes 
who bravely risk their own security to 
make this country a safer place for all 
of us. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, each day, 
our peace officers prepare for work 
with no guarantee of what the next 
shift holds. They say goodbye to their 
loved ones and head out to serve and 
protect communities throughout Maine 
and across the country. And unfortu-
nately, on some devastating days, they 
don’t come home. These selfless citi-
zens put themselves in dangerous posi-
tions day in and day out to ensure the 
safety of our people it is a commitment 
that evokes awe. They are heroes, 
walking among us, and when they 
make the ultimate sacrifice, it is on us 
to ensure that their names and deeds 
are not forgotten. 
So today, I rise to honor those who 
have made that sacrifice. This week, 
we mark National Police Week. This 
year’s observance is, obviously, a bit 
different than usual. There will be no 
gathering peace officers from all over 
the country come to Washington, DC, 
to honor their fallen brothers and sis-
ters; there will be no in-person candle-
light vigil. But though the events are 
different, the goal is the same: to 
honor the memory of those who have 
given so much to protect our commu-
nities. 
This pandemic will not change our 
dedication to mourn their loss and 
honor their service, and this year, we 
will add 307 names of those who lost 
their lives in the line of duty to the 
National Law Enforcement Officers 
Memorial, including two peace officers 
from my home State of Maine. I want 
to take this opportunity to share a lit-
tle more about the legacies these peace 
officers leave behind. 
First: 
Detective 
Benjamin 
James 
Campbell of the Maine State Police 
died in the line of duty on April 3, 2019. 
Detective Campbell was helping a dis-
abled vehicle in Hampden, ME, when he 
was struck by a vehicle tire. He was 
just 31 years old and leaves behind a 
wife and young son. He served the 
Maine State Police since 2012 and was 
promoted to detective in 2017. 
When asked to describe Detective 
Campbell, Maine State Police Col. 
John Cote put it simply and strongly, 
he said Detective Campbell was ‘‘one of 
our very best.’’ One of our very best— 
that tells you all you need to know 
about how his colleagues felt about 
him—an officer who stopped to help 
someone, a caring man, and a life 
taken much too soon. 
Second, the memorial will include 
the name of Perley Morrison Sprague, 
chief of the Rockport Police Depart-
ment. Sadly, Chief Sprague suffered a 
major cardiac event on November 15, 
1996, and died as a result. A son of 
Maine, Chief Sprague embodied a life of 
service. He was born in Bangor in 1948. 
He was a Coast Guard veteran, serving 
in Vietnam, and held numerous public 
safety positions in Maine, including as 
a member of the Portland Police De-
partment and the Maine Department of 
Marine Resources, where he served for 
21 years and worked his way up to chief 
of the bureau of the marine patrol. In 
1995, he accepted his final position as 
the Rockport chief of police. Once at 
Rockport, he was described as a man 
with new ideas and visions for hiring 
and training. He lived a life of service, 
and Maine will never forget him. 
As we mourn the loss of these heroes, 
we must do our part to lift up the loved 
ones and communities they have left 
behind. May God bless Detective Camp-
bell, Chief Sprague, and the others 
around the country who lost their 
lives. And may God continue to watch 
over those peace officers who go to 
work, with no guarantee they will re-
turn. They are examples for us all, and 
Maine will never forget them.

105TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I 
want to join my friends in the Arme-
nian community in solemnly observing 
the 105th anniversary of the Armenian 
Genocide. While we could not com-
memorate the Armenian Genocide in 
Rhode Island as we normally would due 
to the pandemic, I know we are united 
in our belief in the bright future and 
resilience of the Armenian people. 
More than a century ago, one of the 
worst tragedies of the 20th century 
began when the Young Turk leaders of 
the Ottoman Empire executed more 
than 200 prominent Armenians. What 
followed was an 8-year campaign of 
massacre and oppression. By 1923, an 
estimated one and a half million Arme-
nians were killed and over a half a mil-
lion survivors were exiled. 
These atrocities affected the lives of 
every Armenian living in Asia Minor 
and across the globe. The U.S. Ambas-
sador to the Ottoman Empire during 
this dark time, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., 
unsuccessfully pleaded with President

Wilson to take action and later remem-
bered the events of the Genocide, say-
ing, ‘‘I am confident that the whole 
history of the human race contains no 
such horrible episode as this. The great 
massacres and persecutions of the past 
seem almost insignificant when com-
pared to the sufferings of the Armenian 
race in 1915.’’ 
Those who survived the Armenian 
Genocide, however, persevered due to 
their unbreakable spirit. Survivors of 
the Armenian Genocide contributed 
greatly to the lands in which they es-
tablished new homes and communities, 
including the United States. That is 
why we not only commemorate this 
grave tragedy each year, but also take 
the time to celebrate the traditions 
and the contributions of the Armenian 
people. Indeed, my home State of 
Rhode Island continues to be enriched 
by our strong and vibrant Armenian- 
American community. 
I was pleased when a resolution to 
encourage the U.S. to officially recog-
nize the Armenian Genocide passed the 
Senate in December. We must find a 
way to come together to recognize the 
truth of what happened, and support 
and assist those facing persecution 
today. 
As ranking member on the Senate 
Armed Services Committee and a mem-
ber of the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee, I also remain committed to 
supporting assistance to Armenia to 
strengthen security, promote economic 
growth, and foster democratic reforms 
and development. 
As we remember the past, we remain 
committed to forging a brighter future. 
We must continue to guard against ha-
tred and oppression so that we can pre-
vent such crimes against humanity 
from happening again. 
Thank you.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS AWARENESS 
DAY 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the 
Children’s Tumor Foundation is ob-
serving 
May 
17, 
2020, 
as 
neurofibromatosis—NF—Awareness 
Day to educate the public about this 
rare genetic disorder that impacts 
more than 2 million people around the 
world. It is estimated that 1 in every 
3,000 births is diagnosed with NF; yet it 
is still is relatively unknown to the 
public. 
NF affects all populations equally, 
regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender. 
The disorder causes tumors to grow on 
nerves throughout the body and can 
also affect development of the brain, 
cardiovascular system, bones, and skin. 
Further, the disorder can lead to blind-
ness, deafness, bone abnormalities, dis-
figurement, learning disabilities, dis-
abling pain, and cancer. 
The Children’s Tumor Foundation 
leads efforts to promote and finan-
cially sponsor world-class medical re-
search aimed at finding effective treat-
ments and, ultimately, a cure for NF. 
They do this by actively fostering col-
laborative partnerships in both science 
and industry to speed the drug research 
and development process through a 
number of consortia. 
In kind, the Children’s Tumor Foun-
dation is working around the clock to 
improve 
access 
to 
quality 
patient 
healthcare through its national NF 
clinic network. It provides patient and 
family support through its information 
resources, youth programs, and local 
chapter activities. 
Much remains to be done in raising 
public awareness of NF to help promote 
early diagnosis, proper management 
and treatment, prevention of complica-
tions, and support for research. 
NF affects children all across the 
world; and in recognition of this impor-
tant initiative and the tireless research 
taking place, I support recognizing 
May 17, 2020 as Neurofibromatosis 
Awareness Day.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DARCY SCHINDLER 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Darcy Schindler of Granite County for 
his tremendous efforts to support his 
community 
during 
the 
ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Darcy has been a committed and pas-
sionate science teacher over the past 27 
years. He joined the teaching ranks at 
Drummond High School 20 years ago, 
where he continues to mentor and en-
courage countless students. 
When 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic 
began spreading across the country, 
Darcy was hearing stories from his 
friends working in the medical and 
dental fields, that they were having a 
tough time finding protective masks. 
Darcy decided to take action and 
began volunteering his time and re-
sources to create protective masks for 
our healthcare heroes and first re-
sponders on the frontlines of this ongo-
ing coronavirus pandemic in Montana. 
With the school’s permission, Darcy 
used the school’s 3D printer to produce 
the protective masks. With support 
from those in the community, along 
with his own time and resources, Darcy 
has shipped well over 100 masks across 
Montana. He has not taken any pay-
ments for his shipments. He only asks 
that they instead make a donation to 
the Drummond Schools Science Fund 
to help his students. 
It is my honor to recognize Darcy 
Schindler for his efforts to support our 
healthcare heroes and our first re-
sponders. His selflessness and commit-
ment to serve others is an extraor-
dinary example of how Montanans are 
stepping up in the face of this pan-
demic to help one another. I thank 
Darcy Schindler for his efforts to help 
the Drummond community and com-
munities all across Montana.∑ 
200TH ANNIVERSARY OF OAKLAND 
COUNTY 
∑
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 200th anniver-
sary of my home, Oakland County, MI. 
Established March 28, 1820, and situ-
ated just north of Detroit in south-
eastern Michigan, Oakland County has, 
over the past 200 years, transformed 
from a small rural settlement to a 
thriving economic hub. 
On January 11, 1805, Congress estab-
lished the Michigan Territory, but 
nearly a decade later the area re-
mained largely unsettled due to the 
reputation that it was too wild, even 
for the heartiest of pioneers. The terri-
tory began to modernize and attract 
settlers under the strong leadership of 
Governor Lewis Cass, appointed in 1813 
by President James Madison as a re-
ward for his military service in the 
War of 1812. Avon Township, now Roch-
ester and Rochester Hills, became the 
first area settled in Oakland County 
thanks to a settlers from New England, 
New York, and southern Canada. Gov-
ernor Cass requested the remaining 
territory carefully surveyed, which re-
vealed a bounty of fertile land ripe for 
settlement in the area now known as 
Pontiac. Therefore, on March 28, 1820, 
Cass established Oakland County and 
designated the central city of Pon-
tiac—no more than a day’s journey 
from any point in the county—as coun-
ty seat. In this newly established seat, 
Cass allocated land to erect a court-
house, jail, cemetery, market, school-
house, and several churches. At this 
time, Oakland County had a population 
of 330. 
It is crucial to recognize the inhabi-
tation and development of the land 
prior to the arrival of European set-
tlers. Native Americans from the Chip-
pewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi Tribes, 
collectively known as the Anishinaabe, 
occupied the region for thousands of 
years prior. Early European explorers 
to Michigan recorded the Anishinaabe 
development of the land, noting their 
key paths and roadways. When forming 
the county, settlers continued to use 
and build upon these thoroughfares, 
many of which still exist to this day. 
The 
Shiawassee 
Trail 
is 
now 
Shiawassee 
Street 
in 
Farmington; 
Saginaw Trail is part of Dixie High-
way; and Grand River Trail is now US 
16. 
The 
Anishinaabe 
indisputably 
shaped the current landscape of Oak-
land County and its trade and travel 
routes. 
Today, 200 years since Governor Cass 
established Oakland County, I recog-
nize its transformation from a rural 
community to the home of 62 cities, 
townships, and villages, 11 colleges and 
universities, and a center for industrial 
and technological development. The 
economy employs over 650,000 workers, 
with the largest industries being manu-
facturing, healthcare and social assist-
ance, and professional, scientific, and 
technical services. In addition to its ro-
bust private sector, Oakland County is

the base for over 11,000 nonprofit orga-
nizations. But what truly makes Oak-
land County unique are the parks, mu-
seums, beaches, downtowns, and thea-
ters enjoyed by the diverse population 
of residents from all backgrounds, 
faiths, and identities. 
As a fifth-generation Michigander 
living in Oakland County, I am hon-
ored to ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing the rich history of the re-
gion as well as this significant mile-
stone. I wish Oakland County contin-

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. CARPER (for himself and 
Mr. ALEXANDER): 
S. 3735. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to extend and 
modify the credit for alternative fuel 
vehicle refueling property; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to 
talk about the Securing America’s 
Clean Fuels Infrastructure Act, which I 
am introducing today with my good 
friend, the senior Senator from Ten-
nessee. Our legislation would improve 
and expand the existing Alternative 
Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property In-
vestment Tax Credit, which is com-
monly known as ‘‘30C.’’ 
The Securing America’s Clean Fuels 
Infrastructure Act is about giving 
Americans a real choice when it comes 
to transportation, and it’s about eco-
nomic opportunity at a time when 
Americans need it most. On America’s 
roads and highways today, gas stations 
are rarely farther than the next corner 
or next exit. That’s not necessarily 
true for cleaner fuels. In order to meet 
our clean air and climate goals and 
lead the world in clean vehicle manu-
facturing, Americans must have great-
er access to hydrogen refueling and 
electric charging stations. Our legisla-
tion improves upon current tax credits 
to better incentivize companies to 
make investments today—rather than 
later—in the construction of clean fuel 
vehicle infrastructure nationwide. 
Currently, 30C provides a 30 percent 
investment tax credit for alternative 
fuel vehicle refueling property, which 
includes electric charging stations and 
hydrogen refueling stations. This tax 
credit expires on December 31, 2020. 
Today, the 30C investment tax credit, 
as it is structured and interpreted by 
the Internal Revenue Service, only al-
lows the credit to be used on a per-lo-
cation basis rather than on a per-de-
vice basis, which means that only one 
charging station per public parking ga-
rage could qualify for the credit. That 
current structure and interpretation of 
the credit makes it difficult to finance 
multiple charging or refueling stations 
at one location, or to finance expan-
sions of one location in the future. The 
Securing America’s Clean Fuels Infra-
structure Act makes clear that the 30C 
investment tax credit can be applied to 
each item of refueling property (such 
as each charger) rather than per loca-
tion. 
Additionally, the current $30,000 cap 
on business investments does not pro-
vide adequate support for the installa-
tion of today’s fast-charging electric 
vehicle stations or hydrogen refueling 
stations. The Securing America’s Clean 
Fuels Infrastructure Act increases the 
30C investment tax cap for business in-
vestments from $30,000 to $200,000 for 
each item of refueling property. 
Finally, this legislation will also ex-
tend the credit for eight more years, to 
December 31, 2028, ensuring that the 
business community has the certainty 
needed to make long-term investments 
in clean fuels infrastructure. 
Our legislation is a commonsense 
way Congress can spur economic in-
vestments in our nation’s aging infra-
structure, help reduce transportation 
pollution, and support the millions of 
Americans that are considering buying 
a clean car today or in the future. That 
is why this bipartisan legislation has 
won broad support from the business 
and environmental communities. This 
is legislation that I commend to my 
colleagues for their serious consider-
ation.

Xinjiang, and calling for an end to ar-

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the ‘‘Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 
2020’’. 
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows: 
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Statement of purpose. 
Sec. 3. Findings. 
Sec. 4. Sense of Congress. 
Sec. 5. Updating statement of United States

in

Sec. 10. Classified report. 
SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Act is to direct United 
States resources to address human rights 
violations and abuses, including gross viola-
tions of human rights, by the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China through the 
mass surveillance and internment of over 
1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority 
groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China has a long history of repressing 
Turkic Muslims and other Muslim minority 
groups, particularly Uyghurs, in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region. In recent dec-
ades, central and regional Chinese govern-
ment policies have systematically discrimi-
nated against these minority groups by de-
nying them a range of civil and political 
rights, including the freedom of expression, 
religion, and movement, and the right to a 
fair trial. 
(2) In May 2014, the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China launched its lat-
est ‘‘Strike Hard Against Violent Extre-
mism’’ campaign, using wide-scale, inter-
nationally-linked threats of terrorism as a 
pretext to justify pervasive restrictions on 
and serious human rights violations of mem-
bers of ethnic minority communities in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The 
August 2016 appointment of former Tibet Au-
tonomous Region Party Secretary Chen 
Quanguo to be Party Secretary of Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region accelerated the 
crackdown 
across 
the 
region. 
Scholars, 
human rights organizations, journalists, and 
think tanks have provided ample evidence 
substantiating the establishment by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China of internment camps. Since 2014, the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China has detained more than 1,000,000 
Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and mem-
bers of other Muslim minority groups in 
these camps. The total ethnic minority pop-
ulation of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion was approximately 13,000,000 at the time 
of the last census conducted by the People’s 
Republic of China in 2010. 
(3) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China’s actions against Uyghurs, eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other 
Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region violate international 
human rights laws and norms, including— 
(A) the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimi-
nation, to which the People’s Republic of 
China has acceded; 
(B) the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treat-
ment or Punishment, which the People’s Re-
public of China has signed and ratified; 
(C) the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, which the People’s Re-
public of China has signed; and 
(D) the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. 
(4) Senior Chinese Communist Party offi-
cials, including current Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region Party Secretary Chen 
Quanguo, who executes Chinese government 
policy in the region, and former Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region Deputy Party 
Secretary Zhu Hailun, who crafted many of 
the policies implemented in the region, bear 
direct responsibility for gross human rights 
violations committed against Uyghurs, eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other 
Muslim minority groups. These abuses in-
clude the arbitrary detention of more than 
1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority 
groups, separation of working age adults 
from children and the elderly, and the inte-
gration of forced labor into supply chains. 
(5) Those detained in internment camps in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have 
described forced political indoctrination, 
torture, beatings, food deprivation, and de-
nial of religious, cultural, and linguistic 
freedoms. These victims have confirmed that 
they were told by guards that the only way 
to secure their release was to demonstrate 
sufficient political loyalty. Poor conditions 
and lack of medical treatment at such facili-
ties appear to have contributed to the deaths 
of some detainees, including the elderly and 
infirm. 
(6) Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs who have 
obtained permanent residence or citizenship 
in other countries report being subjected to 
threats and harassment from Chinese offi-
cials. At least 5 journalists for Radio Free 
Asia’s Uyghur service have publicly detailed 
abuses their family members in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region have endured in 
response to their work exposing the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China’s abu-
sive policies. 
(7) In September 2018, United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle 
Bachelet noted in her first speech as High 
Commissioner the ‘‘deeply disturbing allega-
tions of large-scale arbitrary detentions of 
Uighurs and other Muslim communities, in 
so-called 
reeducation 
camps 
across 
Xinjiang’’. 
(8) In 2019, the Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China concluded that, based 
on available evidence, the establishment and 
actions committed in the internment camps 
in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region may 
constitute ‘‘crimes against humanity’’. 
(9) On December 31, 2018, President Donald 
J. Trump signed into law the Asia Reassur-
ance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115– 
409), which— 
(A) condemns the People’s Republic of Chi-
na’s ‘‘forced disappearances, extralegal de-
tentions, invasive and omnipresent surveil-
lance, and lack of due process in judicial pro-
ceedings’’; 
(B) authorizes funding to promote democ-
racy, human rights, and the rule of law in 
the People’s Republic of China; and 
(C) supports sanctions designations against 
any entity or individual that— 
(i) violates human rights or religious free-
doms; or 
(ii) engages in censorship activities. 
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the President should— 
(A) condemn abuses against Uyghurs, eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, members of other Mus-
lim minority groups, and other persons by 
authorities of the People’s Republic of 
China; and 
(B) call on such authorities to imme-
diately— 
(i) close the internment camps; 
(ii) lift all restrictions on, and ensure re-
spect for, human rights; and 
(iii) allow people inside the People’s Re-
public of China to reestablish contact with 
their loved ones, friends, and associates out-
side the People’s Republic of China; 
(2) the Secretary of State should consider 
strategically employing sanctions and other 
tools under the International Religious Free-
dom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.), in-
cluding measures resulting from the designa-
tion of the People’s Republic of China as a 
country of particular concern for religious 
freedom under section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii) of such 
Act (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)(ii)), that directly 
address particularly severe violations of reli-
gious freedom; 
(3) the Secretary of State should— 
(A) work with United States allies and 
partners and through multilateral institu-
tions to condemn the mass arbitrary deten-
tion of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority 
groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion; and 
(B) coordinate closely with the inter-
national community on targeted sanctions 
and visa restrictions; 
(4) the journalists of the Uyghur language 
service of Radio Free Asia should be com-
mended for their reporting on the human 
rights and political situation in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region despite efforts 
by the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China to silence or intimidate their re-
porting through the detention of family 
members and relatives in China; 
(5) the United States should expand the 
availability of and capacity for Uyghur lan-
guage programming on Radio Free Asia in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; 
(6) the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
appropriate United States law enforcement 
agencies should take steps to hold account-
able officials from the People’s Republic of 
China or individuals acting on their behalf 
who harass, threaten, or intimidate persons 
within the United States; and 
(7) United States companies and individ-
uals selling goods or services or otherwise 
operating in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region should take steps, including in any 
public or financial filings, to ensure that— 
(A) their commercial activities are not 
contributing to human rights violations in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region or 
elsewhere in China; and 
(B) their supply chains are not com-
promised by forced labor.

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. CORNYN, and Ms. HARRIS): 
S. 3746. A bill to amend the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 to include cer-
tain employment as a health care prac-
titioner as eligible for public service 
loan forgiveness, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to talk about an issue of 
critical importance to California: doc-
tor shortages. 
First, I want to express my deepest 
appreciation and gratitude to the en-
tire medical community, particularly 
the doctors, nurses, and support staff 
who have been on the frontlines of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Amidst a severe 
shortage of protective equipment, they 
nevertheless continue to work around 
the clock to save countless lives. I— 
and 
my 
colleagues—are 
eternally 
grateful to you. 
I have heard from countless Califor-
nians who have said the same thing: we 
need more doctors. 
That is why Congress established the 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness Pro-
gram in 2007 to encourage doctors to 
pursue careers at public and nonprofit 
facilities, especially in areas experi-
encing physician shortages. As a re-
sult, physicians who provide care in a 
nonprofit or public hospital can have 
their student debt forgiven by the Pub-
lic Service Loan Forgiveness Program 
after making 120 qualifying monthly 
payments under a qualifying repay-
ment plan. 
However, when the Department of 
Education issued implementing guid-
ance for the program, it unintention-
ally excluded California and Texas phy-
sicians from being eligible to receive 
loan forgiveness. Under state law in 
California and Texas, doctors are pre-
vented from being directly employed 
by corporations, including nonprofit 
organizations. As a result, physicians 
in California and Texas who provide 
medical services at nonprofit hospitals 
do not qualify for the Public Service 
Loan Forgiveness program. 
To make matters worse, the United 
States is facing a shortage of physi-
cians. According to the Association of 
American Medical Colleges, our Nation 
can expect a shortage of up to nearly 
122,000 physicians by 2032 as demand for 
physicians continues to grow. Cali-
fornia alone will need an additional 
10,000 primary care doctors. 
During this difficult and challenging 
time, it is clear that more medical pro-
fessionals are needed. And long after 
this pandemic ends, we will still need 
more doctors to provide high-quality 
care, in both rural and urban areas. 
That is why I am pleased to intro-
duce the bipartisan ‘‘Stopping Doctor 
Shortages Act.’’ This legislation would 
help attract more doctors to public 
service and address the looming physi-
cian shortage by fixing a loophole that 
prevents thousands of doctors from 
participating in the Public Service 
Loan Forgiveness Program. 
According to the California Medical 
Association, this bill alone could bring 
as many as 10,000 physicians to Cali-
fornia over the next ten years. 
Similar legislation, introduced in the 
House by Representatives JOSH HARD-
ER, PAUL COOK, JOAQUIN CASTRO, DAN 
CRENSHAW, and KAREN BASS, also en-
joys bipartisan support. 
I would like to thank Senators JOHN 
CORNYN and KAMALA HARRIS for their 
support on this critical issue and for 
cosponsoring the bill. 
I ask my colleagues to join us to 
right a wrong and pass the ‘‘Stopping 
Doctor Shortages Act’’ in a timely 
manner as we continue to find ways to 
combat the coronavirus pandemic and 
save lives. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor.

(2) would hold the Government of Iran re-
sponsible for upholding the rights of all Ira-
nian nationals, including members of the 
Baha’i Faith; 
Whereas according to the United States 
Commission on International Religious Free-
dom’s 2017 annual report, ‘‘Since 1979, [Ira-
nian] authorities have killed or executed 
more than 200 Baha’i leaders, and more than 
10,000 [Baha’i] have been dismissed from gov-
ernment and university jobs [in Iran]’’; 
Whereas the Report of the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
(A/74/188), dated July 18, 2019, provides, in 
part— 
(1) the Iranian authorities and the Iranian 
criminal justice system regard the Baha’is as 
‘‘unprotected infidels’’; 
(2) ‘‘the Baha’i Faith is regarded as a ‘mis-
guided sect’ and Baha’i worship and religious 
practices are deemed heresy’’; 
(3) ‘‘Baha’is have been murdered with im-
punity and violations of their human rights 
have not been investigated.’’; 
(4) members of the Baha’i Faith ‘‘fre-
quently face charges such as ‘breaching na-
tional security’, ‘propaganda against the 
holy regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran’ 
or ‘propaganda activities against the regime 
in the interests of the Baha’i sect’ ’’; 
(5) ‘‘Since August 2005, more than 1,168 Ba-
ha’is have been arrested and charged with 
vaguely worded offences.’’; 
(6) ‘‘There were a total of 95 Baha’is report-
edly arrested in 2018, compared with at least 
84 in 2017 and 81 in 2016.’’; 
(7) ‘‘On 1 January 2019, the court of appeal 
of Isfahan reportedly condemned, in separate 
judgments, nine Baha’i citizens to a total of 
48 years of prison. They had been charged 
with ‘membership of the illegal Baha’i com-
munity and propaganda against the regime 
by spreading the Baha’i Faith in the soci-
ety.’ ’’; 
(8) Since 2007, in response to a letter from 
the Security Unit of the Public Place Super-
vision Office of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
to police commanders throughout the coun-
try, Baha’is have been banned from specific 
professions, to halt their entry into high 
earning businesses; and 
(9) ‘‘Since 2013, there have been more than 
803 incidents of violations of economic rights 
of the Baha’is, including arbitrary shop clo-
sures, unfair dismissals from employment 
and the actual or threatened revocation of 
business licenses.’’; 
Whereas the Iran section of the Depart-
ment of State’s 2018 Report on International 
Religious Freedom provides, in part— 
(1) ‘‘[N]on-Shia Muslims and those affili-
ated with a religion other than Islam, espe-
cially members of the Baha’i community, 
continued to face societal discrimination 
and harassment, and employers experienced 
social pressures not to hire Baha’is or to dis-
miss them from their private sector jobs.’’; 
and 
(2) ‘‘The law bars Baha’is from founding 
their own educational institutions. A Min-
istry of Science, Research, and Technology 
order requires universities to exclude Baha’is 
from access to higher education or expel 
them if their religious affiliation becomes 
known.’’; 
Whereas on March 11, 2020, the Department 
of State released the 2019 Country Reports 
on Human Rights Practices, which provides, 
in part— 
(1) Iranian ‘‘[a]uthorities barred Baha’i 
students from higher education’’; and 
(2) ‘‘According to a Baha’i International 
Community report April 2018, Iranian au-
thorities directed authorities in Houthi-con-
trolled areas of Yemen to harass and detain 
Baha’is because of their religious affili-
ation’’; 
Whereas the Baha’i International Commu-
nity has documented more than 26,000 items 
of anti-Baha’i propaganda in Iran’s official 
and semi-official media since January 2014. 
Whereas since 2019, the Government of Iran 
has excluded Baha’is from receiving national 
identification cards, which are required for 
accessing basic everyday necessities, includ-
ing obtaining a passport, making bank trans-
actions, and getting work permits. 
Whereas the Iranian Parliament (formally 
known as the ‘‘Islamic Consultative Assem-
bly’’) is considering a bill to amend Articles 
499 and 500 of Book 5 of the Islamic Penal 
Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran to crim-
inalize all activities in support of any reli-
gious minority that is not recognized under 
Iran’s constitution. 
Whereas the Government of Iran is a party 
to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, done at New York Decem-
ber 19, 1966, and the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
done at New York December 16, 1966, and is 
in violation of its obligations under such 
covenants; 
Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive 
Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divest-
ment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514) authorizes 
the President to impose sanctions on individ-
uals who are ‘‘responsible for or complicit in, 
or responsible for ordering, controlling, or 
otherwise directing, the commission of seri-
ous human rights abuses against citizens of 
Iran or their family members on or after 
June 12, 2009’’; and 
Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and 
Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Public Law 
112–158) amends and expands the authorities 
established under the Comprehensive Iran 
Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment 
Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–195) to sanction 
Iranian human rights abusers: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the Government of Iran’s 
state-sponsored persecution of its Baha’i mi-
nority and its continued violation of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Polit-
ical Rights and the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
(2) calls on the Government of Iran — 
(A) to immediately release the imprisoned 
or detained Baha’is and all other prisoners 
held solely on account of their religion; 
(B) to end its state-sponsored campaign of 
hate propaganda against the Baha’is; and 
(C) to reverse state-imposed policies deny-
ing equal opportunities to higher education, 
earning a livelihood, due process under the 
law, and the free exercise of religious prac-
tices; 
(3) calls on the President and the Secretary 
of State, in cooperation with responsible na-
tions— 
(A) to immediately condemn the Govern-
ment of Iran’s continued violation of human 
rights; and 
(B) to demand the immediate release of 
prisoners held solely on account of their reli-
gion; and 
(4) urges the President and the Secretary 
of State to utilize available authorities to 
impose sanctions on officials of the Govern-
ment of Iran and other individuals directly 
responsible for serious human rights abuses, 
including abuses against the Iranian Baha’i 
community.

S. RES. 579 
Whereas there is a rich history of coordi-
nated global health collaboration and coordi-
nation, dating back to 1851, to strategically 
and effectively combat deadly diseases of the 
time, such as the spread of plague; 
Whereas the United States has long been 
an active and critical leader in such global 
public health efforts, providing financial and 
technical support to multilateral institu-
tions, foreign governments, and nongovern-
mental organizations; 
Whereas international collaboration has 
led to a number of historic global health 
achievements, including the eradication of 
smallpox, the reduction of polio cases by 99 
percent, the elimination of river blindness, 
the decline in maternal and child mortality, 
the recognition of tobacco as a health haz-
ard, and countless others; 
Whereas there has been bipartisan support 
in the United States to lead efforts to ad-
dress global health needs, as evidenced by 
initiatives such as the President’s Emer-
gency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and 
the President’s Malaria Initiative; 
Whereas, most recently, the United States 
led the global effort to stem the spread of 
Ebola, thereby avoiding a global pandemic 
and American deaths; 
Whereas these bipartisan investments in 
global health have helped not only save 
countless lives around the world, but also at 
home in the United States; 
Whereas an outbreak of coronavirus dis-
ease 2019 (COVID–19) was first identified in 
December 2019, with a global pandemic dec-
laration by the World Health Organization 
on March 11, 2020;

United States are known to have died due to 
COVID–19 as of May 13, 2020, and a long-term, 
sustainable 
solution 
will

quiring a coordinated global effort; 
Whereas 
the 
interconnectivity 
of 
our 
globalized world means an infectious disease 
can travel around the world in as little as 36 
hours; 
Whereas United States Federal agencies 
have engaged in and supported certain re-
search 
and 
clinical 
trial 
efforts 
into 
coronaviruses, which may yield potential 
discoveries related to vaccine candidates; 
Whereas domestic and domestically sup-
ported vaccine candidates for COVID–19 only 
comprise a small fraction of the potential 
COVID–19 vaccine candidates undergoing 
studies worldwide; 
Whereas only international collaboration 
and coordination can ensure equitable access 
to safe, effective, and affordable therapeutics 
and vaccines, thereby saving Americans and 
others around the world; 
Whereas the United States has not yet 
joined ‘‘Solidarity’’, an international clin-
ical trial to rapidly identify effective treat-
ments for COVID–19; 
Whereas the United States has not yet 
joined the Coalition for Epidemic Prepared-
ness Innovations, an innovative global part-
nership which works to accelerate the devel-
opment of vaccines against emerging infec-
tious diseases and enable equitable access to 
these vaccines for people during outbreaks; 
Whereas 
United 
States 
opposition 
to 
stronger international efforts to combat 
COVID–19 has created a rift within the Group 
of 20 and undermined such collective efforts 
and possible access for the United States to 
their successes; 
Whereas, on April 24, 2020, the United 
States declined to participate in a virtual 
event led by a number of multilateral insti-
tutions, government leaders, and public 
health and industry leaders from around the 
world to accelerate new COVID–19 health 
technologies; 
Whereas, on May 4, 2020, the United States 
declined to participate in a subsequent vir-
tual summit led by the President of the Eu-
ropean Commission, where nations around 
the world—excluding the United States— 
pledged more than $8,000,000,000 to quickly 
develop vaccines and treatment to fight 
COVID–19; and 
Whereas, on June 4, 2020, the United King-
dom will host another virtual international 
summit on accelerating the development of a 
vaccine for COVID–19, including to support

Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the historic leadership role 
of the United States in stemming global 
health crises in the past; 
(2) commends the historic achievements of 
the international community in addressing 
global public health crises, such as the eradi-
cation of smallpox and dramatic progress in

vaccine within the United States and with 
support from Federal agencies; 
(5) acknowledges the vast international re-
search enterprise and collaboration under-
way to study an expansive range of drug and 
vaccine candidates; 
(6) urges renewed United States leadership 
and participation in any global efforts on 
therapeutics and vaccine development and 
delivery to address COVID–19 and prevent 
further American deaths; and 
(7) calls on the United States Government 
to boost funding for, and strengthen collabo-

S. RES. 580 
Whereas 23,000,000 Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders account for 7 percent of the 
population in the United States; 
Whereas over 2,000,000 Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders are working on the 
front lines of the COVID–19 pandemic in 
health care, law enforcement, first response, 
and transportation, as well as in service in-
dustries that involve keeping supermarkets 
operational; 
Whereas the use of anti-Asian terminology 
and rhetoric related to COVID–19, such as 
the ‘‘Chinese Virus’’, ‘‘Wuhan Virus’’, and 
‘‘Kung-flu’’, have perpetuated anti-Asian 
stigma; 
Whereas, since January 2020, there has 
been a dramatic increase in reports of hate 
crimes and incidents against those of Asian 
descent; 
Whereas, according to a recent study, 
there were over 400 cases of anti-Asian dis-
crimination related to COVID–19 between 
February 9, 2020, and March 7, 2020; 
Whereas the increased use of anti-Asian 
rhetoric has resulted in Asian Americans 
being harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated 
for the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, in incidents of anti-Asian vio-
lence occurring in March 2020, a woman 
wearing a mask was kicked and punched at 
a New York City subway station, 2 children 
and 2 adults were stabbed at a wholesale gro-
cery in Midland, Texas, a couple was as-
saulted and robbed by a group of attackers in 
Philadelphia, and a 16-year-old boy was sent 
to the hospital after being attacked by bul-
lies in Los Angeles, California; 
Whereas the increased use of anti-Asian 
rhetoric has also resulted in Asian American 
businesses being targeted for vandalism; 
Whereas there are approximately 2,000,000 
Asian American-owned businesses that gen-
erate over $700,000,000,000 in annual revenue 
and employ millions of workers; 
Whereas more than 1,900,000 Asian Amer-
ican and Pacific Islander older adults, par-
ticularly those older adults who are recent 
immigrants or have limited English pro-
ficiency, may face even greater challenges in 
dealing with the COVID–19 pandemic, includ-
ing discrimination, economic insecurity, and 
language isolation; 
Whereas the World Health Organization 
(WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) recognize that naming 
COVID–19 by its geographic location or link-
ing COVID–19 to a specific ethnicity perpet-
uates stigma; 
Whereas, in 2015, the WHO issued guidance 
calling on media outlets, scientists, and na-
tional authorities to avoid naming infectious 
diseases for locations to avoid stigmatizing 
groups of people; 
Whereas, on February 27, 2020, the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services stated, 
‘‘ethnicity is not what causes the novel 
coronavirus’’ and that it is inappropriate and 
inaccurate to call COVID–19 the ‘‘Chinese 
virus’’; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2020, Dr. Mitch 
Wolfe, the Chief Medical Officer of the CDC, 
said, ‘‘stigma is the enemy of public health’’; 
Whereas, on March 10, 2020, Dr. Robert 
Redfield, the Director of the CDC, testified 
that use of the term ‘‘Chinese coronavirus’’ 
is wrong and inappropriate; and 
Whereas the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations called for international soli-
darity and an end to any ill-founded dis-
crimination against the outbreak’s victims: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) calls on all public officials to condemn 
and denounce anti-Asian sentiment in any 
form; 
(2) recognizes that the health and safety of 
all Americans, no matter their background, 
must be the utmost priority; 
(3) condemns all manifestations or expres-
sions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, 
anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and eth-
nic or religious intolerance; 
(4) calls on Federal law enforcement offi-
cials, working with State and local offi-
cials— 
(A) to expeditiously investigate and docu-
ment all credible reports of hate crimes, in-
cidents, and threats against the Asian Amer-
ican and Pacific Islander community in the 
United States; 
(B) to collect data to document the rise of 
incidents of hate crimes relating to COVID– 
19; and 
(C) to hold the perpetrators of those 
crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and 
bring such perpetrators to justice, including 
through investigation and prosecution; and 
(5) recommits the United States to serving 
as a world leader in building more inclusive, 
diverse, and tolerant societies— 
(A) by prioritizing language access and

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as

2020’’. 
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows: 
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Statement of purpose. 
Sec. 3. Findings.

of

in

the People’s Republic of China. 
Sec. 10. Classified report. 
SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Act is to direct United 
States resources to address human rights 
violations and abuses, including gross viola-
tions of human rights, by the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China through the 
mass surveillance and internment of over 
1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority 
groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China has a long history of repressing 
Turkic Muslims and other Muslim minority 
groups, particularly Uyghurs, in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region. In recent dec-
ades, central and regional Chinese govern-
ment policies have systematically discrimi-
nated against these minority groups by de-
nying them a range of civil and political 
rights, including the freedom of expression, 
religion, and movement, and the right to a 
fair trial. 
(2) In May 2014, the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China launched its lat-
est ‘‘Strike Hard Against Violent Extre-
mism’’ campaign, using wide-scale, inter-
nationally-linked threats of terrorism as a 
pretext to justify pervasive restrictions on 
and serious human rights violations of mem-
bers of ethnic minority communities in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The 
August 2016 appointment of former Tibet Au-
tonomous Region Party Secretary Chen 
Quanguo to be Party Secretary of Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region accelerated the 
crackdown 
across 
the 
region. 
Scholars, 
human rights organizations, journalists, and 
think tanks have provided ample evidence 
substantiating the establishment by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China of internment camps. Since 2014, the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China has detained more than 1,000,000 
Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and mem-
bers of other Muslim minority groups in 
these camps. The total ethnic minority pop-
ulation of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion was approximately 13,000,000 at the time 
of the last census conducted by the People’s 
Republic of China in 2010. 
(3) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China’s actions against Uyghurs, eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other 
Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region violate international 
human rights laws and norms, including— 
(A) the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimi-
nation, to which the People’s Republic of 
China has acceded; 
(B) the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treat-
ment or Punishment, which the People’s Re-
public of China has signed and ratified; 
(C) the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, which the People’s Re-
public of China has signed; and 
(D) the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. 
(4) Senior Chinese Communist Party offi-
cials, including current Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region Party Secretary Chen 
Quanguo, who executes Chinese government 
policy in the region, and former Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region Deputy Party 
Secretary Zhu Hailun, who crafted many of 
the policies implemented in the region, bear 
direct responsibility for gross human rights 
violations committed against Uyghurs, eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other 
Muslim minority groups. These abuses in-
clude the arbitrary detention of more than 
1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority 
groups, separation of working age adults 
from children and the elderly, and the inte-
gration of forced labor into supply chains. 
(5) Those detained in internment camps in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have 
described forced political indoctrination, 
torture, beatings, food deprivation, and de-
nial of religious, cultural, and linguistic 
freedoms. These victims have confirmed that 
they were told by guards that the only way 
to secure their release was to demonstrate 
sufficient political loyalty. Poor conditions 
and lack of medical treatment at such facili-
ties appear to have contributed to the deaths 
of some detainees, including the elderly and 
infirm. 
(6) Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs who have 
obtained permanent residence or citizenship 
in other countries report being subjected to 
threats and harassment from Chinese offi-
cials. At least 5 journalists for Radio Free 
Asia’s Uyghur service have publicly detailed 
abuses their family members in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region have endured in 
response to their work exposing the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China’s abu-
sive policies. 
(7) In September 2018, United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle 
Bachelet noted in her first speech as High 
Commissioner the ‘‘deeply disturbing allega-
tions of large-scale arbitrary detentions of 
Uighurs and other Muslim communities, in 
so-called 
reeducation 
camps 
across 
Xinjiang’’. 
(8) In 2019, the Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China concluded that, based 
on available evidence, the establishment and 
actions committed in the internment camps 
in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region may 
constitute ‘‘crimes against humanity’’. 
(9) On December 31, 2018, President Donald 
J. Trump signed into law the Asia Reassur-
ance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115– 
409), which— 
(A) condemns the People’s Republic of Chi-
na’s ‘‘forced disappearances, extralegal de-
tentions, invasive and omnipresent surveil-
lance, and lack of due process in judicial pro-
ceedings’’; 
(B) authorizes funding to promote democ-
racy, human rights, and the rule of law in 
the People’s Republic of China; and 
(C) supports sanctions designations against 
any entity or individual that— 
(i) violates human rights or religious free-
doms; or 
(ii) engages in censorship activities. 
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the President should— 
(A) condemn abuses against Uyghurs, eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, members of other Mus-
lim minority groups, and other persons by 
authorities of the People’s Republic of 
China; and 
(B) call on such authorities to imme-
diately— 
(i) close the internment camps; 
(ii) lift all restrictions on, and ensure re-
spect for, human rights; and 
(iii) allow people inside the People’s Re-
public of China to reestablish contact with 
their loved ones, friends, and associates out-
side the People’s Republic of China; 
(2) the Secretary of State should consider 
strategically employing sanctions and other 
tools under the International Religious Free-
dom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.), in-
cluding measures resulting from the designa-
tion of the People’s Republic of China as a 
country of particular concern for religious 
freedom under section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii) of such 
Act (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)(ii)), that directly 
address particularly severe violations of reli-
gious freedom; 
(3) the Secretary of State should— 
(A) work with United States allies and 
partners and through multilateral institu-
tions to condemn the mass arbitrary deten-
tion of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority 
groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion; and 
(B) coordinate closely with the inter-
national community on targeted sanctions 
and visa restrictions; 
(4) the journalists of the Uyghur language 
service of Radio Free Asia should be com-
mended for their reporting on the human 
rights and political situation in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region despite efforts 
by the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China to silence or intimidate their re-
porting through the detention of family 
members and relatives in China; 
(5) the United States should expand the 
availability of and capacity for Uyghur lan-
guage programming on Radio Free Asia in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; 
(6) the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
appropriate United States law enforcement 
agencies should take steps to hold account-
able officials from the People’s Republic of 
China or individuals acting on their behalf 
who harass, threaten, or intimidate persons 
within the United States; and 
(7) United States companies and individ-
uals selling goods or services or otherwise 
operating in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous

public or financial filings, to ensure that—

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, since 
the Senate returned to Washington 2 
weeks ago after about a 6-week hiatus, 
we have accomplished quite a bit on a 
bipartisan basis. We have confirmed 
national security nominees; we have 
held hearings to examine liability limi-
tations, coronavirus testing, safely get-
ting back to work and school, and the 
impact of the pandemic on broadband. 
In short, the Senate has been working, 
on a bipartisan basis, to understand 
the challenges that this virus has cre-
ated so we can provide targeted re-
forms. 
It certainly seems to be a different 
approach than the one taken by the 
House. Earlier this week, House Demo-
crats released a so-called coronavirus 
relief bill. You might say they kind of 
mailed it in because they haven’t been 
here for the last 2 weeks, but it has an 
absolutely staggering pricetag—$3 tril-
lion, with a ‘‘t.’’ That is more than we 
spent in the first four coronavirus re-
sponse bills combined. 
I tell my constituents, when I am 
talking to them on a videoconference 
call or teleconference, that 2 months 
ago, I never would have imagined that 
the Senate would be voting on trillion- 
dollar bills, but now apparently the 
House wants to make this a routine 
way to do business and particularly 
without much debate. 
As astounding as that figure is, the 
biggest issue with that bill isn’t the 
cost or the fact that Speaker PELOSI 
and her party drafted it in secret but 
that they released the 1,800-page bill 
text on Tuesday, and they plan to vote 
on it tomorrow. Unbelievable. 
It would be an understatement to say 
there are concerns with this kind of 
legislating. I would call it legislative 
malpractice, to be kind. It is not just 
from Republicans or the administra-
tion or the American people; the 
Speaker’s own Members are begging for 
additional time to review this massive 
bill. Unlike the previous coronavirus 
response bills passed here in Congress, 
there have been no bipartisan discus-
sions in the production of that bill 
from the House—not with House Re-
publicans, not with the administration, 
and certainly not with us. I can assure 
you that this legislation looks just like 
the kind of product that you would ex-
pect from that type of flawed process. 
It is partisan; it is unaffordable; it is 
unrealistic; and it stands absolutely no 
chance of becoming law. 
We all know that legislation drafted 
in a vacuum by one political party in 
one Chamber isn’t a good-faith effort 
to try to survive, much less address, 
this pandemic crisis. It is a political 
statement as much as anything else, a 
liberal wish list which, if passed— 
which it will not be—would sink us fur-
ther in debt without the benefit of ad-
dressing the problems we are actually 
facing. 
When this legislation was announced, 
Speaker PELOSI said: 
We all know we must put more money in 
the pockets of the American people. This is 
not only necessary for their survival, but it 
is also a stimulus to the economy. 
But the ones set to reap the biggest 
benefits from this bill aren’t the ones 
struggling to make ends meet. Actu-
ally, what Speaker PELOSI is appar-
ently trying to do is help some of the 
wealthiest people in America. 
This legislation would reinstate the 
so-called SALT deduction—the State 
and local tax deduction—and thrust 
that burden of subsidizing the wealthi-
est people in the bluest parts of the 
country on the rest of us. We were able 
to cap that in a fair and realistic way 
in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2462 
May 14, 2020 
Prior to that tax reform, taxpayers 
who itemized their returns could de-
duct the amount of State and local 
taxes they paid with no limit. So, if 
you lived in a high-tax State like New 
York, there was no limit to your abil-
ity to deduct those State and local 
taxes. You know who paid for it? The 
people of Indiana, the people of Alaska, 
the people of Texas, and the people of 
other States who more responsibly 
dealt with their fiscal affairs. 
Now, for the average American, this 
change hasn’t even been a blip on the 
radar screen. For the millionaires and 
billionaires, though, the ones Speaker 
PELOSI’s bill would benefit most di-
rectly, this was a huge blow. 
People say, well, the wealthy ought 
to pay more. Well, OK. Here is a way 
for them to do it in the right way, but 
it is also a way to hold your State and 
local jurisdictions accountable for the 
high taxes they pass, only to pre-
viously allow those taxes to be de-
ducted from the Federal income tax, so 
this is a matter of political account-
ability for them, too. 
I am sure the wealthiest Americans 
were delighted to see that the Demo-
crats’ response to what Speaker PELOSI 
called the biggest catastrophe in our 
Nation’s history would allow them, 
once again, to reap the benefits of this 
no-limit deduction. If the SALT cap 
were removed, they would receive an 
average tax cut of nearly $60,000. That 
is higher than the household income 
for many Texans and many Americans. 
To make matters worse, this would 
sink our country further in debt. 
The nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Tax estimates that doing away with 
the SALT cap would cost about $700 
billion over the next 7 years, with al-
most 95 percent of the benefit going to 
those making at least $200,000 and more 
than half going to those making more 
than $1 million a year. 
Now, we have spent a lot of money in 
the last couple of months, but we have 
done so in the face of an emergency— 
kind of like the civilian equivalent of 
World War II—fighting this virus, both 
the public health and the economic 
consequences, so we are already look-
ing at staggering debt that we are 
going to have to deal with at some 
point because it is immoral to expect 
our kids and grandkids to pay that 
money back after we have already 
cashed those checks. 
But this just adds insult to injury, 
what Speaker PELOSI and House Demo-
crats are trying to do. Even the liberal 
Tax Policy Center reported that one- 
third of the SALT deduction went to 
the top 1 percent. We hear our Demo-
crat friends talk about income inequal-
ity and the top 1 percent needing to 
pay more. Well, then, their actions are 
directly contrary to their rhetoric. We 
know 80 percent of the benefit went to 
the top 20 percent income earners. 
Now, we are not trying to start a 
civil war here between people who are 
doing well and people who are not 
doing well, but this just makes abso-
lutely no sense, particularly in the face 
of a crisis like the coronavirus. This 
isn’t an attempt to support those who 
are struggling to make ends meet. 
That is who we ought to be focusing on: 
the people who are not getting a pay-
check because their business has been 
shut down, their restaurant, their bar, 
their sports stadium. This is a get-out- 
of-jail-free card for millionaires and 
billionaires who don’t want to pay 
their fair share of taxes and would foist 
that unfairly onto others. 
Now, I realize that is only a small 
portion of the bill. After all, it is a $3 
trillion bill. So let’s dive into a couple 
of other things—changes, for example, 
they would make in unemployment in-
surance. The CARES Act we passed—I 
think it was March 25—expanded unem-
ployment benefits to include workers 
who would not typically be eligible for 
those benefits, the self-employed and 
independent contractors. It also pro-
vided an additional $600 of Federal ben-
efit on top of the State’s unemploy-
ment benefit through the end of July, 
for 4 months. 
The theory behind that was to pro-
vide workers who lost their jobs with 
the money they needed to pay for the 
necessities of life until the economy 
could reopen and they could go back to 
work. 
Slowly but surely, businesses across 
this country are starting to reopen 
their doors—safely and gradually re-
open their doors—and many are facing 
an unlikely burden, which is now get-
ting people to come back to work. Over 
the last several weeks, I have heard 
Texas businesses struggling to rehire 
their employees because they are mak-
ing more from unemployment than 
they would if they worked. 
And it is not an isolated issue. Ac-
cording to the Texas Workforce Com-
mission that administers our unem-
ployment insurance program, 80 per-
cent of the people are making more 
money on unemployment than they 
were when previously employed—80 
percent. 
Now, that clearly was a mistake in 
the underlying bill. It is true that, 
when you do something that big and 
that fast, you are going to make some 
mistakes, but nobody can think this is 
sound public policy: to pay people more 
for not working than when they do 
work. 
Here is what House Democrats do. 
They extend that mistake through 
next January, providing even less of an 
incentive for workers to find new jobs. 
The United States can’t be the success-
ful economy that we are capable of 
being or have been by encouraging peo-
ple not to work. At a certain point, 
these benefits are going to do more 
harm than good, and I would say they 
are already starting to do that. So, ex-
tending unemployment benefits to next 
year would deter people from trying to 
return to work because, why would 
they? Why would someone choose to do 
more work for less money? 
Well, I understand the need to sup-
port the American people until they 
are able to get back on their feet, but 
I am afraid this move would stunt— 
would retard—any hope of economic re-
covery, and it would deepen the hiring 
struggle businesses are already fac-
ing—and I am glad that they are hir-
ing—and ensure that the ‘‘Sorry, we’re 
closed’’ sign remains on the door of 
Main Street businesses throughout the 
country. 
As we begin to recover from the eco-
nomic crisis that this virus has caused, 
our country will need a lot more from 
Congress than a blank check written in 
a back room. Rushing to appear to do 
something while doing absolutely noth-
ing, which is what House Democrats 
have done, will not do any good unless 
we are taking the time to find out 
what 
America’s 
healthcare 
profes-
sionals, small businesses, and workers 
actually need. 
That is what we are doing every day: 
listening. How is what we have already 
done working? What are the mistakes 
that need to be corrected? Where are 
the gaps that need to be filled—at a 
time when about a half-trillion dollars 
of that money from the CARES Act 
isn’t even out the door yet from the 
Main Street lending facility that is 
being set up through the Federal Re-
serve. 
I am not blaming Treasury. I am just 
saying, they are covered up, and they 
are working 24/7, but let’s see how what 
we have already done works before we 
continue to shovel more money aim-
lessly out the door. 
Earlier this week, the Judiciary 
Committee held a hearing to examine 
liability around the coronavirus pan-
demic. One of our witnesses was Kevin 
Smartt, a Texan from Bonham, TX— 
the home of Sam Rayburn—who is CEO 
and President of Kwik Chek food 
stores. I think he has 47 fast-food 
stores. In his opening statement, he 
outlined the steps that Kwik Chek 
took to protect the safety of its em-
ployees 
and 
customers 
while 
con-
tinuing to provide access to essential 
items like food and fuel. 
They followed the constantly shifting 
guidelines from the CDC and other Fed-
eral, State, and local government agen-
cies and adjusted and adapted accord-
ingly. 
Like 
millions 
of 
businesses 
across the country, Kwik Chek imple-
mented strict cleaning protocols. They 
installed sneeze guards in their stores, 
they put markers on the floor to help 
customers maintain social distancing, 
and they made every effort to obtain 
masks and hand sanitizer, but have 
often struggled to overcome supply dis-
ruptions. 
In his testimony, Kevin said: 
Unfortunately, despite trying to do every-
thing we can to protect the health and safety 
of our customers and employees during this 
pandemic, my companies now have targets 
on our back because our doors have remained 
open. That’s just not right. We are all in this 
together, and my businesses shouldn’t be-
come targets for liability threats just be-
cause they serve their communities. 
I found this is a common fear for 
businesses small and large alike, as

well as for our dedicated healthcare 
professionals. Can you imagine serving 
on the frontline of this fight against 
the pandemic, doing everything you 
can possibly do to help people who are 
sick and injured, and, despite acting in 
good faith to protect employees, cus-
tomers, or patients, we know that a 
certain element of the bar are lining up 
to file opportunistic lawsuits against 
these hard-working men and women, 
people who I think we all consider to 
be heroes. 
Across the country, lawsuits have al-
ready begun rolling in by the hundreds. 
Unless we take action, we are going to 
wake up from this pandemic only to 
find ourselves in a legal nightmare. 
Now, I want to be clear. Bad actors 
don’t deserve blanket immunity. We 
are all in agreement on that point, but 
hard-working Americans who are try-
ing to do the best thing and follow, in 
good faith, the guidance that their gov-
ernment gives them deserve a safe har-
bor from frivolous litigation and nui-
sance lawsuits. This Chamber is full of 
lawyers—Democrat 
lawyers, 
Repub-
lican lawyers—who are well aware of 
just how damaging this unlimited liti-
gation that will ensue will be on our 
economic recovery. 
While House Democrats have been 
crafting their dead-on-arrival liberal 
wish list, we have been working on leg-
islation which can and should gain bi-
partisan support and protect our front-
line workers in the process. 
We are working on legislation to pro-
vide liability protections for the men 
and women who have supported us 
through this crisis and who will be the 
key to our recovery from this crisis. 
We simply must protect those who 
have acted in good faith from having to 
defend costly legal battles—only to 
win—only to lose their business be-
cause they can’t survive that addi-
tional burden—going through the pan-
demic, the shutdown, only to find, just 
when you think you are coming out of 
it, that you are being drowned with 
litigation costs. 
I believe we should continue to pro-
vide an opportunity to seek legal re-
course for those who act willfully or 
exercise reckless disregard for the 
health and safety of others. Those are 
the kinds of cases that deserve, in my 
opinion, access to compensation. 
Make no mistake, our country’s road 
to recovery isn’t going to be easy, and 
we have already caught a glimpse of 
the next epidemic, the lawsuit epi-
demic, that is waiting around the cor-
ner. 
Unlike House Democrats, who are 
moving full-speed ahead, the Senate 
has chosen to tap the brakes and figure 
out the best way to avoid hitting the 
brakes, economically and from a public 
health perspective.

f 
SAFEGUARDING AMERICA’S FIRST 
RESPONDERS ACT OF 2020 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Judiciary 
Committee be discharged and that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 3607. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3607) to extend public safety offi-
cer death benefits to public safety officers 
whose death is caused by COVID–19, and for 
other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Grassley- 
Booker amendment at the desk be con-
sidered and agreed to, and that the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third 
time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 1587) was agreed 
to, as follows: 
(Purpose: To improve the bill) 
In section 2(a)(5), strike ‘‘deaths resulting 
from infectious disease sustained by public 
safety officers in carrying out their duties, 
the determination of claims may’’ and insert 
‘‘deaths and permanent and total disabilities 
resulting from infectious disease sustained 
by public safety officers in carrying out their 
duties, the determination of claims involv-
ing personal injuries believed to have re-
sulted from COVID–19 or its complications 
may’’. 
In section 3, strike ‘‘As determined’’ and 
insert 
‘‘(a) 
DEATH
BENEFITS.—As 
deter-
mined’’. 
At the end of section 3, add the following: 
(b) DISABILITY BENEFITS.—As determined 
by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, COVID– 
19 (or complications therefrom) suffered by a 
public safety officer shall be presumed to 
constitute a personal injury within the 
meaning of section 1201(b) of title I of the 
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act 
of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281(b)), sustained in the 
line of duty by the officer, if— 
(1) the officer engaged in a line of duty ac-
tion or activity between January 1, 2020, and 
December 31, 2021; and 
(2) the officer was diagnosed with COVID– 
19 (or evidence indicates that the officer had 
COVID–19) during the 45-day period begin-
ning on the last day of duty of the officer. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know 
of no further debate on the bill, as 
amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill pass? 
The bill (S. 3607), as amended, was 
passed, as follows: 
S. 3607 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe-
guarding America’s First Responders Act of 
2020’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) an infectious disease pandemic known 
as COVID–19 exists; 
(2) to date, there is much still unknown 
about COVID–19, but it is known that 
COVID–19 and related complications may be 
fatal; 
(3) services provided by public safety offi-
cers are nonetheless essential during this 
pandemic; 
(4) due to the COVID–19 pandemic and what 
is currently known about how the disease is 
spread, 
public 
safety 
officers 
are 
uncharacteristically at risk of contracting 
the disease; and 
(5) although the Public Safety Officers’ 
Benefits program currently covers deaths 
and permanent and total disabilities result-
ing from infectious disease sustained by pub-
lic safety officers in carrying out their du-
ties, the determination of claims involving 
personal injuries believed to have resulted 
from COVID–19 or its complications may be 
uniquely challenging or delayed given the 
lack of— 
(A) definitive testing and medical records 
at this time; and 
(B) a definitive uniform body of medical in-
formation about how the disease is spread or 
its effects. 
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to 
establish 
a 
carefully 
drawn 
framework 
wherein claims under the Public Safety Offi-
cers’ Benefits program, arising under the 
unique 
circumstances 
described 
in 
sub-
section (a), can be processed expeditiously 
and under fair and clear standards. 
SEC. 3. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER BENEFITS. 
(a) DEATH
BENEFITS.—As determined by 
the Bureau of Justice Assistance, unless 
competent medical evidence establishes that 
the death of a public safety officer (as de-
fined in section 1204 of title I of the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 
(34 U.S.C. 10284)) was directly and proxi-
mately caused by something other than 
COVID–19, 
COVID–19 
(or 
complications 
therefrom) suffered by the public safety offi-
cer shall be presumed to constitute a per-
sonal injury within the meaning of section 
1201(a) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 
10281(a)), sustained in the line of duty by the 
officer and directly and proximately result-
ing in death, if— 
(1) the officer engaged in a line of duty ac-
tion or activity between January 1, 2020, and 
December 31, 2021; 
(2) the officer was diagnosed with COVID– 
19 (or evidence indicates that the officer had 
COVID–19) during the 45-day period begin-
ning on the last day of duty of the officer; 
and 
(3) evidence indicates that the officer had 
COVID–19 (or complications therefrom) at 
the time of the officer’s death. 
(b) DISABILITY BENEFITS.—As determined 
by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, COVID– 
19 (or complications therefrom) suffered by a 
public safety officer shall be presumed to 
constitute a personal injury within the 
meaning of section 1201(b) of title I of the 
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act 
of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281(b)), sustained in the 
line of duty by the officer, if— 
(1) the officer engaged in a line of duty ac-
tion or activity between January 1, 2020, and 
December 31, 2021; and 
(2) the officer was diagnosed with COVID– 
19 (or evidence indicates that the officer had 
COVID–19) during the 45-day period begin-
ning on the last day of duty of the officer. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CONFIDENTIALITY

TIES FOR PEER SUPPORT COUN-

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Judiciary

TRIBUTE TO ADAM CRUM AND DR. 
ANNE ZINK 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday, and I am back on the Senate 
floor, partaking in one of my favorite 
times of the week, which is to come 
down to the floor and talk about some-
body who is making a great difference 
in my State. We call this individual 
our Alaskan of the Week. To those who 
watch the floor back home, sometimes 
we break the rules a little bit and rec-
ognize more than one person. We just 
call them the Alaskans of the Week, 
with an ‘‘s.’’ Pandemic or no pandemic, 
I think it is still important that we 
come down and recognize, particularly 
during these challenging times, people 
who are making a difference in our 
State and across our country. 
As I mentioned last week, this pan-
demic is definitely testing the char-
acter of our Nation. You might remem-
ber, right when it was hitting, some re-
porters from the Washington Post 
wrote a story, saying that Americans 
are going to be tested and that they 
don’t think they are going to be able to 
pass—maybe not like they had in 
World War II and at other times—that 
the mettle, the toughness, and the re-
siliency of Americans might not be 
able to get us through this. That was 
the Washington Post—classic, clueless, 
inside-the-beltway reporting. 
In my remarks on the floor—this was 
about 6 weeks ago—I said: You ought 
to come up to Alaska, Washington 
Post, and see my constituents, or 
maybe come out with my marines and 
see the marines. 
You have to know America. Alaska is 
America, and we are going to pass this 
test as a nation, and we are—all across 
the country and certainly in my great 
State. In small, rural villages and in 
urban centers, from the tundra to the 
rainforests, all across the State, people 
are helping each other. They are pass-
ing out food. They are helping the el-
derly, making sure they are not lonely. 
They are tending to those in need and 
are displaying generosity, strength, 
and amazing resilience. The paper 
should write more about that. 
Our frontline workers have now be-
come our national heroes. Some of 
them are working day in and day out 
to ensure that our grocery stores are 
stocked, that the goods are trans-
ported, that the buildings are main-
tained, that our telecommunication 
systems are running, that our air-
planes are flying, that our hospitals 
are open, and that our community 
healthcare workers can give care. The 
list, as we all know, goes on and on and 
on. 
Because of those back home, because 
of these great Americans all around 
our country, and because of what is 
happening in my State with our State’s 
leadership, Alaska has done well from a 
health standpoint in terms of this 
virus. Knock on wood, of course—and I 
am doing it—things could change. They 
could change anywhere. They certainly 
could change in Alaska, but so far so 
good. 
Alaskans are known for their rugged 
individualism. Alaskans are not natu-
rally people who automatically follow

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2467 
May 14, 2020 
orders without having a good reason to 
do so, but almost everybody across our 
State has taken this virus seriously in 
their helping one another and in their 
following the guidance that has been 
given by our State’s leaders. I chalk 
that up to good leadership from our 
very attentive mayors—city mayors, 
borough mayors—to our local leaders 
across the State, to our Governor, 
Mike Dunleavy, and to the healthcare 
team he put together in his adminis-
tration that was ready when this pan-
demic hit. 
I 
am 
going 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
healthcare team. It has been led by the 
commissioner of the Alaska Depart-
ment of Health and Social Services, 
Adam Crum, and by Alaska’s chief 
medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink. Both of 
them are our Alaskans of the week. 
They have both worked day and night 
throughout these past several weeks 
since this pandemic has hit our Nation, 
has hit my State, and they have been 
trying around the clock to keep our 
fellow Alaskans safe. As I mentioned, 
both are more than deserving of this 
very, very prestigious award. They 
have risen to the challenge in so many 
impressive ways in working for their 
State and their country. 
As Alaskans do, both of them have 
interesting life stories, compelling life 
stories. Let me tell you a little bit 
about both of them. 
Adam Crum lives in Wasilla with Col-
leen, his wife. He was born and raised 
in Alaska. He grew up on the Kenai Pe-
ninsula and went to Homer High 
School. He was a graduate there and a 
good football player. He went to North-
western and walked on the football 
team. That is Big Ten football. That 
takes a lot of guts—center, guard, of-
fensive lineman. He did great there. 
In fact, look at the Crums, his sib-
lings. They are a big family—impres-
sive, a big group. There are brains and 
brawn in that family. Adam’s three 
brothers all played college ball—Joey 
at Puget Sound, Richie at the Univer-
sity of Idaho, and Cody at West Texas 
A&M. Their dad also played at the Uni-
versity of Arkansas. Like I said, when 
you line up the Crum brothers, you 
look like you have a serious pro-foot-
ball offensive line right there. It is an 
impressive family. 
Adam 
enjoyed 
Northwestern 
and 
playing ball there, but on his first visit 
back home from college, he began to 
realize just how unique the great State 
of Alaska was where he grew up. He 
said: ‘‘For me, I really didn’t appre-
ciate it until I actually went some-
place else.’’ 
Like all of us who love the outdoors, 
the scenery, the diversity, the opportu-
nities, when he moved back from col-
lege, he was committed to coming back 
to our State to serve our State. He 
went into his family business. He got 
his master’s degree in public health 
from Johns Hopkins University. Then, 
when Governor Dunleavy, whom I men-
tioned, was elected in November of 
2018, Adam was offered the job of com-
missioner of Health and Social Serv-
ices. 
His starting date was going to be De-
cember 3, 2018, but in Alaska, there are 
always adventures and challenges, and 
on November 30, the south central part 
of our State got hit with a huge shock, 
a huge earthquake—7.1. There were 
cracking and collapsing roads and 
highways. It damaged buildings, de-
stroyed schools, knocked out power, 
and sent people scrambling outside and 
under furniture. It really damaged 
homes. So Adam, who was going to 
start this job in 3 days, said: I am 
going to start now. He moved up the 
start date and got to work. 
It was a crash course in health emer-
gency operations. Brand new on the 
job, his Health and Human Services de-
partment was in touch with all the 
hospitals, all the prisons, the elder care 
facilities, the Department of Military 
and Veterans Affairs. He watched and 
led these operations, everybody work-
ing together. Here is the miracle: In 
this huge earthquake during rush hour 
in Alaska, not one life was lost. It was 
remarkable—literally a miracle. He 
learned how to bring people together in 
emergency operations. That exercise 
was invaluable with what came next, 
and we all know what came next—the 
pandemic which has rocked our State, 
our country, and really our world. 
Alaska’s chief medical officer, Dr. 
Anne Zink, appears with Commissioner 
Adam Crum and Governor Dunleavy 
nearly every night to address Alaskans 
and our media in a press conference 
about where we are with regard to the 
health 
of 
our 
State 
and 
this 
coronavirus. Versions of this scene 
happen nearly every night across the 
country as Governors are addressing 
their public. But I am willing to ven-
ture to say that if there is a marker of 
success with such briefings, it is this: 
how much the people are trusting of 
what is being told to them. I would 
state that Alaska’s healthcare team, 
Commissioner Crum and Dr. Zink, have 
passed with flying colors. 
Dr. Zink is certainly one of the stars 
of this nightly show as she appears 
from her yurt in her backyard in Palm-
er, AK. She has become so popular in 
Alaska that there is even a Facebook 
page dedicated to her called ‘‘Think 
like Zink.’’ Rorie Watt, Juneau’s city 
manager, actually wrote an ode in her 
honor. It is a lengthy poem, and it 
starts like this: 
Oh Alaska, I love you and it feels like we 
are teetering on the brink; who can guide 
and steer us? The unflappable Dr. Zink! 
You know if a poem is written about 
you, you are doing a good job. 
Dr. Zink was raised in Colorado with 
physician parents. She was no stranger 
to Alaska. She worked as a mountain-
eering guide in Alaska during college. 
So after getting her M.D. from Stan-
ford, she made her way back to our 
great State 11 years ago and has 
worked 
as 
an 
ER 
doctor 
in 
the 
Matanuska Valley. 
Last July, she was with her family in 
Bhutan on a yearlong sabbatical when 
she got a call from Adam Crum, asking 
her to come to be the State’s Chief 
Medical Officer. Commissioner Crum, 
speaking like a true Big Ten football 
player, said: ‘‘She was my number 1 
draft pick.’’ 
So Commissioner Crum made the 
smart decision to bring on Dr. Zink to 
the medical team and healthcare team 
that he leads. Commissioner Crum and 
Dr. Zink have, along with the rest of 
the country, been closely watching the 
virus migrate from China to the United 
States since the early stages. Remem-
ber what happened when the State De-
partment brought our diplomats home 
from Wuhan. A planeload of our dip-
lomats were coming home, and they 
had to stop in Anchorage on January 28 
for a refueling stop. We later learned 
that nobody on the plane actually had 
the virus, but Commissioner Crum and 
Dr. Zink started to get our State 
ready. They prepared for the worst, 
contacting local and Tribal medical fa-
cilities. They were in constant coordi-
nation with the CDC. They were in 
communications with all the State 
agencies and divisions and, very, very 
importantly, with the public. 
This began their outreach to our citi-
zens. They have continued that fren-
zied pace ever since, working day and 
night with the Governor’s office to try 
their best to keep the virus at bay, to 
keep our citizens healthy, and so far it 
is working. 
Like other places, businesses in Alas-
ka have been shut down and are now 
slowly beginning to open back up. We 
need to open back up. We need to keep 
our citizens healthy, but we need to get 
our economy open and moving again. 
Among the other precautions, the 
Governor established a ban for a time 
on travel throughout the State and a 
14-day quarantine still in place for any-
body who comes from outside of Alaska 
to the State. Commissioner Crum said 
that mandate was probably the most 
effective thing they have done so far to 
keep the virus from spreading. 
Again, that doesn’t mean it can’t 
flare up in Alaska. It has flared up in 
other parts of our country. For exam-
ple, we have some 200 villages that are 
not connected by roads and many of 
which do not have healthcare facilities. 
If they do have them, they are very, 
very limited. These communities were 
hit very hard by the Spanish flu, so 
there is a lot of trepidation in rural 
Alaska. 
We have a fishing season that will 
start and will begin to bring people in 
from out of State—thousands of peo-
ple—to work in Alaska. This is very 
important for our economy, but the 
communities need to feel safe. I have 
raised this issue with the President, 
the Vice President, and the Chief of 
Staff, and to their credit they have re-
sponded. 
As a matter of fact, right now we 
have a doctor from DHS who is going 
around the State, with Dr. Zink and 
others, who was sent there by Admiral 
Brett Giroir, the HHS Assistant Sec-
retary, in charge of testing. They are

all out there. They are going to be in 
Kodiak, Bristol Bay, and Cordova, try-
ing to make sure that our fishing com-
munities are ready. 
When the admiral called me, he said: 
We are working with the State, Sen-
ator SULLIVAN. This direction is from 
the highest senior officials in the 
White House to get out there and bring 
resources to your fishing communities, 
and I will say, working with Dr. Zink, 
she is one of the top medical officers in 
the country. This is Admiral Giroir 
speaking about Dr. Zink. 
So as you can tell, the utmost dili-
gence is required and so is planning, 
communication, and bringing people 
along, particularly when you are ask-
ing them to take extreme measures. 
Again, because of the leadership we 
have, it is something that I think so 
far is going well in our State. 
Commissioner Crum said: 
Alaskans are contrarian by nature. They 
want to be educated. They don’t want to be 
forced. When they were told that it was the 
right thing to do, to comply with the man-
dates—that if we do this now, it will hurt 
less later—they did it. 
Alaskans 
did 
this. 
Commissioner 
Crum continued: 
It was the most painful thing I’ve ever 
done—asking people to close their busi-
nesses. But not as painful as it was for the 
people who actually had to shut down their 
business. But Alaskans complied and we 
worked together. 
True leaders emerge during times of 
crisis. We are grateful that these two 
leaders emerged for us in Alaska. They 
are working, along with the Governor 
and the rest of his team, to do a very 
good job for our State. 
Like I said, we aren’t past this. We 
have enormous challenges in our Na-
tion and huge economic challenges in 
our State, but we know a few things. 
We have good people at the top who are 
guiding us, and we know that Alaskans 
will do the right thing when they are 
asked by these people. We also know 
that we are resilient, our State, our 
people, and our Nation. 
In a recent interview, Dr. Zink said 
that one of her big takeaways through-
out this entire pandemic is just how 
important resilience is and how very 
resilient Alaska is. She said, ‘‘Adver-
sity can bring out the best and worst in 
people, and we have a choice to grow in 
response to the challenges or crumble 
from them.’’ 
Well, as I mentioned at the beginning 
of my remarks, I am convinced that 
Alaska will grow from these challenges 
and that America will grow from these 
challenges, and I am convinced that 
what we are seeing all around our 
State and our Nation is amazing gen-
erosity, 
people 
working 
together 
through these difficult times. We will 
emerge stronger and more resilient. 
So I want to thank two leaders in our 
State who are responsible, in many 
ways, for getting us through, so far so 
good, on the health side, Commissioner 
Crum and Dr. Zink. Thank you for your 
service. Thank you for your hard work 
and your sacrifice. Thank you for step-
ping up and congratulations on being 
our Alaskans of the Week. 
I yield the floor.

SERGEANT H.A. ‘‘BUCK’’ WENZEL 
TRIBUTE 
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 14, 2020 
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Sergeant Buck Wenzel of Custer 
County, Colorado for his valuable service as a 
law enforcement officer and community leader 
for over 40 years and to wish him well in his 
retirement. 
As a young adult, Buck served as a law en-
forcement officer with the Security Forces of 
the U.S. Air Force. Since 1977, Buck has 
served the Third Congressional District in var-
ious capacities as a community leader and law 
enforcement official at the Pueblo County 
Sheriff’s Office and the Custer County Sheriff’s 
Office. Buck graduated from the Colorado Law 
Enforcement Training Academy in November 
1978 and shortly thereafter served in a Patrol 
Division as a Patrol Deputy. 
He was transferred in 1981 to the Investiga-
tions Division, where as a Detective he spe-
cialized in violent crimes. A few years later, he 
was tasked with creating a Field Training and 
Evaluation Program for all new recruit patrol 
deputies. Later, Buck served as an Instructor 
at the Law Enforcement Academy and as a 
supervisor for SWAT. Because of his exem-
plary service, he was promoted in 1988 and 
sent to the Northwestern School of Police 
Staff and Command at Northwestern Univer-
sity in Chicago. He received the Kremling 
Honorable Mention upon graduation. 
In 2001, Buck was tasked with absorbing 
Colorado State University’s Police Department 
and establishing a contractual Sheriff’s Office 
Policing Division for the university. During his 
last 10 years of service at the Pueblo County 
Sheriff’s Office, he served as the Senior Oper-
ations Commander for the Operations Bureau 
partaking in duties such as daily and long-term 
planning of the Bureau and Divisions which in-
cluded Field Training, SWAT, and 9–1–1. Sev-
eral years later in 2007, Buck retired from the 
Pueblo County Sheriff’s Office. 
For his service, Buck has received innumer-
able awards and commendations including 
honorable mentions, sheriff commendations, 
and team commendations. Additionally, he re-
ceived the 2005 National Alliance on Mental 
Illness Heroes in the Fight Award, 2005 Pueb-
lo County Uniformed Officer of the Year 
Award, and 2014 Custer County Sheriff’s Of-
fice Officer of the Year Award. Now retired 
from law enforcement, Buck continues his 
work as Mayor of Silver Cliff and as a Chair-
person of the Custer County 9–1–1 Authority 
Board. 
Madam Speaker, Buck has dutifully served 
his country and community for almost his en-
tire life. He has more than earned his retire-
ment. I wish him the best of luck in this next 
stage of life and look forward to seeing his fu-
ture contributions to the community. 
RECOGNIZING AT&T CEO RANDALL 
L. STEPHENSON ON HIS RETIRE-
MENT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 14, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
AT&T CEO Randall L. Stephenson on his re-
tirement after an extraordinary career of serv-
ice. 
Mr. Stephenson began his career with 
Southwestern Bell Telephone in 1982 in Okla-
homa. He served as the company’s senior ex-
ecutive vice president and chief financial offi-
cer from 2001 to 2004, and from 2004 to 2007 
he was chief operating officer, after which he 
took over as chief executive officer. He was 
also appointed to AT&T’s board of directors in 
2005. 
Under Mr. Stephenson’s guide, AT&T has 
committed $550 million since 2008 to its sig-
nature philanthropic initiative, AT&T Aspire, 
which drives innovation in education to pro-
mote student success in school and the work-
place. He also led AT&T’s breakthrough ‘‘It 
Can Wait’’ campaign—an education and 
awareness program to reduce distracted driv-
ing. The program has amassed more than 40 
million pledges of support. Additionally, in 
2018, Warner Media unveiled an industry-first 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy for talent in front 
of and behind the camera. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Stephenson’s con-
tributions to the city of Dallas, state of Texas, 
these United States, and across the globe are 
truly immeasurable. Therefore, on behalf of 
the U.S. House of Representatives and Texas’ 
30th Congressional District, I ask that my col-
leagues join me in congratulating Mr. Stephen-
son for reaching this milestone and wish him 
a fruitful retirement.

HONORING FRANCIS M. HAGER 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 14, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor my friend and fellow veteran, Francis M. 
Hager, who recently passed away at the age 
of 87 in Columbus, Indiana. 
Early in his life, Frank chose a path of serv-
ice to our country by enlisting in the U.S. 
Army. After completing his service, he went on 
to pursue a career in engineering and worked 
at Cummins Engine Company for 35 years 
where he designed and patented several inno-
vations. 
Frank was a pillar of the Columbus commu-
nity and a faithful member of the St. Bar-
tholomew Church. He trained altar servers for 
over 50 years, sang in the choir, delivered 
communion to nursing homes, and was a wel-
coming face to all members of the parish. 
Frank valued spending time with his family 
and served as a role model for future genera-
tions through his civic leadership and commit-
ment to country. 
The Pence family is lucky to have consid-
ered Frank a close friend. He was a generous 
person who will be remembered fondly and 
greatly missed. 
May God rest his soul and bring comfort to 
his family and friends as we mourn his loss 
and celebrate Frank’s life here on earth.

RECOGNIZING SSG JOHN W. JONES 
(RET.) 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 14, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy of one 
of Arkansas’s great veterans—SSG John W. 
Jones (Ret.). 
John was born in 1918 and began his ca-
reer of service shortly after the start of World 
War II. Prior to being wounded in combat in 
1945 he served in the Army, Company G, 
184th infantry, and completed many cam-
paigns including Aleutian Islands, Eastern 
Mandates, and the battle of Okinawa. 
John 
received 
numerous 
medals 
and 
awards for his service, including the Philippine 
Liberation Ribbon with two Bronze Stars, the 
Army Good Conduct Medal, and a Purple 
Heart. 
After returning home he married and had 
four children. He learned the auto body trade 
and worked for Bale Chevrolet in Little Rock 
Arkansas for almost 30 years before retiring. 
John currently lives in Little Rock, Arkansas 
and is now a COVID–19 survivor. 
John is a true American patriot, one of 
which all Americans and Arkansans can ad-
mire.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CPL RORY 
PATRICK HAMILL 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 14, 2020 
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today be-
cause my community has lost a leader, a 
mentor, a friend, and a father. Corporal Rory 
Patrick Hamill of the United States Marine 
Corps tragically passed away on May 1, 2020 
at the age of 31. 
Rory leaves behind not just a legacy of 
decorated service to his country, but also of 
leadership, compassion and a commitment to 
helping those in need. Rory deployed three 
times with 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines in Iraq 
and Afghanistan before his medical retirement 
in 2012. During his time in service, Rory re-
ceived the Navy and Marine Corps Com-
mendation Medal with Combat ‘‘V’’ for val-
orous actions in direct contact with an enemy,

two Combat Action Ribbons as well as many 
other awards, medals, and citations. Rory was 
also awarded the Purple Heart by President 
Obama for the many injuries he sustained dur-
ing his deployments, including the loss of his 
right leg. 
Upon his retirement from the Marine Corps, 
Rory found his calling in learning about him-
self and Post Traumatic Growth, which led him 
to a career in motivational speaking. Rory also 
volunteered with the Veterans Diversion Pro-
gram at the Ocean County Prosecutors office 
where he acted as a mentor to veterans who 
had found themselves in the legal system as 
a result of their experiences while serving. 
Most recently, Rory was enrolled in an accel-
erated Masters Program in pursuit of a degree 
in Social Work at Monmouth University, where 
he worked to identify successful pathways for 
Post 9/11-era Veterans to reintegrate into their 
communities in New Jersey. 
Rory’s commitment to his community and to 
those struggling is best said in his own written 
words: ‘‘The more we share our pain, open up 
and discuss our mental health; the more 
power we take away from those same trau-
mas that affect us, and the more we can begin 
to heal. In sharing my story, I have found pur-
pose, catharsis, and humility. I have found my 
life’s purpose in helping those who suffer as I 
used to. . . .’’ ‘‘This is what I live for. Helping 
my fellow brothers and sisters, showing them 
that there is a way to overcome any obstacle 
in their path; whether during service, or after.’’ 
Rory’s impact on the veteran community 
was immeasurable, and his passing is a trag-
edy for our state and nation. It is now up to 
us to continue his legacy, to lift each other up 
and be there for those in our community that 
are struggling as Rory would have. My heart 
goes out to his family, his three children, and 
all of the friends who Rory touched through 
his work over the years. He will truly be 
missed. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MS. RUTH 
‘‘RUTHY’’ HEBARD 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 14, 2020 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, with great 
pleasure, I rise today in recognition of Ms. 
Ruth ‘‘Ruthy’’ Hebard and her recent draft to 
continue her basketball career at the profes-
sional level, in the Women’s National Basket-
ball Association (WNBA). On Friday, April 
17th, Ms. Hebard was drafted by the Chicago 
Sky as their eighth overall pick. 
Ms. Hebard played forward at West Valley 
High School in Fairbanks, Alaska where she 
was chosen twice as USA Today’s Alaska 
Player of the Year, an incredible accomplish-
ment. She led West Valley High to many state 
tournaments and when she graduated, be-
came the first player in their school history to 
have her jersey retired. 
After high school, Ms. Hebard went on to 
play at the collegiate level for the University of 
Oregon where, this year, she was selected for 
the First-team All-American. Ms. Hebard is the 
second unanimous all-American basketball 
player in program history. Throughout her col-
legiate career for the Oregon Ducks, Ms. 
Hebard played in 144 games, playing an aver-
age of 28.7 minutes per game, and scoring 
16.4 points per game. 
Additionally, Ms. Hebard has played on the 
U.S. National Team leading the team to many 
titles and awards. Madam Speaker, Ms. Ruthy 
Hebard is an inspiration to all Americans, es-
pecially young girls and all young people pur-
suing athletic success. I ask my fellow Mem-
bers to congratulate Ms. Ruthy Hebard in her 
incredible accomplishments and wish her well 
as she continues on to the Chicago Sky. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIVES OF 
CHERYL AND CORRINA THINN 
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 14, 2020 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the lives of Cheryl and Corrina 
Thinn, sisters and frontline workers who 
passed away in late April after battling the 
coronavirus. 
Both Cheryl and Corrina served their com-
munities for years, dedicating their lives to 
protecting the health and safety of the people 
on Navajo Nation, and selflessly continued 
their service on the frontlines of this ongoing 
public health crisis. 
Cheryl served as a Navajo Nation juvenile 
detention officer and a Navajo Nation Emer-
gency Medical Service member. She then 
went on to serve and care for her community 
through her work for the Tuba City Regional 
Health Care Corporation. She is survived by 
her son. 
Corrina protected her community for 11 
years as an officer with the Navajo Nation Po-
lice Department, eventually becoming a Senior 
Navajo Police Department Officer with the 
Tuba City District. She then earned a master’s 
degree in social work and worked tirelessly to 
better the lives of Arizonans, working for 
health centers throughout the Navajo Nation 
as well as tribes throughout Arizona. Corrina 
is survived by two sons, a grandson, and a 
granddaughter. 
My heart breaks for the loved ones of these 
devoted and compassionate frontline workers. 
Pat and I are keeping Cheryl and Corrina’s 
family, friends, and the entire Navajo Nation 
community in our thoughts as we continue to 
mourn their passing.
