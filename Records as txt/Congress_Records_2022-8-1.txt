RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

FLOODING IN KENTUCKY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Eastern Kentucky is reeling, reeling 
from some of the worst flooding in our 
State’s history. The area is still experi-
encing rainfall today. This horrible, 
tragic crisis is far from over. 
In Jackson, waters reached 43-1⁄2 feet 
high, breaking an 83-year-old record. 
Drone footage shows whole towns com-
pletely 
submerged. 
Roadways 
have 
turned into rivers. Rising waters have 
reached rooftops. Across more than a 
dozen counties, severe rainstorms have 
created crisis conditions. Water rose 
too quickly for many to react, with 
tragic consequences. 
The Governor has confirmed that, so 
far, 35 people have lost their lives amid 
flash floods, including children, and I 
think that number is likely to rise in 
the coming days. Even the families 
who were lucky enough to get out un-
scathed have lost homes, businesses, 
and heirlooms. In many communities, 
the waterlogged destruction is abso-
lute. 
Eastern Kentucky is well known for 
its steep hilltops, rolling forests, and 
deep hollers. Those features, which 
make the region one of the most 
unique in the country, also create com-
plications for emergency personnel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3794 
August 1, 2022 
Our heroic first responders, including 
the National Guard from Kentucky and 
surrounding States, are working over-
time to find and recover stranded resi-
dents. They have rescued more than 
1,400 individuals since floodwaters hit. 
Nearly half of the rescues were by air. 
Late last week, I joined with every 
member of Kentucky’s congressional 
delegation to support the Governor’s 
request to the President for a major 
disaster declaration to give our first 
responders 
Federal 
help. 
President 
Biden issued that declaration prompt-
ly, and resources are already flowing 
into the Commonwealth to assist local 
emergency personnel. The President 
called me the other day, as well as Sec-
retary Mayorkas and FEMA Director 
Criswell. We are deeply grateful to 
them all for their speedy action. 
Director Criswell traveled to Ken-
tucky last week and has been on the 
ground assisting with recovery efforts 
directly. My staff in Southeastern Ken-
tucky are in close touch with local offi-
cials in the area, providing all the help 
we can. I will visit the affected commu-
nities myself in the coming days to 
meet with constituents and offer sup-
port. 
Unthinkably painful stories continue 
to come to us out of Eastern Kentucky. 
However, we have also heard moving 
reminders of Kentuckians’ selflessness. 
Last December, the city of Mayfield, in 
the western part of Kentucky, was dev-
astated by tornadoes. The town lost its 
fire station in that storm. But despite 
their own challenges, last week, the 
Mayfield Fire Department filled an am-
bulance with equipment and rushed to 
Eastern Kentucky to aid relief efforts. 
They didn’t have to think twice before 
helping fellow Kentuckians. 
We saw generosity all across the af-
fected region. Residents with boats, jet 
skis, and kayaks put their own lives at 
risk to rescue their neighbors. Schools, 
churches, parks, and businesses opened 
their doors to displaced families. As 
one resident put it over the weekend, 
no matter what, Eastern Kentuckians 
‘‘help each other.’’ 
So I am monitoring the situation 
closely and doing all I can to assist. 
Kentucky leaders on both sides of the 
political aisle are working together to 
coordinate further Federal aid. I am 
thankful to everyone who sprang into 
action to help with the rescue efforts, 
whether they were professional first re-
sponders or just Good Samaritans. 
And I am thankful for the help our 
State has already received from FEMA. 
Their continued assistance will be vital 
for rebuilding in the months ahead. 
Eastern Kentucky has been devastated 
by these floods. Our recovery process 
will take months and, in some places, 
literally years. But I know we will 
bounce back. Kentucky has faced chal-
lenges before, and we always, always 
overcome. 
THE ECONOMY 
Madam President, now on a com-
pletely different matter, when it comes 
to our economy, American families do 
not trust this Democratic Party gov-
ernment one bit. Nearly 90 percent of 
Americans are feeling anxious about 
inflation. Twenty-eight percent ap-
prove of how President Biden is han-
dling it—just a 28 percent approval rat-
ing. Only 22 percent think things will 
get any better after another year on 
his watch. 
Americans’ distrust of Democrats 
stands to reason. A year and a half ago, 
every single Senate Democrat provided 
the deciding vote for a $1.9 trillion 
reckless spending spree that has caused 
the worst inflation in 40 years. 
The 
Democratic 
leader, 
Senator 
SCHUMER, said back then ‘‘I do not 
think the dangers of inflation, at least 
in the near term, are very real.’’ He 
went on to lead every single Democrat 
to cast the deciding vote for the party- 
line spending spree that has destroyed 
families’ purchasing power through in-
flation. Now, the very same people 
want to deal our economy another 
body blow on a party-line vote. The 
same Democrats who said that a $1.9 
trillion spending spree would not cause 
inflation are now saying—listen to 
this—it is a good idea to raise taxes, 
kill jobs, attack American energy, and 
hammer 
American 
manufacturing, 
all—all—in the middle of the apparent 
recession, which they have already cre-
ated. 
Everyone knows that raising taxes in 
a recession kills jobs, but that is pre-
cisely what Democrats are desperate to 
do. So here is what they are proposing: 
a huge new tax hike on American jobs, 
more than $300 billion in new taxes. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation says 
a whopping 50 percent of that burden 
would fall directly on our Nation’s 
manufacturing sector. 
So in the middle of a supply chain 
crisis, Democrats want huge, job-kill-
ing tax hikes that will disproportion-
ately crush American manufacturing 
and manufacturing jobs. Oh, and Demo-
crats also want a huge new tax hike on 
American natural gas. 
Natural gas is the single largest 
source of electricity generation in our 
entire country. A plurality of all the 
power in America comes from—you 
guessed it—natural gas. It is also how 
countless families heat their homes. 
And it is a linchpin of our domestic en-
ergy independence and our ability to 
export to our allies in Europe. 
But the Green New Deal Democrats 
are coming straight after American 
natural gas with huge new tax hikes. 
The result will be higher electricity 
bills, higher heating costs, less export-
ing to our European allies just as Putin 
is trying to cut them off, and 90,000 
workers in the oil and gas industry— 
listen to this—out of work, eliminating 
90,000 workers in the oil and gas indus-
try in the process. 
Democrats’ tax hikes on American 
energy don’t stop there. With gas 
prices still sky-high, our colleagues are 
also proposing to resurrect a defunct 
tax that would take direct aim at 
American oil refining, and they want it 
pegged to inflation so the tax hike will 
automatically climb up and up exactly 
when the country can least afford it. 
So on top of all this, the Democrats 
also want to pour new funding into the 
IRS so they can more easily come after 
small business. IRS agents get new 
cars and new computers; small busi-
nesses get more audits. Add it all up, 
these tax hikes and others, and Demo-
crats want to drop an anvil—an anvil— 
on our economy at the worst possible 
time. 
The nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Taxation has demonstrated the Demo-
crats’ plan would shatter—shatter— 
President Biden’s promise not to raise 
taxes on households earning less than 
$400,000. Households making less than 
half that amount—less than $200,000— 
would see a $16.7 billion tax hike in 
year 2023 alone. This is people making 
under $200,000 would see a $16.7 billion 
tax hike next year alone. Amazingly, 
the very lowest earning Americans who 
make less than $10,000 per year would 
see the largest percentage tax hike of 
any group in the entire bill. So it hits 
people who make below $10,000, on a 
percentage basis, harder than any 
other group in the entire bill. 
So Democrats are labeling all these 
tax hikes the ‘‘Inflation Reduction 
Act,’’ but nonpartisan experts have al-
ready proven that is flat-out false. The 
budget experts at Penn Wharton show 
this bill would slightly—slightly—in-
crease inflation in the near term and 
do nothing to meaningfully reduce it in 
the long term. So it is not about infla-
tion. 
When you raise taxes on something, 
you get less of it. That is the way it 
works. In the middle of a recession, 
Democrats want to raise taxes on 
American jobs. In the middle of an en-
ergy crisis, Democrats want to raise 
taxes on American energy. In the mid-
dle of a middle-class inflation crisis, 
Democrats want to raise taxes on 
households way, way below the Presi-
dent’s $400,000 threshold. 
All of this economic genius—all of 
this economic genius—is brought to 
you by the same people who called a 
$1.9 trillion inflation time bomb the 
‘‘American Rescue Plan’’ and promised 
it wouldn’t cause inflation right before 
it did. 
We know what it looks like when 
Democrats say they will help the econ-
omy, and American families can’t take 
much more of it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3795 
August 1, 2022 
very consequential week for this Cham-
ber and for our country. 
Later today, we will vote on the 
nomination of Elizabeth Hanes to serve 
as district judge for the Eastern Dis-
trict of Virginia. If confirmed, she will 
be the 75th judge this Senate majority 
has confirmed since the start of Presi-
dent Biden’s term. 
In the coming days, the Senate will 
also finish its work passing the PACT 
Act, the largest expansion of veteran 
healthcare benefits in decades and a 
piece of legislation that should sail 
through 
this 
Chamber 
with 
over-
whelming bipartisan support. 
Over the past few days, the Capitol 
steps have been the site of something 
we should never see in this country: 
dozens of veterans braving heat and 
heavy rain, protesting through the 
night, demanding that the Senate take 
action on their healthcare benefits. 
They are there right now as we speak. 
No veteran who has sacrificed for our 
country should ever have to resort to 
spending the night on the Capitol steps 
to secure their benefits, but sadly, in 
this case, they have. 
It is unfortunate that our Republican 
colleagues chose to block quick pas-
sage of this bill last week even though 
this is the exact same piece of legisla-
tion many of them supported in June, 
with one small technical fix. In the 
coming days, we are going to give Sen-
ate Republicans another chance to do 
the right thing, to work with us so we 
can send this bill to the President’s 
desk ASAP. 
Since 9/11, nearly 31⁄2 million veterans 
have been exposed to toxic burn pits in 
the line of duty, leading to complica-
tions like cancer, lung disease, and 
other illnesses, but instead of getting 
the care they need without delay, 
many veterans have had to hire law-
yers and jump through hoops. They 
have to sue the Veterans’ Administra-
tion to get the help they deserve and 
need, incurred as they served our coun-
try in dangerous places like Iraq and 
Vietnam. Is that incredible? They have 
wasted years fighting the VA just to 
get the care they need when they 
should have spent that time treating 
their illnesses. It is equally parts trag-
ic and infuriating. 
Our veterans have already given 
their all to defend our Nation from 
threats abroad. They shouldn’t have to 
fight a second war here at home just to 
get the healthcare benefits they right-
fully deserve. These brave Americans 
sacrificed everything. They risked life 
and limb. The very least we can do as 
a country is ensure they receive top 
care. 
I urge both sides to work together to 
quickly pass the PACT act so we can 
send it to the President’s desk ASAP. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022 
Now on the Inflation Reduction Act 
of 2022, this week, the Senate will take 
action on a groundbreaking piece of 
legislation, one that we haven’t seen in 
decades: the Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022. 
Over the coming days, both sides will 
continue conversations with the Par-
liamentarian in order to move forward 
the bipartisan Byrd bath process. Our 
timeline has not changed, and I expect 
to bring this legislation to the Senate 
floor and to begin voting this week. 
Already, leading experts have con-
firmed the Inflation Reduction Act 
lives up to its name. 
The Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget—by no means a liberal 
group—affirmed that ‘‘almost every 
one of [this bill’s] policies, in and of 
itself, will fight inflation. And on net, 
the entire package most certainly 
will.’’ That is the Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget, whom our 
Republican friends often quote. 
Former Treasury Secretary Larry 
Summers—recently 
the 
Republican 
leader’s favored economist—said, ‘‘This 
bill is fighting inflation’’ and that 
‘‘this is disinflationary policy that’s 
also going to make the economy more 
efficient.’’ 
Mark 
Zandi, 
chief 
economist 
at 
Moody’s—again, hardly a liberal au-
thority, someone who actually served 
as an economic adviser to Senator 
McCain—writes that our bill will have 
a ‘‘material economic impact’’ and said 
that the Inflation Reduction Act will 
‘‘push inflation lower.’’ That is Mark 
Zandi. 
In short, the Inflation Reduction Act 
is going to be just what the doctor or-
dered for bringing down costs for 
American families. We are excited and 
eager to pass this bill through the Sen-
ate as soon as we can. 
Of course, of huge significance—this 
is one of the things that make this bill 
so historic—by a significant margin, 
our bill will also be the largest package 
on climate change ever—ever—passed 
by this Congress. 
By our analysis, this bill will cut 
greenhouse gas emissions by approxi-
mately 40 percent by 2030—that is a 
lot—and independent studies corrobo-
rate this. 
According to a new study by the non-
partisan Energy Innovation group, the 
Inflation Reduction Act would not only 
create at least 1.5 million new jobs by 
2030, it also affirms that our bill will 
achieve 
approximately 
40 
percent 
greenhouse gas reduction by the end of 
the decade. 
Let me repeat that last part. This 
independent analysis says that our bill, 
if enacted, could cut greenhouse gasses 
by approximately 40 percent. That is 
the number we believe it does. That is 
a very, very, very big deal. 
But with this bill, we are going to 
put the country on track to meet the 
climate goals we need to preserve for 
our planet, for our children, and for our 
grandchildren. 
Now, cutting emissions is not just 
about protecting our planet’s health; it 
is also about protecting our kids’ 
health, too. 
If we slash emissions, that means 
cleaner air for everyone, which in turn 
means fewer people suffer health com-
plications that arise from pollution. It 
means less strain on our healthcare 
system. It means that communities— 
poorer communities, minority commu-
nities—long exposed to harmful emis-
sions can, quite literally, breathe easy 
at last. 
In fact, the same study from Energy 
Innovation found that our bill could 
avoid as many as 3,900 premature 
deaths and 100,000 asthma attacks an-
nually by 2030—3,900 fewer premature 
deaths, 100,000 fewer asthma attacks. 
These are benchmarks every single one 
of us should aspire to, regardless of 
party. Put simply, this legislation will 
save lives, create jobs, reduce costs, re-
duce inflation. 
Now, over the past few days, we have 
heard Republicans go back to their 
timeworn attacks that they use vir-
tually against any Democratic policy. 
They are sounding alarms that this bill 
will raise taxes on American families, 
but it does not. Here is the plain truth: 
The bill will not raise any taxes—any 
taxes—on 
families 
making 
under 
$400,000 a year. Instead, it will close 
loopholes long exploited by the largest 
corporations that essentially give them 
lower tax rates than many nurses, fire-
fighters, teachers. You won’t hear Re-
publicans admit that. Why? Because 
they know that their tax policies are 
utterly toxic in the minds of American 
people. 
When you increase taxes on the 
wealthiest and corporations who pay 
nothing, they say: You are raising 
taxes on everybody. Bull. They tried 
it in 2017. They went out there and said 
they had a massive tax reduction for 
the middle class. They called it a ‘‘mid-
dle class miracle,’’ even though they 
were just cutting taxes predominantly 
on the rich. I think it was like 70, 80 
percent. It was a boondoggle in favor of 
the rich. 
They promised their tax bill would 
unleash a tsunami of economic activ-
ity. Instead, it led to record corporate 
stock buybacks, benefiting the wealthy 
and nobody else. 
So when Republicans talk about cut-
ting taxes, what they really mean is 
cutting taxes for the richest of the 
rich. That is how their whole philos-
ophy is. That is the people who seem to 
control lots of the Republican party. 
Our bill, meanwhile, will close tax 
loopholes in our Tax Code and not 
touch anyone—anyone—making under 
$400,000 a year. That is common sense. 
At the end of the day, the American 
people want us to do a few straight-
forward things. They want us to lower 
the 
cost 
of 
daily 
expenses 
like 
healthcare and drugs. They want us to 
lower energy costs and protect our 
planet for future generations. And they 
want to make sure that everyone plays 
by the same rules and that we close 
loopholes long exploited by powerful 
corporations. 
That is what the Inflation Reduction 
Act will do, and soon, Democrats will 
take action to pass this bill and deliver 
on our promise to make better the 
lives of the American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3796 
August 1, 2022 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The Senator from Iowa. 
FBI INVESTIGATIONS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
we all know that Congress has a con-
stitutional responsibility to ensure 
that the executive branch executes the 
laws and uses taxpayers’ money appro-
priately in accordance with congres-
sional intent. It doesn’t matter wheth-
er we have a Republican President, a 
Democratic President, a Republican 
Senate, or a Democratic Senate. We all 
have the constitutional responsibility 
of checking the executive branch. 
In furtherance of that constitutional 
responsibility, Congress has an obliga-
tion 
to 
investigate 
the 
executive 
branch for fraud, for waste, for abuse, 
and even gross mismanagement. 
And 
if 
Congress 
finds 
potential 
wrongdoing, we have an obligation to 
the American people to make sure that 
it is public because transparency of the 
public’s business brings accountability 
to those who conduct that public busi-
ness. 
Last week, I made public two over-
sight letters that I have sent to the 
Justice Department and to the FBI. 
These two letters are part of my inves-
tigation into a political bias that is in-
fecting the Department of Justice and 
the FBI. 
These letters are based on informa-
tion provided to my office by whistle-
blowers, and I hope everybody knows 
that I consider whistleblowers as patri-
ots. And whistleblowers have to have 
guts, and they do have guts. 
And Director Wray has personally 
told me that these whistleblowers 
won’t be subject to retaliation, as 
often, whistleblowers in the Federal 
Government are subject to retaliation, 
hurting themselves professionally and 
maybe even losing their jobs. 
Now, these letters that I sent follow 
up on a May 31, 2022, letter to the Jus-
tice Department, the FBI, and the in-
spector general. 
In those letters, I provided evidence 
of extreme leftwing bias shown by a 
special agent in charge by the name of 
Tim Thibault. He is special agent in 
charge of the FBI’s Washington field 
office. 
Now, he has since been referred to 
the Office of Special Counsel for poten-
tial Hatch Act violations. Thibault is 
at the center of my two letters sent 
last week. The first letter relates to an 
FBI investigation that Thibault opened 
on the Trump campaign and its advis-
ers. He allegedly had help from Richard 
Pilger, an official in the Justice De-
partment’s 
Election 
Crime 
Branch 
within the Public Integrity Section. 
During Chairman DURBIN’s investiga-
tion into the Justice Department mis-
conduct, Pilger really stood out. 
The committee interviewed Richard 
Donoghue, the former Principal Asso-
ciate Deputy Attorney General during 
the Trump administration. He was also 
a key January 6 Committee witness. 
Donoghue testified to the Judiciary 
Committee that Pilger’s conduct frus-
trated the Department’s ability to 
properly operate the Elections Crime 
Branch. 
Thibault and Pilger played a major 
role in opening the criminal investiga-
tion into the Trump campaign. And 
this isn’t a preliminary investigation; 
it is a full investigation, which re-
quires heightened standards to go for-
ward with that investigation. 
According to the whistleblowers that 
contacted my office, the opening memo 
for that investigation is based, in sub-
stantial part, on liberal news report-
ing. Liberal news reports are not 
enough for a full investigation. The 
Washington Post reported on the inves-
tigation last Tuesday. However, the 
Post did not report that Thibault and 
Pilger were involved in opening that 
case against Trump and his advisers. 
Yet Attorney General Garland and Di-
rector Wray allegedly approved open-
ing those investigations. 
Now, as I have said in my letter to 
those two people, if you are going to 
open an investigation, you have to do 
it in the right way. 
So let’s contrast this investigation 
with what the FBI has done with the 
information received from sources re-
lating to Hunter Biden. Whistleblowers 
have told my office that the FBI main-
tains many sources that have provided 
extensive 
information 
on 
Hunter 
Biden. That information allegedly in-
volves 
potential 
criminal 
activity, 
such as money laundering. That is the 
same criminal concern that Senator 
JOHNSON and I raised in our 2020 Biden 
report. To clarify, that was way back 
in 2020. According to the whistle-
blowers’ allegations, the underlying in-
formation 
was 
verified 
and 
was 
verifiable. 
Now, here is where it is appropriate 
to raise questions about politics and 
political interference in investigations. 
However, instead of green-lighting the 
investigative activity, the FBI shut 
down the Hunter investigation. 
So, now, how did they do that? Ac-
cording to allegations, in August 2020, 
FBI Supervisory Intelligence Analyst 
Brian Auten opened an assessment. 
That assessment was used by the FBI 
officials to improperly discredit Hunter 
Biden’s information as you know what? 
Disinformation. Those officials alleg-
edly included Thibault. 
Then, in October 2020, an avenue of 
additional Hunter reporting was or-
dered closed at the direction of Special 
Agent Thibault. It has been alleged 
that Thibault and others suggested to 
FBI agents that the information was at 
risk 
of 
being 
you 
know 
what? 
Disinformation. However, according to 
allegations, the source reporting was 
either verified or verifiable via crimi-
nal search warrants. 
Thibault allegedly ordered the mat-
ter closed without providing a valid 
reason as required by FBI guidelines. 
In other words, Thibault shut down an 
allegedly legitimate avenue of informa-
tion. So in order to shut down Hunter 
Biden sources and investigative leads, 
the FBI engaged in a disinformation 
campaign against itself and its own 
agents. If these allegations are true 
and accurate, the Justice Department 
and the FBI are and have been substan-
tially corrupted. 
Before I conclude, I want to know 
four things regarding the summer of 
2020. Yes, the summer of 2020: The 
opening of Auten’s assessment in Au-
gust 2020; secondly, efforts by the FBI 
officials to shut down Hunter Biden’s 
investigative activity; third, efforts by 
the FBI to provide a really unnecessary 
briefing to me and Senator JOHNSON in 
August of 2020—that reading was pur-
portedly about our Biden investigation, 
but it had nothing to do with the Biden 
investigation—fourth, and lastly, leaks 
relating to the briefing and the liberal 
media and Democrats falsely accusing 
me and Senator JOHNSON of advancing 
Russian information. 
All of those four data points hap-
pened as Senator JOHNSON and I pre-
pared to finalize our September 2020 
Biden report. These data points show a 
plan was in place at the FBI to under-
mine 
anything 
related 
to 
Hunter 
Biden. 
Attorney General Garland and Direc-
tor Wray, you both have an obligation 
to the country to immediately inves-
tigate these allegations and to clean 
house. 
And my oversight work on this and 
related matters will certainly con-
tinue. 
INSPECTORS GENERAL 
Madam President, on another point 
and a much shorter point, just in case 
some of my colleagues are wondering 
how long I am going to have the floor— 
today, I come to speak on the impor-
tance of inspector generals, IGs, as 
they are called in this town. 
IGs 
play 
an 
important 
role 
watchdogging executive branch Agen-
cies. They help make sure that govern-
ment bureaucrats are held accountable 
when they engage in waste, fraud, and 
abuse of taxpayers’ money. 
IGs are force multipliers for Congress 
in overseeing our responsibility of 
checks and balances of the executive 
branch 
of 
government. 
They 
are 
charged with keeping Congress in-
formed of wrongdoing and to provide 
objective, 
nonpartisan 
recommenda-
tions on even the most politically sen-
sitive issues. 
As of today, there are currently 13 IG 
vacancies throughout the Federal Gov-
ernment. Some have nominees; some 
don’t have nominees; and some haven’t 
had Senate-confirmed IGs in years. 
Now, to hone in on one vacancy that 
I paid special attention to over the 
years is that of the Department of De-
fense inspector general. Believe it or 
not, that office has not had a Senate- 
confirmed IG in more than 6 years. The 
Department of Defense has an annual 
budget of well over $700 billion, and to 
date it looks like they will have much 
more money the next fiscal year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3797 
August 1, 2022 
Now, I have spent many years calling 
out waste, fraud, and abuse of tax-
payers’ money at the Department of 
Defense, and I know full well the im-
portance of having a Senate-confirmed 
IG in place at that very important De-
partment. Having an independent and 
effective watchdog at this point is crit-
ical to keep the Congress informed of 
all the tomfoolery that happens at the 
Pentagon. Whether that be paying ex-
orbitant amounts of money for a ham-
mer, constructing buildings in foreign 
countries that remain vacant to this 
day, or failing to hold contractors ac-
countable, it all happens time and time 
again. 
We in Congress need a watchdog with 
teeth, not afraid to fight off the cor-
porate fat cats who seek to enrich 
themselves off the backs of the Amer-
ican taxpayers. Some of these contrac-
tors have made careers from ripping off 
the taxpayers through wasteful spend-
ing at the Department of Defense. A 
few thousand dollars here, a couple 
million there, it turns out to be waste 
many times. 
We need a watchdog—an inspector 
general—at this post, and we need it 
now. I believe my colleagues here in 
the Senate share my belief in the im-
portance of having Senate-confirmed 
IGs in these vital roles. The President 
must act to nominate, and the Senate 
should confirm qualified and effective 
watchdogs to the vacancies like this, 
particularly the one at the Department 
of Defense. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, Joe Biden and the Democrats 
have ushered us into what will be re-
membered as one of the most cynical 
and dangerous periods in our Nation’s 
history. For 18 months, they have 
wreaked havoc on the economy, wel-
comed drugs and crime into their own 
backyards, and enabled the rise of the 
new axis of evil, which is my term for 
Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. 
Last week was really a particularly 
bad week for the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration, but it was even worse for the 
people watching it play out, sitting at 
home in their communities. Inflation 
hit a 41-year high, consumer confidence 
hit a historic low, and we confirmed 
that the American economy is indeed 
in a recession. 
But rather than taking responsi-
bility, my Democratic friends decided 
they would go on an all-out campaign 
and redefine the word ‘‘recession,’’ and 
they insisted that the economic ruin 
that they have rained down on us all is 
in our imaginations. The economy is in 
great shape, they say. It is better than 
ever, they say. But Tennesseans sitting 
at their kitchen table, trying to figure 
out how to make ends meet, they know 
different. 
If ever there were a time to listen to 
what the American people are telling 
each and every one of us, it is now. Yet 
here we are facing now what is possibly 
the Democratic Party’s most cynical 
and dangerous move to date: a trillion- 
plus—a 
trillion-plus-dollar 
spending 
spree. It is full of tax increases and 
policies so unpopular that its nego-
tiators had to hide its existence from 
our own colleagues. 
CHUCK
SCHUMER
and JOE
MANCHIN 
have dubbed this secret plan—I guess is 
what it was—they have dubbed it the 
Inflation Reduction Act, which imme-
diately brings to mind one simple ques-
tion: How out of step can you possibly 
be with where the American people 
are? You are so out of step. And do you 
truly think that the American people 
are so stupid that they think raising 
taxes is going to bring a reduction in 
inflation? 
If the situation weren’t so dire for 
people back in Tennessee, I would as-
sume this was some sort of joke, but it 
is not. The American people are drown-
ing, and CHUCK
SCHUMER
and JOE 
MANCHIN have thrown them a cinder 
block instead of a life preserver. People 
cannot believe this. They absolutely 
cannot believe this. 
This bill represents the worst ele-
ments of a radical socialist agenda that 
Americans have already rejected: a 
multihundred-billion-dollar tax hike 
that will kill tens of thousands of jobs, 
sabotage energy producers, and make 
it even more expensive to heat homes 
and fill gas tanks; a multihundred-bil-
lion-dollar payday for climate activists 
and the environmental lobby; innova-
tion-killing price controls on prescrip-
tion drugs; and tax breaks, but only for 
the wealthiest Americans. 
Nothing in this bill will make life 
easier. Nothing in this bill will lower 
gas prices or reduce inflation. But it is 
exactly what Tennesseans were afraid 
would happen if Joe Biden and the 
Democrats took control of the Federal 
Government. 
This week, every Member of this 
body has a choice to make: Will you 
stand with the American people, or will 
you make their life harder every day 
because of more spending, more tax in-
creases, and more Green New Deal? 
Will you ease their pain, or will you 
make their pain worse by supporting 
this bloated, foolish spending spree? 
I hope that my colleagues will come 
to their senses because this is a break-
ing point between Congress and the 
American people. 
I cannot tell you how many times I 
heard that very statement this week-
end from Tennesseans. They cannot 
even believe another trillion dollars in 
spending—another trillion. Money does 
not grow on trees. 
If you, as an individual who has a 
vote on this bill, if you choose to sup-
port this bill and tax and spend this 
country into oblivion, that is a road 
that you are going to have to go down 
alone because the American people 
cannot afford to go down this road with 
you. 
PACT ACT OF 2022 
Madam President, the Democratic 
press machine has done a great job 
framing the debate over much needed 
changes to the PACT Act as an attack 
on our most vulnerable veterans. This 
framing ignores reality. 
I supported the PACT Act. I voted for 
final passage last time around. I have 
worked for years on the issue of toxic 
exposure. I intend to vote for the bill 
again, so do many of my colleagues 
who have joined me in still pushing for 
critical improvements to this bill. 
Before we vote on final passage this 
week, I would ask my colleagues one 
question: Why wait to fix the problems 
we all know will hamper the effective-
ness of this bill? Why not fix the PACT 
Act now and ensure that veterans actu-
ally have access to the care they de-
serve once this bill leaves the Presi-
dent’s desk with his signature? That is 
the real choice here. 
Now, I know my Democratic col-
leagues are on a tight timeline. They 
want this thing done. They want it 
done before the elections. They want 
this signed. They want to get out there 
and campaign on this. They want us 
just to move on and not have to fix it 
until later. 
But it is not my job to make CHUCK 
SCHUMER’s life easier or those running 
for election, to make their lives easier. 
It is my job to be certain that I rep-
resent these veterans in Tennessee who 
have given their commitment to defend 
this Nation. They have done it honor-
ably. They have done it expecting care 
from the VA for harms that have come 
their way. And we should make certain 
that they have access to the care that 
they need. 
The PACT Act in its current form is 
not the best that we can do, but we can 
get it there in a few more hours with a 
few amendments that would make sure 
this bill can help veterans suffering 
from the effects of toxic exposure and 
help them get the care that they de-
serve. 
And I want to make it clear that 
Senator 
SCHUMER
and 
Chairman 
TESTER know this. The majority of my 
colleagues who sit with me on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee support a 
vote on these amendments, so much so 
that, at one point, we had all agreed to 
give these amendments a vote because 
we all know that the VA is not capable 
of implementing this bill as it is cur-
rently written. 
The VA cannot deliver on the prom-
ise that is in this bill. In fact, it will do 
the exact opposite. Right now, the 
claims backlog at the VA sits at 168,000 
cases. You heard me right on that— 
168,000 cases. That is the current back-
log. 
The PACT Act, as written, will in-
crease that backlog by more than—get 
this—1 million cases—1 million. That is 
not according to me. That is according

S3798 
August 1, 2022 
to the Biden-nominated, Senate-con-
firmed 
VA 
Secretary 
Denis 
McDonough. 
Here is what he told us in testimony 
delivered to the committee on March 
29, 2022: 
Estimates from VA’s initial technical as-
sistance . . . demonstrated a potential back-
log increase to 1.5 . . . million claims by the 
end of fiscal year . . . 2023. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent 
to 
have 
Secretary 
McDonough’s testimony printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
TITLE II: TOXIC EXPOSURE PRESUMPTION 
PROCESS 
SUMMARY 
Title II, called the Fairly Assessing Serv-
ice-related Toxic Exposure Residuals Pre-
sumptions Act, or the FASTER Presump-
tions Act, would create new provisions in 
chapter 11 of title 38, U.S.C., regarding deter-
minations relating to presumptions of serv-
ice connection based on toxic exposure. 
The new 38 U.S.C. § 1171 would establish the 
process by which VA could establish or mod-
ify presumptions of service connection based 
on toxic exposures. 
The new 38 U.S.C. § 1172 would establish a 
Formal Advisory Committee on Toxic Expo-
sure. 
VA could consult with, and seek the advice 
of, the Committee with respect to cases in 
which Veterans are suspected of having expe-
rienced a toxic exposure during active serv-
ice or dependents of such Veterans. 
The Committee would have to assess cases 
of toxic exposures of Veterans and their de-
pendents by conducting ongoing surveillance 
and reviewing scientific literature, media re-
ports, information from Veterans and infor-
mation from Congress. These assessments 
would cover suspected and known toxic expo-
sures. 
The Committee also would be responsible 
for periodically assessing the accuracy of the 
Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record 
(ILER) and the data collected. 
The Committee could develop a rec-
ommendation for formal evaluation under 
the new 38 U.S.C. § 1173 to conduct a review 
of the health effects related to an exposure if 
the Committee determines that the research 
may change the current understanding of the 
relationship between an exposure to an envi-
ronmental hazard and adverse health out-
comes in humans. Based upon evidence re-
garding the periods and locations of exposure 
covered by an existing presumption, the 
Committee could nominate for formal eval-
uation under new 38 U.S.C. § 1173 modifica-
tions of the periods and locations for eligi-
bility for benefits. 
The new 38 U.S.C. § 1173 would require VA 
to establish a process to conduct a formal 
evaluation for each recommendation of the 
Committee established under proposed § 1172. 
Under this process, VA would have to con-
duct research regarding the health effects re-
lated to a case of toxic exposure or to evalu-
ate evidence regarding the periods and loca-
tions of exposure covered by an existing pre-
sumption of service connection. 
Each formal evaluation would have to 
cover scientific evidence, claims data and 
other factors as VA determined appropriate. 
The formal evaluations would have to 
evaluate the likelihood that a positive asso-
ciation existed between an illness and a toxic 
exposure while serving in active service and 
assess toxic exposures and illnesses to deter-
mine whether the evidence supported a find-
ing of a positive association between the 
toxic exposure and the illness. 
Not later than 120 days after a formal eval-
uation is commenced, the element of VA 
that conducts the evaluation would have to 
submit to the Secretary a recommendation 
with respect to establishing a presumption of 
service connection for the toxic exposure and 
illness, or modifying an existing presump-
tion of service connection, covered by the 
evaluation. 
The new 38 U.S.C. § 1174 would require VA 
to commence issuing regulations if the Sec-
retary determines, based on a recommenda-
tion under § 1173, that the presumption or 
modification is warranted or to notify the 
public that the presumption or modification 
is not warranted. If VA removed a presump-
tion, Veterans and other beneficiaries who 
were receiving benefits based on that pre-
sumption would continue to receive such 
benefits. 
The new 38 U.S.C. § 1175 would allow VA to 
modify the process under which it conducts 
formal evaluations under § 1173 and issues 
regulations under § 1174. 
VA would have to ensure the new evalua-
tions cover the evidence, data and factors re-
quired by § 1173(b). 
VA would have to notify Congress and wait 
180 days before implementing such changes. 
VA also would have to seek to enter into 
an agreement with a nongovernmental enti-
ty or a Federally funded research and devel-
opment center to conduct a review of the im-
plementation of this subchapter. 
The new 38 U.S.C. § 1167 would require VA, 
whenever a law, regulation or Federal court 
decision established or modified a presump-
tion of service connection, to identify all 
previously denied claims that were sub-
mitted to VA that might have been decided 
differently had the presumption been in ef-
fect at the time of the application. 
VA would have to allow for the re-evalua-
tion of such claims at the election of the 
Veteran. 
Notwithstanding 38 U.S.C. § 5110, VA would 
have to provide compensation with respect 
to claims approved pursuant to such reevalu-
ation based on the date of the submission of 
the original claim. 
VA also would have to conduct outreach to 
inform relevant Veterans they may elect to 
have a claim re-evaluated under this author-
ity. 
This section would apply to presumptions 
of service-connection established or modified 
on or after the date of enactment. 
Title II also would amend 38 U.S.C. § 1116 to 
require VA to ensure that any determination 
made on or after the date of enactment re-
garding a presumption of service connection 
based on exposure to an herbicide agent 
under this section would be made pursuant 
to the new authorities described previously. 
In addition, title II would require VA to 
submit to Congress: 
Not less frequently than annually, a pub-
licly available report on recommendations 
for research and any recommendations for 
legislative or administrative action from the 
Committee 
established 
under 
§ 1172; 
VA 
would have to submit a publicly available re-
port on the findings and opinions of VA with 
respect to the Committee’s report. 
Within 2 years of enactment, a report on 
the implementation of, and recommenda-
tions for, the new §§ 1171–1175. On a quarterly 
basis during the 2-year period beginning on 
the date of enactment, VA would have to 
provide to Congress a briefing on the imple-
mentation of these provisions. 
Within 540 days of enactment, a report con-
taining the review by the nongovernmental 
entity or Federally funded research and de-
velopment center on the implementation of 
the new §§ 1171–1175. 
IMPACT ON CARE AND BENEFITS 
As the President said in the State of the 
Union earlier this month, VA already is pio-
neering new ways of linking toxic exposures 
to diseases, thus helping more Veterans re-
ceive their benefits. Based on a focused re-
view of scientific and medical evidence re-
lated to exposure to fine particulate matter 
and the subsequent development of rare res-
piratory cancers, VA recently announced its 
intention to initiate rulemaking that would 
consider adding presumptions of service con-
nection for several rare respiratory cancers 
for certain Veterans. This announcement fol-
lows VA’s rulemaking action last year estab-
lishing a presumption of service connection 
for three chronic respiratory conditions, in-
cluding asthma, rhinitis and sinusitis. 
We appreciate that the bill, as passed, in-
cludes changes made in collaboration be-
tween VA and the House Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. For example, removal of the 
Science Review Board and Working Group on 
presumptions of service connection would 
allow VA to implement an efficient, science- 
driven process. We are concerned, though, 
that the creation of a new Committee, par-
ticularly one subject to the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act, would likely slow existing 
mechanisms for proposing and conducting re-
search. 
Rather than using an advisory committee 
that would create significant administrative 
burdens and slow down the presumptive deci-
sion-making process, we recommend Con-
gress consider requiring VA to publish in the 
Federal Register an annual list of conditions 
the Department plans to evaluate under 
VA’s presumptive decision model, explain 
why the conditions were chosen for evalua-
tion and seek input from the public on that 
list. This approach would enable trans-
parency, intentionality and allow for public 
participation. It also would allow for a 
timelier decision-making process. We further 
recommend that Congress establish clear ef-
fective dates indicating when the proposed 
changes would take effect. VA recommends 
that sufficient time be given to allow it to 
implement this authority based on a variety 
of factors, including the regulatory develop-
ment and public comment process, as well as 
the significant implementation requirements 
and dependencies (such as staffing and re-
sources) associated with the bill as a whole. 
We also are concerned that the current bill 
text is ambiguous, notwithstanding the four 
‘‘strength of evidence’’ categories listed in 
proposed § 1173, as to when a presumption is 
warranted. It remains unclear whether Con-
gress intends for the Secretary to adopt the 
recommendations from the bill’s proposed 
process as a matter of course. If Congress in-
tends to allow VA to determine the applica-
ble standards for creating a presumption, it 
would be helpful to make that clear and to 
provide specific guidelines for when VA must 
create or modify these presumptions. For ex-
ample, if the strength of evidence for a par-
ticular condition falls in the category of ‘‘eq-
uipoise and above,’’ it is unclear whether the 
Secretary would be required to establish a 
presumption or if the Secretary would have 
discretion in those instances. If Congress in-
tends any specific, triggering standards gov-
erning these determinations, it would be 
helpful to clarify such standards in the bill. 
The court orders in the long-standing, com-
plex class action litigation in Nehmer v. U.S. 
Dep’t of Veterans Affairs (Nehmer) were 
based on a finding that, in creating presump-
tions based on herbicide agent exposure, VA 
applied standards inconsistent with Congres-
sional intent. It would be helpful for the 
Committee to clarify Congressional intent 
on this point to avoid similar consequences 
with respect to this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3799 
August 1, 2022 
The new § 1167 would impose a Nehmer-type 
effective date mechanism for new presump-
tions. We want to be clear to the Committee, 
though, that applying a Nehmer-like retro-
active effective date provision in this in-
stance would create a significant exception 
to the legal structure governing Veterans’ 
benefits. Applying this standard makes it 
difficult to predict the consequences of this 
type of effective date provision. VA would be 
required to apply the provision in this new 
authority not only to the presumptions cre-
ated in this bill but also to any future pre-
sumptions created by regulation, statute or 
court order. This requirement would present 
extraordinary workload challenges to the 
agency and unprecedented delays in the de-
livery of benefits to Veterans. For example, 
every previously denied claim for any of the 
presumptive conditions identified in or con-
templated by this bill (out of the nearly 3.5 
million Gulf War-deployed Veterans) would 
now be subject to a retroactive effective date 
as far back as 1991 for Gulf War I Veterans 
and 2001 for Global War on Terrorism Vet-
erans. 
We would welcome the opportunity to 
work with Congress to ensure that new au-
thorities in this area support our ongoing 
work to help us make informed decisions as 
quickly as possible. 
COSTS AND RESOURCES 
VA is concerned that an extremely large 
and unprecedented disability claims backlog 
would be created if the Nehmer-like provi-
sions in this bill are retained. Based on VA’s 
previous experience in implementing similar 
retroactive effective date provisions, we un-
derstand this provision would result in com-
plex and time-intensive claims processing 
procedures. In this case, claims processors 
would be required to review 20 to 30 years of 
evidence for a single issue. Considering that 
more than 1.9 million Gulf War-era deployed 
Veterans have filed disability claims in the 
past 30 years (over 900,000 of whom filed 
claims for respiratory issues), VA is very 
concerned about the impact of this provi-
sion. VA claims processors would be required 
to re-adjudicate hundreds of thousands of 
previously denied claims for earlier effective 
dates. Estimates from VA’s initial technical 
assistance, without this provision, dem-
onstrated a potential backlog increase to 1.5 
and 1.8 million claims by the end of fiscal 
year (FY) 2023. Any further application of 
retroactive presumptions would drive further 
benefit delivery delays for all Veterans. 
RESEARCH 
Title II would establish a new Committee 
and institute new processes related to the 
identification of and support for research re-
lated to toxic exposures. As noted pre-
viously, we are concerned some of the spe-
cific provisions in this title would prove 
more onerous and less nimble than our cur-
rent approach. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Now, the reason I 
have paid so much attention to this 
backlog is because every single week 
the team that works with me in Ten-
nessee handling these issues with our 
VSOs—our veterans service officers— 
keeps track of what we hear from the 
veterans. 
Right now in Tennessee, I have vet-
erans telling me they are waiting al-
most 100 days for a primary care ap-
pointment at the VA. Now, for many 
vets, this is just step 1. So once they 
contact the VA, it is 100 days. Think 
about that: 100 days before they get 
that primary care appointment, and 
that is if the appointment doesn’t get 
canceled or it has to be rescheduled. So 
that is an average to get to step 1— 
first step. 
Across Tennessee, veterans are wait-
ing yet another 39 days to get mental 
healthcare. Now, if they are needing 
dental appointments, dental surgery, 
or dental care, that is 44 days. If they 
go for that primary care appointment 
and they need to go see a cardiologist, 
that is 33 days; 28 days to see a gyne-
cologist; 30 days to go talk to someone 
about chronic pain. 
Look at what is happening. The VA 
cannot meet the load in front of them. 
Our veterans—our veterans who have 
defended our Nation’s freedom—cannot 
get the care they need in a timely man-
ner. 
Now, we have done a lot of work over 
the years to help the VA help itself. We 
have given them support for hiring. We 
have given them support for retention. 
But, Madam President, it takes 90 days 
for this Agency, the VA, to hire one 
person—90 days. And think of the num-
ber of caseworkers they would have to 
hire 
to 
implement 
this. 
Throwing 
money at the problem isn’t going to 
make these wait times and backlogs 
disappear. 
It is imperative that we fix the PACT 
Act so it is not a false promise, so it is 
not false hope. If the PACT Act is 
going to work for our veterans, then 
the VA needs to embrace community 
care. 
I proposed an amendment to the bill 
that would have eliminated arbitrary 
bureaucratic hurdles for toxic-exposed 
veterans who will inevitably face these 
long wait times. It would allow them 
to seek care in the community right 
there where they live if they could get 
it faster than they could from the VA. 
I offered this amendment based on 
my conversations with Tennessee vet-
erans who are chronically ill but can-
not get in to the VA to see a doctor and 
get that primary care appointment so 
they can move on to specialty care. 
Many of them are deteriorating at an 
alarming rate, and they deserve access 
to care as soon as they can get it. The 
only way that access to care for them 
is going to happen is if we allow them 
community care. They have fought for 
this country. They deserve to have ac-
cess to that care, but right now, they 
cannot get it. 
Madam President, I know you more 
than most understand how imperative 
it is for veterans to have access to the 
care they need, that this government 
make good on its promise to our vet-
erans, that we stop these long wait 
times, that we stop the delays, and 
that we allow them that access that 
they have earned and that they de-
serve. 
There is a way to fix this bill. I know 
there are some who say: Well, we are 
afraid this will privatize the VA. That 
is their fear, and I understand that. 
But at some point, veterans want us to 
take that action to put them first—not 
the bureaucracy first, put the veterans 
first—allow the veterans to make that 
choice if they cannot get to the VA in 
a timely manner. If the VA can’t get 
them in for an appointment, let’s open 
this up and let the veterans out into 
community care so their needs can be 
met in a timely manner. 
A promise in a piece of legislation 
ought not to end up as a false hope 
when it comes to our Nation’s vet-
erans. The best way we can fulfill our 
promise to toxic-exposed veterans is to 
give this bill the time it needs for an 
amendment that will allow our vet-
erans to access the care they need 
without having to wait on the VA to 
figure out how to implement this bill. 
Surely, surely, we can do this. Let’s 
have a vote on these amendments and 
fix this bill before it is signed into law. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
KOREAN WAR VETERANS MEMORIAL 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to talk briefly about a very sa-
cred place on our Nation’s Mall, The 
National Mall, that I had an oppor-
tunity to visit yesterday. It is the Ko-
rean War Veterans Memorial that mil-
lions and millions of Americans have 
visited. 
Something 
happened 
last 
Wednesday that I wanted to talk about 
a little bit, a really important rededi-
cation of this very moving war memo-
rial. 
Now, I like to get out on The Mall 
most days, go for a run in the morning 
when I am in DC, and I love our memo-
rials, like everybody in America does, 
particularly the memorials that are 
dedications to the service of our mili-
tary members, our veterans. The Pre-
siding Officer is a veteran, a war hero. 
I have a ton of respect for her and her 
service. But whether it is the World 
War II or the Vietnam Memorial, one 
of the most moving memorials that I 
like to visit is the Korean War Vet-
erans Memorial. Why? Well, I think 
there is so much we can all learn from 
the Korean war. 
In the Marine Corps, they really drill 
into you what happened during the Ko-
rean war. Unfortunately, not enough 
Americans know about the Korean war. 
But one of the big lessons is, you need 
to be ready. You need to be ready. 
In 1945, the U.S. military was the 
most fearsome military in the world, 
probably in the history of the world, 
and in 1950, just 5 years later, we had a 
very difficult time stopping a third 
world army in the opening months of 
the Korean war. Now, we rebounded, as 
Americans always do, but that is a les-
son. That is a lesson for our country. In 
my view, the uniformed civilian leader-
ship of our military did not serve their 
country well, letting the state of our 
forces become very unready. That is

one of the lessons of that very difficult, 
brutal war. 
There is another lesson, and it is the 
nobility of service from our veterans 
that really is epitomized by service in 
the Korean war. The memorial has 
many beautifully engraved sayings, but 
one, when you think about it, is so 
moving and, in my view, depicts the 
nobility of American military service, 
particularly as it relates to that war. 
It says: 
Our nation honors her sons and daughters 
who answered the call to defend a country 
they never knew and a people they never 
met. 
Think about that—young men and 
women in America sent to fight half-
way around the world to defend free-
dom. That is exactly what they were 
doing. And they didn’t even know 
whom they were defending. A lot of 
them didn’t even know where they 
were. 
To me, those words capture the es-
sence of nobility, and so does the Ko-
rean War Memorial. You see part of it 
here. The centerpiece is nine large 
statues—soldiers, sailors, airmen, ma-
rines. They are grunts, infantry grunts 
on patrol. You can see there is a cold, 
wet wind whipping their ponchos. Their 
faces are full of fear, when you look at 
the statues, but also pride and deter-
mination. And all of this, in my view, 
captures the nobility of our service and 
our sacrifice as a nation in this war. 
Now, historians have referred to the 
Korean war as the ‘‘forgotten war.’’ I 
am kind of a Korean war history buff. 
I really, really dislike that term. I 
think we should just get rid of it. It is 
kind of a pejorative term in some ways. 
I have always thought it downplays the 
sacrifice and nobility and meaning of 
this very brutal conflict. 
I have often thought and said that, 
instead of the forgotten war, we should 
call it the noble war because it was a 
noble undertaking. It was a noble un-
dertaking. Anyone who knows the his-
tory of this war or visits the memorial 
or knows a Korean war veteran or their 
family members knows that this was a 
noble undertaking by our great Nation, 
saving a country—literally saving a 
country—and we sacrificed a lot for it. 
That is the other thing that I think 
is very powerful on this memorial. 
Take a look at it—another depiction. 
You have heard it many times, but it is 
right there: ‘‘Freedom is not free.’’ 
‘‘Freedom is not free.’’ Indeed, the free-
doms that we enjoy in America, that so 
many countries around the world enjoy 
right now because of our military 
members over the course of history, 
decades—I always like to say, probably 
the greatest force in liberating man-
kind from oppression and tyranny in 
the world is the U.S. military. Think 
about it. Hundreds of millions of peo-
ple. World War I; World War II; the 
Civil War, of course; but the Korean 
war, certainly. Over 37,000 Americans 
were killed in action, over 8,000 are 
still listed as missing in action, and 
over 103,000 Americans were wounded. 
And, of course, the killed and wound-
ed Korean veterans and military and 
civilians from that war are literally in 
the millions—in the millions. But what 
also resonates are the very, very tan-
gible results of the war in terms of 
freedom. 
Many of us have seen the famous sat-
ellite images at night taken over the 
Korean Peninsula—the whole penin-
sula. And if you look at the 38th par-
allel and what is north, it is literally 
dark and looks cold and looks lifeless. 
And if you look at everything south in 
that satellite picture, it is alive, burst-
ing with life, and light. 
In my view, there are very few better 
illustrations of the disparity between 
freedom and authoritarianism than the 
image of that Korean Peninsula at 
night with those two countries—one is 
bright and alive, and one is dark and 
literally 
dead. 
American 
citizens, 
American soldiers, American military 
kept an entire country free. 
So what happened last week? I didn’t 
think this war memorial, to be honest, 
could be improved—one of my favor-
ites: powerful, as I have talked about; 
great words—but it was improved. 
Last Wednesday, I had the oppor-
tunity to attend the dedication—real-
ly, the rededication—of the Wall of Re-
membrance that was added to the Ko-
rean War Memorial last week. The wall 
now has engraved on it the 36,573 Amer-
icans that were killed in action—every 
one of them—like the Vietnam wall. 
This is an example of what you will 
see at the new memorial. I encourage 
everybody, every American, if you are 
in DC, go take a look; go pay your re-
spects. It is so moving. It is dramati-
cally improved, this memorial, which I 
didn’t think could be improved upon. 
Importantly, 
intermixed 
in 
the 
names of the Americans are also the 
7,200 KATUSA soldiers. These were the 
Korean Army personnel who served 
with American forces, right alongside 
them. So they are just here. They are 
not divided by American and Korean. 
Those are just the ones who served 
with the Americans. Again, the Korean 
military—their killed-in-action num-
bers are way higher than even these. 
And here is the other thing that is so 
moving 
about 
this 
memorial. 
The 
names are actually laid out by serv-
ice—Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. 
And they are actually listed according 
to rank. So if you look at the Vietnam 
Memorial, it is mixed in. It doesn’t 
matter what service. And it is the date 
in which somebody was actually killed, 
chronologically. 
This is by military service and their 
rank. Why does that matter? What 
does it mean? Well, I will tell you what 
it means. It depicts the sacrifice of 
war, regardless of what the war is. 
Wars throughout history, up until now, 
always fall upon the young men and 
women of our great Nation—the 18-, 
19-, 20-year-olds. They are the ones who 
do the fighting, and they are the ones 
who do the dying. 
So, for example, this is actually a 
picture of the section after section 
after section after section, which is 
just U.S. Army Private First Class— 
U.S. Army PFCs. And it is just thou-
sands, one group. Huge sacrifice. Huge 
sacrifice. 
So I encourage everybody to go out, 
take a look at this newly improved Ko-
rean War Memorial that was dedicated 
last week. It was such a moving cere-
mony. It was made all the more mov-
ing by the beautiful voice of Miss 
America, Emma Broyles, who sang 
‘‘God Bless America’’ in front of the 
thousands of veterans who were there— 
thousands—Americans, Koreans. 
By the way, Emma is a constituent 
of mine. She is the first Alaskan to win 
Miss America, first Korean American 
to ever win Miss America. So she did a 
great job. 
And the final thing I just want to 
mention—and I think the whole Sen-
ate—I am working on a Senate resolu-
tion, and I would love to get some of 
my colleagues here on the floor right 
now to join this resolution with me. It 
is a simple resolution saying thank you 
to the Korean government and the Ko-
rean people, because guess who paid for 
this memorial. It wasn’t the American 
taxpayer. It was the Korean Govern-
ment and the people of Korea. Over 22 
million. We had tremendous support 
from our Korean war American vet-
erans associations. They did a great 
job. But the vast, vast bulk of the fund-
ing for this new, incredibly moving Ko-
rean War Memorial was from the peo-
ple of Korea and the Government of 
Korea. And they sent their defense 
minister, they sent their veterans af-
fairs minister, they sent a huge delega-
tion of members of their legislature all 
for this ceremony. So I want to thank 
all of them. 
And I want to thank our veterans, 
our Korean War veterans, who served 
in the noble war—not the forgotten 
war, the noble war, a proud moment of 
history between our two great na-
tions—a history that has bonded us— 
the Republic of Korea and the United 
States of America—for decades. 
And now our Gold Star families and 
Korean War veterans can visit the 
names of their friends and families and 
loved ones who did this, as the memo-
rial says: 
Answered the call to defend a country they 
never knew and a people they never met. 
That is why this should be called the 
noble war. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, my re-
marks are coming about 6 minutes

f 
REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL ETHYLE E. O’NEAL 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, Or-
egonians will soon gather to honor an 
American hero, Ethyle O’Neal. Ethyle 
will be posthumously awarded the Con-
gressional Gold Medal next month in 
McMinnville, OR. When the Senate 
voted to award the medal to Ethyle 
and her fellow Civil Air Patrol volun-
teers from WWII, it was with the her-
oism and devotion to service she em-
bodied in mind. Since I won’t be able to 
attend the ceremony, I want to spend a 
few minutes today to honor her out-
standing legacy, her service, the com-
munities she bettered, and the family 
she has left behind. 
Born and raised in my hometown, 
Portland, 
14-year-old 
Ethyle 
E. 
Kremers was the first from her high 
school to volunteer for the Civil Air 
Patrol, or CAP. With the U.S. military 
tied up in WWII, the CAP was tasked 
with patrolling America’s borders to 
detect threats, deter submarine at-
tacks, and protect vital shipping lanes. 
Ethyle trained as a radio-communi-
cator and support person, as well as 
taking on the responsibilities of cadet 
training at dozens of CAP camps across 
the country. Six years after joining the 
CAP, Ethyle used her training to sin-
gle-handedly save the life of a young 
child and assist in the rescue of four 
more during the Vanport Flood dis-
aster. For the rescues, she became the 
first CAP cadet to receive the pro-
gram’s 
highest 
honor, 
the 
Distin-
guished Service Award. Soon after, 
Ethyle joined the U.S. Air Force and 
trained as a medical laboratory assist-
ant at Edwards Air Force Base, where 
she met her future husband Theodore 
O’Neal. The two went on to have four 
wonderful 
children: 
Timothy, 
Ken, 
Kathy, and Susie. 
After years traveling with her family 
to Air Force bases around the world, 
Ethyle 
returned 
to 
Portland. 
She 
shortly resumed work with the CAP as 
commander of the Milwaukie and then 
Beaverton Cadet Squadrons. Tasked 
with training new recruits, Ethyle’s 
dedication to the role was matched 
only by the compassion she showed to 
her cadets. Her family still remembers 
Ethyle inviting cadets over to her 
house to study and practice maneuvers 
around the dining room. For her serv-
ice, Ethyle was awarded the CAP’s 
highest award for adult officers, the 
Gill Robb Wilson Award, and the grade 
of lieutenant colonel. In addition to 
training new cadets, Ethyle began fly-
ing search and rescue sorties as a mis-
sion observer, took the role of director 
of cadet programs, earning numerous 
commendations for her work. 
Ethyle was also an active member of 
her community outside of the CAP. For 
13 years, she worked as a bus driver for 
children with special needs, ensuring 
education remained accessible for the 
most vulnerable in society. She also 
loved teaching local children to fly 
model rockets. 
A model of selflessness, Ethyle’s ac-
complishments survive her, reminding 
us that the efforts of a determined few 
can raise, or even save, the lives of 
many. Ethyle’s success as a woman in 
the Armed Forces and work with chil-
dren with special needs inspire me to 
continue my own work for these under-
represented groups. It is an honor to 
remember her achievements, and I can 
think of nobody more deserving of the 
Congressional Gold Medal. It is my sin-
cere hope that her story continues to 
inspire the best in all who hear it, in 
Oregon and across the Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3804 
August 1, 2022 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DEBORAH CROSS 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
am honored to recognize Deborah Cross 
of Manchester as July’s Granite Stater 
of the Month. After surviving stage 4 
cancer, Deborah used her artistic tal-
ents to create photo journals to help 
other cancer patients process their 
emotions and find resilience. 
After recovering from endometrial 
cancer in 2014 and living cancer-free for 
almost 4 years, Deborah received awful 
news from her doctor. Her cancer had 
come back. While Deborah was dev-
astated by the news, she also found sol-
ace in a creative outlet that would also 
help others. 
Deborah 
began 
creating 
booklets 
with strikingly edited photos of nature 
in New Hampshire, for example, images 
of seagulls and ocean sunsets around 
the New England coast. Below the 
photos are blank lines where cancer pa-
tients can journal. Deborah hopes that 
the photos can evoke deeper emotions 
that patients might be struggling with 
in a time of intense personal hardship. 
In addition, some of the proceeds from 
the sales go to the North of Boston 
Cancer Resource. 
Deborah 
exemplifies 
the 
Granite 
State spirit of giving back to others 
and bringing people together even dur-
ing challenging times. She took an im-
mensely difficult experience—battling 
with stage 4 cancer—and found her way 
through it by creating art that would 
touch others. I commend her for her 
work and know that her story will in-
spire others to make a difference in 
their communities.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Ms. 
MURKOWSKI, Ms. SINEMA, and 
Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 4688. A bill to guarantee that 
Americans have the freedom to make 
certain reproductive decisions without 
undue government interference; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, for nearly 
half a century, the Supreme Court held 
that the right to make reproductive de-
cisions was protected by the 14th 
Amendment. Generations of women 
have relied on the freedom to make re-
productive health decisions as a matter 
of fundamental personal rights. In par-
ticular, seminal cases such as Roe v. 
Wade, Planned Parenthood of South-
eastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, Whole 
Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, Gris-
wold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. 
Baird, and Carey v. Population Serv-
ices International established basic 
rights to obtain abortion services and 
access contraception. 
The Supreme Court’s recent decision 
in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health 
overruled Roe v. Wade and Planned 
Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsyl-
vania v. Casey, the landmark decisions 
holding that a woman’s right to a pre- 
viability abortion is constitutionally 
protected. As the dissenters in Dobbs 
observed, this right is ‘‘embedded in 
core constitutional concepts of indi-
vidual freedom, and of the equal rights 
of citizens to decide on the shape of 
their lives.’’ The Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Dobbs resulted in immediate 
abortion bans in several States and 
means that millions of women, particu-
larly women who live in the South, 
parts of the Midwest, and the West, 
will live hundreds of miles from the 
nearest abortion clinic. In fact, ap-
proximately 17 million women could be 
forced to travel more than 200 miles in 
order to obtain abortion care. 
Not only does the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Dobbs upset decades of 
precedent 
protecting 
the 
right 
of 
Americans to make personal decisions 
about abortion, but it also places in 
jeopardy many other important 14th 
Amendment rights, including the right 
to access birth control. Because the 
Supreme Court has abandoned con-
stitutional protection of reproductive 
rights, it is the responsibility of Con-
gress to act. 
That is why Senators MURKOWSKI, 
SINEMA, COLLINS, and I are introducing 
the Reproductive Freedom for All Act, 
bipartisan legislation to guarantee pro-
tections for reproductive and contra-
ceptive care by enacting the essential 
holdings of the landmark cases Roe v. 
Wade, Planned Parenthood of South-
eastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, Whole 
Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, Gris-
wold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. 
Baird, and Carey v. Population Serv-
ices International. The Reproductive 
Freedom for All Act returns Federal 
law to its pre-Dobbs status by allowing 
pre-viability 
abortions, 
prohibiting 
States 
from 
banning 
post-viability 
abortions necessary to protect the life 
and health of the mother, and pro-
tecting access to contraception. The 
Reproductive Freedom for All Act cre-
ates a minimum Federal standard 
which states must follow. The bill also 
ensures that the U.S. Department of 
Justice or individuals adversely af-
fected by a State abortion restriction 
can challenge any State restriction on 
reproductive freedom in court. 
The Supreme Court’s overturning of 
Roe and Casey goes directly against 
the will of the people. More than 60 
percent of Americans believe abortion 
should be legal in all or most cases. 
Support for reproductive freedom tran-
scends regional, political, ethnic, and 
religious differences. Since support for 
reproductive freedom is nonpartisan 
among the public, it is important to 
have a legislative vehicle protecting 
that freedom that can gain bipartisan 
support. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
passage of the Reproductive Freedom 
for All Act. It is imperative that Con-
gress come together to ensure that de-
cisions as fundamental as reproductive 
choice are not determined by the State 
or ZIP Code where someone lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3807 
August 1, 2022 
I thank my colleagues for standing 
together in support of a bipartisan so-
lution to the crisis created by Dobbs. I 
also acknowledge the work of advo-
cates supporting Michigan’s Reproduc-
tive Freedom for All ballot initiative, 
which informed my work on this bill 
and which I hope will inspire similar 
efforts in other States. We must come 
together to pass the Reproductive 
Freedom for All Act now. 
Mr. President, I rise to essentially do 
a part two of a talk that I gave on the 
Senate floor about 2 weeks ago. The 
first part of my talk was my analysis 
of the Dobbs decision of the Supreme 
Court, expressing my deep disillusion-
ment with the Court’s decision to cast 
aside a century of precedent under the 
14th Amendment due process clause 
and, in particular, casting aside 50 
years of using the 14th Amendment to 
protect women’s rights to make repro-
ductive decisions with regard to con-
traception and abortion. 
I analyzed the Court’s opinion and 
precedents at that time, but I sort of 
left it hanging what needs to be done 
because while we can critique the 
Court decision, and I do view it as com-
pletely ahistorical and not under-
standing 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
14th 
Amendment, nevertheless, the Court’s 
majority ruling was the protection of 
reproductive 
freedom 
was 
now 
no 
longer a matter for constitutional pro-
tection but was, instead, for legisla-
tures. 
The majority seemed to assume that 
that would be State legislatures, but at 
least one of the concurring opinions ac-
knowledged legislatures could include 
Congress. 
And I take the floor today in the sec-
ond part of this talk to discuss a bill 
that I have today introduced with 
three other Senate colleagues—Senator 
SINEMA, Senator COLLINS, and Senator 
MURKOWSKI—the 
Reproductive 
Free-
dom for All Act, taking the Supreme 
Court up on the challenge that what we 
need to do to protect reproductive free-
dom is to legislate to do so. 
Let me describe the origin of the bill. 
Beginning in February, the Senate has 
had two votes on a bill that I have co-
sponsored—the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act, which was designed—writ-
ten before the Dobbs case but designed 
to protect reproductive freedom by dis-
abling State legislatures from putting 
schemes and obstacles in the way of 
women making reproductive decisions. 
The first time we had a vote on that 
bill, I voted yes. It was in February. It 
received 49 votes. We were scheduled to 
have a second vote on the Women’s 
Health Protection Act in May. And it 
occurred to me that we would likely 
have the same result; we would get 49 
votes. 
And I had a strong feeling before that 
vote that if that was the case, we 
would be leaving votes on the table. By 
that, I understood from talking to my 
colleagues that there were more than 
49 Members of this Chamber who want-
ed to codify Roe and related cases and 
protect women’s rights to access con-
traception and abortion services but 
that it wouldn’t be ideal to send a mes-
sage that less than a majority of the 
Senate was committed to reproductive 
freedom. And so I began efforts in May 
to find additional votes beyond the 49 
that I knew would vote yes on the 
WHPA. And I began discussions with 
colleagues, including Republican col-
leagues, to look for a way to codify Roe 
that, yes, might be different in wording 
from the Women’s Health Protection 
Act but would accomplish the same 
goal of providing a Federal guarantee 
that would operate in every ZIP Code 
in this country to protect women’s 
rights to make decisions about contra-
ception and abortion. 
And today we have introduced that 
bill, the Reproductive Freedom for All 
Act. The name of it is a tribute to a 
ballot 
initiative 
that 
is 
currently 
under debate in Michigan and sched-
uled for a vote to be added to the 
Michigan Constitution in November, 
the Reproductive Freedom for All ini-
tiative. And the bill that we have put 
together 
fairly 
closely 
tracks—not 
identically but fairly closely tracks 
the language of the ballot referendum 
in Michigan. 
What does the bill do? We worked on 
the bill between the leak of the Dobbs 
opinion and when Dobbs was decided by 
the Supreme Court right before our 
July Fourth recess. And we worked to 
make the bill as strong as we could. 
But then we set it aside because we 
knew the Dobbs decision might change 
from the leaked opinion, and we want-
ed to see what was actually in the 
opinion before we finalized the bill. 
And it is good that we waited because 
there were some aspects of the Dobbs 
opinion that were a bit different. They 
took some sandpaper to some con-
troversial parts of the case, and they 
extended other arguments in the case 
that needed a response. 
And so what we have done since 
Dobbs is analyzed the opinion but also, 
more importantly, looked at life in the 
United States since that decision was 
rendered. I could give many examples, 
even in the month since that decision 
has been rendered, of the tragedy of 
what I believe is now post-Dobbs Amer-
ica. 
In particular, when a 10-year-old 
child has to be smuggled across State 
lines to receive care following her rape, 
that is gruesome. That is not what this 
country should expect, nor, indeed, 
what we should tolerate. And yet that 
is not an accidental byproduct of the 
Dobbs decision. That was a completely 
foreseeable and even foreseen con-
sequence of the Dobbs decision that 
turning it over to 50 States would lead 
to a patchwork of horrible examples 
one after the next. 
I have spoken about another example 
in Virginia. An individual who was liv-
ing in Kentucky got a breast cancer di-
agnosis on the day the Dobbs opinion 
was leaked, went to her doctor and 
found out that her contraception could 
potentially cause accelerated growth of 
cancer cells. And so she needed to come 
off contraception to get cancer treat-
ment. She has two young children. She 
is worrying about her own cancer. She 
is trying to keep herself healthy for 
herself but also for her young children. 
If she were to come off contraception, 
there would be the chance of an un-
wanted pregnancy. The cancer treat-
ments also would significantly degrade 
the possibility for a healthy pregnancy, 
but she was now living in a State that, 
post-Dobbs, would not allow her to 
have an abortion. 
She wrote a piece about this in NBC 
News. She was fortunate enough to be 
able to move and get a new job in Vir-
ginia, where she would be able to make 
these choices, but these are the kinds 
of choices, post-Dobbs, people have to 
make every day: Do we smuggle a 
youngster across State lines or does 
someone move from one State to the 
next? Every person in this country, no 
matter what ZIP Code they live in, 
should have a basic Federal guarantee 
about contraception and availability of 
abortion services. 
What the Reproductive Freedom for 
All Act would do would be, essen-
tially—we tried to put ourselves in a 
time machine after Dobbs and travel 
back to the day before the Dobbs deci-
sion. It was a very narrow focus. You 
can look at this in other ways. Some 
folks didn’t like what the law was the 
day before the Dobbs decision. But in 
order to find some bipartisanship—be-
cause, truly, the American public, on a 
bipartisan basis, wants to preserve re-
productive rights—we looked at could 
we come up with a Federal statutory 
guarantee that would match the state 
of constitutional law that existed the 
day before the Dobbs decision and pro-
tect the rights of all to contraception 
access and also protect the rights of all 
to abortion access as it existed before 
Dobbs. 
Simply put, that is this; that prior to 
fetal viability, no State can pass any 
statute regulating abortion that im-
poses an undue burden on a woman 
seeking to exercise that right. And 
post-viability, while a State can more 
significantly 
regulate 
abortion, 
no 
State can deprive any woman of the 
right to receive an abortion should she 
and her health providers determine 
that it is necessary to protect her life 
or health. 
That is the bill that I have intro-
duced today with Senators COLLINS, 
MURKOWSKI, and SINEMA. I thank them 
for working to try to show—because 
now we have shown that there is not a 
minority of the U.S. Senate, but there 
is actually a majority that wants to 
codify Roe and related cases; that we 
might have some differences of opinion 
about the right language to use to do 
that, but there is a difference between 
a Senate where that is only a minority 
sentiment and a Senate where, like in 
the rest of the American public, that is 
a majority sentiment. 
The last thing I will say is this. I am 
very well aware, as are my cosponsors

S3808 
August 1, 2022 
in introducing that bill, that we do not 
have the votes today, should it be put 
up, to get 60 votes in the Senate for it. 
We don’t. Yet I am given some inspira-
tion by the fact that we recently 
passed a gun safety bill where 2 months 
before there were not 60 votes either. 
In fact, for the 10 years I have been in 
the Senate, we have been trying to pass 
legislation in this Chamber to deal 
with the scourge of gun violence and 
again and again and again have fallen 
short of 60 votes even to proceed to leg-
islation. But in the aftermath of trage-
dies in Buffalo and Texas, a decision 
was made by the Members of this delib-
erative body that inaction was no 
longer an option and resolute action to 
protect people’s rights and safety was a 
mandate. 
I believe the Dobbs decision and what 
we have seen since is a catastrophe 
that, as it plays out over time in State 
after State, will also change the dy-
namic in the article I branch and dem-
onstrate the need for a national protec-
tion for reproductive rights rather 
than a 50-State free-for-all in a race to 
the bottom. 
It is in that spirit my colleagues and 
I have introduced this bipartisan bill 
today demonstrating that there is now 
bipartisan support and majority sup-
port in the U.S. Senate to protect re-
productive freedom for all. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join in the introduction of the 
Reproductive Freedom for All Act, a 
bipartisan bill that would ensure the 
right of women to make certain repro-
ductive choices without undue govern-
ment interference. 
I support a woman’s right to have an 
abortion, and I believe that the thresh-
old question of whether or not abortion 
is legal needs to be consistent at the 
national level. States can account for 
regional differences with regulations 
like 
parental 
notification 
require-
ments, but the basic right needs to be 
the same regardless of the State in 
which a woman happens to reside. 
In its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization, the U.S. 
Supreme Court abandoned a nearly 50- 
year precedent that had been re-
affirmed and on which women had re-
lied for decades. The Dobbs ruling was, 
as the Chief Justice described it, a 
‘‘jolt’’ to our legal system. This action 
has further divided the country at a 
moment when now, more than ever in 
modern times, we need the Court to 
demonstrate 
consistency, 
predict-
ability, and restraint. 
Prior to the Court’s decision in 
Dobbs, I introduced, with Senator MUR-
KOWSKI, the Reproductive Choice Act 
to enact in to Federal law the abortion 
rights established by Roe v. Wade and 
affirmed by Planned Parenthood v. 
Casey. 
In the wake of the Dobbs decision, I 
have worked with my colleagues Sen-
ator KAINE, Senator MURKOWSKI, and 
Senator SINEMA
in drafting a more 
comprehensive, bipartisan bill that 
would codify the abortion rights ar-
ticulated by the Supreme Court in Roe, 
Casey and Whole Women’s Health v. 
Hellerstedt, as well as the contracep-
tion rights first articulated in Griswold 
v. Connecticut and later clarified in 
Eisenstadt v. Baird and Carey v. Popu-
lation Services International. 
Our legislation would enshrine im-
portant abortion and contraception 
rights into Federal law without under-
cutting basic conscience protections 
that have been in place for decade and 
that are relied upon by healthcare 
practitioners who have religious objec-
tions. 
Our goal with this legislation is to do 
what the Court should have done—pro-
vide consistency in our laws that 
Americans have relied upon for five 
decades regarding the ability to make 
certain reproductive choices. 
Mr. President, this bill maintains the 
pre-Dobbs status quo. In other words, it 
would ensure that the legal framework 
in place before Dobbs remains the law 
of the land. Our bill accomplishes this 
goal by tracking the Supreme Court’s 
language in the seminal cases I men-
tioned. 
Specifically consistent with decades 
of Supreme Court jurisprudence, the 
Reproductive Freedom for All Act pro-
vides that a State may not impose an 
undue burden on the ability of a 
woman to choose whether or not to 
ternate a pregnancy before fetal viabil-
ity. 
During this time Sates may enact 
reasonable regulations to further the 
health or safety of a woman seeking to 
terminate a pregnancy, unless such 
regulations impose an undue burden. 
After fetal viability, a State may 
regulate or even proscribe the ability 
of a woman to terminate her pregnancy 
but not when such a termination is 
necessary to preserve the life or health 
of the woman. 
Moreover, 
by 
codifying 
Griswold, 
Eisenstadt, and Carey, the bill makes 
clear that a State cannot prohibit an 
individual from obtaining or using con-
traceptives. 
Finally the legislation specifically 
protects conscience protections that 
have been relied upon by healthcare 
providers who have religious objec-
tions. 
Mr. President, the best path forward 
for our country is to maintain the 
same legal framework that was in 
place just weeks ago before the Su-
preme Court issued its ruling in Dobbs. 
Our bill would enshrine into law the 
important protections articulated in 
the Supreme Court cases that I men-
tioned without undercutting statutes 
that also have been in place for dec-
ades. 
I urge all of my Senate colleagues to 
join me in supporting this legislation.

NIZING 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
BORDER PATROL FOR DEPLOY-
ING TO DEL RIO, TEXAS, ON 
SEPTEMBER 
19, 
2021, 
TO 
RE-
SPOND TO THE BORDER CRISIS 
Mr. CRUZ submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs: 
S. RES. 732 
Whereas the Border Patrol operates within 
the Department of Homeland Security, and 
the mission of the Border Patrol is to pro-
tect the people of the United States, safe-
guard the borders of the United States, and 
enhance the economic prosperity of the 
United States; 
Whereas the primary missions of Border 
Patrol agents are— 
(1) to detect and prevent illegal entry and 
smuggling of aliens into the United States 
by land, sea, or air; 
(2) to seek out and apprehend alien smug-
glers; and 
(3) to enforce the criminal provisions of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1101 et seq.); 
Whereas, on his first day in office, Presi-
dent Biden reversed many policies put in 
place by the previous administration, includ-
ing by halting construction of the border 
wall, which has— 
(1) left the borders of the United States 
open and unsecured; and 
(2) led to a self-inflicted border crisis that 
has left the Border Patrol unable to ade-
quately respond to the surge of illegal immi-
grants crossing the southern border of the 
United States; 
Whereas the crisis at the southern border 
of the United States has led to— 
(1) since the date on which President Biden 
took office, a recordbreaking 3,271,585 en-
counters by Border Patrol agents of individ-
uals attempting to cross such border ille-
gally; and 
(2) in May 2022, 239,416 encounters by Bor-
der Patrol agents of illegal immigrants at-
tempting to cross such border, which is the 
highest number of recorded encounters in a 
single month; 
Whereas, on September 19, 2021, an incident 
occurred in Del Rio, Texas, involving ap-
proximately 15,000 aliens from Haiti who 
were attempting to enter the United States 
illegally; 
Whereas Border Patrol severely lacked re-
sources and adequate personnel to handle the 
Haitian migrant crisis, and additional Bor-
der Patrol agents were deployed to the Del 
Rio Sector only 1 day before the Haitian mi-
grant incident occurred; 
Whereas, operating with almost no guid-
ance, communication, or knowledge of oper-
ational goals, several Border Patrol agents 
were instructed by their superiors to assist 
the Texas Department of Public Safety to 
disperse a large crowd of Haitian aliens who 
were attempting to enter the United States 
without authorization or inspection; 
Whereas photographs were taken of Border 
Patrol agents on horseback as they at-
tempted to interdict individuals making ille-
gal border crossings and engage numerous 
Haitian aliens; 
Whereas President Biden, Vice President 
Harris, Secretary of Homeland Security 
Mayorkas, and other Democrat politicians 
rushed to judgment and, without any inves-
tigation or corroborating evidence— 
(1) accused the Border Patrol agents of 
using their horse tack to whip Haitian 
aliens; and

(2) denounced the agents; 
Whereas 4 Border Patrol agents were 
placed on administrative leave as a result of 
the politicization of the incident and the 
rush to judgment by Biden administration 
officials; 
Whereas, despite the Department of Home-
land Security Inspector General and the 
United States Attorney for the Western Dis-
trict of Texas declining to further pursue the 
matter, the Border Patrol has proposed dis-
ciplinary action against the 4 Border Patrol 
agents; and 
Whereas the decision to discipline such 
Border Patrol agents appears to be politi-
cally motivated to provide cover for the rush 
to judgment and blatant mischaracterization 
by the Biden administration of the actions of 
the Border Patrol agents on September 19, 
2021: Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that there is an ongoing and 
growing crisis on the southern border of the 
United States; 
(2) commends the Border Patrol agents 
who were deployed to the southern border to 
respond to the Haitian migrant crisis in Del 
Rio, Texas, on September 19, 2021, for their 
use of restraint in response to the crisis, de-
spite a lack of clear rules of engagement; and 
(3) concludes that the Department of 
Homeland Security should commend, rather 
than punish, the Border Patrol agents who 
answered the call of the United States to re-
spond to such crisis.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr.

Mr. PADILLA, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. LUJA´ N, 
Mrs. CAPITO, and Mrs. SHAHEEN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 733 
Whereas millions of children and youth in 
the United States represent the hopes and 
the future of the United States; 
Whereas numerous individuals, charities 
benefitting children, and youth-serving orga-
nizations that work with children and youth 
collaborate to provide invaluable services to 
enrich and better the lives of children and 
youth throughout the United States; 
Whereas raising awareness of and increas-
ing support for organizations that provide 
access to health care, social services, edu-
cation, the arts, sports, and other services 
will result in the development of character 
in, and the future success of, the children 
and youth of the United States; 
Whereas the month of September, as the 
school year begins, is a time when parents, 
families, teachers, school administrators, 
and communities increase the focus on chil-
dren and youth throughout the United 
States; 
Whereas the month of September is a time 
for the people of the United States to high-
light and be mindful of the needs of children 
and youth; 
Whereas private corporations and busi-
nesses have joined with hundreds of national 
and local charitable organizations through-
out the United States in support of a month- 
long focus on children and youth; and 
Whereas designating September 2022 as 
‘‘National Child Awareness Month’’ would 
recognize that a long-term commitment to 
children and youth is in the public interest 
and will encourage widespread support for 
charities and organizations that seek to pro-
vide a better future for the children and 
youth of the United States: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate designates Sep-
tember 2022 as ‘‘National Child Awareness 
Month’’— 
(1) to promote awareness of charities that 
benefit children and youth-serving organiza-
tions throughout the United States; 
(2) to recognize the efforts made by those 
charities and organizations on behalf of chil-
dren and youth as critical contributions to 
the future of the United States; and 
(3) to recognize the importance of meeting 
the needs of at-risk children and youth, in-
cluding children and youth who— 
(A) have experienced homelessness; 
(B) are in the foster care system; 
(C) have been victims, or are at risk of be-
coming victims, of child sex trafficking; 
(D) have been impacted by violence; 
(E) have experienced trauma; and 
(F) have serious physical and mental 
health needs.

FIGHTING POST-TRAUMATIC 
STRESS DISORDER ACT OF 2022 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4007) to require the Attorney 
General to propose a program for making 
treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder 
and acute stress disorder available to public 
safety officers, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate

had been reported from the Committee 
on the Judiciary with an amendment 
to strike all after the enacting clause 
and insert in lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fighting Post- 
Traumatic Stress Disorder Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Public safety officers serve their commu-
nities with bravery and distinction in order to 
keep their communities safe. 
(2) Public safety officers, including police offi-
cers, firefighters, emergency medical techni-
cians, and 911 dispatchers, are on the front lines 
of dealing with situations that are stressful, 
graphic, harrowing, and life-threatening. 
(3) The work of public safety officers puts 
them at risk for developing post-traumatic stress 
disorder and acute stress disorder. 
(4) It is estimated that 30 percent of public 
safety officers develop behavioral health condi-
tions at some point in their lifetimes, including 
depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, in 
comparison to 20 percent of the general popu-
lation that develops such conditions. 
(5) Victims of post-traumatic stress disorder 
and acute stress disorder are at a higher risk of 
dying by suicide. 
(6) Firefighters have been reported to have 
higher suicide attempt and ideation rates than 
the general population. 
(7) It is estimated that between 125 and 300 po-
lice officers die by suicide every year. 
(8) In 2019, pursuant to section 2(b) of the 
Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness 
Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–113; 131 Stat. 2276), 
the Director of the Office of Community Ori-
ented Policing Services of the Department of 
Justice developed a report (referred to in this 
section as the ‘‘LEMHWA report’’) that ex-
pressed that many law enforcement agencies do 
not have the capacity or local access to the men-
tal health professionals necessary for treating 
their law enforcement officers. 
(9) The LEMHWA report recommended meth-
ods for establishing remote access or regional 
mental health check programs at the State or 
Federal level. 
(10) Individual police and fire departments 
generally do not have the resources to employ 
full-time mental health experts who are able to 
treat public safety officers with state-of-the-art 
techniques for the purpose of treating job-re-
lated post-traumatic stress disorder and acute 
stress disorder.

STRESS DISORDER.
