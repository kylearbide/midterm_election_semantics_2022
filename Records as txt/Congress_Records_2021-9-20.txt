DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, our creator, redeemer, and sus-
tainer, we pray Your inspiration over 
the reconvening of this body. With 
much to be discussed, debated, and de-
cided, allow Your Holy Spirit to brood 
over the tumultuous waters and bring 
order and purpose into this new day. 
Redeem the efforts and intent of all 
who endeavor to steward the respon-
sibilities You have given them. May 
each of us speak out of genuine com-
mitment—not just to the nobleness of 
our position, but to the welfare of our 
common humanity. May we exercise 
courtesy and compassion in our deal-
ings with one another, even those with 
whom we disagree. 
Sustain us when the days grow long 
and patience grows short. When we are 
jealous of our time and sparing of re-
spect, may You, in Your kindness to 
us, cause our love to increase and our 
mutual regard for each other to win 
out. 
Strengthen our hearts that when 
called to account, we will be found 
blameless and holy in Your eyes. In all 
that we do this day, may we reflect 
Your rich love, made all the richer by 
the privilege we have to demonstrate 
Your grace and mercy to those around 
us. 
We pray in the name of the one in 
whom we live, move, and have our 
being. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
JOYCE) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania led the 
Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle.

PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS 
MONTH 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
September is Prostate Cancer Aware-
ness Month. Prostate cancer has led 
male cancer incidence in 96 countries. 
It is the most common cause of death 
among men in 51 countries. The United 
States leads the world in reducing 
prostate cancer deaths. 
One in eight U.S. men will be diag-
nosed with prostate cancer in their 
lifetimes. African-American men are 
over 75 percent more likely to develop 
prostate cancer compared to White 
men and more than twice as likely to 
die from the disease. 
It is important for our men to under-
stand that there are usually no early 
warning signs for prostate cancer. For 
many years the disease may be silent. 
That is why screening is such an im-
portant topic for all men and their 
families. 
Age is the biggest risk factor for 
prostate cancer; rates of diagnosis 
steadily rise as men age into their fif-
ties, sixties, and seventies. 
I have family members and close 
male friends who have suffered from 
prostate cancer but underwent surgery 
and survived. Ask for early screening, 
and please be aware of this month as 
we go through prostate cancer aware-
ness. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MAJOR GENERAL 
CHRISTOPHER DONAHUE 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Major General Christopher Donahue, 
the commander of the 82nd Airborne 
Division and the last American soldier 
to leave Afghanistan. 
A native of Chambersburg, Pennsyl-
vania, and as an officer in our Nation’s 
special forces, General Donahue has de-
voted his life to the service of our Na-
tion. 
During the global war on terrorism, 
General Donohue has led soldiers in 
both Iraq and Afghanistan. He has al-
ways put his soldiers and their mission 
first. As the final soldier in Afghani-
stan, General Donahue showed his de-
votion to our Nation yet again. 
This man is a leader, and our Nation 
is well-served with him commanding

our airborne division. I am grateful for 
General Donahue and for all of the 
brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and ma-
rines who have served in Afghanistan. 
Their service has made our Nation 
more secure. No political decision can 
take away what their service has 
meant.

AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE IT 
IS GOOD 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, President Biden and 
his fellow Democrats have said that 
they want to fundamentally change 
this country. 
If this country is so bad, why do we 
lead the world in technological ad-
vances? 
If this country is so bad, why have 
millions of immigrants risked life and 
limb to get into this country? 
If this country is so bad, why are we 
the international example of religious 
tolerance? 
If this country is so bad, why is the 
dollar the standard currency through-
out the world? 
If this country is so bad, why do we 
lead the world in aiding the impover-
ished countries around the globe? 
If this country is so bad, how could 
American scientists have developed a 
vaccine in record time that has saved 
millions of lives around the globe? 
If this country is so bad, how could 
someone like Dr. Ben Carson overcome 
the most insurmountable of odds to be-
come one of the great neurosurgeons in 
the world? 
If this country is so bad, how is it 
possible that Americans of every back-
ground can uniquely succeed here if 
they are determined to do so? 
If this country is so bad, why do so 
many think it is so good? 
If this country is so good, why are so 
many Democrats so hellbent on tearing 
it apart? 
f 
HURRICANE IDA BUILDING BACK 
BETTER 
(Mr. CARTER of Louisiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I was in New Orleans when 
Hurricane Katrina made landfall. In 
the aftermath, the community came 
together with Federal and State part-
ners to invest in a regional levee sys-
tem to protect the New Orleans area 
from major flooding. 
Sixteen years later, Hurricane Ida hit 
southeast 
Louisiana 
with 
roaring 
winds of around 150 miles per hour. 
Power 
lines 
snapped 
like 
popsicle 
sticks. 
Luckily, the investments we made in 
flood protection largely worked. The 
levees held. 
Sadly, other areas outside of the risk 
reduction zone were still heavily flood-
ed. Sadly, we find ourselves in a situa-
tion that is all too familiar. Our power 
grid was destroyed, leaving around 1 
million-plus people without power in 
the sweltering heat in southeast Lou-
isiana. 
Hurricanes are predicted to become 
more frequent and more intense due to 
climate change. 
The question is: Will our infrastruc-
ture be ready? 
The needed investments to save lives 
were made after Katrina. As the Ida re-
covery continues, we must future-proof 
our power grid and levees to build back 
better. 
f 
GOD HAS SHED HIS GRACE ON 
AMERICA 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I have introduced Articles of 
Impeachment on President Joe Biden. 
The reason why I have done so is for 
his disgraceful actions having to do 
with Afghanistan: abandoning Ameri-
cans and arming a terrorist nation, the 
Taliban, which is treason: giving aid 
and comfort to our enemies. 
I have also introduced Articles of Im-
peachment for the national security 
crisis created at our southern border 
which today is actually being invaded. 
But heading into this week, perhaps 
the most evil and disgusting thing that 
is going to happen in this 117th Con-
gress is the bill that is going to be in-
troduced that makes it a Federal law 
to allow abortion up until the day of 
birth. 
This wall says: In God We Trust. And 
if that is the case, then this Congress 
will reject this evil bill and protect the 
innocent unborn. If this Nation be-
comes a nation where we have such a 
Federal law that can kill a baby up 
until the day of birth, then God will no 
longer provide protection in His grace 
over America. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, in San Diego County, which I 
am proud to represent, since the pan-
demic started, more than 500 childcare 
providers have closed their doors, and 
the families of more than 190,000 kids 
don’t have access to the care they 
need. 
Across the country, nearly 1.6 mil-
lion moms of children under 17 are still 
missing from the labor force—an eco-
nomic crisis decades in the making. 
The Build Back Better Act is a once- 
in-a-generation opportunity to lower 
the cost of childcare, expand avail-
ability, and boost the wages of the es-
sential childcare workers that make 
our country go. 
It isn’t just the right thing for our 
families, it is the right thing for our 
economy. According to a Nobel Prize- 
winning economist, we save $7 for 
every $1 we invest in quality early 
childhood programs. So while some of 
my colleagues may argue that we can’t 
afford to do these things, the truth is 
we can’t afford not to. 
Madam Speaker, we have to meet 
this moment, and we have to build 
back better. 
f 
REMEMBERING DAVIS COUNTY 
COACH DENNIS ANDERSON 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to remember the 
life of a beloved member of the Davis 
County community. Last Wednesday, 
Hall of Fame Davis County coach Den-
nis Anderson passed away after a bat-
tle struggling with stage IV terminal 
cancer. 
Dennis Anderson began his career in 
Davis County athletics in 1968 when he 
started as a physical education teacher 
and varsity track coach. Under his 50 
years 
of 
leadership, 
Mr. 
Anderson 
coached 22 State champions and was 
named Regional Coach of the Year in 
1979, 1980, and 1992 before being hired as 
the school’s athletic director. 
After his retirement from Davis 
County Schools in 2000, Mr. Anderson 
spent 7 years as a zone chief at Iowa 
State track meets and was named 
Southeast Director of the Iowa Track 
Officials Association. 
Thank you, Dennis, for your long-
time service to the Davis County com-
munity and for making Iowa a better 
place through being a mentor and role 
model for Iowa men and women.

INDEPENDENT RESCUE 
OPERATIONS FROM AFGHANISTAN 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to thank vet-
erans, 
non-governmental 
organiza-
tions, congressional offices, and ordi-
nary citizens who have stepped up 
where the Biden administration has 
failed to save the lives of Americans 
and our Afghan allies who fought 
alongside U.S. troops and now are 
trapped behind enemy lines. 
In many cases they have taken the 
lead in helping Americans and our al-
lies flee the country through inde-
pendent rescue operations. 
Veterans like marines Andrew Dar-
lington 
and 
Jeremy 
Horton 
who 
worked with my office tirelessly helped 
those 
Afghans 
whom 
they

honorably in uniform and did so again 
when they were called. 
The administration’s withdrawal has 
been a failure, but these individuals 
who have volunteered to be on the 
front lines of saving lives are heroes, 
and they have shown the world why we 
are an exceptional people. This is not 
about politics; this is about America 
keeping the promises we made. Our

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AF-
FAIRS 
EXPIRING 
AUTHORITIES 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5293) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to extend and modify cer-
tain authorities and requirements re-
lating to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5293 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department 
of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act 
of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR DENTAL 
INSURANCE PLAN FOR VETERANS 
AND SURVIVORS AND DEPENDENTS 
OF VETERANS. 
Section 1712C of title 38, United States 
Code, is amended by striking subsection (j). 
SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY EXPANSION 
OF PAYMENTS AND ALLOWANCES 
FOR BENEFICIARY TRAVEL IN CON-
NECTION WITH VETERANS RECEIV-
ING CARE FROM VET CENTERS. 
Section 104(a) of the Honoring America’s 
Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Fami-
lies Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–154; 126 Stat. 
1169), as most recently amended by section 
5109 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 
2021 and Other Extensions Act (Public Law 
116–159; 134 Stat. 749), is further amended by 
striking ‘‘September 30, 2021’’ and inserting 
‘‘September 30, 2022’’. 
SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR PILOT 
PROGRAM ON ACCEPTANCE BY THE 
DEPARTMENT 
OF 
VETERANS 
AF-
FAIRS OF DONATED FACILITIES AND

114–294; 38 U.S.C. 8103 note) is amended by 
striking ‘‘the date that is 5 years after the 
date of the enactment of this Act’’ and in-
serting ‘‘December 16, 2026’’. 
SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
5293. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
speak today in support of H.R. 5293, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs Expir-
ing Authorities Act of 2021, offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
MRVAN), the chairman of our Tech-
nology Modernization Subcommittee 
and my good friend. 
This package ensures continued oper-
ations of several programs that are 
vital to addressing the needs of vet-
erans we serve. 
First, this bill removes the December 
31, 2021, expiration date and makes per-
manent VA’s dental insurance pro-
gram. This benefit allows qualifying 
veterans, survivors, and dependents the 
opportunity to purchase discounted 
dental insurance coverage that in-
cludes 
preventive, 
diagnostic, 
endodontic, restorative, surgical, and 
emergency dental services. 
Each individual covered by the pro-
gram pays the entire premium for cov-
erage in addition to the full cost of any 
copays. Enrollment is voluntary and 
does not affect eligible individuals’ en-
titlement to existing VHA outpatient 
dental services and treatment. 
Second, H.R. 5293 will extend VA’s 
authority to provide travel reimburse-
ment for certain veterans living in 
highly rural areas to receive care at 
vet centers. These centers serve as a 
lifeline for veterans who may not feel 
comfortable seeking services at tradi-
tional VA medical facilities. They offer 
individual and group therapy, marriage 
and family counseling, and assist vet-
erans in connecting to other VA bene-
fits. 
H.R. 5293 extends VA’s authority to 
reimburse mileage, tolls, and other 
travel expenses veterans from highly 
rural areas may incur when traveling 
to vet centers. 
Finally, H.R. 5293 will extend for 5 
years VA’s authority to operate the 
Communities Helping Invest through 
Property and Improvements Needed for 
Veterans Act of 2016 or the CHIP IN 
Act. 
This program allows VA to accept do-
nations from non-Federal entities of 
buildings and land that VA will use to 
address long-term infrastructure needs, 
including the delivery of healthcare 
services. 
Examples 
of 
non-Federal 
entities 
that can make donations under the 
pilot include State and local authori-
ties, a donor or donor group, limited li-
ability corporations, or tax-exempt or-
ganizations. 
The CHIP IN Act allows VA to use 
funds that have already been appro-
priated for a particular facility’s con-
struction project to assist a donor of 
real property and improvements with 
financing, designing, or constructing 
the facility to suit VA’s needs. 
Thus far, VA has accepted two dona-
tions: design and construction of a fa-
cility on the grounds of the VA Medical 
Center in Omaha, Nebraska; and con-
struction of an inpatient facility in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma. This bill will extend 
VA’s authority to accept similar dona-
tions in other locations. 
Once again, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 5293, which will authorize 
the continued operation of these im-
portant programs. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5293, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act 
of 2021. This bill is sponsored by the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MRVAN), 
and I thank him for introducing this 
bill to extend expiring authorities and 
programs. 
The VA Expiring Authorities Act of 
2021 would make VA dental insurance 
programs permanent so that veterans 
under VA’s care are able to buy low- 
cost dental insurance coverage. 
It would also allow veterans to con-
tinue to receive travel benefits when 
seeking support at vet centers. 
It would also extend VA’s Commu-
nities Helping Invest through Property 
and Improvements Needed, or CHIP IN 
for Vets pilot program by an additional 
5 years. 
The CHIP IN program allows VA to 
accept real property donations from 
nongovernment entities. The program 
was established by Congress in 2016. It

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5293. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

(c) DETERMINATION OF INCREASE.—Each dol-

able under title II of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) are increased effective 
December 1, 2021, as a result of a determina-
tion under section 215(i) of such Act (42 
U.S.C. 415(i)). 
(d) SPECIAL RULE.—The Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs may adjust administratively, 
consistent with the increases made under 
subsection (a), the rates of disability com-
pensation payable to persons under section

U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to be pub-
lished by reason of a determination made 
under section 215(i) of such Act during fiscal

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 189. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 189, the Veterans’ 
Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjust-
ment Act of 2021, would require the 
Secretary of Veterans’ Affairs to in-
crease the rates of disability com-
pensation for service-connected vet-
erans and the rates of dependency and 
indemnity compensation for survivors 
of veterans, effective December 1, 2021. 
This bill would also increase these 
rates by the same percentage as the 
percentage by which Social Security 
benefits are increased, effective Decem-
ber 1, 2021, and require that the VA 
publish the increased rates in the Fed-
eral Register. 
To me, the actual cost-of-living ad-
justment to veterans’ benefits, other-
wise known as COLA, is much more 
than a rate adjustment tied to infla-
tion. In reality, it is a quality-of-life 
guarantee in the retirement years, es-
pecially for veterans suffering with 
service-connected disabilities and ail-
ments. 
It also comes with the assurance for 
veterans that their survivors will not 
see a steady decline in benefits if the 
economy changes and costs rise after 
they have passed. This guarantee is a 
great source of comfort for veterans as 
they age. I know this because they tell 
me this everywhere I go. 
The yearly COLA increase dem-
onstrates the appreciation from a 
grateful nation in recognition of the 
service and sacrifice of those who vol-
unteer to wear the uniform of our 
country. 
Participating in this gesture of grati-
tude is one of the most rewarding re-
sponsibilities of the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. As chairman, I am hon-
ored to be leading this effort to say 
thank you. 
I want to recognize the work of the 
Disability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs 
Subcommittee 
chair, 
ELAINE 
LURIA, and ranking member TROY 
NEHLS for sponsoring S. 189’s House 
companion, H.R. 3909, and for bringing 
this legislation to the floor with me 
today. 
I am pleased that we are considering 
this bill early this year so veterans will 
not be concerned about its passage by 
the December 1 deadline. This is espe-
cially important to so many feeling the 
economic effects of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
I wholeheartedly support S. 189, and I 
urge all my colleagues to do so as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 189, the Veterans’ Compensation 
Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2021. 
This bill will help ensure that benefits 
paid to veterans who are disabled as a 
result of their military service do not 
lose value because of inflation. 
S. 189 authorizes a cost-of-living in-
crease for veterans and their families 
next year as long as Social Security re-
cipients receive an increase. 
Many disabled veterans and their 
families rely on these compensation 
benefits to pay their bills, such as 
mortgage payments and groceries. In 
some cases, these benefits may even be 
the veteran’s only income. Moreover, 
VA benefits are providing much-needed 
financial support to many veterans fac-
ing uncertainty due to this pandemic. 
We must pass this bill and ensure 
that compensation benefits for our dis-
abled veterans keep pace with rising 
costs. 
I would like to thank Senator THUNE 
for introducing this important legisla-
tion. I urge my colleagues to support S. 
189. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4537 
September 20, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA), my good friend and 
the chair of the Disability Assistance 
and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Veterans’ Com-
pensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment 
Act of 2021. Simply put, this is a well- 
deserved and necessary pay raise for 
our disabled veterans. 
I am proud to represent a district 
with eight major military installa-
tions, including Naval Station Norfolk, 
the largest naval station in the world. 
b 1645 
Ours is a community where one in 
five people is either active duty serv-
icemembers, veterans, or a military 
family member. 
Our veterans, no matter where they 
were deployed or in what capacity they 
served, swore an oath to protect and 
defend the Constitution. They risked 
their lives thousands of miles away to 
keep America safe. And as a 20-year 
Navy veteran myself, I am proud to 
support this bill to ensure that every 
veteran can continue to use their bene-
fits they earned in service to our coun-
try. 
The Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of- 
Living Adjustment Act of 2021, the 
Senate companion to my House bill, 
H.R. 3909, enhances benefits for war-
time disability compensation, com-
pensation for dependents, clothing al-
lowance, dependency and indemnity 
compensation for surviving spouses, 
and compensation to children. It in-
creases the same way that Social Secu-
rity benefits increase to meet the ris-
ing cost of living. 
We have seen costs for disability 
care, clothing, and childcare increase 
over the years, and it is vital that we 
continue to provide benefits that actu-
ally meet the demands our veterans 
face every day. 
Providing quality benefits to our vet-
erans and their dependents can change 
lives, and Congress must honor the 
commitment to those American heroes 
who served. 
Again, I urge swift passage of S. 189 
so that we can responsibly assist our 
Nation’s veterans once again. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in passing S. 
189, The Veterans’ Compensation Cost- 
of-Living Adjustment Act of 2021, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 189. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN W. 
MOSLEY VA CLINIC 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4172) to name the Department of 
Veterans Affairs community-based out-
patient clinic in Aurora, Colorado, as 
the 
‘‘Lieutenant 
Colonel 
John 
W. 
Mosley VA Clinic.’’ 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4172 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-BASED 
OUTPATIENT CLINIC, AURORA, COL-
ORADO. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) John Mosley was born on June 21, 1921, 
in Denver, Colorado. 
(2) In 1945, John Mosley married Edna 
Mosley. 
(3) During World War II, he joined the 
famed Tuskegee Airmen and trained as a 
bomber pilot, serving as one of the first Afri-
can Americans in that role. He earned the 
flight qualification of Command Pilot during 
his service in the United States Air Force. 
The brave service of the Tuskegee Airmen 
helped pave the way for integration of the 
armed services. Edna Mosley worked in the 
defense industry during the war. 
(4) Upon their return to Colorado, Edna 
Mosley joined John as a tireless community 
activist and organizer. Among her many 
achievements, Edna was elected to three 
terms as Aurora’s first African-American 
City Council Woman. While on the Council, 
Mrs. Mosley also served on the Board of Di-
rectors of the Fitzsimons Redevelopment Au-
thority, the entity which provided the vision 
for the development of the University of Col-
orado Health Sciences Center. 
(5) After a brief break from military serv-
ice, John Mosley served during the Korean 
and Vietnam wars. He was an operations offi-
cer in Thailand during the Vietnam War. 
(6) John Mosley retired in 1970 as a lieuten-
ant colonel. 
(7) In 2007, Lieutenant Colonel Mosley and 
the original Tuskegee Airmen received the 
Congressional Gold Medal from President 
George W. Bush. 
(8) John and Edna Mosley continued to 
serve their community long after their re-
tirements, advocating for racial equality, 
women’s rights, veterans’ affairs, housing, 
and education. 
(b) DESIGNATION.—The Department of Vet-
erans Affairs community-based outpatient

(c) REFERENCES.—Any reference to such 
clinic in any law, regulation, map, docu-
ment, record, or other paper of the United 
States shall be considered to be a reference 
to the Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley 
Clinic. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
4172. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the 
life of John W. Mosley, a Denver native 
who began his legendary service to our 
Nation in the United States Army Air 
Corps as a World War II Tuskegee Air-
man, one of our Nation’s first Black 
military aviators. 
This bill, H.R. 4172, will name the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs new com-
munity-based outpatient clinic in Au-
rora, Colorado, as the Lieutenant Colo-
nel John W. Mosley VA Clinic. I thank 
my colleague, Representative JASON 
CROW, a former Army Ranger, for 
championing this effort. 
To 
say 
that 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Mosley led a remarkable life would be 
an understatement. Growing up in a 
segregated neighborhood in Denver, he 
became valedictorian of his high school 
class. 
In 
1939, 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Mosley became a National Merit Schol-
ar and was one of the first Black stu-
dents to attend Colorado State College 
of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, 
which is now Colorado State Univer-
sity. Mosley was the school’s first 
Black 
varsity 
football 
player 
and 
served as vice president of his college 
class as a junior and as a senior. 
At the start of the Second World 
War, Mosley dreamed of serving his 
country as a pilot. After being denied 
the opportunity to join the ROTC pro-
gram in college, Lieutenant Colonel 
Mosley paid for his own flight physical 
and started taking flying lessons. 
And even after the Army Air Corps 
established the Tuskegee Airmen pro-
gram in June 1941, Mosley was not ini-
tially drafted to join them. 
Mosley was instead sent to an artil-
lery unit at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. 
Mosley protested, writing letters to 
Members of Congress and the President 
until he was finally accepted into the 
Tuskegee unit. 
Together, the Tuskegee Airmen flew 
more than 15,000 missions over North 
Africa and Europe during World War II. 
Lieutenant Colonel Mosley later served 
as a pilot in the Berlin Airlift, deliv-
ering loads of supplies to the Soviet- 
blockaded sectors of the city. 
Upon Lieutenant Colonel Mosley’s 
death in 2015 at the age of 93, his son, 
Eric, told the Denver Post that Lieu-
tenant Colonel Mosley always said that 
‘‘he had to fight in order to fight. . . . 
He had to struggle to be able to fight 
for his country.’’

September 20, 2021 
Having paved the way as a Tuskegee 
Airman, Lieutenant Colonel Mosley 
later worked with the Truman admin-
istration to draft policies that would 
eventually fully integrate the United 
States Armed Forces. 
Mosley went on to serve our Nation 
in the United States Air Force during 
the Korean war and Vietnam war, re-
tiring in 1970. 
Mosley then joined the Federal civil 
service, becoming a special assistant to 
the undersecretary in the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and Welfare 
before finally returning home to Colo-
rado where he and his wife, Edna, con-
tinued their civil rights advocacy. 
I should also mention that Edna 
Mosley was a trailblazer in her own 
right, becoming Aurora, Colorado’s, 
first African American city council-
woman in 1992. 
H.R. 4172 has letters of support from 
our Colorado delegation colleagues, the 
American Legion, the Veterans of For-
eign Wars, and the Disabled American 
Veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I include these letters 
in the RECORD.

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
TESTER, 
CHAIRMAN 
TAKANO, RANKING MEMBER MORAN, RANKING 
MEMBER BOST: We write to request your sup-
port to name the new Aurora VA commu-
nity-based outpatient clinic (CBOC) after 
Lieutenant Colonel John Mosley. He was a 
Denver native who lived in Aurora, was a 
Tuskegee Airman, civil rights activist, and 
the first Black football player at Colorado 
State University. 
Lieutenant Colonel John Mosley was born 
the son of a slave. He was the valedictorian 
of his graduating class at Manual High 
School and attended a segregated Colorado 
A&M (now Colorado State University) on an 
academic scholarship, becoming his class 
Vice President and the first African Amer-
ican to play on its football team. 
During World War II, he joined the famed 
Tuskegee Airmen and trained as a bomber 
pilot, serving as one of the first African 
Americans in that role. He earned the flight 
qualification of Command Pilot during his 
service in the United States Air Force. He pi-
loted bombing missions over Europe and 
North Africa. The brave service of the 
Tuskegee Airmen helped pave the way for in-
tegration of the armed services. 
Lieutenant Colonel John Mosley went on 
to fight in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. He 
became special assistant to the undersecre-
tary in the Department of Health, Edu-
cation, and Welfare in Washington, D.C. be-
fore returning to Colorado. After his retire-
ment, Lieutenant Colonel John Mosley and 
his wife Edna continued to serve Colorado— 
Edna as Aurora City Council Woman—advo-
cating for racial equality, women’s rights, 
veterans’ affairs, housing, and education. 
We would be grateful for your support in 
this effort and hope the Senate and House 
Committees on Veterans Affairs will give it 
their consideration.

RANKING 
MEMBER BOST: Please accept this letter as a 
demonstration of the total support of the 
American Legion Department of Colorado, in 
recognition of naming the new Veterans Ad-
ministration Clinic in Aurora, Colorado as 
‘‘John W. Mosley Veterans Clinic’’. 
The Denver native was the first-ever black 
player on what is now the Colorado State 
University football team, and he was one of 
the first black men trained as a bomber pilot 
during the Second World War, serving with 
the famed Tuskegee Airmen before trading 
in his military service for a life of commu-
nity leadership in Aurora. 
The Tuskegee Airmen flew 15,000 missions 
over North Africa and Europe during the 
Second World War. John also would serve as 
a pilot in the Berlin Airlift after the war, de-
livering loads of supplies to the Soviet- 
blockaded sectors of the city. 
The American Legion Department of Colo-
rado would like to honor his amazing legacy 
of service to God, Country, his fellow vet-
erans, and his community of Aurora, CO 
with our full support and we wholeheartedly 
support and encourage the committee to 
sponsor and support legislation naming the 
new Aurora Veterans Clinic after this distin-
guished WWII Veteran. 
On behalf of the 21,000 members of The

fully endorse this effort.

AND
RANKING

demonstrating the total support of the De-
partment of Colorado Disabled American 
Veterans, in recognition of the ongoing ini-
tiative to name the new Aurora VA Commu-
nity-Based Outpatient Clinic to the Lieuten-
ant Colonel John W. Mosley Community 
Based Outpatient Clinic, in memory of 
United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel 
‘‘retired’’ John W. Mosley. 
Lieutenant Colonel Mosley served in the 
U.S. Army Air Corps and then subsequently 
the U.S. Air Force from WWII, then Korea, 
and Vietnam. He was also a Tuskegee Air-
man in WWII. After WWII, he was called 
upon to work with the Truman Administra-
tion to draft the policies that would fully in-
tegrate the U.S. armed forces. In addition, 
Colonel Mosley also served in a variety of 
federal positions. 
Colonel Mosley was also a strong civil 
rights activist, fighting for the right to at-
tend CSU, becoming the first black Amer-
ican to play football and wrestled at CSU, 
and elected as his class Vice President in 
both his junior and senior college years. 
Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley em-
bodied the Air Force value of loyalty, duty, 
respect, and selfless service to his fellow vet-
erans and his country. 
The Department of Colorado Disabled 
American Veterans would like to honor his 
outstanding legacy with our full support, en-
dorsement, and we most strongly encourage 
this committee to support legislation renam-
ing the Aurora VA Community-Based Out-

AND
RANKING 
MEMBER BOAST: Please accept this letter as a 
demonstration of total support of the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars Department of Colo-
rado, in recognition of changing the name of 
the Veterans Administration Clinic in Au-
rora, Colorado currently called the Aurora 
Gateway CBOC Replacement (VHA19–554– 
2016–29466) to ‘‘Lieutenant Colonel John W. 
Mosley VA Clinic’’. 
Renaming the Aurora Gateway Veterans 
Affairs Medical Clinic Replacement facility 
in respect to John W. Mosley is the ideal 
honor to bestow upon a legendary U.S. Air 
Force Tuskegee Airman who piloted bomb-
ing missions over Europe, North Africa, 
Korea, and Vietnam. Lt. Col. Mosley’s life of 
service extended from his student days at 
Colorado State University in the late 1930s 
where he broke color barriers when he was 
elected class vice president in both of his 
junior and senior years to after World War II 
where he worked with the Truman adminis-
tration to draft the policies that would fully 
integrate the United States Armed Forces 
and further in the Denver metro area late 
into his life. 
Veterans of Foreign Wars, Colorado proud-
ly supports legislation to rename the new 
Veterans Affairs replacement medical clinic 
in Aurora, CO as the John W. Mosley Aurora 
Gateway CBOC. Lt. Col. Mosley distin-
guished himself throughout his life with 
service to our country and community serv-
ice efforts that improved the lives of all 
those who call Denver and Aurora home. 
Lt. Col. Mosley was the embodiment of the 
U.S. Air Force Tuskegee Airmen values, loy-
alty, duty, respect, and selfless service to his 
fellow veterans and his country. The Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars Colorado would like to 
honor his amazing legacy with our full sup-
port and encourage the committee to sup-
port legislation renaming the Aurora Gate-
way CBOC Replacement (VHA19–554–2016–

State.

lives on and continues to inspire future 
generations to break barriers and fight 
for justice and equality. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4172, a bill to name the VA 
community-based 
outpatient 
clinic, 
CBOC, in Aurora, Colorado, after Lieu-
tenant Colonel John W. Mosley. 
Lieutenant Colonel Mosley was one 
of the famed Tuskegee Airmen. Mosley 
served honorably in World War II, as 
well as the Korean war and the Viet-
nam war. 
Mosley went on to a career in govern-
ment, serving in D.C. before returning 
to Colorado as a long-time community 
leader and advocate. 
Congressman JASON CROW from Colo-
rado has introduced this bill to name 
the VA CBOC in Aurora, Colorado, 
after Lieutenant Colonel Mosley, and I 
am in full support and hope that my 
colleagues will join me. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. CROW), the author of this leg-
islation 
and 
also 
a 
subcommittee 
chairman of the Small Business Com-
mittee and a member of the House 
Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding and for his lead-
ership and support, as well as the mem-
bers of the committee and the com-
mittee staff for making sure that this 
bill received full and quick consider-
ation. 
I do rise today in support of H.R. 4172 
to name the new Department of Vet-
erans Affairs community-based out-
patient clinic in Aurora, Colorado, for 
Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley. 
Lieutenant Colonel Mosley embodies 
the finest our country has to offer. 
Mosley was an inspirational leader in 
the Aurora community and in the Air 
Force. 
Mosley was born in Denver, Colorado, 
in 1921 and broke barriers at a time 
where Black men and women were pre-
vented from achieving the full rights of 
their citizenship and full participation 
in the military. 
Colonel Mosley attended what is now 
Colorado State University and became 
the first ever Black player on the foot-
ball team. 
After college, Colonel Mosley wanted 
to become a pilot, so he paid to get his 
own pilot’s license. When the Air Force 
didn’t assign him to be a pilot, he lob-
bied his own command in D.C. to assign 
him to a pilot role. He was eventually 
assigned to the segregated Tuskegee 
Airmen unit. 
During World War II, he trained as a 
bomber pilot, serving as one of the first 
African Americans in that role. He 
earned the flight qualification of Com-
mand Pilot during his service in the 
U.S. Air Force. The brave service of the 
Tuskegee Airmen and Colonel Mosley 
helped pave the way for integration of 
the armed services. 
Upon his return, he married Edna, 
and together John and Edna Mosley be-
came tireless community activists and 
organizers. Among her many achieve-
ments, Edna was elected to three terms 
as Aurora’s first African American city 
councilwoman. 
After a brief break from military 
service, Colonel Mosley served during 
the Korean and the Vietnam wars. 
Three conflicts. Mosley was an oper-
ations officer in Thailand during the 
Vietnam war. 
So naming the new Aurora clinic 
after Colonel Mosley honors his legacy 
and will inspire future generations to 
break barriers. I can’t think of a better 
name for my fellow veterans to be 
walking in to this new clinic in Aurora, 
Colorado, than to see the name of Colo-
nel John Mosley as they walk in and to 
remember his service, his sacrifice, his 
leadership, and the best of what we can 
be as a country. 
I thank the House Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee for their work to advance 
this bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this effort to 
honor Lieutenant Colonel John Mosley. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close, but before I do I will just let the 
gentleman from Colorado know that I 
am honored to represent the University 
of California Riverside, which is the re-
pository of the Tuskegee Airmen Col-
lection, which is formerly known as 
the Tuskegee Airmen Archives. 
We are proud to have the papers of 
many of the 992 pilots who graduated 
from the Tuskegee Air Field courses 
who advanced race relations in our 
country. I am certainly hopeful that 
we will have the availability of the pa-
pers from Colonel Mosley that might, if 
it is not already in our archives, to be 
added. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 4172 to name the VA clinic in Au-
rora, Colorado, as the Lieutenant Colo-
nel John W. Mosley VA clinic, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
1281. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the 
life of Navy Corpsman Steve Andrews, 
who passed away on January 28, 2017. I 
thank my colleague, General Bergman 
from Michigan, for bringing this bill 
before us so we all can pay tribute to a 
lifelong public servant. 
Mr. Speaker, Steve Andrews grew up 
in Gaylord, Michigan, and graduated 
from Gaylord High School. He joined 
the Navy during the Vietnam war in 
1967 and served as a hospital corpsman 
at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guam. He 
also served as a medic for the 1st Ma-
rine Division and Marine 1st Recon-
naissance Company in Vietnam. 
Mr. Speaker, Corpsman Andrews is 
credited with saving the lives of nu-
merous marines during his time in 
Vietnam. In recognition of his excep-
tional service in combat, he was award-
ed a Purple Heart and a Navy Com-
mendation Medal. 
However, Steve Andrew’s service to 
his community and country did not end 
with military service. He was elected 
to the 106th District in the Michigan

House of Representatives and held of-
fice from 1979 to 1982. Steve Andrews 
remained an active public servant for 
Petoskey and Emmet County, working 
as a friend of the court and a board 
member of the Petoskey Regional 
Chamber of Commerce and North Cen-
tral College. He also coached multiple 
sports teams and was a constant pres-
ence in the local community. 
Steve was also a steward of the arts, 
helping found Petoskey Art in the 
Park. He and his wife, Karen, owned 
and operated Sturgeon River Pottery 
for 35 years. 
Corpsman Andrews’ dedication to 
serving his community will inspire 
Gaylord VA Health Care Clinic staff to 
serve veterans, just as Steve did. 
We hope that naming the Gaylord, 
Michigan, VA Outpatient Clinic after 
Corpsman Steve Andrews will honor 
the outstanding care that he provided 
his fellow soldiers. 
H.R. 1281 has letters of support from 
The American Legion, the Veterans of 
Foreign Affairs, the Disabled American 
Veterans, and the American Veterans 
organization. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
those letters and a resolution in sup-
port. 
DEPARTMENT
OF
MICHIGAN, VET-
ERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE 
UNITED STATES, 
Lansing, Michigan, 14 June 2021. 
TO THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 
AND SENATE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEES: 
The Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of 
Michigan enthusiastically supports the nam-
ing of the Gaylord Veteran Affairs Commu-
nity Based Outpatient Clinic to be ‘‘Navy 
Corpsman Steve Andrews Department of 
Veterans Affairs Health Care Clinic’’. 
Steve Andrews was a Navy Corpsman, 
whose heroic actions in Vietnam are credited 
for saving countless Marine Corps lives dur-
ing combat. A Navy Commendation and Pur-
ple Heart recipient, Andrews is originally 
from Gaylord and is a graduate of Gaylord 
High School. Mr. Andrews was a citizen of 
Gaylord, where he also served as a friend of 
the court, coached multiple sports in the re-
gion, served as a board member for the 
chamber of commerce, and was a State Rep-
resentative for the 106th District from 1979– 
1982. 
The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the city of 
Gaylord, and this great Nation are grateful 
for the selfless acts of this individual. We 
hope that by naming this facility after a 
Purple Heart recipient of the Vietnam War, 
we might begin to show all Vietnam Vet-
erans how much this country appreciates 
their sacrifices for this Nation. No matter 
how long overdue. 
We thank Congressman Bergman and all 
Members of Congress who support this mean-
ingful legislation.

DEPARTMENT OF MICHIGAN 
June 27, 2021. 
TO THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 
AND SENATE VETERAN’S AFFAIRS COMMITTEES: 
The Disabled American Veterans, Depart-
ment of Michigan fully supports Congress-
man Bergman’s legislative initiative to 
name the Gaylord Veterans Affairs Based 
Outpatient Clinic the ‘‘Navy Corpsman Steve 
Andrews Department of Veteran’s Affairs 
Health Care Clinic.’’ 
Navy Corpsman Andrews entered the Navy 
in 1967, and served in the 1st Marine Divi-
sion/1st Force Reconnaissance Company in 
Vietnam. During his time in service to our 
nation, he was credited with saving count-
less American lives. In recognition for his 
selfless sacrifices, he was awarded the Navy 
Commendation Medal and Purple Heart. Mr. 
Andrews continued his service to our state 
and nation after his military service by hold-
ing the position of State Representative for 
the 106th District from 1979–1982. 
The DAV Department of Michigan believes 
naming the Gaylord Veterans Affairs Based 
Outpatient Clinic in honor of Mr. Andrews 
will ensure that the dedication to duty dis-
played by him and by so many of our Viet-
nam Era Veterans will be remembered by all. 
Mr. Andrew’s selfless sacrifice and dedica-
tion to our nation is not only an inspiration 
to all of us who have served, but also to gen-
erations of future veterans that will answer 
our nations call. 
Sincerely, 
ALBERT HUGHES, 
State Commander.

at the U.S. Naval Hospital at Guam; and 
Whereas, Steve Andrews served as a medic/

Resolved, By The American Legion, De-
partment of Michigan, in annual Department 
Convention assembled in Sault Ste. Marie, 
Michigan, July 9–11, 2021, That The Amer-
ican Legion, Department of Michigan, sup-
port the efforts of Michigan Congressional 
Representative Jack Bergman to name the 
V.A. Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, 
Gaylord, Michigan, the ‘‘Navy Corpsman 
Steve Andrews Department of Veterans Af-
fairs Health Clinic’’. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I whole-
heartedly support this bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1281, a bill to name the VA 
community-based outpatient clinic, or 
CBOC, in Gaylord, Michigan, the Navy 
Corpsman Steve Andrews VA Health 
Care Clinic. 
This bill is cosponsored by my friend, 
fellow marine, and ranking member of 
the Subcommittee on Health, General 
JACK BERGMAN of Michigan. I thank 
him for his leadership. 
Navy 
Corpsman 
Steve 
Andrews 
served during the Vietnam war and re-
ceived both the Navy Commendation 
Medal and the Purple Heart. He was 
also an active member of the Gaylord 
community before and after his time in 
uniform. It is fitting that the VA CBOC 
there will carry his name. 
Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly sup-
port this legislation. I urge all of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
do the same, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-

Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3

gan (Mr. BERGMAN). 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1281 to name 
the Department of Veterans Affairs 
community-based outpatient clinic in 
Gaylord, Michigan, as the Navy Corps-
man Steve Andrews Department of 
Veterans Affairs Health Care Clinic. 
It is an honor for me to lead this leg-
islation to designate a VA care facility 
in the hometown of a man who so em-
bodied love and care for others, wheth-
er it was for a neighbor down the 
street, a constituent in his district, or 
his brothers and sisters in arms on the 
battlefield. 
Steve Andrews led a life of service in 
every sense of the word, starting with 
the defense of our freedoms overseas. 
He entered the Navy in 1967 as a hos-
pital corpsman, going on to serve in 
the Vietnam war—not only at the U.S. 
Navy Hospital in Guam, but as a medic

in the 1st Marine Division attached to 
a force reconnaissance company in 
Vietnam. He is credited with saving 
the lives of countless marines during 
combat. 
Steve earned the Navy Commenda-
tion Medal and Purple Heart for his 
service. I can personally attest that 
countless marines and new generations 
of Americans owe their lives to Navy 
corpsmen. Their service must never be 
forgotten, which is one of the reasons 
we are working to memorialize Steve 
Andrews with this legislation. 
Steve led a dedicated, full life of pub-
lic service. From 1979 to 1982, he rep-
resented Michigan’s 106th District as a 
State 
representative 
fighting 
for 
Michiganders’ best interests in Lan-
sing. Giving back to the community in 
which he grew up, Steve coached local 
youth sports, helped found Petoskey 
Art in the Park, and sat on the boards 
of the Petoskey Regional Chamber of 
Commerce and North Central College. 
I personally met Steve in a rocking 
chair in January of 2016. He was ter-
minal with cancer at that point. He did 
not hesitate to reach out to someone 
he had never met before in his life and 
share his thoughts on what it meant to 
be a public servant. I am deeply in-
debted to his perspective. 
His legacy is beyond deserving of the 
designation that we are seeking today. 
I thank his loving family for all their 
support; his friends, who initiated this 
legislation; 
the 
Michigan 
veterans 
service organizations backing us up; 
and the entirety of my Michigan dele-
gation colleagues for coming together 
in a bipartisan manner to cosponsor 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 1281. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support the bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 1281, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr.

ROBERT S. POYDASHEFF VA 
CLINIC 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3475) to name the Department of 
Veterans Affairs community-based out-
patient clinic in Columbus, Georgia, as 
the ‘‘Robert S. Poydasheff VA Clinic’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3475 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Former Columbus, Georgia, Mayor Rob-
ert S. Poydasheff died on September 24, 2020. 
(2) He earned a B.A. in Political Science 
from the Citadel in 1954, a J.D. from Tulane 
University Law School in 1957, an M.A. in 
International Relations from Boston Univer-
sity’s Graduate Program in Berlin, Germany, 
in 1967, and attended the Hague Academy of 
International Law in the Netherlands in 
preparation for a military and subsequent ci-
vilian career that focused on serving others. 
(3) In 1955, he was commissioned as a Sec-
ond Lieutenant in the Infantry Branch of the 
United States Army, and he was reassigned 
to the Judge Advocate General’s Corps. 
(4) He was a 1976 graduate of the United 
States Army War College and served a total 
of 24 years, retiring as a Colonel in 1979. 
(5) He was decorated with the Legion of 
Merit with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the 
Bronze Star Medal, and Vietnam Ribbon 
with Four Battle Stars, and during his mili-
tary career and because of his expert legal 
acumen he was assigned to work on the big-
gest cases of the time in which he served, but 
during this he never lost sight of what he 
considered his primary role, which was to 
take care of soldiers. 
(6) Robert S. Poydasheff was appointed as 
legal counsel to the Secretary of the Army 
and served the needs of all soldiers by help-
ing to shape Army policy. 
(7) In 2012, the Army War College Founda-
tion named Colonel Poydasheff an Out-
standing Alumnus in recognition of his wide- 
ranging service to his community after his 
retirement from active duty. 
(8) Colonel Poydasheff served on the Co-
lumbus, Georgia City Council from 1994 to 
2002, helping all citizens of the community 
he had come to love while concurrently serv-
ing Fort Benning and his beloved soldiers. 
(9) He was elected Mayor of Columbus, 
Georgia, in 2002, served a four-year term and 
maintained a focus on community-based pro-
grams as well as strengthening the relation-
ship between the city and Fort Benning. 
(10) During that time he made great con-
tributions to the joint military and civilian 
communities of Columbus, Georgia, and Fort 
Benning, appointing first a fellow soldier and 
later the first African American to the City 
Manager position, while knowing that doing 
so would be at his own political peril. 
(11) After his service as Mayor of Colum-
bus, Georgia, Robert S. Poydasheff found 
continued success as a practicing lawyer 
helping countless citizens and soldiers living 
in the city he once led as well as advocating 
for many soldiers in the area. 
(12) His continued interest in the better-
ment of the city as well as his contributions 
to the Veterans Action Committee has a con-
tinued impact to this day. 
(13) He served as past president of the 
Chattahoochee Council Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica, past president of the Chattahoochee Val-
ley Association of the United Sates Army, 
past president of the Columbus Symphony 
Orchestra, member of the Board of Directors 
of the Springer Opera Arts Association, past

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
3475. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 
life of Colonel Robert S. Poydasheff, 
who passed away on September 24, 2020. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
SANFORD BISHOP from Georgia, for in-
troducing this legislation so that we 
can pay tribute to a distinguished serv-
icemember who advocated for veterans 
throughout his life. 
Robert Poydasheff received his bach-
elor of arts in political science from 
The Citadel in 1954. In 1955, he was 
commissioned as a second lieutenant in 
the United States Army as an infantry 
officer. After completing his law edu-
cation 
at 
Tulane 
University, 
Mr. 
Poydasheff continued his military ca-
reer in the Judge Advocate General’s 
Corps. 
Mr. Poydasheff was appointed as 
legal counsel for the Secretary of the 
Army, helping to shape better policy 
for all Army soldiers. He graduated 
from the United States Army War Col-
lege in 1976 and retired in 1979, achiev-
ing the rank of colonel. 
During Colonel Poydasheff’s 24 years 
of military service, he was awarded the 
Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clus-
ters, the Bronze Star Medal, and a 
Vietnam Ribbon with four battle stars. 
He truly embodied the highest quali-
ties of military distinction. 
After retiring from the Army, Colo-
nel Poydasheff was called to serve his 
community in Georgia. He served on 
the Columbus, Georgia, City Council 
from 1994 to 2002, concurrently serving 
the soldiers at Fort Benning. He went 
on to be elected as the mayor of Co-
lumbus 
in 
2002. 
In 
2012, 
Colonel 
Poydasheff was honored by the Army 
War College Foundation as an out-
standing alumnus. 
H.R. 3475 has letters of support from 
The American Legion, the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, and the Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
those letters of support.

THE AMERICAN LEGION, 
DEPARTMENT OF GEORGIA, 
Stockbridge, GA, April 7, 2021. 
Hon. MARK TAKANO, 
Chairman, 
Hon. MIKE BOST, 
Ranking Member, 
House Committee on Veterans Affairs, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
MR. CHAIRMAN
AND
MR. RANKING 
MEMBER: This letter is to serve as written 
support from the American Legion, Depart-
ment of Georgia for the legislation to be in-
troduced which will name the new Veterans 
Administration Clinic in Columbus, Georgia 
as the ‘‘Robert S. Poydasheff Veterans Clin-
ic.’’ 
It is befitting to bestow this honor on Rob-
ert Poydasheff, who passed away September 
2020, and who served as City Council (1994– 
2002) and subsequently as Mayor of Columbus 
(2003–2007). Throughout his mayorship, he 
was a strong advocate for veterans in the Co-
lumbus community. He, too, was a veteran 
who served in the US Army 24 years before 
retiring as a Colonel. His military service 
began as an Infantry Officer with a combat 
tour in Vietnam. He later transferred to the 
Judge Advocate General Corps where he 
worked in various positions for the Sec-
retary of the Army. Mayor Poydasheff em-
bodied the Army values of loyalty, duty, re-
spect, and selfless service to fellow veterans 
and to this country. 
It is with honor that the American Legion,

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
TAKANO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER BOST: Please accept this letter as a 
demonstration of the total support of the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of 
Georgia, in recognition of changing the name 
of the Veterans Administration Clinic in Co-
lumbus, 
Georgia 
to 
‘‘The 
Robert 
S. 
Poydasheff Veterans Clinic.’’ 
Robert Poydasheff served in the United 
States Army for twenty-four years. He began 
his military service as an Infantry Officer, 
where he served one combat tour in Viet-
nam, before transferring to the Judge Advo-
cate General Corps where he worked in a 
number of positions for the Secretary of the 
Army. After retiring from the Army at the 
rank of Colonel he served as a City Counselor 
from 1994 to 2002 and Mayor of Columbus 
Georgia from 2003 to 2007 all the while 
strongly advocating on behalf of Veterans in 
the Columbus community until his passing 
last September. 
Colonel Poydasheff was the embodiment of 
Army values of loyalty, duty, respect and 
selfless service to his fellow Veterans and his 
Country. The Veterans of Foreign Wars of 
Georgia would like to honor his amazing leg-
acy with our full support and encourage the 
committee to support legislation renaming 
the Columbus Veterans Clinic after this dis-
tinguished member of our State. 
Sincerely, 
JOEL L. WILLIS, Jr., 
State Commander, VFW Department 
of Georgia.

fairs, Washington, DC. 
Hon. MIKE BOST,

ington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
TAKANO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER BOST: Please accept this letter as 
demonstrating the total support of the Geor-
gia Department of the Disabled American 
Veterans, in recognition of the ongoing ini-
tiative to rename the new Veterans’ Admin-
istration Clinic in Columbus, Georgia to the 
Robert S. Poydasheff Veterans’ Clinic, in 
memory of United States Army colonel (re-
tired) and mayor of Columbus, Robert S. 
Poydasheff. 
Mayor Poydasheff’s model of selflessness 
in the areas of military service and civic re-
sponsibility should be a shining example for 
all Americans to follow. 
Robert Poydasheff, who passed away last 
September, served as Mayor of Columbus 
from 2003 to 2007. He had previously been a 
City Counselor from 1994 to 2002. Throughout 
Mayor Poydasheff’s career, he strongly advo-
cated on behalf of veterans in the Columbus 
community because he was a veteran him-
self, having served in the United States 
Army for twenty-four years before retiring 
at the rank of colonel. He began his military 
service as an Infantry Officer, where he 
served one combat tour in Vietnam, before 
transferring to the Judge Advocate General 
Corps where he worked in several positions 
for the Secretary of the Army. 
Mayor Poydasheff embodied the Army val-
ues of loyalty, duty, respect and selfless 
service to his fellow veterans and his coun-
try. We would like to honor his outstanding 
legacy. To that end, we offer our support, 
and encourage the committee to support leg-
islation remaining the Columbus facility as 
the Robert S. Poydasheff Veterans Clinic. 
Sincerely, 
CAROLYN V. SMALL, 
Commander, Disabled 
American Veterans, 
Department of Geor-
gia. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I enthu-
siastically support the naming of the 
Columbus, Georgia, VA Community 
Clinic in Robert S. Poydasheff’s honor. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3475, a bill to name the VA 
community-based outpatient clinic, or 
the CBOC, in Columbus, Georgia, the 
Robert S. Poydasheff VA Clinic. I am 
grateful 
to 
Congressman 
SANFORD 
BISHOP from Georgia for introducing 
this bill. 
Mr. Poydasheff was a soldier in the 
United States Army for 24 years. He 
served as an infantry officer in Viet-
nam and later as a judge advocate. He 
continued to serve his country and 
community after his time in the Army 
by pursuing a career in public service 
and elected office. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that all of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
will join me in supporting this bill 
today in honor of him, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. BISHOP), my good friend, the 
chairman 
of 
the 
Agriculture 
Sub-
committee of the House Committee on 
Appropriations, and also a former 
member of the House Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the chair, Chair TAKANO, for 
yielding time. I thank the ranking 
member, along with you and the entire 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs for all 
the work that you do in support of our 
Nation’s veterans and, of course, this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleague, DREW FERGUSON, in offering 
this legislation to honor the former 
mayor of Columbus, Georgia, Colonel 
Robert Stephen ‘‘Bob’’ Poydasheff, Sr. 
The naming of this VA clinic in Co-
lumbus for Bob Poydasheff honors a 
great champion of veterans, an excep-
tional soldier, a distinguished public 
servant, and a dear friend. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is endorsed by 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, The 
American Legion, and the Disabled 
American Veterans, and it is cospon-
sored by every single member of the 
Georgia congressional delegation. 
Sadly, Bob passed away last year on 
September 24. He was a native of the 
Bronx, New York, and he was born with 
an 
innate 
determination 
to 
excel, 
which was apparent in virtually every 
single aspect of his life. He served hon-
orably in the United States Army for 
24 years, and he retired at the rank of 
colonel. 
He began his distinguished military 
career as an infantry officer, serving 
one combat tour in Vietnam before 
transferring to the Judge Advocate 
General’s Corps. 
In recognition of his service to our 
country, he received the Vietnam Rib-
bon, the Legion of Merit, and the Army 
Commendation Medal with two oak 
leaf clusters. He was also elected to the 
Ranger Hall of Fame, located at Fort 
Benning, Georgia. 
b 1715 
Following his military service, Bob 
Poydasheff made Columbus, Georgia, 
his permanent home. Through his lead-
ership, first as a member of the city 
council, then as mayor of the city, Co-
lumbus 
experienced 
extraordinary 
growth and prosperity. 
He was a longtime advocate working 
on behalf of disadvantaged veterans, 
including supporting the location of 
the new VA clinic in Columbus, which 
this bill will name in his honor. Bob 
will be missed, but his legacy will live 
on through the lives of veterans who 
will be helped at this clinic. 
It has been said that you make your 
living by what you get, you make your 
life by what you give. Robert S. ‘‘Bob’’ 
Poydasheff gave so much to so many 
for so long, and this clinic memorial-
izes his legacy.

COMMEMORATING 10TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF REPEAL OF DON’T ASK, 
DON’T TELL 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate the 10th 
anniversary of the repeal of Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell. 
For over 18 years, this discrimina-
tory policy resulted in the discharge of 
thousands of brave, honorable, and ca-
pable servicemembers, solely due to 
their sexual orientation. 
On December 22, 2010, the Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell Repeal Act was signed into 
law, and the policy officially ended 10 
years ago today. 
As a longtime supporter of repeal, I 
was thrilled when years of advocacy 
and determination paid off in the vic-
tory for dignity and equality. 
LGBTQ servicemembers are an inte-
gral part of our Nation’s defense, and 
they deserve our eternal support and 
gratitude for the sacrifices they make 
every day to keep us safe. 
Please join me in commemorating 
this historic day and in thanking all 
LGBTQ servicemembers and veterans 
for their service to our Nation. 
f 
LIFE IS A PRECIOUS GIFT FROM 
GOD 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, any at-
tack against the sanctity of human life 
tears the moral fabric of this great 
country. 
H.R. 3755, the abortion on demand 
until birth act, is yet another scheme 
levied against the most vulnerable 
group in this country, the unborn. This 
legislation would impose abortion on 
demand for any reason until birth. 
What’s more, it would override past 
and future pro-life laws at both the 
State and Federal levels. 
Madam Speaker, the unborn deserve 
a voice in the people’s House who 
stands for them, and I am proud to be 
one of the many in this body who do so. 
Let us never forget that life is a pre-
cious gift from God, and that gift 
should never be squandered under any 
circumstances. 
f 
REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IS 
NOT FOR THE LAZY OR THE 
FAINT OF HEART 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, in 
1787, Benjamin Franklin was asked 
what type of government our founders 
had created with the U.S. Constitution, 
and his response was: ‘‘A republic, if 
you can keep it.’’ 
Why? Because representative democ-
racy is not for the lazy or the faint of 
heart. American democracy relies upon 
an informed, engaged citizenry. We re-
quire immigrants to pass a difficult 
test when they become citizens, but we 
currently require little to ensure that 
our children are prepared for that role. 
I have been a proponent of civics edu-
cation for my entire life, and it is more 
important 
than 
ever 
to 
help 
our 
schools provide high quality civic edu-
cation. Our young people need to un-
derstand how government works; how 
they can effectively advocate for them-
selves and their communities; and how 
to 
navigate 
the 
masses 
of 
disinformation found online. 
Last Friday, on Constitution Day, I 
introduced a bipartisan bill with Rep-
resentative MEIJER, the Teaching En-
gaged Citizenship Act, to promote 
high-quality, evidence-based civic edu-
cation and service learning programs 
in K–12 public schools. 
Our Constitution has a rich, com-
plicated history. If we want to keep it, 
we need to teach it. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF DWIGHT EMANUELSON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Dwight 
Emanuelson of Hilton Head, South 
Carolina, who sadly passed recently at 
the age of 88. 
Dwight had an impactful career serv-
ing his community. After graduating 
from Cornell University, he began a 
lifelong career as a successful broker 
that brought him to Savannah, Geor-
gia. Although Dwight worked in the fi-
nancial services industry for over 60 
years, his passion for life and love for 
his family is what defined him. 
Dwight also had a lifelong passion for 
art, which he shared generously with 
the Telfair Museum of Art in Savan-
nah. 
When Dwight wasn’t admiring art-
work, he was enjoying the outdoors 
with his children and grandchildren. 
Dwight’s dedication to improving the 
lives of others will never be forgotten. 
I am proud to rise today to honor 
Dwight and his lifetime of service to 
Georgia’s First Congressional District. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time. 
f 
RIGHTING A WRONG 
(Ms. PRESSLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to right a wrong. Shortly 
after his passing, there was an op-ed 
written about Bob Moses which charac-
terized him as ‘‘the most important 
civil rights hero most Americans never 
heard of.’’ I painfully agree. 
Bob Moses has never been given the 
credit he deserved. Fortunately for us, 
his ego was small, but his impact was 
giant. 
Bob Moses was a relentless organizer 
and seeker of justice and equitable ac-
cess to the ballot box as a SNCC orga-
nizer and a transformative educator as 
the founder of the Algebra Project. 
He was a loving husband, father, and 
generous mentor. 
Much like his iconic overalls, Bob 
Moses was unassuming and resilient. 
Days before he transitioned, Moses was 
still fighting, this time for critical 
COVID relief funds to be used to finally 
reinvent the math classroom. 
He said: ‘‘The problem is not the will-
ingness or ability of students to suc-
ceed, rather the systemic inequities 
teachers and students of color face.’’ 
He once posed the question: ‘‘What do 
you do when the country has a sick-
ness?’’ 
I can say, the cure for our Nation’s 
sickness of systemic racism and in-
equality is to model that which Mr. 
Moses demonstrated throughout this 
life. May we honor him now, in a way 
that matters most: Change. 
Rest in power, Mr. Moses.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
150TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
BRAINERD, 
MIN-
NESOTA 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Brainerd, Min-
nesota, a city in my district that is 
celebrating 150 years of culture, his-
tory, and exceptionalism. 
As the weeklong celebration begins 
with festivals and a beautiful park 
dedication, it is important to recognize 
what makes Brainerd so special. 
Located along the mighty Mississippi 
River and surrounded by many of Min-
nesota’s 10,000 lakes, what started out 
as a railroad town has evolved into a 
bustling community where countless 
Americans have chosen to open a busi-
ness, engage in commerce, and recre-
ate. 
While 
Brainerd 
has 
grown 
and 
evolved throughout the past 150 years, 
one thing has always remained the 
same: it is an excellent place to live 
and raise a family. 
As we celebrate 150 years of Brainerd, 
I want to recognize the former and cur-
rent community leaders, business own-
ers, and families who have made this 
community great. I could not be 
prouder to represent this amazing com-
munity in Congress. 
Here is to 150 more years of pros-
perity and excellence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4546 
September 20, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
tonight in support of the Biden admin-
istration’s new guidance regarding the 
Packers 
and 
Stockyards 
Act, 
and 
heartened 
that 
the 
administration 
took swift and decisive action to pro-
tect small farmers and local producers. 
Too often, local farmers suffer eco-
nomically at the expense of large inte-
grators that practice oppressive tactics 
in the marketplace and thwart the 
ability of small producers to flourish. 
The 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
exposed 
great frailties in our food supply 
chains. And while Americans are pay-
ing higher prices, 14 percent on beef, 12 
percent on pork, and 6.6 percent on 
poultry, the country’s top four largest 
meat 
processors 
have 
increasingly 
gained the lion’s share of the market 
since the 1970s. They control the entire 
market, the largest producers. 
Meanwhile, poultry giants Tysons 
and Purdue recently settled a $35 mil-
lion lawsuit in which local contract 
growers cited the combination of low 
wages and the financial demands of 
compliance with the companies’ barn 
standards that unjustly pushed them 
into a debtor’s prison. 
The action taken by the administra-
tion will help smaller farmers stand 
strong, achieve fair contracts, and 
come forward to speak their truth, 
without the fear and threat of retalia-
tion. 
Congratulations to the Biden admin-
istration for doing something that is 
fair and just. 
f 
HIGHLIGHTING THE BENEFITS OF 
HYDROPOWER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
speak tonight about the advocacy and 
the positives we have of hydroelectric 
dams in my home State and in our 
country. They provide hydroelectric 
power, which is green power, which is 
renewable power. Yet, that seems to be 
forgotten these days when they are 
more and more trying to remove hy-
droelectric dams from our grid. 
It is clean power; it is available 24 
hours a day. You don’t have to wait for 
the sun to come up or wind to blow. 
Hydroelectric 
dams 
have 
several 
multiple use purposes, such as storing 
water for people or for agriculture. 
That water is available for dipping out 
of when you have aircraft that need to 
get water supply for fighting forest 
fires like we have over a million acres 
of in my home State, in Northern Cali-
fornia. 
Water transfers can help with the 
wildlife; with helping to have switches 
so that they can have water for aquatic 
species, for swapping during the year. 
So why are we wanting to remove hy-
droelectric dams? 
In California, we even have issues 
with having to shut off power usage, 
what is called flex alerts. What is even 
funnier is that you have shut them off 
from 3 to 9 p.m. on charging your elec-
tric car. 
So we should utilize our hydro-
electric dams and all the multiple posi-
tive uses they have, and not tear them 
out, like on the Klamath Basin. 
f 
HUMANITARIAN HAITIAN 
IMMIGRANT RELIEF 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I want the Haitian community in 
America and in the United States to 
know that we have not forgotten them. 
Haiti has been a strong ally of the 
United States that, unfortunately, has 
been caught in the quagmire of de-
structive poverty and, of course, gov-
ernments that sometimes have not 
worked. Recently, they experienced a 
horrific 
earthquake; 
800,000 
people 
homeless. 
So now that we see Haitians by the 
thousands coming to our border, we 
have an obligation not to deport them. 
We have an obligation to provide the 
potential review that comes about by 
having the number of immigration per-
sonnel to determine their status. We 
have an obligation for humanitarian 
relief. 
I know our borders are closed; I rec-
ognize that. But I also know that there 
is opportunity for asylum through 
credible fear, and there is also an op-
portunity to deal with whether or not 
these individuals have family mem-
bers. 
Let me simply say, Madam Speaker, 
the question we have now is sending 
these Haitians to a country that is so 
impoverished and violent is not the 
right way to go. Let’s work together to 
do it right.

HONORING THE LIVES OF COACH 
GUY THOMAS AND COACH MARK 
MCGARITY 
(Mr. DONALDS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the lives of Coach Guy 
Thomas and Coach Mark McGarity, 
two beloved track and field coaches of 
the Southwest Florida community who 
both passed away on July 13 of this 
year. 
Coach Guy Thomas tragically passed 
away after being hospitalized in crit-
ical 
condition 
after 
contracting 
COVID–19. A track and field coach at 
Dunbar High School, Mr. Thomas dedi-
cated his life to training and men-
toring our young athletes on the field. 
A highly respected coach, Mr. Thomas 
led his team to numerous Lee County 
Athletic Conference wins and coached 
multiple State champions. 
Retired Coach Mark McGarity also 
lost his life to a battle with cancer. Mr. 
McGarity served the Collier County 
community as a coach and teacher for 
38 years, and for 15 years served as the 
cross country and track coach at Lely 
High School. 
I am proud that the State of Florida 
has access to such esteemed and be-
loved educators that allow our youth 
to flourish, both in the classroom and 
on the field. 
As the Representative for Florida’s 
19th Congressional District, it is my 
honor to stand here today celebrating 
the lives of two Americans who dedi-
cated themselves to bettering our 
youth and serving as role models to the 
Southwest Florida community.

HONORING THOSE WHO LOST 
THEIR LIVES IN AFGHANISTAN 
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, to-
night we paid tribute to the 13 fallen 
American military who died as Afghan-
istan was being abandoned by this ad-
ministration to the Taliban, who are 
now more powerful than they have ever 
been, have more equipment than they 
ever had. 
What we didn’t pay tribute to to-
night—it somehow got lost in the shuf-
fle—is over 2,400 of our precious mili-
tary lives that were lost fighting for 
their country in Afghanistan. They 
kept us safe, relatively safe for 20 
years. But they should not be forgot-
ten. 
There are over 1,800 civilian contrac-
tors that were killed. There were 600 
military killed in Afghanistan under 
Commander in Chief Bush; 1,800 under 
Commander in Chief Obama. They 
should not be forgotten. They served 
their country.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,

Caucus represent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4547 
September 20, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it is clear that we will be dealing with 
Build Back Better for the time of this 
week and into next week, so the Con-
gressional Black Caucus will come very 
briefly this week to discuss and let our 
constituents and Americans know that 
any distorted representation of the $3.5 
trillion, as not being able to afford it 
or that it is too extensive, is really a 
misrepresentation. 
First of all, we support, as the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, Build Back 
Better enthusiastically. It is a $3.5 tril-
lion package over 10 years for a coun-
try that is nearing 350 million people, a 
country that has not seen infrastruc-
ture investment, climate investment, 
investment to deal with electric cars, 
investment to deal with the new econ-
omy, the care economy—we have not 
seen this for decades, or at least we 
have not seen this as we have moved 
into the 21st century. 
The Build Back Better plan makes 
the transformative investments that 
we need to continue our growing econ-
omy, lower costs for working families, 
and position the United States as a 
global leader in the innovation and 
jobs of the future. 
The $3.5 trillion gross investment 
will build on the successes of the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan and set our Nation on 
a path of fiscal responsibility and 
broadly shared prosperity for genera-
tions to come. 
Almost 4 years ago, in 2017, the Hous-
ton area and most of the Southern re-
gion, all the way to Florida, including 
some of our Commonwealths, experi-
enced Hurricane Harvey. 
This is my district, where the water 
looked like an extended ocean—$155 
billion worth of damage, so much dam-
age that we are continuing to work 
with it. Why? Because we did not have 
the infrastructure. We did not have the 
bayous that were constructed in a way 
that would hold the water. So much 
damage, so much loss, so much pain. 
So a combination of the INVEST Act 
and Build Back Better is a must. They 
must walk hand-in-hand. One without 
the other does not answer the call of 
the American people. It does not re-
flect the Lincolnesque attitude that we 
all are in this together. 
Let me read a quote from President 
Lincoln, who reminds us so much 
whenever we speak of the idea of what 
America is. Abraham Lincoln, in 1862, 
as he was seeing the divide coming into 
this Nation, offered these words: ‘‘The 
dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The oc-
casion is piled high with difficulty, and 
we must rise with the occasion. As our 
case is new, so we must think anew and 
act anew. We must disenthrall our-
selves, and then we shall save our 
country.’’ 
As we move forward with Build Back 
Better and the INVEST Act, the $3.5 
trillion and the $1 trillion, there is no 
time to isolate ourselves as one or I or 
me. This is a time when we stand with 
America as we, working to ensure that 
this magnificent contribution to the 
infrastructure—to some of the worst 
infrastructure problems, from dams to 
highways to the electric grid—can also 
stand alongside childcare and the care 
economy. 
For example, in the State of Texas, 
this bill would help the local economy. 
It would send more than $400 million in 
Texas to support the expansion of an 
electric vehicle charging network, with 
up 
to 
$2.5 
billion 
more 
available 
through grants. 
Texas would also receive $3 billion to 
improve pipes and the delivery of clean 
drinking water so needed in our State, 
in urban and rural communities. 
And Texas would benefit from the 
bill’s 
$3.5 
billion 
investment 
in 
weatherizing energy grids across the 
country. Millions of Texans who sat 
shivering in their dark living rooms 
during the last winter’s freeze will un-
doubtedly welcome that improvement. 
We lost over 150 people in that short 
span in February when we saw tem-
peratures in Texas that we had never 
imagined. People literally froze in 
their beds. One comes to mind that is 
so emotional: An 11-year-old boy froze 
in his bed in February 2021. 
Critically, the bill would provide at 
least $100 million for broadband access 
in a State where 14 percent of house-
holds don’t have an internet subscrip-
tion, and 4 percent of Texans have no 
broadband infrastructure at all. 
My view is that we cannot simply go 
for one versus the other. Let me just 
tell you about the Build Back Better 
$3.5 trillion bill. 
It will provide childcare to help our 
workforce and contribute to the econ-
omy where that is needed. Therefore, 
the plan supports families in need of 
childcare, providing access to safe, reli-
able, high-quality childcare, delivered 
by well-trained childcare providers. 
As it relates to education, we will be 
productive and having our children 
have high-quality education. That is 
why this plan makes necessary invest-
ments to increase quality education by 
4 years for all students at no cost to 
hardworking parents. The plan will 
provide 2 years of free pre-K and 2 
years of free community college. We 
are investing in people. 
In regard to healthcare, too many 
Americans are forced to choose be-
tween medical care and putting food on 
the table. The plan expands access to 
quality, 
affordable 
healthcare 
by 
strengthening the Medicare, Medicaid, 
and Affordable Care marketplace pro-
grams that millions of Americans rely 
on. But now more could be added, in 
addition to providing dental, hearing, 
and vision benefits. That is when we go 
it together. Not I’s and me’s, but we, us 
together. 
Paid leave that can help us get on 
our feet when we are having issues 
with family and healthcare. 
Tackling the climate crisis. We have 
seen the ravages of hurricanes. We 
have seen Hurricane Ida—devastation 
that is unspeakable, electricity that 
people do not have, a million people 
without electricity. The climate crisis 
and climate change are here. It is cru-
cial that we begin to invest in a plan 
that empowers comprehensive action 
to build an equitable, clean energy 
economy with historic investments to 
transform and modernize the elec-
tricity sector. It is imperative that we 
do that. 
We must take a moment to pause and 
to recognize that any positive steps on 
climate will be because of us, because 
of the most powerful lawmaking body 
in the Nation, taking a moment to 
pause and realistically confronting it, 
providing the research dollars, working 
with universities, such as the Univer-
sity of Houston Energy Institute and 
Texas Southern University, looking at 
ways to provide the best approach to a 
green approach and climate response as 
well as providing the necessary re-
search on new kinds of energy. That is 
what we need to do. 
Just for a moment, may I step back 
to the point about healthcare. We 
know it all too well in Houston. We 
were the poster child in Texas for the 
most uninsured persons when the Af-
fordable Care Act was implemented. 
Six million people, 25 percent of the 
State of Texas, were uninsured. We 
still do not have access to healthcare 
as we should. 
Then to add this horrific burden and 
insult to the women of Texas, to write 
the most heinous bill that would, in 
fact, disallow a woman’s access to 
healthcare, 
this 
horrible 
bill 
that 
would have a bounty hunter that would 
seek to follow you in the midst of you 
getting good healthcare. I think this is 
clearly an unfortunate set of cir-
cumstances that we should correct. 
Healthcare, your own personal deci-
sion with your provider, your faith, and 
your family, choices that no one wants 
to make, yet this State law was put in 
place to create a vigilante community 
to attack women and those that might 
help them provide access to healthcare. 
That is what it is, access to healthcare, 
a decision that no one offers to make 
lightly. But here we are, a vigilante 
being enticed by $10,000—gossip, spy-
ing, standing outside dorm rooms, 
watching Uber cars, standing in front 
of doctors’ offices, standing in front of 
organizations like Planned Parenthood 
that deal with healthcare for women, 
and just plain providing a sense of in-
timidation and fear. 
That brings me to the legislation 
that we hope that we will see passing, 
H.R. 5226, Preventing Vigilante Stalk-
ing that Stops Women’s Access to 
Healthcare and Abortion Rights Act of 
2021. I hope my colleagues will join me 
in a simple bill that simply says you 
don’t have the right to stalk a woman 
who is seeking healthcare. It may be 
that she is going for a mammogram. 
You don’t know. But by creating this

atmosphere of money being given to a 
whole industry of people, ne’er-do-wells 
and others, some with good intentions 
in their mind but seeking to make 
profit on someone else’s pain, that is 
unacceptable. I hope my colleagues 
will join me in that legislation. 
Healthcare is a right, and we should 
give that to families, to women, to 
men, to children, and to seniors. That 
is what building America back better 
will do. 
Affordable housing, helping homeless 
persons, tax cuts for families and work-
ers, I am so grateful. And I want every-
body to know how Democrats worked 
so hard for the child tax credit—excuse 
me, let me correct that—the child tax 
cut. In fact, as I hear it, my constitu-
ents, your constituents, their constitu-
ents, are receiving those child tax cuts 
right now. Many people are making 
ends meet, helping their children get 
into school. 
That is what Democrats do, and that 
is what this bill is going to do—re-
search, development, and innovation 
on good, forward-thinking infrastruc-
ture. 
Working with HBCUs, helping them 
be historically relevant but also help-
ing them to be stronger in terms of 
their infrastructure. I support that and 
thank one of our colleagues, Congress-
woman ALMA ADAMS, who has been a 
leader on making sure our HBCUs are 
front and center, are surviving. These 
are our historic colleges founded in the 
1800s. 
b 2000 
Immigration, of course, is a very im-
portant issue, and I might say, another 
issue that we worked on in the Judici-
ary Committee with our allotment of 
$107 billion, and that is, of course, com-
munity violence intervention. We put 
in $2.5 billion on community violence 
intervention. And that of course was 
$107 billion, $107.5 billion in Judiciary. 
Part of that, of course, was to deal 
with the issue of community violence 
intervention. 
So you can see there is no time to 
waste. There is no time to delay. There 
is only time to work hard on getting 
this legislation passed. We must do it 
as an INVEST Act, we must do it as a 
budget reconciliation, or the Build 
Back Better Act of 2021, the better 
name. We must do it together. 
The 
Congressional 
Black 
Caucus 
stands to be able to say, ‘‘No more Hur-
ricane Harveys,’’ but more, work with 
communities, rebuilding streets, his-
toric preservation, and making a dif-
ference. That is what historic infra-
structure investment can do, and that 
is what we in the Congressional Black 
Caucus stand for. 
I look forward to us continuing our 
discussion. Madam Speaker, I take the 
opportunity at this point in the name 
of unity, reconciliation, a new pathway 
for transformational government, pass-
ing of the INVEST Act, passing of the 
Build Back Better Act, and making 
sure that we have voting rights, that 
we give women the right to choose, 
that we pass H.R. 40, the commission to 
study slavery and develop reparation 
proposals. A long agenda. I know that 
we can do this in the spirit of unity. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, and the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, I am pleased to co-an-
chor this Congressional Black Caucus Special 
Order with my colleague, the distinguished 
gentleman from New York, Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES. 
I thank the Chair of the CBC, Congress-
woman BEATTY of Ohio, for organizing this 
Special Order to discuss the reasons why the 
CBC strong supports the Build Back Better 
Agenda conceived and advanced by President 
Biden and House Democrats to support vision-
ary and transformative investments in the 
health, well-being, and financial security of 
America’s workers and families. 
Over the next hour, several of our col-
leagues will share their perspectives on why it 
is essential that we ‘‘go big’’ in building back 
better to our nation and all of its people have 
the opportunities and resources to compete 
and win in the changing global economy of the 
21st century. 
Madam Speaker, it is often said that the 
federal budget is an expression of the nation’s 
values and the investments made to Build 
America Back Better are a clear declaration of 
congressional Democrats’ commitment to en-
suring that our government, our economy, and 
our systems work For The People. 
Madam Speaker, these long-overdue invest-
ments in America’s future will be felt in every 
corner of the country and across every sector 
of American life, building on the success of 
the American Rescue Plan, accommodating 
historic infrastructure investments in the legis-
lative pipeline, and addressing longstanding 
deficits in our communities by ending an era 
of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge 
from our current crises a stronger, more equi-
table nation. 
Should our friends across the aisle join us 
in this endeavor, it would send a powerful sig-
nal to the American people if our colleagues 
across the aisle would join us in this effort be-
cause nothing would better show them that 
their elected representatives can set partisan-
ship aside and put America first. 
And that bipartisan achievement would por-
tend success for similar initiatives in the area 
of strengthening the infrastructure of democ-
racy in which every American has a vital inter-
est, national and homeland security, and crimi-
nal justice and immigration reform. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor Jim 
Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully 
several months ago: 
At this point in time in this nation, we 
need to go big. We need to quit counting the 
egg-sucking legs on the cows and count the 
cows and just move. And move forward and 
move right now. 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion 
is piled high with difficulty, and we must 
rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so 
we must think anew and act anew. We must 
disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save 
our country. 
Madam Speaker, the bipartisan action we 
took in February 2021 when we passed the 
American Rescue Plan was a giant step in the 
right direction, but it was a targeted response 
to the immediate and urgent public health and 
economic crises; it was not a long-term solu-
tion to many of the pressing challenges facing 
our nation that have built up over decades of 
disinvestment in our nation and its people in 
every region and sector of the country. 
We simply can no longer afford the costs of 
neglect and inaction; the time to act is now. 
The Build Back Better Plan makes the 
transformative investments that we need to 
continue growing our economy, lower costs for 
working families, and position the United 
States as a global leader in innovation and the 
jobs of the future. 
This $3.5 trillion gross investment will build 
on the successes of the American Rescue 
Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal re-
sponsibility and broadly shared prosperity for 
generations to come. 
The Build Back Better Plan will provide re-
sources to improve our education, health, and 
child care systems, invest in clean energy and 
sustainability, address the housing crisis, and 
more; all while setting America up to compete 
and win in the decades ahead. 
The Build Back Better Plan is paid for by 
ensuring that the wealthy and big corporations 
are paying their fair share and Americans 
making less than $400,000 a year will not see 
their taxes increase by a penny. 
Let me repeat that: No American making 
less than $400,000 a year will not see their 
taxes increase by a penny. 
In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments 
made by the Build Back Better Plan will ex-
pand opportunity for all and build an economy 
powered by shared prosperity and inclusive 
growth. 
No one is better prepared or more experi-
enced to lead the American renaissance that 
will be produced by the investments made by 
the Build Back Better Plan than President 
Biden, the architect of the American Rescue 
Plan and who as Vice-President during the 
Obama Administration oversaw the implemen-
tation of the Recovery Act, which saved mil-
lions of jobs and rescued our economy from 
the Great Recession the nation inherited from 
a previous Republican administration. 
And let us not forget that President Obama 
also placed his confidence in his vice-presi-
dent to oversee the rescue of the automotive 
industry, which he did so well that the Amer-
ican car industry fully recovered its status as 
the world leader. 
Madam Speaker, let me briefly highlight 
some of the key investments made by the 
Build Back Better Plan: 
EDUCATION 
The Plan will provide two years of free pre- 
K and two years of free community college to 
ensure every student has the tools, resources, 
and opportunity to succeed in life. 
It will also invest in our teachers and institu-
tions that serve minority students and provide 
funding to give school buildings long-overdue 
infrastructure updates. 
Children lead happier, healthier, and more 
productive lives when they have had access to 
high-quality education and that is why the

H4549 
September 20, 2021 
Build Back Better Plan makes necessary in-
vestments to increase quality education by 
four years for all students at no cost to hard-
working families. 
HEALTH CARE 
The Build Back Better Plan expands access 
to quality, affordable health care by strength-
ening the Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable 
Care Act (ACA) Marketplace programs that 
millions of Americans already rely on. 
It includes a major new expansion of Medi-
care benefits, adding a dental, hearing, and vi-
sion benefit to the program for the very first 
time. 
It strengthens the ACA by extending the en-
hanced Marketplace subsidies that were in-
cluded in the American Rescue Plan. 
It also provides an affordable coverage op-
tion for the more than two million Americans 
living in states that have not expanded Med-
icaid under the ACA and do not earn enough 
to qualify for Marketplace subsidies. 
The Build Back Better Plan’s investment in 
home- and community-based services will in-
crease access to critical services and create 
new and better-paying jobs for care providers. 
When the Build Back Better Plan is fully im-
plemented soon gone will be the terrible old 
days when too many Americans are forced to 
choose between medical care and putting food 
on the table or affording other necessities. 
CHILD CARE 
The Build Back Better Plan supports fami-
lies in need of child care by providing access 
to safe, reliable, and high-quality care deliv-
ered by a well-trained child care workforce. 
This is important because our nation is 
strongest when everyone can join the work-
force and contribute to the economy. 
That is why this investment is vital to so 
many millions of—especially women—who are 
often forced to choose between working to 
support their family or caring for their family. 
PAID LEAVE 
Madam Speaker, the United States is the 
richest nation in the world but one of the few 
modern democracies that lacks a paid leave 
program. 
The Build Back Better Plan remedies this 
shameful failing by creating a national, com-
prehensive paid family and medical leave pro-
gram, providing direct support to workers and 
families. 
This crucial investment will allow workers to 
take the time they need to bond with a new 
child, care for their own serious illness, or care 
for a seriously ill loved one without risking 
needed income or employment. 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
In the area of housing, the Build Back Better 
Plan makes investments to ensure that Ameri-
cans have access to safe and affordable 
housing by providing resources to increase 
housing vouchers and funding for tribal hous-
ing. 
It also supports investments in programs 
that will help address our nation’s housing cri-
sis by increasing the supply of affordable 
homes for those in need and investing in his-
torically underserved communities and those 
that have been previously left behind. 
TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE 
The Build Back Better Plan will spur and 
empower comprehensive action to build an 
equitable clean energy economy with historic 
investments to transform and modernize the 
electricity sector, lower energy costs for Amer-
icans, improve air quality and public health, 
create good-paying jobs, and strengthen U.S. 
competitiveness—all while putting our country 
on the pathway to 100 percent carbon-free 
electricity by 2035. 
The Build Back Better Plan extends and ex-
pands clean energy tax credits and supports 
clean electricity performance payments so util-
ities can accelerate progress toward a clean 
electric grid at no added cost to consumers. 
The Build Back Better Plan invests in clean 
energy, efficiency, electrification, and climate 
justice through grants, consumer rebates, and 
federal procurement of clean power and sus-
tainable materials, and by incentivizing private 
sector development and investment. 
Another exciting aspect of the Build Back 
Better Plan, Madam Speaker, is that it will 
drive economic opportunities, environmental 
conservation, and climate resilience—espe-
cially in underserved and disadvantaged com-
munities—including through a new Civilian Cli-
mate Corps. 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND INNOVATION 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Madam Speaker, advances in science, tech-
nology, and manufacturing are creating the in-
dustries and jobs of the future, and we must 
ensure that they are created here. 
That is why the Build Back Better Plan in-
vests in America’s ingenuity and competitive-
ness by revitalizing state-of-the-art laboratory 
facilities and research across the nation, in-
cluding at historically black colleges and uni-
versities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving 
institutions (MSIs), through new regional inno-
vation hubs, and through federal science 
agencies. 
The Build Back Better Plan will reinvigorate 
U.S. manufacturing by supporting supply chain 
resilience and modernization, Manufacturing 
USA institutes, the Manufacturing Extension 
Partnership, and facilities and research at the 
National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology, all of which will strengthen America’s 
competitiveness in the global economy. 
IMMIGRATION 
Madam Speaker, as virtually every re-
spected study has concluded, providing a 
pathway to lawful permanent resident (LPR) 
status for Dreamers, recipients of Temporary 
Protected Status (TPS), farmworkers, and es-
sential workers will be a boon for our econ-
omy. 
This Plan allows for investments to provide 
a pathway to LPR status for these immigrant 
communities. 
Madam Speaker, immigrants eligible for 
such protection are an integral part of Texas’s 
social fabric. 
Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who 
are eligible for protection, 112,000 of whom 
reside in Harris County. 
These individuals live with 845,300 family 
members and among those family members, 
178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children. 
These persons in Texas who are eligible for 
protection under the bill arrived in the United 
States at the average age of 8 and on aver-
age have lived in the United States since 
1996. 
They own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay 
$340,500,000 in annual mortgage payments 
and contribute $2,234,800,000 in federal taxes 
and $1,265,200,000 in state and local taxes 
each year. 
Annually, 
these 
households 
generate 
$10,519,000,000 in spending power in Texas 
and help power the national economy. 
TAX CUTS FOR FAMILIES AND WORKERS 
The expansion of the Child Tax Credit 
(CTC) enacted in the American Rescue Plan 
has already benefitted nearly 66 million chil-
dren, put money in the pockets of millions of 
hard-working parents and guardians, and is 
expected to help cut child poverty by more 
than half. 
The Build Back Better Plan not only extends 
this meaningful tax cut, but it also extends the 
expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) 
and the expanded Child and Dependent Care 
Tax Credit, which help families make ends 
meet and put food on the table, reduce child 
poverty, and lessen the burden on hard-work-
ing Americans so they can provide a better fu-
ture for America’s children. 
REINING IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
The Build Back Better Plan also achieves 
savings from following through on President 
Biden’s call to give Medicare the power to ne-
gotiate lower prescription drug prices, saving 
money for patients as well as the federal gov-
ernment. 
Madam Speaker, we have before us a once 
in a century opportunity to make gigantic 
progress in making ours a more perfect union, 
and to do it in a single bound with enactment 
of the Build Back Better Plan, the most trans-
formative legislation passed by this Congress 
since the Great Society and the New Deal. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I’d like to thank Chairwoman BEATTY and the 
Congressional Black Caucus for hosting this 
Special Order Hour on our priorities in the 
budget reconciliation and infrastructure nego-
tiation processes, and thank Congresswoman 
JACKSON LEE and Congressman TORRES for 
facilitating it. 
First, let me be very clear: I am certainly no 
fan of the partisanship and complexity associ-
ated with the reconciliation process. In an 
ideal world, in a perfect situation, this process 
would be defined by bipartisan agreements 
and give-and-take, and would be negotiated in 
a gradual, more transparent manner. But we 
do not live in an ideal world, nor is this a per-
fect situation. Right now, as we stand here 
today, millions of Americans are suffering, our 
infrastructure is crumbling, and our planet is 
quite literally on fire. 
Now, Madam Speaker, I have served in this 
body for nearly 30 years—but I find myself 
struggling to recall a time when the cost of in-
action was as high and as dangerous as it is 
in this moment. That’s why the Black Caucus, 
under the leadership of Chairwoman BEATTY, 
has fought to include vital provisions in the 
Build Back Better Act that would transform our 
economy and infrastructure, provide relief from 
Americans still reeling from the effects of 
COVID–19, and form a blueprint for a more 
equitable, just society. 
It’s why I, as a Senior Member of the House 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, 
voted to pass the portion of the Build Back 
Better Act dealing with investments in our na-
tion’s transportation and infrastructure sys-
tems. The most salient, underlying themes 
contained in the bill include investments in a 
race equitable transportation system, climate 
resiliency, transit programs targeted to resi-
dents in disadvantaged communities, re-
sources for railroads, port infrastructure and 
supply chain resilience, and our water infra-
structure, to name a few. 
It’s why I, as Chair of the House Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee, presided

over a markup of the portion of the Build Back 
Better Act dealing with the issues and agen-
cies under our jurisdiction. We targeted giving 
our nation’s scientists and engineers 21st cen-
tury facilities to conduct research by investing 
billions of dollars into research infrastructure at 
the National Science Foundation, the Depart-
ment of Energy, the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology, and the National 
Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 
Administration. 
These vital investments will also lead to good, 
high-paying jobs. We also invested billions of 
dollars into our innovation pipeline at our pre-
mier research agencies to power our research 
and development and our advanced manufac-
turing programs. This includes significant in-
vestments in minority-serving institutions and 
diversity programs at NSF and DOE. Finally, 
we funded billions of dollars to better under-
stand and respond to the climate crisis. In-
cluded in this is vital funding to improve our 
understanding of climate-associated natural 
disasters 
like 
hurricanes, 
flooding, 
and 
wildfires. 
Madam Speaker, I would urge all of my col-
leagues—Republican and Democrat, progres-
sive and conservative, and everyone in be-
tween—to support these critical, much-needed 
investments in our constituents, in our dis-
tricts, and in our country as a whole. 
f 
THREE IMPORTANT ISSUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we are back from our August break, 
and there are three issues of tremen-
dous importance that Congress ought 
to deal with and the press corps ought 
to be dealing with. 
I can understand, by the way, why 
President Biden wants to change his 
view over a few months ago and go for 
mandates on the vaccine, because these 
other issues are issues that I am sure 
would be uncomfortable for him to ad-
dress, but they are important for the 
press corps and important for the 
American people to address. 
The first issue is: the Del Rio sector 
of the Mexican border is out of control. 
We all see the 15,000 people under the 
bridge, but what is the consequence of 
that? 
What is the consequence of having 2 
months in a row of over 200,000 people 
show up at the border? The Border Pa-
trol has to get off the border, they have 
to shuffle people around from the Del 
Rio section to the El Paso section or to 
the Laredo section. They have to take 
care of all of the unaccompanied mi-
nors coming in here, and when they do 
that, they cannot guard the border. 
Things are out of control. 
Not only are the agents in that area 
not able to focus on the area, but 
things are such a disaster, we are hav-
ing to bring agents off the northern 
border to make up for the huge prob-
lems on the southern border. 
What happens? We wind up in a situa-
tion which not only are there more 
got-aways, people aren’t even being 
processed crossing the border, but we 
also have a situation in which more 
drugs are coming off the border. The 
American public still hasn’t been told 
enough that in the last year we have 
had over 90,000 people die of drug 
overdoses, largely from fentanyl com-
ing across the Mexican border, and 
that is what happens when you have 224 
miles barely monitored. 
The Haitians are being brought here 
or encouraged to come here by the drug 
gangs. Why are they able to do this? It 
didn’t happen by coincidence that you 
saw all these people under the bridge 
last week and they weren’t over there 
a month ago. 
The Biden administration has ex-
tended the Temporary Protected Sta-
tus for people coming here from Haiti. 
When they changed this process, it was 
a recruiting tool for the gangs who 
want more people to come here. 
I am going to emphasize, Haiti is not 
a very nice country, but these people 
are not coming from Haiti. They are 
coming here from Chile, they are com-
ing here from Brazil, they are coming 
from Venezuela. Why are they coming 
from these other countries? It is not 
because they are in danger in Chile and 
Brazil. They are coming here because 
they can make more money here, and 
the drug cartel gangs are explaining 
that to them. 
These gangs are charging these Hai-
tians at least $50,000 a person to come 
here, which is the reason why they are 
so involved in this. 
Meanwhile, where is the President? 
Where is our moderate Joe Biden? 
Where is Kamala Harris, the expert on 
the border, as we have this disaster 
going on at the southern border, out of 
control, people going from the United 
States to Mexico, back Mexico to the 
United States? 
Wake up, press corps, and find out 
how much money the gangs are making 
on this. Why are we processing over 
200,000 people at the southern border 
for 2 months in a row? Things we 
haven’t seen for over 20 years. 
No wonder some of the press corps, 
the irresponsible press corps—and no 
wonder Joe Biden wants to focus on 
vaccine mandates. Because focusing on 
vaccine mandates takes our eyes off 
the border that is out of control. 
It is up to Congress to step forward, 
have some more committee hearings 
on this, do something, bring some bills 
to the floor. I know there is going to be 
a CR coming through, there is going to 
be a bill to break the debt ceiling com-
ing through. 
I would ask the President, the Speak-
er, give us some more Border Patrol 
agents to deal with our empty border. 
That is the first thing all Americans 
should 
be 
concerned 
about. 
They 
should be asking their Congressmen, 
they should be asking their Senators, 
what is being done to prevent 200,000 
people from showing up at the border? 
What is being done when over 200 miles 
of the Mexican border is left, to a de-
gree, unguarded? Are they at all con-
cerned about the 90,000 people who died 
in the last year of illegal drug use, pri-
marily fentanyl flowing across the 
southern border? What is being done 
about all the people coming from the 
other countries? 
Remember, you did not see all these 
people under the bridge 2 or 3 months 
ago. Why? Again, it is not just a ran-
dom thing. It is because of a change in 
the Temporary Protected Status ex-
tended by President Biden, which re-
sults in the huge mess that we have. 
But that is not the only thing that 
hasn’t been covered anywhere near 
enough. There is an issue that the press 
should be focusing on more with regard 
to the COVID situation. I know a lot of 
the focus is on the vaccine, but we have 
to realize that many people have got-
ten the vaccine over the last 6 months. 
We also have a situation in which 
people have been working on cures for 
the disease. Right now, most days over 
1,000—kind of averaging about 1,500— 
people die every day from COVID. So is 
there any cure for COVID that the CDC 
is letting sit on the table? 
Over a year ago scientists in Israel 
announced hope for a generic drug 
called fenofibrate, or Tricor, which has 
been used safely to treat people for 
high cholesterol for years. Recently, 
these Israeli scientists have revealed 
that they took 15 people, all of which 
had severe COVID, all of which needed 
oxygen, and in 4 days, 4 to 6 days, 14 of 
the 15 were out of the hospital after 
they were given fenofibrate, which cost 
a grand total of $1.50 a day. The other 
patient got out of the hospital within 2 
weeks. 
You would think this is good news for 
the CDC, particularly given the billions 
of dollars that we have given them. Un-
fortunately, 
they 
are 
not 
getting 
enough assistance to do further trials 
in this country. Think if this 15-patient 
outfit were typical of the population as 
a whole. 15 for 15 cured. And not only 
cured. A lot of people today with 
COVID, even when they are cured, have 
permanent or almost permanent side 
effects. But here the side effects are a 
fraction of what they were on people 
who didn’t take fenofibrate. 
So I beg the CDC or anybody in the 
administration who is listening, we 
brought this to their attention before, 
see what you can do to have the vast 
sum of money and the U.S. Govern-
ment weigh in to see if we can have 
stronger trials with more people on the 
fenofibrate, and we can get ourselves in 
a position in which soon if someone 
does wind up going to the hospital, if 
someone does wind up needing oxygen, 
they are given the fenofibrate, and 
they can wind up like the 15 patients 
they have already tried this on, all of 
which are apparently doing very well 
and are even getting rid of the symp-
toms that people who have had COVID 
sometimes hang onto for months and 
months and months. 
If we have anybody out there listen-
ing from the CDC, listening from the

NIH, I would ask them to familiarize 
themselves 
with 
the 
study. 
It 
is 
fenofibrate. It has been well covered in 
The Jerusalem Post. 
Why, in a time when we have 1,200 to 
1,500 Americans dying every day of 
COVID, is this not something that is 
being pushed? I strongly encourage our 
health establishment to familiarize 
themselves with what right now looks 
like a miracle drug. 
My final comment is with regard to 
the pro-life issue. When you consider 
the hundreds of thousands of people 
who would have been born every day in 
this country but who have their lives 
cut short before they are born, you can 
see why this is another issue that our 
press corps should be talking about, 
our churches should be talking about. 
Already there have been big changes 
of policy under the new administra-
tion. First of all, in the past, under the 
Mexico City policy, if money was going 
to an international organization, if 
that international organization was 
performing abortions, they could not 
have the money. We changed that, 
President Biden changed it, saying: 
You can’t use that money directly for 
an abortion, but since money is fun-
gible, your organization can take the 
good name of the United States and use 
it to proselytize, use it after switching 
money around to have the U.S. assist 
in performing abortions around the 
world. 
The second thing they did is under 
Title X, money going out, again to 
nonprofit organizations, in the past if 
these organizations referred for abor-
tion, they couldn’t get the money. 
Change that policy, so the type of orga-
nizations who work towards legalizing 
or work towards normalizing abortion 
got more money. 
They wouldn’t get the money in the 
past because it was too much a part of 
their mission to perform abortions. But 
one more time, they are going to be 
getting money. 
But now we have a new bill coming 
up, and I think all Americans have to 
stop and think what is happening when 
it has come to this in America. 
This bill will legalize abortion na-
tionwide almost or perhaps all the way 
to birth. Now, throughout most of our 
country’s history, abortion was illegal. 
It is kind of amazing, abortion was ille-
gal before they had ultrasounds, before 
people could see actually what was 
going on. 
I had felt when I began to get in-
volved 
in 
public 
life 
that 
when 
ultrasounds 
become 
available, 
the 
number of abortions would drop. But 
despite the ultrasounds, things con-
tinue on ahead, in part because power-
ful organizations continue to hold 
abortion as a way out of a pregnancy. 
But it is truly shocking that I believe 
a majority of people in this Chamber 
are going to vote to say that we have 
abortions right up to birth and get rid 
of even minor laws that are postponing 
the abortions otherwise. 
b 2015 
When I was in the State of Wisconsin, 
I authored a bill putting in a 24-hour 
waiting period for abortion. I talked to 
the women who were bullied by their 
boyfriends or cajoled by their parents 
into having abortions, and they felt it 
was very important that there be some 
sort of waiting period after you went to 
the office of the abortionist one time 
that you got a chance to stop, step 
back, and think. 
I think there are a lot of other places 
in our society where doctors or other 
people put a waiting period out there 
knowing that it is a very important de-
cision, and you are never going to be 
able to change your mind once you 
make that decision. But under the ex-
treme bill that we are going to be vot-
ing on later this week, they are going 
to say, no, we can’t have that. Once 
they get you in that clinic on day one 
they can perform that abortion right 
away, and we are not going to give you 
24 hours or 40 hours or whatever it is 
around the country to stop and maybe 
change your mind. 
That is the type of thing that is 
going to be passed in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. 
It doesn’t take many people to 
change their mind and say, you know, 
I may consider myself so-called pro- 
choice, but the idea of saying that it is 
legal to perform an abortion a few 
hours after you walk in the abortion 
clinic, I just can’t go that far. And I 
hope some of my colleagues who think 
they are going to vote for the bill later 
this week change their mind. 
I hope they change their mind on 
things like sex selective abortion. We 
know in other cultures, and I happen to 
think we have a better culture by a 
mile, but in other cultures it is appar-
ently not unusual to do, see whether 
they are going to have a boy or girl and 
if it is not what you want, we are going 
to end the life of that child before it is 
born. 
Some States have made that illegal. 
Well, some people in Congress appar-
ently feel they know better. We are 
going get rid of that law, and we are 
going to cut that life short just be-
cause maybe let’s say it is a girl, and 
we were hoping for a boy. 
I can see why certain members of the 
press wouldn’t want to talk about this, 
and I can see why certain members of 
the administration wouldn’t talk about 
this. I don’t know what I would do, how 
I would explain such a radical bill. 
So, in any event, I will leave the pub-
lic with those three things to think 
about. Think about over 200,000 people 
a month at the border. Think about the 
Border Patrol stuck processing people, 
not able to monitor the border. Think 
of all the drugs coming across. Think 
of the 5,000 and up that the people com-
ing across are having to give these 
drug gangs in Mexico further strength-
ening their power. 
I ask you to think about like they 
have covered in the Jerusalem Post 
what is going on with the fenofibrate 
and the fact you can think how many 
lives we would save of the approxi-
mately 1,500 people a day that are still 
dying of COVID. And I want you to 
think about that bill being passed on 
Friday and whether it is right for the 
heavy hand of Congress to say not only 
can you have an abortion up to birth, 
but we are even going to get rid of laws 
like a waiting period law or get rid of 
laws like a sex selective law. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair and not to a per-
ceived viewing audience. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
DON’T 
ASK, 
DON’T 
TELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
TAKANO) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and to include ex-
traneous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, to-
day’s Special Order hour marks the 10- 
year anniversary of the enactment of 
the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 
2010. This legislation represented the 
end of an era, the close of a dark chap-
ter in our military history in which 
LGBTQ members of the Armed Forces 
were forced to hide who they were 
under the threat of investigation and 
discharge. 
Lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, and queer servicemembers 
of that era paid a heavy cost to serve 
their country, one that required them 
to uphold an uncompromising oath of 
integrity while at the same time pub-
licly denying a fundamental aspect of 
their lives. It is thanks to their resil-
ience, their strength, and their activ-
ism that repeal was ever achieved, and 
we honor those veterans today. 
I believe it is important to hear from 
the veterans themselves from those 
who served and survived Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell. It is my pleasure this 
evening to welcome a number of my 
colleagues to the floor to read the tes-
timony of five individuals who served 
under Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. 
It is my distinct privilege to start 
with the testimony of Lindsay Church, 
a Navy veteran who served from 2008 to 
2012. Lindsay is a third-generation sail-
or and the sixth in their family to 
serve in the military. They are a co-
founder and executive director of the 
veteran serving organization Minority 
Veterans of America and have nearly a 
decade of experience in veterans advo-
cacy. And this is Lindsay’s story:

September 20, 2021 
‘‘In 2008, I joined the Navy where I 
would serve for 4 years before being 
medically retired. I served all but 3 
months of my time under the mili-
tary’s discriminatory Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell policy. I could tell you a lot of sto-
ries that range from bullying and rep-
rimand for my nonbinary appearance, 
failed relationships due to the fact that 
I had to hide them at every turn, and 
exploitation by other servicemembers 
threatening to tell my secret if I didn’t 
continue to date them. Even as I spent 
months recovering from life-changing 
injuries as a result of my service, I was 
made to suffer alone because my rela-
tionships were legally prohibited. 
‘‘As I have unpacked my service as a 
veteran, I look back at the intense 
scars that Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell in-
flicted on my life. In conversations 
with other Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell sur-
vivors, I have come to realize that 
serving under this policy has left a gen-
eration of queer servicemembers with 
intense trauma and a fracture of our 
identities. For veterans like myself, we 
were often faced with a choice upon 
leaving the military and coming to the 
veteran community: Be a veteran or be 
queer because you can’t be both here. 
‘‘It has taken me nearly a decade 
since leaving the service to find heal-
ing and engage in healthy relation-
ships. I couldn’t speak out against this 
policy when I was in uniform, so it is 
imperative for me today to remind this 
body that policies like Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell cause widespread trauma 
and harm to generations of service-
members who fought for our country 
but were forced to remain voiceless. 
Moral injury will follow with each of us 
for the rest of our lives. 
‘‘My story of service was tarnished 
by Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. Every day I 
carried a lie while attempting to live 
up to the Navy’s core values of honor, 
courage, and commitment. I am deeply 
proud of the years of my life I gave to 
serving my country, and that will 
never change. The scars I carry as a re-
sult of that service will also never 
change. Though they may fade, they 
will never be forgotten.’’ 
So I would like to extend my deep 
thanks to Lindsay, both for their serv-
ice and the courage to share their 
story. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE), chair of the Congressional 
Equality Caucus. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, it is a great honor 
to be part of this Special Order hour, 
and I thank Chairman TAKANO, who is 
not only a leader in the Equality Cau-
cus but also chair of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee for organizing our 
Special Order hour. 
I know we are joined by several other 
members of our caucus, including one 
of our new members, an extraordinary 
gentleman from New Hampshire, CHRIS 
PAPPAS, who we will hear from in just 
a moment. 
As chair of the LGBTQ-Plus Equality 
Caucus. I am very proud to be here to-
night to stand alongside my colleagues 
as we mark this very important anni-
versary. 
Ten years ago, a, historic wrong was 
corrected when Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell 
was repealed. I wish I could say it is 
hard to remember when members of 
the LGBTQ community had to push for 
their right to serve our country openly. 
But we continue to struggle for full 
equality in our military and in many 
other areas of our lives. 
A few years ago, President Trump 
imposed a ban on transgender people 
serving their country in the military. 
Thankfully, President Biden reversed 
that move and just in the past days his 
administration has taken additional 
steps to ensure equal access to services 
for those unfairly discharged. 
Thousands of members of the LGBTQ 
community have served and continue 
to serve in our Nation’s military, and 
we are grateful for their service. We 
understand that military service is in-
herently stressful and dangerous, and 
those who serve are heroes for putting 
themselves in harm’s way to protect us 
all. 
Now imagine conducting that service 
knowing that your very identity must 
be kept hidden at the risk of being 
thrown out with a dishonorable dis-
charge. And we know that LGBTQ serv-
icemembers had more to fear than sep-
aration. They had to face discrimina-
tion and potentially violence within 
their ranks should their identity be 
known. 
The problems facing LGBTQ service-
members did not vanish immediately 
upon repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. I 
am proud of my colleagues who con-
tinue to push to create a level playing 
field for those discharged under this 
discriminatory policy. I particularly 
want 
to 
acknowledge 
Congressman 
TAKANO and Congressman POCAN. But 
there is still more work to be done, and 
the LGBTQ-Plus Equality Caucus is 
committed to continuing this fight 
alongside those who have served. 
Today, as Chairman TAKANO
men-
tioned, my colleagues and I will read 
some firsthand accounts from people 
discharged under Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell 
so the American people can really un-
derstand the story of their lives. 
My story is from John Hegwood, who 
served in the Army and identifies as a 
gay, bi-racial cisgender man. 
He writes: ‘‘I joined the military 
knowing, at least intellectually, that I 
couldn’t be my authentic self. How-
ever, it would take several years of 
introspection to realize what impact 
this would have on my life. I told my-
self it would be easy to navigate as a 
gay man since I grew up in the very 
rural and antigay western part of 
Texas. I thought this would be a pro-
verbial ‘walk in the park.’ 
‘‘When I first heard that Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell would be repealed, I was in-
credulous and nearly in tears. It was 
almost unimaginable that this would 
occur within my lifetime. My then- 
partner and I were both military and 
couldn’t even acknowledge our rela-
tionship in the workplace. The darker 
side of this otherwise heartening news 
is that the coming months until it was 
fully repealed would feel like an even 
more hostile environment. 
‘‘With Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell as the 
status quo for over a decade, I had the 
privilege of mostly flying under the 
radar of most of my colleagues who 
deemed LGBTQ soldiers as a benign 
part of the fighting force. Now with the 
repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell at the 
forefront of the military’s collective 
consciousness, it all but painted a tar-
get on my back as I became the focus 
of everyone’s ire if they disagreed with 
the repeal that was looming on the ho-
rizon. 
‘‘I now carry with me a sense of re-
sentment towards the military because 
of the harassment, hazing, bullying, 
and discrimination I encountered while 
serving from those that I was supposed 
to trust my life with. I had to choose 
between serving my country and my 
relationship. 
‘‘Now, we might have made some 
progress as a society. Last month I 
celebrated 10 wonderful years with that 
same man I couldn’t even acknowledge 
in the workplace 10 years ago. He is 
now my husband, and the military that 
would have discharged him a decade 
ago now honors our marriage and was 
very accommodating in granting a 
compassionate reassignment of duty 
location when I was diagnosed with 
stage III non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 
‘‘This doesn’t mean that homophobia 
simply disappeared, or that everyone 
suddenly had no issues with us simply 
existing as we are. To this day it is not 
entirely safe for us to hold hands in 
public, and members of the LGBTQ 
community are still facing discrimina-
tion in our Armed Forces and in soci-
ety as a whole.’’ 
Madam Speaker, those words power-
fully written are really a call to action 
as we celebrate 10 years of the repeal of 
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell to recognize we 
have much more work to do to ensure 
that all members of the LGBTQ com-
munity can live full lives free from dis-
crimination of any kind. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative CICILLINE
for 
that testimony that he read on behalf 
of John Hegwood, former Army service-
member. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
Hampshire 
(Mr. 
PAPPAS) to share the story of Air Force 
veteran Landon Marchant. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding and 
for his leadership on the Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs and for his long-
standing commitment to fighting for 
those who have served all of us. 
So today does mark the 10th anniver-
sary of the end of Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell. It was a deeply flawed, deeply 
prejudiced policy of our government 
that 
prohibited 
LGBTQ 
individuals

from serving openly in the Armed 
Forces. 
b 2030 
The policy told LGBTQ individuals 
that they were not welcome to serve 
their country, that their government 
viewed them as second-class citizens. 
It also forced many who swore an 
oath to give everything for their coun-
try, up to and including their lives, to 
hide who they were and to live in se-
cret or to face the loss of a job, a life’s 
calling, financial security, health, and 
happiness. 
Americans who were ready, willing, 
and eager to serve their country were 
forced to leave the armed services for 
good, many receiving less-than-honor-
able discharges. It is estimated that 
over 13,000 servicemembers were dis-
charged in the 17 years that Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell was enforced. 
A decade after its repeal, Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell still casts a long, dark, and 
disgraceful shadow and haunts those 
who were targeted. We have much more 
work to do to correct this tremendous 
injustice endured by those who served 
and were discharged during Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell. 
That is why I was proud to introduce 
the Securing the Rights our Veterans 
Earned Act, or SERVE Act, to help 
correct these injustices and guaran-
teeing VA benefits for LGBTQ-plus vet-
erans forced out of service for being 
themselves. This includes veterans who 
were 
discharged 
under 
Don’t 
Ask, 
Don’t Tell, those issued so-called blue 
discharges during World War II, as well 
as those forced out under the Trump’s 
administration discriminatory policy 
on transgender servicemembers. 
I want to highlight one story of a 
courageous veteran, Landon Marchant. 
Landon Marchant is a transgender vet-
eran of the Air Force who enlisted to 
serve their country and for the promise 
of a better life. But after just 22 
months, they were dishonorably dis-
charged. 
As Landon writes: ‘‘The impact of 
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell did not end when 
I received my discharge paperwork, and 
it did not end when the ban was finally 
repealed. It has impacted my post-mili-
tary life. I was discharged less than 2 
months before reaching the 2-year min-
imum for full GI Bill eligibility, and I 
have had to fight for my disability ben-
efits while having inconsistent employ-
ment.’’ 
So it took nearly 10 years after their 
discharge to be awarded the VA bene-
fits that Landon had earned, and still, 
this fight continues. 
Stories like Landon’s are heart-
breaking. I thank them for having the 
courage to stand up and to speak out 
about this personal experience. 
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell isn’t just about 
a policy on paper. It is about living, 
breathing people, like Landon and 
thousands more who lived with the 
stigma, the trauma, and the adverse ef-
fects. 
I applaud the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs for announcing that it 
will work to correct injustices like 
Landon’s. And I urge my colleagues in 
this Chamber to support these efforts 
and 
others 
that 
will 
provide 
all 
LGBTQ-plus servicemembers and vet-
erans with the full measure of equality, 
of care, and of respect that they have 
earned through their service. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative PAPPAS for shar-
ing the testimony of Landon Marchant. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MOULTON), a Congressman who himself 
is a Marine veteran, to share the story 
of Air Force veteran Hanna Tripp. 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding. 
Hanna Tripp served in the Air Force 
from 2009 to 2013. Hanna is also a Team 
Moulton alum, where she did extraor-
dinary work for veterans in Massachu-
setts’ Sixth District. Today, as a senior 
policy adviser at Minority Veterans of 
America, she continues to advocate for 
veterans everywhere. 
I am grateful to be here on this 
year’s 10th anniversary of the repeal of 
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, and I am hon-
ored to share Hanna’s story with you 
all. 
This is her story, in her words: ‘‘I 
graduated flight school at the top of 
my class; flew 20 combat missions in 
Iraq; and later brought back the re-
mains of our fallen from Afghanistan. 
‘‘Objectively, I was a good airman. 
However, nothing that I did or could do 
would supersede the fact that I was 
trans. In coming out, my service to 
this country would have been made ir-
relevant simply by this one aspect of 
who I was. 
‘‘So, in order to remain, I chose to bi-
furcate myself; to project a facade of 
the person the military expected me to 
be. The catch-22 was that while I heard 
members of my squadron talk about 
how ‘the gays’ would destroy our com-
bat effectiveness, I was unable to dem-
onstrate that it didn’t. This is the most 
enduring aspect of Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell for me. It was not that people like 
me were banned. It is that we were de-
nied the opportunity to show our 
worth. 
‘‘Being trans in the Air Force was to 
live two versions of a lie: the lie you 
showed to the world in denying this 
fundamental truth and the lie that you 
told to yourself in doing so. 
‘‘There was also a feeling of betray-
ing the community. How can I expect 
change if I don’t have the courage to be 
the change I want to see? Why would 
those who had negative perceptions of 
‘the gays’ think any differently if I was 
too cowardly to show them? 
‘‘With absolutely no hubris, I can say 
that my service to this country was 
both valuable and needed. I enlisted in 
the middle of a war to serve in a career 
field that guaranteed I would be sent to 
the front lines. I recognize the con-
tributions I made, but I can’t say I am 
proud of my service, as I failed to stand 
up for the very values that I was fight-
ing for. 
‘‘What is strange to me is that being 
trans is such a small part of who I am, 
but because of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, it 
has become a large part of how my 
service is perceived. 
‘‘I still feel the legacy of Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell even to this day. At the VA, 
I was denied emergency care for no 
other reason than I was trans. Even 
now, I remain cut off from most of the 
people I served with. 
‘‘When squadmates died from suicide, 
when Iraq fell to ISIS, and while I bat-
tled my own experiences from the war, 
I did so alone. To this day, people with 
no service in the military still freely 
challenge the veracity of trans service. 
‘‘For people such as myself, Don’t 
Ask, Don’t Tell meant that our accom-
plishments, our stories, and our service 
was hidden because we were forced to 
remain hidden.’’ 
That is powerful testimony from 
Hanna Tripp, an American hero. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I ex-
press my gratitude to the gentleman 
from Massachusetts for sharing Hanna 
Tripp’s story. She truly is and was a 
courageous member of our Armed 
Forces, and it was very moving testi-
mony. I read it in advance and nearly 
teared up. 
I thank the Member for being here 
today to share with the rest of the 
country who Hanna is. I thank all the 
Members for sharing the stories of our 
LGBTQ members. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER), my colleague, to share 
the story of Army veteran Stephanie 
Merlo. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to re-
member and celebrate the 10-year anni-
versary of the repeal of Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell. 
The repeal of this policy allowed 
thousands of American servicemembers 
to live and serve without fear. Finally, 
brave Americans are able to defend 
their country—our country—without 
worrying about both the stigma and 
the punishment that they could face 
because of whom they loved. 
This decision, the repeal of Don’t 
Ask, Don’t Tell, impacted many of my 
constituents in Virginia’s Seventh Dis-
trict, including Stephanie Merlo, an 
Army veteran. With her permission, I 
am honored to share her story tonight 
on the floor of the House of Represent-
atives. 
Stephanie begins by explaining that: 
‘‘A year after 9/11 happened, I enlisted 
as an Active Duty servicemember in 
the Army. My mom cried; my brother 
was proud; and I was honestly excited 
and scared both at the same time. 
‘‘Was I scared of deploying? Sure, a 
little. Was I afraid of failing? Of 
course. 
‘‘But my overall fear, that which 
consumed me beyond the point of de-
pression, was the fear of being ‘ousted’ 
and discharged for being a lesbian. In 
February of 2004, that fear showed its

face, and I was backed into a corner 
with deciding how I wanted to proceed 
with my military career.’’ 
How many servicemembers had this 
fear? How many brave soldiers served 
honorably but with a secret, a secret 
that they knew could end their career 
in the military, their career of service 
to our Nation? 
And Stephanie had two secrets: her 
sexuality, a secret she kept to protect 
her military career, and a secret re-
garding the sexual assault she suffered 
while in the Army. You see, reporting 
it could also mean revealing the secret 
of her sexuality. 
Stephanie couldn’t seek justice as a 
victim because seeking justice would 
mean she could potentially bring an 
end to her career. She could poten-
tially be identified as gay in the mili-
tary. 
Stephanie was faced with this hor-
rible choice, this horrible reality, and 
all the while, her intention had been to 
bravely serve our Nation, as so many 
brave LGBTQ Americans have. 
I am proud to share this story be-
cause Stephanie reflects on the fact 
that had Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell not 
been in place, perhaps a bit of her story 
would have gone differently. She says 
that she never regretted her decision to 
join the Army, but she still lives with 
the regret of not allowing herself to 
live her truth. 
Stephanie’s story is emblematic of 
the struggles, the hardships, and, most 
importantly, the triumphs of so many 
who have served in our Air Force be-
fore the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell. 
During that time, members of our 
military showed tremendous courage, 
selflessness. They served our country 
with the utmost honor and valor, and 
they put their service to country above 
even living their own truth. But our 
military is stronger because of the re-
peal. 
Our military has always been strong 
because 
of 
brave 
servicemembers, 
brave soldiers like Stephanie, and our 
Nation is better because it has been 
protected by people like Stephanie and 
so many of the stories we have heard 
today. Our Nation is better protected 
because of the protections afforded to 
those who put on the uniform. 
Tonight, we have the opportunity to 
reflect on the importance of this deci-
sion on the 10th anniversary of the re-
peal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. For 
thousands of servicemembers and vet-
erans like Stephanie, this decision was 
long overdue. 
May we always look to defend and 
support those who are willing to serve 
our country, sacrifice on behalf of our 
fellow Americans, and build a stronger 
Nation. I am grateful to every LGBTQ 
servicemember who has served, past or 
present. I thank them for their sac-
rifice to our country, and I am so 
grateful that as they serve today, they 
can do it celebrating their full selves. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Virginia 
for sharing the very moving story of 
Stephanie Merlo, for expressing her hu-
manity on the floor today. The Rep-
resentative exemplifies, to me, the best 
of my Caucus, the Democratic Caucus, 
and the values we stand up for, which 
is to include more people in ‘‘we the 
people.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this concludes our 
Special Order hour. I thank my col-
leagues for their participation and each 
of the veterans who shared their sto-
ries and, in particular, every veteran 
and servicemember who gave their 
service to our country in the face of 
overwhelming prejudice. 
We recognize today as the 10th anni-
versary of an important first step to-
ward making the Armed Forces more 
inclusive and accepting, a commitment 
that I and all my colleagues here today 
will continue to carry forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to include in the RECORD a statement of a 
constituent of mine, Staff Sergeant Ashley 
Carothers, who is a veteran of the United 
States Air Force. Staff Sergeant Carothers 
served from 2005 to 2013, and thus was sub-
ject to the ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ policy for 
most of her service. I share her story as we 
commemorate 10 years since the repeal of 
‘‘Don’t 
Ask, 
Don’t 
Tell.’’ 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Carothers was honorably discharged in 2013 
and lives in the District of Columbia. 
This is what she has said about her experi-
ence: 
During my Air Force career, I lived a dou-
ble life. I was an actress portraying a 
straight Airman on a stage called life and be-
hind closed doors a very broken human being 
that desperately just wanted to be herself. I 
was a lesbian in hiding. I was the Airman 
that did it all, scored as high as they could 
on tests, worked to know the job better than 
the rest and volunteer for everything that I 
could in hopes that my busy life would never 
uncover the truth. Behind the curtain I 
dated but relationships couldn’t really com-
pletely build because there was always a 
sense of getting caught especially in a mil to 
mil 
relationship. 
Supervisors 
constantly 
questioning you and trying to set you up 
with the new guy in the shop and always pry-
ing into why you constantly denied any male 
advances. The worst part was the feeling of 
always being alone while fending off the 
wolves (male airmen) and dodging sexual 
harassment and assault as a woman just try-
ing to serve her country. I guess it made me 
stronger in a weird messed up way as I was 
able to provide support to others later in my 
career, support I never had. 
While serving in Germany I had the privi-
lege to be one of the chapter leaders for the 
then-underground organization known as 
OutServe. Prior to the repeal of Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell we had a large number of LGBT 
service members all over the European the-
ater that relied on each other for support 
and a sense of community. During this time-
frame, multiple individuals struggled further 
with their military leadership as those op-
posed to the repeal expressed their views ver-
bally, leaving many with anxiety about the 
future. There were many late-night phone 
calls trying to be the voice of reason in mo-
ments of doubt and desperation when options 
to turn to mental health professionals were 
nonexistent for fear of discharge. Not being 
able to fight for them and speak freely and 
openly to commands for support damaged in-
dividuals beyond repair. If anyone went to 
speak to a mental health professional and 
disclosed the fact that they identified as gay, 
lesbian or bisexual, they would be on the 
chopping block as they were serving under 
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. On top of that, many 
served in career fields that they had to re-
port any visit to a mental health profes-
sional, further limiting these individuals 
who desperately needed assistance. These in-
dividuals had no one to turn to and suffered 
in silence. Most even after the repeal 
couldn’t come out as lesbian, gay or bisexual 
for fear of mistreatment from their superi-
ors. Some suffered greatly by coming out to 
their commands, as they had to work twice 
as hard to prove themselves and were often 
overlooked for promotion and awards. 
Balancing my own life struggles and the 
struggles of those that looked to me for sup-
port was a pretty demanding time in my ca-
reer. My career and health did suffer, but I 
often think about what life would have been 
like if I hadn’t been able to give so much or 
if the military would have just let humans 
be humans by being their true authentic 
selves in the first place. The constant jokes, 
ridicule and mistreatment from superiors 
hasn’t gone away. On this anniversary, I 
hope that those in charge will finally take 
the right steps and change the culture. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the oppor-
tunity to share Staff Sergeant Carothers’ story 
and to remember the thousands like her who 
were harmed by Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.

BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF PAYGO 
LEGISLATION 
Purusant to the Statutory Pay-As- 
You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO), Mr. YAR-
MUTH hereby submits, prior to the vote 
on passage, for printing in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD, that H.R. 5293, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs Expir-
ing Authorities Act of 2021, as amend-
ed, would have no significant effect on 
the deficit, and therefore, the budg-
etary effects of such bill are estimated 
as zero.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2021 
No. 162 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who comes to us with 
light and life, turn the illumination of 
Your love upon our lawmakers, pro-
viding them with strength for today 
and bright hopes for tomorrow. May 
they feel Your presence moment by 
moment and comprehend that You can 
still make the crooked places straight. 
Lord, remind them that they are 
stewards of Your blessings and ac-
countable to You for their actions. 
Help them also to remember that You 
require faithfulness from all who serve 
Your Kingdom. 
We pray in Your wonderful Name. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate begins this week with a lot 
to accomplish in very little time. This 
week, and in weeks to come, Senate 
Democrats will continue our work to 
pass historic legislation to strengthen 
our economy and renew America’s mid-
dle class for the 21st century. 
Very soon, we will also take up a 
continuing resolution to avoid a need-
less government shutdown and provide 
emergency funding necessary to settle 
Afghan refugees and those devastated 
by this summer’s natural disasters. 
We must also work on a bipartisan 
basis to extend the debt ceiling to pre-
serve the very important and cherished 
full faith and credit of the United 
States. 
The Senate will also consider re-
cently introduced voting rights legisla-
tion and advancing President Biden’s 
nominees to the judiciary and to his 
administration. 
So the next few weeks will be critical 
weeks for the Senate. Members should 
be prepared for the possibility of work-
ing late nights and into the weekend. 
On the nominations front, we will 
begin the week by confirming Ms. 
Veronica Rossman of Colorado to serve 
on the Tenth Circuit. Ms. Rossman has 
spent the majority of her career in pub-
lic service, representing criminal de-
fendants who cannot afford counsel of-
tentimes. She would be one of very few 
Federal public defenders on the entire 
Federal bench, bringing both personal 
and professional diversity to our courts 
at a time when we need to strengthen 
the public’s trust in the Federal judici-
ary. 
In addition to Ms. Rossman’s con-
firmation, Senate Democrats are work-
ing to confirm many other nominees 
for a critical number of Agencies, in-
cluding the Departments of Defense, 
State, and Treasury. 
Now, unfortunately, some of our Re-
publican colleagues have chosen to 
play cheap political games and stone-
wall 
the 
confirmation 
of 
these 
uncontroversial but essential nomi-
nees. 
Let’s be clear. By blocking these per-
fectly qualified public servants, my Re-
publican colleagues are deliberately 
hindering our government’s ability to 
protect our country and to work with 
our allies abroad. 
These nominees should be the work 
of a few hours at most. Many of them 
have been reported out of committee 
with bipartisan support and, under nor-
mal circumstances, would be confirmed 
without any trouble. 
And so while my Republican col-
leagues won’t be able to stop these 
nominees from reaching final con-
firmation, their stonewalling will drag 
out what would normally be a routine 
and easy process. The few obstruction-
ists on the Republican side who are 
leading this charge are deliberately de-
railing the confirmation of these im-
portant nominees in an all-out effort to 
gain the support of hard-right elements 
of their party, and in the process—the 
nasty political process they are en-
gaged in—they are making Americans 
less safe at home and abroad. They 
should stop immediately, and the Re-
publican leader should admonish them. 
Now, on the legislative front, Demo-
crats continue to make good progress 
toward enacting our Build Back Better 
agenda into law. Last week, the House 
completed their markups—the House 
committees completed their markups 
on the legislative text that underpins 
Democrats’ reconciliation bill. 
Here in the Senate, our caucus held a 
long and productive discussion last 
week about the substance of our bill. 
We will continue these discussions as 
the week progresses. 
Now, no one expected that it would 
be easy to pass legislation to transform 
the American economy and provide the 
biggest tax cut for the middle class in 
a generation. But no one in this body 
was elected to do only the easy stuff. 
We have a lot of hard work to do, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6536 
September 20, 2021 
we are going to keep at it until we get 
the job done. 
Now, I just want to say something 
about the news we received last night 
about the Senate Parliamentarian. 
Last night’s ruling was extremely 
disappointing. It saddened me. It frus-
trated me. It angered me. But make no 
mistake. The fight continues. 
Senate Democrats have prepared al-
ternative proposals and will be holding 
additional meetings with the Senate 
Parliamentarian in the coming days. 
I have been working closely with my 
colleagues in the Senate, including Ju-
diciary Chairman DURBIN, Senators 
PADILLA, MENENDEZ, LUJA´ N, and COR-
TEZ MASTO, and we will continue our 
fight to find the best option available 
to provide immigrants with the chance 
at one day obtaining lawful residence 
here in America. 
The last year and a half have shown 
how vital our immigrants have been to 
keeping our economy going during a 
time of crisis. So many risked their 
lives on the frontline of this pandemic 
but remain excluded from the very 
same benefits that have kept millions 
of others secure during these hard 
times. 
We are short of workers from one end 
of America to the other. One of the rea-
sons, the Trump administration dra-
matically cut back on immigrants in 
this country. We need them. We need 
them in our labor force. We need them 
to continue American vitality. We need 
them because they are part of the 
American Dream. 
It is estimated in my city by some 
that one-third of the healthcare work-
ers at the height of COVID who risked 
their lives for us were immigrants. 
Having a strong law that helps our 
immigrants is vital. The American peo-
ple understand that fixing our broken 
immigration system is a moral impera-
tive and an economic imperative. Im-
migration reform has been one of the 
most important causes of my time in 
the Senate, and I will not stop fighting 
to achieve it. 
Finally, on addressing the debt limit, 
on debt limit the Republicans are doing 
a dine-and-dash of historic proportions 
that hurts the American people and 
hurts our country. That hurts the 
American people and hurts our coun-
try. 
In the immediate future, both parties 
will have to come together to allow the 
Federal Government to continue its 
most important responsibility: paying 
the bills and making good on our out-
standing obligations. 
A few minutes ago, I joined with 
Speaker PELOSI in announcing that the 
continuing resolution that we will take 
up to avoid a government shutdown 
will also include a suspension of the 
debt limit through December 2022, al-
lowing us to meet our obligations and 
preserve the full faith and credit of 
these United States of America. Sus-
pending the debt limit through Decem-
ber of 2022 provides an amount of time 
commensurate with the debt that was 
incurred as a result of the $908 billion 
COVID emergency relief bill last year. 
That was a bill that was passed when 
Donald Trump was President and Sen-
ator MCCONNELL was the majority lead-
er of the Senate. It was passed under 
Republican leadership. That is the debt 
we are paying in this bill. The legisla-
tion that funded this $908 billion in 
COVID relief was supported by more 
than 40 Republicans and signed into 
law by President Trump. So anyone 
who says this is Democratic debt is not 
talking fact; they are talking fiction. 
Both sides—both sides—have a re-
sponsibility to pay for the debt that we 
have already incurred. It has always 
been done in a bipartisan way. Unfortu-
nately, last week, Leader MCCONNELL 
announced that the Senate Repub-
licans are inclined to deliberately turn 
their backs on their obligations. 
When asked if Republicans would 
block an extension of the debt limit, 
Leader MCCONNELL, amazingly and cra-
venly, 
said 
that 
‘‘Republicans 
are 
united in opposition to raising the debt 
ceiling.’’ Shame. This is the same 
Leader MCCONNELL who urged Demo-
crats and Republicans to support rais-
ing the debt ceiling when Donald 
Trump was President and he was ma-
jority leader. He always comes up with 
some sophistry as to why it is dif-
ferent, but everyone knows it is not 
different. In fact, Democrats supported 
three times raising the debt ceiling 
when Trump was President, and if my 
recollection is right, at least one of 
those times was when the House, the 
Senate, and the Presidency were con-
trolled by Republicans. 
Should Republicans careen our coun-
try toward a default, our country could 
actually be plunged into recession— 
laying off millions, making it harder 
for people to pay for the food on the 
table and their mortgages and their 
rent. Shame, shame on the Republican 
leader. 
As Secretary Yellen put it just days 
ago, failure to raise the debt limit 
would have ‘‘absolutely catastrophic 
economic 
consequences 
. . . 
[and] 
would precipitate a financial crisis.’’ A 
default would risk sending interest 
rates sky high across the board, hurt-
ing consumers, small businesses, and 
our country’s ability to borrow in the 
future. Our economy, still fresh off the 
trauma of the COVID crisis, could slip 
back into recession and undo every-
thing we have done to help struggling 
Americans pick themselves back up. 
Now, many on the other side, includ-
ing the Republican leader himself, are 
trying to justify their reckless position 
with deeply misleading talking points. 
They have argued over and over again 
that they refuse to work with Demo-
crats because they oppose our forth-
coming legislative agenda. Of course, 
what they don’t say is that these two 
issues have nothing to do with each 
other. 
The 
forthcoming 
legislative 
agenda has not incurred any debt—a 
nickel of debt—in the United States. It 
was the previous agenda of President 
Trump and the Republican Senate and 
Republicans in the House that created 
this debt. 
Republicans ignore the analysis like 
the one done by the Washington Post, 
which observed that ‘‘roughly 97 per-
cent of the current U.S. cumulative 
debt was accrued before Biden took of-
fice.’’ Indeed, none other than the Wall 
Street Journal made this even clearer. 
‘‘Raising the debt limit wouldn’t facili-
tate future spending,’’ it said, ‘‘and 
Congress would still need to raise the 
debt limit this fall even if no new 
major spending programs are enacted.’’ 
I want to repeat that not just for 
Leader MCCONNELL but for my Repub-
lican colleagues. Hopefully there are 
some who will rise to their responsi-
bility and abandon this crass, craven, 
political move, which would do such 
harm to the United States, that the 
Republican leader has proffered. So I 
will read it again. The Wall Street 
Journal said, ‘‘Raising the debt limit 
wouldn’t facilitate future spending’’ 
and went on to say that ‘‘Congress 
would still need to raise the debt limit 
this fall even if no new major spending 
programs are enacted.’’ 
So the bottom line is simple. Let me 
repeat. What Republicans are doing is 
nothing short of a dine-and-dash of his-
toric proportions. They want working- 
class American families to foot the bill 
for their irresponsibility, and as a con-
sequence of their callous political 
games, it will be veterans and Social 
Security payment recipients who suffer 
most. 
This isn’t just another partisan fight. 
This isn’t who can be more macho. 
This is about the country. All too 
often, the press—they make it into 
macho, macho. That is wrong. What 
one party is doing here, everyone 
knows, is deliberately wrong—at least 
the Republican leader and all those 
who choose to follow him—with serious 
consequences for the people. It is not 
just another partisan fight; it is about 
avoiding a crisis that would undo all 
the progress our country has made to 
heal itself of the COVID crisis. 
Democrats are going to do the re-
sponsible thing and vote to extend the 
debt limit when the time comes. We 
will see which of our Republican col-
leagues on the other side will have the 
strength and the courage to follow 
suit. 
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Margaret Irene Strickland, of 
New Mexico, to be United States Dis-
trict Judge for the District of New 
Mexico. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
over the past year and a half, senior 
Democratic leaders decided the up-
heaval and hardship of a once-in-a-cen-
tury pandemic was actually a chance 
to justify radical leftwing change. 
This isn’t just me conjecturing; it is 
what they keep saying. Right at the 
start of the crisis, March 2020, the 
House Democratic Whip said the pan-
demic offered ‘‘a tremendous oppor-
tunity to restructure things to fit our 
vision.’’ 
Just last week, President Biden said: 
‘‘This pandemic has been God-awful for 
so many reasons. . . . But’’—‘‘but,’’ he 
said—‘‘it does present us with an op-
portunity.’’ So they get points for hon-
esty, at least. The reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree the Democrats are writ-
ing behind closed doors is designed to 
leave Americans with a socialist coun-
try they never voted for and a country 
that working families, in many ways, 
would barely recognize. 
Last night, one of those many efforts 
hit a stumbling block. Senate Demo-
crats were reminded the rules of this 
institution will not permit them to 
shove a massive amnesty for illegal im-
migrants into a reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree they want to ram 
through on a party-line basis. 
Our Democratic colleagues cannot 
pretend that massive transformational 
policy changes are mere budgetary 
tweaks. As no less an authority than 
our colleague now-Chairman BERNIE 
SANDERS said just a few years ago, ‘‘the 
function of reconciliation is to adjust 
federal spending and revenue, not’’— 
not—‘‘to enact major changes in social 
policy.’’ That is Chairman SANDERS a 
few years ago. That is a lesson he and 
his caucus need to relearn. 
Even with the border as insecure as 
it has ever been, the far left wanted 
sweeping amnesty, and Democratic 
leaders dutifully tried their very best. 
It just goes to show you how radical 
this legislation is going to be. 
Democrats want to tamper with 
Americans’ Medicare and stretch the 
program even thinner, while it already 
faces fiscal challenges. They want to 
interfere massively with the States 
that choose not to bow to Obamacare 
mandates on Medicaid; they want to 
use healthcare dollars to line the pock-
ets of special interests with big union 
giveaways; and they want to impose so-
cialist price controls on Americans’ 
medicines that would leave us with 
fewer new treatments and new cures in 
the future. 
It adds up to a massive leap toward 
socialized medicine. But somehow this 
still only scratches the surface. 
Democrats are also trying to force 
through 
an 
unprecedented 
Federal 
takeover 
of 
American 
families’ 
childcare options that may leave faith- 
based childcare providers high and dry. 
They want an all-out assault on afford-
able, reliable, homegrown American 
energy so the entire country could be 
marched 
toward 
California 
utility 
prices, California gas prices, and Cali-
fornia electricity blackouts—just what 
families want. 
Look, I could go on all day. The reck-
less taxing-and-spending spree that 
Democrats are writing behind closed 
doors is shaping up to be exactly what 
they promised: an effort to exploit this 
terrible but temporary pandemic as a 
Trojan horse for permanent socialism. 
Now, on a related matter, Democrats 
have united, unified control of the Sen-
ate, the House, and the White House. 
Their strategy for all this trans-
formational borrowing, spending, and 
tax hikes was deliberately designed to 
include no Republican input and to re-
ceive no Republican votes. 
Since Democrats decided to go it 
alone, they will not get Senate Repub-
licans’ help with raising the debt limit. 
I have explained this clearly and con-
sistently for over 2 months. We do not 
have divided government. Democrats 
do not need our help. They have every 
tool to address the debt limit on their 
own—the same party-line process they 
used 
to 
ram 
through 
inflationary 
spending in March and already plan to 
use once again this fall. 
Now, look, this might inconvenience 
Democrats. It might delay their next 
reckless taxing-and-spending spree, but 
Democrats cannot risk the full faith 
and credit of our Nation to serve their 
own partisan timelines. Democrats de-
cided to govern alone. Their unified 
Democratic government must put basic 
governing duties ahead of partisan 
wish lists. If they don’t, the con-
sequences for our country would be 
catastrophic. 
Senate Republicans would support a 
clean continuing resolution that in-
cludes appropriate disaster relief and 
targeted Afghan assistance. We will 
not support legislation that raises the 
debt limit. 
Remember, when the debt suspension 
lapsed in August, the debt limit was 
automatically ratcheted up to account 
for all of the borrowing that had oc-
curred up to that date. This isn’t about 
the past. It is about the future. And 
Democrats want to build a partisan fu-
ture without our input. So Democrats 
will not get bipartisan facilitators for 
their purely partisan spending binge. 
Democrats are fully capable of own-
ing this step themselves. The Demo-
cratic chairman of the House Budget 
Committee admitted just yesterday: 
‘‘We can do it through reconciliation. 
[But] [l]eadership has said they don’t 
want to do that.’’ 
One party controls the entire govern-
ment. They have the power to address 
this alone. And as I have warned since 
July, that is what they will need to do. 
TRIBUTE TO HAL ROGERS 
Madam President, now, on one final 
matter, Representative HAL
ROGERS 
once described Southeastern Kentuck-
ians by saying: ‘‘They’re honest, forth-
right. . . . they can see through a 
phony in a minute flat.’’ So it is fitting 
his constituents just reelected him by 
70 points. He is certainly honest, forth-
right, and no phony. 
For over 40 years, HAL has fought for 
his home region and delivered unparal-
leled support for its development and 
its growth. In honor of HAL becoming 
the longest serving Representative in 
the history of the Commonwealth ear-
lier this September, I would like to pay 
tribute 
to 
this 
one-of-a-kind 
Ken-
tuckian. 
I first met HAL during the 1971 Ken-
tucky gubernatorial election. He was 
already a rising star in the State Re-
publican Party, having just been elect-
ed Commonwealth’s attorney for Pu-
laski and Rockcastle Counties 2 years 
prior. As a fellow attorney and young 
conservative, I looked up to HAL and 
watched his career with considerable 
interest. 
Less than a decade later, HAL was 
elected to the House of Representatives 
in Kentucky’s Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict the same year Ronald Reagan was 
elected President. Since then, he has 
won reelection 19 times, always by a 
wide margin. He loves his corner of the 
State, and as his repeated victories ab-
solutely prove, his constituents love 
him right back. 
Once HAL got to Congress, he quickly 
went to work fighting for the issues his 
constituents cared the most about. His 
hard-won legislative victories earned 
him praise from fellow House Repub-
licans who tapped him to lead the 
House Appropriations Subcommittee 
on Homeland Security in the wake of 
the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 
Eight years later, he became chair-
man of the full House Appropriations 
Committee, expertly cutting spending, 
reducing waste, and directing funds to 
important projects all across the coun-
try. As a former Commonwealth’s at-
torney, HAL used his law enforcement 
credentials to defend Kentucky from a 
wide array of threats. Before the rest 
of America was paying full attention to 
the scourge of substance abuse, HAL 
launched Operation UNITE. 
The anti-narcotics initiative covers 
32 Kentucky counties and has been on 
the frontlines in the fight against the 
opioid epidemic, helping to lock up 
thousands of criminals and remove 
millions of dollars’ worth of illegal 
drugs from the streets. 
HAL is a lead promoter of investment 
in Southeastern Kentucky, which for

too long has suffered economic distress 
and seen indifference from Washington. 
He 
united 
Kentucky’s 
Appalachian 
counties around the Shaping our Appa-
lachian Region, or SOAR, initiative to 
create a concerted effort to attract 
jobs and development to the region. 
He revolutionized Southeastern Ken-
tucky’s water infrastructure, bringing 
new water treatment centers to our 
State and championing flood protec-
tion measures. 
He wrangled Federal funding for the 
Cumberland Gap Tunnel in Bell Coun-
ty, which he described as ‘‘the most 
significant thing that has happened 
there since Daniel Boone began to 
bring settlers through the gap.’’ 
He helped bring the fine arts to 
Southeastern Kentucky through the 
Mountain Arts Center in Prestonsburg. 
Locals are so appreciative of HAL’s 
many projects that they dubbed the 
state-of-the-art Center for Rural Devel-
opment in Somerset, one of his cap-
stone initiatives, as the ‘‘Taj Ma-Hal’’ 
in his honor. 
And that is not the only place in 
HAL’s district that commemorates his 
service. If you visit Southeastern Ken-
tucky, you will drive along the gor-
geous 
Hal 
Rogers 
Parkway, 
study 
groundbreaking technical advances at 
the Hal Rogers Advanced Technology 
Center, and learn important career 
skills as part of the Hal Rogers Schol-
ars Program. 
Whitley County residents were so 
thankful for HAL’s work that they even 
named the home of their new Kentucky 
Splash Water Park, the Hal Rogers 
Family Entertainment Center. 
In Congress, we are just as fond of 
HAL ROGERS as his constituents are 
back at home. I have been proud to 
work alongside this premier legislator 
for nearly four decades. We share the 
same priorities for the people of Ken-
tucky and the same vision for our 
State’s great future. 
HAL would not be the man he is today 
without the love and support of his late 
wife Shirley and their children, An-
thony, Allison, and John. Later in life, 
HAL
met and married Cynthia, a 
Tennesseean who has also come to love 
Kentucky and its people. 
So as HAL breaks the record as the 
longest serving U.S. Representative in 
Kentucky history, let us all give 
thanks to this great public servant and 
the entire Rogers family. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PRECISION AGRICULTURE 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I 
have heard so many inspiring stories 
about how small businesses across the 
country adapted to COVID–19 and re-
fused to give up, even when the odds 
seemed overwhelming. 
Mac’s Creek Winery in Lexington, 
NE, is a great example. Owned by two 
generations of the McFarland family, 
this winery and brewery has been a Ne-
braska favorite since 1999. Like so 
many other small businesses, they 
were forced to shut their tasting 
rooms’ doors when COVID hit. 
But the McFarlands soon pioneered a 
new way to share their work with the 
world. They began hosting virtual 
tastings through Facebook Live, invit-
ing their community to join them from 
home and enjoying these Nebraska- 
made wines. 
Their first event in March of 2020 at-
tracted just a few dozen viewers, but 
their livestreams soon grew to reach 
thousands of people across the country. 
HGTV featured them on their website, 
and they won best virtual event at the 
Nebraska Tourism Industry Awards 
last September. 
When I visited Mac’s Creek earlier 
this year, I had the chance to see first-
hand how they have bounced back from 
the pandemic. Mac’s Creek beat the 
odds, and they even turned last year’s 
hardships to their advantage. But 
years before COVID, they overcame an 
even 
greater 
challenge, 
one 
that 
threatened to destroy their entire busi-
ness. 
In 2013, herbicide drift from neigh-
boring farms wiped out nearly all of 
their 4,000 grapevines. This accident 
cost them well over $1 million in lost 
production and set their growth back 
by at least 5 years. 
They couldn’t just move their vine-
yard somewhere else, so just as they 
did last year, they looked at what they 
needed to do and they turned to inno-
vation to find success. With help from 
a grant from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Mac’s Creek was able to 
buy purpose-built drones to keep an 
eye on their 25 acres from above. These 
drones can help them look for early 
signs of herbicide drift and stop it from 
happening before it even starts. And 
they haven’t suffered another incident 
since. 
This Nebraska business took on a 
risky 
investment 
to 
protect 
their 
crops. Their drones are an example of 
what is known as precision agriculture 
technology, and Nebraska leads the 
United States in its adoption. 
Producers from wineries to cattle 
ranchers can use drones and other 21st- 
century equipment to look after their 
life’s work. For example, if a corn 
farmer wants to use less water, preci-
sion ag technology can help them cal-
culate exactly how much to use. They 
can produce the same amount of corn 
using as much as 35 percent less water. 
If a rancher wants to equip their feed 
bunks with sensors that track feed in-
take, monitor animal health, and even 
measure emissions from their cattle, 
precision ag can help them do that. 
And these technologies don’t just 
measure inputs. Autosteer and map-
ping technologies can also make farms 
more efficient, allowing producers to 
use less fuel to get better results. All of 
these things are potential uses of preci-
sion agriculture technology, and all of 
them help producers become more effi-
cient with their resources. 
This equipment, it has been around 
since the 1990s. But like all tech-
nologies, it is constantly changing. As 
it grows more advanced, the market for 
it expands as well. And we have seen a 
huge rise in demand in recent years. 
Precision agriculture is revolution-
izing the way America’s producers put 
food on our tables, but these tech-
nologies aren’t cheap. Many farmers 
with small- or medium-sized operations 
would love to have these cutting-edge 
technologies, but their cost puts them 
just out of reach. 
The adoption of precision ag equip-
ment has been greatest on large farms, 
where the savings spread across many 
acres can generate enough to make 
this equipment cost effective. This 
equipment has the potential to trans-
form the way producers of all sizes 
manage their farms, but if it only helps 
a small family farmer save maybe $5 an 
acre next season, a $150,000 investment 
starts to look a lot less attractive. 
Madam President, the World Eco-
nomic Forum estimates that if just a 
quarter of the world’s farms adopted 
precision ag practices, farm yields 
globally could increase by 15 percent. 
They have also shown that greenhouse 
gas emissions and water use could de-
crease by at least the same amount. 
Adopting these technologies in Ne-
braska has already helped producers re-
duce soil erosion and carbon output 
while also increasing water quality in 
the area around their operations. And 
according to a recent report about the 
environmental benefits of precision ag, 
even at the current levels, this equip-
ment already saves 30 million pounds 
of herbicide, 100 million gallons of fos-
sil fuels, and 500 million gallons of 
water every single year. And that is 
just in the United States. 
These technologies can help us feed a 
growing population while also caring 
for our environment. We should be en-
couraging more producers to turn to 
precision agriculture, and that is why I 
am joining with the senior Senator 
from Minnesota to introduce a bill to 
create a loan program that would help 
them do just that. 
My bill would establish the Precision 
Agriculture 
Loan 
Program, 
which 
would offer low-cost and low-term 
loans to producers who want to adopt 
precision ag technologies but they may 
be unable to make these investments 
through traditional banks. This would 
be the first Federal loan program dedi-
cated entirely to precision ag, and in-
stead of upward of 5 percent in inter-
est, producers could pay interest rates 
under 2 percent on loans 3 to 12 years 
in length. These loans would cover pre-
cision ag technology that improves ef-
ficiency or it reduces inputs. My bill 
would help the math start to make 
sense for our producers who would like 
to adopt these technologies, but they 
haven’t been able to afford them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6539 
September 20, 2021 
It is rare to find an issue that is so 
clearly a win-win for everyone in-
volved. From the University of Ne-
braska to the Association of Equip-
ment 
Manufacturers, 
the 
Nebraska 
Farm Bureau, and the American Con-
servation Coalition, support is growing 
for making precision agriculture more 
accessible. 
Another bill I introduced with Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR in April, which would 
help farmers connect precision ag tech-
nologies to each other through the 
internet of things, has been met with a 
similar outpouring of support. That is 
because 
precision 
agriculture—those 
technologies—really 
have 
no 
draw-
backs. It is better for ag producers, 
rural communities, consumers, and the 
environment, all at the same time. 
The biggest obstacle is the cost, and 
that burden falls mostly on the smaller 
farms that can’t afford to take the 
risks. Well, my bill will give smaller 
operations the backing that they need 
to manage those risks. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I un-
derstand Senator WHITEHOUSE has re-
served time on the floor, and I will 
yield to him when he does arrive, but I 
would like to say a few words. 
I would like to talk about the state 
of the coronavirus epidemic in our 
country. But before I do I want to re-
spond to the Senate Parliamentarian’s 
ruling last night on immigration re-
form. 
While I am disappointed by this deci-
sion, I am not giving up on this fight. 
There are too many lives at stake. 
Over the past 18 months, thousands of 
DACA recipients and other immigrants 
have saved American lives as doctors, 
intensive care nurses, paramedics, res-
piratory therapists. They have risked 
their own lives for us, for our friends 
and loved ones. The least we can do to 
honor their sacrifice is give them a 
path to legal status in America. 
In the coming days, Senate Demo-
crats will present an alternative pro-
posal to the Senate Parliamentarian. 
But the fact is, we already know how 
essential immigrants are to America 
and our economic future. 
During the pandemic, undocumented 
immigrants have not only been saving 
lives in our Nation’s hospitals. They 
have been toiling in extreme heat on 
farms across the country to secure the 
food that we eat every day in America. 
They have defended our national secu-
rity as members of the military. They 
have been working as home health 
aides, helping care for our parents and 
family members with disabilities. And 
they have been caring for our children 
as teachers and childcare workers. 
They are Americans in every way ex-
cept for their official legal status. It is 
far past time to fix that, and that is ex-
actly what Senate Democrats intend to 
do through budget reconciliation. 
This is an issue which is not new to 
the Senate. It is certainly not new to 
me. It was 20 years ago that I intro-
duced the DREAM Act—20 years. 
Of course, many people have said: 
DURBIN, if you are such a great legis-
lator, what are you waiting for? 
And a lot of these Dreamers and 
DACA-protected people have said the 
same. 
I will tell them that, on at least five 
separate occasions, we have brought 
the DREAM Act to the floor of the 
Senate only to be stopped by the fili-
buster—five times during the course of 
20 years. 
The one time that it was passed dur-
ing comprehensive immigration re-
form, the Republican leadership in the 
House refused to consider the measure, 
and it was left in the current state. 
I recall the previous President, Don-
ald Trump, assuring me that he was 
going to take care of those kids—in his 
own words. Well, he certainly did. He 
tried to abolish DACA and to remove 
the protection which 780,000 of these 
young people have. 
You see, these are young people who 
came to the United States as infants, 
toddlers, and little babies. They were 
brought here by their parents, and they 
grew up in America and did everything 
you were supposed to do—went to 
school, had the odd jobs, worked 
around the house, believed in the fu-
ture of this country. But when they 
showed up in the classrooms every day, 
they lifted their hands and pledged al-
legiance to that flag. They believed it 
was their flag. And it wasn’t until later 
in life that their parents leveled with 
them, told them that wasn’t the case 
at all; they were undocumented—tech-
nically illegal, in the words of some. 
I can’t imagine having that hanging 
over your head, knowing that any day 
there might be a knock on the door, 
that someone in your family might be 
removed, or your whole family de-
ported, for that matter. They lived 
under that shadow their entire lives, 
and they still did remarkable, coura-
geous things. 
I have come to the floor of the Sen-
ate 125 times to tell their stories indi-
vidually with color photographs, to let 
my colleagues know that there are peo-
ple behind these numbers—real people, 
amazing people. And over the years 
that I have told their stories, more and 
more of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle have come up afterward and 
said: What can we do? 
Well, what we can do is we can pass 
legislation to give these young people a 
chance, to give many others a chance 
too. 
These farm workers, for goodness 
sakes—half of the farm workers toiling 
in America today are undocumented. 
We don’t think twice about whether we 
are going to eat the fruit that they 
pick or the vegetables they deliver to 
the market. We take it for granted 
that it will be there. Many of these 
people have spent a lifetime working 
for dirt wages in miserable jobs that 
many Americans wouldn’t consider. 
To give them a chance to become 
legal in America is a reflection on who 
we are. 
I know my critics will say: Aren’t 
you paying any attention to the south-
ern border? 
I am. There is a lot to be done. Right 
now, we are dealing in Del Rio, TX, 
with thousands of Haitians who were 
lured by some of these smugglers and 
others to come to that port in the hope 
of being able to enter the United 
States. That is not happening in most 
cases. Many of them are even being re-
turned to Haiti. 
It doesn’t solve the individual family 
problem but addresses the reality of 
immigration in America today. There 
are certain fundamentals we need in 
any immigration system. We won’t get 
those fundamentals with the current 
laws. 
What are they? Basically, we need 
border security. In an age of terrorism 
and drugs, we need to know who is 
coming into this country and whether 
they are bringing anything with them 
that will hurt anyone. Secondly, we 
should never knowingly allow a dan-
gerous person to come in the United 
States or to stay in an undocumented 
status, period. And number three, 
America cannot absorb, at any given 
time, everyone who wants to come and 
live here. We have to have an orderly 
process, one that reflects our values, 
particularly for those who are seeking 
asylee and refugee status. 
The refugee issue was brought home 
to us a few days ago in Afghanistan, 
where families in that country, who 
had helped American soldiers in every 
way that they could and risked their 
own lives, asked for refuge in the 
United States. The outpouring of sup-
port for those refugees outweighed the 
numbers of critics and cynics, and I am 
glad because I think that reflects who 
we really are. 
In the next few hours and days, we 
will be preparing an alternative ap-
proach to the Parliamentarian in the 
hopes that it can be included in rec-
onciliation and not be stopped again by 
the filibuster, which has held it in the 
past. 
I see my colleague, Senator WHITE-
HOUSE, has arrived. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I return to the Senate floor to 
again discuss the scheme to capture 
our Supreme Court; in this case, it will 
be through the lens of how recent Jus-
tices got on the Court. And I will 
choose Brett Kavanaugh.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6540 
September 20, 2021 
I think we all remember the famous 
list—the Federalist Society list—that 
Donald Trump promised to follow in 
Supreme Court appointments. The first 
interesting 
thing 
about 
Brett 
Kavanaugh is that he was not on the 
list of candidates that Donald Trump 
had offered up—this list that bought 
peace between house of Trump and 
house of Koch. Trump had promised he 
would appoint off that scheme-ap-
proved Federalist Society list. He 
didn’t, and yet no one complained. 
That is a telltale right there. 
There was no complaining because 
Brett Kavanaugh knew this terrain. He 
knew the central operative at the heart 
of this scheme, Leonard Leo. He had 
worked on judicial nominations in the 
Bush White House with Leonard Leo, 
who coordinated big donors’ support 
for judicial nominees. 
I have described before a judge who 
bemoaned to me what he called his col-
leagues 
auditioning—auditioning 
for 
higher office, auditioning for the Su-
preme Court. ‘‘Auditioning’’ was a tell-
tale word that stuck with me. You 
don’t audition without someone to au-
dition to. Well, Kavanaugh knew the 
guy at the center of the scheme, and he 
knew that the donor turnstile to the 
Supreme Court was run out of the Fed-
eralist Society. 
So Kavanaugh not only auditioned 
with Leo; he auditioned at the Fed-
eralist Society. And no one auditioned 
harder than Brett Kavanaugh. As a cir-
cuit judge, he campaigned through 27 
Federalist Society events. I think he 
set the record for auditioning at Fed-
eralist Society events. He knew who, 
and he knew where. And he also knew 
what the big donors wanted. So he 
made sure his circuit-court opinions 
signaled his chops. 
On abortion, Garza v. Hargan, OK to 
force a teenager to wait indefinitely 
for an abortion as the clock ran; check. 
On guns, Heller v. District of Colum-
bia, a dissent in the follow-up case to 
the Supreme Court Heller decision—in 
his case, one even more extreme than 
Scalia; check. 
For polluters, PHH v. CFPB, waving 
the Federalist Society’s unitary execu-
tive banner, even saying that regu-
latory 
agencies 
are 
a 
significant 
threat—I am quoting him here, regu-
latory agencies, the things that protect 
us from pollution and cheaters, are a 
‘‘significant threat to individual lib-
erty,’’ if you are a polluter; check. 
And most important to this dark 
money scheme, EMILY’s List v. FEC, 
where he said the front groups ‘‘are 
constitutionally entitled to raise and 
spend unlimited money in support of 
candidates for elected office’’ because 
it is ‘‘implausible that contributions to 
independent expenditure political com-
mittees are corrupting.’’ Yeah, how 
could that possibly be corrupting? 
Check. 
So this is behavior. In nature, when 
you see behavior, you can draw conclu-
sions. When you see, for instance, a 
vulture wheeling, you can expect some-
thing dead below. It is not always true; 
the vulture may just be wheeling in an 
updraft eddy. But when you get a num-
ber of vultures wheeling, it is pretty 
reliable that there is something dead 
below. And when so many judges start 
auditioning for advancement that their 
behavior acquires a name from other 
judges, you can be pretty sure there is 
an audience for their auditioning. 
And Kavanaugh knew that audience. 
His relationship with Leonard Leo, his 
hustling of Federalist Society events, 
his insider knowledge of the Repub-
lican selection process and the big do-
nors, and his ardent display of his 
wares in all the ways big donors would 
want, was a winning combination. 
So Leonard Leo hand-walked him 
around the Trump Federalist Society 
list and straight to the top of the judi-
cial selection pile, and no one with a 
hand in the Trump-Koch deal that 
spawned the Federalist Society list 
voiced an objection. 
Kavanaugh had auditioned his way 
around the list, and the scheme could 
not have been happier with the out-
come. All of that behavior is telling. 
There is a scheme, and Kavanaugh 
knew how to play it. 
Now that the scheme had its man, 
they would fight for him. They did not 
know how hard the fight would be, 
until Dr. Christine Blasey Ford came 
forward with a tale of youthful sexual 
assault by Kavanaugh and a drunken 
buddy. 
But even before that, there were 
telltales 
of 
the 
pressure 
to 
get 
Kavanaugh onto the Court. Thousands 
of pages of records from his White 
House days were withheld; blank pages 
stamped 
‘‘Constitutional 
Privilege’’ 
were presented to us on the committee. 
They couldn’t even bring themselves to 
call it ‘‘executive privilege,’’ the claim 
was 
so 
far-fetched. 
‘‘Constitutional 
Privilege’’ was an invented phrase, but 
they knew no Republican would object. 
The pressure was on. The play had 
been signaled. The money behind the 
scheme was the money behind the Re-
publican Party, so Democrats could 
complain, but the Republican wall 
would hold. All our objections and re-
quests would be overruled. 
Another example of signaling from 
nature, you can tell a lot about the 
wind by looking at the water, as sailors 
know. You don’t have to feel it; you 
can understand the wind by looking at 
the water. Little wavelets show where 
gusts of wind can be found on a still 
day. The water darkens where there 
are stronger puffs on windy days. As 
the wind grows, the waves grow bigger, 
and then whitecaps form. And as the 
wind strengthens more, wind lines ap-
pear—Langmuir circulation, the sci-
entists call it—aligned with the wind’s 
direction. And in a full gale, spindrift, 
foam from the tops of the waves—spin-
drift blows off the wave tops. 
In the same way that you can tell a 
lot about the pressure of the wind by 
looking at the behavior of the water, 
you can tell a lot about the pressure of 
the scheme by looking at the behavior 
of the Republicans—particularly in the 
gale-force controversy over Dr. Blasey 
Ford’s testimony. By all rights, in any 
normal world, Kavanaugh would have 
been withdrawn. The fact that he 
wasn’t is a telling signal of pressures 
afoot. 
Allegations of sexual violence moti-
vate domestic violence and victims 
groups, groups which Senators do not 
ordinarily choose to cross. 
Is one judge worth that? Why not 
just pick another? 
Yet they went forward—another tell-
ing signal of the pressure. 
Senators usually prize their chance 
to question Supreme Court nominees, 
yet Republicans gave that up to a fe-
male prosecutor sent to disarm Dr. 
Blasey Ford’s testimony—yet another 
signal. 
Of course that didn’t work. The 
witness’s testimony was clear and cred-
ible. The female prosecutor was sent 
packing. Republican Senators were left 
in the touchy position of having to dis-
believe Dr. Blasey Ford without any 
basis for disbelieving her. 
Yet only one Republican Senator 
buckled—another 
signal. 
Senator 
Flake demanded some investigation, 
and here, the gale force pressure 
kicked in. This could not go on. 
Kavanaugh was too great a prize. The 
FBI was pressured to do a fake inves-
tigation. That is a fire alarm of a sig-
nal. 
We saw many signs of things awry. 
For a while, early on, the FBI became 
impervious to information. To put it 
mildly, that is not the FBI’s customary 
disposition. An FBI that suddenly be-
comes impervious to information is 
quite a signal. The FBI was told which 
few witnesses could be interviewed. 
The interviews were cursory and terse. 
Other witnesses who came forward 
were ignored or turned away. Even 
when Dr. Blasey Ford and other wit-
nesses were trolled by the ‘‘flying mon-
keys’’ of the far right so venomously 
that Dr. Blasey Ford had to stop teach-
ing, had to leave her home, had to hide 
herself under the protection of a secu-
rity detail, witnesses still tried to 
come forward. So ultimately, under 
pressure, the FBI announced a tip line 
for witnesses to contact, but the tip 
line was a fake. 
The FBI has procedures for things, 
and it has tip line procedures. The FBI 
did not follow its tip line procedures. It 
appears the FBI did not follow up on 
any of the tips that came in on the 
Kavanaugh tip line. Instead, the FBI 
routed the Kavanaugh-related tips to 
the White House Counsel’s Office for a 
decent burial. 
We on the committee were ulti-
mately allowed, in a classified set-
ting—classified 
setting—2 
hours 
of 
what you could call speed dating with 
documents to look through pile after 
pile of documents—no notes allowed, 
no photos allowed, no copies allowed. 
One of those piles, though, was tip line 
results, so we know that tips came in.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6541 
September 20, 2021 
The FBI admits thousands of tips came 
in. None were followed up. 
FBI statements at the time said they 
were 
following 
standard 
procedure. 
What they meant by that, which they 
later admitted, is that in background 
investigations, they are agents of the 
White House and under White House 
political direction, so their regular 
procedures did not apply. The standard 
procedure they said they were fol-
lowing was the procedure of not fol-
lowing the standard procedures, if you 
can get around that verbal somersault. 
What the FBI did not say is that, 
aside from standard investigative pro-
cedures they did not follow, there are 
also standard FBI procedures for back-
ground investigations. The FBI is a 
procedure-bound institution. We are 
still digging and we are going to keep 
digging, but it looks like they didn’t 
follow those background investigation 
procedures either. 
For apparently the first and only 
time in a background investigation, I 
believe an FBI ‘‘investigation’’ was put 
under the operational control of the 
White House so that the White House 
could craft, with the FBI, the appear-
ance of an FBI investigation without 
any real investigating. The kind of 
pressure it takes to do that is intense. 
That is gale force. That is the spindrift 
flying. It takes a gale of pressure to 
have the FBI violate so many of its 
own procedures, to meekly go along 
with the White House’s abuse of the 
FBI’s longstanding reputation for thor-
oughness and integrity. That is the 
kind of gale-force pressure the scheme 
can mount. The scheme had to have its 
prize. 
Republicans even turned their guns 
on polite, honorable, bipartisan DIANNE 
FEINSTEIN. She was accused of a cor-
rupt plot to sandbag Kavanaugh. Sen-
ator FEINSTEIN is not capable of such a 
thing, and everyone knows it, so this 
attack on her was yet another signal. 
There was a new narrative to impose. 
Kavanaugh becomes the victim, wicked 
Democrats become the wrongdoers, Dr. 
Blasey Ford and her testimony get 
swept aside, and, in a well-whipped 
stampede of partisan tribal anger and 
grievance, Kavanaugh sweeps onto the 
Court. 
Another signal that I am still seeing 
now is the effort of rightwing media to 
cover this all up. After Senator COONS 
and I pressed the FBI on this bogus in-
vestigation, the National Review and 
other rightwing outlets immediately 
published articles to tidy things up. 
Their main source seems to be a former 
Republican 
Judiciary 
staffer 
who 
tweeted and then deleted ‘‘Unfazed and 
determined. We will confirm Judge 
Kavanaugh’’ just a few days after the 
Blasey Ford investigation came to 
light, before this so-called investiga-
tion was concluded. 
The coverup article suggests three 
things: First, hey, we had a chance to 
read all of the over 4,500 tips the FBI 
received; second, there was a 400- or a 
600-—it varies depending on the arti-
cle—page FBI report assessing the tips 
and exonerating Kavanaugh that was 
circulated to all Senators, and all we 
had to do was read it; and third, that 
had there been anything wrongful or 
incriminating or derogatory that was 
found, it could have been referred for 
further investigation. 
Let’s look at those three claims. 
First, this ‘‘open access’’ to those 
documents was the 2-hour window I 
was talking about where we could go in 
and speed-date with raw FBI docu-
ments in piles and interview reports— 
again, no notes, no copies, no pictures; 
just piles of documents in a room we 
had to walk through and clear out of— 
and if we wanted, we could return to 
review the documents when votes on 
cloture and confirmation were ongoing. 
I am not making that up. 
The supposed report, this 400- or 600- 
or whatever page report, is actually a 
28-page document compiled by Repub-
lican 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 
staff, not the FBI, with hundreds of 
pages of attachments to thicken it up. 
Those 28 pages are pure political white-
wash that cast aside the credible 
claims offered to the FBI for further 
investigation but altogether ignored. 
Saying that this Republican committee 
report—so-called—was 
available 
to 
Senate Democrats is like saying we 
should have turned on FOX News for 
the lowdown on these tips—not actu-
ally. 
As to the idea that we could have re-
ferred anything suspicious for further 
examination, I really don’t know what 
these rightwing outlets are talking 
about. If they meant the FBI, that is 
not true. The FBI and the White House 
had agreed that the investigation was 
over as far as they were concerned. If 
they mean the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, that is as laughable as the 28- 
page whitewash. 
One last signal here. The FBI con-
tinues to dodge questions about this in-
vestigation. It was over 2 years ago 
that Senator COONS and I asked simple, 
direct questions about the tip line. 
Only this summer did we receive the 
first smidgeon of a response. The re-
sponse deflected us to an MOU between 
the White House and the FBI, which, 
when we dug around and found it, 
which we had to do ourselves, proved 
not to substantiate what we were being 
told. So we repeated our questions and 
repeated our questions, and last week, 
Director Wray appeared in Senate Ju-
diciary and promised answers in 2 
weeks. We will see. 
As a prosecutor, I know those cases 
where you can’t go forward, for a vic-
tim, with charges. There could be innu-
merable reasons, but sometimes you 
just can’t. In those unfortunate cases, 
it can matter a great deal to the victim 
that she at least got an honest and 
thorough investigation of her claim. 
Dr. Blasey Ford was denied even that. 
The FBI sacrificed her to the gale-force 
political 
pressure 
applied 
by 
the 
scheme to get this well-auditioned 
nominee into place. 
And let’s get real. You don’t apply 
gale-force political pressure for judges 
who are just going to call balls and 
strikes. Four hundred million dollars— 
$400 million—has been spent in dark 
money on this Court-capture scheme. 
For $400 million, you don’t want balls 
and strikes. You want judges who will 
throw the game for you. You want 
what you paid for—a captured Court. 
And if you look at its track record, 
that is this Court. It is the Court that 
dark money built, and it is delivering. 
To be continued. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
REMEMBERING JOHN KENNEDY BAILEY 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of a diligent public servant and proud 
West Virginian who was recently taken 
from us far, far too soon. His name was 
John Kennedy Bailey. Gayle and I ex-
tend our deepest condolences to the 
members of John’s beloved family. 
I have known John since he was a 
child. He grew up in Fairmont, my 
home area, with an absolutely loving 
family. I have been so proud to watch 
him grow into such a hard-working, 
compassionate person who raised his 
own loving family. My heart aches for 
his whole family but especially his wife 
Holly and their children, Jack, Brooks, 
and Lisette, whose lives have been 
changed in a tragic instant. 
It is in these sorrowful moments that 
we see how much a person meant to so 
many. Since we lost him, John’s 
friends have stepped forward with sto-
ries of his compassion, his kindness, 
and of his public service. I know that 
all of us who are grieving him find 
comfort that his last measure was giv-
ing himself through organ donation, 
sharing the gift of life for someone who 
needed it most. 
When I think of John, I think of a 
man who all of us aspire to be—a man 
who lives life to his fullest, makes the 
most of every day by giving back to 
those around him. I think of the words 
of Dylan Thomas, a Welsh poet, who 
described such a man as: 
Good men, the last wave by, crying how 
bright 
Their frail deeds might have danced in a 
green bay, 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in 
flight, 
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its 
way, 
Do not go gentle into that good night. 
John lived every day by catching the 
Sun in flight, and that is one of the 
many reasons that so many people 
loved him. It is my hope that his 
friends and family have found peace, 
strength, and support in one another 
and in the support of our entire home 
State as we mourn our shared loss of 
this wonderful, wonderful person. That 
is why it is befitting that his life is for-
ever memorialized in this CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD through this speech on 
the U.S. Senate floor today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6542 
September 20, 2021 
John represented the very best of 
West Virginia from a very young age. 
As a Knight of the Golden Horseshoe in 
eighth grade, president of his senior 
class at Fairmont Senior High School, 
and attendee of the Mountaineer Boys 
State, he excelled throughout his en-
tire scholastic career—so much so that 
after graduating from Yale University, 
he joined Congressman Nick Rahall’s 
staff, helping West Virginians in Wash-
ington, DC. 
But the call of the mountains was 
strong for John, and he returned home 
to attend WVU Law School. While at 
WVU Law, he clerked on Wall Street 
but knew his biggest impact would be 
in his home State, so he found his way 
to Charleston. John was dedicated to 
bettering the Charleston community as 
the owner of his own law firm and 
while serving as city councilman. 
John was dedicated to his commu-
nity, whether through his recent mis-
sion to revive Charleston’s recycling 
program or his brilliant idea to in-
crease the Cardinal Train’s service to 
Charleston that he recently worked on 
with my office. 
John was not only a dedicated public 
servant but a talented attorney and 
successful businessman. He will be re-
membered for his professional abilities, 
as well as his service to his commu-
nity. But most importantly, John will 
be remembered for his commitment to 
his children and family, spending much 
of his time at Jack, Brooks, and 
Lisette’s many activities. He was well- 
known among the staff and parents of 
Capital-Midwestern 
Little 
League, 
Capital High School, Horace Mann 
Middle School, and Mountaineer Mon-
tessori. He would stop by the commu-
nity center often just to see how the 
staff and students were doing. 
John was so very kind and always 
thinking of how he could make his 
community better, no matter how out 
of the box his ideas seemed to be. He 
never met a stranger, and was also 
such a good friend to myself, my 
Charleston staff, and all West Vir-
ginians. 
What is most important is that he 
lived a full life, surrounded by the peo-
ple he loved most. I extend my deepest 
condolences to John’s wife, Holly; and 
their 
children, 
Jack, 
Brooks, 
and 
Lisette; his parents, Joyce and former 
State Treasurer Larrie Bailey; his sib-
lings, Anne and David, and their fami-
lies; and his many friends and extended 
family. We will forever keep John and 
his family in our prayers. 
Godspeed, John. We miss you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the 
crisis along our southern border is bad 
and has been getting worse since Joe 
Biden became President. 
Last month, more than 200,000 mi-
grants crossed our southern border— 
the second month in a row that we 
have seen a number that high. Since 
President Biden raised his right hand 
and took the oath of office on January 
20, Customs and Border Protection has 
stopped more than 1.2 million border 
crossers. That is nearly triple the total 
number it was at this point in the 
Obama administration, and more than 
eight times the number of migrants 
stopped at this point during the Trump 
administration. 
These 
numbers 
have 
real 
con-
sequences. 
Migrants 
are 
exploited, 
abused, raped, and some die on their 
dangerous trips to our border. Once 
they arrive, Border Patrol, local law 
enforcement, and nongovernmental or-
ganizations are expected to do a lion’s 
task with a mouse’s resources, and the 
surge of resources to migrants leaves 
serious security vulnerabilities that 
are exploited by cartels and criminal 
organizations. 
Even before this current crisis with 
Haitians, Border Patrol officials have 
told me, just to deal with unaccom-
panied children and the number of mi-
grants coming to the border, that as 
many as 40 percent of the Border Pa-
trol have had to leave the front lines of 
protecting the border, which means 
that the drug cartels can simply ex-
ploit those gaps in the Border Patrol’s 
security line in order to move illegal 
drugs into the United States that, last 
year alone, took the lives of more than 
90,000 Americans by overdose. 
As though things weren’t challenging 
enough already, the city of Del Rio, 
with a population of 35,000 people, has 
been flooded by a group of nearly 15,000 
migrants. Can you imagine? A city of 
35,000 sees this huge human tsunami of 
15,000 
migrants 
almost 
exclusively 
from Haiti. 
By the way, this ought to dem-
onstrate that this is not just a regional 
phenomenon. I know the Vice Presi-
dent went down to Central America 
and said that she talked to the Presi-
dents of the Central American coun-
tries, of the Triangle countries, and 
said: Please don’t send your people to 
the United States. 
Meanwhile, the green light was on at 
the border as a result of the refusal to 
enforce the basic security laws that 
were put in place by the previous ad-
ministration. In fact, it looks like the 
guiding principle of the Biden adminis-
tration was, whatever the previous ad-
ministration did, we are going to undo 
it. 
They forgot to put an alternative 
plan in place, and so the people keep 
coming—1.2 million migrants, just so 
far, since the Biden administration 
began. Well, migrants have now set up 
a camp under the International Bridge 
in Del Rio, in 100-degree temperatures. 
And they have been so brazen that they 
literally have gone back and forth 
across the river to Mexico to purchase 
supplies—food, 
water, 
or 
whatever. 
They have been able to go back and 
forth virtually at will. 
Border Patrol and State and local of-
ficials have been working around the 
clock to ease the humanitarian crisis 
that President Biden and his policies 
created, and they are being over-
whelmed. 
As I said, Del Rio isn’t a huge city 
with unlimited resources. It is, rough-
ly, 21⁄2 times the size of the migrant 
group, and like other border commu-
nities, the city has experienced a one- 
two punch in the last year and a half 
because of COVID–19. First came the 
pandemic and a full range of new ex-
penses. Then the strain was com-
pounded by the restrictions on so- 
called nonessential cross-border travel, 
which has been in place for a year and 
a half. 
Pre-pandemic folks from Mexico, if 
they had the proper paperwork, would 
travel across the border to shop, to eat, 
and to visit family members, and they 
were huge economic drivers of our bor-
der communities. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas 
estimated that, prior to these restric-
tions, between 40 to 45 percent of all re-
tail activity in Laredo, for example, 
was attributable to Mexican nationals. 
That has dried up completely. 
Leaders in Texas, like the ones I met 
with in Brownsville last week, are 
struggling to understand the contradic-
tion between the Biden administra-
tion’s two different approaches. On the 
one hand, the administration is saying 
it is too dangerous for Mexican nation-
als to visit families in Texas or to shop 
in our stores because of the virus; but 
on the other hand, the administration 
is allowing 1.2 million migrants to 
cross 
our 
borders—untested, 
unvaccinated, most of whom are sim-
ply waved on through into the interior 
of the United States and told to appear 
at a future court hearing, which most 
of them will never show up for. 
We simply don’t know what kind of 
risks these untested, unvaccinated mi-
grants who are being waved into the in-
terior of the United States could pose 
to communities in Texas or across the 
country. 
Just last week, the Department of 
Homeland Security Office of Inspector 
General found that, without stronger 
COVID–19 testing measures in place, 
the Department is putting everyone— 
migrants, Border Patrol agents, Cus-
toms agents, and the local commu-
nities along the border—at greater 
risk. 
Still, the Biden administration has 
refused to take any sort of serious ac-
tion that would stop the flood of hu-
manity coming across our border. Yes, 
they have paid lip service. They have 
said: Don’t come. 
Meanwhile, the migrants are on the 
phone, talking to family in the United 
States, or they are simply watching 
American TV as the flood of humanity 
continues to come across the border 
without there being any real con-
sequences. 
On Friday, the current surge of pri-
marily Haitian migrants became so 
overwhelming that the Biden adminis-
tration closed a legal port of entry in 
Del Rio, as well as interior check-
points.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6543 
September 20, 2021 
For those of our colleagues who have 
actually been to the border, they know 
that Customs and Border Protection 
checks people as they enter the coun-
try at the border, but there are also in-
terior checkpoints because we know 
many people aren’t identified until 
they are found in an 18-wheeler trailer 
or embedded in some sort of hiding 
place or when the drugs that people are 
trying to smuggle into the United 
States are found often at the interior 
checkpoints. 
Because of the flood of humanity 
coming across the border because the 
Border Patrol at Del Rio was so over-
whelmed, 400 Border Patrol agents 
were reassigned from other places, in-
cluding interior checkpoints, to come 
help deal with the masses. That cre-
ated a huge vulnerability for the drug 
smugglers and human smugglers. So- 
called nonessential travel was already 
shut down, but the administration bun-
gled the entire situation so badly that 
they had to shut down essential trade 
and travel as well. 
Last Friday, I spoke with Border Pa-
trol Deputy Chief Manny Padilla— 
somebody I have known for years and 
who used to be the chief of the Rio 
Grande Valley’s sector of the Border 
Patrol. He told me that the main focus 
at the time, of course, was trying to 
deal with the humanitarian crisis of 
getting food, water, and sanitation to 
these individuals. Once the most ur-
gent humanitarian needs are met, the 
processing and potential removal of 
migrants will move more quickly. 
So far, a few thousand migrants have 
been moved to other Border Patrol sec-
tors for processing. Again, because Del 
Rio’s sector was overwhelmed, they 
had to bus them as far away as Arizona 
just to process people through the bor-
der. Some have already been returned 
to Haiti, and in the coming days, we 
can expect more flights to move some 
of the thousands of migrants back 
home. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has claimed that they will use 
title 42, a public health authority, to 
expel the vast majority of migrants. 
But the administration needs to be 
honest with us. 
Will they use this title 42 authority— 
again, to protect the public health—to 
expel migrant families, too, and not 
just single adults? If not, will the De-
partment use the expedited removal 
authority to swiftly remove these mi-
grant families and, in doing so, deter 
others from coming? Or will they es-
sentially 
continue 
to 
wave 
people 
through, encouraging even more mi-
grants to make their way to the bor-
der? And will these migrants that they 
do have remain in custody until a re-
moval decision is rendered? 
We know that catch and release sim-
ply doesn’t work. It can be exploited to 
the point where people know that, if we 
don’t detain them, we will give them 
this 
notice 
to 
appear—sometimes 
called, in Spanish, a permiso—and they 
will be sent into the interior of the 
United States, many of whom are never 
heard from again. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity and the administration need to 
back up their proposed plans of dealing 
with this crisis—and their public state-
ments—with real and immediate con-
sequences to cut off the flow and deter 
future immigration. 
There is a clear and urgent need for 
Congress to take action, and contrary 
to what our Democratic colleagues be-
lieve, blanket amnesty is not the an-
swer. That will serve as an additional 
magnet for illegal immigration. 
Rather than address the crisis at 
hand, our Democratic colleagues have 
spent the bulk of this year figuring out 
how to bend the rules of the Senate to 
grant citizenship to millions of people 
who have entered this country ille-
gally. 
Their plan would have provided legal 
status to people who entered the coun-
try as recently as this year, as long as 
they would have been 18 years or 
younger when they had arrived. It 
would have turned our ag sector on its 
head by legalizing unlawfully present 
farmworkers with absolutely no provi-
sions to ensure that our agriculture 
producers would have access to a stable 
workforce. And it would have legalized 
millions of people with temporary pro-
tected status without even addressing 
the fact that this temporary program 
has been in existence for three decades. 
There is a reason that Senate Demo-
crats tried to pass a partisan bill by 
using the arcane budget procedures in-
stead of the normal legislative process. 
These policies do nothing to alleviate 
the crisis that has existed on the bor-
der since Joe Biden became President. 
They fail to address the underlying 
reason people are unlawfully present 
and living in the shadows in the first 
place, and they literally reward illegal 
immigration. It is unfair to those im-
migrants who follow our laws and wait 
patiently in line. 
Yesterday, the Senate Parliamen-
tarian confirmed what we already sus-
pected, and that is that our Demo-
cratic colleagues will not be able to use 
budget procedures to grant citizenship 
to millions of undocumented immi-
grants in a purely partisan budget rec-
onciliation bill. Our Democratic col-
leagues have said they have a plan B, 
and while I haven’t seen any details 
about what that might entail, I seri-
ously doubt it will succeed. I hope our 
colleagues will respect the decision 
made by the neutral, unbiased guid-
ance of the Parliamentarian and avoid 
nuking the rules of the Senate to 
achieve a partisan political goal. 
In the meantime, there is a clear and 
urgent crisis on our southern border, 
and President Biden has proven that he 
is either unwilling or incapable of ad-
dressing it. 
But Congress also has a duty to take 
action that can only be done in a bipar-
tisan way. It is not too late for our 
friends across the aisle to abandon 
their partisan amnesty plan and work 
with us on this side to address the ac-
tual crisis at hand. 
And I have a suggestion about where 
we can start. Last April, Senator 
SINEMA, the senior Senator from Ari-
zona, and I introduced the Bipartisan 
Border Solutions Act to address this 
unfettered flow of immigration. 
I have been proud to also work—we 
have both been proud to work with two 
friends and colleagues in the House— 
Congressman HENRY CUELLAR, a Demo-
crat, and TONY
GONZALES, a Repub-
lican. So it is literally a bipartisan and 
bicameral piece of legislation. 
Perhaps it is because the four of us 
live in and represent border States, we 
have spent time listening and learning 
from the men and women who safe-
guard our border and those who care 
for migrants and those who live in 
these border communities that are dis-
proportionately impacted. 
There are a lot of people who talk 
about what has happened at the border 
who have never even been there. They 
inaccurately characterize border com-
munities as unsafe and lawless. They 
villainize the Border Patrol and other 
law enforcement agencies for actually 
enforcing the laws that Congress has 
passed. And they propose blanket solu-
tions to the complex challenges that 
exist, which would do far more harm 
than good. 
The fact is, the border is a beautiful, 
safe, and vibrant region. The men and 
women who lead and protect these 
communities are doing everything in 
their power to fairly and humanely re-
spond to the crisis, but they are simply 
being overwhelmed and asked to do 
something that is the Federal Govern-
ment’s responsibility. 
That is why our legislation is impor-
tant. It would streamline the proc-
essing of migrants in regional proc-
essing centers that would provide new 
protections for unaccompanied chil-
dren, one-third of whom have been 
lost—lost—because 
they 
have 
been 
placed with sponsors, and when the 
Federal Government tries to follow up 
and find out how they are doing, a 
third of them never respond, and they 
are lost to the system. 
Our bill would also expedite legal 
proceedings and ensure that we have 
enough immigration judge teams, asy-
lum officers, and staff to do things the 
right way. A number of groups have en-
dorsed the bill, not partisan groups, 
and it constitutes a simple starting 
point that Democrats and Republicans 
should be able to agree on. 
Democrats cannot continue to turn a 
blind eye to the humanitarian crisis on 
our southern border. To borrow a 
phrase from a sign held by one Del Rio 
resident last week: ‘‘No more optics. 
We want action.’’ 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
first, I thank Senator CORNYN for his 
remarks, particularly the points he 
made about the ruling of the Parlia-
mentarian. I come to the floor to ad-
dress the same issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6544 
September 20, 2021 
We received last night guidance from 
the Senate Parliamentarians regarding 
the unprecedented attempt to include 
wide-ranging immigration provisions 
in the upcoming reconciliation bill. 
Now, for the public at large, when 
they hear the word ‘‘reconciliation,’’ it 
is a process by which you don’t have to 
have 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to get 
to finality on a bill. But reconciliation 
is something that has been used only 
twice, I believe, in the last 5 years. So 
it is not something that you just willy- 
nilly go to to get a lot of things done 
that you couldn’t otherwise get done. 
But this looks like what the Democrat 
majority is trying to do in the rec-
onciliation bill with the issue of immi-
gration, and so I am thankful for the 
decision made by the Parliamentarian. 
That guidance by the Parliamen-
tarian indicated that a proposal to le-
galize millions of undocumented immi-
grants is not appropriate for inclusion 
in a budget reconciliation bill. 
As ranking member of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, my office was deep-
ly involved in the bipartisan discus-
sions that took place with the Parlia-
mentarian on this issue. I will say that 
I agree with the Parliamentarian’s 
guidance. I think it reflects an obvious 
truth—changing the law to legalize 
millions of undocumented immigrants 
is a major policy change with signifi-
cant impact that reaches far beyond 
the Federal budget and not appropriate 
for reconciliation. 
More broadly, reform of our immi-
gration laws is an important public 
policy issue. It is a topic that many 
Americans and many Members of Con-
gress on both sides of the aisle care 
deeply about. It is an issue that in-
spires fierce debate, sharp disagree-
ments, and great passion in people on 
both sides of the argument. It does so 
because, at its core, the issue of immi-
gration is about the policies that we 
put in place to give people from all 
around the world one of the most 
meaningful and precious gifts that we 
can give—the right to legally establish 
your life here and, in many cases, pur-
sue American citizenship. And whether 
you pursue citizenship or not, you have 
the right to the American dream. 
And you can see how important that 
coming to the United States is by just 
the hundreds of thousands of people so 
far this year breaking our laws to come 
into this country. It shows you how ex-
ceptional our great America is and the 
economic and the political and the so-
cial system we have that is so endeared 
to people all over the world that they 
want to come here, even breaking our 
laws to get here. 
And, of course, whether it is citizen-
ship or the American dream, that is 
not something that can be boiled down 
to a Congressional Budget Office score. 
It is not something that can be reduced 
to a line item in the Federal budget. I 
think everyone here in Congress and 
Americans around the country already 
knew that. 
That is what made this most recent 
attempt to abuse the reconciliation 
process by the Democratic leadership 
even more obvious. 
As ranking member of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, I look forward to 
continue working with my colleagues 
on measures to secure the border and 
improve our immigration system, but 
those measures need to be pursued in a 
way that complies with the rules of the 
Senate, not the subterfuge of what we 
call reconciliation. 
The recent proposal put forward by 
Democrats in the Senate clearly was 
not, and I hope we can engage in a 
more productive legislative process 
moving forward on the subject of immi-
gration. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, our country is facing several cri-
ses as we speak. We are facing a border 
crisis with recordbreaking numbers of 
illegal immigrants pouring into our 
country daily, weekly, and monthly. 
We are facing a political and humani-
tarian crisis in the aftermath of a cha-
otic withdrawal from Afghanistan re-
sulting from a fatally flawed political 
decision. 
And we are still facing a public 
health crisis with the resurgence of 
COVID 
putting 
a 
strain 
on 
our 
healthcare system and our entire econ-
omy. 
And despite the finger-pointing that 
President Biden has tried to do, we are 
seeing the real impact of his failed 
policies. 
Every one of these crises, from the 
border to Afghanistan, to COVID, re-
quire our attention immediately. But 
you haven’t heard much more than a 
peep from our colleagues on the left. 
Instead, they are focused on jamming 
through a $3.5 trillion spending bill. 
You know, even if you spent $5 million 
per day, every single day of the year, it 
would still take almost 2,000 years to 
spend $3.5 trillion. Think about that. 
Five million a day, 365 days a year, 
would take 2,000 years to spend $3.5 
trillion. 
So they are either completely tone 
deaf on the left or they are playing a 
game of hide the ball in an attempt to 
divert attention from these very real 
problems that are facing our country 
today. 
You might find yourself asking, 
rightfully so: How will this package 
help the crisis our Nation is facing 
now, today? Will it help secure the bor-
der? Will it bring home Americans who 
were abandoned in Afghanistan? Will it 
encourage folks to talk to their doctor 
about getting the vaccine? 
The answer across the board is a defi-
nite no. This reckless tax-and-spending 
spree will not do any of the above 
things. 
What it will do is add to inflation, 
which is already at the highest point 
dating back to at least 2010. 
With recordbreaking inflation and 
American families feeling the squeeze, 
it is long past time for Congress to pass 
some fiscal restraint. American fami-
lies across this country have to. They 
have to have restraint, so why wouldn’t 
we have to have it? 
But the real kicker, as if spending 
$3.5 trillion is not enough, is what they 
want to spend it on. If you think the 
pricetag is shocking, wait until you 
hear what programs are going to be 
funded with your taxpayer dollars. 
Tucked into this legislation is a 
laundry list of progressive initiatives 
to expand Medicare, fund climate pro-
grams, and provide universal preschool 
and free college, all while inflation is 
going sky high. 
With this bill, Democrats are paint-
ing a vision—their vision for what they 
think America should be, not what it 
is, and that is a socialist, welfare state 
with handout programs from cradle to 
grave, with not one work incentive in-
cluded. 
And remember, this bill only needs 50 
votes, and because of that, they are 
trying to tack on everything that they 
know can’t pass at a 60-vote threshold. 
That includes the illegal immigrants, 
which we have talked about. They were 
actually considering this in the middle 
of a border crisis, which is as illogical 
as it is radical. It shows you just how 
radical this thing is—so radical that 
they tried to stick a policy provision 
into a budget bill, which, thank good-
ness, got struck down this weekend. 
The Democrats are also adding in 
parts of this disastrous PRO Act, in-
cluding a provision to overturn 85 
years of precedent enabling lawsuits 
from civil penalties. This would allow 
unions to bleed businesses dry. It 
would cause many companies to close 
up shop and move operations overseas. 
It is truly the kitchen-sink approach 
to try to bypass any Republican weigh- 
in on these important issues on behalf 
of the America that we all represent. 
And if you think these policies are 
bad, the taxes are worse. Democrats 
are looking at a litany of taxes to 
throw at Americans to cover some of 
the costs of the far-left agenda. 
Top on the list is an increase in the 
corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 
26.5 percent. That is higher than com-
munist China’s corporate tax—higher 
than China’s. President Trump’s signa-
ture Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered 
this rate. As a result, we saw a surge of 
corporations returning to American 
shores, and over $1 trillion flowed back 
into the country after lowering this 
rate. A reversal of President Trump’s 
pro-business tax policy will directly hit 
American businesses—the heart of this 
country. That is simply something we 
can’t afford. 
Family farms—they are going to 
come under assault like everybody else 
with the increase of the capital gains 
tax and death tax. To make matters 
worse for farmers, our Democratic col-
leagues want to increase taxes on fam-
ily farms at the time of inheritance by 
doing away with the longstanding step- 
up in basis rule.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6545 
September 20, 2021 
For every family across Alabama, 
this tax bill would mean an average tax 
increase of over $500. More taxes mean 
paychecks don’t go as far. More taxes 
mean small businesses will struggle to 
afford to keep employees on the pay-
roll. And more taxes mean less eco-
nomic freedom. 
Finally, the Democrats want to in-
crease the power of the IRS—we are all 
fired up about that—by requiring fi-
nancial institutions to report any and 
all financial transactions of $600 or 
more made by their customers. Pres-
ently, it is $10,000. They want to drop it 
down to $600. They want the IRS to be 
able to keep tabs on how you are 
spending the money that you earn—not 
somebody else, the money that you 
earn. 
This means that every check you 
write, every bill you pay, every Venmo 
you send, and every stock purchase you 
make over $600 will be reported to the 
IRS. 
Why do they need this information? 
They don’t even effectively use the 
data they collect now. It is going to 
put businesses, banks in a huge bind. 
Turning this information over to the 
IRS will only give the government 
more ability to go after taxpayers 
whose politics they don’t like. 
Remember Lois Lerner—Lois Lerner 
from the Obama administration. The 
IRS has a long history of unequal en-
forcement. Earlier this summer, for ex-
ample, they denied tax-exempt status 
to a Texas charity because, according 
to the IRS, the organization’s commit-
ment to the Christian faith tied it too 
closely to the Republican Party. That 
is disgraceful. 
Requiring financial institutions to 
report this data to the IRS would put a 
huge burden on the community banks 
and credit unions. Some of the smallest 
institutions will be forced to close 
their doors because the cost to comply 
will be too high. We can’t allow that to 
happen. These businesses are the back-
bone of Main Street America and play 
a key role in getting capital into the 
hands of middle-class Americans. 
This policy would also disproportion-
ately hurt minority communities and 
folks living in rural areas, many of 
whom are already distrustful of Big 
Government and would be pushed out 
of the banking system. Democrats say 
they want to help these folks get finan-
cial services, but this policy would do 
exactly the opposite. 
Our colleagues on the left want to 
spend to no end, and the American peo-
ple are sounding the alarm. In a recent 
poll, 80 percent of Americans directly 
point to the economic policies of this 
administration for their financial hard-
ships and the rising prices of everyday 
goods and services. 
When asked about the concerns of 
rising prices at the grocery store as a 
result of this administration’s poor 
economic policies, an administration 
official said: If you take out beef, pork, 
and poultry, the rising prices are nor-
mal. 
Well, proteins like beef and poultry 
make up 63 percent of grocery items 
purchased—63 percent. So when prices 
rise as they are now, it directly im-
pacts American families. There is 
nothing normal about that. It is unac-
ceptable. 
But it is not only the price of gro-
ceries that are rapidly rising. Accord-
ing to the National Retail Federation, 
back-to-school spending is expected to 
increase more than $3 billion from 2020, 
just in 1 year, with the average house-
hold spending upward of $800 on school 
supplies. 
Rapidly rising prices translate to a 
tax on the American consumer. There 
is no other way to put it. Inflation is a 
tax, one that is already weighing heav-
ily on the shoulders of all American 
families. 
Don’t just take my word for how bad 
this bill is. Even some of their own 
party have come out against it, asking 
Congress to take a strategic pause on 
spending billions upon billions of tax-
payer dollars. 
We are not even through the year 
yet, but this out-of-control spending 
will amount to at least $6.5 trillion be-
fore the year is over. You heard me 
right—$6.5 trillion. To put it another 
way, that equates to more than $50,000 
for every household across the country, 
costing more than ObamaCare and 
World War II combined. 
Considering that there is not an ini-
tiative in this bill that would address 
any of the crises facing our Nation 
today, it begs the question: Why are 
the Democrats in such a hurry to spend 
so much? 
You know, the Federal Government 
cannot keep writing blank checks and 
expect future generations to pay the 
bill. It can’t happen. This is real money 
we are talking about. This is not Mo-
nopoly money. The Federal Govern-
ment cannot keep turning a blind eye 
to legitimate crises facing our country 
in order to hastily enact a partisan 
agenda. 
It was then-Vice President Joe Biden 
who said: ‘‘Show me your budget, and 
I’ll tell you what you value.’’ 
I would encourage the President to 
heed his own remarks, because this 
reckless tax-and-spend policy is ex-
actly the opposite of what Americans 
want, need, and value. 
FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT INVESTMENT 
BOARD NOMINEES 
Madam President, on another note, I 
rise to request that the nominations 
submitted by the President on Sep-
tember 13 to be members of the Federal 
Retirement Thrift Investment Board be 
referred to the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs for a hearing. 
This board has the important task of 
administering the Thrift Savings Plan, 
better known as TSP, which is the re-
tirement investment plan utilized by 6 
million members of our Federal work-
force, including our Nation’s Armed 
Forces. The members of this Board 
make decisions impacting the retire-
ment savings of millions of Americans. 
This is a huge responsibility. 
Recognizing that responsibility, the 
Trump administration rightfully put in 
place a ban on TSP investment in Chi-
nese companies, but that ban is no 
longer in force, exposing these Ameri-
cans to significant economic risk and 
undermining U.S. national security in-
terests. 
Because 
Congress 
has 
given 
the 
Board oversight of retirement invest-
ment of millions of Americans and be-
cause the previous China investment 
plan is no longer in place, Congress has 
a duty to thoroughly vet these nomi-
nees. 
Our adversaries are trying to do ev-
erything possible to get a leg up on the 
United States. Because we are the 
greatest country on the face of the 
Earth, investments in companies with 
Chinese Communist Party ties are a di-
rect threat to our national security. 
Such investments funnel capital to 
companies that commonly violate U.S. 
sanction laws and that are actively 
working to facilitate China’s military 
expansion and the persecution of reli-
gious minorities. Chinese companies 
are notorious for their deep ties to the 
Chinese Communist Party and for their 
support of government, surveillance, 
and espionage activities. 
But Chinese companies also have a 
long history of costing investors bil-
lions in losses by manipulating finan-
cial reporting statements and failing to 
comply with basic audit standards in 
an effort to artificially inflate their 
success. The Luckin Coffee incident is 
just one of the first that comes to 
mind. Fraudulent practices like these 
put the retirement savings of Ameri-
cans in jeopardy. 
This is exactly why, earlier this year, 
I introduced legislation to prohibit 
Thrift Savings Plan funds from being 
invested in Chinese companies—to pro-
tect the retirement savings of our Fed-
eral civilian workforce and our Armed 
Forces. 
Protecting these Americans’ invest-
ments and our country’s national secu-
rity is a serious issue requiring serious 
consideration. If confirmed, President 
Biden’s nominees to the Federal Re-
tirement 
Thrift 
Investment 
Board 
would be the gatekeepers, and Congress 
has a responsibility to thoroughly vet 
them. 
I hope that my colleagues on the 
Homeland Security Committee will 
question each nominee on their posi-
tion on TSP investment in China. Our 
Nation’s military and civilian public 
servants have a right to know the 
nominees’ views on this issue since the 
preservation of their retirement sav-
ings hangs in the balance. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO JAKE OKEN-BERG 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to bid farewell 
to an individual who has not only 
served as a longtime staff member but 
a highly respected member of our 
close-knit team, Jake Oken-Berg. Serv-
ing for the last 10 years as my business 
liaison, Jake has been my ambassador 
to Oregon’s business community and 
its leaders. Frankly, when you consider 
some of my positions, Jake has un-
doubtedly developed the diplomatic 
skills necessary to actually be an am-
bassador. 
Jake has always approached his work 
with enthusiasm and a positive atti-
tude, with steadfast determination to 
help me build and maintain critical 
partnerships with the business commu-
nity throughout the State and to pro-
vide their feedback on how we can 
write better legislation. 
His creative pursuit of my partner-
ship with the business community was 
on full display when he organized our 
office’s ‘‘Made in Oregon’’ manufac-
turing tour. That tour comprised many 
trips across the State over several 
years, with business leaders, owners, 
and managers. Some of the most inter-
esting gatherings I have ever been at 
were part of that ‘‘Made in Oregon’’ 
tour. It highlighted the contributions 
that Oregon’s businesses, manufactur-
ers, and workers are making to our 
State and to the country, and it shined 
a light on policies that are needed to 
ensure American companies and Amer-
ican workers stay competitive in the 
21st century. 
Over the past decade, Jake has 
helped develop policies and strategies 
relevant to many sectors of Oregon’s 
growing economy. 
One such strategy has been to make 
Oregon a global leader in mass timber, 
including the production of cross-lami-
nated timber and mass plywood and 
the research on charring and stress 
loads necessary to rewrite building 
codes. 
Another strategy has been to make 
Oregon a national leader in the produc-
tion of hemp for CBD, building on Or-
egon’s legal cannabis industry. 
Yet another strategy has been build-
ing up Oregon’s sustainable energy in-
dustry, accelerating the development 
of wind and solar and wave energy and 
supporting measures to increase the ef-
ficiency of the manufacturing process 
to use less energy. 
It is pretty staggering to think of all 
the balls Jake had to juggle at the 
same time over those 10 years, but he 
did it, and he did it making it look 
easy. 
Our team and our State saw the 
fruits of Jake’s decade of partnership 
pay off over this last year and a half as 
businesses throughout Oregon faced ex-
tremely difficult, dark days amid the 
pandemic and the economic recession. 
As businesses ground to a halt and 
workers quarantined at home, owners 
and managers were grappling with 
issues of how to continue to pay em-
ployees or whether they had to let 
them go, paying rents and leases, pay-
ing subcontractors and suppliers under 
the threat of going out of business. 
So 
many 
owners 
and 
managers 
reached out to my office seeking assist-
ance to access the economic injury dis-
aster loans and the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program to keep their businesses 
and their employees afloat. Jake co-
ordinated our response, communicating 
not only with the business leaders but 
with the local elected officials and the 
leaders of our business chambers. He 
produced 
guidance. 
He 
organized 
roundtables. He led discussions. He 
served as a hotline for every question. 
He helped owners figure out how to ad-
dress unique challenges as they arose. 
When business owners were getting 
turned away from their own banks, for 
instance, Jake took the lead in devel-
oping alternative approaches so they 
could get the help they needed. And 
when specific sectors, like the live en-
tertainment sector, which is such a 
staple of life and culture in our State 
of Oregon, was left out of the list of 
businesses that could receive emer-
gency aid, Jake made it his business to 
get that changed. I can’t even begin to 
guess how many Oregon businesses and 
workers were able to weather those 
dark and difficult days because of 
Jake’s all-out efforts. 
I suspect that if he was here right 
now and we asked him what, after a 
decade of service, his greatest accom-
plishment has been, he would say it 
was simply to help make Oregon a bet-
ter place for businesses and for work-
ers, and then he might pause and, being 
the huge soccer fan that he is, say that 
a high point was when he made a con-
nection so that I could spend a day 
with the owner of our Portland Tim-
bers. 
So, Jake, thank you for giving so 
much to the team and to the people of 
Oregon over these last 10 years. It goes 
without saying that it is going to be a 
monumental undertaking trying to fill 
your shoes, and you are going to be 
missed by every member of our team. 
We wish you the best. We look forward 
to continuing to follow the great 
things that you will do in your next 
chapter for our State and for the coun-
try. We know that in whatever form it 
takes, you will never stop working to 
build a better world. 
Well done, Jake Oken-Berg, and 
thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 535 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, we re-
cently marked the 20th anniversary of 
September 11, a day that forever 
changed our Nation. This direct assault

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6547 
September 20, 2021 
As a combat veteran, as the mother 
of a future soldier, even simply as an 
American, the events in Afghanistan 
have been extremely disheartening to 
watch. I have heard from so many vet-
erans and servicemembers who served 
during this war, many of whom are dis-
traught and disappointed at the hap-
hazard way the war in Afghanistan 
came to a close. I have also heard from 
too many Gold Star families who lost 
so much during this conflict—their 
spouses, their fathers, their mothers, 
brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters. 
Recent events have left them ques-
tioning themselves and whether their 
family member’s sacrifice was worth 
it. 
While we can’t put the genie back in 
the bottle when it comes to what hap-
pened in Afghanistan last month, we 
can properly memorialize the service of 
the brave men and women who fought 
and died to protect and defend the 
United States since the beginning of 
the Global War on Terror. 
I stand before you today to ask that 
the Senate join with me in honoring 
our Global War on Terrorism veterans 
and the sacrifices they made by sup-
porting and passing my bipartisan bill, 
the Global War on Terrorism Memorial 
Location Act. 
In August of 2017, Congress passed 
and President Trump signed into law 
our bill authorizing the creation of a 
memorial 
commemorating 
the 
sac-
rifices of all those wonderful Ameri-
cans who fought in the Global War on 
Terrorism. 
This memorial will be 100 percent pri-
vately funded and will not use a single 
dime of taxpayer money. Most impor-
tantly, it will pay tribute to our fallen 
servicemembers across the country, in-
cluding the 13 who perished in Afghani-
stan on August 26. Among the 13 was 
Iowa 
native, 
Cpl 
Daegan 
William- 
Tyeler Page, who bravely gave the 
greatest sacrifice of all. 
This memorial is going to be built. It 
has already become law. It is ready to 
go. So let’s get it built on the National 
Mall in Washington, DC, where it be-
longs. It is the least we in Congress can 
do for the men and women who have 
given so much. 
We have the opportunity to unite 
around a common cause, while pro-
viding a central location for our many 
veterans and their families affected by 
the Global War on Terror to reunite 
and reflect on their loved ones’ sac-
rifices. 
This isn’t a partisan idea. Earlier 
this month, the six surviving Secre-
taries of Defense, spanning Democratic 
and Republican administrations—Rob-
ert Gates, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, 
Ash Carter, Jim Mattis, and Mark 
Esper—they all wrote an op-ed in the 
Washington Post in support of placing 
the Global War on Terror Memorial on 
our National Mall. 
While nothing will ever restore the 
lives that we have lost, this memorial 
would serve as a tribute to those brave 
men and women and their loved ones 
who have sacrificed in defense of our 
freedom. 
For more than 20 years, I had the 
privilege of serving my State and coun-
try in uniform. As a veteran of the 
Global War on Terror, I know firsthand 
the sacrifices the millions of brave men 
and women of our Armed Forces made 
in this fight against radical extremists. 
Like many others, I have risen my 
right hand and taken that oath volun-
tarily and without reservation. That is 
why the effort to build this memorial 
in its rightful place is a personal one, 
not just to me but to every service-
member, 
veteran, 
surviving 
family 
member, and civilian who has been im-
pacted by this fight. 
This national memorial will provide 
all Americans a permanent place of re-
flection in the heart of our Nation’s 
Capital. It will serve as a permanent 
commitment to the mothers and fa-
thers, husbands and wives, and children 
who lost their whole world that this 
country is forever grateful and in their 
debt. It will serve as a place of healing 
for the thousands of veterans still car-
rying the wounds of war, both seen and 
unseen. 
The National Mall is currently home 
to the memorials honoring World War 
II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam 
war. How could we put the memorial 
for our Nation’s longest war anywhere 
else? 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 535 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration. I 
ask unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MANCHIN. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, 4 years 
ago, I was proud to join Senator ERNST 
in sponsoring legislation to authorize 
construction on the National Global 
War on Terrorism Memorial to com-
memorate and honor the members of 
the Armed Forces’ Global War on Ter-
ror. 
That bill passed the House and Sen-
ate on a voice vote and was signed into 
law August 2017. 
A memorial honoring the men and 
women of the Armed Forces who served 
our Nation in the Global War on Ter-
ror—our country’s longest military 
conflict—is the least that we can do to 
recognize their service and sacrifice 
and especially those who gave their 
lives in the service of our Nation. 
In 2017, I said that it was incredibly 
important to honor these men and 
women, and it remains incredibly im-
portant today. I want the memorial to 
be built as quickly as possible. In fact, 
I think it should be the National Park 
Service’s highest priority for approving 
new memorials, but it should be built 
following the same process that applies 
to all other memorials and commemo-
rative works. 
Since 
2003, 
the 
Commemorative 
Works Act has prohibited new memo-
rials in an area called the Reserve, 
which is essentially the National Mall. 
Since that time, there have been sev-
eral proposals to waive the prohibition 
for new memorials or museums in that 
area on the Mall, including the World 
War I Memorial and the Desert Storm 
and Desert Shield Memorial. 
Ultimately, these were located in 
other high-profile areas in compliance 
with the Commemorative Works Act. 
This legislation would override this 
provision in law to allow the Global 
War on Terrorism Memorial to be sited 
on the Reserve. 
As chairman of the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee, I believe 
this precedent would reopen the fight 
to locate other memorials on the Na-
tional Mall and create more con-
troversy that will ultimately delay the 
construction of this memorial which is 
much needed. 
While I am a strong supporter of the 
Global War on Terrorism Memorial, 
this would be creating an exception to 
the law for one memorial where others 
have been turned away and doing so 
without full committee process. 
Our 
Subcommittee 
on 
National 
Parks, which is chaired by Senator 
KING from Maine, held a hearing on 
Senator ERNST’s bill on June 23. At 
that hearing, the Department of Inte-
rior testified in opposition to S. 535 as 
currently drafted. 
I would respectfully ask my friend 
Senator ERNST to withdraw her unani-
mous consent request to discharge her 
bill from committee and would commit 
to holding a markup of the bill so we 
can consider the options, the impact, 
and a path forward for this most im-
portant memorial. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator withdraw her request? 
Ms. ERNST. Respectfully, I do not. 
Mr. MANCHIN. I respectfully object 
to the Senator’s request but maintain 
my commitment to working with my 
friend from Iowa and the families who, 
rightfully, want to memorialize their 
loved ones to find a path forward for 
this important memorial. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I will 
continue on this path. We, again, 
passed this bill. It was signed into law 
in 2017, creating the foundation to es-
tablish the Global War on Terrorism 
Memorial. So that was the first step in 
a process that has now culminated 
after 4 years of discussion and work. 
And I am very hopeful that the com-
mittee will go through regular process. 
I would encourage the chair to move 
forward on a markup of the bill and a 
vote on the bill. If we can receive that 
markup and vote, then I will stop my

live UCs. But until that point, I think 
it is imperative that we continue push-
ing for that regular order. 
I feel committed, obviously, to those 
whom I have served with, the others 
who have served in the Global War on 
Terror, their families, the affected 
communities, our Gold Star families, 
and others. 
This is our Nation’s longest running 
war. It is a war that has affected more 
than just those servicemembers who 
set foot in the Middle East. My com-
mitment to those families, those com-
munities, and our country is that we 
will continue to proceed to make sure 
that this memorial is placed in promi-
nence on our National Mall. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. In response to my 
friend from Iowa, you have my com-
mitment. We will do this markup and 
get it scheduled as quickly as we pos-
sibly can, and we will work through 
that. We encourage you to be at the 
markup, if you would like, and speak 
on it at that time. We will have the 
park people there and go through this 
in a very diligent way and hopefully 
get a result as soon as possible.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO BILL DUTCHER 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I have 
the honor of recognizing Bill Dutcher, 
general manager of MetraPark, for his 
40 years of service to the Billings com-
munity as he prepares to retire at the 
end of the year. 
Before stepping into the role of gen-
eral manager, Bill served in a variety 
of other roles from part time work at 
the fairgrounds, to maintenance, as 
well as operations management at 
MetraPark. Not only has Bill met 
Presidents and rock stars while on the 
job, but he has also bedded every horse 
stall and washed more than 10,000 arena 
seats. No matter what the job is, Bill 
always brings the same level of enthu-
siasm to the task at hand. 
Though Bill will be missed by more 
than 150 MetraPark employees, he will 
not be a stranger once he retires. There 
are many upcoming events he looks 
forward to attending, which will be 
easily accomplished as the Yellowstone 
County commissioners presented him 
with a lifetime pass to every future 
MetraPark event. Bill has truly cre-
ated a legacy of customer service with-
in this organization that will be re-
membered for decades to come. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Bill for his 40 years of service to the 
people of the Billings community. I 
have no doubt Bill will find new ways 
to bring people joy as he enters into 
this new chapter of life and enjoys time 
with his wife and two children.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO HUNTER JONES 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I have 
the honor of recognizing Hunter Jones 
of Billings for his many years sup-
porting Montana service members de-
ployed overseas. 
Hunter is the grandson of a World 
War I veteran, and the son of a World 
War 
II 
and 
Korean 
War 
veteran. 
Though not a veteran himself, Hunter 
was instilled with a driving passion to 
honor 
military 
servicemembers 
throughout his life. Hunter made his 
way to Billings, MT, as an educator in 
1995 and quickly began a program with 
his students at Will James Middle 
School to recognize and honor Montana 
servicemembers and veterans. 
Following the tragic terrorist at-
tacks that occurred on September 11, 
2001, Hunter saw the need to support 
Montanans deployed overseas in the 
Global War on Terror. He and his stu-
dents began sending care packages and 
letters to the men and women fighting 
to protect our freedoms. For over 19 
years, Hunter has diligently kept this 
up, and now, close to 30 of his former 
students have been inspired to military 
service, including a Navy SEAL and 
members of all military branches, who 
have also received care packages from 
him. Military servicemembers have 
recognized Hunter’s support by sending 
him American flags flown in countries 
where they were deployed, along with 
letters of appreciation. Hunter proudly 
displays them in his classroom. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Hunter for over 20 years of supporting 
Montana military servicemembers and 
for 
teaching 
the 
Treasure 
State’s 
youth to honor those who have fought 
for this great Nation. Hunter’s patriot-
ism and love for the men and women of 
our Armed Forces will live on in the 
generations 
of 
Montanans 
he 
has 
taught at Will James Middle School in 
Billings, MT.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MARIAM C. NOLAND 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor an accomplished and 
highly regarded leader of Michigan’s 
philanthropic community, Mariam C. 
Noland, president of the Community 
Foundation for Southeast Michigan. 
Ms. Noland, a resident of Grosse 
Pointe Farms, MI, has made an im-
measurable impact on southeast Michi-
gan, our State, and the entire country 
during the past 36 years. It is my privi-
lege to recognize her here today and 
celebrate her upcoming retirement. 
Mariam Noland earned her bachelor 
of science from Case Western Reserve 
University in 1969, followed by her mas-
ter of education from Harvard Univer-
sity. During her time at Harvard, Ms. 
Noland worked on a research project 
through the Pittsburgh Foundation, 
another community foundation. This 
was her first experience in the founda-
tion field, a field in which she would 
spend almost her entire distinguished 
career. 
In 1975, Ms. Noland began working as 
an education policy fellow, secretary, 
and treasurer at the Cleveland Founda-
tion. It was there, she states, that she 
truly learned the power of community 
foundations and the power of change. 
Six years later, she became vice presi-
dent of the Saint Paul Foundation of 
Saint Paul, Minnesota. 
In 1984, Joseph L. Hudson, Jr., and 
other civic leaders started the Commu-
nity Foundation for Southeast Michi-
gan with a mission to enhance the 
quality of life for residents of Wayne, 
Oakland, 
Macomb, 
Monroe, 
Washtenaw, St. Clair, and Livingston 
Counties. This group of visionaries 
hired Mariam Noland in 1985 as the 
foundation’s first president, a role in 
which she has remained to this day. 
As a result of Ms. Noland’s steadfast 
leadership and tireless devotion, the 
Community Foundation for Southeast 
Michigan has grown over the last four 
decades into one of the 30 largest com-
munity foundations in the country. 
The organization has awarded more 
than $1.2 billion in grants, benefiting 
countless nonprofits and the individ-
uals and families they serve. This past 
year alone, during the challenging 
COVID–19 pandemic, the Community 
Foundation provided over $101 million 
in grants, its largest annual grant total 
to date. 
Ms. Noland has personally raised 
hundreds of millions of dollars and has 
initiated many new and innovative pro-
grams. Some of the highlights from her 
career include the GreenWays Initia-
tive that has built interconnected 
trails throughout southeast Michigan, 
as well the New Economy Initiative, 
the Nation’s largest multi-foundation 
funded collaborative addressing eco-
nomic development and opportunity. 
Additionally, Ms. Noland was also es-
sential to the creation and develop-
ment of the HOPE Fund, which is one 
of the largest and most effective funds 
in the Nation at a community founda-
tion addressing needs of the LGBTQ+ 
community. 
Ms. Noland, a creative and effective 
problem-solver, is also known for the 
historic role she played during De-
troit’s bankruptcy. She influenced 14 
foundations 
to 
collectively 
donate 
more than $366 million, which, when 
combined with $350 million in State 
funds and $100 million raised by the De-
troit Institute of Arts, provided $816 
million to help protect pensions for 
city workers while at the same time 
safeguarding the cultural pieces of the 
art museum. 
Ms. Noland’s contributions go well 
beyond her impressive work at the 
Community Foundation. She gener-
ously gives her time and expertise as a 
member of the boards of trustees for 
the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy, 
the Downtown Detroit Partnership, 
and the Bipartisan Policy Center in 
Washington, DC. She also previously 
served as vice chair of the Henry Ford 
Health System Board of Directors, as 
well as chair of the Council of Michi-
gan Foundations Board of Trustees. 
Ms. Noland’s incredible work has 
been recognized with numerous pres-
tigious awards and honors. In 2009, she 
received the Eleanor Josaitis Unsung 
Hero Award. That same year, the Com-
munity Foundation established its own 
Mariam C. Noland Award in her honor 
to recognize a local nonprofit leader 
who exemplifies leadership in his or 
her organization and the broader non-
profit community. 
I 
cannot 
understate 
the 
impact 
Mariam C. Noland has had on the peo-
ple of Michigan. She has created influ-
ential philanthropic initiatives, pro-
moted positive changes in our commu-
nities, and enhanced the lives of count-
less Michiganders. She leaves a com-
munity foundation that now holds 
more than $1.1 billion in ‘‘community 
capital’’ that will benefit future south-
east Michigan residents for decades to 
come. Moreover, she has created a 
model for charitable giving and founda-
tion management that is unmatched. 
Though her leadership at the Com-
munity 
Foundation 
for 
Southeast 
Michigan will be sorely missed upon 
her retirement, her legacy will most 
certainly endure.

TRIBUTE TO MITCHELL WALDMAN 
∑ Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, it is my 
honor 
to 
recognize 
Mr. 
Mitchell 
Waldman for his long and exceptional 
record of service on the occasion of his 
retirement at the end of the month. 
Mr. Waldman has served our Nation for

to Senators, Secretaries, CNOs, and 
CEOs.

Whereas the 5-year survival rate for ovar-

cervical cancer, there is no reliable early de-
tection test for ovarian cancer; 
Whereas, in June 2007, the first national 
consensus 
statement 
on 
ovarian 
cancer 
symptoms was developed to provide consist-
ency in describing symptoms to make it 
easier for women to learn and remember 
those symptoms; 
Whereas Black women with ovarian cancer 
are more likely to have late-stage diagnoses, 
receive lower quality clinical services, and 
have lower 5-year survival rates than non- 
Black women; 
Whereas women of color, women with low- 
incomes, and women living in rural areas 
have more barriers to accessing standard 
quality of care and are more likely to re-
ceive care at a facility that has poorer ad-
herence to treatment guidelines issued by 
the National Comprehensive Cancer Net-
work; 
Whereas too many people remain unaware 
that the symptoms of ovarian cancer often 
include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, 
difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, uri-
nary symptoms, and several other vague 
symptoms that are often easily confused 
with other diseases; 
Whereas improved awareness of the symp-
toms of ovarian cancer by the public and 
health care providers can lead to a quicker 
diagnosis and improved outcomes; 
Whereas the lack of an early detection test 
for ovarian cancer, combined with its vague 
symptoms, means that approximately 80 per-
cent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected 
at an advanced stage; 
Whereas issues collecting and reporting 
data related to ovarian cancer risk, treat-
ment, and outcomes are particularly pro-
nounced—especially for underserved commu-
nities and marginalized populations—and 
impede the development of effective policy; 
Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian 
cancer, but approximately 20 percent of 
women who are diagnosed with ovarian can-
cer have a hereditary predisposition to ovar-
ian cancer, which places them at even higher 
risk; 
Whereas scientists and physicians have un-
covered changes in the BRCA genes that 
some women inherit from their parents, 
which may make those women 30 times more 
likely to develop ovarian cancer; 
Whereas the family history of a woman has 
been found to play an important role in ac-
curately assessing a woman’s risk of devel-
oping ovarian cancer, and medical experts 
believe that family history should be taken 
into consideration during the annual well- 
woman visit of any woman; 
Whereas women who know that they are at 
high risk of ovarian cancer may undertake 
prophylactic measures to help reduce the 
risk of developing the disease; 
Whereas guidelines issued by the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network and Society 
of Gynecologic Oncology recommend that all 
individuals diagnosed with ovarian cancer 
receive genetic counseling and genetic test-
ing, regardless of their family history; 
Whereas studies consistently show that 
compliance with those guidelines is alarm-
ingly low, with recently published research 
funded by the National Cancer Institute find-
ing that in 2013 and 2014, only 1⁄3 of ovarian 
cancer survivors have undergone such test-
ing; 
Whereas, according to a 2016 consensus re-
port by the National Academy of Medicine, 
‘‘there remain surprising gaps in the funda-
mental knowledge about and understanding 
of ovarian cancer’’ across all aspects of the 
disease; 
Whereas ongoing investments in research, 
education, and awareness efforts relating to 
ovarian cancer are critical to closing those 
gaps and improving survivorship for women 
with ovarian cancer; 
Whereas, each year during the month of 
September, Ovarian Cancer Research Alli-
ance and its community partners hold a 
number of events to increase public aware-
ness of ovarian cancer and its symptoms; and 
Whereas September 2021 should be des-
ignated as ‘‘National Ovarian Cancer Aware-
ness Month’’ to increase public awareness of 
ovarian cancer: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2021 as ‘‘National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month’’; and 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.

SENATE RESOLUTION 368—DESIG-
NATING 
SEPTEMBER 
25, 
2021, 
THROUGH OCTOBER 3, 2021, AS 
‘‘BLUE STAR WELCOME WEEK’’ 
Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. 
BURR) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 368 
Whereas Blue Star Families seeks to em-
power military families by connecting them 
with their neighbors, both individuals and 
organizations, to create vibrant commu-
nities of mutual support; 
Whereas Blue Star Families annually des-
ignates the week beginning the last Satur-
day in September and concluding 9 days 
thereafter as ‘‘Blue Star Welcome Week’’; 
Whereas, during Blue Star Welcome Week, 
the Senate recognizes the 600,000 active duty 
and transitioning military families who 
move to new communities each year; 
Whereas nearly half of these permanent 
change of station (PCS) moves occur during 
the summer; 
Whereas only 27 percent of military family 
respondents to the 2020 Military Family Life-
style Survey published by Blue Star Fami-
lies reported that they feel a sense of belong-
ing to their local civilian community; and 
Whereas a sense of belonging is essential to 
the well-being and readiness of military fam-
ilies: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 25, 2021, through 
October 3, 2021, as ‘‘Blue Star Welcome 
Week’’; 
(2) expresses gratitude for the sacrifices 
made by service members, transitioning vet-
erans, and their families; 
(3) commits to ensuring that military-con-
nected families feel a strong sense of belong-
ing to their local civilian communities; and

States to welcome military-connected fami-

PORTING THE DESIGNATION OF 
SEPTEMBER

AS 
‘‘NA-
TIONAL 
CONCUSSION 
AWARE-
NESS DAY’’ 
Ms. HASSAN (for herself, Mrs. CAP-
ITO, Mr. CASEY, and Ms. COLLINS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 369 
Whereas mild traumatic brain injury, oth-
erwise known as a ‘‘concussion’’, is an im-
portant health concern for children, teens, 
and adults; 
Whereas, according to information from 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion— 
(1) there are as many as 1,600,000 to 
3,800,000 sports-related concussions annually; 
(2) as many as 5,300,000 individuals live 
with a disability because of a traumatic 
brain injury; 
(3) between 2010 and 2016, an estimated 
2,000,000 children under age 18 visited an 
emergency department because of a trau-
matic brain injury sustained during sports- 
or recreation-related activities; 
(4) an estimated 283,000 children seek care 
in United States emergency departments 
each year for a sports- or recreation-related 
traumatic brain injury, with traumatic brain 
injuries sustained in contact sports account-
ing for approximately 45 percent of these vis-
its; and 
(5) research suggests that many children 
with a traumatic brain injury do not seek 
care in emergency departments or do not 
seek care at all, resulting in a significant un-
derestimate of prevalence; 
Whereas the seriousness of concussions 
should not be minimized in athletics, and re-
turn-to-play and return-to-learn protocols 
can help ensure recovery; 
Whereas concussions can affect physical, 
mental, and social health, and a greater 
awareness and understanding of proper diag-
nosis and management of concussions is crit-
ical to improved outcomes; and 
Whereas the Senate can raise awareness 
about concussions among the medical com-
munity and the public: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of September 
17, 2021, as ‘‘National Concussion Awareness 
Day’’; 
(2) recognizes that mild traumatic brain 
injury (‘‘mTBI’’), otherwise known as a con-
cussion, is an important health concern; 
(3) commends the organizations and indi-
viduals that raise awareness about mild 
traumatic brain injury; 
(4) encourages Federal, State, and local 
policymakers to work together— 
(A) to raise awareness about the effects of 
concussions; and 
(B) to improve the understanding of proper 
diagnosis and management of concussions; 
and 
(5) encourages further research and preven-
tion efforts to ensure that fewer individuals 
experience the most adverse effects of mild 
traumatic brain injury.

HONORING THE VALLEJO YACHT 
CLUB 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Vallejo 
Yacht Club as they celebrate their 121st An-
nual Great Vallejo Race. 
The Vallejo Yacht Club, originally known as 
the Vallejo Yachting and Rowing Club, was 
founded in 1900. Twenty-five years later, The 
Great Vallejo Race originated as a cruise from 
Berkeley to Vallejo followed by another race 
back the following day. This race was orga-
nized by the Pacific Inter-Club Yacht Associa-
tion, an organization created to promote and 
improve communication among yacht clubs, 
encourage boating safety, and sponsor regat-
tas. Though starting from humble beginnings, 
this race is now revered as one of the largest 
inland regattas in the United States, drawing 
an attendance of nearly 200+ boats from 
around the Bay Area. 
Now with the backing of the Yacht Racing 
Association, an organization formed to support 
competitive racing in Northern California and 
the leadership of the Vallejo Yacht Club, this 
two-day race traditionally marks the official 
opening of the San Francisco Bay racing sea-
son. The challenging and scenic course of this 
race draws hundreds of community members 
while showcasing the beauty of the Vallejo 
Waterfront to all participants and attendees. 
Among the Vallejo Yacht Club’s vast con-
tributions to the community is the Learn-to-Sail 
program which is open to both youth and 
adults. This popular program invites all levels 
of expertise to participate in sailing and en-
courages aspiring sailors to engage in mean-
ingful events with the community. Their boat-
ing safety programs along with their local 
memberships seek to build a club that is di-
verse and energetic. The Vallejo Yacht Club is 
both an exceptional example of what it means 
to be a generous and altruistic organization 
and a role model to many aspiring sailors and 
seasoned professionals. 
Madam Speaker, it is no doubt that the 
Vallejo Yacht Club’s achievements and con-
tributions will leave a profound impact on sail-
ors and members for generations to come. It 
is fitting and proper that we honor them here 
today.

HONORING SHERIFF DANIEL J. 
BUENO 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to one of the most influential individuals 
in Jim Wells County, Sheriff Daniel J. Bueno. 
Sheriff Bueno has dedicated his life to pro-
tecting and serving the people of his county, 
and its surrounding areas. His innovation and 
passion for his work will leave a lasting impact 
on his community. 
Sheriff Bueno was born on December 10, 
1955 in Alice, Texas, and graduated from Ben 
Bolt High School in 1974. In his early career, 
he worked as an X-Ray Technician at the 
local Alice Hospital. There, he witnessed the 
tragedies of child abuse, domestic violence, 
and substance abuse. Seeing these issues 
drove the Sheriff to find solutions to this rising 
problem in the community. 
Sheriff Bueno began working for the Alice 
Police Department in 1977 and gradually 
climbed the ranks, becoming the Chief of Po-
lice in 1999. Sheriff Bueno is one of the long-
est serving police chiefs in South Texas. 
Sheriff Bueno is the son of Army Veteran 
Guillermo Bueno and Elva Perez Bueno. Les-
sons in discipline and the importance of fam-
ily, instilled in him as a child, led him to be-
come involved in the Community Action and 
Outreach of South Texas, where he served as 
President and a longstanding board member. 
In this role, the Sheriff prioritized speaking to 
South Texas families about domestic violence 
and child abuse prevention programs. 
The Sheriff was also a part of the Los Ninos 
Program, a group that provides educational 
programs to parents from the City of Alice and 
across the Rio Grande Valley. Sheriff Bueno 
believes the home is the foundation for a 
child’s success. 
The Sheriff’s mother, Elva, also influenced 
his career path. His mother was heavily in-
volved with the education system in South 
Texas. This is where he found his passion for 
the betterment of local education. He served 
as President of the Mexican American School 
Board Association of Texas, and the Ben-Bolt 
Palito Blanco Independent School District 
Board of Trustees. 
In 2017, Sheriff Bueno created the Loose 
Livestock and Theft Prevention Program. 
Farmers and ranchers fill out a questionnaire 
with information pertaining to their land and 
should anything happen, local law enforce-
ment officials can notify the owner and aid in 
helping them resolve the issue. Since its cre-
ation, the program has grown to over 350 par-
ticipants and has helped recover over a million 
dollars in missing property. Sheriffs from all 
over the state have looked to Jim Wells Coun-
ty as a model for implementing similar pro-
grams. Sheriff Bueno and the Loose Livestock 
and Theft Prevention Program have given 
residents in these rural areas peace of mind 
knowing that their law enforcement officials 
have the tools in place to protect them. 
Sheriff Daniel J. Bueno is an inspiration for 
all who know him. He continues to foster jus-
tice, protect the people of Jim Wells County, 
and promote safety for those living in rural 
communities. It is clear that Sheriff Bueno is 
deeply invested in the people of South Texas 
and we cannot thank him enough for his serv-
ice. 
IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE 
MARY ALICE BUCKNER 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to an ex-
traordinary public servant, mentor to many, 
trailblazer, mother, and dear friend of long-
standing, Judge Mary Alice Buckner. Sadly, 
Judge Buckner transitioned on Friday, Sep-
tember 10, 2021. A celebration of her life was 
held at 11:00 a.m., Saturday, September 18, 
2021, at the Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church, 
4400 Old Cusseta Road in Columbus, Geor-
gia. 
Mary Alice Buckner was born in Columbus, 
Georgia on March 3, 1948, as the fifth of nine 
children to the late Reverend Otis Buckner 
and Mrs. Beatrice Rogers Buckner. She was 
educated in the Muscogee County public 
schools, graduating with honors in 1966, from 
George Washington Carver High School. She 
decided early what career she would pursue, 
choosing law because she wanted her voice 
to be heard and to make a difference in soci-
ety. Mary enrolled at Mercer University in 
Macon, Georgia, where she received a Bach-
elor of Science degree in History and Political 
Science in 1970. She was accepted into 
Emory Law School, and after completing her 
first year, transferred to Mercer University, 
where in 1973 she received a Juris Doctorate 
from the Walter F. George School of Law, be-
coming the first African American female to 
graduate from Mercer Law School. 
Mary Buckner accepted Christ at an early 
age becoming a lifelong member of Mount Pil-
grim Baptist Church, serving over the years in 
the Sanctuary Choir, the Pulpit Search Com-
mittee, the Welcome Circle Mission, the Mount 
Pilgrim Legal Counsel Board and President of 
the Matrons 2. In 1975, Mary Buckner joined 
my law firm, Bishop and Hudlin. In 1978, the 
firm changed to Bishop and Buckner, P.C., 
and she became a full partner specializing in 
real estate, probate, bankruptcy, and domestic 
relations. We continued our practice up 
through 1992 when I was elected to Congress 
at which time, she formed her own private 
practice. Madam Speaker, Mary Buckner was 
a pioneer, paving the way for women and mi-
norities. In February of 1984, she became the 
first African American woman appointed Judge 
Pro Tem of the Columbus Recorder’s Court, 
and in 1991, she was appointed by the City 
Council to serve full time, which she did with 
distinction until her retirement in 2019. 
Judge Buckner made significant contribu-
tions to the community through her involve-
ment and volunteer work in organizations such 
as the Columbus Community Center, Past 
President of the Columbus Technical College 
Board, member and Past President of the 
Georgia Legal Services Board, member of the 
A.J. McClung YMCA Board, and a member of

Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. Her concern 
for others, especially children, led her to be-
come a foster parent. Judge Buckner’s bar af-
filiations include memberships in the State Bar 
of Georgia, American Bar Association, Na-
tional Bar Association, Columbus Bar Associa-
tion, and the Georgia Association of Black 
Women Attorneys. 
Among her numerous honors and awards 
are: The Tony Baldwin Trailblazer Award pre-
sented by the Black Law Students Association 
Alumni Council of Mercer University; The Bar-
bara A. Harris Award for Service to the Com-
munity; and the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, 
Inc., Gamma Tau Omega Chapter 2009 Rosa 
Parks Women of Courage Honoree. She al-
ways advised others and especially young 
people that a person can achieve any goal 
with hard work, dedication, and commitment. 
She continued to make strides and create 
paths for diversity in the legal profession and 
wanted her legacy to show that she was fair 
yet compassionate on the bench. She knew 
that she had to follow the law but at the same 
time show empathy and concern for the 
wellbeing of all. 
Judge Buckner accomplished much through-
out her life, but none of this would have been 
possible without her enduring faith in God, the 
love and nurture of her parents, siblings, chil-
dren, Jontell and Jackie, as well as her vast 
extended family, friends, and associates, all of 
whom will miss her deeply. 
On a personal note, I have known Judge 
Buckner as ‘‘Mary B.’’ since 1970, when I met 
her at Emory Law School. She and her family 
have inspired me and countless others. Not 
only was she my law partner, but she was my 
sister and trusted friend. Her friendship and 
support over the years have contributed might-
ily to my professional and political success, 
and I will be forever grateful that she has been 
a part of my life. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives join my wife, 
Vivian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 residents of the Second Congres-
sional District of Georgia in paying tribute to 
the Honorable Mary Alice Buckner for her 
service to humankind and in extending our 
deepest condolences to her family, friends, 
and all those who mourn her loss. Moreover, 
we pray that we will all be consoled and com-
forted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit 
in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

HONORING MRS, SHIRLEY FAYE 
EDWARDS FRENCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy and 
service of a remarkable leader, Mrs. Shirley 
Faye Edwards French. 
Shirley Faye Edwards was born on October 
13, 1955 to the late Harold Edwards and Cora 
Burrell Walker. Born and raised in Marks, Mis-
sissippi, Shirley was a surprising addition to 
the family, coming 11 years after her mother’s 
then youngest child. 
Throughout her educational journey, Shirley 
made lifelong connections. Her third-grade 
teacher, Hattie Causey Purdy, became her 
godmother, and mentored Shirley into adult-
hood. 
In 
1973, 
Shirley 
graduated 
from 
Quitman County High School and matriculated 
to Northwest Mississippi Community College 
(NWCC). From NWCC, Shirley transferred to 
the University of Mississippi where she earned 
her Bachelor of Social Work in 1977. 
On May 21, 1983, Shirley united in Holy 
Matrimony to Willie French, Jr. They are the 
proud parents of one daughter, Whitney Sade’ 
French. 
Valley Queen Missionary Baptist Church 
gave Shirley her spiritual foundation as well as 
a knack for community outreach. At Valley 
Queen, Shirley was active in Sunday School 
as the recording secretary, She served on the 
Board of Christian Education, which not only 
provided guidance and planning around Sun-
day School and Vacation Bible School, but 
also encouraged and awarded academic 
achievements. Shirley has been a lifelong 
member of Valley Queen with the exception of 
three years where she was a member of Col-
lege Hill Missionary Baptist Church in Jack-
son, Mississippi. She currently serves as the 
church’s announcing clerk. 
Shirley has always been known for her out-
going personality and her gift of gab. She will 
talk to anyone about almost anything. This 
would have been a perfect skillset for her 
original dream job, a television broadcast jour-
nalist. However, plans changed and Shirley 
became a social worker. Shirley has used her 
voice to initiate positive changes in the lives of 
her clients and the communities she has 
served over the past 44 years. 
Shirley has a legacy of ‘‘firsts’’ throughout 
her career. Shirley was the first Social Worker/ 
Community 
Engagement 
Coordinator 
for 
Aaron E. Henry Community Health Services 
Center, Inc. She helped plan and implement 
Jackson Police Department’s Domestic Vio-
lence Case Management Program. Shirley 
was the first Director of the Quitman County 
Development Organization daycare center, 
and she was the first Project Director for the 
original Delta Futures Healthy Start Initiative, 
now known as Delta HealthPartners. After 
serving as a ‘‘first’’ in many organizations, 
Shirley spent time in program administration 
during her tenure at Youth Opportunities Un-
limited, Inc. The program she is most known 
for 
during 
her 
time 
at 
Y.O.U. 
was 
M.A.D.A.M.E. Butterfly. While at Y.O.U., Shir-
ley decided to further her education and 
earned her Master of Social Work, which she 
received in 2016. Currently, Shirley serves as 
a Social Work Case Manager for Delta 
HealthPartners Healthy Start Initiative under 
the auspices of Tougaloo College. 
In addition to giving back to the community 
through her church and career, Shirley shares 
her gifts and knowledge with others on a reg-
ular basis. Shirley is well known for serving as 
Mistress of Ceremony (program guide) for 
many church programs and funerals in the 
community. She has worked behind the 
scenes to help plan community programs, 
birthday parties, and retirement celebrations. 
She offers her skills in critiquing to give valu-
able feedback on documents and to help clar-
ify and expand ideas. Her networking is un-
matched and she is never afraid to make con-
nections or requests that will help those 
around her reach their goals. 
Shirley makes sure those around her know 
that she is thinking about them and she cares. 
Shirley will stop her car and speak to those 
whom she once taught in Sunday School, 
former program participants, and former neigh-
bors. She is also one to strike up a conversa-
tion in the grocery store or at the gas station. 
In addition to asking about how the person 
and their family and friends are doing, she will 
often give a history lesson on their family or 
the community. More importantly, Shirley re-
minds people of goals they have shared with 
her, positive attributes she’s noticed about 
them, and offers words of encouragement. 
Much like her mother, she has a phone net-
work of friends and family members she 
checks in with on a regular basis and she is 
very adamant about recognizing and cele-
brating birthdays, holidays, accomplishments, 
and other special occasions. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Shirley Faye Edwards 
French for her dedication in serving her com-
munity.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE ARGYLE 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
BOYS’ 
BASKET-
BALL TEAM 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Argyle High School 
Boys’ Basketball Team for their commendable 
victory at the Division 4A state championship. 
The Argyle Eagles, through their laudable 
dedication and perseverance, qualified to com-
pete in their UIL conference’s state champion-
ship in March 2021. With their impressive per-
formance at the final match against Huffman 
Hargrave High School at the Alamodome in 
San Antonio, Texas, the team secured the 
state title for the second time in its history. 
Led by Head Basketball Coach Russell Per-
kins and MVP Skylar McCurry, the Eagles’ 
near perfect 29–1 game season culminated in 
their notable state victory. It is my pleasure to 
congratulate them on their stellar repeat 
championship. 
The Argyle High School Boys’ Basketball 
team exhibited remarkable teamwork, sports-
manship and camaraderie amidst the chal-
lenges brought about by a challenging year. I 
applaud each player, coach, and coordinator 
for their exemplary efforts and congratulate 
them for attaining their goals in the 2020–2021 
basketball season. I wish every one of them 
continued success in their future athletic, edu-
cational and professional endeavors.

Jr., and Nicole D. Collier who affectionately 
called her Momma. They moved to Northern 
Virginia where they settled their family in Dale 
City. 
Shirley’s strong faith led them to Little Union 
Baptist Church in Dumfries, VA. There, she 
was an integral part of the Children’s Ministry 
and quickly became a beloved favorite of the 
local children. Shirley loved to play softball 
and volleyball and encouraged her children to 
enjoy sports as well. 
Shirley and Rolland Sr.’s children supplied 
them with 9 grandchildren who all referred to 
Shirley as Nana. They became the object of 
her affection and often the grandchildren 
would be found at Nana’s while she whipped 
up her famous oatmeal cookies or delicious 
macaroni and cheese. Always generous with 
her time, Shirley could be seen shuffling the 
grandchildren from place to place and she 
was always present for pivotal moments in 
their life. The close bond that they shared did 
not falter when they teased that Nana had ‘‘no 
filter’’ later in life, when she shared her opinion 
about their choice of clothes or hair style. 
Shirley’s faith was only strengthened when 
she was diagnosed with cancer in 2011, with 
a 25 percent chance to live. Arising from the 
debilitating treatment, she even surprised 
medical professionals with her amazing cour-
age, faith, and strength. 
However, as the years went by, the rem-
nants of chemotherapy and twice a day radi-
ation took a toll on her body. Gradually losing 
strength but always maintaining her sharp 
mind, her beloved husband took on the task of 
giving her the best love and attentive care 
only he could provide. Cameron, her grand-
daughter spent countless days and hours as-
sisting Nana towards the end of her life and 
was always able to bring a smile to her face 
or make her laugh even when the days were 
long and hard. 
On August 29, 2021, phrases like ‘‘please 
don’t go Momma,’’ or ‘‘today was not your 
day, Nana’’ were spoken but God had a dif-
ferent plan and called her home to Glory. She 
is now reunited with her parents Helen and 
Thomas Joyner, her sisters Gladys, Mary, and 
Willie Mae, her brothers Walter, Lewis and 
Donald and other loving family members. 
Shirley leaves behind a legacy of love and 
precious memories to be cherished by her rel-
atives, friends, and community. Shirley’s love 
and unwavering commitment to faith and fam-
ily will be deeply missed by our Fort Worth 
community.

IN RECOGNITION OF OLYMPIC 
MEDALIST BUBBA STARLING 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Bubba Starling for 
earning a silver medal as part of the United 
States national baseball team in the 2020 
Tokyo Olympic Games. With every inning, he 
demonstrated his determination, passion, and 
love of baseball. I am proud to say that a local 
Kansan was a part of this very special team. 
Mr. Starling began his athletic career in 
Gardner, Kansas as a multi-sport standout 
athlete. Through baseball, he found his profes-
sional calling and, after being ranked in 2011 
as the number I baseball recruit in the nation, 
was selected fifth overall in the Major League 
Baseball draft by his hometown team, the 
Kansas City Royals. 
Given Mr. Starling’s history of athletic 
achievement, it is no surprise that he would 
excel on the world’s biggest stage as a part of 
the United States Olympic baseball team. 
Considering the special circumstances of 
these Olympics, it is even more impressive 
how Mr. Starling and his teammates rose to 
win the silver medal. Their perseverance 
through the pandemic was a beacon of hope 
in difficult times for our country and the world. 
I commend their resilience and demonstration 
of athletic excellence. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Bubba Starling on his silver medal 
in the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games.

HONORING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY 
OF MR. PAUL CATALANO 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate and honor the 100th 
birthday of Mr. Paul Catalano. 
Mr. Catalano is a proud lifelong Western 
New York resident. He was born and raised in 
Buffalo, New York, where he resided for most 
of his life. 
Mr. Catalano is a member of the Greatest 
Generation and fought for our country in World 
War II, serving in the U.S. Army from 1942 
until 1944 when he was honorably discharged 
as a Private First Class. After the war, he con-
tinued his service to our country as a Lieuten-
ant in the National Guard. He also had a long 
and productive career in the Buffalo banking 
and retail industries and retired in 1991 from 
Riverside Credit Union. 
Mr. Catalano and his late wife, Theresa, 
were happily married for 66 years. Mr. 
Catalano is the proud patriarch of his large 
family consisting of 3 children, 6 grand-
children, and 8 great-grandchildren. 
Mr. Catalano is proud of his Italian heritage, 
as demonstrated by his membership in the 
Federation of Italian American Societies of 
Western New York. He served as treasurer for 
the Federation for several decades, until retir-
ing at the age of 98. 
Mr. Catalano is also a lifelong New York 
Yankees fan and was privileged to see them 
play in his hometown of Buffalo at the age of 
99. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Mr. Paul Catalano for his service to our coun-
try and in celebration of his 100th birthday.

CELEBRATING THE 150TH CHURCH 
ANNIVERSARY OF ZION TRAV-
ELER CHURCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy and 
service of a remarkable church, Greater Zion 
Travelers M.B. Church. 
Zion Traveler Church was organized on the 
31st of July 1871 by Reverend Albert Young. 
Zion Travelers started out with just 30 mem-
bers and since its founding has only had 13 
Pastors: Rev. E.D. Jones, Rev. S.S. Butler, 
Rev. A.R. Tillman, Rev. J. West, Rev. Hue 
White, Rev. Henderson, Rev. Albert (Abe) 
Richie, Rev. C.J. Stevenson, Rev. U.E. Jones, 
Rev. C.H. Lowe, Rev. Willie Lewis, and Rev. 
Casey Fisher. 
Rev. Lewis was elected as pastor in Feb-
ruary 1967. One year into his stewardship, the 
congregation built a brick building with central 
heat, central air, two restrooms, running water, 
and a baptismal pool. This new building sym-
bolized new beginnings for the church and 
thus led to its renaming: Greater Zion Trav-
elers M.B. Church. Officers who served under 
him were Bro. Eugene Snow, Bro. Ivory Smith, 
Brother Hubert Smith, Bro. Sylvester Fields, 
Bro. Eddie Cooper, Bro. Louis McGriggs, and 
Bro. Talmadge Ross. Later, he added, Bro. 
Excell Snow, Bro. Robert Marbra, Bro. Upson, 
Bro. Claude Smith, Bro. James Simon, and 
Bro. Demell McGriggs. Trustees: Sis. Willie M. 
Callahan and Bro. C.P. Lyons. 
The members were so dedicated that they 
paid the mortgage off in only 10 years. They 
continued to build upon that success by pur-
chasing an organ, new pews with cushion 
seats, piano, bulletin board, desk, and chairs. 
Greater Zion was the only church at this time 
that had an asphalt parking lot. Rev. Lewis be-
came Pastor Emeritus in May 2013. He died 
October 10, 2013, as the longest serving pas-
tor of Greater Zion with 46 years. 
Rev. Fisher, the son of Sharkey and the 
Late Katie Fisher, was elected pastor of 
Greater Zion May 2013. Rev. Fisher was 
reared in this church and brought excitement 
with his selection. He has continued the leg-
acy of Greater Zion through area beautifi-
cation, (installing the embossed name on the 
church, added three crosses at the entrance 
of the church), building renovations (removed 
carpet and replaced with treated concrete 
flooring, replaced carpet in the choir loft, pur-
chased new furniture for the quiet room, Pas-
tor’s office, business office, and fellowship 
hall) and modernization. In honor of Reverend 
Lewis, Pastor Fisher dedicated the rear church 
entrance as the Willie Lewis Lane. He insti-
tuted the Church’s first and only motto: ‘‘The 
Church on the Corner where Christ is the 
Center’’. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, Greater 
Zion has been a leader in providing much 
needed food and cleaning supplies to the 
community. In May 2020, Greater Zion 
partnered with local, county, and state elected 
officials to conduct Operation Give Back-Utica. 
Over 300 families were blessed. During the 
historic ice storm of 2021, Rev. Fisher and his 
members coordinated with State Representa-
tive Stephanie Foster for water distribution for 
the community. Six pallets (504 cases) of 
water were distributed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the legacy, and service of 
Greater Zion Travelers M.B. Church.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SENATOR 
DAN SWECKER 
HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor and celebrate the life 
of Senator Dan Swecker. I had the distinct 
privilege of serving with Dan in the Wash-
ington State Legislature and I remain incred-
ibly grateful for his commitment to his country, 
his family and the communities of Southwest 
Washington. 
While many individuals in our region came 
to know Dan as a long-time elected official, his 
service to our nation began much earlier in 
life. A proud Army veteran, Dan celebrated his 
21st birthday while on a combat tour in Viet-
nam, where he sustained injuries and for his 
sacrifice earned the distinguished Purple 
Heart. 
It would be incomplete to talk about Dan’s 
public service without mentioning that which 
provided him consistent strength throughout 
his life, his Christian faith. Dan’s faith led him 
to become a founding member of the Centralia 
Christian School Foundation. It was this faith 
that led to a reputation as a man who would 
stand by his morals, even when that was not 
the easy thing to do. 
In so many ways, Dan personified a model 
community member. He was a kind, and hum-
ble leader, fueled by a desire to serve his 
neighbors and support his community. South-
west Washington was lucky to have a leader 
like Dan as a part of our community. 
Dan will be dearly missed by his family and 
many friends, and my thoughts and prayers 
remain with his loved ones during this difficult 
time.

IN HONOR OF AMERICAN LIBRARY 
ASSOCIATION 
PRESIDENT 
JU-
LIUS JEFFERSON 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and congratulate Julius C. Jeffer-
son, Jr., for his service this past year as the 
national president of the American Library As-
sociation (ALA). A fourth-generation native of 
Washington, D.C., Julius received his bach-
elor’s degree in history from Howard Univer-
sity and his master’s degree in library science 
from the University of Maryland. As a librarian, 
Mr. Jefferson has spent his career committed 
to advocacy, information policy, diversity, eq-
uity and inclusion and professional and leader-
ship development. In recognition of his leader-
ship and dedication to librarianship, the mem-
bers of the ALA elected Mr. Jefferson to be 
their 2020–2021 president. 
Like so many of us, libraries have had to 
adapt to changing circumstances during the 
pandemic, and Julius provided extraordinary 
leadership throughout this time. Mr. Jefferson 
began his term as ALA president with a virtual 
tour of 12 libraries. The ‘‘Holding Space’’ tour 
is what he called a series of virtual conversa-
tions that highlighted the innovation and im-
pact of a diverse range of libraries around the 
nation. The ‘‘Holding Space’’ tour engaged 
stakeholders, including elected officials at 
every level of government, to advocate for li-
braries and the communities they serve. 
I note that many of us in Congress benefit 
directly from the work of Mr. Jefferson, who 
serves as a section head of the Congressional 
Research Service at the Library of Congress. 
Mr. Jefferson has also served as president of 
the national Freedom to Read Foundation and 
of the Washington, D.C. Library Association. 
As a member of several boards, including the 
Black Caucus of the American Library Asso-
ciation, Mr. Jefferson has worked to diversify 
the profession of librarianship and elevate the 
principles of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Once again, I want to congratulate Julius 
Jefferson on his term as President of the 
American Library Association.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF CARTER 
CONLEY 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of 
Captain Carter Conley, founding member and 
leader of the Magoffin County Rescue Squad 
in Salyersville, Kentucky where he dedicated 
nearly 50 years to serving and protecting the 
community he loved. 
Carter made a decision immediately after 
graduating from the University of Kentucky, 
nearly five decades ago, to return home to 
use his bachelor’s degree in Early Education, 
where he would raise a wonderful family and 
make an impact on his small hometown by 
also pursuing his dream of becoming a fire-
fighter and certified EMT. Hard work was 
never a foreign term to Carter—he lived and 
breathed it, from working his way through col-
lege, to uniting a group of community leaders 
to form the Magoffin County Rescue Squad in 
1974. The squad started off with 10 members, 
$100.00, and the mountain ingenuity it takes 
to raise enough money to purchase and refur-
bish an old bread truck and two old boats from 
the Jenny Wiley State Park for the rescue 
squad’s first fleet. Thanks to coal severance 
dollars and the support of the local fiscal 
court, the rescue squad began to grow, and 
became essential to emergency response dur-
ing the flood of 1978. Carter and the squad 
ramped up fundraising efforts over the years, 
taking their pleas to the local newspaper, the 
radio station, and eventually a live televised 
auction. As a direct result of their tireless ef-
forts, the people of Magoffin County are safer 
today than ever before. 
In addition to his volunteer work with the 
Magoffin County Rescue Squad, he worked at 
Mountain Comprehensive Care; he served as 
an Assistant Fire Chief 1982 to 1985; he was 
a Level 1 Fire instructor through the Kentucky 
Fire Commission; and worked at Big Sandy 
Area Development District as a case manager 
in aging services for over 15 years. Carter’s 
impact on Magoffin County is widespread and 
deeply rooted. 
As we survey the impact of COVID–19 in 
our communities, we must look beyond the 
statistics and see the lives of beloved individ-
uals like Captain Carter Conley, who lost an 
unpredictable battle, despite his efforts to save 
others from the same deadly virus. 
My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our deepest 
heartfelt condolences to his wife, Vivian and 
the entire Conley family. Capt. Conley was a 
true hometown hero, and although his watch 
is finally over, I am confident that his great 
host of family and friends will continue to keep 
his memory alive.

DEDICATING THE MICHAEL J. 
LYNCH MEMORIAL GARDEN 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to commend to the House the memory of 
Special Agent Michael J. Lynch of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. Special Agent Lynch 
was killed in the line of duty in Ohio nearly 
four decades ago. 
Michael Lynch was raised in St. Marys, 
Ohio. An Air Force veteran of the Vietnam 
War, 
where 
he 
served 
as 
a 
C–130 
loadmaster, he was awarded the Distinguished 
Flying Cross for successfully completing a crit-
ical resupply mission over Khe Sanh in Feb-
ruary of 1968. 
Special Agent Lynch joined the FBI in 1976, 
assigned first to the Indianapolis division and 
later to Chicago, where he was part of the 
SWAT team. On December 16, 1982, he and 
three other agents lost their lives in an air-
plane accident while investigating a bank fraud 
and embezzlement case near Cincinnati. 
Tomorrow, at a site just a few blocks away 
from his childhood home, the Michael J. Lynch 
Memorial Garden will be dedicated in St. 
Marys. On behalf of the people of Ohio’s 
Fourth Congressional District, I offer my con-
dolences to his family, friends, and FBI col-
leagues as they gather to celebrate his self-
less service to our nation. I am grateful to the 
men and women of the FBI for pursuing this 
honor in tribute to their fallen comrade and 
thank the leaders and residents of St. Marys 
for making it a reality.

IN MEMORY OF EVERETT MAYOR 
BOB ANDERSON 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the life and distinguished ca-
reer of Everett Mayor Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Carl An-
derson, the city’s first mayor under its modern 
charter, who passed away on July 8, 2021. 
Mayor Anderson was instrumental in estab-
lishing the Boeing 747 ‘‘Jumbo Jet’’ plant at 
Everett’s Paine Field in the late-1960s, which 
has had a lasting impact on the local economy 
for 50 years. 
Bob Anderson was born on July 11, 1929, 
in Portland, Oregon to Carl John Anderson 
and Helen Anderson. He spent most of his 
childhood in Seattle before later moving to 
Everett. 
He graduated from Roosevelt High School 
in Seattle and the University of Washington,

where he met his wife, Dona. Bob and Dona 
were married in 1950 and raised four children

Bob served in the Navy for six years during 
the Korean War. 
He was elected Mayor of Everett in 1968 
and served until he became an executive of 
the Olympic Bank in 1977. 
In 1978, he became the director of the 
Washington State Department of Commerce

He founded the Washington State China

dent, director and senior advisor. 
I would like to honor the life of Mayor Bob

important contributions to the development of 
Everett and the State of Washington.

HONORING EDNA JOLLEY COOPER 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant Mrs. Edna ‘‘Mickey’’ Jolley Coo-
per. 
Mrs. Cooper was born on December 11, 
1944, one of the most wonderful of Angels en-
tered into this world, born to Mr. Frank and 
Marie King Jolley. This Angel who walked, 
talked, and loved so sweetly was Edna Jolley, 
known affectionately to all as ‘‘Mickey.’’ 
Mrs. Cooper was raised in a Christian 
household and grew up among family in 
Pelahatchie, Mississippi, where she attended 
school until high school graduation. She would 
go on to enroll at Jackson State College, now 
known as Jackson State University, where she 
excelled completing three degrees: Bachelor 
of Science, Master of Education and Spe-
cialist. 
It was also at Jackson State that she met 
the love of her life, Myram E. Cooper whom 
she wed in 1965. They were joined at the hip 
living a complete and full life as they raised 
their sons, Keith and Montrel. 
Professionally, Mrs. Cooper was well re-
spected among her peers and was a dedi-
cated educator for more than fifty years. Her 
loving, kind spirit and commitment to edu-
cation touched and influenced the lives of chil-
dren throughout the state of Mississippi. She 
began her teaching career at Clarksdale Ele-
mentary. As her career progressed, she taught 
at Ridgeland Elementary School, Lee Elemen-
tary School and Wilkins Elementary where she 
eventually retired. 
Mrs. Cooper dedicated her life to Christ at 
an early age in her youth. She loved the Lord 
with all of her heart and was a devoted and 
active member of Lynch Street CME. She was 
also a member of many civic organizations in-
cluding the National Council of Negro Women. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the late Edna Jolley Cooper 
for her dedication to serving her community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF FREDERICK DAKOTA 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the life of Frederick Da-
kota, who passed away recently after a life-
time of service to our country and his fellow 
Michiganders. Through his constant dedica-
tion, tenacity, and leadership, Fred became an 
essential part of the Keweenaw Bay Indian 
Community, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, 
and the United States of America. 
Fred was born in Zeba, Michigan, on Sep-
tember 13, 1937, and was immediately wel-
comed into the Keweenaw Bay Indian Com-
munity. After attending L’Anse Area Schools, 
he went on to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps 
for six years and became one of the first M60 
machine gunners. Shortly after retiring from 
the USMC, Fred moved to Baraga, where he 
began his public service in 1968 as a 
Councilmember of the Keweenaw Bay Indian 
Community. He would go on to serve on the 
Council for fifty years, being elected Tribal 
Chairman on numerous occasions. Fred be-
came nationally renowned and respected as a 
Native American leader, being given the unof-
ficial title of the ‘‘Father of Indian gaming.’’ 
Fred passed away on September 17, 2021, 
at his home in Baraga, MI. He is missed dear-
ly by his family and friends, and his legacy will 
live on for generations to come. Fred’s tireless 
devotion to the KBIC community and the pub-
lic good improved the lives of countless Tribal 
members. The impact of his service as a truly 
passionate Native American leader cannot be 
overstated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life of Frederick Dakota. 
He will be forever remembered for the many 
lives he bettered through his tireless service.

HONORING RODERICK TOWNSEND 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing and cele-
brating Roderick Townsend for his record- 
breaking 
success 
at 
the 
Tokyo 
2020 
Paralympic Games. Born with nerve damage 
to his right arm and shoulder, Roderick’s in-
credible journey overcoming adversity has 
demonstrated that perseverance and hard 
work can lead to great achievements. 
Roderick, a native of Stockton, California, 
graduated from Lincoln High School. He dem-
onstrated his athletic prowess as a member of 
Lincoln High School’s varsity football team, 
where he was selected as the 2009 team cap-
tain, as well as a San Jose Athletic Associa-
tion first team defensive end and second team 
all-area player. Roderick later went on to at-
tend San Joaquin Delta College, where he 
competed in the decath and high jump. During 
the 2012 season, he was selected as the 
Delta College Track and Field Team captain 
and was ranked seventh in the nation and 
second in the state of California for his high 
jump performances. He still holds the Delta 
College high jump record and Delta College 
Track Facility record. Roderick went on to 
graduate from Boise State University and then 
received his Master of Education from North-
ern Arizona University. 
Making his international debut at the Ari-
zona Grand Prix in 2015, Roderick quickly 
made a name for himself on the international 
scene representing the United States in the 
World Championships in high jump, long jump, 
and triple jump. Roderick’s years of hard work 
culminated in him being selected to compete 
in his first Paralympic Games in 2016 in Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil, where he clinched double 
gold medals by winning both the long jump 
and high jump T47—setting Paralympic world 
records in both. 
Aspiring to reach even greater heights, Rod-
erick competed in the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic 
Games as a member of the United States 
Paralympics Track and Field Team. Once 
again having the honor to represent his coun-
try in the world’s foremost athletic competition, 
Roderick set the Paralympic world record by 
leaping 2.15 meters in the men’s high jump 
T47 and in doing so, earned his third gold 
medal to date. Additionally, he earned the sil-
ver medal and achieved his personal record of 
7.43 meters in the men’s long jump T47. 
Roderick also chose to put his years of ex-
perience to work serving the youth of his com-
munity as a track and field coach. He has 
coached at Delta College and Jim Elliott Chris-
tian High School in Lodi, California, and 
served as a sports performance coach at The 
Performance Project in Stockton. Roderick 
currently serves as a full-time assistant coach 
with the Northern Arizona University’s Men’s 
and Women’s Track and Field program. 
Roderick serves as an example for young 
athletes across this country, demonstrating 
that no matter your circumstances, with hard 
work you can achieve greatness. I’m honored 
to recognize Roderick Townsend for his distin-
guished athletic achievements and ask my col-
leagues to join me in wishing him the best of 
luck in his future competitions.

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Lewisville ISD Flower 
Mound High School Girls Soccer Team, the 
Jaguars, for their state championship victory at 
the UIL Division 6A Championship on April 16, 
2021. 
The Lady Jaguars, led by senior Riley 
Baker—a Kansas State signee voted MVP for 
the championship, junior Sydney Becerra—a 
Texas A&M signee, and Head Coach Misail 
Tsapos, secured the state title in a 2–1 game 
against Austin Vandergrift High School. The 
team is to be commended for the exemplary 
teamwork and sportsmanship practiced all 
season. I am proud to join our community in 
celebrating their noteworthy accomplishments. 
Though the Jaguars were heavily impacted 
by the challenges of the COVlD–19 pandemic, 
the team overcame and surpassed their obsta-
cles to attain its second state title. I applaud 
the grit and talent exhibited by each player. 
It is my privilege to recognize the out-
standing performance of the Flower Mound 
Jaguars in the 2020–2021 soccer season. I 
wish the players and coaches continued suc-
cess in future seasons, both on and off the 
playing field.

RECOGNIZING CONNIE BALLMER’S 
INCREDIBLE 
PHILANTHROPIC 
WORK 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Connie Ballmer for being 
the 2021 recipient of the YMCA’s A.K. Guy 
Award, which is presented to an individual 
with outstanding volunteer service and dedica-
tion to social responsibility and equity and jus-
tice for all. 
Connie Ballmer founded the Ballmer Group 
in 2015 with the mission of giving every child 
an equal chance to achieve the American 
dream. Since then, the Ballmer Group has 
worked diligently to remove economic barriers 
that prevent children from having equal access 
to education opportunities, housing, childcare, 
mental health resources, and healthcare. The 
Ballmer Groups has changed systems to allow 
every child to have equitable opportunities. 
Making these investments in our children now 
gives them the best chance at a successful fu-
ture. 
The Ballmer Group’s mission has become 
even more important over the course of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, as millions of families 
faced further economic strain. Without the in-
credible work of the Ballmer Group and the 
leadership of Mrs. Ballmer during COVID–19, 
many children would have completely lost ac-
cess to resources critical to their development. 
Under Connie’s leadership, the Ballmer 
Group has been able to drastically change the 
lives of the next generation for the better. 
From making improvements to the foster care 
system to expanding access to behavioral 
health systems, the Ballmer Group has been 
on the forefront of tackling childhood poverty 
and ensuring every child has an equal chance 
to succeed. 
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege today to 
thank Connie Ballmer for the enormous con-
tributions she has made to her community and 
congratulate her on being the 2021 recipient 
of the A.K. Guy Award.

HONORING THE CAREER AND 
SERVICE OF MR. JOE DRISKILL 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the service of Mr. Joe Driskill and con-
gratulate him on his retirement. 
I have had the pleasure of working with Joe 
over the years, and I have admired his dedica-
tion to advancing Missouri’s military priorities. 
Joe recently served as the first Military Advo-
cate for the State of Missouri, where he 
worked tirelessly to preserve and protect Mis-
souri’s military installation by coordinating ef-
forts between the state and federal govern-
ments. Joe ensured that the State of Missouri 
and the Congressional Delegation were al-
ways on the same page when it came to Mis-
souri’s military priorities. 
Prior to his role as the state’s Military Advo-
cate, Joe served as the executive director of 
both the Leonard Wood Institute and the Sus-
tainable Ozarks Partnership at Fort Leonard 
Wood. Joe dedicated his career to advancing 
opportunities at Fort Leonard Wood, and un-
derstood the strategic importance the installa-
tion has on the region, state, and Department 
of Defense. 
Joe’s leadership and expertise was also rec-
ognized at a national level. In 2019, Joe was 
elected as the President of the Board of Direc-
tors for the Association of Defense Commu-
nities. 
I thank Joe for his years of service to the 
state of Missouri. His leadership has made a 
difference. Congratulations on his retirement. 
It has been an honor working with him.

HONORING MINNIE PEARL 
CAMPBELL 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community servant Ms. Minnie Pearl Camp-
bell. 
Ms. Campbell was born in January 1967, in 
Doddsville, Mississippi, located in Sunflower 
County. Ms. Campbell currently resides in 
Indianola, MS. There she graduated from 
Gentry High School in 1985. In 2003, she at-
tended Superior Health Care, in Cleveland, 
MS, for her Certified Nursing Assistant certifi-
cation. Then, she went on to Mississippi Delta 
Community 
College 
(2004–2005) 
for 
coursework in Medical Billing. 
Ms. Campbell has worked in the health care 
industry since 2003. She said, ‘‘After grad-
uating from high school, I wasn’t sure of my 
career path, but I knew I wanted to help oth-
ers because of my disabled sister. My family 
worked hard to help her live a fulfilling life. 
Without my siblings and I making personal 
sacrifices I doubt if it would have been pos-
sible. We didn’t have many options around us 
for a good-quality-level health care assisted 
facility for people with limited financial re-
sources and family support in Indianola.’’ So 
eventually, Minnie and her sister (Maple L. 
Campbell) decided to establish one. 
In 2003, after receiving her nursing assistant 
certification, Ms. Campbell began working for 
the North Sunflower County Hospital as a Cer-
tified Nursing Assistant in Ruleville, MS. This 
position required her to assist patients with 
daily living skills, monitor patient vitals, assist 
with physical therapy, and manage flow chart 
records of patients. After leaving the hospital 
and because of her skills, knowledge, and 
training, Ms. Campbell cared for patients in 
the privacy of their homes as their personal 
Adult Care Provider under direction and co-
ordination of care with a medical provider. As 
an Adult Care Provider, she has worked for 
Southern Health Care (2004 to Present), Ox-
ford Health Care (2010 to Present), and Pri-
vate Care (2012 to 2015). 
In 2016, Ms. Campbell and her sister, Maple 
L. Campbell, started the Platinum Plus Care 
Assisted Living Facility at 617 Highway 82 
West, Indianola, MS. Ms. Campbell is the 
COO and Administrator. The Campbell sisters 
made history, becoming the first Black/Black 
female owned and operated full-time assisted 
living facility in Indianola. Platinum Care Plus 
Assisted Living Facility is a twenty-seven-bed 
facility that offers 24-hours and 365 days a 
year of care to veterans and elderly adults. It 
provides care in the areas of administering 
and monitoring of medication, personal care 
(bathing and dressing), transportation and per-
sonal assistance at medical appointments, 
care coordination with medical providers, so-
cial and recreational activities, housekeeping 
and laundry, exercise, nutritious and health 
meals, a social and engaging environment, 
and more. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Minnie Pearl Campbell 
for her dedication to being a public servant in 
the health care industry.

TRIBUTE TO DAVID PATTEN, JR. 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a servant leader, pro-
fessional athlete, and a son of South Carolina. 
David Patten, Jr., from Columbia, South Caro-
lina, passed away on September 2, 2021 at 
the age of 47. He was taken from us too soon 
but lived his life as an example for others to 
follow and his legacy will live on in the count-
less number of people he touched. 
David was born the third of four children to 
David Patten, Sr., and Betty Williams Patten. 
He was a football stand out at Lower Richland 
High School and earned a full scholarship to 
play at Western Carolina University. 
When he left college, David was passed 
over by the National Football League (NFL) 
because of his small stature. But what he 
didn’t have in size, he made up for in deter-
mination. While working in a coffee bean fac-
tory, he trained hard to achieve his goal of be-
coming an NFL player and spent time playing 
in the Canadian and Arena Football Leagues. 
His big break came at a University of South 
Carolina Pro Timing Day, when the New York 
Giants extended him an invitation to try out. 
The rest is history. 
David went on to have a successful 12-year 
career as a receiver in the NFL, where he 
earned three Super Bowl rings. He is best re-
membered for making two iconic catches to 
help the New England Patriots win their first 
Super Bowl in 2001. Over the course of his 
career, David played for the New York Giants 
(1997 to 1999), Cleveland Browns (2000), 
New England Patriots (2001 to 2004), Wash-
ington Redskins (2005 to 2006), and the New 
Orleans Saints (2007 to 2008). He played in 
147 NFL games, caught 324 passes for 4,715 
yards and scored 24 touchdowns. 
His motto ‘‘maximum effort’’ grew from his 
philosophy that one must work hard to be the 
best at whatever he pursued. When he retired 
from the NFL, David applied his motto to fin-
ishing his degree in social work at Western 
Carolina. He became an ordained minister in 
2013. He also became a property investor, 
renovator, and landscaper, all while applying 
his motto, ‘‘maximum effort’’ to his life experi-
ences. 
David was a powerful motivational speaker. 
The driving force in his life was his Christian 
faith, and he became well known for his mis-
sion to be an ambassador for Christ. David

sweetheart, 
Galiena 
Hardy, and they were a devoted couple for 24 
years. They established the ‘‘A Way of Life’’ 
(AWOL) Ministries. Together they sought to

David leaves to mourn his wife and their 
four children, David III, Daquan, Quinton, and 
Mia, his parents, siblings and extended family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the life of 
David Patten, Jr. President Abraham Lincoln is 
purported to have said, ‘‘It’s not the years in 
your life that count. It’s the life in your years.’’ 
I believe this to be fitting for David. He lived 
a significant and meaningful life, and we are 
all better for having had him among us.

RECOGNIZING THE FRESNO COUN-
TY 
ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT 
CORPORATION 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the fortieth anniversary of 
the Fresno County Economic Development 
Corporation (EDC) and their efforts to expand 
economic growth, investment, and prosperity 
in Fresno County. 
The EDC was established in 1981 to pro-
mote job and business growth in Fresno 
County. Efforts have included marketing Fres-
no County as the premier location to grow 
core industries, facilitating state selection for 
companies new to the county, and assisting in 
retaining and expanding local businesses. The 
organization has also supported local business 
by publishing reports, hosting annual events, 
promoting networking opportunities, and shar-
ing resources and information to clients and 
stakeholders. 
Since its foundation, the EDC has main-
tained a commitment to excellence and inno-
vation. The EDC was awarded the 2018 Inter-
national Economic Development Council Gold 
Award for the New Employment Opportunities 
(NEO) Expanded Subsidized Employment pro-
gram. 
The Fresno County Economic Development 
Corporation has played a vital role in growth 
and success of business in Fresno County 
and is committed to solidifying the economic 
strength of the county into the future. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing the 
EDC’s fortieth anniversary and recognizing 
their contributions to the Fresno County com-
munity.

HONORING THE BALE GRIST MILL 
STATE HISTORIC PARK 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Bale Grist 
Mill as it celebrates its 175th Anniversary. 
The Bale Grist Mill was founded in 1846 by 
Dr. Edward Turner Bale. It was given to Dr. 
Bale with a land grant from the Mexican gov-
ernment and remained in operation until the 
early 1900s. The mill’s longevity was not only 
a credit to Dr. Bale, but also his wife, Maria 
Soberanes. Under Maria’s management, the 
Bale Grist Mill became extremely prosperous, 
and she became one of the wealthiest women 
in Napa Valley. 
Powered by a 36-foot-tall waterwheel, the 
Bale Grist Mill converted grains and corn into 
more usable meals and flours for breads and 
other food. For the pioneers, the Mill was a 
technological wonder, and it significantly sim-
plified the grain conversion process. The Bale 
Grist Mill was especially known for producing 
the best meals and flours for cornbread, yel-
low bread, shortening bread, and spoon 
bread. This technological innovation also 
served as an important social center for farm-
ers and settlers who gathered to convert their 
crops for consumption in Napa Valley. 
With funding from the Napa Valley State 
Parks Association, and the help and support 
of local vintners Dario Sattui and the late Hol-
brook Mitchell, as well as the advocacy of the 
late Ranger Sandy Jones, Millwright Rob 
Grassi restored the mill’s water wheel in 2019 
and 2020. This endeavor earned Mr. Grassi 
the Preservationist of the Year Award from 
Napa County Landmarks. Now, the Bale Grist 
Mill is a protected State Historic Landmark op-
erated by the Napa Valley State Parks Asso-
ciation in partnership with Napa Open Space. 
The Bale Grist Mill State Historic Park main-
tains one of the few remaining functioning 
mills in the United States, and houses the first 
church founded in Napa Valley and the Pio-
neer cemetery. The park is open to visitors 
and offers educational activities, tours, special 
events, and milling demonstrations for the 
public. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that the 
Bale Grist Mill was a pioneering technological 
advancement for Napa Valley. It is therefore, 
fitting and proper that we honor it here today.

HONORING THE WORLD WAR II, 
KOREAN 
WAR, 
AND 
VIETNAM 
WAR VETERANS OF ILLINOIS 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the World War II, Korean War, and Viet-
nam War Veterans who traveled to Wash-
ington, D.C. on September 16, 2021 with 
Honor Flight Chicago, a program that provides 
World War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War 
veterans the opportunity to visit their memo-
rials on The National Mall in Washington, D.C. 
These memorials were built to honor their 
courage and service to their country. 
The American Veteran is one of our great-
est treasures. The Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, 
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled 
here on September 16th answered our na-
tion’s call to service during one of its greatest 
times of need. From the European Campaign 
to the Pacific Asian Theatre to the African 
Theater, these brave Americans risked life and 
limb, gave service and sacrificed much, all 
while embodying what it is to be a hero. We 
owe them more gratitude than can ever be ex-
pressed. 
I welcome these brave veterans to Wash-
ington and to their memorials. I am proud to 
include in the RECORD the names of these 
men and women for all to see, hear, and rec-
ognize, and I call on my colleagues to rise and 
join me in expressing gratitude.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the 100th birthday of Ms. 
Marianne Weingarten. 
Marianne Lilli Katz Weingarten was born in 
Germany in 1921. At age 14, she was sent to 
Spain to live with her aunt and uncle, but four 
months after she arrived, the Spanish Civil 
War broke out and she was forced to return to 
Germany. 
Marianne and her parents fled Nazi Ger-
many in 1938 and immigrated to the United 
States. She worked with the Jewish Emigre 
service in Seattle during the war, taking immi-
grants off boats and helping them on their 
next steps in their new country.

CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF DR. VOLETTA WILLIAMS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy and 
service of a remarkable leader, Dr. Voletta 
Williams. 
Dr. Williams is happy to conclude her edu-
cational career on a high note. The outgoing 
chair and professor for the Department of Bio-
logical Sciences retired after a 32-year career. 
Dr. Williams’ dedication has led her to pro-
motions to chair in 2016, interim chair in 2015, 
professor in 2013, and associate professor in 
2006. Before being granted tenure in 2007, 
Dr. Williams was an adjunct instructor. 
Forever grateful for such a milestone, Dr. 
Williams will miss teaching and preparing the 
next generation of scientist for success. She 
doesn’t plan to slow down just yet. Her future 
includes assisting her beloved Alcorn State 
University, committing to church activities, and 
enjoying her family. She plans to continue to 
contribute to Alcorn as needed or requested. 
Her goal now is to explore avenues to serve 
our multicultural students better, improve 
STEM areas at Alcorn, spend quality time with 
family, expand church projects, and remain a 
mother figure to many students as well as her 
children and grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the legacy, and service of Dr. 
Voletta Williams as she celebrates retirement

IN REMEMBRANCE OF CHIEF 
ROLAND ASEBEDO 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished public service 
of Chief Roland Asebedo, the Fire Marshall 
and Director of Development and Emergency 
Services for Denton County. After a profes-
sional life devoted to protecting and serving 
the community, Chief Asebedo passed away 
on September 13, 2021, at the age of 56 after 
a courageous battle with COVID–19. 
Chief Asebedo obtained his Master Peace 
Officer certification in 1998 and his Associates 
Degree from South Plains College in 2002. 
Originally 
from 
Silverton, 
Texas, 
Chief 
Asebedo began his tenure with Denton County 
Emergency Services in 2004. 
Over the course of his fire service career, 
Chief Asebedo served as the Fire Chief of 
Highland Village, the Fire Marshall of Coppell, 
and the Assistant Fire Chief and Fire Marshall 
with the Plainview/EMS department. His ex-
pertise and dedication to ensuring North Tex-
ans’ safety led to his appointment as the Den-
ton County Fire Marshal and Director of De-
velopment and Emergency Services in 2020. 
Chief Asebedo’s career in emergency serv-
ices spanned 30 years, and his efforts have 
saved and safeguarded innumerable lives in 
our community. Denton County has lost an un-
paralleled 
public 
servant 
with 
Roland 
Asebedo’s passing. The civic virtues of com-
passion, professionalism and selflessness 
demonstrated by Chief Asebedo will inspire 
his Denton County and North Texas col-

standard of conduct that characterized his 
meritorious career. I join the friends, family, 
and colleagues of Roland Asebedo in mourn-
ing his loss and honoring his legacy.

Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise

Mary is part of the heartbeat of Columbus. 
Serving as the longtime Executive Secretary

She is an accomplished woman of God, a

ERLY BOLING 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Horizon Credit Union’s Presi-
dent/CEO Beverly Boling who has announced 
her plans to retire this year after 42 years of 
service to members of the credit union. Her 
retirement will be effective September 30, 
2021. 
Boling began her career in 1979 at what 
was then the Municipal Employees Credit 
Union, in the basement of the former city hall 
on Center Street. During her tenure, she has 
seen the credit union grow from having under 
$500,000 in assets to $65 million. She was in-
strumental in the 1999 merger of Kingsport 
Postal and Federal Credit Union to form First 
Kingsport Credit Union, which then merged 
with AGC Credit Union in 2014 to create Hori-
zon Credit Union. Boling also worked to intro-
duce many of the innovations customers now 
see as common place to Horizon Credit 
Union, including debit cards and credit union- 
owned ATMs. 
The credit union industry and the local com-
munity have also benefited greatly from 
Boling’s desire to help others. She served on 
the Tennessee Credit Union League Board 
and in the Upper East Tennessee Chapter of 
Credit Unions. Currently, she volunteers her 
time and expertise as Treasurer of the Boys 
and Girls Club of Greater Kingsport and Chair-
man of the Mount Carmel Block Party. 
When Boling started at the credit union, she 
was the second full-time employee ever. Now, 
she leaves Horizon Credit Union in the hands 
of a tenured, capable team of people. 
After she retires, Boling will embark on a life 
of adventure and exploration. Her plans in-
clude boarding a catamaran with Mr. Dana, 
her husband, and sailing to the Caribbean, Fiji 
and beyond.

HONORING 
THE 
25TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE GEORGIA FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLE GROWERS AS-
SOCIATION 
HON. A. DREW FERGUSON IV 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 20, 2021 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the Georgia 
Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, 
which celebrated its 25th anniversary in Au-
gust. For the past 25 years, the association 
has solidified itself as the premier resource to 
represent the fruit and vegetable industry in 
Georgia—a sector that is essential to Geor-
gia’s economy and prosperity. 
By providing services such as education 
programs to maximize production, marketing 
opportunities to increase profits, and disaster 
management tools to handle natural disasters 
and crises, the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable 
Growers Association is without question a cor-
nerstone of the Georgia ag industry and a 
boon to specialty crop growers across the 
state. 
The association has instituted a multitude of 
innovative solutions aimed toward helping its 
members. They have worked diligently with 
national organizations and congressional of-
fices 
to 
secure 
relief 
aid 
through 
the 
Coronavirus Food and Assistance Program 
and implemented modern strategies aimed to-
ward strengthening Georgia’s specialty grow-
ers. 
As the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Grow-
ers Association rounds out 25 years, I look 
forward to a bright future of continued strength 
and advocacy, and I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating this association’s great ac-
complishments.
