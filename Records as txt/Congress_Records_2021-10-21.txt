REMEMBERING GENERAL COLIN 
POWELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, this 
week, our country lost a great Amer-
ican, and I stand here today to remem-
ber a giant: General Colin Powell. 
He was a statesman who loved his 
country fiercely. He was a trailblazer 
who served with love, integrity, and 
pride. He helped shape American for-
eign and military policy for years. He 
believed public service was the most 
important job in the world. 
His leadership, full of honesty and 
listening, 
inspired 
generations. 
He 
treated every person with dignity and 
respect. Until his dying day, he op-
posed the fear and the hatred dividing 
this country. He believed in America’s 
promise, and he left that as his legacy. 
He stood on principle and believed in 
the good of life. 
Today, we remember his steadfast 
leadership, his commitment to family, 
and his strong enduring presence. 
Please join me in sending love and 
prayers to Alma and the Powell family 
in the difficult times ahead. 
I close with some of the General’s 
own wisdom: ‘‘The ties that bind us to-
gether are far stronger than the occa-
sional stresses that separate us.’’ 
f 
HONORING NATIONAL SPINA 
BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. HERN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise in honor of National Spina Bifida 
Awareness Month. 
Spina bifida is a rare condition that 
develops in the womb. It stems from a 
hole in the spinal cord, a condition 
known as a neural tube defect. As the 
spinal column fails to close properly, 
nearly every major organ system is im-
pacted. 
Children born with spina bifida typi-
cally undergo dozens of surgeries at a 
young age. For those who survive to 
adulthood, they live with complex 
physical, mental, and other health 
challenges. 
There are precious few resources 
available for the 166,000 individuals liv-
ing with spina bifida in the United 
States, including my sister and my 
niece. I have another sister who was 
born with spina bifida as well and 
passed away shortly after birth. 
I am very familiar with the chal-
lenges faced by those who suffer from 
spina bifida. It has been a part of my 
life since childhood. 
The medical community has taken 
many steps forward since my sisters 
were diagnosed with spina bifida sev-
eral decades ago. Whereas spina bifida 
used to be a childhood death sentence, 
many individuals with spina bifida are 
living well into adulthood, a tremen-
dous milestone. But there is more we 
can do. 
Funding for spina bifida is low. There 
is only one entity in the Federal Gov-
ernment studying spina bifida. It is the 
Spina Bifida Program at the National 
Center on Birth Defects and Develop-
mental Disabilities at the CDC. 
Americans living with spina bifida 
deserve the same respect and dignity in 
life as everyone else. Spina bifida re-
search needs dedicated funding to en-
sure a better future for Americans with 
spina bifida. 
REMEMBERING PAT CAMPBELL 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of Pat Campbell, a friend 
not only to me but to many Oklaho-
mans who listened to him on the radio 
every morning. 
Pat passed away yesterday morning 
after a long fight with brain cancer. 
Everyone who knew Pat knows he was 
a fighter. 
Pat got his start on radio largely on 
accident, because he would call in and 
debate a liberal radio host. The station 
was so impressed with his calls that 
they gave him his own show. 
After that, he became a regular guest 
of Tucker Carlson’s on MSNBC and 
would go on to be a guest commentator 
on shows like ‘‘The O’Reilly Factor’’ 
and ‘‘Fox and Friends.’’ 
Pat had an extraordinary impact on 
radio, not only in Tulsa but around the 
Nation. He was a passionate voice for 
conservative values and a truly great 
friend.

RECOGNIZING HISPANIC HERITAGE 
MONTH AND LATINA EQUAL PAY 
DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Ms. BOURDEAUX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today, October 21, to recognize 
Latina Equal Pay Day, the day when 
the pay for Latina women catches up 
to that of White men from the previous 
year. Latinas typically earn only 57 
cents for every dollar earned by White 
men. 
This disparity harms women, their 
families, and the communities that de-
pend on their wages for survival. This 
inequity is why I am a proud cosponsor 
of H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, 
which would close loopholes in the 
Equal Pay Act in an effort to break the 
patterns of pay discrimination and 
strengthen workforce protections for 
women, especially women of color. 
I would also like to take this time on 
Latina Equal Pay Day to acknowledge 
the recent conclusion of Hispanic Her-
itage Month and to recognize and cele-
brate the many contributions, diverse 
cultures, and extensive histories of the 
American Hispanic community and the 
over 60 million Americans who identify 
as Hispanic or Latino. 
I am proud to represent one of the 
most diverse districts in the United 
States and the more than 170,000 His-
panic Americans who call Georgia’s 
Seventh District home. 
One of my most significant legisla-
tive accomplishments was borne out of 
conversations with Tony Rodriguez, 
CEO and president of the Aurora The-
ater in Lawrenceville. My conversa-
tions with him encouraged me to intro-
duce the Paycheck Protection Program 
Extension Act, which extended the 
deadline to apply for forgivable PPP 
loans from March 31 to May 31 and 
gave small businesses more time to ac-
cess this critical assistance. 
I would also like to recognize Anto-
nio Molina, chair of the board of Geor-
gia’s Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, 
for his hard work ensuring Hispanic 
small business owners have the re-
sources they need to be successful. 
I also recognize Santiago Marquez, 
the executive director of the Latin 
American Association, which provides 
a critical safety net service for so 
many in the Seventh District. 
I would also like to thank two His-
panic members of the Cabinet: Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
Xavier Becerra and SBA Administrator 
Isabel Guzman, who visited Georgia’s 
Seventh District this year. It was an 
honor to host each of them and intro-
duce them to the wonderful place we 
call home. 
Finally, I would like to acknowledge 
my chief of staff, Estefania ‘‘Stefy’’ 
Rodriguez, for her work leading my 
staff to serve the great people of the 
Seventh District. 
As I host and attend events across 
my district, I am struck by the vi-
brancy of the Hispanic communities. 
Recently, I visited with the Latino 
Lions Club of Norcross, the Latin 
American Association, the Hispanic 
Health 
Coalition 
of 
Georgia, 
and 
Latino Community Services to discuss 
how we can work together to address 
the issues that matter most to our 
community. 
We all benefit from the contributions 
Hispanic Americans have made and 
will continue to make. The inclusion of 
their voices and values in our commu-
nity make my district and the United 
States so much stronger. 
They are the scientists, doctors, 
nurses, and essential workers who have 
helped us get through the COVID–19 
pandemic; the teachers who educate 
the next generation of Americans; the 
artists who grace our television screens 
and our stages; the small business own-
ers who drive our economy; and the 
many Hispanic elected officials, some 
who walk these very halls, who work 
every day to make a positive difference 
for our community. 
I am a proud cosponsor of critical 
legislation, such as H.R. 6, the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act, and H.R. 
1603, the Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act, which extends the American 
Dream to millions of people who al-
ready call this great Nation home. 
Today, on Latina Equal Pay Day, and 
following the conclusion of Hispanic 
Heritage Month, I reaffirm my com-
mitment to always work to support 
and strengthen our vibrant Hispanic 
communities. 
f 
HORRIFIC EVENT ON SEPTA TRAIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to talk about something 
that apparently the person whose rep-
resentative serves in this Congress re-
fuses to talk about, and that is the hor-
rific events that occurred last Wednes-
day on a SEPTA train. 
‘‘SEPTA’’ stands for Southeast Pub-
lic Transit Authority. It is the transit 
system that runs around Philadelphia. 
Now, I don’t know whether folks in 
the House know it, but for nearly 40 
minutes, a woman on the train was 
harassed and groped before an illegal 
alien forcibly ripped off her clothes and 
raped her right there on the train, 
while up to 10 riders watched without 
intervening. They didn’t even bother to 
call the police. 
Imagine this. It actually gets worse. 
This hellacious experience continued 
as the train passed 20 train stations. 
Instead of taking action, other pas-
sengers watched and some actually are 
reported to have filmed the attack. 
It actually gets worse. The perpe-
trator of this horrific crime is here in 
our country illegally. Despite previous 
convictions of sexual abuse and drug 
crimes, he is another one that was re-
leased 
from 
immigration 
detention 
rather than being deported. 
Now, the severe emotional and phys-
ical trauma experienced by the victim 
could and should have been prevented 
by our elected officials, who often ad-
vocate for open borders and defunding 
the police. They have failed her, they 
have failed us, and they have created 
an environment where she was victim-
ized in front of others by a man who 
should have been deported years ago. 
While the man should have been de-
ported years ago, the man should not 
have been in our country in the first 
place. We have laws for these things, 
and we should enforce those laws so 
that this lady could live safely in her 
American city. 
This horrific crime raises questions 
and concerns about where we are as a 
Nation and how we got here. 
When my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle decide they want to speak 
on this floor and attack law enforce-
ment and denigrate our immigration 
officials, like the ones that were down 
at the border on horseback trying to 
enforce the laws that are passed in this 
very Chamber, and they actively seek 
to release dangerous criminals into so-
ciety, I wish they would realize that 
there are real human victims of their 
reckless, irresponsible, and absolutely 
dangerous policies and rhetoric. 
I hope the majority keeps this in 
mind as they continue to work on their 
$3.5 trillion spending bill that promises 
amnesty to dangerous criminals and 
puts Americans citizens in danger. 
That is what it does; Amnesty, letting 
criminals 
stay 
here 
without 
con-
sequence, without accountability. 
But there is accountability for this 
poor lady, I guarantee you that. 
Open borders, abolish ICE, no bail, 
and defund the police are not merely 
harmless catchphrases that Big-Gov-
ernment, socialist politicians can spew 
without consequence. That rhetoric re-
sults in horrific crimes against citizens 
that are someone’s constituent, some-
one who took an oath to the Constitu-
tion to defend this country and the 
citizens of this country. They are 
someone’s family member. This was 
someone’s daughter, someone’s little 
girl. 
I want to commend the off-duty 
SEPTA employee for having the cour-
age to step up and do the right thing, 
calling the police and ending the most 
horrific event of this young woman’s 
life. 
I also want to thank the SEPTA po-
lice officer—law enforcement. Yes, I 
want to thank law enforcement who in-
tervened and brought this nightmare 
to an end. 
But I do want to take a moment and 
ask my colleagues: How much more 
must we endure? 
There are so many others, so many 
other victims, from this side of the 
country to the other side: Kate Stienle

in California, killed by an illegal alien; 
Derek Kichline in Pennsylvania, far 
from the border, killed by the head of 
the Latin Kings in town; Mollie Tib-
betts, in the heartland of the country, 
killed by an illegal alien. Read the 
story about Nilsa Padilla, whose three 
little girls watched an illegal alien 
beat her to death, chop up her body, 
dispose of it, and then went on to kill 
their youngest sister, a little toddler. 
Then he left the country and was never 
brought to justice, as far as we know. 
How much longer? How many more? 
We have seen record numbers this year 
alone at the border of illegal aliens 
coming into our country and imper-
iling and endangering our citizens. It is 
our job. We take an oath to defend 
them. I think you get the point, 
Madam Speaker.

HONORING THE SACRIFICES OF 
JOHN EADE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a great American sol-
dier, Staff Sergeant John Eade, a na-
tive son of Toledo, Ohio, of whom our 
citizenry is very proud and eternally 
grateful. 
As our Nation approaches Veterans 
Day 2021, I enter into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD the poignant story to 
honor John and his treasured col-
leagues for their superhuman valor. 
They are all heroes. 
John, as a highly wounded Vietnam 
veteran, persevered and led a distin-
guished life as an architect and chief of 
the city of Boston’s inspection divi-
sion. 
Our Nation must revere his lifelong 
valor in the face of overwhelming odds, 
terrible slaughter, and wounds endured 
from the deadliest single-day battle in 
the Vietnam war. 
Sergeant Eade is held in the highest 
esteem by everyone who knows him. He 
is a trusted confidant, a faithful friend, 
a true patriot, and a very humble Pur-
ple Heart recipient. He would not seek 
that recognition for himself but would 
be thinking only of his comrades. 
In November 1965, John was deployed 
to Vietnam as a fire team leader in the 
ill-fated 2nd Platoon, Alpha Company, 
2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry 
Division. 
On November 14, he and his team 
were sent as reinforcements to the Bat-
tle at Landing Zone X-Ray in the la 
Drang Valley made famous by the 
movie ‘‘We Were Soldiers.’’ 
On the morning of November 17, Ser-
geant Eade and his small team were 
marching to Landing Zone Albany. 
Only minutes after arriving, two much 
larger North Vietnamese regiments 
ambushed his unit. 
As the North Vietnamese swarmed 
them through the trees, John’s platoon 
was pinned down in ferocious hand-to- 
hand combat. 
Sergeant Eade quickly rallied three 
of the only remaining soldiers able to 
fight: Wilbert Johnson, Barry Burnite, 
and Oscar Barker, Jr. Together, they 
fought valiantly to hold their position 
against the attacking Vietnamese. 
Their plight was unfortunately short- 
lived. Burnite was struck in the chest 
by shrapnel, and Johnson pulled him to 
a position of cover to save him. The 
two men fought until Burnite died and 
Johnson was killed. 
As the fighting continued, John was 
shot multiple times and sprayed with 
shrapnel. Barker tended to John’s 
wounds. The rest of the platoon had al-
ready been killed. John urged Barker 
to leave him and retreat, but Barker 
refused. Moments later, Barker was 
killed. 
Soon after, a napalm strike was 
dropped on John’s position, leaving 
him severely burned. Weak, but still 
alive, John managed to roll in the dirt 
and extinguish the flames that had en-
gulfed him, yet he continued his efforts 
to hold his position. 
That afternoon, John was surprised 
by enemy soldiers, shot in the face, and 
knocked unconscious. 
Despite the overwhelming odds and 
the horrific life-threatening wounds he 
had received, John refused to withdraw 
and continued exposing himself to the 
onslaught through the night, including 
throwing grenades with his remaining 
good arm. When dawn came, he was 
grievously 
wounded 
but 
remained 
alive. 
Three days later, he was discovered 
by a recovery unit and awarded the 
Purple Heart for his massive sacrifice 
for our Nation. I believe to my core 
John and several of the men in his pla-
toon have not been appropriately rec-
ognized for their valor. 
It is for this reason I and my col-
leagues have nominated him for the 
Distinguished Service Cross. 
John is now 78. He has lived with se-
vere injuries sustained in battle that 
impacted him throughout his life and 
are impacting him now. 
His reflections on life as a soldier and 
an American hero remain largely per-
sonal, but his valor endures. He is a 
soldier still, as he is now scaling an-
other battle related to his wartime 
service. 
He is handling this with such dignity, 
resolve, and even good humor. One can 
observe the raw courage that those of 
us who know him have witnessed 
through his life. 
John, what a truly great soldier you 
are in the military and in life. America 
salutes you for your unyielding valor 
and for your deep patriotism. 
No matter the challenge, you and 
your life are the very definition of 
courage. May God bless you and your 
fallen comrades, for surely you have 
blessed America. 
RECOGNIZING FLETC PEACE OFFI-
CERS 
MEMORIAL 
DAY 
CERE-
MONY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
Federal Law Enforcement Training 
Centers’ Peace Officers Memorial Day 
Ceremony. 
Each year, the Federal Law Enforce-
ment Training Centers engrave the 
names of graduates who made the ulti-
mate sacrifice in the line of duty dur-
ing the previous year. 
This ceremony commemorates an-
other year that has been distinguished 
by 
extraordinary 
law 
enforcement 
achievements but, unfortunately, has 
been marred by tragedy and personal 
loss. 
We must always remember those who 
have made the ultimate sacrifice while 
protecting and serving our community. 
Sadly, a total of 263 FLETC grad-
uates have paid the ultimate sacrifice 
since 1970. Tragically, we have had to 
add another 22 names for last year 
alone. 
Behind each and every one of these 
names there is a son, a daughter, a hus-
band, a mother, or a relative who 
misses their loved one. 
To all of our police officers and Fed-
eral law enforcement officials, thank 
you for your service to our commu-
nities and God bless you. 
I hope that my colleagues will take 
some time to thank these courageous 
individuals who work to keep us all 
safe. 
REMEMBERING AND HONORING ANN ERNST 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Ann 
Ernst of Savannah, Georgia, who sadly 
passed away on October 5 at the age of 
93. 
Ann attended Chatham County pub-
lic schools and Armstrong Junior Col-
lege and graduated from Valdosta 
State University with a degree in biol-
ogy. Following graduation, she worked 
at a research lab studying malaria 
transmission and control. 
Throughout her life, she was involved 
in teaching and inspiring the Savannah 
community. She served as curriculum 
director at Hancock Day School and 
taught children with learning disabil-
ities at the Royce Learning Center. 
Cherished by the Savannah commu-
nity for her contagious laughter and 
love of life, Ann’s immense impact was 
felt by everyone she knew. 
I am thankful for Ann’s lifetime of 
service, and I know her legacy will be 
forever treasured. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
her family, friends, and all who knew 
her during this most difficult time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5732 
October 21, 2021 
this week, I would like to recognize all 
pharmacists across the United States 
who ensure that Americans have access 
to important and often lifesaving medi-
cations. 
Every day pharmacists are directly 
involved in patient care, and phar-
macists 
are 
the 
most 
accessible 
healthcare professionals in the coun-
try. Ninety-five percent of Americans 
live within five miles of a pharmacy. 
From administering flu shots to 
COVID–19 vaccines, pharmacists are a 
vital resource in our communities, and 
they will continue to play an active 
role in combating the virus. Because of 
their hard work, lives will be saved. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage every-
one to get to know their pharmacists 
and to thank them for the work that 
they do. 
As a pharmacist currently serving in 
Congress, I thank all pharmacists 
around the world. We can look forward 
to a brighter future because of them. 
REMEMBERING AND HONORING DR. JAMES POLK 
‘‘JAY’’ BRINSON, III 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor former Wayne County super-
intendent, principal, and coach, Dr. 
Jay Brinson, who sadly passed away at 
the age of 51. 
Jay was proud to be a graduate of the 
Wayne County School System and was 
a devoted Yellow Jacket throughout 
his life. 
After graduating from Wayne County 
High School in 1988, he would return to 
the school for a 29-year career. During 
this time, he was a coach, a teacher, 
and an administrator with a personal 
mission to give back to a community 
that he believed invested so much in 
him. 
He 
retired 
as 
superintendent 
of 
Wayne County schools in March, leav-
ing a lasting impact on his students. 
Above all, Jay was a man of dignity 
who led by example. 
I am thankful for Jay’s service to 
Georgia’s First Congressional District, 
and I know his legacy will remain. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time.

CONGRATULATING CHIEF BRYAN 
REYES ON HIS RETIREMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the career of Palm 
Springs Police Chief Bryan Reyes, who 
retired after nearly 30 years of service 
to our communities. 
A veteran of the United States Ma-
rine Corps, Chief Reyes began his ca-
reer in law enforcement as a reserve 
police officer for the Compton Police 
Department in 1991. 
After 
transferring 
to 
the 
Palm 
Springs Police Department in 1993, he 
rose through the ranks, serving as an 
officer, detective, sergeant, lieutenant, 
and captain before ultimately becom-
ing police chief. 
Chief Reyes has had a lasting impact 
on the Palm Springs community and 
has led the department through dif-
ficult times. 
On October 8, 2016, during the first 
year of his tenure as chief of police, 
Palm Springs Police Officers Lesley 
Zerebny and Gilbert Vega were trag-
ically killed in the line of duty. 
Chief 
Reyes 
recognized 
the 
dev-
astating impact this would have on the 
department, community, and the offi-
cers’ families. In this difficult time, he 
prioritized the mental health needs of 
those 
affected, 
and 
his 
guidance 
brought us all closer together. 
I am honored to have collaborated 
with Chief Reyes in authoring legisla-
tion to commemorate the tremendous 
sacrifice made by Officers Zerebny and 
Vega that day. Named in their honor 
and inspired by our local police officers 
at the Palm Springs Police Depart-
ment, the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and 
Gilbert Vega First Responders Sur-
vivors Support Act would get families 
of our fallen heroes the support they 
need and ensure they have every oppor-
tunity to succeed in life. 
During his more than 6 years of lead-
ership, Chief Reyes strengthened the 
department’s community policing in 
neighborhoods and expanded engage-
ment with residents and community 
organizations. 
Further, he has received numerous 
accolades for his incredible leadership, 
including lifesaving medals, the officer 
of the year award, and the community 
heroes award. 
Chief Reyes’ 28 years of tireless and 
dedicated work for the Palm Springs 
community is a testament to his out-
standing leadership, character, and 
commitment to the well-being of Palm 
Springs residents. 
I have no doubt that changes brought 
about under his leadership will con-
tinue to improve the lives of Palm

Palm Springs community. 
On behalf of the great people of Cali-
fornia’s 36th Congressional District, 
thank you, Chief Bryan Reyes, for all 
you have done for our community. Con-
gratulations on your well-deserved re-

EXTRADITION OF ALEX SAAB 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. SALAZAR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, for 
those who enable murderous dictators, 
the United States system will find you 
in this life or the next, and this is the 
perfect example. 
For Alex Saab, the plunderer of Ven-
ezuela, justice for his crimes against 
humanity will be swift and without 
mercy. 
Why? Because over the weekend we 
learned that Saab will finally be extra-
dited to the United States. 
He tried to claim diplomatic immu-
nity, but he is not a diplomat. He is not 
a politician. He is just another thug for 
the Venezuelan regime. 
Saab was Maduro’s leading front man 
and his number one money launderer. 
He is a drug trafficker who is respon-
sible for flooding American streets 
with cocaine. He helped finance the 
worst crimes and the most appalling 
human rights abuses committed by the 
Maduro regime in Venezuela in the last 
15 years. 
So it is no surprise that Maduro, the 
dictator, has pulled out all the stops to 
try to prevent his extradition to the 
United States, but he could not. 
In the meantime, earlier this week, 
six American executives, American ex-
ecutives in Venezuela, known as the 
Citgo 6, were sent back to a cruel polit-
ical prison for no reason. 
The regime arrested these men on 
bogus charges in 2020 with no justifica-
tion. 
Now, 
with 
no 
explanation, 
Maduro has condemned these innocent 
American executives to rot in a Ven-
ezuelan prison. 
Why? Just one reason: retaliation be-
cause Maduro doesn’t like this picture. 
This is a classic tactic of tyrants. If 
Maduro thinks that he can make a 
prisoner exchange, he needs to wake up 
and realize that the United States does 
not deal with dictators. So the Citgo 6, 
six American executives, need to be re-
leased now, unconditionally. 
Unfortunately, Maduro right now is 
panicking because his top confidant 
will soon be facing trial in an Amer-
ican court of law, and he will say many 
things that Maduro doesn’t want us to 
hear. 
Today, the victims of the Maduro re-
gime in Venezuela will finally have 
some justice, but we, as a Nation, can-
not stop until Venezuela is free of this 
satanic nightmare called the Maduro 
regime.

RECOGNIZING LIBERTY 
UNIVERSITY’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 50th anniversary 
of Liberty University in Lynchburg, 
Virginia. 
Originally 
founded 
by 
Dr. 
Jerry 
Falwell, Sr. as Lynchburg Baptist Col-
lege in 1971, its first classes were held 
that September for its 154 students. 
Over the years, the college has grown 
and transformed in many ways, but has 
always remained a Christian academic 
community practicing the traditions of 
evangelical institutions of higher edu-
cation. 
The school was renamed Liberty Bap-
tist College in 1975 and became Liberty 
University in 1985. 
Now, Liberty University is one of the 
largest private nonprofit universities 
in the Nation and the largest univer-
sity in Virginia, boasting more than 
95,000 total undergraduate and post-
graduate students, both in person and 
online.

As of 2021, Liberty has more than 
250,000 alumni making an impact in 
their respective fields and in their

I congratulate Liberty University 
and president Jerry Prevo on this mile-
stone and wish the institution another 
50 years of success in fulfilling its mis-
sion to develop Christ-centered men 
and women and instill in them the val-
ues, knowledge, and skills needed to

PROTECTING CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHTS OF VETERANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, as rank-
ing member of the House Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs, one of my top prior-
ities is protecting the constitutional 
rights of our veterans. 
Today, I want to raise awareness of a 
policy that strips law-abiding veterans 
of their Second Amendment rights; 
specifically, the policy that requires 
VA to report veterans who need help 
managing their VA benefits to the 
NICS program, thereby making it ille-
gal for them to possess firearms. 
To illustrate this practice, I would 
like to tell you a story about a hypo-
thetical veteran named Joe. 
Joe likes to go on hunting trips with 
his fellow veterans. 
These trips are therapeutic for Joe. 
They give him stress relief and a fun 
hobby and an opportunity to connect 
with other veterans. 
Unfortunately, Joe begins to suffer 
from headaches and memory loss, 
which he believes is linked to an in- 
service blast injury. 
He files a claim for VA disability 
compensation benefits. 
During the claims process, the VA 
learns that Joe struggles to pay his 
bills on time because of this traumatic 
brain injury. 
This triggers the VA’s requirement 
to determine if Joe is capable of man-
aging his own VA benefits. 
Ultimately, VA decides that Joe re-
quires assistance handling his VA com-
pensation payments. 
The VA appoints a fiduciary to re-
ceive and manage Joe’s VA benefits on 
his behalf. 
As a result of the VA’s appointment 
of a fiduciary, VA must—not by law, 
but by administrative rule—report Joe 
to the FBI NICS list. 
And just like that, without evidence 
that Joe is a danger to himself or oth-
ers, without involving a judge to en-
sure that Joe’s legal rights are pro-
tected, without the opportunity for Joe 
to present his case in court on why he 
should be able to possess a firearm, Joe 
loses his Second Amendment rights. 
That means that Joe can no longer 
go on hunting trips with his friends or 
family. 
He can no longer own the hunting 
rifle his grandfather gave him. 
And when Joe’s friends learn about it 
and have learned what happened to 
him, they decide that they would rath-
er go without their VA benefits and 
services, instead of risking the same 
thing happening to them. 
That story may be fictional, but 
some version of it happens across this 
United States all the time. 
The truth is that some veterans fore-
go seeking VA services out of concern 
that they would lose their constitu-
tional rights; not because there are 
laws in place, but there is an adminis-
trative rule in place. 
According to the VA’s regulations, 
the purpose of the fiduciary program is 
to protect certain VA beneficiaries who 
cannot manage their VA benefits. 
Clearly, the program was never in-
tended to review someone’s right to 
own a firearm. 
A decision on a constitutional right 
should be left to a judicial authority, 
plain and simple. 
Now, my bill, H.R. 1217, the Veterans 
2nd Amendment Protection Act, would 
make sure that it is. 
H.R. 1217 would prevent VA from re-
porting veterans to the NICS list, un-
less there is an order from a judge or 
magistrate that says the veteran may 
be a harm to himself or herself or oth-
ers. 
This bill allows VA to focus on its 
mission of caring for veterans, and 
leaves decisions about whether to strip 
a veteran of their constitutional rights 
to the judicial branch as it is supposed 
to be and it is for any other person who 
is not a veteran. 
If a court finds that that veteran is a 
danger to themselves or others, then 
they should not be allowed to own a 
firearm. 
However, it is time we end this policy 
that the VA has put in place, and we 
should make sure that we change this, 
we correct this problem for veterans 
that are discouraged from seeking help 
from the VA because of this rule. 
We must make this change. If you 
want to ensure that veterans who need 
VA are willing to walk through VA’s 
doors, that is how we do it. We make 
sure that they know their rights are 
protected. 
I urge swift passage of H.R. 1217.

WASTEFUL 
SPENDING 
IS 
NOT 
WHAT 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
ECONOMY NEEDS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, Demo-
crats are determined to pass their mas-
sive socialist tax and spending bill that 
will turn the American Dream into a 
socialist nightmare. 
Democrats are proposing the largest 
tax increase in most of our lifetimes. 
Their $5.5 trillion plan—Senator BER-
NIE SANDERS’ socialist spending plan— 
is the largest spending bill in our his-
tory and will take Americans out of 
the frying pan and into the fire. 
We need targeted infrastructure im-
provements, but instead, this style of 
cradle-to-grave Big Government gives 
Washington bureaucrats control over 
our personal and family decisions. 
This 
spending 
bill 
promises 
to 
stretch the social safety net to every 
American household regardless of need. 
It promises extreme climate change 
proposals like $3 billion for tree equity 
and $12 billion for electric cars. 
It promises subsidized government 
daycare, taxpayer-funded free college 
classes for illegal immigrants, uni-
versal pre-K, and new funding for gen-
der identity issues and bias training. 
The Biden administration is actively 
trying to gaslight the American people 
by claiming that this spending package 
will cost nothing. 
Just this morning I heard the Presi-
dent emphasizing a single statement 
three times that the cost of this plan 
would be zero. This is an outright lie. 
It will be America’s middle-class 
families that foot the bill for Demo-
crats’ 
multitrillion-dollar 
giveaway 
through crippling tax increases. This 
massive package will not deliver oppor-
tunity or economic relief, instead it 
leaves rural America behind and will 
accelerate inflation, discourage work, 
and empower Washington bureaucrats. 
More wasteful spending is not what 
our economy needs. It has already con-
tributed to the harmful inflation that 
Americans across the board are experi-
encing. Today, inflation is more than 5 
percent, the highest it has been in 30 
years, more than half of my lifetime 
and more than the lifetimes of many 
Americans. Wholesale prices have risen 
at the fastest pace on record. 
Americans do not want a government 
that defines them. Rather, Americans 
want to be able to define their own 
government. 
We can meet our country’s funding 
needs without jeopardizing our eco-
nomic recovery and saddling future 
generations with more debt. 
I ran for Congress because I am wor-
ried about the country that we are 
going to leave to my sons, Guy and 
Sam, and to the children and grand-
children and great-grandchildren of 
every American. I cannot in good con-
science support a proposal that will 
mortgage their future, that will im-
peril their freedom and liberty. 
But Democrats are bent on spending 
massively to enact their radical far- 
left socialist policies that will change 
our economy, change our Nation, and 
change our fiscal future for the worse. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY IS

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today because our economy is in 
trouble. We are headed in the wrong di-
rection. We must reverse course.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5734 
October 21, 2021 
My constituents are paying more 
today than they were a year ago for 
basic goods like milk, gas, and bread. 
In fact, the national average price for 
a gallon of gas recently reached $3.36, 
more than $1 higher than it was a year 
ago and the highest price since October 
of 2014. 
It was also recently announced that 
core inflation is at a 30-year high. 
Inflation has gone up every month 
since President Biden has been in of-
fice. 
Inflation is an invisible tax on all 
Americans, and it especially hurts sen-
iors living on a fixed income. 
Out-of-control government spending 
fuels inflation. 
Some of my colleagues seem to be-
lieve more spending is the answer. 
They have proposed a $4.3 trillion 
spending plan coupled with a $1.5 tril-
lion infrastructure package, both of 
which are filled with pork, unfortu-
nately. 
For example, the spending bill con-
tains billions for job training in cli-
mate careers to create a Civilian Cli-
mate Corps to promote the Green New 
Deal; to develop environmental justice 
initiatives; for housing grants to felons 
convicted of domestic violence or hate 
crimes; to benefit, again, 10 million il-
legal immigrants; and $200 million for a 
park in San Francisco. 
While I do believe we need to invest 
in traditional infrastructures such as 
roads, bridges, internet connectivity, 
and cybersecurity, only a very small 
percentage of the proposed infrastruc-
ture package funds these types of es-
sential projects, which is wrong. We 
must spend more on traditional infra-
structure and get rid of the perks. 
These spending packages would raise 
taxes on every American, not just the 
rich. 
They will kill American jobs and 
make us less competitive in the global 
marketplace. 
In the end, it is more frivolous Wash-
ington spending, which is the absolute 
wrong approach, in my opinion, to fix-
ing our economic woes. 
It will only make matters worse, 
Madam Speaker. 
Small business owners, who are the 
backbone of our economy, are having a 
very difficult time recovering from the 
pandemic, as you know. Not only are 
they dealing with the same infla-
tionary pressures that all Americans 
are experiencing, but they are also fac-
ing labor and material shortages. 
As we head into the holiday season, 
consumer demand will only continue to 
rise. 
The supply chain bottlenecks must 
be resolved immediately to prevent 
further damage to our economy. 
Instead of working together to find 
common ground and areas about which 
we can build consensus—that is how we 
govern—my colleagues on the left, 
though, seem determined to go it 
alone. That is the wrong approach, 
Madam Speaker. 
They have spent weeks publicly argu-
ing amongst themselves about how 
many trillions of American taxpayer 
dollars they should spend without any 
concern to what this out-of-control 
spending will do to our already strug-
gling economy. 
Simply put, this is not how we grow 
the economy. This is how we grow in-
flation. 
In order to restore our way of life and 
renew the American Dream, we must 
implement Trump-era economic poli-
cies that yielded unprecedented eco-
nomic growth, the lowest unemploy-
ment levels for minorities in the his-
tory of the United States, energy inde-
pendence—that is what we need—and 
the highest rise in middle-class wages 
in decades. 
The destructive economic policies of 
those on the left must be defeated.

HONORING COACH DOUG SMITH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the leadership and 
perseverance of Appomattox County 
High School coach, Doug Smith. 
Doug Smith has led the Appomattox 
Raiders football team since 2012. Under 
his leadership, the team has boasted a 
32-game winning streak, and won State 
championship titles in 2015, 2016, and 
2017. While Coach Smith’s record is 
amazing, his leadership extends well 
beyond the field. 
Coach Smith has truly united the 
community behind their team, as evi-
denced by the large groups on Friday 
nights. One cannot visit Appomattox 
County without seeing the impact 
Coach Smith has made on his students, 
his coworkers, and the community at 
large. 
Modeling by example, he has taught 
his student athletes to be productive 
citizens, such as when the team fa-
mously came out in full force to help 
those affected by the devastating tor-
nado that hit Appomattox in 2016. 
However, Coach Smith is best known 
for his relationship with Jesus Christ, 
his eternal perspective, and his focus 
on those things that matter more than 
football. This has been most clearly 
displayed since the fall of 2020, as 
Coach Smith has faced a great personal 
challenge of his own with a diagnosis of 
multiple myeloma, a cancer of the 
plasma cells. 
He has been a tremendous testimony 
through this journey. Thankfully, it 
appears that the Lord has him on the 
road to recovery. My continued prayers 
are with Coach Smith as he continues 
to fight this terrible disease. 
I thank Coach Smith for his commit-
ment to service and leadership. Coach 
Smith is an inspiration to us all about 
the importance of serving others, even 
through personal challenges. 
COMMEMORATING SAILORS AND MARINES 
ABOARD USS ‘‘FORRESTAL’’ ON JULY 29, 1967 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to remember and express grat-
itude to the brave sailors and marines 
who were wounded or lost their lives 
fighting the catastrophic fire aboard 
the ship, the USS Forrestal. 
July 29, 2021, marked the 54th anni-
versary of one of the most tragic fires 
in U.S. naval history. On July 29, 1967, 
the USS Forrestal, which was sup-
porting combat operations off the coast 
of Vietnam, was impacted by an acci-
dental rocket that ignited a fire and 
triggered several bomb explosions on 
the flight deck. 
Sailors and marines on board, includ-
ing several Virginians, bravely fought 
the fire for 18 hours. Despite the coura-
geous efforts of the crew, 134 men died, 
161 were wounded, and 21 aircraft were 
destroyed. Sadly, veterans wounded 
that day are still fighting their claims 
with the VA, such as my constituent, 
Mr. David Cephas Smith, of Vinton, 
Virginia. These heroes were not award-
ed the Purple Heart because their 
wounds did not occur during enemy 
combat, but their bravery still merits 
recognition. 
We are forever grateful for the serv-
ice of veterans, like Mr. Smith, who 
were wounded or sacrificed their lives 
battling this fire aboard the USS For-
restal.

PROTECTING THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, in my home State of Pennsyl-
vania, a woman was brutally raped by 
an illegal immigrant. 
In Congress, one of our primary du-
ties is to protect the American people. 
By allowing illegal immigrants who 
have committed crimes to remain 
within our borders signifies that we are 
failing. Allowing an illegal immigrant 
who has committed acts of sexual vio-
lence to remain in our country shows 
that we are failing. 
Congress must move immediately to 
pass legislation ensuring that any im-
migrant who commits acts of violence 
is deported. What happened in Phila-
delphia this week was a failure of 
American leadership. It showed clearly 
that the Biden crime crisis is esca-
lating. 
Now, as apprehensions at our south-
ern border hit record highs, President 
Biden is taking away the vital re-
sources that our Border Patrol agents 
need to do their job. The answer to 
stopping our border crisis and our 
crime crisis is not to defund the police. 
The answer is not to be more lenient 
on illegal immigrants who have com-
mitted violent crimes against Ameri-
cans. 
We must put the safety of the Amer-
ican citizens first, and we must put the 
security of the American citizens first.

CELEBRATING 
CLARKE 
COMMU-
NITY HIGH SCHOOL INDIANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
recent success of a high school football 
team in Iowa’s Second District. For the 
first time in 31 years, the Clarke Com-
munity High School Indians are headed 
to the playoffs. The team finished the 
regular season with a 5-and-3 record, 
which is also a first in 31 years. 
Although their season had plenty of 
ups and downs, the team persevered 
and worked hard to make their com-
munity proud. They will be traveling 
up to Williamsburg, Iowa, tomorrow, 
October 22, to take on the Raiders in 
the first round of the playoffs. I am 
confident that Clarke will make the 
Second District proud. 
Congratulations to Coach Quinlan 
and his staff, and all the players, and 
the entire Clarke County community 
on their success, and good luck tomor-
row night. 
SAVE OUR SERVICEMEMBERS 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to discuss an 
issue that has become a national crisis 
and that must be immediately ad-
dressed. Serving in the Army for 24 
years as both a nurse and a physician, 
from the Vietnam era to the first Gulf 
War, I have seen many of my fellow 
veterans suffer from anxiety, depres-
sion, survivor’s guilt, and PTSD. Many 
veterans are still living with those 
scars, and without proper care and 
treatment, mental health crises can 
make everyday life a struggle or even 
life-threatening for them or their fami-
lies. 
Yesterday, I partnered with my fel-
low 
veterans, 
Congressman 
RUBEN 
GALLEGO, a corporal in the Marine 
Corps, Senator JONI ERNST, a fellow 
veteran and a fellow Army lieutenant 
colonel, and Senator MARK KELLY, a 
captain in the Navy, to introduce the 
Save Our Servicemembers Act. 
This bipartisan and bicameral legis-
lation would direct the Pentagon to 
evaluate the effectiveness of their sui-
cide prevention efforts and to improve 
its data collection, reduce bureaucratic 
duplication, and strengthen collabora-
tion between its offices. 
I am heartbroken at the continued 
rise in suicides in the veteran commu-
nity and our military communities. It 
is no secret that our servicemembers 
often face invisible challenges when 
they return to civilian life, and we 
need to do a better job addressing their 
needs and the needs of their families. 
We need to look into all of our men-
tal health and suicide prevention pro-
grams to better service our heroes, and 
I am proud to partner with an incred-
ible group of veterans in Congress on 
this legislation. 
To our servicemembers and our vet-
erans, I want you to know that you are 
not alone and there are people who 
care and are trained to help you in any 
mental health crisis you might face. 
I encourage everyone to check in on 
your family and your friends because 
sometimes the deepest wounds are the 
ones that we cannot see. 
MOURNING THE LOSS OF STATE TROOPER TED 
BENDA 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
tragic loss of one of Iowa’s heroes. 
Yesterday, October 20, Iowa State 
Trooper Ted Benda passed away from 
injuries sustained during a crash while 
responding to a call for help to detain 
a wanted suspect in Clayton County. 
Over his 16-year public safety career, 
Trooper Benda served with honor and 
courage each and every day. Trooper 
Benda began his public safety career 
with the Iowa Division of Criminal In-
vestigation in 2005. He later moved to 
the Special Enforcement Operations 
Bureau, and finally, to the Iowa State 
Patrol, admirably serving communities 
in Northeast Iowa. 
It is days like this when we are re-
minded of the sacrifices so many of our 
law enforcement officers make every 
day. I am proud to say that I was al-
ways ready to support them and do 
whatever I could in Congress to ensure 
that they are properly funded, trained, 
and equipped. Trooper Benda was a 
hero, not just in his community, but to 
all of Iowa. His years of dedication and 
service will never be forgotten. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
Trooper Benda’s wife, Holly, their four 
young children, all of his loved ones, 
and the entire Iowa State Patrol fam-
ily.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF DICK GRIFFIN 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to honor the life and 
legacy of Dick Griffin, a towering fig-
ure in Buffalo’s legal community and 
one of our leading citizens. 
Dick worked to make Buffalo a more 
just place as a champion of the civil 
rights movement in the courtroom and 
as a trusted adviser to national and 
local civil rights leaders. 
An attorney for 64 years, he was ad-
mired and respected widely for his tal-
ent, capability, and legal mind, so 
much so that later in his career, he was 
called upon to arbitrate some of the 
toughest regional legal issues, includ-
ing that of compensation for the vic-
tims of the tragedy of Flight 3407. 
He cared deeply about his community 
and played an active role in civic and 
philanthropic efforts to improve parks, 
public spaces, and whole neighbor-
hoods. 
We mourn the loss of Dick Griffin 
today and extend our condolences to 
his wife and my friend, Dr. Jane Grif-
fin, and their children Mary, Anne, 
Thomas, and Richard.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5736 
October 21, 2021 
HOLDING PRESIDENT BIDEN 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR RISING PRICES 
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address a crisis hurting every 
household in America: skyrocketing 
prices. 
If you listen to the Biden administra-
tion, they will tell you that this is a 
‘‘high-class problem.’’ This is a lie 
propagated by those who have never 
had to do the mental math at the gro-
cery store to make sure the amount in 
their cart does not exceed the cash in 
their wallet. 
For Democrat leaders, paying 42 per-
cent more at the pump isn’t a problem. 
I suppose the price of gas isn’t a con-
cern if you are riding government-fund-
ed high-speed rail in Silicon Valley. 
More than 90 percent of my constitu-
ents reported that rising prices are im-
pacting their household budgets. Infla-
tion is destroying Americans’ ability 
to save for retirement, buy a home, or 
build wealth. This isn’t a tax on the 
rich. It is an enormous burden for 
working Americans. 
It is not too late to change course. I 
have introduced legislation to increase 
the transparency in government spend-
ing so that lawmakers will be forced to 
answer for reckless spending sprees. 
Moreover, my Retirement Inflation 
Protection Act will protect Americans 
from inflation-driven tax burdens right 
when they enter retirement. 
This crisis is already hitting home 
for millions of Americans. We must act 
before it financially cripples genera-
tions of Americans to come. 
f 
WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED, AMERICA 
SUCCEEDS 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, we all 
know that we do not have economic 
policies that set women up for success. 
The pandemic has put a cruel spot-
light on these challenges. In fact, one 
out of four women has been pushed out 
of the workforce because the care econ-
omy collapsed. 
We have a once-in-a-generation op-
portunity to change this paradigm, 
while supporting a tenuous economic 
recovery, by making transformative in-
vestments 
in 
America’s 
working 
women. 
The Build Back Better agenda in-
vests in childcare, paid family leave, 
home-based care, universal pre-K, and 
the child tax credit. 
There is no doubt that the Build 
Back Better agenda sets up women and 
their families for short-term and long- 
term success. 
And we all know that when women 
and their families succeed, America 
succeeds. 
STAND UP FOR SCIENCE 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, this 
month 
the 
current 
administration 
made the reckless and undeniably par-
tisan decision to begin reconsultation 
of the 2019 biological opinions. 
In its place, the proposed interim op-
erations plan represents a huge step 
backward in California’s effort to pro-
tect, restore, and enhance the delta 
ecosystem and provide reliable water 
supplies. 
The 2019 BiOps were built on years of 
research, comprehensive peer reviews, 
and the best available science. They 
advise the most efficient use of water 
resources while continuing to protect 
at-risk species. 
These BiOps also allow for greater 
water availability for the Central Val-
ley farmers that feed the world. Ques-
tioning 
these 
expert 
findings 
is 
antiscience. 
I led the entire Republican California 
delegation in expressing our grave con-
cern to the Secretaries of the Interior 
and Commerce. 
As the California drought worsens, 
communities in my district face water 
shortages and farmers are unable to 
maintain their crops. 
I implore my colleagues and this ad-
ministration to stand up for these suf-
fering families and farmers, stand up 
for science, and reject this outrageous 
decision. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
NATIONAL 
DOMES-
TIC 
VIOLENCE 
AWARENESS 
MONTH 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize National Domestic Vio-
lence Awareness Month. 
Sadly, domestic violence has plagued 
our families and communities in the 
Nation for far too long. 
Each year, one in three women and 
one in four men in the United States 
experience domestic violence. 
My hometown of Fresno has, sadly, 
one of the highest rates in California of 
verified domestic violence calls to the 
police department. 
We cannot ignore these staggering 
statistics, and we must do more to ad-
dress this crisis. This year, Congress 
passed the Violence Against Women 
Act and the Victims of Crime Act, or 
VOCA, fix, to prevent violence and ex-
pand victim services to our commu-
nities. 
These bills would help organizations 
working tirelessly to uplift survivors, 
including the Marjaree Mason Center, 
the Centro La Familia, and the Valley 
Crisis Center in my district. 
This week, the House also will be 
voting on the Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Improvement Act of 
2021, of which I am a cosponsor. This 
bill aims to improve services for vic-
tims of domestic, dating, and family 
violence, and we need to invest more. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
advancing these efforts to end domestic 
violence. As chair and cofounder of the 
Congressional Crime Survivors and 
Justice Caucus, it ought to be our pri-
ority to benefit those survivors and 
provide them the resources they de-
serve. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TOM 
CAVANAGH 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
honor 
the 
life 
of 
Tom 
Cavanagh of Springfield, Illinois, who 
passed away this past weekend. 
Tom had decades-long service to 
Springfield and to Sangamon County. 
Tom was known as a loyal friend and a 
consistent advocate for taxpayers. Tom 
spent three decades in public service, 
serving four terms as Sangamon Coun-
ty treasurer and also county auditor, 
as Capital Township supervisor of as-
sessments, and on the Springfield Park 
District board of trustees. 
Tom’s years of dedicated service in 
support of Springfield and Sangamon 
County culminated in his recognition 
as the Illinois County Official of the 
Year in 2018, when he was serving as 
treasurer. 
Everyone who had the pleasure of 
knowing Tom knew him for his great 
sense of humor and commitment to the 
community he served. Tom always had 
a knack for finding a way to provide 
better services at a lower cost for San-
gamon and Springfield residents. 
Tom will be missed by our Spring-
field community, but his legacy will 
carry on through the work he did to 
better Sangamon County. 
As 
central 
Illinois 
continues 
to 
mourn Tom’s loss, my thoughts and 
prayers remain with his family and 
loved ones. 
f 
FORD IS COMING TO WEST 
TENNESSEE 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
COHEN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Ford 
Motor Company recently announced it 
is going to place a facility to construct 
electric 
trucks 
at 
the 
Memphis 
megasite in west Tennessee. This site 
is 50 miles from Memphis and has been 
developed for the purpose of industrial 
opportunities for people in west Ten-
nessee who need it well, and it affects 
Memphis. 
We are happy and proud that Ford 
picked this site for these jobs and for 
this important environmental effort to 
have electric batteries for vehicles and 
electric trucks. We think Ford will be 
a great representative in Memphis. 
They have been a good representative 
in Louisville.

f 
RACE TO GREEN IS TAX ON 
WORKING FAMILIES 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
the cost of everything is spiking, from 
gas to groceries. 
One of the main reasons for these 
spikes is that energy costs are soaring. 
Affordable, reliable energy fuels our 
economy and our daily lives. 
But some of my colleagues don’t like 
the affordable, reliable energy that has 
built our economy and lifted billions of 
men, women, and children around the 
world out of poverty. Why? Because 
this energy has been provided by fossil 
fuels and nuclear power, energy sources 
vilified by many wealthy elites and the 
activist class, those least impacted by 
these high prices. 
Make no mistake, when pipelines are 
blocked, new leasing on Federal lands 
is stopped, and mines are forced to 
close, working families pay the price. 
This rush to green is a tax on work-
ing families, the middle class, because 
a larger part of their paychecks is con-
sumed by these increasing prices on 
items necessary for daily life. 
The American people should know, 
this race to green is not really about 
carbon. It is about control. 
f 
GOD BLESS U.S. BORDER PATROL 
(Ms. HERRELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, today I 
am proud to rise in support of the 
brave men and women of the U.S. Bor-
der Patrol. I believe our agents need to 
know how grateful we are for their 
service to the United States of Amer-
ica. 
No doubt they have rewarding ca-
reers, but these days it has become a 
thankless job. Sadly, the media often 
ignores the role our agents play in hu-
manitarian efforts along our borders. 
They save lives and rescue women and 
children who are being trafficked and 
abused. 
U.S. Border Patrol agents are some 
of the most amazing people I have ever 
met. Every day they risk their lives 
during confrontations with cartels, 
coyotes, drug runners, and criminal 
gangs, all to keep you and me and the 
sovereignty of our Nation safe. 
It is time we stand in support of 
these fine men and women, encourage 
them with prayer, and support them 
with policies and procedures they need 
to keep America safe. 
God bless each one of our U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Patrol agents.

RECOGNIZING LEVI LINDEMUTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
very special individual from Brockway, 
Pennsylvania, Levi Lindemuth. 
Earlier this year, Levi was watching 
‘‘Home Alone 2’’ when he was inspired 
to do something to help children who 
are in the hospital. Combining his love 
of gardening and passion to help oth-
ers, Levi started Levi’s Hope Blossoms. 
Levi started selling flowers in his 
hand-painted pots and cans for a $5 do-
nation. All the proceeds from Hope 
Blossoms go to St. Jude hospitals, and 
so far Levi has made over 100 hope blos-
soms, raising nearly $1,000. 
Levi’s efforts to help St. Jude’s stem 
from a serious complication that re-
quired surgery when he was 5 days old. 
Now a happy and healthy 7-year-old 
boy, Levi is committed to giving back 
to children who were once in his posi-
tion. 
Levi sells these colorful planters and 
can take personal design requests via 
his Facebook page, Levi’s Hope Blos-
soms. 
When asked why he started Hope 
Blossoms, Levi’s answer was simple: ‘‘I 
don’t think kids should have to pay to 
be healthy.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, Levi is an inspiration to 
all of us. 
f 
AMERICANS SHOULD NOT EXPECT 
LESS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, James Freeman of the Wall 
Street Journal on October 19 wrote an 
editorial on how Americans should not 
be complacent living with less, as jobs 
are destroyed while inflation acceler-
ates: 
‘‘Selling the Joe Biden-Bernie Sand-
ers era of scarcity won’t be easy. And 
it’s going to get much harder if the 
President and his legislative coauthor 
enact their massive new plan to dis-
courage productive labor. 
Examining the House version of the plan, 
economist Casey Mulligan estimates that by 
reducing the incentives to work, the bill’s 
planned expansions of Federal benefits will 
cost nine million jobs. 
Already, the COVID-era combination of as-
tronomical government spending and money 
creation has resulted in too many dollars 
chasing too few goods. 
Generations of them, American consumers, 
built the largest economy in the world and 
various online commenters have suggested a 
slogan for Democrats running in 2022: Expect 
Less. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from Afghanistan to 
America. 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
OF THE TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN 
SOLDIER 
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
will introduce legislation, along with 
100 other Members, to recognize the 
centennial anniversary of the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier in Arlington 
Cemetery. 
This Sunday, October 24, 2021, marks 
the 100-year anniversary since the body 
of one unidentified member of the 
Armed Forces who died during World 
War I was selected as the first Un-
known Soldier. 
Since that date, an unidentified 
member of the Armed Forces from 
World War II, the Korean war, and the 
Vietnam war have been interred into 
the tomb. 
This resolution recognizes the ulti-
mate sacrifice of the unknown soldiers 
interred at Arlington Cemetery and 
shows our gratitude and appreciation 
for all the members of the Armed 
Forces. 
Since the creation of the Tomb of the 
Unknown Soldier, members of the 3rd 
U.S. Infantry Regiment, known as 
‘‘The Old Guard,’’ have protected this 
sacred site 24 hours a day, 365 days a 
year. 
100 years after the burial of the Un-
known Soldier from World War I, the 
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier con-
tinues to be a powerful symbol of serv-
ice and sacrifice, mourning, and mem-
ory. 
I am proud to introduce a resolution 
that pays respect to our Armed Forces 
and honors the 100-year anniversary of 
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

HONORING DONALD SNYDER 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given

Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, in the 
words of Saint Teresa, ‘‘Death is noth-
ing else but going home to God, the 
bond of love will be unbroken for all 
eternity.’’ 
I rise today with great honor to rec-
ognize the extraordinary life of Attor-
ney Donald Snyder of West Winfield, 
New York, who passed away last 
month. 
Don was a gem of a man and a won-
derful servant to our community. Don 
was also admired by his peers. 
I remember Don being a very close 
friend of my father, the late Honorable 
Justice John R. Tenney, who always 
spoke so highly of Don as a person to 
model your career and your gift of 
service on. 
Don served our Nation in the Army, 
and he returned home to start a coun-
try law practice in little West Winfield, 
New York, in Herkimer County. 
Don was a wonderful servant who 
served on the board of Herkimer Col-
lege for over 22 years and the chair for 
12.

Don was involved with so many orga-
nizations and schools and church orga-
nizations, but he was also a very dedi-
cated husband to his wife, Mary The-
resa Higgins, and a dedicated father of 
four and grandfather of 12. 
Nine people in Don’s family are at-
torneys. They were all sworn in on the 
very same day by the U.S. Supreme 
Court, which made the front page news 
in our little town. Don was very proud 
of this. 
Don was a man who devoted his life 
to 
service, 
to 
happiness, 
and 
he 
couldn’t have been a kinder person to 
me and a better friend and mentor for 
me as an attorney when I first started 
out many years ago. 
I can’t express enough my deepest 
condolences to his family, his friends, 
and our community. This is truly the 
loss of a great man. I wish them all the 
best, and it was an honor to call Don 
Snyder my friend.

RECOGNIZING THE ASSISTANCE TO 
FIREFIGHTERS 
GRANTS 
PRO-
GRAM ON ITS 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
(Mr. MCHENRY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, it is 
often said that there are inefficiencies 
and waste in the Federal Government. 
Well, I am here to recognize the most 
efficient grant writing program in the 
Federal Government: The Assistance to 
Firefighters Grant Program, marking 
its 20th anniversary. 
The AFG program, along with its sis-
ter programs SAFER and Fire Preven-
tion Grants, help deliver training, 
manpower, 
and 
desperately 
needed 
equipment straight to where they are 
most 
needed. 
Communities 
across 
America have benefited from these pro-
grams over the past 20 years; all of this 
with hardly any overhead costs. 
It is a well-run program. Why? Well, 
because it is largely run by the fire 
service. 
Throughout my time in Congress, it 
has been a true honor to have visited 
well over 100 fire departments in my 
district. These are some of my favorite 
visits. And you see the best of America 
in these everyday heroes. 
On a final note, I thank Chief Jeff 
Cash, Jason Wofford, and Ryan Cole for 
teaching 
my 
AFG 
grant 
classes 
throughout the years. 
I would encourage my colleagues to 
do likewise to ensure their fire services 
are well taken care of with the best 
training and equipment they deserve. 
Thank you to the AFG program and 
to the fire service.

RELATING 
TO 
THE 
CONSIDER-
ATION OF HOUSE REPORT 117–152 
AND AN ACCOMPANYING RESO-
LUTION 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 727 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 727 
Resolved, That if House Report 117–152 is 
called up by direction of the Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th At-
tack on the United States Capitol: (a) all 
points of order against the report are waived 
and the report shall be considered as read; 
and (b)(1) an accompanying resolution of-
fered by direction of the Select Committee 
to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
United States Capitol shall be considered as 
read and shall not be subject to a point of 
order; and (2) the previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on such resolution to 
adoption without intervening motion or de-
mand for division of the question except one 
hour of debate equally divided among and 
controlled by Representative Thompson of 
Mississippi, Representative Cheney of Wyo-
ming, and an opponent, or their respective 
designees. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, yes-
terday the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 727. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
the resolution accompanying House 
Report 117–152 under a closed rule if the 
report is called up by direction of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol. It provides 1 hour of de-
bate equally divided among and con-
trolled by Chair THOMPSON, Vice Chair 
CHENEY, and an opponent. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we face a funda-
mental choice: Whether we are going to 
get to the truth about the violent Jan-
uary 6 attack, the worst assault on the 
Capitol since the War of 1812 and the 
worst domestic assault on American 
democracy since the Civil War, or 
whether we are going to allow lawful 
subpoenas to be ignored and the inves-
tigation being conducted by the select 
committee to be obstructed to puff up 
the ego of the former President, who 
has launched another frivolous lawsuit, 
this time against the select committee. 
I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I still 
remember January 6 like it was yester-
day. I was standing right where you are 
now, Mr. Speaker. Our democracy was 
in peril; the lives of Members of Con-
gress, our staffs, and all the workers 
here were endangered. And Capitol Po-
lice officers were beaten or worse. 
Getting to the truth of what hap-
pened or placating the ego of a former 
President, that shouldn’t be a tough 
call. In any ordinary time, it wouldn’t 
be. This measure would probably have 
passed on suspension. 
Because as a Member of Congress, we 
have fewer more important and solemn 
duties than what is at the heart of the 
measure before us today, and that is 
protecting our democracy and pre-
venting future attempts to overturn 
the results of an election. 
This is about country, not about 
party. 
Now, many witnesses are already 
doing their patriotic duty and cooper-
ating voluntarily with the select com-
mittee. 
In fact, 10 of the 11 witnesses re-
quired to produce records to the select 
committee by the required deadline are 
engaging with the committee. 
Only one person, Mr. Speaker, is re-
fusing. One. Stephen K. Bannon. 
Instead of doing the right thing, the 
legal thing, the patriotic thing, Mr. 
Bannon is hiding behind the former 
President’s false claims of executive 
privilege to try to run out the clock on 
this investigation. 
Now, maybe he has something to 
hide. I don’t know. But the law isn’t on 
his side. It is not on Donald Trump’s 
side either. 
Executive privilege is not absolute, 
and President Biden has declined to in-
voke that privilege. 
There is a long history of the White 
House making accommodations to in-
vestigative requests from Congress. 
That is especially true when the public 
interest outweighs other interests, as 
it does here. 
But apparently facts and the law 
don’t matter to some. Apparently, 
Steve Bannon thinks he is above the 
law. Maybe it is because he was par-
doned by the former occupant of the 
White House. 
But ultimately, in the United States 
of America, no one should be above the 
law.

idea. But we live in an age where ap-
parently some put fidelity to Donald 
Trump over fidelity to the Constitu-
tion. And I find that disgusting. 
I get it. The former President is in 
Mar-a-Lago somewhere seething about 
our efforts to get to the truth about 
January 6. 
But is he so feared, Mr. Speaker, that 
my Republican colleagues are going to 
keep denying what happened that day? 
And keep trying to sweep it under the 
rug as if it never happened? Oh, it was 
no big deal. 
This is our democracy that we are 
talking about here. This is about the 
oath we took and the freedoms we 
cherish, freedoms that Americans have 
fought and died for, Mr. Speaker. 
And some on the other side, are they 
really willing to throw away all of that 
to placate the whims of one man? Real-
ly? 
This has to stop. 
The legal scholar James Landis once 
said: ‘‘To deny Congress power to ac-
quaint itself with facts is equivalent to 
requiring it to prescribe remedies in 
darkness.’’ 
We need to see the facts in the cold 
light of day and follow them wherever 
they lead. 
That means not only holding those 
who attack this building itself ac-
countable, as the legal system is cur-
rently doing, it also means holding 
people accountable when they attack 
what this building stands for: Democ-
racy and rule of law. 
b 1230 
We will not tolerate being left in the 
dark, and certainly not when some-
thing so fundamental is at stake. 
Now, this doesn’t have to be a par-
tisan fight. And just yesterday in the 
Committee on Rules, we debated the 
underlying measure at length. And, 
yes, we heard from the usual Members 
who rushed to the former President’s 
defense, who deflected and wanted to 
talk about anything other than the 
events of January 6. But we also saw 
something more remarkable. 
Chairman THOMPSON, a Democrat, sat 
side-by-side with Vice Chair CHENEY, a 
Republican, two people who probably 
have never voted for the same Presi-
dential candidates in their lives; two 
people who disagree on virtually every 
issue. But they agreed on this: On de-
fending the Constitution and rule of 
law. Let’s follow their example. 
Mr. Speaker, I sat across the dais 
from Congresswoman CHENEY for years 
on the Committee on Rules when the 
Republicans were in charge. We were 
polar 
opposites. 
But 
yesterday, 
I 
couldn’t have agreed with her more, 
not as a Democrat but as an American. 
Now I don’t give a damn if you are a 
Democrat or a Republican, and I don’t 
care if you like Donald Trump or not. 
Matters like this are about something 
more than petty partisanship. 
So I urge my colleagues, let’s put our 
country before our party. Let’s put de-
fending our democracy before defend-
ing Donald Trump. Let’s support this 
rule and the underlying measure, not 
as Democrats or Republicans, but as 
public servants, as Members of Con-
gress dedicated to preserving American 
democracy and the rule of law. That is 
what is at stake here and nothing less. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I thank the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, it is hard to ignore the 
feeling that this is one more example 
of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle trying to distract from the 
real issues that concern Americans. We 
have an administration that can’t stop 
the flood of illegal immigrants at our 
southern border, can’t unlock the sup-
ply bottlenecks at our ports. 
What are the Democrats doing about 
inflation? 
What are the Democrats doing about 
the border issues? 
What are the Democrats doing about 
supply chain issues? 
And what are the Democrats doing 
about the worker shortage? 
And I could go on. Instead, we are 
here going back and forth arguing if we 
should continue down a path of yet an-
other partisan investigation of ques-
tionable motives and purpose. No won-
der the public thinks we can’t do our 
job. 
That said, there are several questions 
that need to be resolved before we can 
continue with this vote. The Supreme 
Court has found that the power rests 
with Congress for subpoenas if they 
serve a legitimate legislative purpose, 
and be ‘‘related to, and in furtherance 
of, a legitimate task of the Congress.’’ 
A 
legitimate 
legislative 
purpose 
would be issuing subpoenas to the lead-
ers of the D.C. National Guard and Ser-
geant at Arms so that we can find out 
what gaps in communications and au-
thorities that need to be filled and find 
solutions to ensure that this doesn’t 
happen again. But have those been 
issued? No. 
Instead, House Democrats are con-
tinuing their witch hunt into President 
Trump and their political opponents 
that voted against the certification of 
the election in some States, something 
that they, themselves, did just 4 years 
ago. 
What information is intended to be 
gathered that would be useful for a le-
gitimate legislative purpose? Much of 
the discussion in the Rules Committee 
centered around criminal action, not 
around 
legislation. 
These 
concerns 
would have been raised by Republicans 
if Speaker PELOSI had not rejected the 
minority leader’s nominees. But in-
stead, she hand-picked Members that 
would fit her and the Democrats’ nar-
rative. 
It seems the story line has already 
been decided. We need to ensure that it 
is, as stated, intended to investigate 
and 
report 
upon 
the 
facts, 
cir-
cumstances, and causes relating to 
January 
6. 
Unfortunately, 
Speaker 
PELOSI
and the Democrats made it 
clear early on that this committee and 
its investigation outcome was pre-
determined when it tilted representa-
tion in favor of Democrats and, again, 
rejected the two Republican Members 
selected to serve on the Commission by 
the minority leader. 
Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned 
about the precedent being set here 
today as the majority, yet again, em-
barks on another investigation 
in 
search of a crime. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the rule and the underlying res-
olution, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my good friend from 
Minnesota said we wouldn’t be in this 
position if we had done what the Re-
publicans had asked us to do. We did. 
And I include in the RECORD the let-
ter that the minority leader, KEVIN 
MCCARTHY, sent to Speaker PELOSI re-
questing a number of items. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, February 22, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: We are in agree-
ment that the best path forward for bipar-
tisan legislation is to create an impartial 
and bipartisan Commission. 
In keeping with the suggestions from the 
Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commission, the legis-
lation the House puts forward should mirror 
the precedents that fairly and successfully 
governed that Commission. Simply put, 
House Republicans are asking for no more 
and no less than what Congress came to-
gether and agreed upon in the past. Specifi-
cally, those precedents include: 
An equal 5–5 ratio in appointments by 
Democrats and Republicans 
Co-Equal Subpoena Power for the Chair 
and Vice Chair of the Commission 
No inclusion of findings or other predeter-
mined conclusions which ultimately should 
be rendered by the Commission itself 
As the Co-Chairs of the Commission stated, 
a ‘‘bipartisan independent investigation will 
earn credibility with the American public.’’ I 
am confident that following their procedures 
and precedents can do just that, in a way 
that an overtly partisan commission will not 
be able to. 
Thank you and I look forward to hearing 
your response. 
Sincerely, 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House Republican Leader. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, those 
items include: an equal 5:5 ratio on a 
committee; coequal subpoena power; no 
inclusion of findings of other predeter-
mined conclusions which ultimately 
should be rendered by the Commission 
itself. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
Committee 
on 
Homeland Security agreed to every one 
of them—every single one of them. And 
what did the Republicans do? They 
said, Well, we didn’t think you would 
agree to everything, but we still don’t 
want the Commission. So they voted

against it. And then they blocked it in 
the United States Senate. 
So don’t talk to me about partisan-
ship or bipartisanship when it was very 
clear early on that my friends on the 
other side had no intention of wanting 
to work with us to get to the truth, be-
cause they couldn’t take yes for an an-
swer. 
Mr. Speaker, let me also point out 
that today, President Trump issued a 
statement—he had to issue a statement 
because he can’t tweet anymore be-
cause of mistruths and embrace of vio-
lence. Anyway, he issued a statement 
today. This is what he said: 
The statement says, ‘‘The insurrec-
tion took place on November 3, elec-
tion day. January 6 was the protest!’’ 
Let me just say that one more time. 
Trump said today in a statement, 
‘‘The insurrection took place on No-
vember 3, election day. January 6 was 
a protest!’’ 
And by the way, he didn’t mention 
that it was a violent protest on Janu-
ary 6. 
Mr. Speaker, are any of my Repub-
lican colleagues, aside from Congress-
woman 
CHENEY
and Representative 
KINZINGER, who have shown courage 
and patriotism, are any of them willing 
to come to the floor and say unequivo-
cally that the election on November 3 
was not an insurrection, as the former 
President has now said? 
It was a free and fair election held by 
one of the oldest democracies in the 
world. And that used to mean some-
thing to my Republican friends. Please, 
please. The former occupant of the 
White House is trying to tear this 
country apart. And unfortunately, too 
many on the other side are going along 
with him. Enough. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, with 
all respect to my colleague from Mas-
sachusetts, the fact still remains that 
when the minority leader did try to 
participate in this Commission, the 
Speaker rejected the two nominees 
that the minority leader had offered. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER). 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my good friend and fellow 
Rules Committee member, Representa-
tive FISCHBACH, for allowing me the 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I really believe that the 
issue before us today comes down to a 
very simple question, and that is, what 
is the legislative purpose of the Select 
Committee subpoena on a private cit-
izen. This is a very narrow legal issue. 
And what the courts have held is that 
Congress has the power to secure infor-
mation ‘‘in order to legislate.’’ So in 
other words, Congress’s subpoena au-
thority is valid only if it relates to the 
furtherance of a legitimate task of 
Congress. 
Now, according to the Select Com-
mittee’s own press release, the com-
mittee is attempting to tell a story and 
to find out what happened that day. 
But the courts have already deter-
mined that that is not a valid legisla-
tive purpose. 
In the 1957 decision, Watkins v. The 
United States, the Court held that Con-
gress has ‘‘no general authority to ex-
pose the private affairs of individuals 
without justification in terms of the 
functions of Congress.’’ Additionally, 
the quote went on in that case to say 
Congress cannot investigate private 
citizens for ‘‘the sake of exposure.’’ 
So then what is the legislative pur-
pose before us today? What is the legis-
lative purpose of a subpoena on a pri-
vate citizen, including 11 individuals 
who merely filed and were granted per-
mits to exercise their First Amend-
ment rights to assemble and to peti-
tion the government? This cannot be 
perceived as an investigation and still 
fit within the framework of case law. 
Again, let’s be clear, the law is crys-
tal clear here. If Congress does not 
have a legitimate legislative function, 
they simply cannot subpoena a private 
individual. 
Now, the Constitution gives those 
powers to the executive and the judici-
ary branch. They don’t give that power 
to Congress. So I can, therefore, only 
conclude that the purpose of the reso-
lution before us today is to fulfill a 
partisan agenda. 
If the Select Committee was actually 
serious about conducting a legitimate 
oversight, they would subpoena the 
former House Sergeant at Arms and 
the former head of the D.C. National 
Guard. That would be an investigation 
within the clear purpose of Congress 
and within the delegated power that we 
have in the Constitution. 
Instead, we are here voting on a reso-
lution with absolutely no legislative 
purpose. We are also setting a dan-
gerous precedent that will have a 
chilling effect on the rights of private 
citizens in the future. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I was hoping that some-
one on the other side would respond to 
former President Trump’s statement 
today, which I find stunning and 
shocking, but apparently they don’t 
want to talk about that. They want to 
talk about legislative purpose. When 
we get to the bill, I will let the com-
mittee members respond to that. 
I do want to say one thing again; 
that Speaker PELOSI was committed to 
a truly bipartisan commission, and we 
did a bipartisan commission—a truly 
bipartisan commission. My friends on 
the other side of the aisle tried to un-
dercut it and get their friends over in 
the Senate to tank it. That is what 
happened. They basically destroyed 
what could have been a bipartisan com-
mission that, quite frankly, was the 
way we all wanted to go. 
But 
then 
they 
said, 
well, 
she 
wouldn’t let us put who we wanted on 
this current commission. Well, the mi-
nority leader suggested Mr. JORDAN to 
be the lead Republican, and he very 
well may be a material witness in this 
investigation. You would put him on to 
oversee an investigation of, what, him-
self and others? 
Give me a break. What is going on 
here? At least be honest enough with 
the American people to say what is 
going on here; and that is, you don’t 
want to get to the truth about what 
happened on January 6. You never did; 
notwithstanding the violence that oc-
curred right here in this Chamber, in 
this sacred building. 
So, please, let’s not get into this, Oh, 
we wanted to cooperate but somehow 
you wouldn’t let us. We gave you ev-
erything you wanted, and you could 
not take yes for an answer. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAS-
CRELL). 
Mr. 
PASCRELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise for truth and ac-
countability. That is why we are here. 
We are dealing with common crimi-
nals. You see a guy running down the 
street in this city with a television on 
his back strapped to it, you start to 
wonder. We have had enough of those 
incidents to indicate to us that is what 
we are dealing with. 
The gravest attack ever on the U.S. 
democracy came 288 days ago. It was 
born of lies. Steve Bannon spread those 
poisonous lies, and Bannon was guided 
by the dictator. We must pursue the 
truth. We go only where the facts take 
us. Refusing a subpoena is obstructing 
justice. We don’t allow the plaintiff to 
prosecute or to decide. We decide it 
through the courts. If you can’t take 
the Constitution, go to Russia. It 
shows you have something to hide. 
What are you hiding? 
This is a vote of conscience. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
The time of the gentleman has ex-
pired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, refus-
ing a subpoena is obstructing justice. 
This is a vote of conscience. 
Do you agree with the rioting terror-
ists or our democracy? Are we a coun-
try of laws or a country of men? 
We must hold all involved account-
able; this includes those who attacked 
the police and those organizers who 
spread the lies, and the President who 
organized it. 
This is America, not Russia. 
b 1245 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will offer 
an amendment to the rule to provide 
for the additional consideration of H.R. 
5586, the Prohibiting IRS Financial 
Surveillance Act, authored by Rep-
resentative FERGUSON.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5741 
October 21, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include the text of the amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with the ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, re-
quiring 
banks 
and 
Federal 
credit 
unions to disclose personal details 
about their customers’ accounts is an 
extreme invasion of privacy, and it 
would have terrible implications for 
community banks and credit unions in 
my district and across the country. 
I suppose I really shouldn’t be sur-
prised about this egregious attempt on 
behalf of the Democrats. They clearly 
want as much government involvement 
as possible in every possible part of 
American citizens’ lives. I may not be 
surprised anymore, but I continue to be 
disappointed that they refuse to listen 
to the American citizens who time and 
time again say they want Big Govern-
ment out of their lives and their wal-
lets. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FER-
GUSON). 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the previous question. 
There is absolutely no denying that the 
Democrats want to control every part 
of your life by allowing the IRS to 
snoop into your bank accounts. 
This is wrong. And for what? It is 
really truly all about control. This un-
lawful surveillance is their latest gam-
bit. 
The 
Democrats’ 
snooping 
scheme 
would include hiring 87,000 new IRS 
agents at a cost of almost $80 billion. 
That is almost enough IRS agents to 
fill up Sanford Stadium at the Univer-
sity of Georgia for a Saturday football 
game. Now, I will take a college foot-
ball stadium full of SEC fans cheering 
on the Dawgs, but not one full of IRS 
agents. 
The proposal that the Democrats 
have put out claims to only go after 
wealthy tax cheats, but at its core, this 
is going to target every single farmer, 
every single family, every single gig 
worker, every single small business 
owner, and just about anyone who pays 
rent or pays a mortgage. 
Their bogus attempts to scale it back 
are meaningless. At any number, this 
is wrong. Think about how long it 
would take, paying $200 a month out of 
your bank account, or $200 a week out 
of your bank account, to get to the 
$10,000 number that they have pro-
posed. 
Mr. Speaker, simply put, the Demo-
crats’ IRS surveillance plan is flat out 
wrong. It is an outright violation of 
the Fourth Amendment of every Amer-
ican. Government has no business sift-
ing through our personal information. 
This is a foundational principle that 
this country was built on. 
I will say it again. Whether the 
amount is $1, $600, $10,000, or $1 million, 
giving the IRS this kind of unfettered 
and unchecked power is wrong. The 
threshold 
is 
irrelevant. 
Americans 
know that this is wrong. We know it is 
wrong, and our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle know that it is wrong. 
Our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are so desperate to find rev-
enue to fund their Big Government so-
cialist programs that they are willing 
to violate the constitutional rights of 
our fellow Americans. This is wrong. It 
is egregious on every front. Once again, 
we know it; they know it; the Amer-
ican people know it; and that is why we 
are pushing back. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat the previous question so that we 
can restore some reason and sanity and 
put an end to this absurd proposal for 
the IRS to snoop on Americans’ bank 
accounts. 
Defeat the previous question so we 
can vote to prohibit IRS financial sur-
veillance of Americans’ bank accounts. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not going to waste 
my time debating this information. 
What my friend is talking about is a 
false government takeover. What about 
the people who tried to take over our 
democracy on January 6? What about 
what happened here on January 6? 
Why is there no interest in getting to 
the truth? They come with this in-
stead. Again, I am still waiting for 
somebody to respond to President 
Trump’s statement that insurrection 
day took place on November 3. Do you 
really believe that? Is that what we 
have come to, that my friends on the 
other side would embrace such a shock-
ing and such an offensive statement? 
We had a free and fair election, and 
this is what the former President—who 
my friends are all so afraid of—says. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON), a distinguished member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this rule and the un-
derlying resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, there are moments in 
our country’s history when we are pre-
sented with stark choices, choices be-
tween right and wrong. And the vio-
lence of January 6 has made it clear 
that we are at such a moment. January 
6 was a shocking assault on our govern-
ment. 
On the orders of the former Presi-
dent, thousands of rioters destroyed 
public property, gravely injured police 
officers, terrorized lawmakers, and in-
vaded the Capitol to halt the certifi-
cation of the electoral college required 
by the Constitution. That day cannot 
be minimized or swept under the carpet 
because the forces that inspired that 
attack are still stoking the fires of 
chaos and conspiracy. 
Congress has tasked a bipartisan se-
lect committee with investigating the 
January 6 attack, and that committee 
has 
outlined 
why 
it 
needs 
Steve 
Bannon’s testimony to fully under-
stand the events leading up to that at-
tack. 
However, when subpoenaed to testify, 
Mr. Bannon told the select committee 
to pound sand. Mr. Bannon is a private 
citizen; he is not above the law and 
cannot refuse to obey a subpoena any 
more than you or I or any American 
can. Neither Mr. Bannon nor the 
former President has made any cred-
ible legal arguments to shield his testi-
mony. 
Patriotism 
demands 
that 
anyone 
with knowledge of that dark day come 
forward, and the rule of law and our 
Constitution demand that everyone in 
this Congress support this investiga-
tion. 
I am incredibly disappointed that Re-
publican leadership and so many of 
their colleagues continue to oppose any 
attempt to investigate the January 6 
attack. They opposed legislation to 
create a bipartisan commission. They 
opposed the creation of the select com-
mittee. And they are now trying to 
prevent the committee from carrying 
out its work. 
This is not a time for games or 
delays, all of which have allowed the 
former President and his allies, like 
Mr. Bannon, to escape accountability 
thus far. This is a time for courage, the 
courage to protect our Constitution 
and our national integrity. 
I am grateful to the members of the 
select committee for having the cour-
age to put loyalty to country over par-
tisan politics. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of 
my colleagues to support this rule. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON). 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota for 
yielding to me today. 
Mr. Speaker, President Biden and 
Speaker PELOSI are moving full steam 
ahead with their Big Government, big 
spending vision for this country. One of 
the most egregious proposals in their 
multitrillion-dollar 
reconciliation 
package would give the IRS access to 
nearly every single American’s bank 
account by requiring financial institu-
tions, like your local bank or your 
credit union, to report every account 
with more than $10,000 of transactions 
annually to the IRS. 
This proposal would give the IRS un-
precedented access to sensitive per-
sonal information and unprecedented 
power 
to 
target 
working 
families 
across Iowa and across America. This 
government snooping is a complete in-
vasion of privacy and a massive over-
reach into our lives and our liveli-
hoods. 
This spying scheme is a lose, lose, 
lose. It will increase the existing back-
log at the IRS exponentially. It will 
jeopardize the privacy of millions of 
Americans. It will destroy our commu-
nity financial institutions. And it will 
hurt rural communities and working 
families hardest of all. 
Democrats claim this is about tax 
evasion. Everyone should pay the taxes

that they owe. That is not the argu-
ment here. But this misguided proposal 
isn’t about tracking down missing rev-
enue; it is about expanded government 
control, plain and simple. 
This proposal, by design, will hit nor-
mal working families’ bank accounts. 
A total of $10,000 in transactions in a 
year, that is a year’s rent or a series of 
farm equipment bills, for example. The 
IRS should be focused on being more 
efficient 
at 
its 
current 
job, 
not 
emboldened and certainly not un-
leashed on hardworking Americans. 
We do not need to be throwing more 
money at the IRS to put Americans’ 
daily transactions under a microscope. 
Iowans have been very clear with me. 
They do not want the IRS snooping 
around in their bank accounts at that 
granular level. 
I have also heard very serious con-
cerns from our community financial 
institutions. These are the folks that 
are helping our farmers, our families, 
and our small businesses access credit. 
They told me this proposal could force 
them to shut down for good, leaving 
Iowans without access to credit and 
capital that they need to help keep our 
rural economy going to fuel and feed 
the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
put a stop to this madness and stand up 
for our constituents by voting ‘‘no’’ on 
the previous question, keeping the gov-
ernment out of Americans’ bank ac-
counts. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
just remind everybody that democracy 
doesn’t defend itself; people have to de-
fend democracy. It would be nice to see 
a little courage on the other side of the 
aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the chairman of 
the Democratic Caucus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished gentleman and chair 
of the Rules Committee for yielding 
and for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, the House is a separate 
and coequal branch of government. We 
are the institution that is closest to 
the people. The House has a sacred ob-
ligation under the Constitution to de-
fend our democracy, and we should be 
doing that in a bipartisan way, but 
something has happened to the mod-
ern-day Republican Party. 
The party of Abraham Lincoln is 
gone. The party of Ronald Reagan is 
gone. The party of John McCain is 
gone. A cult of personality has risen up 
to take its place. 
Is that why my colleagues refuse to 
denounce the former President’s lie ut-
tered today, that the real insurrection 
was on November 3? 
Take back your party. You can start 
today. You can start right here. You 
can start by holding Steve Bannon ac-
countable for his blanket defiance of a 
congressional subpoena. 
What is wrong with Steve Bannon? 
There is no cult exception to the 
United States Constitution. There is a 
legitimate, bipartisan congressional in-
vestigation that is underway into the 
violent insurrection and attack on the 
Capitol on January 6. It was an assault 
on the Congress, the Constitution, and 
the country. 
A lawful subpoena has been issued 
that Steve Bannon should comply with. 
We must hold Steve Bannon account-
able for his blanket defiance of a con-
gressional subpoena, for undermining 
the rule of law, and for obstructing a 
congressional investigation because, in 
America, no one, no one, no one is 
above the law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER). 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Minnesota for the 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the previous question so that we can 
immediately consider H.R. 5586. 
This bill would kill a Biden adminis-
tration proposal that would allow IRS 
agents to comb through the bank ac-
counts of any American who spends 
more than $10,000 a year. 
To put that in perspective, $10,000 a 
year equates to just $28 a day, $850 a 
month, or half of the average Min-
nesota mortgage payment. In other 
words, the Biden administration wants 
the IRS to be able to spy on tens of 
millions of Americans. 
Don’t be mistaken. This proposal 
does not just target the 1 percent, as 
the 
President 
sometimes 
likes 
to 
claim. Instead, it is pointed directly at 
working American families. 
Today, I led a letter, with more than 
200 of my colleagues, urging Treasury 
Secretary Janet Yellen to scrap this 
proposal to spy on American citizens. 
This is not China. We must protect 
Americans’ right to privacy and stop 
this proposed intrusive, unnecessary 
Biden financial reporting requirement. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
just say, not only will my Republican 
friends not condemn the President’s 
outrageous and unacceptable and un-
conscionable 
statement 
today, 
but 
they won’t even talk about what we are 
here for. 
That is what fear looks like, and it is 
really unbelievably sad. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the rule and the underlying res-
olution. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to start by say-
ing that this is not just about Mr. 
Bannon. This is about our rule of law, 
our democracy, and protecting it for 
future generations. 
On January 6, a mob, incited by the 
lies of a political leader, descended on 
the Capitol. Nooses, vandalism, death 
threats to elected officials, Americans 
remember the violence that took place 
here. 
b 1300 
Beltway chatter often focuses on the 
winners and losers of that day. But on 
that day, we all lost. Americans lost 
their lives, and we nearly lost our de-
mocracy. That is why we created a bi-
partisan January 6 commission. We 
know that unless we do our jobs, the 
ultimate losers will be future genera-
tions who will wonder what happened 
to our Nation. 
The commission’s work is serious and 
has no time for the games of Mr. 
Bannon or anyone else who would dis-
regard the rule of law. Our Constitu-
tion and our courts have made it clear 
that Congress has the power to inves-
tigate. This power is vital to the pro-
tection of our democracy, and it must 
be respected. 
I think a lot about our late, dear col-
league, 
Elijah 
Cummings, 
and 
his 
words still sit with me. He said that 
when we are dancing with the angels, 
the question will be asked: What did we 
do to ensure we kept our democracy in-
tact? 
I stand before you, Mr. Speaker, with 
that quote on my heart, thinking of 
my own four grandchildren and when 
they learn of January 6, they will see a 
time when America descended into vio-
lence, destruction, and desecration; 
when Americans attacked Americans 
and threatened our democracy. 
And what did I do? 
What did we all do to protect our de-
mocracy? 
So I lend my voice to hold Mr. 
Bannon in contempt and support the 
bipartisan select committee for their 
work in keeping our democracy and 
our future intact. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), who is the rank-
ing member of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, as my good friend from 
Georgia explained, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, we will immediately 
move to bring up H.R. 5586. This bill is 
critically important to ensure there 
will be no expansion of Internal Rev-
enue Service requirements for financial 
institutions to report the ins and outs 
of bank accounts. 
Members may remember this issue 
during the debate on ObamaCare when 
the Democrats tried to require anyone 
who received a payment of more than 
$600 to be given a 1099. People were 
rightly outraged by this provision, and 
it was repealed before it ever went into 
effect. Now, with their new reconcili-
ation bill, the Democratic majority is 
again looking for payfors and are will-
ing to sacrifice the privacy of all 
Americans in that quest. Every thresh-
old being discussed for inclusion will 
give the IRS full access to what is in 
the bank account of every American. 
And what is the justification for 
that, Mr. Speaker? 
It is to help the IRS to identify tax 
cheats. Well, I can tell you, Mr. Speak-
er, the Democratic proposal will make

everyone who pays rent or a mortgage 
a target and won’t do anything to help 
the IRS close the tax gap. 
Mr. Speaker, the Democratic plan is 
an astonishing breach of privacy. Giv-
ing the IRS the power to snoop around 
financial accounts, even with no accu-
sation of wrongdoing, violates every 
protection against government over-
reach. Americans have a reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy in their homes and 
in their personal lives, including their 
financial lives. Yet, if the majority has 
their way, the IRS will be empowered 
to go digging around in the bank ac-
counts 
of 
everyday 
Americans 
in 
search of wrongdoing. That is simply 
beyond the pale. 
We have seen what can happen when 
the IRS abuses its power. It was only a 
few short years ago that the IRS was 
targeting political and religious orga-
nizations for their beliefs, an aston-
ishing violation of their First Amend-
ment rights. 
What the IRS needs, Mr. Speaker, is 
oversight and accountability, and that 
is why we need to bring up and pass 
H.R. 5586 today. Only this will ensure 
that the IRS is not granted unprece-
dented power to intervene in the lives 
of and invade the privacy of ordinary 
Americans. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), who is the distin-
guished majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman of the Rules Committee 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution ought to 
be supported, and the underlying ac-
tion that the rule provides for ought to 
be supported by every Member of this 
House who believes that this House has 
a constitutional responsibility of over-
sight, of protecting the Constitution 
and the democracy in which we all are 
privileged to live, and the integrity of 
this House. 
Oversight is not possible for this 
House if, in fact, it cannot request and, 
indeed, demand the testimony of those 
who 
have 
information 
which 
this 
House, the people’s House and the pro-
tector of our democracy and our Con-
stitution, needs to protect our democ-
racy. This rule and the underlying ac-
tion for which it provides is essential. 
Mr. Speaker, if I were trying a case, 
I would offer as Exhibit A a statement 
by the man who would be dictator, 
Donald Trump, who absurdly and, of 
course, incorrectly says the insurrec-
tion took place on November 3, elec-
tion day. January 6 was the protest. 
My view is that man, Donald J. 
Trump, protests too much, because I 
believe that he recruited, incited, and 
deployed an insurrectionist mob to 
threaten this institution, its Members, 
its constitutional responsibility in the 
electoral process of the Presidency of 
the United States, and democracy 
itself. 
Mr. Speaker, the events of January 6 
exposed threats to our democracy that 
must be fully understood and ad-
dressed. It is a weighty responsibility 
that falls to the House Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol, a 
bipartisan committee. 
I want to thank Chairman THOMPSON, 
Vice Chair CHENEY, and all of those 
serving on this committee for their 
commitment to seeking the truth, de-
fending our democracy, and to giving 
sufficient information to our public 
and our constituents, our people, that 
they know this to be a stark and dan-
gerous lie. 
The committee is doing a diligent job 
at finding the truth. This task should 
not have fallen to the members of a se-
lect committee, this subpoena for con-
tempt. We should have been able to 
come together, Democrats and Repub-
licans, to create a bipartisan commis-
sion in the style of the 9/11 Commis-
sion, recognizing that such consequen-
tial and transformative attacks require 
us to come together as one nation indi-
visible to seek answers and identify so-
lutions to make our country safer. 
Sadly, however, we have come to a 
place where one party is so focused on 
defending the indefensible that this in-
stitution cannot act as Americans but, 
rather, are relegated to acting simply 
as partisans. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, I am 
heartened to see Democrats and some 
courageous Republicans working to-
gether to uncover the truth of what 
happened that day. These Republican 
Members are exhibiting what President 
Kennedy would call profiles in courage. 
In order for this committee to per-
form its work in full—indeed any com-
mittee of the Congress to perform its 
work in full—ultimately it has to be 
able to get the information that it 
needs from those who know the infor-
mation it needs. It must hear testi-
mony from all those who may have in-
formation regarding the events of Jan-
uary 6 in this particular case. That is 
why we provided the committee with 
subpoena authority. 
Steve Bannon’s refusal to appear, 
even when subpoenaed is, A, a dem-
onstration of his contempt, not only 
for Congress but his contempt of the 
Constitution and his contempt for the 
law. It is unacceptable and obstructive 
to this process of uncovering the full 
story of that day’s attack on the Cap-
itol. He must be found in contempt, not 
as a Democrat and not as a Republican, 
but on behalf of this institution and 
the people whom we represent. 
Withholding 
information 
on 
the 
events of that day from the committee 
is no less than an act of betrayal of the 
American people and of our constitu-
tional democracy. 
The American people need to under-
stand what led to the violent insurrec-
tion that sought to overturn our elec-
tion and led to the deaths of multiple 
police officers and others; although, as 
I said, Exhibit A, the former Presi-
dent’s comments, should be the proof 
in and of itself the American people 
need to understand what led to the 
deaths of those police officers and the 
placing at risk the democratic process 
of electing a President of the United 
States. 
We need to understand, Mr. Speaker, 
how this could have happened, why it 
happened, and what ought to be done 
to hold the perpetrators accountable 
and prevent the events of the day from 
being repeated. 
That appears to be the fear on the 
floor of this House today: account-
ability, 
responsibility, 
and 
con-
sequences. 
In refusing to appear before the com-
mission, Mr. Bannon has made it clear 
where his loyalties lie. He has chosen 
Trump first and America last, not 
America first. Trump first, America 
last. Trump first, our Constitution 
last. Trump first, our democracy last. 
Trump first, the House of the people, 
this House of Representatives last. And 
he will have to answer for that to us. 
This is a moment of reckoning for 
our 
country, 
reckoning 
with 
hard 
truths and painful memories, a reck-
oning that, above all, requires truth 
and understanding. 
Can’t we, Mr. Speaker, in a bipar-
tisan way summon the courage to look 
the truth in the eye and vote the 
truth? 
We cannot allow anyone to shirk 
their responsibility to share that truth 
and help the American people under-
stand. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the 
House to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution 
and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the citation for 
contempt so that Chairman THOMPSON, 
Vice Chairwoman CHENEY, and the 
members of the select committee can 
make it clear to Mr. Bannon and to all 
others summoned to testify they will 
seek the truth, the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth as they deter-
mine what we must do to protect our 
beloved country, our beloved Constitu-
tion, and our beloved democracy.

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
as explained prior, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, we will immediately 
move to bring up H.R. 5586. This bill 
prohibits the expansion of the Internal 
Revenue Service’s requirements for fi-
nancial institutions to report bank ac-
count transactions. 
The Biden administration is search-
ing for ways to pay for their partisan 
$5.5 trillion social policy bill, and one 
of the Democrats’ proposed solutions is 
to spy on taxpayers’ bank accounts. 
Their proposal would require finan-
cial institutions and service providers 
to report data on accounts that deposit 
or withdraw more than $600 or maybe 
$10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service 
to help ensure that Americans are pay-
ing their fair share in taxes. 
Democrats claim that this regulatory 
expansion would only impact wealthy 
Americans and businesses. But in re-
ality, it targets virtually all working- 
class people in our Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5744 
October 21, 2021 
This government overreach would be 
an enormous violation of privacy, jeop-
ardize the financial security of all 
Americans, 
and 
impose 
significant 
compliance costs on financial institu-
tions. 
Through this proposal, the Demo-
crats are looking to weaponize the IRS 
by creating a new surveillance pro-
gram, which would allow them to mon-
itor every single bank account without 
permission or limit. In order to con-
duct this surveillance on Americans, 
the provision includes $80 billion to 
double the number of IRS agents, 
which would be six times the size of the 
IRS’ annual budget. 
This plan was initially included in 
the massive budget reconciliation bill 
and has now since been removed after 
pushback from financial institutions 
and customers. But it is still being con-
sidered for passage. 
Regardless, my House Republican 
colleagues and I are doing what we can 
to protect the financial security and 
privacy of the American people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Oklahoma. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. I have re-
cently written a letter to Speaker 
PELOSI, 
Chairman 
NEAL, 
Secretary 
Yellen, and Commissioner Rettig to ex-
press my concerns of overburdening the 
data collection system, exposing mil-
lions 
of 
Americans 
to 
potential 
cyberattacks, and how distrust in 
banks negatively impacts our econ-
omy. 
Additionally, I signed on to a letter 
and cosponsored two bills that directly 
address this pressing issue. The letter 
to Secretary Yellen expressed the con-
cern of more Americans unbanking due 
to privacy concerns and distrust in 
banks and how applying extra report-
ing requirements for financial institu-
tions would be incredibly burdensome. 
The U.S. Government should not 
have the authority to spy on bank ac-
counts of American taxpayers. The 
Biden administration’s proposal would 
significantly impact the working class, 
invade privacy, pose financial security 
threats for Americans and businesses, 
and further burden institutions. House 
Republicans are working tirelessly to 
put a stop to this government over-
reach and protect the American peo-
ple’s security, privacy, and trust in 
this great Nation. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentle-
woman updating us on the bills that 
she has cosponsored and her opinions 
about the IRS, which have nothing to 
do with the underlying bill that we are 
debating here today. But it is stunning 
to me that neither she nor any of my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
will respond to what the former occu-
pant of the White House said today in 
a statement, that the insurrection 
took place on November 3; that our 
election, our lawful election in one of 
the oldest democracies in the world, 
was somehow an insurrection; and that 
January 6 was merely a protest. 
I am stunned by this. I challenge the 
next speaker, please, can you say that 
you disassociate yourself with this 
statement? Can you make it clear to 
the American people that you want no 
part of this? I get it. You endorsed this 
man. He campaigned for you. You are 
afraid of his base. You are afraid every 
time he says anything. But the bottom 
line is, this statement needs to be con-
demned, and the unwillingness of any-
body on the other side to condemn this 
statement is unconscionable. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, they won’t 
question Trump’s statement that the 
insurrection was November 3 because 
that is the day each and every one of 
them and each and every one of us was 
elected. It was a free and fair election 
when 
it 
came 
to 
electing 
Congresspeople, but for President, they 
think it was an insurrection. Horse ma-
nure. 
Bannon, who was thumbing his nose 
at the Constitution and this Congress 
by not responding to his subpoena, said 
that it would be different than on elec-
tion day, on January 6. It wouldn’t go 
as expected, because he was part of 
plotting what was an overthrow of our 
government. 
He was pardoned by President Trump 
for ripping off Trump supporters. He 
got them to give money to an effort to 
build the wall, and he took over $1 mil-
lion for his own personal expenses. 
Fraud. But Trump didn’t care that he 
ripped off Trump people for a Trump 
wall. He pardoned him. The whole 
thing is a con game, and we need to end 
it before democracy goes out the win-
dow. 
I urge you to support the rule and the 
underlying resolution. Protect America 
and protect democracy. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD). 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my colleague from Minnesota 
for yielding and Mr. FERGUSON for lead-
ing this effort. 
If the previous question is defeated, 
we will amend the rule and imme-
diately consider H.R. 5586, the Prohib-
iting IRS Financial Surveillance Act. 
This legislation would prohibit the 
Treasury Department and the IRS from 
implementing any new financial ac-
count surveillance regimes. This is a 
direct response to this administration’s 
invasive proposal that would require fi-
nancial institutions to report trans-
action data on every American’s bank 
account that meets their proposed 
threshold. 
I am deeply skeptical of the need for 
this dangerous expansion of IRS over-
sight and believe it to be a significant 
risk to individual privacy. The Demo-
crats are leading the American people 
to believe that this is needed to target 
wealthy tax cheats and to help close 
the tax gap. Unfortunately, this pro-
posal, even with a $10,000 threshold, 
would subject Americans at every rung 
of the economic ladder to these oner-
ous reporting requirements. This in-
cludes 
middle-class 
families, 
small 
business owners, and farmers. 
Even with proposed carve-outs, this 
proposal would turn local banks into 
IRS reporting units, which is not only 
incredibly burdensome but also costly. 
I have already been hearing from local 
bankers in Morton and Liberty, Illi-
nois, and throughout my district who 
are deeply concerned about how this 
proposal will encourage their cus-
tomers to empty out their bank ac-
counts, 
further 
exacerbating 
the 
unbanked-banked divide. 
In a letter dated September 29, 2021, 
the Department of the Treasury cited 
that the IRS experiences 1.4 billion 
cyberattacks a year. I don’t know a 
single American who would like to 
have their personal data reported to a 
system that is highly targeted by 
hackers and foreign adversaries. In ad-
dition, the IRS’ track record for leak-
ing personal information raises serious 
questions about their ability to imple-
ment a program of this scale. 
I am proud to join my friend, Con-
gressman FERGUSON, in his effort to 
protect Americans’ privacy, and I urge 
my colleagues to defeat the previous 
question. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, when 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Minnesota 
yielded the gentleman from Illinois an 
additional minute, I was kind of hope-
ful that maybe he would be the one to 
say that he disassociates himself from 
the statement of Donald Trump today 
in which he said that the insurrection 
took place on November 3, election 
day. 
I would be happy to yield 30 seconds 
to him if he wants to say that this was 
a statement that is not only uncon-
scionable but that every American 
should condemn. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN), the majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman MCGOVERN for yielding me 
the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I often quote George 
Santayana, who warned: ‘‘Those who 
cannot remember the past are con-
demned to repeat it.’’ 
The insurrection on January 6 was 
the worst attack on our Constitution 
since the Civil War. While the seces-
sionists were defeated in 1865, our Na-
tion’s experiment with multiracial de-
mocracy during Reconstruction did not 
last. 
It was extinguished by the Lost 
Cause mythology that minimized the 
evils of the secessionists and raised 
monuments to the leaders of the Con-
federacy that they established. These 
willful circumventions and misrepre-
sentations were used as justification

for avoiding accountability and vio-
lently stripping African Americans of 
constitutional rights. 
We are at risk of repeating that his-
tory today. Just as the Lost Cause laid 
the ideological groundwork for Jim 
Crow and all its inhumanities, the big 
lie seeks to justify nullification laws 
that seek to suppress votes and estab-
lish autocratic rule. 
The 
former 
President 
and 
his 
enablers are using the big lie to deny 
the horror of January 6. They are at-
tempting to obstruct and subvert the 
select committee’s work and to prevent 
a full accounting of their efforts to un-
dermine our democracy. 
We know from our history that when 
our government is attacked, failing to 
hold 
the 
perpetrators 
accountable 
emboldens them. Allowing their myths 
to gain currency incentivizes them. 
And underestimating their disregard 
for their fellow citizens enables them 
to deny those citizens their constitu-
tional rights. 
I urge adoption of this resolution so 
that we avoid repeating the past, at 
least that part of our past that dehu-
manizes our fellow citizens. We must 
act to strengthen our democracy and 
build a better future for our country so 
that it can once again be the envy of 
the world. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, while 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle are singularly focused on the hap-
penings only within the walls of Cap-
itol Hill, the rest of us, working fami-
lies, are struggling with the con-
sequences of this failed administration, 
including rising inflation; pending un-
employment; border threats; increased 
drugs and violence in our neighbor-
hoods; and an out-of-control, power- 
hungry administration. 
I cannot explain the chairman’s and 
majority 
leader’s 
absolute 
and 
unhealthy obsession with a former 
President, but I sincerely urge them to 
seek treatment so that they can focus 
on the insurmountable harms that are 
being caused by the current adminis-
tration and how they are currently 
forcing them on all of the American 
people. 
I rise in opposition to the previous 
question so that the House can imme-
diately consider H.R. 5586, legislation 
critical to stopping the Democrats’ 
unending attempts to control every as-
pect of American lives. 
Now the left is in an unrelenting pur-
suit of tracking every penny you and 
your family personally earn and spend. 
If the price tag for their socialist poli-
cies weren’t alarming enough, what is 
hidden inside the bill should truly hor-
rify all Americans. 
If you pay rent, if you buy groceries, 
or pay a mortgage, you are going to be 
subject to surveillance. From the low-
est income earners on up, every Amer-
ican will be checked. 
Thousands more IRS bureaucrats will 
be hired for their new surveillance pro-
gram, with authority to monitor every 
transaction you make. Every account 
transaction would be traced and re-
ported to the Federal Government, edg-
ing us closer and closer to a com-
munist-controlled police state. 
Republicans are unified in our fight 
against this new surveillance program. 
My friend and ranking member, KEVIN 
BRADY, led the charge to stop this 
early on, but not a single Democrat 
stood up for Americans’ financial pri-
vacy. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. First, things are 
reported and monitored, and then they 
are controlled. We cannot let Demo-
crats push us down this dangerous and 
slippery slope. 
b 1330 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, oh, my God, can some-
body, please—I beg of you on the other 
side—can somebody, please, disasso-
ciate yourself or condemn the state-
ment by the former President who said 
today that the insurrection took place 
on November 3? 
All my colleagues were elected on 
November 3 as well. If you believe that 
election day was an insurrection, then 
your election results are illegitimate. 
Can somebody, please, for the sake of 
our democracy, say that what was said 
by the former President is wrong? 
Please. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH). 
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, 
like my colleagues today, I rise in op-
position to the previous question so 
that we can immediately consider H.R. 
5586, Prohibiting IRS Financial Sur-
veillance Act. 
Mr. Speaker, Hoosiers are outraged. 
My friends across the aisle would have 
you believe that it is just the Hoosier 
financial institutions that are outraged 
at having to hand over the personal ac-
count information of their customers. 
It is, in fact, those account owners that 
are outraged at the notion that my 
friends across the aisle would build an 
apparatus to surveil and snoop in their 
personal bank accounts. 
Now, their horror only grows as I an-
swer questions for them. First, they 
ask, surely this must apply only to the 
super rich and not to me. But I reply, 
no, it applies to you if you spend just 
over $200 a week. 
Then they will ask, surely this must 
only apply to those that are suspected 
of a crime. And I say, no, it is collec-
tion on every account, irrespective of 
whether there is a suspected crime or 
tax evasion afoot. 
Then, of course, they will ask me, 
surely the IRS has a very good track 
record of keeping this data safe. And I 
have to reply, no, the track record, in 
fact, indicates the opposite. The IRS 
has a terrible track record of keeping 
this data safe against the intrusion of 
actors from around the world and right 
here at home. 
And then they say, well, surely the 
IRS has a good track record of not mo-
bilizing this data for political purposes. 
And yet, again, I have to say, no, in 
fact, the evidence indicates the IRS has 
mobilized this data for their own polit-
ical purposes and for the political pur-
poses across the aisle. 
My friends, this is horrifying, this 
surveillance state that is trying to be 
built. Hoosiers understand what is 
being asked of them. Trillions of dol-
lars are being proposed to be spent, and 
now they are being asked to give up 
their personal information from their 
personal bank accounts to foot that 
bill for my colleagues across the aisle. 
I hope this stops here. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know if this 
microphone is working, because I am 
not sure my colleagues can hear me 
when I have asked them over and over 
again, can you please disassociate 
yourself from the former President’s 
statement today? It is important. It is 
on topic. 
By the way, what the gentleman just 
talked about has nothing to do with 
what we are talking about today. It is 
amazing that nobody wants to talk 
about what is on the floor today. 
But my constituents, when they talk 
to me, you know what they are fearful 
about? They are fearful about losing 
our democracy in their lifetime. And 
the inability or the unwillingness of 
my friends on the other side to be able 
to 
disassociate 
themselves 
with 
a 
statement by the former President, 
which today he said the election on No-
vember 3 was somehow the insurrec-
tion. It is stunning to me. He is tearing 
this country apart, and the silence and 
the indifference on the other side is 
aiding him in his quest to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI), my good 
friend. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the previous question. If we 
defeat the previous question, Repub-
licans will amend the rule to include 
H.R. 5586, the Prohibiting IRS Finan-
cial Surveillance Act, legislation to 
prevent the IRS from snooping into 
Americans’ 
personal 
financial 
ac-
counts. 
Under President Biden and Congres-
sional Democrats’ policies, American 
families continue to be squeezed by in-
flation at the gas pump, at the grocery 
store, and in their monthly energy 
bills. But this inflation squeeze isn’t 
enough for them. Now, they want to 
monitor the average American’s bank 
account. As part of Democrats’ mis-
guided tax-and-spending spree, they

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5746 
October 21, 2021 
have proposed new reporting require-
ments, from financial institutions to 
the IRS, regarding private account in-
formation. 
This 
vast 
government 
overreach 
would turn financial institutions in my 
district into local outposts of the IRS, 
all with the sole purpose of reporting 
Hoosiers’ personal financial account 
information back to the Government. 
Make no mistake, this will capture vir-
tually every American, who will be 
subject to increased levels of IRS in-
trusion in their daily lives. 
The IRS already has been challenged 
by the leak of thousands of documents, 
including sensitive taxpayer informa-
tion. The collection of additional data 
would only exacerbate this problem 
and subject many Americans to the po-
tential exposure of their personal infor-
mation. Let’s not forget, under the 
Obama administration, the IRS sys-
tematically targeted certain groups ap-
plying for tax-exempt status simply be-
cause of their political affiliation. 
I hope that we can defeat the pre-
vious question to protect the privacy of 
all Americans and to ensure that the 
IRS won’t be surveilling every finan-
cial transaction. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the previous question. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing. 
Mr. Speaker, the majority has chosen 
to turn the committee into a vehicle to 
push their own narrative, and it is 
clearly more interested in pursuing a 
partisan agenda to politicize January 6 
rather than conducting a legitimate, 
good-faith investigation into the secu-
rity failures leading up to that day. 
As my colleague from Pennsylvania 
pointed out, where is the legitimate 
legislative 
purpose? 
The 
Members 
across the aisle have yet to address 
what kind of legitimate legislative pur-
poses could, might, or even possibly 
come out of the commission investiga-
tion. 
A lawful subpoena, according to the 
Supreme Court, needs to serve a legiti-
mate legislative purpose. The majority 
leader used words like ‘‘oversight,’’ 
‘‘the American people need to under-
stand,’’ and ‘‘hold perpetrators ac-
countable.’’ These statements do not 
qualify as a legitimate legislative pur-
pose. 
This is nothing more than an at-
tempt by the Democrats to distract 
from the very real issues facing Ameri-
cans every day. I look forward to get-
ting back to the real work of solving 
the supply chain issues, reclaiming 
American energy production, and em-
powering U.S. citizens to live their 
lives without government interference 
or surveillance. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the previous 
question, the rule, and the underlying 
legislation, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has 21⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I can’t adequately ex-
press the outrage I feel about what 
happened in this institution on Janu-
ary 6. It was not only an attack on this 
building; it was an attack on our de-
mocracy. 
I will tell you, if we don’t have our 
democracy intact, you are not going to 
fix the supply chain issues or the en-
ergy issues or any other issues. 
Our democracy is in peril. It was at-
tacked on January 6. 
Mr. Speaker, I am the chairman of 
the Rules Committee, so I understand 
what the rules of the House are, so I 
cannot say what I really feel about 
what went on in this Chamber today 
with this debate. I am disgusted, to be 
quite honest with you. 
We are trying to get to the bottom of 
what happened on January 6, and many 
on the other side have done everything 
they could to frustrate that effort. 
Now, we have somebody who doesn’t 
want to comply with a subpoena, and 
we are saying we are going to put some 
force behind that. We need to be able to 
do our oversight. We need to get to the 
truth, and my friends are trying to 
frustrate that. 
Then today, former President Trump 
issues a statement saying insurrection 
day took place on November 3. That 
was election day, when we were all 
elected. That is what he thought? That 
is what he thinks was an insurrection? 
And January 6 was just a protest. 
We were all here that day. We saw 
the violence. People lost their lives 
that day. People were wounded that 
day. People were traumatized by that 
day. Again, it was not just an attack 
on this building and the people who 
work here; it was an attack on our de-
mocracy. 
And my friends on the other side of 
the aisle can’t even muster the courage 
to say that the former President was 
wrong in his statement. That is what 
fear looks like. That is what fear of 
Donald Trump looks like. It is so sad 
that a once great party has come to 
this. 
I said it earlier. Members come and 
go. I know people are all worried about 
the latest polls and where our base is 
and what political implications will 
come from this or that. But at the end 
of the day, you ought to be worried 
about your legacy, about what your 
children and grandchildren think. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and ‘‘yes’’ on 
the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 727 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
5586) to prohibit the implementation of new 
requirements to report bank account depos-
its and withdrawals. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
The bill shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill 
are waived. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Financial Services; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 3: Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 5586. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 221, nays

RECOMMENDING THAT THE HOUSE 
FIND STEPHEN K. BANNON IN 
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, by the direction of 
the Select Committee to Investigate 
the January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol, I call up the report (H. 
Rept. 117–152) and accompanying reso-
lution recommending that the House of 
Representatives 
find 
Stephen 
K. 
Bannon in contempt of Congress for re-
fusal to comply with a subpoena duly 
issued by the Select Committee to In-
vestigate the January 6th Attack on 
the United States Capitol. 
The Clerk read the title of the report. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 727, the report 
is considered read. 
The text of the report is as follows: 
The Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the United States 
Capitol, having considered this Report, re-
ports favorably thereon and recommends 
that the Report be approved. 
The form of the Resolution that the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol would 
recommend to the House of Representatives 
for citing Stephen K. Bannon for contempt of 
Congress pursuant to this Report is as fol-
lows: 
Resolved, That Stephen K. Bannon shall be 
found to be in contempt of Congress for fail-
ure to comply with a congressional sub-
poena. 
Resolved, That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 
and 194, the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives shall certify the report of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, 
detailing the refusal of Stephen K. Bannon 
to produce documents or appear for a deposi-
tion before the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol as directed by subpoena, to 
the United States Attorney for the District 
of Columbia, to the end that Mr. Bannon be 
proceeded against in the manner and form 
provided by law. 
Resolved, That the Speaker of the House 
shall otherwise take all appropriate action 
to enforce the subpoena. 
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY 
On January 6, 2021, a violent mob breached 
the security perimeter of the United States 
Capitol, assaulted and injured scores of po-
lice officers, engaged in hand-to-hand vio-
lence with those officers over an extended 
period, and invaded and occupied the Capitol 
building, all in an effort to halt the lawful 
counting of electoral votes and reverse the 
results of the 2020 election. In the words of 
many of those who participated in the vio-
lence, the attack was a direct response to 
false statements by then-President Donald J. 
Trump—beginning on election night 2020 and 
continuing through January 6, 2021—that the 
2020 election had been stolen by corrupted 
voting machines, widespread fraud, and oth-
erwise. 
In response, the House adopted House Res-
olution 503 on June 30, 2021, establishing the 
Select Committee to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘Select Com-
mittee’’). 
The Select Committee is investigating the 
facts, circumstances, and causes of the Janu-
ary 6th attack and issues relating to the 
peaceful transfer of power, in order to iden-
tify how the events of January 6th were 
planned, what actions and statements moti-
vated and contributed to the attack on the 
Capitol, how the violent riot that day was 
coordinated with a political and public rela-
tions strategy to reverse the election out-
come, and why Capitol security was insuffi-
cient to address what occurred. The Select 
Committee will evaluate all facets of these 
issues, create a public record of what oc-
curred, and recommend to the House, and its 
relevant committees, corrective laws, poli-
cies, procedures, rules, or regulations. 
According to many published reports, and 
his own public statements, Stephen K. 
Bannon had specific knowledge about the 
events planned for January 6th before they 
occurred. He said on his January 5th 
podcasts, for example: 
It’s not going to happen like you think it’s 
going to happen. OK, it’s going to be quite 
extraordinarily different. All I can say is, 
strap in. [. . .] You made this happen and to-
morrow it’s game day. So strap in. Let’s get 
ready. 
All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. 
[. . .] So many people said, ‘Man, if I was in 
a revolution, I would be in Washington.’ 
Well, this is your time in history. 
Mr. Bannon appears to have had multiple 
roles relevant to this investigation, includ-
ing his role in constructing and participating 
in the ‘‘stop the steal’’ public relations effort 
that motivated the attack, his efforts to 
plan political and other activity in advance 
of January 6th, and his participation in the 
events of that day from a ‘‘war room’’ orga-
nized at the Willard InterContinental Wash-
ington D.C. Hotel (the ‘‘Willard Hotel’’). Al-
though he was a private citizen not em-
ployed by the White House at the time, he 
reportedly spoke with Mr. Trump directly re-
garding the plans for January 6th on at least 
one occasion. In short, Mr. Bannon appears 
to have played a multi-faceted role in the 
events of January 6th, and the American 
people are entitled to hear his first-hand tes-
timony regarding his actions. The Select 
Committee expects that such testimony will 
be directly relevant to its report and rec-
ommendations for legislative and other ac-
tion. 
On September 23, 2021, Chairman BENNIE G. 
THOMPSON signed a subpoena for documents 
and testimony and transmitted it along with 
a cover letter and schedule to counsel for Mr. 
Bannon, 
who 
accepted 
service 
on 
Mr. 
Bannon’s behalf on September 24, 2021. The 
subpoena required that Mr. Bannon produce 
responsive documents not later than October 
7, 2021, and that Mr. Bannon appear for a dep-
osition on October 14, 2021. Subsequent com-
munications between counsel for Mr. Bannon 
and Chairman THOMPSON, however, failed to 
reach any accommodation for Mr. Bannon’s 
appearance for testimony or production of 
documents. Indeed, counsel for Mr. Bannon 
on October 7, 2021, flatly stated that Mr. 
Bannon would not produce any documents or 
appear at the scheduled deposition, as or-
dered by the lawful subpoena. Although Mr. 
Bannon’s counsel referenced vague claims of 
executive privilege purportedly relayed by 
the former President, no such claims have 
been presented by the former President to 
the Select Committee. And although the Se-
lect Committee is confident that such claims 
could not bar any of its requests, there is no 
conceivable executive privilege claim that 
could bar all of the Select Committee’s re-
quests or justify Mr. Bannon’s flat refusal to 
appear for the required deposition. The 
Chairman’s October 8, 2021, response ad-
dressed the legal arguments raised by Mr. 
Bannon’s counsel and made clear that the 
Select Committee expected—as the law de-
mands—that Mr. Bannon appear before the 
Select Committee at his deposition and raise 
any privilege or other concerns regarding 
specific questions on the record of that pro-
ceeding. 
The contempt of Congress statute, 2 U.S.C. 
§ 192, makes clear that a witness summoned 
before Congress must appear or be ‘‘deemed 
guilty of a misdemeanor’’ punishable by a 
fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for 
up to 1 year. Further, the Supreme Court in 
United States v. Bryan (1950) emphasized that 
the subpoena power is a ‘‘public duty, which 
every person within the jurisdiction of the 
Government is bound to perform when prop-
erly summoned.’’ The Supreme Court re-
cently reinforced this clear obligation by 
stating that ‘‘[w]hen Congress seeks infor-
mation needed for intelligent legislative ac-
tion, it unquestionably remains the duty of 
all citizens to cooperate.’’ 
Mr. Bannon did not produce documents by 
the subpoena’s October 7, 2021, deadline nor 
did he appear for a deposition scheduled for 
October 14, 2021, as ordered by the subpoena 
and in contravention of the clear instruc-
tions by the Select Committee Chairman on 
October 8, 2021, to appear at the deposition 
and raise any privilege concerns in response 
to specific questions on the record. Mr. 
Bannon’s refusal to comply with the Select 
Committee’s subpoena in any way represents 
willful default under the law and warrants 
contempt of Congress and referral to the 
United States Attorney for the District of 
Columbia for prosecution as prescribed by 
law. The denial of the information sought by 
the subpoena impairs Congress’s central 
powers under the United States Constitu-
tion. 
BACKGROUND ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE’S 
INVESTIGATION 
House Resolution 503 sets out the specific 
purposes of the Select Committee, including: 
to investigate and report upon the facts, 
circumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the 
January 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack 
upon the United States Capitol Complex’’; 
to investigate and report upon the facts, 
circumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the 
interference with the peaceful transfer of 
power’’; and 
to investigate and report upon the facts, 
circumstances, and causes relating to ‘‘the

October 21, 2021 
influencing factors that fomented such an 
attack on American representative democ-
racy while engaged in a constitutional proc-
ess.’’ 
The Supreme Court has long recognized 
Congress’s oversight role. ‘‘The power of the 
Congress to conduct investigations is inher-
ent in the legislative process.’’ Indeed, 
Congress’s ability to enforce its investiga-
tory power ‘‘is an essential and appropriate 
auxiliary to the legislative function.’’ ‘‘Ab-
sent such a power, a legislative body could 
not ‘wisely or effectively’ evaluate those 
conditions ‘which the legislation is intended 
to affect or change.’ ’’ 
The oversight powers of House and Senate 
committees are also codified in legislation. 
For example, the Legislative Reorganization 
Act of 1946 directed committees to ‘‘exercise 
continuous watchfulness’’ over the executive 
branch’s implementation of programs within 
its jurisdictions, and the Legislative Reorga-
nization Act of 1970 authorized committees 
to ‘‘review and study, on a continuing basis, 
the application, administration, and execu-
tion’’ of laws. 
Pursuant to House rule XI and House Reso-
lution 503, the Select Committee is author-
ized ‘‘to require, by subpoena or otherwise, 
the attendance and testimony of such wit-
nesses and the production of books, records, 
correspondence, memoranda, papers, and 
documents as it considers necessary.’’ Fur-
ther, section 5(c)(4) of House Resolution 503 
provides that the Chairman of the Select 
Committee may ‘‘authorize and issue sub-
poenas pursuant to clause 2(m) of rule XI in 
the investigation and study’’ conducted pur-
suant to the enumerated purposes and func-
tions of the Select Committee. The Select 
Committee’s authorizing resolution further 
states that the Chairman ‘‘may order the 
taking of depositions, including pursuant to 
subpoena, by a Member or counsel of the Se-
lect Committee, in the same manner as a 
standing committee pursuant to section 
3(b)(1) of House Resolution 8, One Hundred 
Seventeenth Congress.’’ 
A. The Select Committee seeks information from 
Mr. Bannon central to its investigative pur-
poses 
Mr. Bannon’s testimony and document pro-
duction are critical to the Select Commit-
tee’s investigation. Among other topics, the 
Select Committee seeks facts that explain 
why the events of January 6th turned vio-
lent. Statements publicly made by Mr. 
Bannon on January 5, 2021, suggest that he 
had some foreknowledge about extreme 
events that would occur the next day. Mr. 
Bannon noted on January 5th that the coun-
try was facing a ‘‘constitutional crisis’’ and 
‘‘that crisis is about to go up about five or-
ders of magnitude tomorrow.’’ He also stated 
that, ‘‘All hell is going to break loose tomor-
row. [. . .] It’s not going to happen like you 
think it’s going to happen. OK, it’s going to 
be quite extraordinarily different.’’ Con-
gress, through the Select Committee, is enti-
tled to discover facts concerning the activi-
ties leading up to the violence on January 
6th. Under House Resolution 503, the Select 
Committee is directed to investigate those 
facts, which include ‘‘the influencing factors 
that fomented such an attack.’’ And after 
making public statements on January 5th 
like those quoted above, Mr. Bannon is 
obliged by law to comply with the reasonable 
requests of the Select Committee through its 
subpoena. If any witness so close to the 
events leading up to the January 6th attack 
could decline to provide information to the 
Select Committee, Congress would be se-
verely hamstrung in its ability to exercise 
its constitutional powers with highly rel-
evant information informing its choices. In-
formation in Mr. Bannon’s possession is es-
sential to putting other witnesses’ testimony 
and productions into appropriate context 
and to ensuring the Select Committee can 
fully and expeditiously complete its work. 
Mr. Bannon was the Chief Executive Offi-
cer of Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential cam-
paign and served as then-President Trump’s 
chief strategist, a White House position, for 
8 months in 2017. Mr. Trump fired Mr. 
Bannon in August 2017, and Mr. Bannon did 
not thereafter hold a position in the execu-
tive branch. 
After Mr. Bannon left government service, 
he remained actively involved in media and 
politics. In October 2019, Mr. Bannon began a 
radio show and podcast focused on rallying 
supporters of Mr. Trump in support of var-
ious causes and issues. According to one re-
port, before the election even occurred in 
2020, Mr. Bannon made public efforts to ex-
plain ‘‘his belief that the Democrats are 
plotting to steal the 2020 election.’’ One ac-
count of conversations involving Mr. Bannon 
(and Mr. Trump) prior to January 6th de-
scribes Mr. Bannon as encouraging Mr. 
Trump to ‘‘focus on January 6th’’ and articu-
lating a plan to have millions of Americans 
consider Mr. Biden an illegitimate President. 
That same reporting suggests that Mr. 
Bannon was in frequent contact with the 
White House in late-December and early- 
January and spoke directly with the Presi-
dent several times. Mr. Bannon is reported 
to have urged then-President Trump to pres-
sure then-Vice President Michael R. Pence 
to assist in overturning the results of the 
2020 election. 
Mr. Bannon was reportedly encouraging 
President Trump’s supporters to take dra-
matic action. According to one report, im-
mediately after the November 3rd election, 
Mr. Bannon began promoting false con-
spiracy claims that the election had been 
stolen and referred to the election as ‘‘a 
mass fraud.’’ 
The day before the January 6th attack on 
the Capitol, Mr. Bannon predicted that ‘‘All 
hell is going to break loose tomorrow.’’ He 
told the listeners of his radio show: 
It’s not going to happen like you think it’s 
going to happen. OK, it’s going to be quite 
extraordinarily different. All I can say is, 
strap in. [. . .] You made this happen and to-
morrow it’s game day. So strap in. Let’s get 
ready. 
He added: 
So many people said, ‘‘Man, if I was in a 
revolution, I would be in Washington.’’ Well, 
this is your time in history.26 
And: 
It’s all converging, and now we’re on the 
point of attack tomorrow.27 
Public reporting also suggests that Mr. 
Bannon was among several prominent sup-
porters of efforts to undermine the election 
results who gathered at the Willard Hotel, 
two blocks from the White House, on the 
days surrounding the January 6th attack.28 
The group that assembled at the Willard 
Hotel is reported to have included members 
of the Trump campaign’s legal team (includ-
ing Rudolph Giuliani and John Eastman), 
several prominent proponents of false elec-
tion fraud claims that had been promoted by 
Mr. Trump (e.g., Russell Ramsland, Jr. and 
Boris Epshteyn), as well as Roger Stone, who 
left the hotel with Oath Keeper bodyguards, 
and campaign spokesman Jason Miller.29 It 
has been reported that the participants in 
the meetings at the Willard Hotel discussed 
plans to stop or delay the January 6th count-
ing of the election results and persuade 
Members of Congress to block the electoral 
count.30 
Mr. Bannon’s statements the day before 
the January 6th attack, and his association 
with both the Trump inner circle and outside 
groups involved in the ‘‘Stop the Steal’’ 31 
events, make his testimony about the Wil-
lard Hotel meetings essential to fully under-
standing and establishing responsibility for 
the events of January 6th. In addition to the 
indications 
noted 
above 
regarding 
Mr. 
Bannon’s role in various activities leading 
up to January 6th, he also reportedly spoke 
directly to Mr. Trump on one or more occa-
sions regarding what could or should happen 
on January 6th.32 
B. Mr. Bannon’s refusal to comply with the Se-
lect Committee’s subpoena for testimony and 
documents 
On September 23, 2021, Chairman THOMPSON 
signed and transmitted a subpoena, cover 
letter, and schedule to Mr. Bannon ordering 
the production of both documents and testi-
mony relevant to the Select Committee’s in-
vestigation into ‘‘important activities that 
led to and informed the events at the Capitol 
on January 6, 2021.’’ 33 Chairman THOMPSON’s 
letter identified public reports describing 
Mr. Bannon’s activities and past statements, 
documenting some of the public information 
that gave the Select Committee reason to 
believe Mr. Bannon possesses information 
about matters within the scope of the Select 
Committee’s inquiry. 
The 
specific 
documents 
requested 
are 
found in the schedule in the Appendix, Ex-
hibit 1, (pp. 4–5). The schedule included with 
the subpoena addressed topics including but 
not limited to Mr. Bannon’s role in planning 
and promoting the January 6, 2021, rally and 
march in support of Mr. Trump; Mr. Trump’s 
participation in the rally and march; Mr. 
Bannon’s podcast and its use for promoting 
the rally and march; and Mr. Bannon’s stra-
tegic communications with a host of individ-
uals known to be involved with the former 
President’s 2020 election campaign and sub-
sequent efforts to undermine or cast doubt 
on the results of that election. 
The subpoena required Mr. Bannon to 
produce the requested documents to the Se-
lect Committee on October 7, 2021, at 10 a.m. 
and required Mr. Bannon’s presence for the 
taking of testimony on October 14, 2021, at 10 
a.m.34 Mr. Bannon had designated Robert J. 
Costello as his attorney for the purposes of 
the Select Committee’s inquiry, and Mr. Cos-
tello accepted service of the subpoena on be-
half of Mr. Bannon on September 24, 2021.35 
On October 7, 2021, at 10 a.m., at the des-
ignated location identified in the subpoena, 
Mr. Bannon failed to appear and produce doc-
uments. Instead, over 7 hours later, Mr. Cos-
tello sent a letter to Chairman THOMPSON via 
email at 5:04 p.m. reinforcing Mr. Bannon’s 
refusal to comply. 
Mr. Costello’s letter cited an October 6, 
2021, letter from former President Trump’s 
counsel Justin Clark to Mr. Costello that 
purportedly instructed Mr. Bannon to ‘‘in-
voke any immunities and privileges he may 
have 
from 
compelled 
testimony,’’ 
‘‘not 
produce any documents concerning privi-
leged material,’’ and ‘‘not provide any testi-
mony concerning privileged material[.]’’ 36 
Mr. Costello’s letter then asserted that Mr. 
Bannon was ‘‘legally unable to comply,’’ 
with the subpoena for ‘‘documents or testi-
mony,’’ claiming to rely on the instructions 
of Mr. Trump to not disclose privileged in-
formation.37 The two-page letter contained 
only conclusory statements, no legal anal-
ysis, and approximately half of it purported 
to quote from the letter of October 6, 2021, 
from the counsel to Mr. Trump. 
On October 8, 2021, Chairman THOMPSON re-
sponded to Mr. Costello’s October 7, 2021, let-
ter.38 He said that Mr. Trump had not com-
municated an invocation of privilege either 
formally or informally to the Select Com-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5750 
October 21, 2021 
the information the Select Committee seeks 
from Mr. Bannon concerns his actions as a 
private citizen and involves a range of sub-
jects not even conceivably reached by any 
executive 
privilege 
assertion. 
Chairman 
THOMPSON also noted that—even assuming 
Mr. Bannon were correct that a privilege ap-
plied to his documents and testimony and 
Mr. Trump had formally invoked a privilege 
through the long-standing practice of con-
sultation with the current President (which 
is not the case)—Mr. Bannon does not enjoy 
anything like the type of absolute immunity 
his attorney suggested would insulate Mr. 
Bannon from an obligation to comply with 
the Select Committee’s subpoena. Again, 
there is no conceivable legal claim to sup-
port such an assertion. 
The 
Chairman 
underscored 
that 
Mr. 
Bannon remained obligated to produce docu-
ments and testimony about all non-privi-
leged material that was responsive to the 
subpoena, was expected to produce a privi-
lege log identifying any documents being 
withheld based on any specific privilege 
claims, and that the Select Committee ex-
pected Mr. Bannon to appear at the deposi-
tion on October 14th and state on the record 
any privilege concerns raised by specific 
questions. As made clear by the deposition 
rules provided to Mr. Bannon by the Select 
Committee, under House deposition regula-
tion 3, Mr. Bannon may be accompanied at 
the deposition by a personal, nongovern-
mental counsel to advise him of his rights.39 
The Chairman concluded by saying that 
Mr. Bannon was therefore not in compliance 
with the Chairman’s duly issued subpoena 
for documents, and that the Select Com-
mittee would view refusal to produce docu-
ments and refusal to appear at the October 
14th deposition as willful non-compliance 
with the subpoena. The Chairman warned 
that this willful non-compliance would put 
Mr. Bannon in jeopardy of a vote to refer 
him to the House to consider a criminal con-
tempt referral to a U.S. Attorney pursuant 
to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 and 194.40 
On October 13, 2021, at approximately 12:35 
p.m., Select Committee staff emailed Mr. 
Costello to discuss logistics for the deposi-
tion at which Mr. Bannon was compelled to 
appear on October 14, 2021, at 10 a.m. Ap-
proximately an hour later, Select Committee 
staff and Mr. Costello spoke on the tele-
phone, during which Mr. Costello informed 
the Select Committee that Mr. Bannon 
would not appear the next day, and that a 
letter to that effect was forthcoming. Mr. 
Costello indicated that he was in contact 
with Mr. Trump’s attorney, and he had in-
formed Mr. Trump’s attorney of the Select 
Committee’s explanation of the deficiencies 
in Mr. Bannon’s and Mr. Trump’s justifica-
tions for Mr. Bannon’s defiance of the sub-
poena. 
On that call, Mr. Costello represented to 
the Select Committee that he had asked Mr. 
Trump’s counsel to identify, with specificity, 
communications for which executive privi-
lege would apply. Later that day, Mr. Cos-
tello transmitted a response to Chairman 
THOMPSON’s October 8, 2021, letter. In that 
letter, Mr. Costello reiterated his position 
that Mr. Bannon’s refusal to comply with 
the Select Committee subpoena was based on 
the former President’s ‘‘executive and other 
privileges.’’ 41
Mr. Costello claimed that 
President Trump’s counsel had ‘‘exercis[ed] 
his executive privilege’’ and ‘‘directed Mr. 
Bannon not to produce documents or testify 
until the issue of executive privilege is re-
solved.’’ 42 He further stated that Mr. Bannon 
would refuse to produce any documents or 
appear for testimony until after a court had 
ruled on, or former President Trump and the 
Select Committee reached an agreement on, 
the matter of executive privilege that the 
former President had never actually commu-
nicated to the Select Committee. In defiance 
of the clear instructions by the Select Com-
mittee to appear at the deposition and state 
any privilege concerns as they applied to 
specific questions, Mr. Bannon refused to ap-
pear to make any objections in person. Fur-
ther, he refused to engage at all with the 
specifics of the document demands, including 
failing to provide a privilege log identifying 
any privilege claims regarding specific docu-
ments. 
On October 14, 2021, at 10 a.m., Mr. Bannon 
failed to appear at the designated location to 
provide testimony relevant to the Select 
Committee’s inquiry in response to questions 
posed, as was required by the subpoena.43 
At 2:05 p.m. on October 15, 2021, Chairman 
THOMPSON sent a letter to Mr. Costello not-
ing that Mr. Bannon had not even attempted 
to provide the Select Committee any expla-
nation for refusing to comply with the Select 
Committee’s demand for documents and tes-
timony on a range of subjects that do not in-
volve 
communications 
with 
the 
former 
President. The Chairman also reiterated that 
Mr. Bannon does not enjoy absolute immu-
nity from testifying before the Select Com-
mittee. The Chairman reminded Mr. Costello 
that 
the 
Select 
Committee 
views 
Mr. 
Bannon’s conduct as willful non-compliance 
with the subpoena. He notified Mr. Costello 
that, accordingly, the Select Committee 
would meet on October 19, 2021, to consider a 
criminal contempt referral for Mr. Bannon, 
and invited Mr. Costello to submit any writ-
ten materials he believed the Select Com-
mittee should consider in its deliberations 
on this referral. 
On October 18, 2021, Mr. Costello wrote 
Chairman Thompson requesting a ‘‘one-week 
adjournment of our response’’ to the Chair-
man’s October 15th letter, citing the need to 
‘‘assess’’ litigation Mr. Trump filed on Octo-
ber 18, 2021, concerning the Select Commit-
tee’s request for documents from the Na-
tional Archives.44 The Chairman replied on 
October 19, 2021, that Mr. Trump’s lawsuit 
was immaterial to the Select Committee’s 
subpoena to Mr. Bannon, and accordingly, no 
grounds existed for any further delay in Mr. 
Bannon’s compliance with the subpoena.45 
C. Mr. Bannon’s purported basis for non-com-
pliance is wholly without merit 
Mr. Bannon has relied on no legal author-
ity to support his refusal to comply in any 
fashion with the subpoena. Mr. Bannon’s re-
fusal to comply with the subpoena is osten-
sibly based on his decision to ‘‘honor [former 
President Trump’s] invocation of executive 
privilege’’ and instruction that, ‘‘to the full-
est extent permitted by law,’’ Mr. Bannon 
‘‘invoke any immunities and privileges he 
may have from compelled testimony,’’ ‘‘not 
produce any documents concerning privi-
leged material,’’ and ‘‘not provide any testi-
mony concerning privileged material.’’ 46 Far 
from 
being 
‘‘permitted 
by 
law,’’ 
Mr. 
Bannon’s conduct in response to the Select 
Committee’s subpoena constitutes a viola-
tion of the contempt of Congress statutory 
provisions. 
1. Executive privilege has not been invoked 
Mr. Trump has had no communication 
with the Select Committee. In an October 
7th letter to the Select Committee, Mr. 
Bannon’s attorney referred to purported cor-
respondence from Mr. Trump’s attorney, 
Justin Clark, in which Mr. Clark asserted 
that the Select Committee subpoena seeks 
information that is ‘‘potentially protected 
from disclosure by executive and other privi-
leges, including among others the presi-
dential communications, deliberative proc-
ess, and attorney-client privileges.’’ 47
Ac-
cording to Mr. Bannon’s attorney, Mr. Clark 
also stated that, ‘‘President Trump is pre-
pared to defend these fundamental privileges 
in court.’’ 48 
In United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 7–8 
(1953), the Supreme Court held that execu-
tive privilege: 
[B]elongs to the Government and must be 
asserted by it; it can neither be claimed nor 
waived by a private party. It is not to be 
lightly invoked. There must be a formal 
claim of privilege, lodged by the head of the 
department which has control over the mat-
ter, after actual personal consideration by 
that officer.49 
Here, the Select Committee has not been 
provided with any formal invocation of exec-
utive privilege by the President, the former 
President,50 or any other employee of the ex-
ecutive branch. 
In fact, in an October 18, 2021, letter to Mr. 
Bannon’s attorney, the White House Coun-
sel’s Office specifically stated that ‘‘at this 
point we are not aware of any basis for [Mr. 
Bannon’s] refusal to appear for a deposi-
tion.’’ The letter also informed Mr. Bannon’s 
counsel that: 
[P]resident Biden determined that an as-
sertion of executive privilege is not justified 
with respect to a set of documents shedding 
light on events within the White House on 
and about January 6, 2021, and with respect 
to documents and testimony concerning the 
former President’s efforts to use the Depart-
ment of Justice to advance a false narrative 
that the 2020 election was tainted by wide-
spread fraud. President Biden’s determina-
tion that an assertion of privilege is not jus-
tified with respect to these subjects applies 
to [Mr. Bannon’s] deposition testimony and 
to any documents [Mr. Bannon] may possess 
concerning either subject.51 
With respect to the former President, the 
Select Committee has not received a formal 
invocation 
of 
executive 
privilege. 
Mr. 
Costello’s October 13th letter merely states 
that the attorney for former President 
Trump had informed him that ‘‘President 
Trump is exercising his executive privilege.’’ 
This third-hand, non-specific assertion of 
privilege, without any description of the doc-
uments or testimony over which privilege is 
claimed, is insufficient to activate a claim of 
executive privilege. 
2. Even assuming an invocation of executive 
privilege (which is not justified here), as-
sertion of privilege could not bar the Se-
lect Committee from lawfully obtaining 
the documents and testimony it seeks from 
Mr. Bannon 
The Select Committee seeks information 
from Mr. Bannon on a wide range of subjects 
that it is inconceivable executive privilege 
would reach. Mr. Bannon was a private cit-
izen during the relevant time period and the 
testimony and documents the Select Com-
mittee is demanding do not concern discus-
sion of official government matters with the 
President and his immediate advisors. The 
law is clear that executive privilege does not 
extend to discussions between the President 
and private citizens relating to non-govern-
mental business or among private citizens. 
In United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 708 
(1974), the Supreme Court recognized a quali-
fied, presumptive privilege for presidential 
communications. The scope of the so-called 
‘‘presidential 
communications 
privilege’’ 
was further defined by the Court to apply 
only to ‘‘communications in performance of 
[a President’s] responsibilities of his office 
and made in the process of shaping policies 
and making decisions.’’ 52 
In In re Sealed Case (Espy), 121 F.3d 729, 752 
(D.C. Cir. 1997), the DC Circuit extended the 
presidential communications privilege to 
‘‘communications authored or solicited and 
received by those members of an immediate

October 21, 2021 
White House adviser’s staff who have broad 
and significant responsibility for inves-
tigating and formulating the advice to be 
given the President on the particular matter 
to which the communications relate.’’ The 
court stressed that the privilege only applies 
to communications intended to advise the 
President ‘‘on official government matters.’’ 53 
In Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Department of Jus-
tice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1123 (D.C. Cir. 2004), the 
court reaffirmed that the presidential com-
munications privilege applies only to docu-
ments ‘‘solicited and received by the Presi-
dent or his immediate advisers in the Office 
of the President.’’ Relying on In re Sealed 
Case and the principle that ‘‘the presidential 
communications privilege should be con-
strued as narrowly as is consistent with en-
suring that the confidentiality of the Presi-
dent’s decision-making process is adequately 
protected,’’ 54 the court refused to extend the 
privilege even to executive branch employees 
whose sole function was to provide advice to 
the President in the performance of a ‘‘quin-
tessential 
and 
nondelegable 
Presidential 
power.’’ 55 
Here, neither Mr. Bannon nor former Presi-
dent Trump has asserted that Mr. Bannon’s 
testimony would reveal communications in-
volving the President or members of his im-
mediate White House staff regarding the per-
formance of the President’s responsibilities 
of his office. At no point during the time pe-
riod under investigation by the Select Com-
mittee was Mr. Bannon a government em-
ployee, much less a key White House adviser 
in the Office of the President. Moreover, the 
matters under review by the Select Com-
mittee concern efforts to overturn legiti-
mate election results and an attack on our 
democratic institutions. Communications re-
garding these subjects (or any other matter 
related to the presidential campaign), by def-
inition, would not constitute advice on ‘‘offi-
cial government matters’’ that could be 
shielded by executive privilege. In any event, 
any confidentiality interest in such commu-
nications would be far outweighed by the 
oversight needs for this information that are 
at stake in the Select Committee’s inves-
tigation. 
In sum: In this instance, there is no rea-
sonable argument that Mr. Bannon’s commu-
nications with the President regarding Janu-
ary 6th are the type of matters on which 
privilege can be asserted. Also, the Select 
Committee is confident that no executive 
privilege assertion would bar Mr. Bannon’s 
testimony regarding his communications di-
rectly with the President regarding January 
6th—because the privilege is qualified and 
could be overcome by an appropriate show-
ing of need. Again, there is no conceivable 
assertion that privilege could apply to other 
information sought that does not constitute 
communications with Mr. Trump during his 
presidency. Beyond communications between 
Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump, the Select Com-
mittee seeks documents and testimony from 
Mr. Bannon regarding his own actions and 
interactions with other private citizens re-
lating to the events of January 6th. For ex-
ample, the subpoena to Mr. Bannon includes 
requests for documents related to many 
other matters, including: 
His presence, purpose, statements, and ac-
tivities at a meeting with Members of Con-
gress at the Willard Hotel on January 5, 2021, 
or the presence, purpose, statements, or ac-
tivities of others in attendance related to 
that meeting. 
Anyone with whom he communicated by 
any means with respect to any aspect of the 
planning, objectives, conduct, or participa-
tion in the January 6, 2021, rally, including 
but not limited to Boris Epshteyn. 
Anyone with whom he communicated with 
respect to efforts, plans, or proposals to con-
test the 2020 presidential election results or 
delay, influence, or impeded the electoral 
count, including but not limited to commu-
nications with Boris Epshteyn, Kashyap 
Patel, and Ezra Cohen-Watnick. 
All public relations, advertising, or other 
communications efforts to persuade Ameri-
cans that the election was stolen. 
The January 6, 2021, rally on The Mall and 
Capitol grounds in Washington, DC, in sup-
port of President Donald J. Trump and oppo-
sition to the counting of the results of the 
2020 presidential election, including its per-
mitting, planning, objectives, financing, and 
conduct, as well as any communications to 
or from any person or group involved in or-
ganizing or planning for the January 6, 2021, 
rally. 
The financing or fundraising to assist any 
individual’s or organization’s travel to or ac-
commodation in Washington, DC, to attend 
or participate in the January 6, 2021, rally. 
The ‘‘War Room’’ podcast, insofar as at 
any time he communicated through it state-
ments referring or relating to the January 6, 
2021, rally, including all statements con-
cerning its planning, objectives, purpose, or-
ganization, message, or sponsorship. 
The organization or group named ‘‘March 
for Trump’’ and its activities relating to the 
January 6, 2021, rally, including any commu-
nications Mr. Bannon had with any officer or 
member of ‘‘March for Trump’’ relating in 
any way to the planning, objectives, organi-
zation, message, sponsorship, and participa-
tion in the January 6, 2021, rally. 
No colorable claim of executive privilege 
could possibly be made with respect to docu-
ments or testimony related to these and 
other matters sought by the subpoena, or 
any other topics that were not connected to 
official decisionmaking by the President. 
3. Mr. Bannon is not entitled to absolute im-
munity 
Mr. Bannon has refused to provide any re-
sponsive documents or appear for a deposi-
tion based on his asserted reliance on Mr. 
Trump’s purported invocation of executive 
privilege. However, even if Mr. Trump had 
invoked executive privilege, and even if cer-
tain testimony or documents would fall 
within that privilege, Mr. Bannon would not 
be immune from compelled testimony before 
the Select Committee. 
The law is clear that even senior White 
House aides who advise the President on offi-
cial government business are not immune 
from compelled congressional process. To 
the extent there has been a formal invoca-
tion of executive privilege by the Office of 
the President, and in the unlikely event that 
testimony by Mr. Bannon relates to informa-
tion covered by that privilege, Mr. Bannon 
was nonetheless required to appear before 
the Select Committee to provide testimony 
and invoke executive privilege where appro-
priate. If there are responsive documents 
that Mr. Bannon claims include privileged 
information, he was required to provide the 
Select Committee with a privilege log that 
‘‘identifies and describes the material in a 
manner ‘sufficient to enable resolution of 
any privilege claims.’ ’’ Mr. Bannon did nei-
ther. He should be held in contempt. 
D. Precedent supports the Select Committee’s 
position to proceed with holding Mr. 
Bannon in contempt 
An individual who fails or refuses to com-
ply with a House subpoena may be cited for 
contempt of Congress. Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. § 
192, the willful refusal to comply with a con-
gressional subpoena is punishable by a fine 
of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 
1 year. A committee may vote to seek a con-
tempt citation against a recalcitrant wit-
ness. This action is then reported to the 
House. If a resolution to that end is adopted 
by the House, the matter is referred to a U.S. 
Attorney, who has a duty to refer the matter 
to a grand jury for an indictment. 
In his October 8th letter to Mr. Bannon’s 
counsel, the Chairman of the Select Com-
mittee advised Mr. Bannon that his claims of 
executive privilege were not well-founded 
and did not absolve him of his obligation to 
produce documents and testify in deposition. 
The Chairman made clear that the Select 
Committee expected Mr. Bannon to appear 
for his scheduled deposition on October 14th 
and produce the requested documents at that 
time. The Chairman warned Mr. Bannon that 
his continued non-compliance would put him 
in jeopardy of a vote to refer him to the 
House to consider a criminal contempt refer-
ral. Mr. Bannon’s failure to appear for depo-
sition or produce responsive documents in 
the face of this clear advisement and warn-
ing by the Chairman constitutes a willful 
failure to comply with the subpoena. 
SELECT COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION 
The Select Committee met on Tuesday, 
October 19, 2021, with a quorum being

tion of the confidentiality of executive com-
munications thus has always been limited

ministration leaves office’’). The Supreme 
Court in Nixon v. GSA made note of the fact 
that neither President Ford nor President 
Carter supported former President Nixon’s 
assertion of privilege, which, the Court said, 
‘‘detracts from the weight of his contention 
[that the disclosure of the information at 
issue] impermissibly intrudes into the execu-
tive function and the needs of the Executive 
Branch.’’ Id., p. 449.

* * * 
DEAR MR. BANNON: Pursuant to the au-
thorities set forth in House Resolution 503 
and the rules of the House of Representa-
tives, the Select Committee to Investigate 
the January 6th Attack on the United States 
Capitol (‘‘Select Committee’’) hereby trans-
mits a subpoena compelling you to produce 
the documents set forth in the accom-
panying schedule by October 7, 2021, and to 
appear for a deposition on October 14, 2021. 
The Select Committee is investigating the 
facts, circumstances, and causes of the Janu-
ary 6th attack and issues relating to the 
peaceful transfer of power, in order to iden-
tify and evaluate lessons learned and to rec-
ommend to the House and its relevant com-
mittees corrective laws, policies, procedures, 
rules, or regulations. This inquiry includes 
examination of how various individuals and 
entities coordinated their activities leading 
up to the events of January 6, 2021, 
The Select Committee has reason to be-
lieve that you have information relevant to 
understanding important activities that led 
to and informed the events at the Capitol on 
January 6, 2021. For example, you have been 
identified as present at the Willard Hotel on 
January 5, 2021, during an effort to persuade 
Members of Congress to block the certifi-
cation of the election the next day, and in 
relation to other activities on January 6.1 
You are also described as communicating 
with then-President Trump on December 30, 
2020, and potentially other occasions, urging 
him to plan for and focus his efforts on Janu-
ary 6.2 Moreover, you are quoted as stating, 
on January 5, 2021, that ‘‘[a]ll hell is going to 
break loose tomorrow.’’ 3 Accordingly, the 
Select Committee seeks both documents and 
your deposition testimony regarding these 
and multiple other matters that are within 
the scope of the Select Committee’s inquiry. 
A copy of the rules governing Select Com-
mittee depositions, and a copy of document 
production definitions and instructions are 
attached. Please contact staff for the Select 
Committee at 202–225–7800 to arrange for the 
production of documents. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman.

contact information of the entity or entities 
now in possession of the responsive docu-
ment(s). 
16. If a date or other descriptive detail set 
forth in this request referring to a document 
is inaccurate, but the actual date or other 
descriptive detail is known to you or is oth-
erwise apparent from the context of the re-
quest, produce all documents that would be 
responsive as if the date or other descriptive 
detail were correct. 
17. This request is continuing in nature and 
applies to any newly-discovered information.

* * * health, safety, and well-being of others 
present in the Chamber and surrounding 
areas. Members and staff will not be per-
mitted to enter the Hall of the House with-
out wearing a mask. Masks will be available 
at the entry points for any Member who for-
gets to bring one. The Chair views the failure 
to wear a mask as a serious breach of deco-
rum. The Sergeant-at-Arms is directed to en-
force this policy. Based upon the health and 
safety guidance from the attending physi-
cian and the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chair 
would further advise that all Members 
should leave the Chamber promptly after 
casting their votes. Furthermore, Members 
should avoid congregating in the rooms lead-
ing to the Chamber, including the Speaker’s 
lobby. The Chair will continue the practice 
of providing small groups of Members with a 
minimum of 5 minutes within which to cast 
their votes. Members are encouraged to vote 
with their previously assigned group. After 
voting, Members must clear the Chamber to 
allow the next group a safe and sufficient op-
portunity to vote. It is essential for the 
health and safety of Members, staff, and the 
U.S. Capitol Police to consistently practice 
social distancing and to ensure that a safe 
capacity be maintained in the Chamber at 
all times. To that end, the Chair appreciates 
the cooperation of Members and staff in pre-
serving order and decorum in the Chamber 
and in displaying respect and safety for one 
another by wearing a mask and practicing 
social distancing. All announced policies, in-
cluding those addressing decorum in debate 
and the conduct of votes by electronic de-
vice, shall be carried out in harmony with 
this policy during the pendency of a covered 
period. 
117TH CONGRESS REGULATIONS FOR USE 
OF DEPOSITION AUTHORITY 
COMMITTEE ON RULES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, January 4, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to section 3(b) 
of House Resolution 8, 117th Congress, I here-
by submit the following regulations regard-
ing the conduct of depositions by committee 
and select committee counsel for printing in 
the Congressional Record. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, Committee on Rules. 
REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF DEPOSITION 
AUTHORITY 
1. Notices for the taking of depositions 
shall specify the date, time, and place of ex-
amination. Depositions shall be taken under 
oath administered by a member or a person 
otherwise authorized to administer oaths. 
Depositions may continue from day to day. 
2. Consultation with the ranking minority 
member shall include three days’ notice be-
fore any deposition is taken. All members of 
the committee shall also receive three days 
written notice that a deposition will be 
taken, except in exigent circumstances. For 
purposes of these procedures, a day shall not 
include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holi-
days except when the House is in session on 
such a day. 
3. Witnesses may be accompanied at a dep-
osition by personal, nongovernmental coun-
sel to advise them of their rights. Only mem-
bers, committee staff designated by the 
chair or ranking minority member, an offi-
cial reporter, the witness, and the witness’s 
counsel are permitted to attend. Observers 
or counsel for other persons, including coun-
sel for government agencies, may not attend. 
4. The chair of the committee noticing the 
deposition may designate that deposition as 
part of a joint investigation between com-
mittees, and in that case, provide notice to 
the members of the committees. If such a 
designation is made, the chair and ranking 
minority member of the additional com-
mittee(s) may designate committee staff to 
attend pursuant to regulation 3. Members 
and designated staff of the committees may 
attend and ask questions as set forth below. 
5. A deposition shall be conducted by any 
member or committee counsel designated by 
the chair or ranking minority member of the 
Committee that noticed the deposition. 
When depositions are conducted by com-
mittee counsel, there shall be no more than 
two committee counsel permitted to ques-
tion a witness per round. One of the com-
mittee counsel shall be designated by the 
chair and the other by the ranking minority 
member per round. 
6. Deposition questions shall be pro-
pounded in rounds. The length of each round 
shall not exceed 60 minutes per side, and 
shall provide equal time to the majority and 
the minority. In each round, the member(s) 
or committee counsel designated by the 
chair shall ask questions first, and the mem-
ber(s) or committee counsel designated by 
the ranking minority member shall ask 
questions second. 
7. Objections must be stated concisely and 
in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive 
manner. A witness’s counsel may not in-
struct a witness to refuse to answer a ques-
tion, except to preserve a privilege. In the 
event of professional, ethical, or other mis-
conduct by the witness’s counsel during the 
deposition, the Committee may take any ap-
propriate disciplinary action. The witness 
may refuse to answer a question only to pre-
serve a privilege. When the witness has re-
fused to answer a question to preserve a 
privilege, members or staff may (i) proceed 
with the deposition, or (ii) either at that 
time or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling 
from the Chair either by telephone or other-
wise. If the Chair overrules any such objec-
tion and thereby orders a witness to answer 
any question to which an objection was 
lodged, the witness shall be ordered to an-
swer. If a member of the committee chooses 
to appeal the ruling of the chair, such appeal 
must be made within three days, in writing, 
and shall be preserved for committee consid-
eration. The Committee’s ruling on appeal 
shall be filed with the clerk of the Com-
mittee and shall be provided to the members 
and witness no less than three days before 
the reconvened deposition. A deponent who 
refuses to answer a question after being di-
rected to answer by the chair may be subject 
to sanction, except that no sanctions may be 
imposed if the ruling of the chair is reversed 
by the committee on appeal. 
8. The Committee chair shall ensure that 
the testimony is either transcribed or elec-
tronically recorded or both. If a witness’s 
testimony is transcribed, the witness or the 
witness’s counsel shall be afforded an oppor-
tunity to review a copy. No later than five 
days after the witness has been notified of 
the opportunity to review the transcript, the 
witness may submit suggested changes to 
the chair. Committee staff may make any 
typographical and technical changes. Sub-
stantive changes, modifications, clarifica-
tions, or amendments to the deposition tran-
script submitted by the witness must be ac-
companied by a letter signed by the witness 
requesting the changes and a statement of 
the witness’s reasons for each proposed 
change. Any substantive changes, modifica-
tions, clarifications, or amendments shall be 
included as an appendix to the transcript 
conditioned upon the witness signing the 
transcript. 
9. The individual administering the oath, if 
other than a member, shall certify on the 
transcript that the witness was duly sworn. 
The transcriber shall certify that the tran-
script is a true record of the testimony, and 
the transcript shall be filed, together with 
any electronic recording, with the clerk of 
the committee in Washington, DC. Deposi-
tions shall be considered to have been taken 
in Washington, DC, as well as the location 
actually taken once filed there with the 
clerk of the committee for the committee’s 
use. The chair and the ranking minority 
member shall be provided with a copy of the 
transcripts of the deposition at the same 
time. 
10. The chair and ranking minority mem-
ber shall consult regarding the release of 
deposition testimony, transcripts, or record-
ings, and portions thereof. If either objects 
in writing to a proposed release of a deposi-
tion testimony, transcript, or recording, or a 
portion thereof, the matter shall be prompt-
ly referred to the committee for resolution. 
11. A witness shall not be required to tes-
tify unless the witness has been provided 
with a copy of section 3(b) of H. Res. 8, 117th 
Congress, and these regulations.

Washington, DC, October 7, 2021.

Re: The Subpoena for Stephen K. Bannon 
dated September 23, 2021. 
DEAR * * * 
I write today on behalf of Stephen K. 
Bannon with respect to the above referenced 
subpoena, which I accepted on behalf of Mr. 
Bannon. On the afternoon of October 6, 2021, 
I received a letter from Justin Clark, as 
counsel for then President of the United 
States Donald J. Trump. That letter ref-
erences the subpoena that your Committee 
served upon Mr. Bannon, and notes that the 
subpoena: 
‘‘seeks records and testimony purportedly 
related to the events of January 6th, 2021, in-
cluding but not limited to information which 
is potentially protected from disclosure by 
executive and other privileges, including 
among others the presidential communica-
tions, deliberative process, and attorney-cli-
ent privileges. President Trump is prepared 
to defend these fundamental privileges in 
court. 
Therefore, to the fullest extent permitted 
by law, President Trump instructs Mr. 
Bannon to: (a) where appropriate, invoke any 
immunities and privileges he may have from 
compelled testimony in response to the Sub-
poena; (b) not produce any documents con-
cerning privileged material in response to 
the Subpoena; and (c) not provide any testi-
mony concerning privileged material in re-
sponse to the Subpoena.’’ 
It is therefore clear to us that since the ex-
ecutive 
privileges 
belong 
to 
President 
Trump, and he has, through his counsel, an-
nounced his intention to assert those execu-
tive privileges enumerated above, we must 
accept his direction and honor his invocation 
of executive privilege. As such, until these 
issues are resolved, we are unable to respond 
to your request for documents and testi-
mony. 
We will comply with the directions of the 
courts, when and if they rule on these claims 
of both executive and attorney client privi-
leges. Since these privileges belong to Presi-
dent Trump and not to Mr. Bannon, until 
these issues are resolved, Mr Bannon is le-
gally unable to comply with your subpoena 
requests for documents and testimony. 
Very truly yours, 
ROBERT J. COSTELLO. 
Mr. TONOLLI. In sum and substance, the 
letter states that Mr. Bannon is, ‘‘legally un-
able to comply with your subpoena requests 
for documents and testimony,’’ because 
President Trump’s attorney informed Mr. 
Costello by letter, dated October 6, 2021, that 
President Trump is invoking executive privi-
lege, ‘‘to the fullest extent permitted by 
law,’’ and instructing Mr. Bannon not to pro-
vide documents or testimony, ‘‘concerning 
privileged material,’’ in response to the Se-
lect Committee’s subpoena. 
I will mark as exhibit 4 and enter into the 
record a letter that Chairman THOMPSON 
sent to Mr. Costello in response on October 8, 
2021. 
SELECT COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE 
THE JANUARY 6TH ATTACK ON THE 
UNITED STAES CAPITOL, 
October 8, 2021. 
Mr. Robert J. Costello, 
Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP 
* * * 
DEAR MR. COSTELLO, I write in response to 
your October 7, 2021 letter which states that 
your client, Stephen Bannon, is ‘‘legally un-
able to comply’’ with the September 23, 2021 
subpoena (the ‘‘Subpoena’’) issued by the Se-
lect Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Capitol (the 
‘‘Select Committee’’). Your letter relies on 
an apparent instruction from former Presi-
dent Donald Trump that appears limited to 
requesting that Mr. Bannon not disclose 
privileged information. Despite this limited 
instruction, your letter takes the inappro-
priate position that Mr. Bannon will not 
comply with any request for information or 
testimony sought by the Select Committee. 
Moreover, Mr. Trump’s stated ‘‘intention to 
assert those executive privileges’’ that may 
or may not belong to him, does not provide 
a legal basis for Mr. Bannon’s refusal to com-
ply with the Subpoena. 
You accepted service of the Subpoena for 
documents and testimony on Mr. Bannon’s 
behalf on September 24, 2021. The Subpoena 
required that, by October 7, 2021 at 10:00 a.m., 
Mr. Bannon produce certain documents and

other records referring or relating to the 
matters described in the Subpoena’s sched-
ule. All the requested documents relate di-
rectly to the inquiry being conducted by the 
Select Committee, serve a legitimate legisla-
tive purpose, and are within the scope of the 
authority expressly delegated to the Select 
Committee pursuant to House Resolution 
503. In the letter accompanying the Sub-
poena, the Select Committee set forth the 
basis for its determination that the docu-
ments and records sought by the Subpoena 
and Mr. Bannon’s deposition testimony are 
of critical importance to the issues being in-
vestigated by the Select Committee. 
Your letter indicates that the sole basis for 
defiance of the Subpoena is Mr. Trump’s ‘‘di-
rection’’ to your client and his decision to 
‘‘honor [Mr. Trump’s] invocation of execu-
tive privilege.’’ That position has no basis in 
law, and your letter does not cite any stat-
ute, case law, or other legal precedent for 
support. 
First, virtually all the documents and testi-
mony sought by the Subpoena concern Mr. 
Bannon’s actions as a private citizen and in-
volve a broad range of subjects that are not 
covered by executive privilege. You have 
provided no basis for Mr. Bannon’s refusal to 
comply with those portions of the Subpoena 
not covered by any privilege. Furthermore, 
blanket assertions of the deliberative proc-
ess and attorney-client privileges, such as 
those apparently requested by Mr. Trump, 
have 
been 
rejected 
by 
courts 
as 
‘‘unsustainable’’ even when—unlike the situ-
ation with Mr. Bannon—the subpoena recipi-
ent is an Executive Branch agency. See 
Comm. on Oversight and Gov’t Reform v. Hold-
er, 2014 WL 2662665, at *2 (D.D.C. 2014) (reject-
ing DOJ’s assertion of deliberative process 
privilege on all documents after a particular 
date and noting that the ‘‘Attorney General 
has not cited any authority that would jus-
tify this sort of blanket approach’’). 
Second, the Select Committee has not re-
ceived any assertion, formal or otherwise, of 
any privilege from the Mr. Trump. Even as-
suming that, as a former President, Mr. 
Trump is permitted to formally invoke exec-
utive privilege, he has not done so. At most, 
Mr. Trump has ‘‘announced his intention to 
assert those executive privileges.’’ The Se-
lect Committee is not aware of any legal au-
thority, and your letter cites none, holding 
that the mere intention to assert a privilege 
absolves a subpoena recipient of his duty to 
comply. 
Third, your letter indicates that Mr. 
Trump has requested that your client ‘‘to 
the fullest extent permitted by law . . . not 
provide any testimony concerning privileged 
material in response to the Subpoena.’’ Even 
if your client had been a senior aide to the 
President during the time period covered by 
the contemplated testimony, which he was 
most assuredly not, he is not permitted by 
law to the type of immunity you suggest 
that Mr. Trump has requested he assert. To 
the contrary, every court that has consid-
ered the absolute immunity Mr. Trump al-
ludes to has rejected it. See, e.g., Harlow v. 
Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982); Comm. on the Ju-
diciary v. Miers, 558 F. Supp. 2d 53, 106 (D.D.C. 
2008) (rejecting former White House counsel’s 
assertion of absolute immunity from com-
pelled congressional process). Miers made 
clear that even the most senior Presidential 
advisors may not resist a congressional sub-
poena ‘‘based solely on their proximity to 
the President. ‘‘ Id. at 101 (citing Harlow, 457 
U.S. at 810).’ If there is no absolute immu-
nity for senior Presidential advisors, then 
there certainly can be no such immunity for 
private citizens, such as Mr. Bannon, who oc-
casionally communicate with the President 
on nonofficial, non-governmental, or cam-
paign-related matters. 
Regardless of any purported privilege as-
sertion by Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon has an on-
going obligation to produce documents to 
the Select Committee. Accordingly, please 
produce 
all 
responsive 
documents 
and 
records identified in the Subpoena. Should 
Mr. Bannon seek to withhold specific respon-
sive documents, consistent with the Sub-
poena instructions, he must provide the Se-
lect Committee with a privilege log that 
‘‘identifies and describes the material in a 
manner ‘sufficient to enable resolution of 
any privilege claims.’’’ See Comm. on Over-
sight, 2014 WL 12662665 at *2 (quoting Miers, 
558 F. Supp. 2d at 107). Such a privilege log 
should, at a minimum, provide the author(s) 
and recipient(s), indicate the general subject 
matter of each document being withheld, and 
the specific basis for withholding it. 
Finally, the Select Committee expects Mr. 
Bannon’s appearance at the time and place 
designated in the Subpoena for a deposition 
and respond fully to questions by the Select 
Committee. If there are specific questions at 
that deposition that you believe raise privi-
lege issues, Mr. Bannon should state them at 
that time for the deposition record for the 
Select Committee’s consideration and pos-
sible judicial review. 
Please be advised that the Select Com-
mittee will view Mr. Bannon’s failure to re-
spond to the Subpoena as willful non-compli-
ance with the Subpoena. His willful non- 
compliance with the Subpoena would force 
the Select Committee to consider invoking 
the contempt of Congress procedures in 2 
U.S.C. §§192, 194—which could result in a re-
ferral from the House to the Department of 
Justice for criminal charges—as well as the 
possibility of having a civil action to enforce 
the Subpoena brought against Mr. Bannon in 
his personal capacity. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman.

1 It is also worth noting that the court in Miers re-
jected the former White House Counsel’s claim of 
absolute immunity from congressional testimony 
even though the sitting President had formally in-
voked executive privilege. Id. at 62. 
Mr. TONOLLI. And I’ll take a brief pause 
to recognize that Mr. SCHIFF has joined us. 
Turning back to the letter that Chairman 
THOMPSON sent on October 8th, in sum and 
substance, the response states that Mr. 
Costello’s, ‘‘letter relies on an apparent in-
struction from former President Donald 
Trump that appears limited to requesting 
that Mr. Bannon not disclose privileged in-
formation. Despite this limited instruction, 
your letter takes the inappropriate position 
that Mr. Bannon will not comply with any 
request for information or testimony sought 
by the Select Committee. Moreover, Mr. 
Trump’s stated ‘intention to assert those ex-
ecutive privileges’ that may or may not be-
long to him does not provide a legal basis for 
Mr. Bannon’s refusal to comply with the sub-
poena.’’ 
The letter states the Select Committee’s 
expectation that Mr. Bannon would appear 
today for the deposition and respond fully to 
the Select Committee’s questions and to 
state for the record any objections to par-
ticular questions for the Select Committee’s 
consideration and possible judicial review. 
The letter concludes by advising that the 
Select Committee will view Mr. Bannon’s 
failure to respond to the subpoena as, ‘‘will-
ful noncompliance,’’ that would force the Se-
lect Committee to consider invoking the 
contempt of Congress procedures entitled to 
United States Code, sections 192 and 194, 
which could result in a referral from the 
House to the Department of Justice for 
criminal charges as well as the possibility of 
a civil action against Mr. Bannon personally 
to enforce the subpoena. 
I will mark as a final exhibit, exhibit 5, 
and enter into the record a reply letter that 
Mr. Costello sent to Chairman THOMPSON, 
the evening of October 13, 2021.

Re: The Subpoena for Stephen K. Bannon 
dated September 23, 2021 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN THOMPSON: I write on 
behalf of Stephen K. Bannon to respond to 
some of the inaccurate statements made in 
your letter to me dated October 8, 2021, 
which purports to address the positions 
taken by Mr. Bannon with respect to the 
above-referenced subpoena. 
As an initial matter, your use of the word 
‘‘defiance’’ is inappropriate. Mr. Bannon’s 
position is not in defiance of your Commit-
tee’s subpoena; rather, Mr. Bannon noted 
that President Trump’s counsel stated that 
they were invoking executive and other 
privileges and therefore directed us not to 
produce documents or give testimony that 
might reveal information President Trump’s 
counsel seeks to legally protect. Mr. Bannon 
has testified on three prior occasions, before 
the Mueller Investigation, the House Intel-
ligence Committee and the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee. In each of those in-
stances, when President Trump waived his 
invocation of the executive privileges, Mr. 
Bannon testified. 
As recently as today, counsel for President 
Trump, Justin Clark Esq., informed us that 
President Trump is exercising his executive 
privilege; therefore, he has directed Mr. 
Bannon not to produce documents or testify 
until the issue of executive privilege is re-
solved. Your Committee will have the right 
to challenge that exercise or its scope. That 
is an issue between the Committee and 
President Trump’s counsel and Mr. Bannon 
is not required to respond at this time. See 
Comm. on the Judiciary v. McGahn, 415 F. 
Supp. 3d 148, FN 34 (D.D.C. 2019) (‘‘The Presi-
dent can certainly identify sensitive infor-
mation that he deems subject to executive 
privilege, and his doing so gives rise to a 
legal duty on the part of the aide to invoke 
the privilege on the President’s behalf when, 
in the course of his testimony, he is asked a 
question that would require disclosure of 
that information.’’) 
Until such time as you reach an agreement 
with President Trump or receive a court rul-
ing as to the extent, scope and application of 
the executive privilege, in order to preserve 
the claim of executive and other privileges, 
Mr. Bannon will not be producing documents 
or testifying. As noted previously, Mr. 
Bannon will revisit his position if President 
Trump’s position changes or if a court rules 
on this matter. 
Mr. Bannon’s communications with Presi-
dent Trump on the matters at issue in the 
Subpoena are well within the scope of both 
the presidential communications and delib-
erative process executive privileges. See In 
re Sealed Case (Espy), 121 F.3d 729 (D.C. Cir. 
1997) (holding that the presidential commu-
nications privilege covers communications 
made or received by presidential advisors in 
the course of preparing advice for the Presi-
dent even if those communications are not 
made directly to the President); Coastal 
States Gas Corp. V. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 617 
F.2d 854, 868 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (finding that de-
liberative process privilege applies to ‘‘rec-
ommendations, draft documents, proposals, 
suggestions, and other subjective documents

October 21, 2021 
which reflect the personal opinions of the 
writer rather than the policy of the agen-
cy.’’) 
Very truly yours, 
ROBERT J. COSTELLO. 
Mr. TONOLLI. In sum and substance, the 
letter reiterates that Mr. Bannon is abiding 
by President Trump’s invocation of execu-
tive privilege and direction to Mr. Bannon 
not to produce documents or testify. 
In support of Mr. Bannon’s position, the 
letter cites several judicial opinions on exec-
utive privilege, including a 2019 decision of 
the United States District Court in Wash-
ington in the case of Committee on the Judici-
ary v. McGahn. 
In particular, the letter cites the following 
sentence from the court’s opinion: ‘‘The 
President can certainly identify sensitive in-
formation that he deems subject to executive 
privilege, and his doing so gives rise to a 
legal duty on the part of the aide to invoke 
the privilege on the President’s behalf when, 
in the course of his testimony, he is asked a 
question that would require disclosure of 
that information.’’ 
However, Mr. Bannon is not here today to 
assert executive privilege on a question-by- 
question basis. He chose instead not to ap-
pear at all, just as he chose not to produce 
any documents at all or even a log of respon-
sive documents that he is withholding based 
on the claim of executive privilege. 
With that, I will note for the record that it 
is 10:06 a.m., and Mr. Bannon still has not ap-
peared or communicated to the Select Com-
mittee that he will appear today as required 
by the subpoena. 
Accordingly, the record is now closed as of 
10:06 a.m. 
[Whereupon, at 10:06 a.m., the deposition 
was concluded.] 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, by direction of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol, I call up the resolution 
(H. Res. 730) recommending that the 
House of Representatives find Stephen 
K. Bannon in contempt of Congress for 
refusal to comply with a subpoena duly 
issued by the Select Committee to In-
vestigate the January 6th Attack on 
the United States Capitol, and ask for 
its immediate consideration 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 727, the resolu-
tion is considered read. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 730 
Resolved, That Stephen K. Bannon shall be 
found to be in contempt of Congress for fail-
ure to comply with a congressional sub-
poena. 
Resolved, That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 
and 194, the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives shall certify the report of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, 
detailing the refusal of Stephen K. Bannon 
to produce documents or appear for a deposi-
tion before the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol as directed by subpoena, to 
the United States Attorney for the District 
of Columbia, to the end that Mr. Bannon be 
proceeded against in the manner and form 
provided by law. 
Resolved, That the Speaker of the House 
shall otherwise take all appropriate action 
to enforce the subpoena. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
THOMPSON), the gentlewoman from Wy-
oming (Ms. CHENEY), and an opponent, 
or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON), the gentlewoman from Wy-
oming (Ms. CHENEY), and the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Mississippi. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days within which to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
since 
Speaker 
PELOSI asked me to chair the January 
6th Select Committee, I have spent a 
lot of time thinking about the impor-
tance of what we are doing, the weight 
of it, the urgency. We need to give the 
American people answers about what 
happened. There needs to be swift ac-
countability. But there are longer-term 
considerations, too. 
Madam Speaker, I am a grandfather, 
and when I talk to my grandkids about 
that horrific attack on our democracy 
on January 6, my mind jumps ahead to 
the future in store for them—questions 
about whether American democracy, as 
we know it now, will remain strong, 
whether it will withstand future tests. 
That has to be the legacy of this 
committee’s work. To be sure, we are 
going to answer questions about what 
happened on that day. But we also need 
to draw a roadmap for making sure our 
democracy remains strong tomorrow. 
We will look backward at what hap-
pened and try to explain how and why 
the insurrection came about. But we 
will also look forward and generate 
recommendations for legislative policy 
and process changes that will help en-
sure that nothing like this ever hap-
pens again. 
When we get to the end of this proc-
ess and look back, we are going to ask 
ourselves: Did we do everything in our 
power to uncover every fact? Did we 
use the tools at our disposal to get a 
full accounting, or did we let someone 
stand in our way without facing con-
sequences? Did we learn what we need-
ed to know for Congress to forge legis-
lation to help ensure we never experi-
ence another January 6 again? 
That is why we are taking up this 
resolution today, citing Steve Bannon 
with criminal contempt and referring 
him for prosecution by the Justice De-
partment. 
We didn’t choose to be here. This 
isn’t about punishing Steve Bannon. 
The select committee would prefer and, 
frankly, expect all witnesses to fully 
cooperate. But Steve Bannon has led us 
down this path by refusing to cooper-
ate in any way with our investigation. 
We believe Mr. Bannon has informa-
tion valuable to our probe. He was 
deeply involved in the so-called stop 
the steal campaign. He was reportedly 
in a war room meeting the day before 
the riot and had been pressuring the 
former President to try to stop the 
counting of the electoral college bal-
lots. 
He himself warned that ‘‘all hell’’ 
would break loose on January 6. We be-
lieve he can help inform our inquiry as 
to how the riot came together and 
what it was intended to achieve. He is 
clearly an important witness. 
We subpoenaed him. And unlike 
other witnesses who have engaged and 
worked with our team to find a way to 
cooperate, Mr. Bannon told us he 
wouldn’t comply because the former 
President told him not to. He hid be-
hind vague and baseless claims of privi-
lege. That is just not acceptable. 
The 
select 
committee 
told 
Mr. 
Bannon several times that he would 
face the consequences if he didn’t 
change course. Well, he didn’t change 
course, and his actions have brought us 
to this point. 
Madam Speaker, we need to make it 
clear that no person is above the law. 
We need to take a stand for the integ-
rity of the select committee’s inves-
tigation and for the integrity of this 
body. 
What sort of precedent would it set 
for the House of Representatives if we 
allow a witness to ignore us flat out 
without 
facing 
any 
kind 
of 
con-
sequences? What message would it send 
to other witnesses in our investiga-
tion? 
I am not willing to find out. I am not 
willing to get to the end of the select 
committee’s work and look back wish-
ing we had done more to uncover all 
the facts, not when we know what is on 
the line, when we know that our de-
mocracy isn’t yet out of danger, when 
we know that the forces that tried to 
overturn the election persist in their 
assault on the rule of law. 
Our investigation is going forward. 
We are hearing from witnesses, review-
ing documents, and analyzing data. Mr. 
Bannon stands alone in his defiance, 
and we will not stand for it. We will 
not allow anyone to derail our work be-
cause our work is too important: help-
ing ensure that the future of American 
democracy is strong and secure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, a year ago today, 
the election was still a couple of weeks 
off. We knew it would be a tight race. 
Most of us did not anticipate that 
President Trump, or any President, 
frankly, would ever simply reject the 
outcome of the vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5759 
October 21, 2021 
President Trump had the right to 
challenge the outcome in our State and 
Federal courts, which have an appro-
priate and constitutional role in re-
solving election claims. But what he 
did thereafter has no precedent in our 
history. He rejected the courts’ rulings 
in dozens of cases, including the rul-
ings of judges President Trump himself 
appointed. 
He rejected what his own Department 
of Justice officials told him over and 
over again, that they found no evidence 
of widespread fraud sufficient to over-
come the election. He rejected the con-
clusions of both the Department of 
Justice and the intelligence commu-
nity that the Dominion Voting ma-
chines had not secretly changed the 
election outcome. 
President Trump had no factual or 
constitutional basis for his claims. And 
the lawyers he found who would carry 
his false claims forward have paid the 
consequences. Rudy Giuliani’s license 
to practice law has been suspended, and 
Sidney Powell has been sanctioned by a 
Federal judge. 
But Donald Trump persisted, at-
tempting through every manner he 
could imagine to try to overturn the 
outcome of the election. We all saw 
what happened. The people who at-
tacked this building have told us on 
video, on social media, and now before 
the Federal courts exactly what moti-
vated them. They believed what Donald 
Trump told them, that the election was 
stolen and that they needed to take ac-
tion. 
Today, Madam Speaker, we are here 
to address one witness, Mr. Steve 
Bannon. I urge all Americans to watch 
what Mr. Bannon said on his podcast 
on January 5 and 6. It is shocking and 
indefensible. He said, ‘‘All hell is going 
to break loose.’’ He said, ‘‘We are com-
ing in right over the target. This is the 
point of attack we have always want-
ed.’’ 
Madam Speaker, there are people in 
this Chamber right now who were evac-
uated with me and with the rest of us 
on that day during that attack; people 
who now seem to have forgotten the 
danger of the moment, the assault on 
the Constitution, the assault on our 
Congress; people who you will hear 
argue that there is simply no legisla-
tive purpose for this committee, for 
this investigation, or for this subpoena. 
In fact, there is no doubt that Mr. 
Bannon knows far more than what he 
said on the video. There is no doubt 
that all hell did break loose. Just ask 
the scores of brave police officers who 
were injured that day protecting all of 
us. The American people deserve to 
hear his testimony. 
Let me give you just four examples of 
the legislative purpose of this inves-
tigation. 
First, the plot we are investigating, 
involving Mr. Eastman, Mr. Giuliani, 
Mr. Bannon, President Trump, and 
many others, their plot attempted to 
halt or delay our count of electoral 
votes and reverse the outcome of the 
2020 election. The 1887 Electoral Count 
Act is directly at issue, and our inves-
tigation will lead to recommendations 
to amend or reform that act. 
b 1445 
Second, while the attack was under-
way, President Trump knew it was 
happening; indeed, he may have been 
watching it all unfold on television, 
and yet he took no immediate action 
to stop it. This appears to be a supreme 
dereliction 
of 
duty 
by 
President 
Trump, and we are evaluating whether 
our criminal laws should be enhanced 
to supply additional and more severe 
consequences for this type of behavior. 
Third, we know from our investiga-
tion to date that President Trump was 
pressuring the Department of Justice 
in late December 2020 to support his 
false claims that the election was sto-
len. 
Several 
brave 
and 
honorable 
Trump appointees at the department 
flatly refused to go along with this 
fraud and threatened to resign. We are 
evaluating what, if any, additional 
laws may be required to prevent a fu-
ture President from succeeding in such 
an effort. 
Fourth, we know that President 
Trump made efforts to persuade State 
election officials to ‘‘find votes’’ to 
change the election outcome in his 
favor. We are evaluating whether the 
criminal laws of the United States 
should be enhanced to make the pen-
alty for this type of behavior even 
more severe, and, if so, in what man-
ner. 
Mr. Bannon’s own public statements 
made clear he knew what was going to 
happen before it did, and thus he must 
have been aware of and may well have 
been involved in the planning of every-
thing that played out on that day. 
The American people deserve to 
know what he knew and what he did. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, 3 months ago, for 
the first time in the history of Con-
gress, Speaker PELOSI vetoed JIM JOR-
DAN and me from serving on the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Cap-
itol. 
Not all firsts are worth celebrating. 
It was a shameful and divisive decision 
with real consequences. Today, because 
of that decision, there is no committee 
conducting a legitimate investigation 
into January 6. Congress is prohibited 
from conducting criminal investiga-
tions, period. 
But that is exactly what the select 
committee is doing, conducting an il-
licit, criminal investigation into Amer-
ican citizens. Steve Bannon was a pri-
vate citizen before, after, and during 
January 6. 
So why is the select committee inter-
ested in Steve Bannon? 
It is simple. He is a Democratic 
Party bogeyman. The select committee 
despises Steve Bannon’s politics, so 
they are abusing their power to put 
him in jail. 
The committee explained it is seek-
ing documents from Mr. Bannon be-
cause he helped ‘‘construct and partici-
pated in’’ the permitted and legal Stop 
the Steal rally. 
To date, the select committee has 
subpoenaed 11 other private citizens for 
organizing the Stop the Steal rally. 
Here, in the land of the free, 12 Amer-
ican citizens are under congressional 
investigation for the sole crime of 
planning 
a 
legal 
political 
protest. 
Never in the history of Congress has a 
committee or a political party stooped 
so low. 
Congress has no authority to conduct 
criminal investigations. Congress can 
only issue subpoenas to serve a legisla-
tive purpose. 
The question that the committee 
must answer is: Why are they seeking 
information about a permitted polit-
ical rally? 
What legislative purpose does that 
serve? 
Is the committee considering laws to 
limit Americans’ right to political pro-
test? 
It is clear that the select committee 
doesn’t give a lick about Congress’ sub-
poena authority. 
Does the committee share the same 
disdain for the First Amendment? 
I wouldn’t put it past them. As we all 
know, the Department of Justice has a 
highly active criminal investigation 
into the January 6 attack. They have 
made something like 600 arrests—as I 
said, very active, even hyperactive, 
compared to the Biden Department of 
Justice’s typical reaction to political 
violence. But the Department of Jus-
tice’s investigation isn’t comprehen-
sive. 
There are still questions that only 
Congress can answer. Congress still has 
a role to play, but the select com-
mittee has completely abandoned that 
role. 
Why else does the select committee 
want to hear from Mr. Bannon? 
Because on January 5, Mr. Bannon 
warned that ‘‘all hell was going to 
break loose tomorrow.’’ 
So according to the select com-
mittee, no person could have predicted 
that violence might occur that day. 
According to the committee, that be-
cause Mr. Bannon warned of violence 
on the 5th is proof that Mr. Bannon had 
‘‘foreknowledge’’ of the attack on the 
6th. 
Never mind that the FBI found that 
the attack wasn’t coordinated. Never 
mind that the Capitol Police received 
actionable intelligence about potential 
violence occurring weeks before the 
6th. Never mind that every Member of 
Congress, every single D.C. resident, 
and every American with internet ac-
cess knew that violence was a possi-
bility on January 6. 
The question the committee should 
be asking is this: How did the United 
States Capitol Police, the D.C. Metro-
politan Police, and the FBI all have no

clue that ‘‘all hell was going to break 
loose?’’ 
Steve Bannon, a private citizen, 
knew. 
So why didn’t the Capitol Police have 
enough riot shields? 
Why did it take multiple hours to de-
ploy the National Guard? 
These are worthwhile questions, and 
Congress has a duty to answer them be-
cause January 6 was an enormous in-
telligence failure. There was a break-
down in security, a breakdown that 
was repeated on Good Friday when Of-
ficer Billy Evans was brutally mur-
dered. 
The issues that plagued the Capitol 
Police on January 6 have not been 
fixed. In fact, according to a Capitol 
Police whistleblower, the officers most 
responsible for the intelligence failure 
on the 6th were promoted by Speaker 
PELOSI’s team. 
To be clear, the select committee is 
engaged in an unconstitutional, polit-
ical investigation. It is a sham inves-
tigation conducted by a sham com-
mittee that refuses to answer real 
questions about what happened on Jan-
uary 6. 
The Capitol was attacked, and in-
stead of figuring out what went wrong, 
the committee launched its own attack 
on Congress’ norms. 
The 
Select 
Committee’s 
politicization of January 6 cuts both 
ways. The committee’s inaction has 
made the Capitol less secure, and the 
committee’s actions have further sepa-
rated Congress from its constitutional 
role. 
The American people and the United 
States Capitol Police deserve a real in-
vestigation into the 6th, and the select 
committee has abandoned them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to make the moral vote. Do the 
right thing. I urge Members to vote for 
the rule of law, for the institution of 
Congress, and against the select com-
mittee’s dangerous abuse of Congress’ 
oversight authority. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I heard the gentleman 
opposing this resolution. We are not 
actually seeking information from Mr. 
Bannon because of his opinions. We 
issued the subpoena because we believe 
he has knowledge of relevant facts that 
we need to discover. We are not vio-
lating anything and, certainly, not Mr. 
Bannon’s First Amendment rights. The 
only violation we can talk about is the 
violation of this building on January 6, 
and Mr. Bannon’s claim that the elec-
tion was stolen helped foment that at-
tack. Investigating that is also part of 
our charter. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I wanted to correct 
the RECORD. The gentleman from Indi-
ana asserted that the FBI has found 
there was no coordination. That is just 
simply not true. 
The gentleman also said that he is 
not on the committee. He noted that 
the Speaker had determined that he 
wouldn’t be on the committee. 
Madam Speaker, I have a number of 
letters the gentleman from Indiana has 
been sending to Federal agencies, and I 
include in the RECORD one dated Sep-
tember 16, 2021, for example, signing 
his name as the ranking member of the 
committee he has just informed the 
House he is not on and that, in fact, he 
is not on. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, September 16, 2021. 
Hon. DEB HAALAND, 
Secretary, Department of the Interior, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SECRETARY HAALAND: You are receiv-
ing this letter because the House of Rep-
resentatives Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the events of January 6th may have 
sent you a request for information. The 
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy 
appointed me to serve as the Ranking Mem-
ber of the Select Committee. Yet, House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to allow me to 
fulfill my duties as Ranking Member. 
Pursuant to the rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the minority party in Congress 
retains rights to the same information that 
is provided to the majority party. For those 
reasons, I ask that you provide me any infor-
mation that is submitted to the Select Com-
mittee. Additionally, please include me on 
any update or briefing that you provide. If 
you have questions, please do not hesitate to 
contact my staff. 
Sincerely, 
JIM BANKS, 
Ranking Member. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
would note that the gentleman from 
Indiana is incorrect. We are not pur-
suing a law enforcement investigation. 
Only the DOJ can do that. 
What we are doing is taking the steps 
that are provided for under the con-
gressional contempt statute that has 
existed for many decades because the 
select committee’s charge is to get to 
the bottom of what happened on Janu-
ary 6, who planned it, who paid for it, 
what was the intent, and what legisla-
tive steps can we recommend to re-
move future threats to our Constitu-
tion. 
To do that, we need information, 
both documents and testimony; and to 
get that we issue subpoenas. 
Now what is a subpoena? 
Is it just a suggestion, a mere re-
quest, an encouragement to testify? 
No. A subpoena is a writ issued by a 
government agency, in this case the 
Congress, to compel testimony or pro-
duction of evidence. When you get a 
subpoena, Madam Speaker, the law re-
quires you to comply. If you think 
there may be some valid reason that 
excuses you from telling the truth 
under oath, then you have to come in 
and make your case to the committee. 
Steve Bannon is the only person who 
has outright refused to engage with the 
committee. He thinks that if he simply 
obstructs Congress by not showing up 
he will escape the consequences. But as 
Theodore Roosevelt said, ‘‘No man is 
above the law and no man is below the 
law.’’ 
If you get a subpoena, you cannot 
hide behind vague and immaterial 
claims of privilege. 
The cases make it clear—Judicial 
Watch, Nixon v. GSA, and the McGahn 
case—executive privilege is limited to 
immediate White House advisers on 
government policy. Bannon is a private 
citizen. His extravagant claims can’t 
shield his conversations and plotting 
with other private citizens. His status, 
according to the cases, doesn’t get ex-
ecutive privilege protection. He has no 
absolute immunity. 
Madam Speaker, what would happen 
if an American received a subpoena 
from Congress or a court? 
Do you think they could get away 
with just saying: Go fly a kite? They 
would be held accountable. 
And so should Mr. Bannon be held to 
account for defying the law regarding 
this subpoena. 
Madam Speaker, to defend the rule of 
law, we must vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, no one has said that 
the select committee doesn’t have a 
legislative purpose. 
Let’s be very clear. There is impor-
tant work that, frankly, we wish they 
were doing; like answering, why was 
this campus left unprotected? And 
what are we doing to keep it from hap-
pening again? That hasn’t happened 
yet. 
What we are saying is that the sub-
poenas that have so far been issued do 
not ask for information that would 
meet any legitimate legislative pur-
pose. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from the great State of Illinois (Mr. 
RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and 
colleague from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) for 
yielding. 
I can tell you, when I got elected to 
serve in this body almost 9 years ago, I 
didn’t expect to be standing here today 
to talk about such an important issue. 
I spent 16 years as a congressional 
staffer working for a Member of Con-
gress whom I looked up to and who re-
spected this institution for what it was 
and what it meant to our country. 
When I came to Congress to serve 
with him, I had the utmost respect for 
this institution at the same time. That 
is why I wanted to be part of the House 
Administration Committee because I 
wanted to make this Congress and this 
House work better, act in a much more 
bipartisan manner, and make sure that 
we protect those who run this campus, 
but also at the same time protect those 
who protect us. 
Madam Speaker, we are now months 
and months in, months and months

October 21, 2021 
post January 6. From my many con-
versations with U.S. Capitol Police of-
ficers and those who work on this cam-
pus, they have the same concerns I 
have. 
The question they ask is: Why were 
we so unprotected on January 6? And 
what has changed since then? 
b 1500 
Getting to the bottom of those ques-
tions should be the top priority for all 
of us in this House. There are serious 
security vulnerabilities that have not 
been addressed by this House in nearly 
11 months after January 6. And this is 
what the majority has decided to spend 
its time on, holding a private citizen, 
who wasn’t even part of the adminis-
tration at the time, in contempt for re-
fusing to comply with House Demo-
crats’ subpoenas. This is after more 
than 600 people have been arrested for 
their role in the tragedies we saw on 
January 6. 
When I get the article, I will submit 
for the RECORD, Madam Speaker, a 
Reuters article that talks about senior 
officials stating at the FBI that there 
was no organized effort to overthrow 
the government on January 6. So I will 
submit it once I get a copy of that. I 
did not bring it with me. 
But our job, again, is to secure this 
Capitol. We have never seen a breach 
like the one that we saw that day. And 
it is our responsibility to make sure it 
doesn’t happen again. 
But that hasn’t been done under the 
leadership of this House. We have had 
two independent reports regarding Jan-
uary 6, one bipartisan report in the 
Senate and another one commissioned 
by the Speaker herself, and that came 
out in March. These have never been 
acted on. But this is what the select 
committee has been working on? 
The Capitol Police IG has released 
seven reports related to January 6, 
making recommendations on what is 
needed to secure this Capitol. To my 
disappointment, the majority has not 
acted in a meaningful way to ensure 
that all 103 IG findings are imple-
mented. 
These reports have all told us what 
the problems are and the recommenda-
tions on how to fix them. But Congress, 
us, have failed to even debate these 
changes, let alone act on them. 
We know massive changes to intel, 
perimeter protection training, leader-
ship structure, decisionmaking proc-
esses, and many, many more are need-
ed, but neither the select committee, 
nor the Committee on House Adminis-
tration, seem at all interested in ensur-
ing these changes are made. 
The Committee on House Adminis-
tration, which has oversight of secu-
rity, hasn’t held a single hearing since 
August 5, with no upcoming hearings 
scheduled according to the majority’s 
website. 
The select committee, right now, as 
we see, is just purely focused on polit-
ical subpoenas. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the articles I previously men-
tioned. 
[From Reuters, Aug. 20, 2021] 
EXCLUSIVE: FBI FINDS SCANT EVIDENCE U.S. 
CAPITOL ATTACK WAS COORDINATED—SOURCES 
(By Mark Hosenball and Sarah N. Lynch) 
WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters).—The FBI 
has found scant evidence that the Jan. 6 at-
tack on the U.S. Capitol was the result of an 
organized plot to overturn the presidential 
election result, according to four current and 
former law enforcement officials. 
Though federal officials have arrested 
more than 570 alleged participants, the FBI 
at this point believes the violence was not 
centrally coordinated by far-right groups or 
prominent supports of then-President Donald 
Trump, according to the sources, who have 
been either directly involved in or briefed 
regularly on the wide-ranging investigations. 
‘‘Ninety to ninety-five percent of these are 
one-off cases,’’ said a former senior law en-
forcement official with knowledge of the in-
vestigation. ‘‘Then you have five percent, 
maybe, of these militia groups that were 
more closely organized. But there was no 
grand scheme with Roger Stone and Alex 
Jones and all of these people to storm the 
Capitol and take hostages.’’ 
Stone, a veteran Republican operative and 
self-described ‘‘dirty trickster’’, and Jones, 
founder of a conspiracy-driven radio show 
and webcast, are both allies of Trump and 
had been involved in pro-Trump events in 
Washington on Jan. 5, the day before the 
riot. 
FBI investigators did find that cells of pro-
testers, including followers of the far-right 
Oath Keepers and Proud Boys groups, had 
aimed to break into the Capitol. But they 
found no evidence that the groups had seri-
ous plans about what to do if they made it 
inside, the sources said. 
Prosecutors have filed conspiracy charges 
against 40 of those defendants, alleging that 
they engaged in some degree of planning be-
fore the attack. 
They alleged that one Proud Boy leader re-
cruited members and urged them to stock-
pile bulletproof vests and other military- 
style equipment in the weeks before the at-
tack and on Jan. 6 sent members forward 
with a plan to split into groups and make 
multiple entries to the Capitol. 
But so far prosecutors have steered clear of 
more serious, politically-loaded charges that 
the sources said had been initially discussed 
by prosecutors, such as seditious conspiracy 
or racketeering. 
The FBI’s assessment could prove relevant 
for a congressional investigation that also 
aims to determine how that day’s events 
were organized and by whom. 
Senior lawmakers have been briefed in de-
tail on the results of the FBI’s investigation 
so far and find them credible, a Democratic 
congressional source said. 
The chaos on Jan. 6 erupted as the U.S. 
Senate and House of Representatives met to 
certify Joe Biden’s victory in November’s 
presidential election. 
It was the most violent attack on the Cap-
itol since the War of 1812, forcing lawmakers 
and Trump’s own vice president, Mike Pence, 
to scramble for safety. 
Four people died and another died the fol-
lowing day, and more than 100 police officers 
were injured. 
TRUMP’S SPEECH 
Trump made an incendiary speech at a 
nearby rally shortly before the riot, repeat-
ing false claims that the 2020 election was 
stolen and urging supporters to march on the 
Capitol to pressure lawmakers to reject 
Biden’s victory. 
In public comments last month to the 
Democratic-led 
congressional 
committee 
formed to investigate the violence, police of-
ficers injured in the mayhem urged law-
makers to determine whether Trump helped 
instigate it. Some Democrats have said they 
want him to testify. 
But the FBI has so far found no evidence 
that he or people directly around him were 
involved in organizing the violence, accord-
ing to the four current and former law en-
forcement officials. 
More than 170 people have been charged so 
far with assaulting or impeding a police offi-
cer, according to the Justice Department. 
That carries a maximum sentence of 20 
years. 
But one source said there has been little, if 
any, recent discussion by senior Justice De-
partment officials of filing charges such as 
‘‘seditious conspiracy’’ to accuse defendants 
of trying to overthrow the government. They 
have also opted not to bring racketeering 
charges, often used against organized crimi-
nal gangs. 
Senior officials had discussed filing such 
charges in the weeks after the attack, the 
sources said. 
Prosecutors have also not brought any 
charges alleging that any individual or group 
played a central role in organizing or leading 
the riot. Law-enforcement sources told Reu-
ters no such charges appeared to be pending. 
Conspiracy charges that have been filed al-
lege that defendants discussed their plans in 
the weeks before the attack and worked to-
gether on the day itself. But prosecutors 
have not alleged that this activity was part 
of a broader plot. 
Some federal judges and legal experts have 
questioned whether the Justice Department 
is letting defendants off too lightly. 
Judge Beryl Howell in July asked prosecu-
tors to explain why one defendant was al-
lowed to plead to a misdemeanor charge car-
rying a maximum sentence of six months, 
rather than a more serious felony charge. 
Spokespeople for the Justice Department 
and U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington, 
which is leading the Jan. 6 prosecutions, de-
clined to comment. 
The congressional committee investigating 
the attack will talk with the FBI and other 
agencies as part of its probe.

FBI FINDS NO EVIDENCE THAT TRUMP AND HIS 
ALLIES WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH OR-
GANIZING
THE
VIOLENCE
OF
THE
CAPITOL 
RIOT: REPORT 
(By Bryan Metzger) 
The FBI has found no evidence that Trump 
was directly involved in organizing Capitol- 
riot violence. 
It also found little evidence of an organized 
plot to overturn the election results. 
Ninety to ninety-five percent of these are 
one-off cases,’’ said one former official. 
See more stories on Insider’s business 
page. 
The FBI hasn’t found any evidence that 
the January 6 assault on the US Capitol was 
part of an organized plot to overturn the 
election results, Reuters reported, citing 
law-enforcement officials. 
The officials also said that the FBI has ‘‘so 
far found no evidence’’ that former President 
Donald Trump or ‘‘people directly around 
him were involved in organizing the vio-
lence,’’ Reuters reported. 
‘‘Ninety to ninety-five percent of these are

and Proud Boys did plan ahead of time to 
break into the Capitol, but they didn’t en-
gage in much planning beyond that step. 
Reuters reported that 40 percent of the de-
fendants are being prosecuted on conspiracy 
charges, implying a certain amount of plan-
ning and coordination. 
But prosecutors have generally shied away 
from alleging a broader plot. Senior Depart-
ment of Justice officials do not intend to 
bring forward seditious-conspiracy charges 
or even racketeering charges, which are 
commonly used against organized criminal 
gangs. 
A Democratic congressional source told 
Reuters that senior lawmakers who have 
been briefed on the FBl’s investigation find 
the results credible. 
Though the FBI has not found an organized 
plot or direct involvement by Trump, that 
doesn’t mean that Trump didn’t play an im-
portant role in instigating the violence. Ear-
lier this year, the House of Representatives 
impeached Trump on the charge of ‘‘incite-
ment of insurrection’’ after he spent weeks 
promoting conspiracy theories about the re-
sults of the 2020 election. On January 6, 
Trump gave a speech on The Ellipse where he 
urged supporters to march on the Capitol. 
Read the original article on Business In-
sider. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Ad-
ditionally, a number of questions from 
that day still remain unanswered. I am 
still waiting for the Speaker of the 
House to answer a letter I sent her 
back in February that asked why the 
National Guard, requested by Police 
Chief Sund, were denied? And why was 
the Speaker’s office and the Speaker 
involved in eventually approving the 
request? Why has the House Sergeant 
at Arms refused to comply with preser-
vation and production requests from 
my office? 
We have many, many more questions 
about why the Capitol was so unpre-
pared that day. Our top priority should 
be ensuring our Capitol is never as vul-
nerable as it was on January 6, but this 
majority has done absolutely nothing 
to make the security changes needed to 
make this Capitol safer. 
Madam Speaker, we must do better. 
We have not fixed the institutional 
problems with our security apparatus 
that led to the lack of preparation, the 
danger that our brave officers were put 
in on that day and any other possible 
day like that in the future. That is a 
failure of leadership in this institution. 
We must fix the problems that led to 
the terrible security posture here—and 
I will tell you, after witnessing what 
we saw a few different days and secu-
rity postures that this House was put 
into a couple of other days since Janu-
ary 6—and I urge you to talk to the 
brave officers that stand around these 
buildings and protect all of us every 
day; ask them the same question I do. 
Ask them if we have put them in a bet-
ter position than they were in on Janu-
ary 6? And the answer out of every sin-
gle officer I asked that question to is 
‘‘no.’’ 
What is stopping this House from fix-
ing the problems? It is a lack of will. It 
is a lack of focusing on the true issues 
that led for them to be put in a dan-
gerous spot on January 6. Instead, we 
are talking politics. It is wrong, and we 
must do better. 
I have said this time and time again, 
I stand willing to work with my Demo-
crat colleagues to make this House, 
this Capitol, safer for everyone. In-
stead, it is all about political points 
like the one being scored today. 
I am disappointed. You can tell. My 
frustration is going to continue to boil 
over until we are in a position to fix 
the problems that I have laid out and 
that we know exist. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in response to the 
gentleman from Illinois’ statement, 
the first hearing of the select com-
mittee that we actually held inter-
viewed four officers who put their lives 
on the line defending all of us who 
work here in this body. So I assure you, 
my directions to the committee have 
always been, we will look at all of the 
facts and circumstances surrounding 
what occurred. 
We are genuinely interested in get-
ting to the facts. We are working to get 
the answers. And that is why we are on 
the floor today, to get answers from 
Steve Bannon about what he knew, 
what he did leading up to January 6. 
Also, to the gentleman from Indiana, 
I am glad he finally agrees that the se-
lect committee has a legitimate legis-
lative purpose and that is why we are 
here today, pursuing that legislative 
purpose. So I am happy that the 
RECORD will reflect his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
MURPHY), a valiant member of the se-
lect committee. 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of this reso-
lution to refer Stephen Bannon to the 
Department of Justice for prosecution 
for contempt of Congress. 
It didn’t have to be this way. Mr. 
Bannon, a self-professed patriot, could 
have done the patriotic thing and co-
operated with our bipartisan com-
mittee. 
If Mr. Bannon was proud of the role 
he played in connection with January 
6, he should be eager to tell his side of 
the story. Instead, he is acting like a 
man who has something to hide. Our 
committee seeks only the truth. That 
is our legal charge and our moral obli-
gation. We cannot let any individual 
impede our inquiry, and we will not 
tolerate Mr. Bannon’s evasion. 
Why must we be so unrelenting in 
our pursuit of truth? Because on Janu-
ary 6, the greatest Nation on Earth 
came under attack. And this attack 
wasn’t carried out by officials in Bei-
jing, Moscow, or Tehran, or by foreign 
terrorists even. It was an attack con-
ducted by our fellow citizens, regular 
Americans who were radicalized be-
cause they believed outrageous lies fed 
to them by other Americans in posi-
tions of power and influence. 
The attack was launched against the 
seat and symbol of our Republic. It was 
designed to disrupt the certification of 
the Presidential election results, to 
defy the will of the voters. This was no 
peaceful protest in a proud American 
tradition. It was violent and vicious. 
Members of the mob wielded weapons. 
They called for the death of the Vice 
President. They hunted Members of 
Congress. They caused severe harm to 
law enforcement officers. And the real 
disservice to the police comes from 
those who want to whitewash the vio-
lence of January 6 and pretend that the 
riot of that day was anything short of 
the violent attack it was, aimed at de-
railing the peaceful transfer of power. 
America is not just a place; it is an 
idea. And on January 6, there was an 
attack on the very idea of America. I 
believe that patriots of all political 
stripes should want to protect our Cap-
itol, this country, and her Constitu-
tion. Our committee will make a full 
accounting of what happened, and we 
will make recommendations to ensure 
it never happens again. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. AGUILAR). 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the vice chair for yielding. 
Like many of my colleagues, I was 
right here on the House floor when the 
violent mob attacked our Capitol. I 
saw those doors shaking, nearly over-
run with rioters attempting to enter. I 
saw my colleagues shed their jackets 
and roll up their sleeves preparing for 
the eventuality. And I saw Capitol Po-
lice acting quickly and thoughtfully to 
conduct a successful evacuation of 
Members from this Chamber. Their ac-
tions, undoubtedly, saved lives. 
What we didn’t know at the time was 
that on the steps of the Capitol, the 
Capitol Police and the Metro PD offi-
cers were engaged in brutal hand-to- 
hand combat. Officer Michael Fanone 
told us he was grabbed, beaten, and 
tased, all while being called a traitor 
to this country. 
This is what officers dealt with to de-
fend our democracy. Some lost their 
lives; many are still living with both 
the physical wounds and the trauma 
that they suffered that day. This is 
what our officers dealt with to defend 
democracy. 
Officer Harry Dunn told us more than 
6 months later, January 6 still isn’t 
over for me. These officers are heroes. 
I want to thank the chair and the vice 
chair for their leadership in making 
our first order of business hearing di-
rectly from those heroes in their own 
words. 
We wanted to hear and make sure 
that all of our colleagues and this 
country heard firsthand what we expe-
rienced on the ground that day. We 
asked them to explain the violence 
they had to endure to protect our 
democratic process, and in return, they 
made one simple request: to get to the 
bottom of this. 
They want answers, and, quite frank-
ly, they deserve answers. So far, both 
the Metro PD and the Capitol Police

have been excellent allies in this inves-
tigation. They have cooperated, shared 
their stories and expertise, and pro-
vided us with key evidence and ac-
counts of the violence they endured 
that day. And we owe it to them to see 
this investigation through. 
The vote we take today is a crucial 
step toward removing a roadblock in 
our investigation. We owe it to every 
officer who put their life on the line 
that day and every day to protect us 
here in the Capitol. We owe them an-
swers. And this committee intends to 
get to those answers by all means nec-
essary. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
KINZINGER), an Iraq and Afghanistan 
Air Force veteran and a lieutenant 
colonel in the Air National Guard. 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. Let 
me just say first, Madam Speaker, as a 
Republican, don’t let my side use the 
security posture as the straw-man ar-
gument in this. The reality is that that 
is the equivalent of blaming the victim 
of a crime for the crime. And while it 
is important, that is not what we are 
here to talk about today. 
Madam Speaker, voting on a crimi-
nal contempt resolution is not the po-
sition we had hoped to be in, but Steve 
Bannon went out of his way to earn 
this resolution before us and now we 
must approve it. 
Mr. Bannon’s willful disregard for the 
select 
committee’s 
subpoena 
dem-
onstrates his utter contempt for the 
American people’s right to know how 
the attacks on January 6 came about. 
He has advanced a ludicrous legal argu-
ment in support of his decision not to 
corroborate or comply, a decision that 
defies the rule of law and rejects the 
will of the American people. 
Mr. Bannon’s reported actions put 
him near the center of the investiga-
tion into the events surrounding Janu-
ary 6. His own words strongly suggest 
that the actions of the mob that 
stormed the Capitol and invaded this 
very Chamber came as no surprise to 
him. He and a few others were, by all 
accounts, involved in planning that 
day’s events, and encouraged those who 
attacked the Capitol, our officers, and 
our democracy. 
I have no doubt that Mr. Bannon’s 
scorn for our subpoena is real. But no 
one—and I repeat, no one—is above the 
law, and we need to hear from him. 
As the select committee’s contempt 
report states, it was Mr. Bannon who 
on January 5 predicted with chilling 
accuracy: ‘‘All hell is going to break 
loose tomorrow.’’ 
On his radio show that day he stated: 
‘‘It’s not going to happen like you 
think it’s going to happen. Okay. It’s 
going to be quite extraordinarily dif-
ferent. All I can say is, strap in. You 
made this happen and tomorrow it’s 
game day. So strap in. Let’s get 
ready.’’ 
And it was Mr. Bannon, who was re-
corded as saying: ‘‘It’s all converging, 
and now we’re on the point of attack 
tomorrow.’’ 
b 1515 
Mr. Bannon said these things pub-
licly, as a private citizen, someone 
deeply involved with the Stop the Steal 
movement, and he said them nearly 3 
years after leaving his job at the White 
House. 
Mr. 
Bannon 
was 
also 
reportedly 
among the small group of Trump con-
fidants assembled at the Willard Hotel 
to discuss plans to stop or delay the 
January 6 count. 
Is it any wonder that the select com-
mittee needs to hear from him; that we 
want to see related materials that he 
has? 
Furthermore, does anyone really be-
lieve Mr. Bannon’s actions are covered 
by a blanket, no-questions-asked claim 
of executive privilege? One the former 
President has never actually made. 
Madam Speaker, Steve Bannon is a 
key witness to the select committee’s 
probe. He has yet to say or produce 
anything in response to the subpoena. 
His assertion of executive privilege is 
farfetched in the extreme and not his 
to make. 
I urge my colleagues to join me to 
support the contempt resolution. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, today, 
Donald Trump said the insurrection 
took place on November 3. No, Mr. 
Trump. I am sorry. That is what we 
call an election in America; an election 
that was validated by more than 60 
Federal or State courts, including be-
fore eight judges nominated to the 
bench by President Trump himself, and 
all the way up to the United States Su-
preme Court, all of them rejecting 
every claim of electoral fraud and cor-
ruption that was advanced. 
We know an insurrection when we see 
one in this body, because we lived 
through one. Under the banner of this 
continuing and deranged big lie, the 
Stop the Steal movement brought 
down a violent insurrection against 
this Congress in an attempted coup 
against Vice President Mike Pence. 
They interrupted the counting of elec-
toral college votes for the first time in 
American history. They caused the 
worst attack on Congress since the War 
of 1812; and they injured and wounded 
more than 140 police officers, Capitol 
Police officers, Metropolitan Police De-
partment officers, and others, breaking 
their noses, breaking their necks, 
breaking 
their 
vertebrae, 
breaking 
their arms, breaking their legs, break-
ing their hearts and their spirits. 
We are investigating the attack on 
American democracy because we are 
Americans. We are investigating the 
attack on Congress by domestic en-
emies of our Constitution because we 
are sworn to do so by our oaths of of-
fice. 
But now, the big lie has become a big 
coverup. After being impeached twice 
by the House, after losing in 61 dif-
ferent courts, after seeing a 57–43 vote 
against him in the U.S. Senate, in the 
most sweeping bipartisan Senate Presi-
dential conviction vote in American 
history, Trump now tries to get his fol-
lowers, like Steve Bannon, not to tes-
tify here and not to turn over evidence 
that they have about this vicious as-
sault on American democracy. 
In America, when you are subpoenaed 
to testify in court or in Congress, you 
show up, period. You can invoke your 
Fifth Amendment privilege against 
self-incrimination to specific questions 
if you think you committed a crime. 
You can claim executive privilege to 
specific questions if you think you are 
President of the United States. But 
you cannot blow off a subpoena in 
America. You cannot sit on your couch 
and defy the people’s representatives in 
Congress. 
So we must enforce the rule of law 
here, my colleagues. We must do it. If 
you act deliberately, with sneering, 
cavalier contempt for the American 
people and their representatives, we 
will hold you in contempt. We will get 
to the truth of the violent assault on 
America. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, you don’t have to 
look far to realize the absurdity of 
what is happening in Congress today. 
In fact, Politico just reported moments 
ago that the Capitol Police whistle-
blower is telling us—telling Politico— 
that they have not been contacted by 
the January 6 select committee. 
The 
Capitol 
Police 
whistleblower 
said that the United States Capitol Po-
lice deserves more scrutiny than it has 
gotten so far and that he would talk to 
investigators if they reach out to him. 
And the select committee has not 
reached out to the Capitol Police whis-
tleblower. 
Yet, here we are today focused on 
holding a private citizen in contempt, 
an unprecedented action by this sham 
committee and their sham investiga-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
my 
colleague 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, why 
are we here on the floor of the House of 
Representatives listening to the Demo-
crats and socialists and their Repub-
lican puppets reviewing Steve Bannon’s 
podcast? 
I can’t imagine that that would be 
the case if they actually had a bill, a 
reconciliation deal, legislation to help 
the American people. We are not here 
because of democracy. Save me the al-
ligator tears on that. These are the 
folks who assaulted our democracy for 
2 years under the specter of the Russia 
hoax. It is sure not about violence, be-
cause they didn’t seem to give a damn

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5764 
October 21, 2021 
when our country was being engulfed 
in flames during the riots of the sum-
mer of 2020. 
It is not about Congressional process. 
If it was about Congressional process, 
Democrats would be doing what they 
have done in other cases; they would go 
to court. But the reason they haven’t 
gone to court, like they did for 
Trump’s taxes, in the Deutsche Bank 
subpoenas, in the Mazars matter, or in 
the Don McGahn matter, is because in 
each of those circumstances, they did 
not prevail in court. The courts real-
ized that their subpoenas were overly 
broad. 
So instead of using the real process, 
here we are just enduring this politics. 
And because they can’t build back bet-
ter, they have just decided to build 
back meaner. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, just for the record, 
again, the gentleman from Indiana ref-
erenced the whistleblower. We have not 
talked to the whistleblower, but we 
have talked to the whistleblower’s law-
yer. We are doing our work. So, clear-
ly, since he is quoting Politico, I want 
him to just get the record straight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Virginia 
(Mrs. LURIA), who served two decades 
in the Navy and was among the first 
women to serve in the Navy’s nuclear 
power program. 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, to 
‘‘support and defend the Constitution 
of the United States against all en-
emies, foreign and domestic.’’ 
We reaffirmed that oath on January 
3. Yet only 3 days later in this very 
Chamber, this body was assaulted 
while carrying out the peaceful trans-
fer of power, the very hallmark of our 
democracy. 
I first took that oath when I was 17 
years old and entered the Naval Acad-
emy. I was willing to put my life on the 
line to serve my country and protect 
the foundation of this republic, a foun-
dation that was shaken but not broken 
on January 6. 
Mr. Bannon, a former naval officer 
like me, at one point understood this 
oath. He took it multiple times. He 
served his country honorably in the 
Navy. 
I don’t know what happened between 
the time Lieutenant Bannon left the 
Navy and today. What forces corrupted 
his understanding of this oath? 
Mr. Bannon has been given the oppor-
tunity to voluntarily provide informa-
tion relevant to the work of our com-
mittee, but he has not complied. 
Truly, 
this 
is 
larger 
than 
Mr. 
Bannon, this is larger than this inves-
tigation, and this is larger than the 
tragic and horrific events of January 6. 
This vote is a test of that oath. To 
my colleagues who chose to vote 
against enforcing the subpoena, you 
are saying to all future men and 
women who are called before this body 
that they can ignore a subpoena from 
Congress without consequence. 
You can make that choice today. But 
that will be a vote to abdicate the 
power of the legislative branch in 
which you are elected to serve. That 
will be a vote to undermine the govern-
ment and the Constitution which you 
took an oath to support and defend. 
The consequences of that vote won’t 
be limited to this investigation and 
this subpoena alone. Your vote will do 
serious, long-lasting damage to Con-
gress as an institution. That, in turn, 
will do serious damage to our country, 
which we all love so dearly. 
We ask our young men and women in 
uniform to go forth every day and pro-
tect us, to protect this republic, to pro-
tect our form of government. I am ask-
ing you to do the same, to protect our 
democracy from those forces seeking 
to destroy it from within. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
as much time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN). 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Look, we have seen the worst 10 
months of any administration in his-
tory. We went from a secure border to 
chaos. We went from safe streets to 
violent crime. We have seen stable 
prices turn into inflation and empty 
shelves. The respect around the world 
we had has now turned into the debacle 
that was the exit from Afghanistan. 
And we went from peace in the Middle 
East with the Abraham Accords to 
thousands of rockets being fired on our 
friend and ally, Israel; not to mention, 
energy independence to now the spec-
tacle of the President of the United 
States begging OPEC to increase pro-
duction. 
But what scares me most is what this 
administration 
and 
Democrats 
are 
doing to freedom. Every right we enjoy 
under the First Amendment has been 
assaulted over the last year. 
Your right to practice faith. There 
are still places today in the country 
where a full congregation can’t meet 
on Sunday morning. 
Your right to petition your govern-
ment, your right to assemble, freedom 
of the press, freedom of speech—every 
single one has been attacked. 
We just learned in the Judiciary 
Committee from the Attorney General 
that the National School Boards Asso-
ciation last month, September 29, 
sends a letter to the President of the 
United States asking the FBI to get in-
volved in local school board matters. 
Five days later, the Attorney General 
issues a memo to do just that. 
The first sentence of the Attorney 
General’s memo says this: In recent 
months, there has been a disturbing 
spike in harassment, intimidation, and 
threats at school board meetings. 
We asked him a simple question: 
What is the evidence for a spike in 
threats? What is the data? What did 
you review? 
Guess what his answer was. His only 
evidence, the only thing he reviewed, 
was the letter from the school boards 
association, from a political organiza-
tion. Now, they are going to target par-
ents at school board meetings. 
And we have the January 6 com-
mittee issuing subpoena after sub-
poena. Eleven of the people they have 
issued subpoenas to were names on an 
application asking the government for 
permission to hold a rally. Individuals 
exercising 
their 
First 
Amendment 
right to assemble, asked the govern-
ment for permission, the government 
granted them permission, and now 
these 20- and 30-year-olds, whose names 
are on that application, they are going 
to be deposed by these guys for simply 
exercising 
their 
First 
Amendment 
right. 
Here is what they are asking them, 
we want to know who the speakers 
were and how were they selected. We 
want to know any communications 
these people—who put their names on a 
permit, got permission from the gov-
ernment—we want to know any Mem-
ber of Congress you talked to. 
Wow. Your right to petition your 
government, that is why they are sub-
poenaing these people? This is scary, 
where they want to go. 
These 
questions—coordination 
of 
speakers, discussions of contents—this 
sounds like what the IRS did to people 
10 years ago when they were asking 
501(c) groups applying for tax-exempt 
status, do you pray at the start of your 
meeting? 
First, it is school boards, then it is 
people applying for a permit. We saw 
what the IRS did to people just a few 
years ago; not to mention what else 
the committee is doing; preservation 
letters to all of the carriers, all of the 
companies; preserve every call, every 
email, every text. Think about that. 
Every call someone made to—hundreds 
and hundreds, supposedly, according to 
news reports. They have done this for 
texts to your spouse, calls to your 
mom. Preserve it all. And this is just 
what we know about. This is just what 
has been reported. 
And now Steve Bannon. Now Steve 
Bannon. Mr. Bannon is a target of the 
investigation, for the investigation, be-
cause—and this is the select commit-
tee’s own report—‘‘His efforts to plan 
political activity.’’ 
That is the standard. If you are in-
volved in political activity, they are 
going to investigate you. 
We know what this is really about. 
This is about getting at President 
Trump. They tried to stop President 
Trump before he was even elected with 
the Russia investigation; tried to re-
move President Trump from office 
twice while he was in office. And now 
they are trying to get him after the 
fact, after he has left, all because this 
guy cut taxes, reduced regulation, gave 
us the greatest economy in 50 years, 
lowest unemployment, all because he 
built the wall, got us out of the Iran 
deal, put the embassy in Jerusalem. 
When President Trump was President, 
Americans got their Christmas pre-
sents on time. But they are coming 
after him.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5765 
October 21, 2021 
The Reuters story said this: The FBI 
has found no evidence that President 
Trump, or people directly around him, 
were involved in organizing the vio-
lence. 
They don’t care. They don’t care that 
the FBI has no evidence. The Senate 
report said no evidence of a coordi-
nated plan. They don’t care. They are 
going to drag these 11 people in for 
depositions with subpoenas, because 
they are so determined to get their po-
litical enemies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman from Indiana 
has expired. 
b 1530 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Chair, the vice chair of the 
committee put in the RECORD the fact 
that the FBI and Department of Jus-
tice declared no such thing in terms of 
January 6, so the assertion that some-
how they have conducted an investiga-
tion is just not true. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SCHIFF), the distinguished chairman of 
the House Intelligence Committee. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, we are 
here this afternoon to test a propo-
sition as old as the country’s founding: 
Are we a nation of laws? 
We are here because one man has de-
cided that we are now only a nation of 
men and that rich and powerful men 
need not follow the law. And the ques-
tion we must confront is nothing less 
than this: Is he right? 
Are some people now truly above the 
law, beholden to nothing and no one, 
free to ignore the law and without con-
sequence? 
Congress is investigating the worst 
attack on our Capitol in over a cen-
tury, made worse still by the fact that 
it was carried out by our own people, 
people who had been misled to believe 
that their election had been stolen and 
that violence was now justified, people 
who are still being misled by a dan-
gerous lie that may lead to even more 
bloodshed. 
This is not some theoretical matter. 
We were here. We heard the doors 
breaking, the glass shattering, the 
cries from outside the Chamber. And 
we saw the bloody results, the officers 
injured, and those who died. 
And in the wake of the horrors of 
that day, a day in which the Capitol 
Police put their lives on the line to de-
fend our democracy, it falls on us to 
defend that same democracy, albeit at 
far less risk to ourselves. 
The Founders intended that ambition 
should be made to check ambition. If 
we fail to uphold Congress’ power to 
compel information, then we cease to 
be a coequal branch of government, un-
able to perform our oversight or check 
any abuses of executive power. 
Take away a court’s power to sub-
poena witnesses, and it fails to be a 
court. Take away the Congress’ ability 
to do the same, and it fails to be a Con-
gress, becoming instead a mere play-
thing for a corrupt executive. 
Do not believe for one moment that 
if we fail to hold Steve Bannon ac-
countable that he will be the excep-
tion. He will become the rule—not a 
rule of law, but the misrule of men. 
Either we are all equal before the law 
or none of us is. This is the essence of 
our democracy. 
As Lincoln said, ‘‘Whatever differs 
from this, to the extent of the dif-
ference, is no democracy.’’ 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Wyoming has 51⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Mississippi has 2 minutes remaining. 
The gentleman from Indiana has no 
time remaining. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, just outside this 
Chamber, over the north door in Stat-
uary Hall, which was the old House 
Chamber, stands a statue of Clio, the 
muse of history. She is one of the old-
est works of art in our Capitol. She 
stands in a winged chariot, the chariot 
of time, and she takes notes in her 
book, reminding all of us that our 
words and our actions will be judged by 
history. History will particularly judge 
those of us in positions of public trust 
for what we are doing today. 
In the immediate aftermath of the 
attack, Madam Speaker, we all recog-
nized how profoundly wrong January 6 
was. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
JORDAN), who just suggested that we 
were here because we opposed Presi-
dent Trump’s policies, seems to have 
forgotten that actually on January 6 
he, himself, said, ‘‘What happened 
today is wrong and is not what Amer-
ica is about.’’ 
The next day Mr. JORDAN said, ‘‘What 
happened Wednesday is a tragedy. Ev-
eryone knows that. It is as wrong as 
wrong can be.’’ 
And today, Madam Speaker, the 
former President suggested that the vi-
olence was justified. 
My colleagues in the Republican 
Party, the Republican Members of this 
body, have to understand, have to rec-
ognize, that there is a moment when 
politics must stop if we want to defend 
and protect our institutions. 
A violent assault on the Capitol to 
stop 
the 
constitutional 
process 
of 
counting electoral votes is that mo-
ment. They all knew that on that day. 
In fact, the minority leader himself 
stood in this Chamber and said, ‘‘The 
President 
bears 
responsibility 
for 
Wednesday’s attack on Congress by 
mob rioters. He should have imme-
diately denounced the mob when he 
saw what was unfolding.’’ 
Mr. MCCARTHY was right then. The 
President bears responsibility. 
We need to know what happened. 
This body must have the ability to un-
derstand what caused the attack, to 
understand who was responsible, and to 
take legislative action to ensure that 
it never happens again. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this motion for con-
tempt for Mr. Steve Bannon. I urge 
them to do so because it is right; it is 
morally right; it is constitutionally 
right; and it is all of our duty. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time to close. 
Over the last hour, we have heard a 
lot about what we are not debating 
today. The select committee is charged 
with investigating a deadly attack on 
the seat of our democracy and making 
recommendations to ensure it never 
happens again. I can’t think of any-
thing more serious, but many of our 
colleagues would rather talk about 
anything else. 
I think I know why. I think they are 
performing for an audience of one. 
I do, however, want to commend my 
colleagues on the select committee for 
laying out clearly why the House must 
cite Mr. Bannon for contempt. If our 
investigation is to succeed, if the 
House’s constitutional authority to in-
vestigate and legislate is to remain ro-
bust, then we cannot let this man flout 
the laws with impunity. 
The select committee is made up of 
people of character, of profound com-
mitment to public service and our Con-
stitution. They all elevate the commit-
tee’s work. 
I especially want to thank and ac-
knowledge our vice chair, the gentle-
woman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY), 
for her leadership and partnership. 
There is no doubt in my mind that his-
tory will record her courage in stark 
relief. 
History will record all of what we do 
here today. We can be on the right side 
or the wrong side. I urge all my col-
leagues to remember that as we cast 
this vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, today the House has been delib-
erating on the criminal contempt of Congress 
citation of Steven K. Bannon reported from the 
Select Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Capitol on 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021. This is a grave 
matter and not one the House takes lightly. 
As I have said on many occasions, the Se-
lect Committee would prefer not to be in this 
position. We expect—and the law (2 U.S.C. 
§ 192) demands—witnesses comply with duly 
issued, lawful subpoenas of Congress. We lay 
out the factual record of Mr. Bannon’s willful 
defiance of the Select Committee’s September 
23, 2021, subpoena in House Report 117– 
152. 
There have been developments since the 
Report was written and adopted, and I memo-
rialized some of those at the Select Commit-
tee’s business meeting. To perfect the factual 
record in this case, I now include in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD correspondence between 
myself and Mr. Bannon’s attorney, Robert J. 
Costello, and further correspondence between 
the Office of White House Counsel and Mr. 
Costello, which states President Biden’s posi-
tion on issues relating to the subpoena to Mr. 
Bannon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5766 
October 21, 2021 
First, on Friday, October 15, 2021, I wrote 
Mr. Costello to reiterate to him and his client 
that the Select Committee would view Mr. 
Bannon’s decision not to appear for his depo-
sition as willful defiance that would lead to a 
business meeting of the Select Committee to 
consider a contempt report. I include that letter 
in the RECORD. 
SELECT COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE 
THE JANUARY 6TH ATTACK ON THE 
UNITED STATES CAPITOL, 
October 15, 2021. 
Mr. ROBERT J. COSTELLO, 
Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP, 
* * * 
DEAR
MR. COSTELLO: The Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th At-
tack (‘‘Select Committee’’) is in receipt of 
your October 13, 2021 letter (the ‘‘October 13 
letter’’), in which you reassert that your cli-
ent, Stephen Bannon, will not comply with 
the September 23, 2021 Subpoena to him for 
documents and deposition testimony (the 
‘‘Subpoena’’). As you know, the Subpoena de-
manded that Mr. Bannon produce documents 
by October 7, 2021 and appear on October 14, 
2021 before the Select Committee to provide 
deposition testimony on a wide range of 
issues relating to the January 6, 2021 attack 
on the United States Capitol, as well as 
plans to interfere with the count of the 2020 
Electoral College results. Mr. Bannon has 
now willfully failed to both produce a single 
document and to appear for his scheduled 
deposition. The Select Committee believes 
that this willful refusal to comply with the 
Subpoena constitutes a violation of federal 
law. 
As justification for Mr. Bannon’s complete 
failure to comply with any portion of the 
Subpoena, you continue to rely on ex-Presi-
dent Trump’s stated intention to invoke ex-
ecutive privilege with respect to Mr. Bannon, 
and Mr. Trump’s purported request that Mr. 
Bannon not produce documents to or testify 
before the Select Committee. As was ex-
plained in the Select Committee’s October 8, 
2021 letter (attached), the former President 
has not communicated any such assertion of 
privilege, whether formally or informally, to 
the Select Committee. Moreover, we believe 
that any such assertion of privilege—should 
it be made by the former President—will not 
prevent the Select Committee from lawfully 
obtaining the information it seeks. 
Further, your letter makes no attempt to 
justify Mr. Bannon’s failure to comply with 
the Subpoena’s demand for documents and 
testimony on a range of subjects that do not 
involve communications with the former 
President. As is clear from the Subpoena and 
accompanying letter, and as underscored in 
the Select Committee’s October 8, 2021 re-
sponse letter, the Select Committee seeks 
documents and testimony on numerous other 
matters, including Mr. Bannon’s communica-
tions with Members of Congress, presidential 
campaign representatives, and other private 
parties concerning the events of January 6, 
2021, that could not conceivably be barred by 
a privilege claim. 
Moreover, even if the Select Committee 
were inclined to accept the unsupported 
premise that executive privilege reaches 
communications that the Select Committee 
seeks to examine between President Trump 
and Mr. Bannon, Mr. Bannon does not enjoy 
any form of absolute immunity from testi-
fying or producing documents in response to 
a Congressional subpoena. Your citation to 
Committee on Judiciary v. McGahn, 415 F. 
Supp. 3d 148 (D.D.C. 2019) actually supports 
the Select Committee, not your client. In 
McGahn, the district court unequivocally 
held that even senior White House aides are 
not entitled to absolute immunity from tes-
tifying in response to a Congressional sub-
poena. Id. at 214 (‘‘To make the point as 
plain as possible, it is clear to this Court . . . 
that, with respect to senior-level presi-
dential aides, absolute immunity from com-
pelled congressional process simply does not 
exist.’’). Indeed, the footnote in McGahn that 
you selectively quote makes clear that a 
President lacks legal authority to order an 
aide not to appear before Congress based on 
a claim of executive privilege. See Id. at 213, 
n. 34 (‘‘But the invocation of the privilege by 
a testifying aide is an order of magnitude 
different than DOJ’s current claim that the 
President essentially owns the entirety of a 
senior-level aide’s testimony such that the 
White House can order the individual not to 
appear before Congress at all.’’ (Emphasis in 
original)). 
Accordingly, the Select Committee views 
Mr. Bannon’s failure to produce documents 
by the October 7, 2021 deadline as willful non- 
compliance with the Subpoena. Mr. Bannon 
has persisted in his refusal to produce any 
documents to the Select Committee, and he 
has failed to provide a privilege log identi-
fying 
specific, 
asserted 
privileges. 
Mr. 
Bannon has now further compounded his 
non-compliance by refusing to appear on Oc-
tober 14, 2021 at the Select Committee depo-
sition to which he was summoned to provide 
testimony. The Select Committee will there-
fore be meeting on Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
to consider invoking the contempt of Con-
gress procedures set forth in 2 U.S.C. §§ 192, 
194. 
If Mr. Bannon believes that there are any 
additional issues relating to his non-compli-
ance with the Subpoena that have not been 
addressed, please submit them in writing to 
the Select Committee by 6:00 p.m. E.S.T. on 
Monday, October 18, 2021 for the Select Com-
mittee’s consideration in its deliberations. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, at 6 p.m. on Monday, October 18, 
2021, Mr. Costello replied to that letter and re-
quested a 1-week ‘‘adjournment’’ to respond. 
Mr. Bannon’s attorney said they needed time 
to ‘‘assess’’ the Select Committee’s requests 
for documents and testimony in light of litiga-
tion filed by former President Trump in DC 
District Court. I include Mr. Costello’s letter in 
the RECORD.

Re: The Subpoena for Stephen K. Bannon 
dated September 23, 2021. 
Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, House Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack, 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN THOMPSON: We write 
on behalf of Stephen Bannon. We have just 
been advised of the filing of a lawsuit in fed-
eral court for the District of Columbia enti-
tled Donald J. Trump v. Bennie Thompson, 
et al., 21–Civ–02769 (D.D.C. 2021). In light of 
this late filing, we respectfully request a 
one-week adjournment of our response to 
your latest letter so that we might thought-
fully assess the impact of this pending litiga-
tion. 
Very truly yours, 
ROBERT J. COSTELLO. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, the former President’s lawsuit, how-
ever, is immaterial to Mr. Bannon’s defiance of 
our lawful subpoena. As House Report 117– 
152 makes clear, Mr. Bannon had a duty to 
produce documents and appear before the 
Select Committee. His flat refusal to comply 
with the subpoena is unacceptable. I made 
that clear in a letter to Mr. Costello before the 
Select Committee’s business meeting on 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021. I include in the 
RECORD my response to Mr. Costello’s Octo-
ber 18th letter. 
SELECT COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE 
THE JANUARY 6TH ATTACK ON THE 
UNITED STATES CAPITOL, 
October 19, 2021. 
Mr. ROBERT J. COSTELLO, 
Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP, 
DEAR
MR. COSTELLO: The Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th At-
tack on the United States Capitol (‘‘Select 
Committee’’) is in receipt of your October 18, 
2021, letter requesting a one-week ‘‘adjourn-
ment’’ of your response to my October 15, 
2021, letter. The only basis for your request 
is yesterday’s filing of litigation by former 
President Trump against the Chairman, Se-
lect Committee, Archivist of the United 
States, and the National Archives and 
Records Administration. That litigation re-
lates to the Select Committee’s requests for 
documents in the possession of the National 
Archives and is immaterial to the Select 
Committee’s demand for documents and tes-
timony from Mr. Bannon. The investigation 
of the Select Committee is extremely impor-
tant and urgent for the nation, and further 
delay in compliance by Mr. Bannon under-
mines the ability of the Committee to time-
ly complete its essential responsibilities. Ac-
cordingly, no grounds exist for any ‘‘adjourn-
ment’’ or other delay and your request is de-
nied. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, meanwhile, with regard to Mr. 
Bannon’s claims that executive privileges 
somehow precluded his production or appear-
ance pursuant to the Select Committee’s sub-
poena, on Monday, October 18, 2021, the Of-
fice of White House Counsel wrote a letter to 
Mr. Costello and specifically stated that ‘‘at 
this point we are not aware of any basis for 
[Mr. Bannon’s] refusal to appear for a deposi-
tion.’’ It further stated that President Biden 
‘‘has already determined that an assertion of 
executive privilege is not in the public interest, 
and therefore is not justified, with respect to 
certain subjects within the purview of the Se-
lect Committee.’’ I include the full White House 
letter in the RECORD. 
THE WHITE HOUSE, 
Washington, DC, October 18, 2021. 
ROBERT J. COSTELLO, 
Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP, 
* * *. 
DEAR MR. COSTELLO: I write regarding the 
subpoena for documents and deposition testi-
mony issued on September 23, 2021, by the 
House Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the United States 
Capitol (the ‘‘Select Committee’’) to your 
client, Stephen K. Bannon. 
As you are aware, Mr. Bannon’s tenure as 
a White House employee ended in 2017. To 
the extent any privileges could apply to Mr. 
Bannon’s conversations with the former 
President or White House staff after the con-
clusion of his tenure, President Biden has al-
ready determined that an assertion of execu-
tive privilege is not in the public interest, 
and therefore is not justified, with respect to 
certain subjects within the purview of the 
Select Committee. Specifically, President 
Biden determined that an assertion of execu-
tive privilege is not justified with respect to 
a set of documents shedding light on events 
within the White House on and about Janu-
ary 6, 2021, and with respect to documents

and testimony concerning the former Presi-
dent’s efforts to use the Department of Jus-
tice to advance a false narrative that the 
2020 election was tainted by widespread 
fraud. President Biden’s determination that 
an assertion of privilege is not justified with 
respect to these subjects applies to your cli-
ent’s deposition testimony and to any docu-
ments your client may possess concerning ei-
ther subject. 
Please contact me if you have questions 
about the matters described herein. Please 
note, however, that at this point we are not 
aware of any basis for your client’s refusal to 
appear for a deposition. 
Sincerely, 
JONATHAN C. SU, 
Deputy Counsel to the President. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, after the Select Committee’s October 
19th business meeting, I wrote to Mr. Costello 
yet again to urge Mr. Bannon to change 
course and comply with the Select Commit-
tee’s subpoena of September 23, 2021. I reit-
erated that Mr. Costello’s stated reasons for 
Mr. Bannon’s flat refusal to provide documents 
and appear at a deposition have no legal 
basis or support. I provided him with a link to 
the Select Committee’s adopted report on a 
contempt citation to review the detailed basis 
for our recommendation to the House. I in-
clude my October 19th letter in the RECORD. 
SELECT COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE 
THE JANUARY 6TH ATTACK ON THE 
UNITED STATES CAPITOL, 
October 19, 2021. 
Mr. ROBERT J. COSTELLO, 
Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP, 
* * *. 
DEAR MR. COSTELLO: I write yet again to 
urge your client Stephen K. Bannon to 
change course and comply with the Sep-
tember 23, 2021, subpoena from the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol (‘‘Select 
Committee’’). 
As explained in our prior correspondence, 
your stated reasons for Mr. Bannon’s flat re-
fusal to provide documents and appear at a 
deposition have no legal basis or support. Be-
cause of Mr. Bannon’s continued refusal to 
comply with the subpoena, the Select Com-
mittee has unanimously voted to recommend 
that the House of Representatives find Mr. 
Bannon to be in contempt of Congress. The 
detailed basis for that recommendation is 
contained in the Select Committee’s report, 
a copy of which is available at the following 
link: 
https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Cal-
endar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=114156. Should 
the House of Representatives agree with that 
recommendation, the Speaker of the House 
will certify the relevant statement of facts 
to the United States Attorney for the Dis-
trict of Columbia, ‘‘whose duty it shall be to 
bring the matter before the grand jury for its 
action.’’ See 2 U.S.C. § 194. 
Additionally, President Biden’s recently 
communicated views relating to your cli-
ent’s reliance on executive privilege as a 
basis for his non-compliance provide further 
support for the Select Committee’s position. 
As you know, in its October 18, 2021, letter, 
the Office of the White House Counsel con-
cluded that ‘‘at this point we are not aware 
of any basis for [Mr. Bannon’s] refusal to ap-
pear for a deposition.’’ The letter further 
noted that President Biden has ‘‘already de-
termined that an assertion of executive 
privilege is not in the public interest, and 
therefore is not justified, with respect to cer-
tain subjects within the purview of the Se-
lect Committee.’’ In short, the current Presi-
dent’s statements should remove any doubt 
regarding 
the 
inappropriateness 
of 
Mr. 
Bannon’s reliance on assertions of executive 
privilege as grounds for his noncompliance 
with the subpoena. Mr. Bannon has no basis 
in law to continue to defy the appropriate 
use of congressional subpoena authority. 
These developments underscore the folly of 
any continuing defiance of the Select Com-
mittee subpoena by Mr. Bannon. The Select 
Committee remains focused on expeditiously 
obtaining the testimony and documents nec-
essary to meet our responsibilities and we 
continue to expect immediate compliance by 
Mr. Bannon. Should Mr. Bannon choose to 
change his posture, please notify Select 
Committee staff * * *. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, the importance of our investigation, 
and the recommendations we make for legis-
lative and other policy changes that result 
from our investigation, require the participation 
of witnesses who have clear knowledge of the 
events leading up to and during the January 
6th attack. Mr. Bannon’s own actions in defi-
ance of our lawful subpoena for a valid legisla-
tive purpose demand the consequences re-
flected in the House resolution citing him with 
contempt and referring his case to the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, Congress has a long-recognized and 
essential role in conducting oversight. The Se-
lect Committee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol has the 
solemn responsibility to investigate and report 
upon the facts, circumstances, and causes re-
lated to the attack on January 6, 2021. This 
domestic terrorist attack sought to interfere 
with the peaceful transfer of power and under-
mine American representative democracy dur-
ing the exercise of a constitutional process. 
Mr. Bannon reportedly held multiple roles 
and had specific knowledge relevant to the in-
vestigation of the January 6th attack on the 
Capitol. Mr. Bannon has defied a lawful Con-
gressional subpoena. The investigation by the 
Select Committee is fundamental to our de-
mocracy, and I will vote today to hold Mr. 
Bannon in contempt of Congress for his failure 
to comply with a Congressional Subpoena. Mr. 
Bannon has a duty to cooperate with the Con-
gressional investigation into the fundamental 
attack on our democracy on January 6th. 
Therefore, I will vote in support of finding Ste-
phen K. Bannon in contempt of Congress for 
failure to comply with a Congressional sub-
poena. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, and on the 
Budget, I rise in support of the rule governing 
debate for H. Res. 730, ‘‘Resolution Recom-
mending that the House of Representatives 
Find Stephen K. Bannon in Contempt of Con-
gress for Refusal to Comply with a Subpoena 
Duly Issued by the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol.’’ 
On January 6th the domestic terrorists who 
beat law enforcement officers and breached 
the Citadel of democracy of the United States 
wore insignias of White Supremacist groups, 
waved confederate flags, hung a noose on the 
lawn, and they were shouting racial epithets. 
According to published reports and his own 
public statements, Mr. Bannon had specific 
knowledge about the events planned for Janu-
ary 6th before they occurred: just before the 
day of the attack, Mr. Bannon told his lis-
teners: 
All hell is going to break loose tomorrow 
. . . It’s not going to happen like you think 
it’s going to happen. OK, it’s going to be 
quite extraordinarily different. All I can say 
is, strap in . . . You made this happen and 
tomorrow it’s game day. So strap in. Let’s 
get ready. So many people said, ‘Man, if I 
was in a revolution, I would be in Wash-
ington.’ Well this is your time in history. 
At 12:15 p.m. on January 6th he said to the 
assembled multitude on the Ellipse: ‘‘You will 
never take back our country with weakness.’’ 
Less than an hour later, at 1:10 p.m., he ad-
monished the crowd: ‘‘We fight like hell, and if 
you don’t fight like hell you will not have a 
country anymore.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the assault on the U.S. 
Capitol by domestic terrorists and insurrection-
ists rightly takes its place as one of the dark-
est moments in our nation’s history since the 
Civil War. 
Madam Speaker, the January 6 insurrection 
caused tragic loss of life and many injuries, 
while leaving behind widespread physical 
damage to the Capitol Complex and emotional 
trauma for Members, Congressional employ-
ees, and the Capitol Police. 
It bears repeating often that the Congress 
and the nation owe undying gratitude to the 
men and women who answered the call of 
constitutional duty and heroically won the day 
on that bloody and deadly afternoon. 
Madam Speaker, the domestic terrorists and 
seditionists who attacked the Capitol Building 
on January 6, 2021 were not, as some of their 
ardent defenders and apologists across the 
aisle have stated falsely, on a ‘‘normal tour 
visit’’; nor was their effort to lay siege to the 
Capitol and disrupt the processes of govern-
ment an act of persons who love their country. 
And it is absurd to suggest that it was a 
celebration of the United States and what it 
stands for when the leading edge of terrorists 
desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading 
the treasonous Confederate flag through the 
building and when, because of their insurrec-
tion, several members of law enforcement 
made the supreme sacrifice and scores more 
were seriously injured. 
Madam Speaker, we owe it not just to those 
who lost their lives during that day, but to all 
Americans to figure out exactly what hap-
pened and how that day came to be. 
We must understand that day in order to 
prevent the intended purpose of the January 6 
insurrection—to disrupt the Joint Meeting of 
Congress to tally the votes of presidential 
electors and announce the results to the na-
tion and the world—from every occurring 
again, because it was the greatest threat to 
the American Experiment since the Civil War 
when the pro-slavery forces decided to make 
war rather than let the nation survive. and the 
pro-freedom forces would accept war rather 
than let the nation perish. 
The Select Committee has diligently contin-
ued in their duty to determine the causes and 
events that transpired during the insurrec-
tionist attack. 
Specifically, the Select Committee’s pur-
poses include: 
To investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the Janu-
ary 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the 
United States Capitol Complex;’’

October 21, 2021 
To investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the inter-
ference with the peaceful transfer of power;’’ 
and 
To investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes relating to ‘‘the influ-
encing factors that fomented such an attack 
on American representative democracy while 
engaged in a constitutional process.’’ 
In line with these purposes, the Select Com-
mittee requested information from Mr. Bannon 
central to its legislative purpose: 
On September 23, 2021, Chairman Thomp-
son signed and transmitted a subpoena to Mr. 
Bannon, ordering the production of both docu-
ments and testimony relevant to the January 
6th attack on the Capitol. 
The subpoena required Mr. Bannon to 
produce the documents on October 7 and re-
quired his presence for deposition testimony 
on October 14. 
Mr. Bannon simply defied the subpoena— 
failing to produce the documents on October 7 
and failing to show up for the deposition on 
October 14. 
In a letter to Mr. Bannon’s counsel on Octo-
ber 15, Chairman Thompson noted that Mr. 
Bannon had not even attempted to provide the 
Select Committee any explanation for refusing 
to comply with the Select Committee’s de-
mand for documents and testimony on a 
range of subjects that do not involve commu-
nications with the former President. 
An individual who fails or refuses to comply 
with a House subpoena may be cited for con-
tempt of Congress, and in his October 8th let-
ter to Mr. Bannon’s counsel, Chairman 
Thompson warned Mr. Bannon that his contin-
ued non-compliance would put him in jeopardy 
of a vote to refer him to the House to consider 
a criminal contempt referral. 
Mr. Bannon’s failure to appear for deposition 
or produce responsive documents in the face 
of this clear advisement and warning by the 
Chairman constitutes willful failure to comply 
with the subpoena. 
The purpose behind seeking this information 
is because Mr. Bannon played a central role 
in organizing January 6th attack on the Cap-
itol, and understanding this role is essential to 
understanding the context in which the Janu-
ary 6th attack occurred. 
Mr. Bannon constructed and participated in 
the ‘‘stop the steal’’ public relations effort that 
motivated the January 6th attack. 
Mr. Bannon planned political and other ac-
tivities in advance of January 6th. 
Mr. Bannon participated in a ‘‘war room’’ of 
promoters and prominent supporters of the 
‘‘stop the steal’’ movement that met on Janu-
ary 5th. 
Mr. Bannon communicated with President 
Trump several times in advance of the Janu-
ary 6th attack, urging him to take measures to 
interfere with the count of electoral votes and 
to make January 6th a day of reckoning. 
In fact, according to published reports and 
his own public statements, Mr. Bannon had 
specific knowledge about the events planned 
for January 6th before they occurred: just be-
fore the day of the attack, Mr. Bannon urged 
his listeners: 
All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. 
. . . It’s not going to happen like you think 
it’s going to happen. OK, it’s going to be 
quite extraordinarily different. All I can say 
is, strap in. You made this happen and to-
morrow it’s game day. So strap in. Let’s get 
ready. So many people said, ‘Man, if I was in 
a revolution, I would be in Washington.’ Well 
this is your time in history. 
In sum, Mr. Bannon appears to have played 
a multi-faceted role in the events of the Janu-
ary 6th attack and the American people are 
entitled to hear his first-hand testimony regard-
ing his actions. 
As recognized by the Supreme Court, ‘‘The 
power of the Congress to conduct investiga-
tions is inherent in the legislative process,’’ 
and that the subpoena power is a ‘‘public duty, 
which every person within the jurisdiction of 
the Government is bound to perform when 
properly summoned.’’ 
Rather than comply with Congress’ inherent 
powers, and help heal the trauma this nation 
witnessed on January 6th, Mr. Bannon has 
simply refused to comply with the Select Com-
mittee’s subpoena. 
Madam Speaker, this should not be a par-
tisan issue; it is the very power of Congress 
to investigate matters of issue that is at stake. 
For this reason, I rise in support of the rule 
governing debate for H. Res. 370, ‘‘Resolution 
Recommending that the House of Representa-
tives Find Stephen K. Bannon in Contempt of 
Congress for Refusal to Comply with a Sub-
poena Duly Issued by the Select Committee to 
Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
United States Capitol,’’ and I encourage my 
colleagues to do the same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time

Pursuant to the rule, the previous

The question is on adoption of the

PROVIDING 
ACCOMMODATIONS 
FOR NURSING MOTHERS IN THE 
WORKPLACE 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act, which will be 
considered by the House later this 
week. 
As a working mother, I strongly sup-
port this bipartisan bill to provide rea-
sonable accommodations to nursing 
mothers in the workplace. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, 
among other critical changes, would 
extend the break time and space pro-
tections to workers who are currently 
excluded from overtime protections, 
including 
teachers, 
transportation 
workers, and agriculture workers. 
I was proud to work as part of a bi-
partisan group along with the bill’s 
sponsor, Representative CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY, 
to 
offer 
an 
amendment 
which maintains the undue hardship 
exemption threshold at its current 
level of 50 employees. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act 
is supported by a broad coalition of 
stakeholders, including the National 
Retail Federation, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, the National Education As-
sociation, and the American Civil Lib-
erties Union. 
Mr. Speaker, I enthusiastically sup-
port this bill and urge all Members to 
do the same when it comes before the 
House this week. 
f 
IRS DATA COLLECTION PROPOSAL 
BAD FOR FAMILIES, BUSINESSES 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to encourage my colleagues to 
join me in opposition to the proposed 
IRS reporting plan that would intrude 
on the bank accounts of Americans and 
impose new regulations on our already 
overregulated banking system. 
First, it is not apparent that the IRS 
has any constitutional authority to 
monitor Americans in this way. 
Second, the American public does not 
support the expansion of IRS bank data 
collection. Recent polling shows bipar-
tisan opposition, with 67 percent of 
those polled opposed to the IRS col-
lecting bank deposit and withdrawal 
information. 
Finally, this would add another regu-
latory burden to our financial institu-
tions after a historic year when banks 
and credit unions provided lifelines to 
families, businesses, and communities 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This proposal imposes upon our right 
to privacy and is bad for families, 
small businesses, and financial institu-
tions. I hope my colleagues across the 
aisle will reconsider their support for 
this unwarranted expansion of govern-
ment. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER FOR 
HEALTHCARE 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, for far 
too long, America’s broken for-profit 
healthcare system has left millions of 
Americans uninsured or underinsured. 
While out-of-pocket costs and cor-
porate profits continue to rise, 8 mil-
lion Americans have turned to a new 
form of health insurance, online fund-
raisers like GoFundMe, to pay their 
medical bills. 
My nephew, Sean Day, was one of 
them. He passed away from cancer ear-
lier this month at just 22 years of age. 
Mr. Speaker, we live in the richest 
country in the world. No one should be 
priced out of the healthcare that they 
need or delay seeing a doctor just be-
cause they can’t afford it. No one 
should be forced to ask strangers on-
line to crowdsource their medical bills. 
It is simply not right. 
This is why we must pass the Build 
Back Better Act. The Build Back Bet-
ter Act will invest in our communities’ 
healthcare, expand medical coverage 
for our kupuna, and lower prescription 
drug prices. It will save lives. 
During the deadliest pandemic in 
U.S. history, we must deliver the care 
that American families deserve. We 
must leave no one behind. 
f 
BIDEN’S BANK SURVEILLANCE 
SCHEME IS POWER GRAB 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the 
Biden proposed surveillance scheme is 
an ill-advised power grab, which is 
turning trusted local financial institu-
tions into IRS reporting agents infring-
ing upon the privacy of everyday 
Americans. 
The IRS already knows how much 
you earn. Now they want to know ex-
actly how you spend it. This is a total 
breach of personal financial privacy 
with a presumption of guilt that I am 
not okay with. 
How can we expect our citizens to 
place trust in their government when 
their government is keeping tabs on 
their every single transaction? 
A lot of people wonder how people 
come to Congress and become million-
aires while they are serving in Con-
gress. 
This is just another push by the gov-
ernment to exercise control over our 
everyday lives. It is also a disincentive 
for people to save and keep money in 
banks and credit unions because they 
don’t want to have every single thing 
tracked. Do we want to have our sav-
ings kept in coffee cans or mattresses? 
That is a pretty bad way to go. 
Whether it is $600 per transaction or 
up to $10,000 per year cumulative, it is 
an invasion of privacy. We don’t need 
another 80,000 IRS agents tracking us 
when we have a border that is like a 
sieve and other problems of much 
greater magnitude than what you or I 
are saving or spending our personal 
wealth on. 
It is a wrongheaded policy. The Biden 
administration and this House needs to 
take back such ideas. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DR. RENEE F. 
WASHINGTON GARDNER 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a woman of many firsts, 
an upstanding member of our commu-
nity, and someone I am blessed to call 
a constituent. Her name is Dr. Renee 
F. Washington Gardner. 
She is the longest-serving female 
pastor of Harlem’s Memorial Baptist 
Church in its entire history, dedicating 
decades of her life in service to church, 
her community, and God. This past 
Sunday marked her 17th year of serv-
ice. 
She is the first woman to also be 
named a moderator of the United Mis-
sionary Baptist Association in the 
group’s 60-year history. Pastor Gardner

is no stranger to shattering glass ceil-
ings and paving the way for the next 
generation of cleric leaders. 
Under her guiding principle of unity, 
hope, and grace, Memorial Baptist 
Church 
has 
proven 
vital 
to 
the 
strength and resiliency of Harlem, and 
we are forever indebted. 
With Pastor Gardner at the helm, I 
trust that this work is only the begin-
ning, and the Memorial Baptist Church 
will continue their mission of uplifting 
our community’s most vulnerable and 
ingraining the spirit of strength into 
the fabric of our neighborhood. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ALBERT EDWARD 
PELHAM 
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Albert Edward Pelham, a 
beloved community leader and student 
advocate from my town, Montclair, 
New Jersey. 
Al was known for bringing people to-
gether. His work aided and inspired 
generations of Montclairians, and he 
leaves behind a beautiful legacy. 
Al was raised in Montclair and grad-
uated from Montclair High School. He 
served our country in the U.S. Army 
before returning to New Jersey and 
graduating from Bloomfield College. 
From his leadership in the Montclair 
NAACP, the Montclair Neighborhood 
Development Corporation, Statewide 
Parent Advocacy Network, Montclair 
African-American 
Heritage 
Founda-
tion, and more, he dedicated himself to 
making his community a better and 
fairer place. 
One of Al’s many achievements was 
the creation of Project Oasis, which of-
fers year-round educational and rec-
reational opportunities for students. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic began, 
Al adapted the program and organized 
a remote learning space so that all stu-
dents had access to a computer to at-
tend their virtual classes. 
He also created a program for stu-
dents who were suspended to provide 
them with academic training and coun-
seling as an alternative to staying at 
home. 
Al worked to ensure that all stu-
dents, regardless of their background, 
had opportunities to excel. 
Al fought tirelessly for racial justice 
and 
inclusivity, 
guiding 
both 
the 
Montclair NAACP and the Montclair 
African-American Heritage Foundation 
through especially difficult times in 
our country. In 2019, he was recognized 
for these efforts with the Essex County 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Leadership 
Award. 
Al’s dedication to his community was 
matched by his deep commitment to 
his family. Al took any opportunity he 
could to be with his wife, Audrey; his 
children, Dwayne and Rhonda; his 
grandchildren, Charles and Cameron; 
his sisters; and extended family. 
On August 19, 2021, Al passed away 
after a battle with cancer. His selfless 
commitment to making Montclair a 
better place will not soon be forgotten. 
I was honored to have known Al and to 
have called him my friend. The counsel 
he gave me and so many others over 
the years will continue to impact us 
and the entire Montclair community 
for generations to come. 
f 
WE 
CANNOT 
ALLOW 
AN 
INDI-
VIDUAL TO UNDERMINE DEMOC-
RACY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to be able to further defend 
and add to my statement regarding H. 
Res. 730 recommending that the House 
of Representatives find Stephen K. 
Bannon in contempt of Congress. 
It is well known that even from his 
own words and published reports, these 
are the words that Mr. Bannon told his 
listeners: 
‘‘All hell is going to break loose to-
morrow.’’ 
‘‘It is not going to happen like you 
think it is going to happen. Okay. It is 
going to be quite extraordinarily dif-
ferent. All I can say is, strap in. . . . 
You have made this happen, and to-
morrow, it is game day. So strap in. 
Let’s get ready.’’ 
‘‘So many people through my life 
said, man, if I was in the Revolution, I 
would be with Washington at Trenton. 
Well, this is your time in history.’’ 
There is no constitutional provision 
that would deny the January 6th Select 
Committee the right to receive infor-
mation from Mr. Bannon after he has 
been subpoenaed for information re-
garding the insurrection, the riot, the 
attack on January 6. 
The idea of executive privilege is ex-
erted by the existing President, limited 
on a President of the United States no 
longer in office. In fact, Mr. Bannon 
has been gone from the White House 
since 2017. He has no legitimate basis. 
Based on three equal branches of gov-
ernment, we cannot allow an individual 
to undermine democracy. This is a 
democratic republic, and I expect that 
the referral to the United States De-
partment of Justice will be handled. 
f 
INVESTMENTS TO BUILD BACK 
BETTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BOWMAN). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. 
LEGER FERNANDEZ) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, we are here today to talk 
about the importance of this historic 
moment indeed, this historic moment 
of where we will be investing—invest-
ing in our children, investing in our 
planet, investing in our future. We are 
talking about the Build Back Better 
agenda. 
I want to begin by talking about my 
district, which is made up of beau-
tifully diverse rural communities. My 
district is the size of Pennsylvania, but 
my communities in this district are 
rich in culture and rich in love. You 
know what? They have also been his-
torically left behind with little invest-
ments made to improve their lives and 
to allow them to thrive. 
New Mexican values are rooted in 
caring for each other. We know that we 
invest in what we care about. We know 
we invest in what we believe in. Well, 
we must invest in addressing the cli-
mate crisis because, in my district, we 
know that agua es vida, water is life. 
Our farmers and ranchers are depend-
ing on us to act and preserve their 
water resources. 
Communities along our rivers, along 
our acequias, need us to pass a Build 
Back Better plan that tackles the cri-
sis head-on so that we can preserve the 
water flowing from our mountains and 
cascading along our streams for dec-
ades to come—to feed our ranchers, to 
feed our farmers, and to quench our 
thirst. 
In these same communities, people 
often come back home to care for their 
loved ones, their parents and grand-
parents. I have heard their stories. We 
asked them: Why did you come back? 
It is because there was nobody else 
available to care for my grandmother. 
There was nobody else to care for my 
tia. And we know that that care is a 
full-time job on its own. 
What does it take to go to work in 
rural America? It is more than just 
roads and bridges. It is comprehensive 
paid family and medical care. It is in-
vestments in long-term care and af-
fordable childcare. 
b 1630 
In my State, 53 percent of people live 
in a childcare desert. Seventy-one per-
cent of rural families live in areas 
without enough licensed childcare pro-
viders. We can change that. 
The Build Back Better plan must in-
vest in our rural communities. We are 
talking about empowering rural re-
gions, including our Tribal nations, 
with the resources to grow their econo-
mies, expanding access to affordable 
healthcare, lowering prescription drug 
prices, and making housing affordable. 
We can do this for our communities 
now. We can make this happen. We 
made progress with the American Res-
cue Plan, but we cannot stop there. We 
must build back better. 
It is not good enough to go back to 
where we were, because we know that 
where we were wasn’t good enough. So

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5771 
October 21, 2021 
we need to make sure that the child 
tax credit does not run out. We cannot 
kick our children out who came out of 
poverty. Fifty percent of the children 
in poverty in my State came out, and 
I am not willing to tell them: I am 
sorry, the clock struck 12, and you 
must go back into living in poverty. 
No. We must include an expansion ex-
tension of the child tax credit in the 
Build Back Better Act. 
Mr. Speaker, those children who were 
living in poverty are coming out. We 
also need to make sure that those chil-
dren in rural America get their early 
pre-K that they need, and that is what 
Build Back Better will do. 
So the question I ask is simple: Do 
we want to keep an economy that 
serves only the wealthiest people and 
corporations? 
Or do we finally give our families a 
fair shot to truly thrive? 
As I said, we invest in the things we 
believe in. Well, we believe in our 
youngest children. We believe in our 
workers. We believe in the promise 
that lies in each of our communities. 
I am glad to be on the floor with my 
Progressive 
Caucus 
colleagues 
this 
evening to shine the light on the bril-
liance of the Build Back Better agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico for her leadership. I am very 
glad that she has emphasized the una-
nimity and the unity of Democrats as 
relates to all of our constituents, all 
Americans, whether we are in New 
Mexico, Texas, or whether, we are in 
New York, whether in Mississippi, Illi-
nois, California, whether we are up in 
the New England States or down the 
coast in the Carolinas and down to 
Florida and all in between, it is impor-
tant, again, to emphasize to the Amer-
ican people that this is about you. 
Breaking news. Each of these ele-
ments that we are fighting for—and we 
take no discomfort in you saying at 
the bus stop, while taking your child to 
school, what are they talking about? 
It is our responsibility to let you 
know what we are talking about and to 
let you know that the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus has been talking 
and working and talking and working. 
We now are at a point where we will 
say to you: We will not negotiate 
against ourselves. 
But we are the engine to get it done 
working with the Quad Caucus, the Tri 
Caucus, and the Democratic Caucus. 
So, Mr. Speaker, you have heard that 
there are numbers that may be dif-
ferent from $3.5 trillion of which I still 
stand on. But we are working to see 
how we can respond to the American 
people, and that is you have indicated 
that there is a framework that will 
change my life. I want to see it sooner 
than later. 
So here is where we are. There is the 
INVEST Act, though, we are talking 
tonight about Build Back Better. I 
want you to know that, Mr. Speaker, 
as some would say, it is on the table. It 
is on the table for broadband. It is on 
the table for high-speed rail. It is on 
the table for electric cars. It is on the 
table for the trials and tribulations of 
your commute where there is a pothole 
here or a freeway that is out of com-
mission or a bridge or a dam, it is 
there. So go home and be sure that we 
will have that framework. 
But then Build Back Better is what I 
want to conclude my remarks on 
today. We will provide you with the 
kind of quality of life that gives you 
more time with your children, that 
gives you better wages, that gives you 
climate change response, and gives 
your child a universal pre-K and kin-
dergarten to ensure that they are com-
petitive around the world; and, yes, 
Medicaid for those who never lived in 
States where they opted into the public 
option or expanded Medicaid. So if you 
are working every day, we want you to 
have health insurance, and on Medicare 
we want that hearing, we want those 
eyes, and we want dental to be part of 
your life. 
This is what is the bowl of fruit that 
is there for you. The next step as we 
work out for how these plans will be 
implemented is to get it done. My view 
is what I heard from a Member—I will 
give him credit—from Arizona. Put 
them together and let’s move once we 
organize and analyze the pieces of it. 
And I will just leave, Madam Manager, 
my comment on the table. 
Let us be meticulous and careful 
about what plans or what items can ac-
cept reduction because you don’t want 
something that does not work because 
you have reduced it in time or dollars. 
Let’s be meticulous, and that is what 
we are doing. And let’s make sure that 
we are meticulous in ensuring that the 
final bill is an impactful bill on lives in 
terms of years of how long the program 
lasts and in terms of dollars of how 
much impact it will have. 
We as the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus have been in the center and in 
the mix, and we will do the Nation’s 
bidding. We will do it right because we 
stand for the people of this Nation, and 
particularly those who cannot speak 
for themselves. That gives me pride. I 
am delighted to be here on the floor 
with the gentlewoman to ensure that 
those voices can be heard. 
I know working with the President 
we will get it done. Put it together, 
and let’s move. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so 
much for her words. I do think it is im-
portant to remember what it actually 
means for a family. 
In New Mexico, the average cost of 
infant care is $8,617. That makes New 
Mexico one of 33 States and D.C. where 
infant care is more expensive than col-
lege. The Build Back Better plan will 
limit that to 7 percent of your income. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON 
COLEMAN) on Build Back Better and 
what we have been fighting for and 
why we must get this done. 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding to me to be able to address 
something that I think is so critical 
and is such a once-in-a-lifetime oppor-
tunity. 
There are so many elements of this 
Build Back Better agenda that touch 
us from the very youngest to the oldest 
to the middle class to the working 
class to those unable to work and those 
at greatest need. 
I would like to speak on the aspects 
of the impact on our climate, the deci-
sions that we must make. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today because 
Congress has an opportunity to address 
the climate crisis, yet some Members 
still refuse to take this issue seriously. 
Climate catastrophe is no longer some 
distant threat. It is here, and it is now. 
We are witnessing it firsthand, yet we 
continue to ignore its very real and 
very deadly effects. 
This year we saw the single largest 
wildfire in California history. We saw 
temperatures surpass 100 degrees in the 
Pacific Northwest. And we saw Hurri-
cane Ida devastate my home State of 
New Jersey as well as many others. 
These tragedies were not inevitable. 
We could have avoided them had our 
country made it clear decades ago that 
climate change is not a political issue 
but a real issue that we need to re-
spond to. We now face the con-
sequences of our past and present deci-
sions. This could be our last chance to 
take long overdue action and spare our 
children from having to raise their 
children in an increasingly hostile 
world. 
The Build Back Better Act includes 
crucial climate investments. But these 
provisions are in jeopardy as some of 
our colleagues seek to eliminate them. 
The Build Back Better Act must in-
clude climate action. It is nonnego-
tiable. We need to pass the President’s 
entire agenda, and we need to pass it 
now. We might never get another 
chance. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for this opportunity to speak 
on such an important issue. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I would also note that when 
we adjust for the climate, we are also 
creating jobs. We anticipate there will 
be 763,000 green jobs available to our 
communities when we pass Build Back 
Better and address the climate crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative LEGER FERNANDEZ. We 
are excited to be here. This is a really 
important evening. 
Mr. Speaker, do you know why? 
It is because we are talking about 
why this is so important that we get 
Build Back Better accomplished. 
Like a great team that the Demo-
crats are—and I want to talk about 
that, if I may, with our chair’s permis-
sion. 
We are a team. I am frustrated with 
the media and anybody who is saying

that we are not a team right now. We 
are ready to go. Ninety-nine percent 
now, as of today, and I do mean that 
number, 99 percent of us are on the 
same page. We just have to get a little 
bit more done. So I am asking the 
media to report accurately. I am ask-
ing all of the Americans who are 
watching me to understand we are 
ready to go. We are a team. 
I want to talk about how big this 
package is. It is trillions of dollars. So 
think of it this way, Mr. Speaker, if 
two trillion-dollar companies came to-
gether, it would take probably 2 to 3 
years to integrate it. We are doing it in 
a matter of weeks and months. We are 
going to do it well and precisely, and 
we are going to get it done. So teams 
get things done in an orderly fashion, 
and we are going to get this done. 
But let me talk about something 
that is really frustrating to me and 
really irritating, and that is when folks 
talk about the labor shortage. The real 
issue is that we have a childcare short-
age. We have a healthcare shortage. We 
have an affordable housing shortage. 
We have shortage of affordable pre-K. 
And there is a shortage of folks being 
paid properly for hard work. 
This is particularly frustrating when 
I hear that there is a labor shortage 
and then our friends across the aisle 
block every single possible thing we 
can do to make that better and to 
boost our economy, so that is super 
frustrating for me. 
By the way, Mr. Speaker, you can’t 
say we have a labor shortage and then 
block immigration. It just doesn’t 
work that way. You can’t say immi-
grants are stealing jobs. It doesn’t 
work. It is common sense. It is math. 
So it doesn’t work. 
But let me say something else, Mr. 
Speaker, if we do things like expanding 
paid leave and medical leave, if we 
make sure that folks have access to 
childcare and have free childcare, guess 
what? 
Moms can get back to work because 
moms—let’s be honest about it—moms 
are frequently the primary caregiver. 
We can get them back to work. Mr. 
Speaker, 300,000 of our moms in this 
Nation have been forced to quit so they 
can take care of their kids. 
Someone mentioned something else 
that is astonishing, not that it is just 
300,000 people who have left the work-
force of the female nature, it is that in 
addition to that, about 70—when you 
take all of the sources of childcare, 
whether it is YMCA, moms and dads 
who are in other jobs and working 
three jobs at a time, or it is our school 
system, or just general daycare and 
childcare—about 70 percent of our 
childcare system was lost during the 
pandemic. So, of course, it is hard to 
get a break, because guess what? 
The reason we had this amazing 
package set up this way that we had 
roads and bridges that will be repaired, 
and broadband delivered, as well as 
childcare and healthcare and in-home 
healthcare and all of the things on the 
human infrastructure side, do you 
know why? Because when mom and dad 
go to fix a bridge, they need somebody 
to watch their kids all day. That is 
why this works so well together, and 
that is why we have to pass this. That 
is why we are doing this because it is a 
super practical thing to do. 
Every dollar in this package will get 
infused right back into the economy— 
right back. So this is really brilliant in 
every way. It is very practical, and it is 
founded within our great principles, 
our economic principles. 
And guess what, Mr. Speaker? It is 
founded in capitalism because supply 
and demand are working beautifully in 
this package, and we are going to get 
this done. 
I thank the gentlewoman for having 
us tonight. It is a joy to have my friend 
and everything she does. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I want to just touch on a few 
points. 
The 
gentlewoman 
mentioned 
the 
need for immigration. I would point 
out that when we pass our comprehen-
sive immigration reform, we would 
have a $1.4 trillion benefit to our econ-
omy. We need immigrants to help care 
for us. They help feed us. They are part 
of our communities, and the Build 
Back Better Act, as the House is look-
ing at it, includes immigration reform. 
Today, I was also reminded, during 
the remarks on something else, what 
today is. Today is sadly, and I say 
sadly, today is Latina Equal Pay Day. 
b 1645 
I have introduced a resolution to ac-
knowledge that it is Latina Equal Pay 
Day, and what that tells us is that it 
has taken this long, into the fall, into 
October, before a Latina earns the 
same as a White man. That is simply 
wrong. And the other thing we know is 
that Latinas in the recession, the 
shecession, that was caused by that 
pandemic, 20 percent unemployment, 
the childcare that my colleagues are 
talking about, that would help those 
women get back to work. That would 
help them when we make sure that 
they are also paid what they deserve 
for the work they do, taking care of 
our children, putting food on our 
plates, and just taking care of those we 
love. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY), somebody 
who I have always looked up to and 
learned much from. 
Ms. 
PRESSLEY. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my colleague for yielding and 
sister in service here, Congresswoman 
LEGER
FERNANDEZ, for convening us 
here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of 
every worker, every parent, and every 
caretaker that has questioned how 
they will make ends meet and keep 
food on the table for their families; the 
parent that has felt that pit in their 
stomach, the anxiousness as they look 
over monthly bills with the growing 
costs of rent and childcare; the front-
line worker, who is terrified to stay 
home sick and lose their job because of 
our Nation’s failure to provide paid 
leave; the family afraid of being dis-
placed from their home due to extreme 
weather and the existential threat of 
climate change; the student living in a 
transit desert with unreliable access to 
jobs, food, community; the daughter 
who is a caregiver to her parent who is 
one of 820,000 people on a wait list for 
much-needed home and community- 
based services; and our immigrant 
neighbor who has been unjustly denied 
a pathway to citizenship. 
Mr. Speaker, the Build Back Better 
Act will help us get one step closer to 
rejecting the unjust status quo and be-
ginning to build a recovery that cen-
ters on the people. As Angela Davis 
once said: ‘‘I am no longer accepting 
the things I cannot change. I am 
changing the things I can no longer ac-
cept.’’ 
Despite what some might argue, the 
needs of our communities go far be-
yond our Nation’s roads and bridges, 
and we must ensure that our policies 
and our investments reflect that re-
ality. Mr. Speaker, I refuse to choose 
between the union worker who builds 
our highways and the child worker who 
protections our babies and sets them 
on a pathway to a healthy life, to bring 
into bear their contributions to the 
world. I would ask every Member of 
Congress that they do the same. Reject 
the unjust, false binary choices that 
force us to choose between the liveli-
hoods and well-being of the two that 
pit community member against com-
munity member. We have the oppor-
tunity and responsibility to finally 
make 
universal 
paid 
leave, 
home 
healthcare, and universal access to 
quality and affordable childcare a re-
ality. 
In my district, in Massachusetts, it 
costs $21,000 per child for childcare. We 
have the opportunity and responsi-
bility to address climate change to 
combat our housing crisis, and to fi-
nally establish a pathway to citizen-
ship for millions of our immigrant 
workers. You know, those essential 
workers that you were all clapping for 
during the pandemic. 
They don’t need your applause. They 
need you to value more than just their 
labor, but their lives and the preserva-
tion of their families. We must rebuild 
stronger as a just Nation that takes 
care of its people. In order to truly 
build back better, we must truly ad-
dress both the human and physical in-
frastructure needs of our communities. 
This is responsive to the needs of the 
people. We have to focus on impact, ad-
vance policies that will be felt by all 
families. Leave no community behind. 
This is how we set forth a just recovery 
and chart a new course forward. 
This is the moment to repair genera-
tions of hurt and harm and what I 
would characterize as policy violence 
inflicted on our most vulnerable and 
neglected communities. This is our mo-
ment to legislate our values; to honor

the decisive mandate that we have 
from the people. This is our moment to 
make 
this 
Democratic 
majority— 
House, Senate, and White House—that 
that is more than a talking point that 
we are in the majority. We must affirm 
and codify once and for all. 
Infrastructure are those things that 
are essential to the functioning of our 
very society. Care is infrastructure. 
Housing is infrastructure. Climate jus-
tice is infrastructure. Paid leave is in-
frastructure. Disability justice is infra-
structure, and the list goes on. 
Here is what I know. There is no def-
icit of resource in this country, only a 
deficit of empathy and political cour-
age. Let’s pass the Build Back Better 
Act so that we can deliver for the com-
munities that for too long have been 
asked to wait. Justice delayed is jus-
tice denied. Our constituents deserve 
more. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so 
much for bringing to light and describ-
ing those individuals for whom we are 
working today, but it is they who are 
us. We are part of their communities 
and they have been telling us these sto-
ries and we are responding now because 
now is the time for us to act. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BARRAGA´ N), who co-
sponsored the resolution I spoke of ear-
lier for the Latina Equal Pay Day. We 
care for each other. That is why we 
look after each other. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I 
join my colleagues today in calling for 
Congress to pass President Biden’s en-
tire Build Back Better agenda. This is 
a plan that takes on the climate crisis 
and fights for environmental justice at 
a time when we have seen record heat 
waves, wildfires, and drought in Cali-
fornia and across the country. It in-
vests in things like the climate smart 
ports to invest in zero emissions tech-
nology that will reduce toxic air pollu-
tion in neighborhoods near our ports, 
like the communities of color that sur-
round the Port of Los Angeles in my 
Congressional District. 
The Build Back Better agenda we 
know will also invest in things like the 
construction of more than 2 million af-
fordable homes to address the rising 
housing costs that have hit Los Ange-
les so hard and across the country, 
with more than 41,000 suffering from 
homelessness. 
It is going to do things like lowering 
health insurance cost; invest in higher 
education to lower tuition for students 
at minority-serving institutions. It is 
going to cut taxes for families with 
children by extending the child tax 
credit and cutting poverty. How do we 
not invest in that? But today I want to 
focus more on climate because this is a 
crisis, and this is a threat that is hap-
pening as we speak. It is urgent. 
It is urgent that we act boldly to re-
spond to the threat of climate change 
and the climate investments in the 
Build Back Better Act which are crit-
ical to maintain, not cut. For example, 
there are two investments in the bill I 
have led on that are important for cli-
mate and environmental justice, cli-
mate smart ports. This includes a crit-
ical $3.5 billion investment to reduce 
air pollution at ports by providing 
grants and rebates for the purchase and 
installation of zero emissions tech-
nology. 
Nearly 40 percent of Americans live 
within 3 miles of a port and will benefit 
from these investments in clean air. In 
my district, the Port of Los Angeles is 
a major economic engine but it is also 
a major source of pollution. We have 
some of the worst air quality in the 
country and it disproportionately im-
pacts communities of color in South 
Los Angeles. For decades, my constitu-
ents have advocated for zero emission 
solutions. This $3.5 billion ports invest-
ment in the Build Back Better Act will 
deliver. It is a long-overdue investment 
in environmental justice, in climate 
action, in jobs. 
So I want to urge us to fight to keep 
these 
long-overdue 
investments 
in 
clean air for our port communities. En-
vironmental justice and climate justice 
grants, that is also in the Build Back 
Better agenda. There is a $5 billion in-
vestment in environmental and cli-
mate justice grants, by far the largest- 
ever amount that we have invested in 
this. 
Now, with this investment, we will 
empower environmental justice com-
munities to lead projects that reduce 
pollution and bring climate justice so-
lutions to communities hit first and 
worst by the climate crisis. This will 
mean climate-resilient solutions such 
as clean energy microgrids to keep the 
power 
on 
during 
extreme 
weather 
events like heat waves and hurricanes. 
It 
means 
the 
community 
solar 
projects that create local jobs and save 
money on electricity bills, like the re-
cent solar project in my district at the 
Wilmington Senior Center. It means 
green infrastructure to prevent flood-
ing and to protect communities from 
extreme heat. These long overdue in-
vestments will give environmental jus-
tice communities the resources to fight 
for a safe climate and clean environ-
ment. 
Of course, there are other invest-
ments, such as in-home care that will 
help provide care for our older Ameri-
cans and those with disabilities so they 
could stay in their homes and get the 
care that they need. It will provide for 
things like paid family and medical 
leave. Imagine you are a nurse at a 
hospital and you help deliver babies 
and all of a sudden you get cancer and 
you have no paid leave. 
How are you to go home and fight 
cancer, so that you can focus on that 
cancer fight instead of worrying about 
how you are going to pay the bills. 
That very thing happened to my sister 
just last November. She delivers babies 
at a military hospital, a Federal work-
er. You would think these are people 
we take care of, but this is happening 
across the country day in and day out. 
People have to go ask their colleagues 
and their coworkers to donate their 
leave and their time, and that is 
wrong. 
We need to invest in these and we 
have to fight to keep these priorities in 
the Build Back Better agenda. And it is 
time that these investments should be 
paid for by ensuring the wealthy and 
the corporations finally pay their fair 
share of taxes. Now is the time to 
make these once-in-a-generation in-
vestments in problems that have long 
been neglected. Now is the time to 
stand strong and deliver the promises 
we made to the American people. 
Let’s stand up for the people and the 
planet. Let’s meet the moment and 
pass the entire Build Back Better agen-
da. 
I want to thank the gentlewoman for 
leading this effort and thank the Pro-
gressive Caucus for being at the fore-
front of making sure that we are fight-
ing for the people. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Representative 
for her courage. She has raised the 
issues of environmental injustice since 
the day I met her. I know she raised 
them and she leads them in the Con-
gressional Hispanic Caucus, and she 
has now described what it means on 
the ground, what it means in terms of 
jobs, but also what it means in terms 
of the life that you live, the air that 
you breathe. Because we know that in 
our communities, our communities of 
color suffer from higher rates of asth-
ma. And when something like COVID 
comes about that ravages the lungs 
when they have already been damaged, 
it hurts. And that is why we saw the 
level of death and despair in the com-
munities of color, in the Native Amer-
ican communities and the Latino com-
munities. 
I would also point out that climate 
change is costly. When they don’t want 
to spend $3.7 trillion, or $2.5 trillion, 
let’s remember that failure to address 
climate change will lead to world in-
stability. It is estimated that we would 
lose $23 trillion, a $23 trillion impact 
on our economy, our world economy by 
failing to address this. 
I don’t want to pass over the impact 
in terms of the creating jobs for the 
people in our community, for the peo-
ple in America. We know that we are 
now coming back. The pandemic is 
hard. We are still pushing out of it. 
Today we heard some great jobs num-
bers. 290,000 is below what they had 
projected so we are feeling good. We 
know that the pandemic is something 
that we are working on, that this 
President has done such a great job 
working with Congress on that. 
But still, it is estimated that the 
Build Back Better agenda would create 
4 million jobs. That is 1.1 million 
caregiving jobs. That is not just a num-
ber. That is somebody that you are 
going to take your baby to. And you 
know that what we are going to do is 
make sure that that caregiver has the

kind of training that she needs or he 
needs to provide the best quality care; 
that because we are providing assist-
ance, that their caregiver is going to be 
receiving the kind of pay that she or he 
deserves because they are providing the 
most valuable thing to you. They are 
caring for the most precious resource, 
our children. And that is what Build 
Back Better will do. 
b 1700 
It will also create 556,000 manufac-
turing jobs, and those are going to be 
jobs with prevailing wages, good-pay-
ing jobs. That is what we need. When 
we talk about needing to bring manu-
facturing back, let’s grow it here. And 
if you are for manufacturing in Amer-
ica, you have got to be for the Build 
Back Better Act, because that is going 
to create a half billion jobs. That is a 
lot of jobs. 
But what does that job mean? It 
means that there is somebody who is 
going to go to work, who has a family, 
or wants to start a family, and is going 
to be able to buy a home. But we know 
that buying a home is hard. So the 
Build Back Better Act is going to pro-
vide assistance for those first-time 
home buyers. Because we know that 
the hardest thing for buying a home is 
having that down payment, and we 
have down payment assistance in the 
Build Back Better Act. That is what we 
are going to be bringing. 
We have looked at what are the dif-
ferent levers of our economy that make 
a difference that are infrastructure, 
that help a community thrive, not just 
survive. That is what is in the Build 
Back Better Act, because we want our 
communities to thrive, not just sur-
vive. 
Construction jobs, 312,000 construc-
tion jobs, doing the things that we 
need 
in 
America, 
building 
those 
bridges, building those health clinics, 
building those schools and those busi-
nesses. Because it takes all of that; it 
takes an investment in us. 
And we do pay for it. There is not a 
dime—this is not about debt, because it 
is all paid for and it is paid for first by 
going after those who fail to pay their 
taxes, even when due. So, tax cheats, 
yes, we are going to make you pay 
your taxes, because that is only fair. 
We are going to make those corpora-
tions who have paid less in taxes than 
my child’s schoolteacher, we are going 
to make them pay their fair share. 
Not a single family that is earning 
less than $450,000 a year—so if you are 
earning half a million dollars a year, 
then you will see a small increase in 
your taxes. 
But if any of you are outside listen-
ing to this and saying, what will it do 
to my tax burden? If you are earning 
less than a half a million dollars a 
year, you are going to be just fine. In 
fact, you are going to have a tax re-
fund, because we have the child tax 
credit in there. We are lowering taxes 
for working families and middle-class 
families. 
We know that when we invest in cre-
ating jobs that pay fair wages, that in-
clude benefits like healthcare, paid 
family and medical leave, and retire-
ment, we will help more people get 
those jobs and keep those jobs. Because 
when they are able to go home and help 
somebody they love who is ill in their 
family, then they don’t have to leave 
that job. That is what we should be 
caring about. 
So when is the time to get this done? 
As I say in my Nuevo Mexico, ahora es 
cuando; it is time now to get this done. 
Because that is right, that is good for 
our communities, it is good for Amer-
ica, it is good for our women, and it is 
good for our planet. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
DEMOCRATS’ PLAN TO PUT MASS 
AMNESTY 
IN 
RECONCILIATION 
PACKAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BABIN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, during my 
time this evening, my colleagues and I 
will be shedding light on the Demo-
crats’ illegal attempt to include mass 
amnesty in their multi-trillion-dollar 
spending package, their so-called Build 
Back Better bill. 
Frankly, this entire bill is a disaster. 
It will permanently cause labor short-
ages, crush small businesses, raise 
taxes, lower wages, and expand the 
very worst parts of our government. 
As one of the chairs of the House 
Border Security Caucus, a Texan, and 
simply as an American, I am stunned 
that in the middle of the worst border 
security crisis we have ever faced, Sen-
ate Democrats are using the reconcili-
ation process to try and grant mass 
amnesty to millions and millions of il-
legal aliens. 
We are up against more crises than 
any American has ever seen, too many 
to even keep track of anymore. But, 
folks, this is the worst one of all. Our 
open borders and the President’s dere-
liction of duty to secure our southern 
border will unquestionably affect every 
single American in this country, every 
single State, for generations to come. 
Let that sink in. 
My friends, this isn’t a talking point. 
It is a fact. History has shown us that 
amnesty erodes the integrity of our im-
migration system, and it breeds con-
tempt for the law on all sides. We are 
seeing this happening and unfolding be-
fore our eyes in living color. 
If we look back to 1986, which was the 
last time mass amnesty was granted, 
we have a clear view of what will hap-
pen if Biden and the Democrats push 
this plan through. Millions of jobs will 
be put at risk. We will see massive 
waves of new illegal immigration. It is 
happening as we speak. Our enemies 
will use this avenue to enter the 
United States and embed themselves 
into our society. 
Listen closely: Our society, our coun-
try, our neighbors, us—America is at 
stake. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
thank him for his leadership on this 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we learned 
that this year has broken all historical 
records for illegal immigration. The 
CBP arrested 1.7 million foreign na-
tionals illegally crossing our border 
this year. That is the entire population 
of the States of Alaska, Wyoming, and 
Vermont combined. And it is a Federal 
crime. It is a misdemeanor for the first 
offense. It is a felony for reentry. Yet, 
this administration is not only not 
prosecuting this crime; it is actively 
assisting and encouraging it. 
Today, the Attorney General, the of-
ficial responsible for prosecuting Fed-
eral crimes, could not even give us a 
ballpark guess of how many are actu-
ally being prosecuted, and, I suspect, 
because that number is zero. 
He couldn’t tell us what is being done 
to enforce the Federal law that forbids 
hiring illegals. He wasn’t aware of 
President Biden’s inauguration day 
order to Immigration and Customs En-
forcement not to faithfully execute the 
law. 
Now, I ask you, is it just possible 
that the administration’s refusal to en-
force our immigration law might just 
have something to do with the fact 
that our country is now being over-
whelmed by this unprecedented incur-
sion on our border? 
Ask any of the migrants. They will 
tell you the sole reason they are com-
ing is because of the Biden administra-
tion’s decision to open the border. 
Under Donald Trump’s leadership, they 
say they never would have considered 
making the trip, because we had 
achieved control of our border for the 
first time in a generation. 
Yet, on inauguration day, Mr. Biden 
reversed the Remain in Mexico policy, 
he ordered ICE not to enforce the law, 
and he abandoned the border wall. 
This Attorney General has no idea if 
his department is doing anything to 
enforce those immigration laws. Well, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
without 
immigration 
laws, we have no border; and if we have 
no border, then we have no country. 
Gallop estimates that based on their 
polling, there are 42 million people liv-
ing in poverty in South America and 
the Caribbean who intend to come to 
the United States now that they can.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5775 
October 21, 2021 
I would ask my fellow Democrats on 
the other the aisle, how are American 
workers helped by flooding the labor 
market with another wave of low-wage 
labor? How are our children helped by 
filling 
their 
classrooms 
with 
non- 
English-speaking classmates? How are 
our communities made safer by making 
it harder to deport criminal illegal 
aliens and gang members? How are our 
hospitals made more accessible by 
overwhelming emergency rooms with 
illegal immigrants demanding care? 
Mr. Speaker, no civilization in his-
tory has survived the mass migration 
that we are now watching move toward 
our border. And history is screaming 
this warning at us, that countries that 
either cannot or will not enforce their 
borders simply aren’t around very long. 
People ask me all the time now, how 
can this be happening to our country? 
Well, the answer is pretty simple, if 
you voted for the Democrats, this is ex-
actly what you voted for. And if you 
are surprised by that, you weren’t pay-
ing any attention. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK. 
That is so, so true. Arrests by Border 
Patrol are at the highest levels since 
1986. Ask yourself, what happened in 
1986, folks? Mass amnesty. This isn’t 
coincidental. This is cause and effect. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the good gentleman from Texas for 
yielding. 
Since January, we haven’t witnessed 
migration, Mr. Speaker, we have wit-
nessed an invasion; a 200 percent in-
crease over FY 2020, hundreds of thou-
sands of people coming across our bor-
der in July and August. 
You would think that amid what is 
definitively an open border crisis, re-
plete with numerous cases of sexual as-
sault, rape, human and drug traf-
ficking, proliferation of gang and car-
tel activity, that the United States 
would be working to stop criminal ac-
tivity and protect its citizens. Not this 
President, not this administration, not 
the Democratic Party in this House. 
They can’t be bothered. They keep on 
incentivizing this illegal invasion. 
You can check the tape. You can 
watch the film. It was then-Vice Presi-
dent Biden in 2015 who actually said it. 
He went on film and said he wants un-
bridled, unstopping immigration into 
this country. Now, I guess maybe peo-
ple thought he meant legal, but it is 
obviously illegal. 
It is crystal clear that no number of 
sexual assault victims, rape victims, 
drug overdose deaths, no number of 
human traffickers, can ever compare to 
the value of achieving the highest po-
litical objective of the left, which is 
creating legions of new voters. 
At the beginning of this reconcili-
ation process, we saw Democrats try to 
provide amnesty for literally millions 
of illegal aliens. What that means is 
saying it doesn’t matter if you break 
the law; we are just going to let it go. 
We are not going to prosecute that. Go 
ahead and break the law; the law 
doesn’t matter. We are going to forgive 
all of your crimes. 
When the Parliamentarian wouldn’t 
let them, they went to plan B. Yet 
more, millions of illegal immigrants, 
just by moving a date. Now, they are 
on plan C, amnesty, again, telling them 
to break our laws, to millions of illegal 
aliens, millions of people in our coun-
try illegally. 
And who is paying for it? American 
citizens are, every single day. 
Let me talk to you about the pay-
ment quickly. 
Jared Vargas, killed by an illegal im-
migrant in Mexico. Vargas’ body was 
then stuffed into a closet and left there 
for days. 
Ron Dasilva, murdered by a known 
gang member and an illegal immi-
grant. 
Two brothers, Daniel and Alfonso 
Mendez-Lopez, stabbed and killed by an 
illegal alien. 
In August of this year, a 43-year-old 
illegal alien was charged in Fredrick, 
Maryland, just a couple miles up from 
the street from here, for having a sex-
ual relationship with a 14-year-old. 
In August, also, a drunk driver and 
illegal alien struck and killed a 3-year- 
old in Flat Rock, North Carolina, as 
she was riding her tricycle. 
Those are American citizens, ladies 
and gentlemen. 
The people in this building take an 
oath to uphold and defend the Con-
stitution of American citizens, not ille-
gal aliens. 
Yet, on September 11, an Ecuadorian 
national, also here illegally, stabbed 
his wife to death and left behind their 
4-year-old child. 
And last Wednesday, a woman was 
harassed and groped for nearly 40 min-
utes before an illegal alien forcibly 
tore off her clothes and raped her on a 
train 
in 
Philadelphia. 
They 
went 
through 20 stops as up to 10 people 
watched and did absolutely nothing. 
Continuing to incentivize people to 
break the law by forgiving them for 
breaking all of our laws is going to 
continue to incentivize more people to 
break our laws and to come here in 
doing so. 
The American people deserve a gov-
ernment committed to their security. 
We must defeat this behemoth bill and 
this move towards amnesty. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
my good friend from Pennsylvania and 
thank him so much. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice 
to identifying this as the worst of the 
many crises created by this President. 
It is hard to identify, with so many 
things going in the wrong direction in 
our country, what is the worst crisis. 
But the absolute worst crisis we are 
facing is the crisis of the illegal inva-
sion at our southern border. 
I submit that never in the history of 
the country has our own President in-
tentionally done more to harm the 
United States than this President has 
done in the first 10 months of his ad-
ministration. 
Here we are on pace for over 2 million 
illegal aliens to cross our southern bor-
der. We have had over 200,000 a month 
for some 2 or 3 months in a row. But 
the good news is, we are going to stop 
that 200,000 pace this month. We are ex-
pected to smash it by setting an all- 
time record, with 400,000 illegal cross-
ings this month. 
b 1715 
I have been to the southern border 
three times already in my first 10 
months here in Congress, something 
that our President apparently has 
never done, Mr. Speaker, been to the 
southern border, and something our 
Vice President apparently has never 
done, been to the southern border. 
I have been there to meet with ranch-
ers, local law enforcement, folks who 
live at the border, and the Border Pa-
trol, who are living every day with 
what is happening at our southern bor-
der. 
Everything and everyone that crosses 
the southern border does so under the 
control of the Mexican cartels. There is 
no compassionate piece to our border 
situation, our immigration policy at 
our southern border, when you have 
drug trafficking, human trafficking, 
child trafficking, sex trafficking. Peo-
ple are coming through all kinds of ter-
rible conditions across our border. 
They are making every town a border 
town, every city a border town, every 
State a border State. 
I was there to witness illegals being 
placed on planes as we flew back from 
McAllen, Texas. They were being flown 
wherever they wanted around the coun-
try. 
When my colleague from Illinois 
asked the lady beside her to show her 
the paperwork from DHS, it said: You 
have to report at a date to be deter-
mined in Miami; we will get back in 
touch with you and have you report to 
a court date. No specific time, no spe-
cific way in how we are going to get 
control of that person. 
Get used to, American people, what 
we are seeing from the Haitian crisis at 
the border. The 15,000, 25,000 that as-
sembled most recently, they are not 
being stopped, not sent home, but dis-
tributed into the interior of our coun-
try. 
Now we find out they are even flying 
them during the night to places around 
the country at taxpayer expense. They 
are not trying to fix it. They are trying 
to hide it from the American people. 
They are willfully, intentionally, pur-
posefully facilitating this invasion of 
our southern border. 
You have to ask why. Why is this 
happening? Why would an administra-
tion, why would a majority party, the 
Democrat Party, support this invasion 
of our southern border? No borders.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5776 
October 21, 2021 
Why would they intentionally stop 
the already-funded completion of the 
southern border wall? Just because it 
was started by the previous President? 
Why would we pay contractors not to 
complete the wall? Why would we allow 
hundreds of thousands a month to 
come 
across 
our 
border 
unvetted? 
Whether it is because of a health issue 
or a criminal background, or whatever 
the reason is, why would they allow 
that to continue to happen? 
In the short run, it is because it is 
Democrat voters. In the long run, it is 
because they don’t believe in American 
exceptionalism. They don’t believe it is 
worth preserving the culture of our 
country, and they want to change our 
country to look like socialist Europe. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
POSEY). 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, the Presi-
dent’s theme, Build Back Better, just 
can’t pass the straight-face test. In re-
ality, it is more like demolish America 
faster. 
If you really think it builds America 
back better, your view of America is a 
lot different than most of the people I 
know. 
We grew up in an America where col-
lege professors taught students how to 
think, not what to think. 
We grew up in an America where you 
could express your thoughts on any 
subject without having the media 
collude with Big Tech to censor you 
through 
bullying, 
intimidation, 
or 
bogus so-called fact checks. 
We grew up in an America where par-
ents were encouraged to support the 
education of their children, not tar-
geted by the Department of Justice as 
domestic terrorists for telling the 
school board members that they think 
they are going in the wrong direction. 
We grew up in an America where im-
migrants, like most of our prede-
cessors, our ancestors, were welcomed 
if they came here legally. 
I can move to Mexico, but it would be 
impossible for me to become a Mexi-
can. I can move to Honduras, but I can 
never become Honduran. I can move to 
Somalia, but it would be impossible for 
me to become a Somalian. On and on it 
goes. 
But it is possible for people from 
other countries to come here and be-
come Americans. If they work hard and 
play by the rules, they can build a bet-
ter future for themselves and their 
families. They can achieve the Amer-
ican Dream. 
That is why people risk their lives, 
and some have died, trying to come to 
this country. No other countries with 
the kind of policies you are trying to 
force down the throat of Americans are 
like that. 
Yes, we lived in an America where 
most folks, unless they were plagued 
with 
affluenza, 
wokeness, 
entitlementitis, or Trump-phobia, be-
lieved they lived in the greatest and 
the freest country in the history of the 
world. 
Pre-COVID–19, we lived in an Amer-
ica with the lowest unemployment rate 
in decades, the lowest African-Amer-
ican and Hispanic unemployment rate 
since they began keeping records. 
An America that was energy inde-
pendent. 
An America with mostly fair elec-
tions. 
And an America with secure borders. 
Speaking about secure borders, let’s 
be clear. There is a crisis at the border, 
even though the President, the Vice 
President, and most of my colleagues 
across the aisle deny it. Coming into 
our country illegally does not make 
someone a legal immigrant any more 
than someone breaking into your house 
makes them one of your family. 
Most people know there is a dif-
ference between legal immigration and 
the illegal invasion that we are wit-
nessing right now. Proposed mass am-
nesty will only encourage others to 
come and try illegally. It is not hard to 
see where you are coming from. 
Based upon the false promise that he 
would unify America, President Biden 
got into the Oval Office, and my friends 
on the other side of the aisle gained a 
razor-thin majority in the House and 
Senate. But we all know, everybody 
knows, the unification promise was a 
lie, and their majority is going to be 
short-lived. So they must feel com-
pelled to rush through a radical agenda 
before the midterms. 
Now, people are understandably frus-
trated. Actually, they are very angry, 
and they are not going to sit back and 
take it much longer. Instead of the 
bogus Build Back Better plan and rec-
onciliation plan, you know what they 
want? They want the Democrats to 
help put America back where they 
found it and leave it the hell alone. 
Let’s go, Brandon. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, we are not 
against immigration. Most of us are 
the children of immigrants. My own 
daughter-in-law is a naturalized cit-
izen. But we have to do it the right 
way, and that is exactly what we are 
here to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, today I 
had a chance to ask some questions to 
Attorney General Garland and talk 
about what is happening at the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
What became very evident as we were 
having our question-and-answer today 
is that there are two sets of rules in 
America. It starts with our immigra-
tion system, where we are seeing peo-
ple come across our southern border, 
people being imported from all parts of 
the world, and they are getting free 
things from the American people. They 
get food stamps. They get free housing. 
They get all of those things that are 
free, while Americans have to pay for 
it. 
One of the questions I posed to the 
Attorney General is in regard to 
Facebook, and I think that very much 
highlights that there are two sets of 
rules in America. Recently, Facebook 
Vice President William Castleberry, 
said: ‘‘We do allow people to share in-
formation about how to enter a coun-
try illegally or request information 
about how to be smuggled.’’ 
Don’t you think an administration, 
in particular an Attorney General, 
would be concerned about that? 
Let me read to you U.S. Code title 8, 
subsection 1324. It makes it illegal for 
any person to knowingly encourage or 
induce an alien to come to, enter, or 
reside in the United States in violation 
of law or for individuals to aid or abet 
illegal entry. 
Yet, Facebook is allowed to do that. 
Are they a full-blown subsidiary of the 
Biden administration at this point? A 
person has to be very concerned over 
the last couple months that that is 
what is happening. 
The Attorney General would not 
make a commitment that he is going 
to investigate what is illegal activity 
from one of the largest companies in 
the United States of America and, 
clearly, one of the most powerful com-
panies in the United States of America. 
Also what came out of our hearing 
today, in my State is Fort McCoy, and 
we have been hearing stories coming 
out of Fort McCoy as a result of the 
mass migration perpetrated on the 
American people by the Biden adminis-
tration over the last 2 months. 
We found out very early on that 
there was no SIV process that was 
going on, no Special Immigrant Visa 
process. They were just being waived in 
on parole. 
We found out people could leave any 
time that they want to. We found out 
that 600 people were in quarantine with 
measles, COVID, and tuberculosis—just 
being allowed into our country. 
We found out that there were people 
being charged with violent crimes, a 
man raping two young boys in that 
camp at Fort McCoy. We found out 
that a man was beating his wife to 
death at Fort McCoy. We found out at 
Fort Bliss that a female soldier was 
being beaten by Afghan men. 
The American people wonder; they 
wonder why there are two sets of rules. 
My good friend and colleague, the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY), brought up the story in regard 
to the rape on the Philadelphia train 
that has horrified Americans. The as-
sailant was an illegal immigrant with 
prior convictions related to sexual 
abuse and drugs. He should have been 
deported. However, he was allowed to 
stay in the United States after an ap-
peals board determined that his prior 
sex crime was not serious enough to 
merit his removal. 
I asked the Justice Department, how 
serious does a sex crime have to be? 
These are the two sets of rules that 
we are seeing in America, and they are 
seeing it in a stark basis, with the 
mass migration that is coming into our 
country. 
We have an Attorney General that is 
being urged by school boards across the

country to entertain the use of the PA-
TRIOT Act on mothers and parents. We 
won’t use the PATRIOT Act on people 
who propose to come into the United 
States of America illegally, but we will 
use it on our own citizens? Something 
is wrong, America. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, House 
Democrats actually rejected the Re-
publican efforts to block amnesty for 
illegal aliens who are gang members or 
have gun charges or are sex offenders, 
as Mr. TIFFANY just said, or who have 
multiple DUI offenses. That is lunacy. 
All you can say is it is lunacy. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, the flow 
of illegal aliens into the United States 
is out of control. President Biden 
stopped building the wall, brought 
back the Obama-era catch-and-release 
policy, and rolled out an open borders 
agenda that is now devastating our 
country. 
More than 1.3 million illegal aliens 
have been apprehended at our border 
since January, and the men and women 
of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol 
are preparing for another surge of up to 
400,000 foreign nationals sometime this 
month. 
We must invest in border security 
now. But instead, Washington Demo-
crats are pushing a radical $5 trillion 
tax-and-spend package that will only 
make our borders and our border crisis 
worse. 
This package includes zero funding 
for border security and grants blanket 
amnesty to 10 million illegal aliens 
while providing them with $100 billion 
in taxpayer-funded benefits. 
The border crisis is real. Democrats’ 
far-left, socialist reconciliation pack-
age would only make it worse. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia, 
Mr. 
BUDDY CARTER. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, the massive reconciliation package 
that the House has been considering 
aims to fundamentally change our 
country. Normally, an effort this huge 
is considered over months and years in-
stead of the expedited timeline we are 
on now. 
That is why I am so glad my col-
leagues and I are taking this time to 
highlight how they intend to dramati-
cally change our country and the con-
sequences it will have. 
Today, we focus on perhaps the most 
immediate problem we are facing: ille-
gal immigration. This is happening as 
we speak. 
There were over 208,000 border appre-
hensions in August, a 317 percent in-
crease from the previous year. August 
was the second straight month with 
over 200,000 apprehensions. What is 
worse, this is not a new thing. 
To quote The Washington Post, of all 
places, ‘‘Illegal crossings began rising 
last year but skyrocketed in the 
months after President Biden took of-
fice.’’ 
There have been over 1.3 million ille-
gal border crossings under President 
Biden. The Department of Homeland 
Security warns us to be prepared for, 
next month, the possibility of 350,000 to 
400,000 illegal border apprehensions in 
October. 
The United States has never—never— 
recorded that number of illegal border 
apprehensions in a single month. 
b 1730 
So we now know that this has been a 
problem in the past. It is still a prob-
lem now. And it will even be worse in 
the future. 
And what are Democrats doing about 
it since they are in control? 
The Democrats have included a plan 
to grant amnesty for around eight mil-
lion illegal immigrants at a cost of $100 
billion over the next 10 years. All of 
that money to granting amnesty in-
stead of securing our border. 
I am a pharmacist by trade, so be-
lieve me when I say that the phrase 
‘‘an ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure’’ is an understatement 
here. 
We are already paying the price for 
illegal immigration that is harming 
our citizens. Over 6,000 pounds of dead-
ly fentanyl has been seized at the 
southern 
border 
since 
February, 
enough to kill every American four 
times over. 
That is dangerous. That is ludicrous. 
It is ridiculous. 
At least 160,000 illegal immigrants 
have been released in the U.S., often 
with little supervision by the Biden ad-
ministration since March. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle truly do not recognize what is 
happening in our country and the 
world. 
We need leadership to navigate these 
serious issues we face. 
Folks, I have been to the border sev-
eral times, and I can tell you it is a dis-
aster and a tragedy. Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS simply do not under-
stand the problem or how to fix it. 
However, I know that if Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS wanted to under-
stand the cause of the crisis at the bor-
der, they need look no further than the 
nearest mirror. 
Every State has become a border 
State, and rather than support our Bor-
der Patrol agents, the Biden adminis-
tration has neglected them and left our 
communities in danger. These people 
face threats in their lives, abuse and 
manipulation from cartels and worse. 
These people have been inundated with 
illegal aliens who have come across 
this border. 
It is irresponsible to not only neglect 
the safety of Americans, but this is a 
tragedy for those being misled that it 
is okay to come to America illegally. 
We cannot in good conscience con-
tinue policies that cause this much 
harm and damage to everyone in-
volved. Let’s stop this insanity. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Georgia for his input. 
I yield to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman, the co-chair of the Border 
Security Caucus for holding this Spe-
cial Order tonight. 
Just when we thought we had seen 
the worst of the Democrats’ socialist 
wish list with this $5 trillion reconcili-
ation plan, they manage to squeeze in 
yet another radical, dangerous, unnec-
essary provision. This time, it is effec-
tively creating an open U.S. border. 
So first, let’s set the scene. 
This summer and fall, we have seen 
record numbers of illegal border cross-
ings, reaching over 200,000 apprehen-
sions in July and August each. 
Earlier this week, U.S. authorities 
confirmed 1.7 million apprehensions in 
the fiscal year, the most ever recorded. 
More than 16,000 migrants tested 
positive for coronavirus and were re-
leased into the United States without 
vaccination requirements and without 
any trace of where they are traveling, 
who they were coming in contact with. 
This 16,000 was on top of the tens of 
thousands of migrants released into 
the interior of the country by Joe 
Biden. 
We no longer have detention centers 
at our borders, we have border distribu-
tion centers where we are sending peo-
ple all over this country. 
We now know that the Biden admin-
istration was covertly flying migrant 
children around the country. They 
didn’t want anyone to know. 
So my question for Joe Biden is this: 
How many children were flown out 
from the border and who is paying for 
it? The American people want to know. 
If the taxpayers are on the hook for 
these flights, we have the right to 
know. 
This is not normal. What we have on 
our hands is equivalent to an invasion 
of our southern border. For 9 months, 
the Biden administration has ignored 
the crisis, meanwhile it grows exponen-
tially worse. Biden stripped away all 
the policies that President Trump put 
in place to limit illegal crossings and 
to keep our borders safe, and now our 
Border Patrol has all but surrendered 
to the cartels. 
While all this is happening, Demo-
crats decided to exacerbate the crisis 
with these so-called reforms they are 
sneaking into the build back broke rec-
onciliation package at the last minute. 
Free college for illegal immigrants; en-
hanced child tax credits for illegal im-
migrants; amnesty for 10 million ille-
gal immigrants to the tune of $100 bil-
lion 
at 
taxpayers’ 
expense; 
incentivizing illegal entry by waiving 
provisions for inadmissibility, meaning 
that illegal immigrants will prac-
tically be guaranteed amnesty; they 
are removing convictions for illegal 
immigrants to increase their chance 
for amnesty. Let me say that again: 
The Federal Government is going to 
drop charges against drug traffickers 
and others who break our laws just so 
they don’t have to deport them. Insane. 
These policies and many more are 
being written behind closed doors with-
out the knowledge or input of the 
American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5778 
October 21, 2021 
Democrats who hold the majority in 
both the House and the Senate and 
thereby have a stranglehold on power 
in the United States, must take imme-
diate action to secure our border and 
protect our American people. Instead 
of putting Americans first, they are en-
suring that illegal immigrants are pro-
tected and prioritized above the Amer-
ican people, which is an absolute aban-
donment of their sworn duty as a Mem-
ber of Congress. 
Mr. BABIN. Well said. Thank you 
very much, Mr. HERN. I appreciated 
that. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Representative BABIN for 
yielding. 
The Biden socialist spending bill pro-
vides amnesty to eight million illegal 
immigrants, including illegal aliens 
who are active gang members, have 
convictions for sex crimes, and have 
multiple DUI offenses. 
The chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee actually said he was okay with 
allowing illegal immigrants to remain 
in our country even if they have 20 DUI 
convictions. Does that make our coun-
try more safe? 
The Biden-Harris open border policies 
have allowed over 200,000 illegal immi-
grants to cross our border each month 
with a caravan of 400,000 on the way. 
This is equal to the population of Min-
neapolis. They are about to cross our 
border in the next few weeks. 
Tragically, the Biden administration 
has allowed 125,000 children to be traf-
ficked into our country by criminal 
cartels. These children often face sex-
ual assaults by cartel predators who 
are only able to operate because the 
Biden administration eliminated re-
main in Mexico and brought back catch 
and release. 
The invasion at our border plus am-
nesty is truly the end of our country as 
we know it. 
Americans oppose mass amnesty for 
illegal immigrants. We want strong 
borders and a border wall. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mrs. MILLER. We really appreciate 
that. 
For those of you who don’t know, one 
of the leaders of the 1993 World Trade 
Center bombing was legalized through 
the 1986 amnesty by falsely claiming 
that he was a seasonal worker. After 
receiving amnesty, he traveled back 
and forth to Afghanistan and Pakistan 
to receive terrorist training. There is 
no reason to believe that terrorists 
would not once again take full advan-
tage of amnesty to hurt us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN), the 
highest ranking military officer to 
serve in the House of Representatives. 
MR. 
BERGMAN: 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my friend from Texas for yield-
ing and for leading tonight’s Special 
Order. 
How do you apply an adequate objec-
tive to the shocking, clueless attempt 
to jam amnesty for eight million ille-
gal immigrants into this Democrat- 
owned, 
Democrat-grown, 
Democrat- 
processed 
multitrillion-dollar 
rec-
onciliation bill? Again, it is a complete 
sham. 
I think it is clear to most Americans 
why illegal immigration is illegal—it 
kind of sounds like I am repeating 
words here, but it is still illegal—and 
why any nation and our Nation needs 
borders. 
People aren’t trying to break out of 
the United States of America. Let’s be 
clear why we are the greatest country 
in the world. Because we built it. No-
body else did. 
The Democrats running our country 
today, however, are defying logic and 
the rule of law. 
They are hosting an open border pol-
icy on the front end while simulta-
neously proposing a mass legalization 
policy on the back end. 
The amnesty policy before us is the 
opposite of a solution. 
We need real solutions, like when we 
had a wall being built and border secu-
rity policies that worked. 
I am here tonight because we need to 
stop this illegal activity on the south-
ern border and make sure it is not re-
warded by this shameful sham bill. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
what the gentleman said. 
While the exact number of the mil-
lions of illegal aliens potentially eligi-
ble for amnesty is very fluid, data 
shows that historically each immi-
grant to the United States sponsors an 
average of 3.45 additional family mem-
bers for green cards. So theoretically, 
if the estimated 13 million illegal 
aliens currently here in the United 
States were given lawful status and 
sponsored green cards for three or four 
family members, 43 million—let me re-
peat that, 43 million—new immigrants 
would be coming in. This is astounding 
data. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The topic for tonight, and rightfully 
so—when we look at the $3.5 trillion 
bill with so many things that will per-
manently change America—is some of 
the most radical immigration provi-
sions we have ever seen. Predictions by 
the Democrats, themselves, will be 
that they will affect 9 to 12 million 
more people in this country who are 
not here legally and will ultimately 
lead to a huge change in America. 
This has nothing to do with legal im-
migration. Every year in this country 
about 800,000 people are sworn in as 
citizens. They are appropriately vetted, 
they have jobs, they are not commit-
ting crimes, and they are added to our 
citizenry. 
I am talking about the people who 
are coming across the border claiming 
they want asylum. 
I was down at the border last week to 
have a look at some of these people 
who apparently people feel will make 
good citizens. 
One of the first things you notice, at 
least in the Yuma sector in Arizona, is 
you look at the path of people coming 
here, the path is littered with identi-
fication that is being thrown away by 
people who want to get in this country. 
Now, why would people throw away 
identification? Normally you keep your 
identification because you have noth-
ing to fear. If you are throwing the 
identification on the ground, it means 
you are creating a new identity when 
you come here. These are the type of 
people that under this bill are eventu-
ally going to work their way to become 
American citizens. 
And it is not surprising. The Demo-
cratic Party in many other ways has 
made it clear the type of people we 
want to get are not the type of people 
normally sworn in. 
Look at all the sanctuary cities or 
sanctuary counties around the country. 
And by having a sanctuary city or a 
sanctuary county to me it is an invita-
tion to say you are going to go on pub-
lic assistance. 
We are sending in children without 
their parents. People normally would 
like to have an intact family, but what 
we are doing in this bill is we are going 
to encourage more parents to send 
their underage children to the United 
States not knowing what will happen 
to them. 
Under this bill as the word gets out 
that the United States does not care 
about enforcing laws and more people 
come here, it will inevitably mean 
more illegal drugs in the country under 
this bill. And we are now in a position 
in which over 90,000 Americans are al-
ready dying every year primarily of 
COVID but also from other drugs that 
pass through the border. 
The only thing in this bill that you 
would expect to have—given the $3.5 
trillion number, you would expect to 
have maybe more money spent that is 
immigration related—is more border 
patrol agents. But as in their regular 
budget, that is not something that 
they feel we need more of. 
So, again, I beg the American people. 
I know it is easy to get lost among the 
$3.5 trillion in spending, but I beg the 
American people to rise up against this 
bill because of the massive green light 
for illegal immigration that is going to 
come if it passes. 
b 1745 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman, (Mr. GROTHMAN). So true. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN), 
my colleague. 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for hav-
ing this Special Order. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, I come be-
fore this Chamber to ask when will this 
administration address the ever-grow-
ing crisis at our southern border. 
Every day that passes, from sunup to 
sundown, our Nation’s immigration 
laws are being violated by thousands of 
illegal border crossers. For the life of

me, I don’t understand why—and let 
me say this again—I don’t understand 
why our Commander in Chief refuses to 
go and see the mess that he and his 
open border politics have created. 
But I have seen this crisis myself so 
let me paint him a picture. And I am 
going to use a paint brush with some 
facts. 
In fiscal year 2020, 458,000 illegal 
aliens were apprehended at our south-
ern border; that was in 2020. Fast for-
ward to fiscal year 2021, under Presi-
dent Biden’s ‘‘leadership,’’ the number 
skyrocketed to 1.7 million. 
And that is not a crisis? That doesn’t 
even warrant a ‘‘pick your head up and 
open your eyes and go down to the bor-
der.’’ From 458,000 to 1.7 million, I 
would hate to see what a crisis would 
look like under his watch. 
Last month, more than 12,000 illegal 
aliens from Haiti squatted under a 
bridge until President Biden’s Depart-
ment of Homeland Security began 
moving those illegal aliens into the in-
terior of our country. 
The problem doesn’t stop with people 
coming in illegally. Illegal drugs from 
the border are coming to a town near 
you. And we are already seeing it. 
Again, let me use some facts: 
In fiscal year 2021, Border Patrol 
agents at the southwest border seized 
900 pounds of fentanyl. That is what 
they seized. Doing the math, that is 
enough to kill nearly 200 million peo-
ple. That is nearly two-thirds of the 
country. 
To all of my colleagues, I beg of you, 
I implore you, we must fix this crisis at 
the border, but you can’t fix a problem 
you don’t think exists. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman, (Mrs. MCCLAIN). I really 
appreciate it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DONALDS), my friend. 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my distinguished colleague from the 
Lone Star State, Dr. Babin. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been on this floor 
already a couple times this week talk-
ing about the 4.3 trillion or the 3.5 tril-
lion—or maybe what they are saying 
on CNN now—maybe $2 trillion. Who 
knows how many trillions of dollars is 
in this bill. But I am here today to 
speak against a provision that I find to 
be just as disastrous as some of the 
others, including the one that will 
allow the IRS into the bank accounts 
of every American. 
It is a provision in this bill that al-
lows for mass amnesty through budget 
reconciliation. Something, by the way, 
that the Senate Parliamentarian has 
already said is out of order but it is 
still in the House provision. It is im-
portant that the American people un-
derstand this. 
How disastrous of a policy is that? It 
is because those are the things that the 
Vice President of the United States 
said she was looking for. She was look-
ing for root causes. Well, here is the 
number one root cause. When this body 
decides to green-light in a package 
that there will be mass amnesty in a 
spending bill, that tells the drug car-
tels, it tells the coyotes, it tells any-
body who has been waiting south of our 
border to emigrate into the United 
States illegally to come on down, be-
cause they are the next contestant. 
When you do something like that, 
you are giving a signal to the entire 
world that we do not take our own bor-
der seriously. There has been a fight in 
this Chamber to complete border wall 
construction for 30 years but what peo-
ple need to understand is that the num-
ber one entity that has been asking for 
a border wall is Border Patrol them-
selves. 
You see, the American people will 
never build walls in their house with 
wide open gaps. That is just silly. But 
in Congress, we think that is okay. 
That is why Congress has not taken 
their responsibility serious enough to 
complete the border wall, so Border Pa-
trol has every tool at their disposal to 
secure our southern border. 
Immigration is critical to any na-
tion, let alone a nation like ours. We 
need legal immigration in our country, 
but it must be legal. It cannot be out of 
control. And what is in this budget rec-
onciliation bill would allow for the 
most reckless and the most wide open 
and the most insecure border our coun-
try has ever seen. And that is actually 
something that our Congress needs to 
not do. 
We need to stand up for our border 
agents and the American people. We 
need to secure our southern border and 
take that provision out of this bill, 
amongst others. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman (Mr. DONALDS). I appreciate 
that very much. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD), my 
friend. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, amnesty is not infra-
structure, and I know this seems obvi-
ous to many Americans, but I know for 
some of my colleagues they are trying 
to redefine. And what is tucked away 
right now in the $5.5 trillion spending 
package are provisions that would give 
amnesty to over a million illegal immi-
grants. 
I have been to the border. Some of 
my colleagues that I have been able to 
visit the border with are here this 
evening. 
Eye-opening experiences in McAllen, 
Texas. And in the travel back to Hous-
ton to fly back to Wisconsin, I saw a 
plane that was full of refugees with 
brown envelopes and destinations writ-
ten in black magic marker. And I just 
wondered who could possibly be spon-
soring all of these individuals and 
where would they end up. 
We know that there is 11 million ille-
gal immigrants living in the U.S. 
today. Not only does this provision 
pose a risk to national security, but 
studies have found that it is going to 
cost us trillions of dollars in payouts in 
increased entitlement benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, what I witnessed, and I 
think what I have experienced back in 
Wisconsin, has put us in a position 
where unless we act now, unless we act 
swiftly to get a handle on the southern 
border, we will no longer have the bor-
ders that bind us Americans. And I 
don’t think the urgency could be any 
more clear and any more in front of us 
right now. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
FITZGERALD. I appreciate that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW), my 
friend and colleague, and a dentist as 
well. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend and fellow dentist for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise that 
Democrats, led by President Joe Biden, 
are abusing the budget reconciliation 
process to pass an extremely partisan, 
socialist spending spree that will fun-
damentally change our Nation forever. 
One of their many dangerous provi-
sions is to provide amnesty to more 
than 8 million illegal immigrants. And 
for those that didn’t quite hear me or 
didn’t quite believe it, 8 million illegal 
immigrants. Even though the Senate 
Parliamentarian already ruled that to 
do so would violate the rules of the rec-
onciliation process. 
Additionally, the majority party out-
right rejected offers from Republicans 
to bar gang members, sex offenders, 
and other violent criminals from re-
ceiving amnesty. As I have stated be-
fore, literally you have to believe that 
many Democrats are actively trying to 
destroy our great Nation. 
With record-breaking levels of mi-
grant crossings, drug smuggling, and 
child trafficking, the majority is still 
somehow finding new ways to weaken 
and undermine our great America. Let 
me be clear to you. I love immigrants. 
America needs immigrants, and immi-
grants need America. But it must be 
done legally. We are a nation of laws, 
and those who enter America must go 
through our legal process. 
True story, just the other day, I re-
ceived a call from one of my constitu-
ents who emigrated to the United 
States from Eastern Europe. With her 
husband, she went through America’s 
legal immigration process because she 
loves our country and she respects our 
country. She called me, literally cry-
ing in utter disbelief with our current 
immigration situation and also the 
current state of affairs in the United 
States of America. 
She came to the United States, 
worked hard as a hotel employee, and 
eventually saved enough money by 
working double shifts to purchase her 
own business with her husband. That is 
the America that I know. That is the 
America that we all love; not this reck-
less concept of open borders with zero 
accountability. 
For how long are Democrats going to 
pursue these radical ideas. Is this real-
ly what America is becoming? A place 
where people can uncontrollably flow

through our borders and do whatever 
they want? Dammit, that is wrong. 
Think about our communities. Think 
about our children. Think about our 
grandchildren, who are going to have 
to suffer the consequences of these rad-
ical Democratic policies. They have 
proven that not only do they not care 
about our institutions, but they do not 
care about our laws or protecting our 
great America. God help us. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. 
VAN DREW. I appreciate it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), my friend, 
and also fellow cochair of the House 
Border Security Caucus. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman (Mr. BABIN), my colleague 
on the House Border Security Caucus. 
Mr. Speaker, you have heard a lot 
about numbers today. I want to just 
tell you a little bit about some of the 
faces and individuals. I have been from 
the Rio Grande Valley to San Diego, 
and back again, this year. I get down 
to the border incredibly often; just 
down again last week, down two weeks 
before that, down a few weeks before 
that. And that is kind of way I live, be-
cause I live in Arizona and it is af-
fected and it is impacted. 
I was down in RGV, the Rio Grande 
Valley, and you can go there in the 
area of La Jolla. And you sit at the 
river, the Rio Grande River runs, and 
you can go and you wait—this little 
fork in the road. We parked the car. I 
had a CBP agent with me, had a couple 
Members of Congress. It is nighttime. 
We are looking out and we see about 40 
people literally emerging from the 
river. They are dressed great. 
But you know what? Most of them 
are kids under age 14, I would guess. A 
little girl 7 years old, she is with her 
brother, 5. There is no mom. There is 
no dad. There is no aunt or uncle. 
There is no one there to take care of 
them. The coyote brought them across 
the river and deposited them. 
Do you know what would happen in 
the United States for us who are citi-
zens, who are legally here, if we had a 
4-, 5-, 6-, 7-year-old child and we put 
that child in the hands of a criminally- 
violent person? That is what a coyote 
is; they are working for the cartels. 
And we sewed into their britches a 
name and a phone number, or a city. 
We put that child there; and then we 
were up in Detroit, or LA, or Phoenix. 
And that coyote, the person we gave 
that child to, then turned the child 
over to the Border Patrol to reunite 
with us. 
Upon reunification, we would be 
charged with child abuse. But our gov-
ernment is the logistics arm of the car-
tel, and we don’t do that. We reunite 
that child and we allow that mom and 
that child to remain in the United 
States of America and we don’t bring 
criminal charges. And we don’t remove 
from this country. Instead, we release 
with all the benefits of our social wel-
fare safety net, our education system, 
our healthcare, the free phones, the 
housing—all of that. That is what we 
do. 
And down in Yuma, just recently, 
how about this, I am standing there 
with some of my friends. We are stand-
ing literally next to the fence. But the 
fence ends, and there is a space of sev-
eral hundred yards. And literally, we 
are getting pictures of us standing in 
front of this hole in the fence. 
Here comes a fellow. He is walking 
up, and so we stop and talk to him.

Where are you from? Cuba. Where 
were you before that? I came from Rus-
sia. I went from Cuba to Russian and 
then I went to Spain and then to 
France and then to Mexico City, and 
then I got myself to Mexicali. I took a 
bus from Mexicali to Yuma—actually, 
Los Algodones, which is right across 
the border, and he walks dry across the 
dregs of that point of the Colorado 
River. 
I say: What are you doing here? I 
want to be in America. He wanted to be 
an American. 
We say: Well, why don’t you sit right 
here? There is water. There is a station 
where you can clean yourself up a little 
bit. Border Patrol is going to be along 
in just a second. 
That person is not an economic ref-
ugee. There is no credible fear. He is 
traveling and wants to come to the 
United States of America. 
Do you know what is going to happen 
to him if they don’t title 42 him, which 
they are not doing many title 42s any-
more? He is probably already in the 
country somewhere. That is where that 
fellow is. He was an engaging fellow, 
but, nonetheless, illegally in this coun-
try. 
Mr. BABIN. I thank my good friend 
from Arizona. Mr. Speaker, how much 
time do I have left? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 90 seconds re-
maining. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friends for bringing attention to this 
unbelievably important issue. Every 
one of us, as well as my colleagues who 
couldn’t be here tonight, could talk 
about this crisis for days. Since our 
time is limited, I want to close with 
this. 
Our very existence as a democratic 
republic, as a nation, hangs in the bal-
ance. The overwhelming majority of 
Americans reject the idea of mass am-
nesty. The border crisis, including the 
abuse, assault, drug trafficking, abduc-
tion, danger, murder, fraud, and death 
that comes along with it will only get 
worse. 
We cannot afford to risk the lives of 
migrants or Americans by granting a 
mass amnesty. We will continue to 
fight against this for as long as we 
need to. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
CRISIS AT SOUTHERN BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Texas for holding this time 
with my colleagues to talk about what 
is going on at our southern border and 
talk about how important it is that we 
do something about it. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
Arizona for his steadfast leadership on 
border issues. I know that the gen-
tleman was squeezing in some time 
there, and I am happy to engage in col-
loquy or yield him some time to con-
tinue to talk about this important 
issue, if he would like. 
One thing that I noticed you were 
saying in the time from my friend from 
Texas, you were talking about being 
down at the border, being next to the 
fence, a fence that works, by the way, 
where it is up, and then there is a hole 
or an unfinished fence or where the 
fence ends. 
I noticed that my friend from Ari-
zona was recently standing next to a 
large pile of metal, steel. I wondered if 
he might describe for the American 
people what you were standing next to 
so they can understand what is actu-
ally happening. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I was standing next to 
many piles—I couldn’t even fit them 
into the camera shot—of bollard fenc-
ing panels taller than me, $2 million 
worth of those bollard fences right 
there. 
A little further down from where we 
were, there is another set of bollard 
fencing, but they aren’t welded to-
gether yet. They are not panels yet. 
They are getting stolen, by the way. 
Where we were was by the temporary 
headquarters of the contractors who 
were there to put up the fence. You 
know what? They keep going to work 
every day. You know why they keep 
going to work every day? They got a 
contract, and they are getting paid to 
go there. But they can’t put the fence 
up because President Biden says you 
can’t put the fence up. 
Mr. ROY. I think there is a theme for 
this administration, and this adminis-
tration’s theme is paying people not to 
work. In this case, they are paying peo-
ple not to build a fence, despite the 
fact that the taxpayers of this country 
have paid for a fence that would actu-
ally do the job of stopping the flow of 
people who want to come across this 
country and, in many cases, bringing 
fentanyl, bringing dangerous narcotics, 
harming the American people, and 
harming themselves. Yet, we can solve 
the problem but refuse to. 
Mr. BIGGS. That is exactly right. 
Think about this, too. It is inhumane, 
right, because we entice people to come 
here, and we know that the cartels,

October 21, 2021 
they control. I can’t emphasize this 
enough. I was startled when I heard 
this. The cartels control every person 
coming across the border. 
Let me tell you what that fellow 
from Cuba, the Cuban national, said to 
me. He said: Look, I will wait here for 
the Border Patrol to come pick me up. 
Will I be molested while I wait? 
Think of that. What kind of country 
are we that we entice people to come 
here, and they put themselves in the 
hands of some of the most ruthless 
criminal gangsters ever. 
There are two internecine wars going 
on between the Gulf Cartel and the 
Sinaloa Cartel right now. The brutality 
is phenomenal. It helps you to know 
that they are not humane. These peo-
ple that are coming over are paying 
$700 in the Haitian group, most $4,000 
to $7,000. They are putting their lives 
in the hands of these very violent 
criminals. 
Mr. ROY. Would it surprise the gen-
tleman from Arizona that one of the 
reasons that the Haitians got a dif-
ferent deal was they came up through 
Del Rio and they did so purposefully? 
Why did they target Del Rio, you 
might ask? 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are clearly sitting over here 
inquisitive, with their interest of what 
is happening at the border. While they 
continue to advance policies that cre-
ate an open border, they don’t seem to 
actually care about the open border be-
cause I haven’t seen any of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
when I go down to the border. 
In fact, the last one I remember 
going down to the border was my col-
league from New York who went down 
wearing a pantsuit, standing outside of 
a fence doing a photo-op, crying about 
kids in cages—cages created by the 
Democratic administration, indeed, to 
try to deal with the fact that we had so 
many people coming in across the bor-
der. Yet, it was fake. It was staged. 
And then they lied about kids drinking 
out of toilets. 
The actual reality on the ground at 
the border is dead migrants. I am sure 
my friend from Arizona knows of dead 
migrants in Arizona because we got 
dead migrants in Texas. So my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who pat themselves on the back for 
how compassionate they are about mi-
grants and Brown people, go talk to 
the Brown people in south Texas about 
what they are seeing and what they are 
finding. Talk to the ranchers. 
I would love to hear if you have simi-
lar experiences. The ranchers who find 
a migrant either dead or dying from 
the heat and exhaustion, seek to get 
them water, call 911 to get them help, 
try to help their fellow human being. 
They are dealing with that. 
A hundred bodies in Brooks County, 
Texas, stacking up this year. Body 
trailers. The sheriff down there has to 
deal with this. $3,000 per body for au-
topsy. $5,000 per body for burial be-
cause they can’t get the families. 
Where are my colleagues? Where are 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle? Going around trumpeting and 
talking about how their policies of 
open borders are great for migrants. 
Well, say that to the dead migrants. 
I assume my colleague from Arizona 
has seen similar stories. 
Mr. BIGGS. That is correct. We have 
seen it all along the border, whether it 
is Arizona, Texas, the New Mexico 
boot, California. The heat is so great, 
except for right there at San Diego, but 
it is even hot there. When it gets 120 
degrees in the desert and they are com-
ing across, they got one gallon of water 
that they got somewhere along the 
pike, and that is it. It is unrelenting, 
unremitting heat. We see this. 
Here is another question. You got it 
in Del Rio? 
Mr. ROY. Yes. 
Mr. BIGGS. And that was not or-
ganic? 
Mr. ROY. No. 
Mr. BIGGS. It was organized. It was 
organized. 
Down in southern Mexico right now, 
you have a group of 95,000-plus forming 
up, mostly Haitians forming up, wait-
ing. They have announced that this 
Sunday is their departure date. We 
think a good share is going to go to 
Yuma this time because we have a 7- 
mile gap in our fencing down there. 
Mr. ROY. As my friend from Arizona 
knows full well, the cause of this is the 
purposeful and willful disregard for en-
forcing the laws of the United States at 
our border. Our laws actually require 
the enforcement of the law at the bor-
der. 
The Secretary of Homeland Security 
is willfully disregarding, for example, 
as my friend knows, the Secure Fence 
Act, which among its provisions passed 
in this body on this floor is to guar-
antee that we have operational control 
of the border. That is law. 
The Secretary of Homeland Security 
literally stood in Del Rio, looking at 
individuals standing in America, going 
back across the Rio Grande and buying 
tacos, bringing them back over and 
selling them to Haitians on American 
soil. He saw it with his own eyes. He 
turned to the cameras, and said: Our 
border is secure. 
He looked at the American people 
and lied, just like the White House 
press secretary lied when she said Bor-
der Patrol agents were whipping Hai-
tians when what they were doing was 
actually trying to do their job that the 
President of the United States and the 
Secretary of Homeland Security is pur-
posefully, willfully trying to deny 
them the ability to do. 
Would my friend agree? 
Mr. BIGGS. I agree with you 100 per-
cent. If they would enforce our law, we 
wouldn’t need to be standing here. We 
had the Attorney General today come 
in. 
Mr. ROY. We did. 
Mr. BIGGS. We asked him some 
pointed questions. How many prosecu-
tions? Is it still illegal? Yes, it is still 
illegal to come into the country. 
Are you prosecuting anybody? Well, I 
suspect the answer is, no, they are not 
prosecuting anybody, but they are not 
detaining anybody either. The law, 
under title 8, says you must detain un-
less there is some legal exemption from 
detention. 
The vast majority that are coming 
across, the Haitians—we heard about 
10,000 
to 
12,000 
that 
Secretary 
Mayorkas admitted to. They only re-
moved 2,000, and the real number was 
between 26,000 and 30,000 that actually 
flowed through Del Rio, Mr. ROY. 
What happened to the other 20-some- 
odd thousand? Well, they are now re-
leased into the interior of the United 
States of America. That is what is hap-
pening. This catch and release program 
is another contravention of our law. 
Mr. ROY. Isn’t it a perversion of our 
law for the administration to tell the 
world: Come to the United States. 
Claim asylum. 
Let’s be clear. This is what is hap-
pening almost explicitly. The adminis-
tration is saying to the world: Come to 
the border of the United States. Claim 
asylum. We know and you know and 
every everybody knows well over 90 
percent of you do not have a valid 
claim for asylum. 
They are seeking economic benefit. 
They are seeking jobs. God bless them. 
I would, too. I have no problem with 
their desire to come here. But the rule 
of law matters. 
You have an administration saying: 
Come on here. Claim asylum. What we 
will do is we will parole you. What does 
parole mean? Oh, well, you can just 
come in here and you can work. You 
can have a job. You can get benefits. 
And we will just pretend you are going 
to come back under notice to appear or 
notice to report. Or we are not going to 
parole you. We are just going to send 
you out, and say, notice to appear or 
notice to report. Oh, by the way, we 
might just release you and not give 
you a notice to appear or notice to re-
port, and we just are going to let those 
numbers flow into the United States of 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, 1.7 million apprehen-
sions this year; 300,000 or 400,000 got- 
aways this year; hundreds of dead mi-
grants along the Rio Grande. 
Where are my colleagues? Where are 
they? They have a duty under the Con-
stitution, a sworn oath to uphold the 
Constitution to enforce the laws of the 
United States, and the administration. 
Here in Congress, this Chamber is MIA 
in holding the administration account-
able to do their job, and I would like to 
know why. 
Mr. BIGGS. When you say that, I am 
reminded of the surge of 2019. That 
surge in 2019 happened. I know you 
went down to the border multiple 
times. 
Mr. ROY. Yes. 
Mr. BIGGS. I went down to the bor-
der multiple times. I took codels down 
to the border so folks could see how 
bad it was. That was my President. 
Mr. ROY. Yes.

October 21, 2021 
Mr. BIGGS. You know what? He was 
trying to enact policies to stop that. 
They brought lawsuits to prevent stop-
ping that. 
Now that their administration has 
basically adopted an open borders pol-
icy, a dangerous policy for the people 
coming across, a national security 
issue for us, a national security threat 
for us, it is crickets? 
Mr. ROY. What were those policies 
that President Trump and his adminis-
tration put in place to actually secure 
the borders of the United States in 
2019? 
Mr. BIGGS. There are several. Title 
42 came along a little bit later, though. 
The most effective were the remain in 
Mexico policy and the agreements with 
the Northern Triangle states. There 
were no incentives in these care pack-
ages that came along of $1,400 every 
time anybody came in illegally. 
He started building the fence. He 
stopped the catch and release. He 
ramped up the due process speed. He 
tried to get those folks with the false 
asylum claims in, get them due proc-
ess, and get them removed. He was ac-
tually removing people who had re-
moval orders. 
We got 1.2 million people who had 
due process with removal orders in this 
country today, and this administration 
has told the ICE officers: Don’t go out 
and find them. Don’t enforce those re-
movals. 
b 1815 
Those policies were actually work-
ing, and title 42 when that came in, 
that finished it off. 
But do you know what you had most 
of all, Mr. Speaker? 
You had a President who said: Do not 
come, you are not welcome. 
Mr. ROY. Right. You are not wel-
come to come here illegally, and you 
are not welcome to flout our laws. You 
are welcome to come here and follow 
our laws that we have in place for peo-
ple who come here legally. 
There is a waiting list, by the way. 
What do you say to the people who 
are waiting? 
Don’t worry about it. Let all these 
other folks come in and just walk 
through or cross the Rio Grande endan-
gering themselves, endangering Border 
Patrol, not providing resources to the 
Border Patrol to do their job, so they 
are the ones left hanging, dealing with 
COVID, not having resources, being 
alone at midnight with no cell signal, 
no ability to talk on the radio, and no 
ability to move their car up and down 
the Rio Grande River. 
I have got a bill with my friend, 
HENRY
CUELLAR, to have navigable 
roads and a fence along the river. 
Why won’t Speaker PELOSI bring that 
bipartisan bill to the floor of the 
United States House of Representa-
tives? 
It is for one reason and one reason 
only: Democrats want a political tool. 
They want the political reality of a 
wide-open border. There is zero other 
defense for what Democrats are doing, 
instead of actually doing what it takes 
to secure the border of the United 
States. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, when you 
think about it, in 2018 we swore in 
830,000 new U.S. citizens. In 2019 it was 
about 800,000. That is kind of where it 
sits every year. 
I had a young man who worked for 
me; his family were immigrants from 
Mexico. Thirteen years it took for 
them to get citizenship—13 years. And 
if they would have crossed the border 
illegally with the current Democrat 
plan, they would have gotten amnesty. 
Mr. Speaker, think about that. Good 
friends of ours, our neighbors, same sit-
uation, 12, 14 years to get citizenship. 
And do you know what, Mr. Speaker? 
I have to get back to this caravan that 
is coming up. 
Mr. Speaker, what do you think 
95,000 people will do to a town of Del 
Rio’s size, which I think is 30,000, 
36,000, something like that; or Yuma 
which is a town the size of 80,000; or 
how about the town of Douglass; or 
Naco, about 3,000; or Douglass, about 
15,000? 
What happens when they come in 
there? 
We don’t have facilities. They get 
processed and released. That is what 
happens. 
Mr. ROY. That is what happens. They 
get processed and released. And then, 
Mr. Speaker, when you have migrants 
who are coming in between the ports of 
entry and they come across ranches 
and ranchers come across them or they 
die in the desert, then they are left 
having to deal with the body. They are 
left having to go and have a coroner 
come and do the autopsy. They have to 
have, like the gentleman said, body 
trailers coming down there. 
Mr. Speaker, you can’t make this up. 
I just want to know: Do my Democrat 
colleagues think we are making this 
up? 
They may not know because the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security sure as 
heck isn’t coming down and explaining 
this to us. 
I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, we are 
not having a debate here on the floor of 
the House about anything at all much 
less our border. 
Oh, we have time to have political 
show trials. We have time to have a 
subpoena by a sham commission in 
which you wouldn’t even put on the 
ranking member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, Mr. Speaker. You wouldn’t 
even put on my friends, KELLY ARM-
STRONG, JIM BANKS, no, we can’t do 
that. So we are going to have a show 
trial, we are going to come out here, 
and we are going to have political the-
ater. 
But we are not going to do a doggone 
thing about migrants dying and Texans 
dying from fentanyl overdoses. 
Why don’t we talk about the danger 
of fentanyl? 
Oh, no, we don’t want to talk about 
that. Everybody over here has a steak 
dinner they have to go eat tonight. 
Why don’t we talk about the fact 
that there was a high-profile Texas 
Longhorns football player, today they 
put out a statement, the family, 
sadly—Jake Ehlinger, the brother of 
the 
former 
Longhorns 
quarterback 
Sam Ehlinger—in a statement Thurs-
day the Ehlinger family says they 
learned Jake accidentally overdosed 
May 6 from what is believed to be the 
prescription 
antianxiety 
medication 
Xanax laced with fentanyl. 
Well, do you know what, Mr. Speak-
er, and to all my colleagues who are 
not in this Chamber, that is a story 
that is happening every day in America 
across this country: 100,000 people dead, 
dead in this country because of wide- 
open borders, with China putting out 
this synthetic garbage and putting it 
into the system, and our children are 
dying. And the Democratic Party, the 
people leading this Chamber are MIA. 
They don’t care about you, and they 
don’t care about the American people. 
They only care about crass political 
use of the border to advance a racial 
identity agenda. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman is right, 100 percent. Mr. Speak-
er, think about the drug trafficking 
right now. When the cartels want to 
bring in drugs, they flood a zone. Del 
Rio, they put all the Haitians there. 
Mr. Speaker, 224 miles of border went 
unprotected—unprotected—for 8 days. 
They had cameras, but they didn’t 
have any bodies to go arrest these peo-
ple bringing the drugs in. We have got 
places in Arizona for 62 miles with ab-
solutely the only fencing being a vehi-
cle barrier. We have got people coming 
in who are going through mountains. 
We have mountains filled with scouts 
watching and telling these drug car-
riers where they are coming in. They 
come on up, they pop out on Interstate 
8 and the intersection of Interstate 10 
just south of Phoenix. It is the number 
one drug trafficking corridor in the 
country. They spit this stuff out all 
over the country, and now they are 
moving into pills. They are moving 
into pills, counterfeit pills, and we 
have no idea—they are made by some 
dude down in a garage. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, some dude is 
cooking it in Mexico, they are shoving 
this stuff up from Mexico. There is a 
guy cooking the Xanax in the same 
place they have the fentanyl, and peo-
ple are now getting those pills in the 
United States, they are dying, and we 
are just sitting here. 
I have got the same Interstate 10 
going right through San Antonio, the 
same 
Interstate 
10 
going 
through 
Boerne where we just stopped a car 
with nine immigrants in it, two bound 
up in the trunk. The car was being 
driven by a cartel employee, an Amer-
ican citizen, taking them to a stash 
house. That is the story of your cur-
rent open border, Mr. Speaker. And, 
again, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle are completely MIA. 
Mr. BIGGS. Just on that, I have got 
to comment on this because when the

gentleman said he had an American 
citizen, the driver, as an employee of 
the cartel, we see that all up and down 
the border, and they want to get youth 
to do it as well because they are not 
going to be prosecuted. 
Mr. ROY. They are recruiting. 
Mr. BIGGS. They are recruiting 
youth because they are not going to be 
prosecuted as adults. They are going to 
get off easier. 
Mr. ROY. I wonder if the gentleman 
might indulge, I had planned a couple 
of things that were border related, but 
I also have another topic that he might 
be interested in. I want to set the stage 
for something I hope is viewed posi-
tively because I believe right now what 
we are seeing is as Sam Adams put it: 
You don’t need a majority, but you need 
tireless minorities being willing to set 
brushfires of freedom. 
What we are seeing across the coun-
try are people willing to set brushfires 
of freedom. 
A couple of different issues. Right 
now we have a President of the United 
States who has set forth an unconstitu-
tional, unlawful, illegal, and tyrannical 
vaccine mandate that companies have 
to bow down to the altar of this White 
House and do what he says. And I say: 
No, they don’t; and the Governor of 
Texas says: No, you don’t. 
Guess what, Mr. Speaker? Southwest 
Airlines decided to play footsie with 
this tyrannical order, and the pilots 
said, no; the employees of Southwest 
said, no; a lot of their customers said 
no; and people like me and others 
called them to task. 
Guess 
what 
Southwest 
did, 
Mr. 
Speaker? 
They backed off a bit. They have now 
said: We are not going to fire people; 
we will give them unpaid leave. 
I said to Southwest: That is not good 
enough. You need to let them work. 
You need to let them carry out their 
livelihoods. But God bless us, that is a 
move in the right direction. 
Delta Airlines said: Well, we are not 
necessarily going to do that mandate. 
We have got In-N-Out Burger saying: 
Do you know what, Mr. President? We 
are not going to do that. 
God bless these corporate entities 
that are saying: No. No. No. We are not 
going to bow down to whatever the 
President says because he doesn’t have 
the power. He is not a king. You can’t 
say that we are going to get vaccinated 
when we believe there is natural immu-
nity or we believe there might be a 
myocardial issue for our kids, when we 
believe it is in our best interest to de-
cide what we are going to do for our 
families. Under no circumstances are 
we going to bow down to what a dic-
tator in the White House is trying to 
tell us to do, and I wonder if my friend 
from Arizona agrees. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I agree 100 
percent. We have other places where 
the employees are fighting back. You 
have got the Chicago police union. God 
bless them. 
Mr. ROY. Amen. 
Mr. BIGGS. Guess what is happening, 
Mr. Speaker? 
The mayor there is trying to put 
pressure on them. 
Guess what, Mr. Speaker? Indiana 
cities are offering jobs to those Chi-
cago police officers. If they come here, 
we are not going to mandate that. 
Mr. ROY. Yes. We need some cops in 
Austin, Texas, to fill the holes when 
those liberals in Austin decided to get 
rid of the cops. We need some more. 
Come on down. 
Mr. BIGGS. That is what you are see-
ing, Mr. Speaker. I just got a tweet 
just 20 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago. We 
are seeing one of our big companies, 
one of my big defense contractors in 
Arizona had an employee walkout 
today. They don’t want this. 
Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? If 
you want a vaccine, go ahead and get 
the vaccine. 
Mr. ROY. Amen. 
Mr. BIGGS. But doggone it, it should 
not be mandated by a tyrannical gov-
ernment. And this is the tip of the 
spear on a fascist-style government, in 
my opinion. 
Mr. ROY. We have a few others: Gen-
eral Electric employees in Greenville, 
South Carolina, walked out over the 
vaccine mandate. A New York hospital 
will stop delivering babies as workers 
quit over a vaccine mandate. Nearly 
1,900 Washington State employees quit 
or were fired over the vaccine mandate 
because they said no. And a trooper 
tells Governor Inslee to kiss his—fill in 
the blank—in his final signoff before a 
vaccine mandate, and they put their 
boots out on the steps in protest. Se-
attle first responders fired for vaccine 
noncompliance march on city hall to 
turn in their boots. Parents in Cali-
fornia protest student COVID–19 vac-
cine mandate, keep kids home. A vac-
cine opponent protest outside a hos-
pital following shot requirement for 
employees. And a Wyoming teenager— 
God bless that Wyoming teenager—was 
arrested after refusing to wear a mask 
on school grounds. 
That is the America I know. That is 
the America that doesn’t bow down to 
the tyranny of a federal government 
that has no constitutional power to 
tell them what to do and tell them how 
to live their lives. That is the America 
that is going to preserve a republic for 
our kids and grandkids worth passing 
down to them. 
Mr. BIGGS. Amen. People say, look-
ing around, they get so depressed and 
frustrated when they see the horrible 
and horrific impacts of the policies 
coming out of this administration, not 
the least of which is the curtailing of 
their freedoms. 
Mr. ROY. Amen. 
Mr. BIGGS. The gentleman from 
Texas talks and reminds us of all of 
this, and we are seeing it. Like my 
friend, I keep a folder in my computer 
of story after story of people fighting 
back saying: No. We are not going to 
kowtow; we are not going to bow down 
to this tyranny. 
It gives me hope, and it gives us the 
optimism to carry on and keep up the 
fight because this country was born on 
freedom, and it is going to continue. 
We will see a comeback of freedom. 
Like Ronald Reagan said, it may not 
be in your genes, but you have to fight 
it. For every generation it is a new 
fight to keep freedom, and this is our 
fight today. 
Mr. ROY. Amen. We have got front-
line doctors who are out there making 
sure that people can get access to 
ivermectin. We have got people who 
are working around all the barriers of 
these pharmaceutical companies that 
are saying: No, you can’t get this stuff. 
Americans want to take care of their 
loved ones despite a government saying 
they can’t get the treatments that save 
lives. 
I had a woman today break down in 
tears. She came up to me, and I hugged 
her. She was crying because her 52-year 
marriage to her husband—he passed 
away in August. He was fighting 
COVID, and he was beating COVID, but 
he 
couldn’t 
get 
ivermectin. 
They 
couldn’t get to it. They were denied ac-
cess to it, and they couldn’t get 
monoclonal antibody treatment. She 
said to me: If I had been able to get 
him to Florida, I would have saved his 
life, and I would still have my husband. 
Now, I don’t know the facts of that, 
but I hear that from thousands of 
Americans all the time. They are being 
denied the ability to get treatment and 
being denied the ability to get care be-
cause we have got a top-down dictator-
ship coming out of Washington trying 
to coerce and tell the American people 
what their healthcare should look like. 
But it is not just healthcare. It is 
critical race theory. It is all of the gar-
bage being taught in our schools about 
wokeness and telling people that we 
should be racist because that is what 
critical race theory is. It is racism, and 
it is nothing other than that. We have 
got American people, parents, going 
into school boards and saying: Enough. 
We are not having it anymore. 
We have got Texas Carroll Inde-
pendent School District; parents in 
Southlake recently fought back and 
won; Fort Worth Independent School 
District; Colleyville, Texas; New York, 
Clarkstown School Board; Georgia, At-
lanta where parents are coming in, and 
they are saying enough. We believe in 
America, and we believe in the content 
of one’s character and not the color of 
their skin. We don’t want to listen to 
this garbage dividing us further by 
race. 
Mr. BIGGS. One of the only good 
things about the COVID outbreak was 
that parents got to see what the kids 
were learning for a change, and when 
they saw it, they said: This is not what 
I want my kid to learn. And they start-
ed standing up. 
Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? It is 
working. 
But do you know what is happening? 
Right now, we have got an Attorney 
General who has basically said: We are

going to stop those protests, we are 
going to stop that communication that 
is First Amendment messaging that 
you give as parents to the school 
boards. 
That is not the American way. That 
is the tyranny, and that is the fascism 
we are fighting about. That is what you 
and I were fighting with the Attorney 
General today about. And doggone it, 
we have got to stand up, and those par-
ents need to be able to stand up, ex-
press themselves, and express their 
protest. 
Mr. ROY. I always notice that my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
snicker when we say things about crit-
ical race theory. They laugh at it. But 
they never want to debate the actual 
substance of the garbage being taught. 
They never want to actually look at 
the curriculum, look at the books, and 
look at what is being taught. 
The Virginia Department of Edu-
cation 
administered 
a 
training 
to 
teachers that included a presentation 
instructing them to embrace critical 
race theory and engage in race con-
scious teaching and learning in order 
to—this is a quote—reengineer atti-
tudes and belief systems. 
b 1830 
That is what it is about. Its roots are 
in Marxist ideology, and we know it. It 
is clear. It is evident, and we see it in 
Loudoun County right now where we 
see what is unfolding in Loudoun Coun-
ty, which is all about critical race the-
ory, parents getting angry, and then a 
school board stepping right over the 
rights of a dad to be able to go down 
and protest to the school board because 
his daughter was raped in a bathroom 
by a dude wearing a skirt. And they 
want to then go down and say, oh, well, 
we are just going to say this is domes-
tic terrorism. 
And what happens? The Attorney 
General of the United States gives the 
FBI the power to go after parents be-
cause parents are protesting against 
this stuff because they know the power 
is in the people. We the people. 
And you know what? The American 
people are on to this stuff, and the 
American people are going to stop it 
because that is the way we do things in 
this country. 
Mr. BIGGS. That is where it is. That 
is where the fire is starting, right there 
at the level of the people. 
And if we are going to save this coun-
try—I tell people all the time—it is 
going to come from the grassroots. It is 
going to come from the people. It is 
going to take off into the local juris-
dictions in the States. 
If you think that you are going to 
save this Nation with the United 
States Congress, you are sadly mis-
taken. It is the States. It is the indi-
viduals. It is the families. It is the peo-
ple who love this country, and they are 
going to keep fighting us back. I am 
with you 100 percent on that. 
Mr. ROY. Well, I thank the gen-
tleman from Arizona for his comments. 
I believe my time is winding down. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 1 minute re-
maining. 
Mr. ROY. Well, I appreciate the 
Speaker for his indulgence. I appre-
ciate my friend from Arizona. 
I would just point out that what we 
learned today was highly troubling. 
What we saw with the Attorney Gen-
eral, what we learned today when we 
saw 
that 
the 
White 
House 
was 
colluding—we saw this in evidence in 
emails—colluding with the National 
Association of School Boards to in-
clude language in the memoranda that 
then got the Attorney General to go 
target parents with the FBI. We saw 
that. It was evidence. The AG admitted 
today in our committee, he said, be-
cause of that memo, I created this ef-
fort by the FBI. We saw that. It is hap-
pening. The American people are onto 
it. 
The American people, if you are lis-
tening to me, you stand strong. You 
say no. Say no to vaccine mandates, 
say no to mask mandates, say no to all 
the nonsense coming out of this crit-
ical race theory garbage. Stand up for 
your kids. Go to school boards, turn 
over the school boards, and fight for 
freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
HOUSING IS CENTER OF ECONOMIC 
STABILITY AND PROSPERITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on my Special Order, and to in-
sert extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, last 
month, the House Financial Services 
Committee 
Democrats 
unanimously 
passed the housing title of the Build 
Back Better Act to provide $327 billion 
in 
critical 
investments 
needed 
to 
affordably house America and invest in 
neighborhoods across the country. 
With the inclusion of my commit-
tee’s housing title, the Build Back Bet-
ter Act will create over 3 million af-
fordable and accessible homes. It will 
fully address the needed repairs in pub-
lic housing so residents can safely live 
in their homes with dignity. 
It will help an estimated 750,000 
households afford their rent or exit 
homelessness through expanded hous-
ing choice vouchers. It will address the 
racial wealth gap by helping first-gen-
eration home buyers access homeown-
ership. These investments will help the 
schoolteacher experiencing homeless-
ness; the children exposed to lead and 
other harmful toxins in their homes; 
the elderly neighbor who can’t afford 
their prescription medications on a 
fixed income because the rent and 
mortgage is too high; the millennial 
who cannot rely on the bank of mom 
and dad for a downpayment to pur-
chase their first home; and the millions 
of families that hang in the balance of 
imminent eviction or foreclosure due 
to the pandemic. 
Just today, my committee heard 
from several witnesses on the impor-
tance of the housing choice voucher 
program and how transformational it 
can be for a family to receive this as-
sistance. Harvard Professor Raj Chetty 
testified about his research showing 
that children whose families received a 
housing choice voucher to move to low- 
poverty neighborhoods later in life 
earned 30 percent more than children 
who remained in high-poverty neigh-
borhoods. Another witness testified 
about how the voucher program helps 
his clients escape homelessness and 
achieve housing stability. 
Housing is at the center of every 
household’s economic stability and our 
Nation’s prosperity. Without these in-
vestments in resilient, healthy, acces-
sible, and fair housing, the Build Back 
Better Act will not improve the lives of 
families across the country, as we have 
promised it will. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to try, in 
the best way that I possibly can, to de-
scribe what is happening in the Con-
gress of the United States of America. 
This build back mission, this act, is the 
vision of the President of the United 
States of America. President Biden has 
taken the leadership for job creation. 
He has taken the leadership to deal 
with some of the equity issues in this 
country. He has taken the leadership 
to do everything that can be done to 
ensure that we invest in the human po-
tential of the citizens of this country. 
He is doing everything that he can to 
deal with the pandemic, and he is un-
earthing and revealing the softness in 
our economy, in our society, prior to 
that pandemic, and this is difficult 
work. This is not easy. 
Of course, eventually, we had to deal 
with the fact that we have some who 
were resisting the mission of the Presi-
dent to build back better. 
At one point in time, I know there 
was some talk about a $600 trillion bill. 
And, of course, we have heard most 
about a $327 trillion bill. So at this 
point in time, we don’t have the co-
operation in order to realize the Presi-
dent’s mission and vision about what it 
takes in order to support the citizens 
of this country in a way that will help 
to change their lives. 
However, this is transformative. This 
is the kind of legislation that the 
President of the United States has de-
veloped and worked with because he

understands what it takes to strength-
en the economy, to create jobs, to open 
up opportunities, to deal with rental 
assistance, and all of these issues. 
Unfortunately, there are two mem-
bers of the Democratic Party on the 
Senate side who do not agree. It has 
taken us a long time to understand 
what it is they want, what it is they 
don’t want. But in the final analysis, 
they do not, at this point in time, sup-
port the President’s vision. 
However, those of us who chair com-
mittees worked very hard on our por-
tion of the Build Back Better Act. I, as 
the chair of the Financial Services 
Committee, worked very hard with our 
staff in order to identify what is abso-
lutely needed in order to support hous-
ing in a real way in this country. Hous-
ing issues that have been disregarded, 
that have not been paid attention to, 
housing issues that have gone unat-
tended to for so many years, in that, of 
course, we dealt with public housing 
and the fact that they were in great 
disrepair, and they needed the re-
sources necessary to fix those ele-
vators; in order to get the lead out of 
the paint; in order to make sure that 
the stairways are safe. 
I am reminded of the fact that Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ from New York called me 
from one of the public housing develop-
ments last winter when there was no 
heat in the entire development. 
So this money is desperately needed 
for the capital investments that we 
need to do in public housing. But not 
only do we deal with public housing, we 
deal with the fact that there are people 
who work every day but cannot afford 
the rents. We deal with people who are 
paying 50 percent of their income for 
rent. We deal with people who are on 
the ground in makeshift tents every 
day, homeless all over America. 
One of the issues that has become 
very important to me is the choice 
voucher issue. So in addition to the $80 
billion that we advocated for public 
housing, there is another $90 billion 
that we advocated for the vouchers. 
This includes not only choice vouchers. 
It includes project-based vouchers so 
that we can develop more affordable 
units. 
Of course, we recognized what the 
cities wanted, what they have been 
dealing with, and what they believe 
will improve their ability to assist 
those who are trying to get safely 
housed. That is the HOME program 
that the cities love. That is the CDBG 
program and those programs we fund-
ed. In addition to that, I want you to 
know that Barney Frank and I worked 
for years in order to come up with the 
National Housing Trust Fund. So we 
had $36 billion that we put into that. 
Now, given that we don’t know what 
the top line is in the Build Back Better 
Act, and we don’t know exactly wheth-
er or not our Senators on the opposite 
side—on the Democratic side or the op-
posite side—will honor this vision and 
this leadership of the President. So 
without knowing what the top line is, 
we know that probably we are all going 
to have to take cuts in all the areas 
that we have worked so hard for. 
I am certainly prepared to accept our 
share of that responsibility. I know 
that cuts have to be made, but they 
have to be made fairly. And so there 
was a rumor that there was going to be 
zero dollars advocated to these choice 
vouchers and project-based vouchers, 
and, of course, that made me very un-
happy. That caused me to have great 
concern. I have been working, orga-
nizing press conferences, working with 
the advocates, working with academi-
cians and everybody to help the admin-
istration and everybody else under-
stand that we cannot do without ade-
quate vouchers for the people who are 
in such desperate need of rental assist-
ance. 
Everywhere 
all 
over 
the 
United 
States, 
particularly 
in 
Black 
and 
Brown communities, people have been 
waiting for years to be able to get 
these vouchers. And so we have a time 
now by which we are going to be fund-
ing some of what is needed in housing, 
and at the top of my list are the vouch-
ers. 
I want everybody to know that I have 
been talking with members of our Cau-
cus and I have been talking with mem-
bers of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus. We are not backing away from get-
ting a substantial number of vouchers 
funded. I am not going to back away. I 
am not going to be shy about it. 
As a matter of fact, I will let the 
world know that I and others that I 
have organized will not vote for any 
bill that does not have a substantial 
number of vouchers in it so that we can 
deal with the longstanding issues of a 
lack of decent and safe and secure 
housing in our communities. 
I don’t need to say any more. All I 
need to let people know is, I am fair. I 
accept cuts across many of these areas 
that I have worked so hard for, but I do 
not want my number one issue in all of 
this housing to be undermined, ne-
glected. And I do not want the people 
of our districts who expect their gov-
ernment to come to their aid when 
they are coming to the aid of others in 
so many ways—and I respect the fact 
that in our Caucus and in the Progres-
sive Caucus, we have about five dif-
ferent kinds of interests that we want 
to see supported. I, tonight, am talking 
about housing. But I respect the agen-
da of the Progressive Caucus and the 
five areas that they have identified. 
But for me, housing is number one. 
I will now call on those who are par-
ticipating this evening. 
I yield to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. CLEAVER), who is also my 
friend and chair of the Financial Serv-
ices Committee’s Subcommittee on 
Housing, Community Development and 
Insurance. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Madam Chair for yielding. Let me 
begin my comments by thanking the 
gentlewoman, as I have done in front of 
you and away from you, because I 
think you have placed housing on the 
front burner in this country right now, 
and it could not have come sooner. 
Let me just say that—because I was 
disoriented 
because 
of 
the 
earlier 
speakers and then got a really bad 
headache, but I am going to still be 
able to share these comments—I prob-
ably did not grow up like many of the 
people 
in 
a 
contemporary 
United 
States. I grew up in Texas just outside 
of downtown Dallas, and I had no idea 
that we were poor. 
b 1845 
Never mind the fact that we had an 
outhouse about 30 or 40 yards down a 
hill by a little creek. Never mind the 
fact that we didn’t have windows in our 
house. Actually, we did have windows, 
but my father or somebody had put tin 
over the windows to keep the winter 
cold out. The good blessing there was, 
in Texas, the weather is quite mild in 
the winter. 
But I lived in a shack, and there were 
six people in it. There were two rooms. 
My three sisters slept on one side of 
the room, and I slept on the other side 
of the room. The kitchen was not real-
ly a kitchen. We had what was called 
an icebox, and the iceman would bring 
a big block of ice every 2 or 3 days for 
50 cents. 
So I guess somebody could say, well, 
his parents weren’t working and that is 
what happens in this country when 
people don’t work. It may be inter-
esting, at least for some, to know that 
my father attended Prairie View, did 
not graduate from Prairie View, came 
back home and started his own busi-
ness, Cleaver’s Cleaners. And in a town 
where there was rigid segregation, he 
could only do the people in the neigh-
borhood, 
and 
that 
didn’t 
provide 
enough income. 
But he kept us in this house as com-
fortably as possible. In fact, one night, 
I asked my mother if I could share 
something that is called hoe cakes, big 
biscuits. She would make syrup, and I 
loved it. It was like heaven. I asked her 
if I could share those with the people 
who lived on the big street. We lived in 
an ally, and there were big mansions 
that are still there today, and I wanted 
to take some over and give it to the 
rich kids, because my mother said they 
didn’t have any hoe cakes. 
But we lived in a house. And my fa-
ther, who turned 100 on July 16, paid 
$20 a month on a shack, probably was 
worth maybe $250. So I grew up in that 
house. 
We then moved to public housing. My 
father worked—and, in fact, I don’t 
know how he made it, and I don’t know 
how he lived to be 100, because my fa-
ther worked three jobs. He worked at 
the First Baptist Church, a huge 
church, still is a huge church that is 
known all over the country. And then, 
on Saturday mornings, he cleaned up 
the T. A. Litteken’s Construction Com-
pany office building. Then on Satur-
days, he would serve parties. He did 
that for years and years and years and 
years.

I hope he is watching this tonight, 
because I want to say thank you to 
him, because I don’t know how he did 
all of that. Because my mother did not 
go to school, college, he felt like it was 
his responsibility to send her to col-
lege. 
So we moved to public housing. And 
as I have said publicly, my father lied 
to the officials at the public housing, 
the Rosewood projects. He would not 
tell them that he had another job, be-
cause to do so meant that he would 
have to increase his rent. 
So he saved every dime he could get, 
every dime, and bought a house in the 
White neighborhood and had it moved 
on a Saturday night to the east side of 
town where African Americans lived. 
This was his dream. My father had 
the house fixed up. We moved into the 
house. I had my own bedroom. I 
thought we were rich. I mean, we actu-
ally had an indoor bathroom. I remem-
ber, I spent one night just flushing the 
toilet, just playing with it. It was like 
heaven. Then my mother started col-
lege when I was in the seventh grade. 
My father insisted. 
My father was willing to do whatever 
he had to do to build his family. But 
the key to all of it was housing. That 
separated us from a lot of others. Hous-
ing, it is the most significant thing a 
human being can have. It makes them 
a part of the American Dream. 
My daddy is somebody—and this rose 
so high—that his lawn was put on dis-
play in the local newspaper. The lawn 
of the summer, that is what he wanted 
to do. 
Madam Chair, I appreciate every-
thing you have done and said to bring 
us to this point. 
I want to say to anybody watching, if 
you live in the United States, the most 
powerful, the richest Nation on this 
planet, you have no business sleeping 
outside with 700,000 people who do it 
every single night in this country. You 
have no business being unable to afford 
a house in the United States, because 
the 
average 
price 
now 
is 
almost 
$400,000. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TORRES), my friend. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I would not be here today as 
a United States Congressman were it 
not for affordable housing and the op-
portunity it gave me and my family. 
So the fight is deeply personal, and I 
am honored to stand in the trenches 
with Chair WATERS and Chair CLEAVER 
as we fight for affordable housing at a 
critical moment. 
We cannot build back better without 
realizing the vision of housing as a 
human right and without realizing the 
vision of housing as infrastructure. We 
cannot build back better without mak-
ing America affordable to all Ameri-
cans. Housing is not an afterthought; 
housing is foundational, not only to 
who we are but to who we become. 
We know from the research of Pro-
fessor Raj Chetty that ZIP Code is 
often destiny and that where you live 
determines your access to opportunity. 
It often determines the quality of the 
schools you attend and the services 
you access. 
We know that housing is not only 
foundational but also intersectional. It 
intersects with climate. In New York 
City, we saw not one, but two record 
rainfalls. And as our city has become 
less and less affordable. More and more 
Americans are living in illegal base-
ment apartments that were heavily 
flooded by the remnants of Hurricane 
Ida, and those Americans died at the 
intersection of the housing crisis and 
the climate crisis. 
Housing 
intersects 
with 
public 
health. As our city has become less and 
less affordable, more and more New 
Yorkers and Americans are living in 
overcrowded apartments. And we saw 
those overcrowded homes become Petri 
dishes for the spread of COVID–19. 
Housing is essential. Housing sta-
bilizes the essential workforce that 
stabilizes the rest of us. According to 
the National Low Income Housing Coa-
lition, there is not a single county in 
America where an essential worker 
earning minimum wage could afford a 
two-bedroom apartment, and there are 
only 7 out of 3,000 counties where an es-
sential worker earning minimum wage 
could afford a one-bedroom apartment. 
If you are an essential worker earning 
the Federal minimum wage of $7.25 an 
hour, you would have to work 72 hours 
a week in order to afford a one-bed-
room apartment. 
The central cause of my life has been 
public housing. My mother taught me 
that the most important lesson in life 
is to never forget where you come 
from. I come from the Bronx, and I 
come from public housing. 
In New York City, we have the New 
York City Housing Authority, com-
monly known as NYCHA, which is the 
largest provider of affordable housing 
in the continent of North America, 
housing a population of about half a 
million Americans. Half a million is 
larger than most large cities in the 
United States. If NYCHA were a city 
unto itself, it would be the largest city 
of low-income Black and Brown Ameri-
cans in the country. 
I feel, Mr. Speaker, that we are on 
the verge of making history. We are on 
the verge of going from FDR’s New 
Deal to LBJ’s Great Society to Joe 
Biden’s Build Back Better. But the fun-
damental difference between FDR’s 
New Deal and Joe Biden’s Build Back 
Better is racial equity. FDR’s New 
Deal was racially exclusionary, and the 
Build Back Better Act must be racially 
equitable. 
We cannot build back better without 
advancing the cause of racial equity, 
but we cannot advance the cause of ra-
cial equity without rebuilding NYCHA, 
without rebuilding America’s largest 
city of low-income Black and Brown 
Americans. We must rebuild affordable 
housing. 
Infrastructure is about more than 
roads and bridges. It is about safe, de-
cent, affordable housing. Safe, decent, 
affordable housing represents roads and 
bridges to the American Dream, and I 
stand here as living proof. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN), 
who is also the Chair of the Financial 
Services Committee’s Subcommittee 
on Oversight and Investigations. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it 
is always a preeminent privilege to be 
in 
the 
company 
of 
Chairwoman 
WATERS, especially when she has taken 
up a cause that is not only worthy but 
noble. I greatly appreciate what she is 
doing tonight. 
I would say this, housing is infra-
structure, and housing is infrastruc-
ture for a multiplicity of reasons. 
I neglected to say ‘‘and still I rise.’’ 
And still I rise to talk about housing 
is infrastructure. Housing is infrastruc-
ture. 
If we traverse the highways and by-
ways across our country, in our urban 
areas, we will find persons who are 
sleeping 
under 
overpasses, 
sleeping 
under bridges, sleeping along the roads, 
the roadways. 
Overpasses and bridges have become 
housing. The infrastructure itself now 
has become housing. It is my belief 
that if an overpass can become hous-
ing, which is infrastructure, then the 
housing itself can be infrastructure. It 
is time for us to fully fund these hous-
ing programs. 
I would mention but one that I think 
is very important to us, and that is the 
housing choice voucher program. This 
is an important program, because I had 
my staff to compile some statistical in-
formation for me, and here is what 
they have called to my attention. We 
need to know who actually benefits. 
Over 40 percent of these voucher recipi-
ents are households with children, 29 
percent are the elderly, and 36 percent 
are nonelderly people with disabilities. 
This myth that people are, for some 
reason, deciding that they will just 
make their way through life on the 
backs of others, is something that I 
call inanity. It is close to insanity to 
say this when you examine the empir-
ical evidence. 
We also find that, yes, the wait time 
is long, averaging 2.5 years nationally. 
Many of the lines are closed, with the 
50 largest housing authorities having 
wait times of a year or more and some 
up to 8 years. 
Madam Speaker and Madam Chair, 
there is much more to be said, but the 
time is limited. I would simply say 
this, vouchers have shown to reduce 
homelessness, help people pay rent, re-
duce poverty, help children exit the 
welfare system, help persons find and 
keep employment, help children do bet-
ter in school, help people with disabil-
ities maintain their health, help people 
achieve greater economic mobility, 
help people build wealth, and help fam-
ilies enter the middle class. It is time 
to fully fund the voucher system.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5787 
October 21, 2021 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the 
American people to express my support 
for the maintenance of effort of the ro-
bust housing provisions of the Build 
Back Better Act that is before us as a 
body. 
I would like to thank the chair-
woman of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, a champion for all of us in the 
United States of America, but particu-
larly for the poor and disenfranchised. 
I rise on behalf of all our American 
families who are directly impacted by 
our affordable housing crisis, and I rise 
today, Mr. Speaker, because despite 
the 
proposed 
solutions 
Democrats 
fought to secure in the bill to address 
our housing crisis head-on, they are at 
risk of being eliminated, negotiated 
away from the revised package. 
The housing crisis in America is real 
and growing exponentially each and 
every month. Housing insecurity is 
very real in the lives of far too many 
American families. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of 
my constituents in central and south 
Brooklyn who continue to struggle due 
to the lack of affordable housing and 
for whom overdevelopment of market- 
rate units has created a gentrification 
juggernaut that has swollen the ranks 
of the homeless in New York City and 
across this Nation, working families 
stuck who can’t afford to stay in their 
apartments but can’t afford to leave 
their towns. 
The effects of gentrification and 
COVID–19 have truly compounded this 
crisis, causing many to be evicted from 
their homes and experiencing home-
lessness at a rate we have never seen, 
all due to the lack of real and sus-
tained investment in affordable hous-
ing. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I believe 
our time has been exhausted. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT WILL 
PERMANENTLY CHANGE AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to spend some time address-
ing the Chair and America on the 
American Rescue Plan or, actually, on 
the Build Back Better Act, which is 
kind of a follow-up on the American 
Rescue Plan. 
We know the result of that original 
big-spending, government-printing act 
was a big increase in inflation in the 
United States, apparent to one and all. 
This is a follow-up bill to that, which 
will further require the Federal Re-
serve to print more money, driving up 
the cost of gas, of food, of housing ev-
erywhere we look. 
But I am not going to address just 
the cost of this bill tonight. I am going 
to address the way I believe it will per-
manently change America and the vi-
sion the Democratic Party apparently 
has for America in the future. 
In this bill, we are adding 87,000 IRS 
agents. For quite a while, when I would 
give talks about this bill, I would talk 
about 8,700 because when my staff told 
me it was 87,000, I felt I had to correct 
them. Nobody would want to add 87,000 
IRS agents. But I stand corrected. I 
was wrong. 
In this bill, we are adding 87,000 IRS 
agents, enough to fill up a massive 
American football stadium. Being from 
Wisconsin, I think of Camp Randall 
Stadium, where the University of Wis-
consin plays. I think of Lambeau Field, 
where the Packers play. Somebody 
wants to hire that many IRS agents. 
It is not in the bill, but it is in con-
junction with a proposal I think the 
Biden administration has, to monitor 
every $600 transfer of funds. What type 
of country would have this many IRS 
agents and want to know if you spend 
$600 on who knows what—giving to the 
politically incorrect church; giving to 
a politically incorrect nonprofit; giving 
money to a fringe, eccentric sibling; 
whatever. 
It sounds like something more you 
would think of in East Germany when 
East Germany was around rather than 
the United States. But that is appar-
ently the vision of the party that put 
together the Build Back Better Act. 
As was just mentioned in this bill, we 
are adding money for more low-income 
apartments. Now, that sounds good. 
President Biden also recently increased 
the food stamp allowance. 
There is an author of mine that I sug-
gest Americans read by the name of 
Theodore Dalrymple, an English au-
thor who was a doctor dealing both 
with 
English 
prisons 
and 
English 
slums. 
He talked about the empty lives that 
people who live what I will refer to as 
the welfare lifestyle that England had. 
He attributed that empty life to the 
fact that in England—and maybe they 
backed off this by now, but at least 
England 15 years ago, no matter how 
irresponsible you were, you always got 
a free apartment; you always got free 
food; and you always got free medical 
care. In other words, there was no re-
sponsibility when you got up in the 
morning to really accomplish anything 
because you would always be able to 
exist. 
We are close to that right now, but I 
am afraid the majority party wants to 
go all the way there when I look at this 
proposal. I hope the majority party 
stops and thinks in addition to the 
cost, 
more 
importantly, 
psycho-
logically what will it do to the people 
of America if, when you graduate from 
high school or don’t graduate from 
high school, if you want to, particu-
larly if you have a child, you can live 
a lifestyle in which you can be com-
pletely irresponsible. You will always 
be able to eat and always be able to 
have a nice air-conditioned, heated 
apartment, which will probably have 
more square feet per person than the 
average housing in Europe, much less 
around the world. 
This will, again, change America for 
the worse. Psychologically, it will give 
people nothing to live for. By the way, 
since it is usually targeted at people 
with children, it also will create a sad 
situation we have already created in 
this country in which men will have 
less responsibility for taking care of 
their children. 
When you have no other responsibil-
ities in life, it can lead to, first, an 
empty, depressed life; and, secondly, it 
can lead to—what?—idle hands are the 
Devil’s workshop. 
There are other things in this bill 
that will also change America. We are 
aiming for universal 3- or 4-year-old 
kindergarten, I guess you would call it. 
As a sidelight, this bill says that the 
people in these daycares, which is kind 
of what they are, need a college degree. 
That is a little bit of snobbery that we 
should put an end to, the idea that if I 
have a college degree, I am always bet-
ter off than somebody who doesn’t have 
a college degree. 
If you are applying for a job, we treat 
the hardworking, intelligent, common-
sense person without a college degree 
as being, for some reason, less worthy 
of a higher paycheck than the lack of 
commonsense person who may not 
have a strong work ethic who does get 
a college degree. That is just a 
sidelight. A bad provision there. 
But another provision about this that 
is bad is you are taking the care of the 
3- and 4-year-olds out of the parents 
and giving it exclusively to the govern-
ment. Now, a given number of parents 
may prefer it, but I think throughout 
most of this country, the raising of the 
children has been primarily the respon-
sibility of the family. 
I know the Marxist element in the 
other party does not want parents and, 
in particular, fathers too involved in 
their children’s upbringing. But I feel 
this will again permanently change 
America. 
I should point out, if you look at the 
studies, American schools sometimes 
have bad test scores. But our test 
scores are pretty good in the fourth 
grade. In other words, our problem in 
this country isn’t that the children are 
doing poorly when the parents take 
care of them. Those test scores for chil-
dren in American schools are falling in 
middle school and high school. So the 
problem is later on. It is not with the 
3- and 4-year-olds when the parents 
have responsibility. 
I should also point out that we are, in 
this bill, increasing Pell grants. Now, 
there are two problems there. Pell 
grants are grants going toward what 
we will refer to as low-income people, 
but they don’t go to middle-class peo-
ple. 
I am already getting complaints in 
my district from Pell grants in the 
past as couples, married couples who 
thought they were being responsible in 
raising their children, they find out 
their children might be going $30,000 or

$40,000 in debt to get a college degree. 
But if the parents hadn’t been working 
or hadn’t been working as hard, those 
parents’ children are eligible for free 
college. 
I know I am sure it always feels good 
to give more away, but put yourself in 
the place of the middle-class American 
family that is working to raise their 
child, a married couple, and you see 
somebody else next door not working 
very hard, and as a bonus, their chil-
dren get free college, where the respon-
sible middle-class kid winds up $30,000 
or $40,000 in debt. Another example 
here of complete unfairness and per-
verse incentives. 
When I go back home, one of the 
major concerns of businesses is they 
can’t find anybody to work. Now, I 
would hope everybody sometimes tours 
their businesses and is familiar with 
that. Obviously, hiring 87,000 new IRS 
agents is going to take 87,000 people 
away from the private sector. 
But another interesting proposal in 
this bill is we have a new expanded ci-
vilian conservation corps. In other 
words, we are taking more people away 
from the factories, the construction 
sites, the retail outlets that they so 
desperately need to hire them for the 
government, make them dependent on 
the government, but above all make 
sure they are not available for the pri-
vate sector. Another big mistake. 
I mentioned the Pell grants and the 
fact that in a way they are a little bit 
of an insult to the middle-class kids 
who have to go further and further in 
debt. But another interesting provision 
about these Pell grants and another 
way that they clearly want to change 
America in this bill is you are eligible 
for the Pell grants if you are here ille-
gally. This is not a mistake. I am not 
making this up. 
I am on both the Education and 
Labor Committee and the Budget Com-
mittee, where we tried to take this pro-
vision out, and the Democrats on those 
committees proudly defended the pro-
vision. They really believe that if you 
come here, you are entitled to free col-
lege, whereas if you are a member of a 
middle-class American working family, 
your children should go $30,000 to 
$50,000 in debt to get a college degree. 
I mean, it is almost beyond belief, but 
that is another one of the features of 
this bill and one of the reasons why I 
really hope it fails. 
Another feature of this bill, be it nat-
ural gas or methane, is increasing 
taxes, driving up the cost of energy in 
the United States. The environmental-
ists in this country may be interested 
to know that already the high cost of 
energy in the United States, and even 
more Europe, is causing more and more 
foundries, and I assume other factories 
as well, to go up in India, which is a 
much, much, much bigger pollution 
problem than the United States. 
So when you drive up the cost of en-
ergy, which is so very important for 
American factories in general and our 
foundries in particular, what this bill 
would do is ship more American manu-
facturing jobs abroad and increase the 
overall pollution in the United States 
as we have energy production go from 
the new, clean power plants in America 
to the much dirtier power plants in 
India, China, and from around the 
world. 
Other things in this bill that are a 
little bit irritating: After much effort, 
the Republicans, when they were in 
charge, required Social Security num-
bers for the child tax credits. Why did 
we require Social Security numbers? 
To make sure people are not filling out 
tax returns and getting tax refunds 
they aren’t entitled to. I don’t know 
why anybody would not want Social 
Security numbers so we can check to 
see if somebody says they have five 
children, they really have five children 
and get the money back. 
For whatever motivation—I can’t 
even imagine what the motivation 
would be—in this bill the wonderful 
Democratic Party is saying, no, you 
don’t need Social Security numbers to 
get refunds for your child tax credit, 
which will not just increase a form of 
welfare. This will increase a form of 
welfare cheating. Why you would do 
this, again I can’t imagine. 
b 1915 
One other provision in this bill, not a 
fiscal provision, the Democrat Party is 
trying to allow, I would say, 8 to 11 
million people currently here illegally 
to become legal. 
First of all, you are rewarding people 
who broke the law to come into this 
country. And secondly, when you make 
8 to 11 million people legal who were 
previously illegal it is like putting a 
sign on the United States, which the 
drug cartels who are involved in all 
this illegal immigration, will show 
around the world: Come to the United 
States. We are not enforcing our immi-
gration laws. 
Perhaps the majority party is not 
aware that already the drug gangs in 
both Central America and Brazil are 
taking out TV ads inviting people to 
come into the United States. 
Why do they do that? Because if 
you’re in Central America, they may 
charge you 5 to $7,000 to come here. In 
Brazil they may charge you $10,000 to 
come here. And because there is money 
to be made for the drug gangs, they ad-
vertise, encouraging people to come 
here. 
Now, when we do something like, in 
essence, legalize people who are al-
ready here illegally, don’t you think 
the drug gangs are going to educate the 
people in Central America as to what 
we are doing? Of course they are. 
So not only are you inviting people 
or creating people who are illegal or 
who were previously illegal, but, worse, 
you are giving a green light to anybody 
hanging out in other countries, now is 
the time to come to America. 
By the way, when I am down on the 
border, another thing I hear is the co-
operation from the Mexican Govern-
ment has been less and less over the 6 
or 8 months as we try to control our 
border, not only to keep illegal people 
out but to keep the drugs out, as well. 
Our Border Patrol notices a little 
less cooperation from the Mexicans, 
and I can see why. They believe they 
are getting less cooperation because if 
the United States itself doesn’t care 
about its own border, why should Mexi-
can law enforcement risk their lives 
protecting the border and protecting 
the integrity of the border if the 
United States itself doesn’t care? 
So here we have another provision 
which advertises the United States 
doesn’t care about their immigration 
laws. I am sure the Mexican Border Pa-
trol, the Mexican military is aware of 
it, and what will they think of it? Why 
should I risk my butt preventing peo-
ple from coming here if the United 
States itself doesn’t care? 
So, again, I encourage America to 
wake up. We are permanently changing 
the type of country that this is if this 
bill passes as is. 
So I encourage Americans to contact 
their legislators. Please don’t pass this 
bill. 
Now, I will make two more brief com-
ments for the press corps, if they are 
even paying attention to this. 
Like all Congressmen, I frequently 
get contacted on issues and asked 
whether I can look into it. Of course, 
agencies don’t like to respond to re-
quests from individual Congressmen, 
particularly Congressmen in the mi-
nority, but I think the press corps, 
which is so incredibly powerful, more 
powerful than they imagine, can get 
answers from bureaucratic agencies the 
way perhaps Congressmen cannot. And 
I am going to mention two requests 
here. 
I had requests from people of both 
parties, both Republicans and Demo-
crats, as to what is in the videos when 
we had the attacks on this building on 
January 6. For whatever reason, those 
videos have not been made public. Peo-
ple would like to know what was going 
on. I would hope the press corps would 
apply a little bit of pressure to the ap-
propriate authorities and make those 
videos public. Because from what I can 
tell, in my district both the on-the-ball 
Republicans and the on-the-ball Demo-
crats wish we could see those videos. 
And I think if the press applied a little 
bit of pressure, we would see those vid-
eos. 
The other thing I am hearing from 
my constituents back home is they 
wonder about the apparent use of 
ivermectin in India. If you look at the 
popular Worldometer website, they will 
show a dramatic drop in fatalities in 
India over the last few months, just a 
shocking drop. 
People claim it is from ivermectin. I 
don’t know if it is true or not. But the 
American news media ought to wake 
up and cover the story and find out if 
it is.

If it is not from ivermectin, the 
American public should know it be-
cause then they have been sold a bill of 
goods. 
If it is from ivermectin, the Amer-
ican public should know that because 
maybe we have a way to greatly reduce 
the number of fatalities. 
So those are two requests that I have 
of our sometimes slumbering press 
corps. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Shepherd of love, You have been our 
help in ages past. You are our hope for 
the years to come. As we begin today’s 
legislative session, we pause to ac-
knowledge 
Your 
sovereignty. 
Lord, 
You sit enthroned between the cher-
ubim, so shower us with gifts from 
Your bounty. 
Today, lead our lawmakers beside 
still waters and replenish their spirits 
with Your power. As they grapple with 
the challenges we face, give them a 
faith that will not shrink. Lord, pro-
vide our Senators with wisdom to hear 
Your voice and courage to obey Your 
counsel. Help them to seek Your wis-
dom by daily exposing themselves to 
the guidance of sacred Scripture. 
Remind us all that success comes not 
by might or power but by Your Spirit. 
We pray in Your holy Name. Amen. 
f

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
voting rights, yesterday, this Chamber 
had an opportunity to begin debate on 
protecting the voting rights of Amer-
ican citizens. That right, essential to 
any democracy, is under attack in 
ways we have not seen in generations. 
Despite the obvious danger, Senate 
Republicans crushed any opportunity 
this Chamber had to even begin a de-
bate on the Freedom to Vote Act. We 
didn’t ask Republicans to sign their 
names to any policy. We simply asked 
them to come to the table so the Sen-
ate can work as intended, and they re-
fused. 
Let there be no mistake, Senate Re-
publicans blocking debate yesterday 
was their implicit endorsement of the 
horrid new voter suppression and elec-
tion subversion laws passed in conserv-
ative States across the country. When 
they wouldn’t debate, they said these 
horrid new laws that suppress voters, 
that subvert our elections are OK. 
It is ludicrous—ludicrous—for Repub-
licans to pretend that the Federal Gov-
ernment has no role to play in defense 
of our liberties. Of course, it does. They 
should read the Constitution. 
But despite Republican opposition, 
the fight to protect our democracy is 
far from over in the U.S. Senate. Vot-
ing rights are too precious, too funda-
mental to abandon because of obstruc-
tion from the minority. 
As soon as next week, I am prepared 
to bring another proposal to the floor, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. 
The Voting Rights Act has histori-
cally been bipartisan, but following the 
gutting of the law by recent Supreme 
Court rulings, the Voting Rights Act 
needs to be restored, and the Senate 
ought to, at a minimum, be permitted 
to debate. 
The reflexive obstruction from Sen-
ate Republicans is not—is not—how the 
Senate is supposed to work. Not long 
ago, this Chamber operated differently, 
in a way more befitting the world’s 
greatest 
deliberative 
body: 
debate, 
compromise, amend, and legislate—all 
with the purpose of helping the Amer-
ican people, even when people’s views 
of how to do that differed. There was a 
debate and amendment. 
We need to restore that legacy. We 
need to work to restore the Senate as 
the world’s greatest deliberative body 
so we can better serve the needs of our 
Nation. Republicans blocking one bill 
after another, even from consideration, 
is not that. 
The fight to protect our fundamental 
liberties is as old as the country itself, 
and we can take note from the lessons 
of history. In the aftermath of the Civil 
War, the majorities in Congress passed 
transformative measures, like the 14th 
and 15th Amendments to the Constitu-
tion—and other civil rights bills—ex-
panding liberty to tens of millions pre-
viously deprived of it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7136 
October 21, 2021 
These are some of the crowning 
achievements of this body, but if you 
were in Congress back then, that is 
hardly how they were viewed by some 
at the time. Back then, the minority 
party refused to provide even a single 
vote to pass these laws—not even one. 
The minority condemned them as par-
tisan tools of the angry, vengeful 
north; a power grab. 
The minority refused to come to the 
table, so the majority was willing to 
act alone—act alone—to pass civil 
rights legislation. It wasn’t partisan; it 
was patriotic. Their actions made our 
democracy stronger, and they were 
willing to do what was necessary, in-
cluding going it alone to defend our 
freedoms. Today, we feel the same way. 
The question now before the Senate 
is how we will find a path forward on 
protecting our freedoms in the 21st 
century. The Members of this Chamber 
can take inspiration from the great pa-
triots of the past who put country over 
party, or they can cross their arms and 
watch as our 240-year-old experiment 
in democracy falls prey to the specters 
of authoritarian control. 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Madam President, on Build Back Bet-
ter, it has been a very productive week 
for Democrats as we inch closer to fi-
nalizing an agreement on President 
Biden’s Build Back Better plan. 
I want to thank all of my colleagues, 
especially our committee chairs, the 
Speaker, the President and his team 
for their leadership, diligence, and 
commitment 
to 
getting 
something 
done. 
The progress of this week affirms 
what we have been saying for months: 
If we stick together, if we keep work-
ing toward a legislative sweet spot, and 
if we keep our eyes on the ultimate 
goal of getting something big done for 
the American people, then we can and 
will succeed. We are closer to reaching 
that goal, and we are going to continue 
working until the job is done. 
In the end, Build Back Better is 
going to be the greatest investment in 
the American people, in our economy, 
and in the fight against climate change 
that we have seen in a long, long time. 
That is no easy feat, but we remain 
unshaken in our desire to forge ahead. 
Let’s keep going. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
KENTUCKY VETERANS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday, it was my privilege to wel-
come a distinguished group of Ken-
tucky veterans from all across the 
Commonwealth to our Nation’s Cap-
ital. Representing every branch of the 
military, more than 60 Kentuckians 
who served in World War II, Korea, and 
Vietnam traveled to Washington to 
visit the memorials built in their 
honor. 
The Honor Flight program, which co-
ordinates these trips, is finally back up 
and running after the COVID–19 pan-
demic shut down their operations last 
year. I couldn’t be more thankful for 
this organization’s seamless planning 
and execution, especially in light of 
this year’s added complications. 
The Honor Flight Bluegrass chapter 
has brought hundreds of veterans to 
Washington over the years, mirroring 
the important work of their peer orga-
nizations all across the country. De-
spite the significant logistical and fi-
nancial hurdles, the Honor Flight pro-
gram ensures every veteran can travel 
at no cost to themselves. 
I had the opportunity to meet with 
some of these Kentucky heroes and lis-
ten to their incredible stories. Their 
service 
spanned 
generations, 
con-
tinents, and conflicts. But one thread 
unites them all: a complete dedication 
to the cause of freedom and a deep love 
for our great Nation. 
As the son of a World War II veteran, 
I have a special appreciation for these 
men and women. It was a great honor 
to stand by their side as they visited 
the solemn monuments constructed to 
commemorate their sacrifice. I would 
like to express my sincere gratitude to 
those brave servicemembers and to the 
hard-working Honor Flight organizers 
and volunteers who made their visit 
possible. 
TERRORISM 
Madam President, yesterday also 
brought a sobering reminder of the 
dangers a new generation of American 
servicemembers continue to encounter 
as they follow in the footsteps of these 
heroes. U.S. personnel operating in 
Syria became the latest targets of a 
drone attack perpetrated by terrorists. 
Whether the perpetrators turn out to 
be ISIS or, more likely, loyal Iranian 
proxies, it is clear that serious threats 
are growing all across that region. 
The terrorists who seek to harm us 
and the regimes that support them 
were 
emboldened—considerably 
emboldened—by our retreat from Af-
ghanistan. Just this week, the U.S.- 
designated terrorist and Taliban Inte-
rior Minister, Haqqani, praised suicide- 
bombing Taliban terrorists with Amer-
ican and Afghan blood on their hands 
and provided—listen to this—cash re-
wards to their families. They are get-
ting a cash reward for killing Ameri-
cans. The Taliban also continues to 
hamper the evacuation of American 
citizens, Afghans who worked with 
America, and other vulnerable Afghans 
who are continuing to be under threat. 
Our allies and adversaries alike are 
wondering whether the Biden adminis-
tration intends to stand up to those 
who dare to challenge us or our allies. 
They are watching—watching closely— 
to see if America will blink in the face 
of the Taliban’s defiance or Iran’s ag-
gression. I hope the President is pre-
pared to settle this question and de-
liver on our commitments. 
HEALTHCARE 
Madam President, now on an entirely 
different matter, there is little confu-
sion about the devastating economic 
impact Democrats would bring about 
by ramming through their reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree: more taxes, 
more debt, and more painful inflation. 
But this isn’t some collection of well- 
intentioned policies whose pricetag has 
just gotten dangerously out of control; 
the policies themselves would mean 
real pain for American families—case 
in point: the heavyhanded mandates 
that would restrict choice and access 
to affordable, lifesaving healthcare. 
Democrats want to ax the private in-
surance plans that millions of Ameri-
cans have chosen and prefer. They 
want to build new Federal health pro-
grams and expand the ones that exist 
today, heaping more than $550 billion 
in new expenses on taxpayers to insure 
less than 4 million more people. Let me 
say that again. They want to build new 
Federal health programs and expand 
the ones that exist today, heaping 
more than $550 billion in new ex-
penses—new expenses—on taxpayers. 
The result: to insure less than 4 million 
more people. 
Here is the truth: The overwhelming 
majority of Americans today have ac-
cess to healthcare. Democrats just 
don’t like the private plans that most 
Americans choose. 
Then, there is the plan to heap hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in new pro-
grams and huge pools of additional peo-
ple into a Medicare system that ex-
perts say is already—already, right 
now—dangerously close to insolvency. 
This is a huge, risky leap toward Medi-
care for All at the expense of the sta-
bility and the security of the actual 
Medicare system that millions of sen-
iors rely on right now. 
Democrats want to pour cold water 
on America’s world-leading medical in-
novation sector by imposing socialist 
price caps on prescription medicines. 
In another example of Democrats’ 
magic math—magic math—the ration-
ale here is apparently that calling 
something cheaper actually makes it 
so. Calling something cheaper, they 
think, actually makes it so. 
In reality, research tells us this 
would mean fewer new treatments and 
new cures. By one analysis, these price 
controls would cause up to 20 times—20 
times—as much lost life over a decade 
as the once-in-a-century COVID pan-
demic already has. I want to say that 
again. By one analysis, these socialist 
price controls could cause up to 20 
times as much lost life over a decade as 
the once-in-a-century COVID pandemic 
already has. Suppressing innovation 
through drug socialism would literally 
cost American lives. 
Of course, they are planning to leave 
behind 
commonsense 
protections

October 21, 2021 
against taxpayer-funded abortion that 
had enjoyed consistent bipartisan sup-
port for decades. 
So, Madam President, this isn’t just 
a runaway pricetag; these policies 
themselves are terrible—terrible poli-
cies—destructive things that would 
make America’s families’ lives actu-
ally worse. And the end goal, as one 
liberal House Member said just yester-
day, is a Medicare for All system from 
before you are born until you die—from 
before you are born until you die. 
More government between families 
and affordable care. More government 
between sick patients and lifesaving 
cures. More reckless ideas from Wash-
ington Democrats. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Madam President, now on one final 
matter, earlier this week during a trip 
to South America, Secretary of State 
Blinken said that ‘‘undermining the 
independence of the courts’’ and ‘‘pack-
ing courts’’ were among ‘‘the ways that 
democracies can come undone.’’ This is 
the Secretary of State during a trip to 
South America. His warning was appar-
ently directed to neighbors in our 
hemisphere, 
but 
ironically—iron-
ically—his own fellow Democrats here 
in Washington, DC, apparently need 
the same lecture. 
Last week, President Biden’s much- 
ballyhooed Commission tasked with 
studying potential changes to the 
makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court 
issued its first findings. In some cor-
ners of the radical left, there was pre-
dictable disappointment that it had 
not more explicitly fed the flames. 
But let’s be clear: The mere creation 
of this Commission was itself a clumsy 
act of political thuggery against judi-
cial independence, and what it did 
seem to support—slapping term limits 
on Supreme Court Justices—is no less 
of a radical affront to the principles on 
which the Court was established. 
So, Madam President, curtailing the 
tenure of our Nation’s senior-most 
judges is such an obvious threat to ju-
dicial independence, it has literally 
been warned about since our Nation’s 
founding. Here is what Alexander Ham-
ilton had to say about it—and he didn’t 
mince any words—in Federalist 78. He 
warned that the judiciary is ‘‘in con-
tinual jeopardy of being overpowered, 
awed or influenced by its coordinate 
branches; and that as nothing can con-
tribute so much to its firmness and 
independence, as permanency in of-
fice’’—permanency 
in 
office—‘‘this 
quality may therefore be justly re-
garded as an indispensable ingredient 
in its constitution.’’ 
This is Alexander Hamilton, Madam 
President—‘‘an 
indispensable 
ingre-
dient’’—Alexander Hamilton on life 
tenure for judges. Our Founders in-
sisted on it because they knew that the 
branches of government with the pow-
ers to write and execute laws would be 
tempted to undermine the branch that 
could exercise nothing but its judg-
ment. 
To an alarming degree in recent 
years, we have seen Democrats in both 
the executive and the legislative suc-
cumb to exactly the temptation that 
Alexander Hamilton warned us about, 
from the brazen amicus brief from a 
group of our Senate colleagues warning 
the Court to ‘‘heal itself’’ lest it be ‘‘re-
structured,’’ 
to 
the 
bizarre 
verbal 
threats issued by the Democratic lead-
er on the steps of the Court, naming 
Justices who would ‘‘pay the price’’ for 
failing to rule the way he wanted, to 
the pseudoacademic Commission the 
President created to consider reani-
mating the ugly cadaver of court pack-
ing that his party last tried 80 years 
ago. 
So, Madam President, these are non-
sense responses to a nonexistent prob-
lem. The real problem is the shameful 
depths to which Democrats are appar-
ently willing to stoop in pursuit of 
brute power. As I have said before, sen-
sible people of all political stripes have 
an obligation to condemn this behav-
ior. But the most embarrassing con-
demnation of these tired tactics? Our 
Founders saw it coming centuries in 
advance.

VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, yester-
day, the U.S. Senate was once again 
presented with the opportunity to pro-
tect the will and the voices of the 
American people. We had a chance to 
protect the sanctity of our electoral 
processes and to preserve our democ-
racy. We had a chance to extend voting 
rights. But yesterday, for the second 
time this year, Republicans unani-
mously chose obstruction over debate, 
suppression over representation. 
All Democrats agree: The Freedom to 
Vote Act is commonsense legislation. 
It would enhance access to the ballot 
for all Americans—a right enshrined in 
our Constitution. It would enact badly 
needed election integrity reforms and 
eliminate emerging threats to our de-
mocracy. The Freedom to Vote Act 
would put in place key voter protec-
tions, such as automatic voter reg-
istration, making election day a holi-
day, and uniform early voting. It in-
cludes provisions that are broadly pop-
ular with the American people: ending 
partisan gerrymandering and removing 
special interest money from our poli-
tics. 
Every single Democrat voted for this 
bill. Democrats are united behind vot-
ing rights. Yesterday, we came to the 
floor together, ready to start the de-
bate. 
My Republican colleagues have said 
that Democrats are attempting to 
frame voting restrictions as voter sup-
pression, implying that voter suppres-
sion is some figment of our imagina-
tion, a figment of the imagination of 
those across the country who are suf-
fering from these practices. Well, to 
my 
Republican 
colleagues, 
look 
around. Nineteen States have passed 33 
new laws this year that make it harder 
to vote. We know that these laws dis-
proportionately disenfranchise Black 
voters, Brown voters, immigrant vot-
ers; voters like a mother in Georgia, 
who can’t vote because she can’t take 
time off from the job she works to 
cover the bills in the midst of a pan-
demic; or the poll worker in Arizona, 
who was arrested—arrested—for giving 
a bottle of water to a woman waiting 
in extreme heat to vote; or the person 
in Texas, who couldn’t vote because he 
didn’t have a ride to the polls. 
Stories like these are not exaggera-
tions. They are facts, and they are un-
conscionable facts. If Congress does not 
step up to the plate on voting rights, 
then we are signaling to every person 
in this country that their voice does 
not matter. We are telling them that 
we are a country that cares about rep-
resentation for some but not for all in 
our country. 
Ensuring voting rights is how we 
show, no matter a person’s background 
or race or hometown or economic sta-
tus, that their voice can be heard and 
represented. Not just the wealthy, not 
just big corporations, not just White 
Americans—everybody in our country 
is fully protected so that they can 
vote, so they can express that central 
right in our country. 
Inaction on voting rights is not an 
option. Voting rights are the people’s 
power, and the people’s power is how 
we unlock opportunity, representation, 
and justice for everyone in our Nation. 
Ensuring the right to vote is how we 
restore faith in our democracy and how 
we turn popular opinion into legisla-
tive action here on the floor of the Sen-
ate. 
This is how we take action to save 
our planet from the existential threat 
of the climate crisis that is impacting 
us right now. This is how we take ac-
tion to respond to the ongoing COVID–

19 pandemic. This is how we take ac-
tion to address racial injustice across 
our country. This is how we create the 
future for our children that we want to 
see for them. 
Republican 
obstruction 
does 
not 
mean this fight is over. Next week, the 
Senate will prepare for a vote on the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act, and here is how we can get 
this done: abolish the filibuster. Abol-
ish the filibuster. We must abolish the 
filibuster so that Democrats who were 
elected into the majority can begin to 
operate like a majority. 
The filibuster is yet another Jim 
Crow-era relic that silences the voices 
of disenfranchised people in our coun-
try, and this antiquated, parliamen-
tary rule is halting progress in our 
country. 
As legislators, our job is to both lis-
ten to the people of this country and 
act on what we have heard from our 
country. Democrats have listened, and 
we are working toward action. 
So, to my Republican colleagues, for 
the sake of your constituents, I urge 
you to join us in taking action. 
If they do not, then, in the face of 
continued obstruction, we must abolish 
the filibuster and pass voting rights 
legislation. 
The Republicans can no longer be al-
lowed to stand behind the filibuster—a 
Jim Crow-era policy, a set of rules that 
is used on the floor of the Senate to ac-
tually deny progress for every single 
part of our society. The time has 
passed. These rules are antiquated. 
They are used in a discriminatory way 
to deliberately minimize the political 
power of those who are most vulner-
able, and it must end. We must abolish 
the filibuster. 
The message we are receiving from 
the Republican leadership is that they 
are going to stand fast as a party, and 
that their political strategy is, in fact, 
disenfranchisement. It is, in fact, ob-
structing our ability to hear every sin-
gle voice in our country. 
So this is the time. This is the body 
that must act. We have to change these 
rules. These rules do not work for ev-
eryone. We know that this is our con-
stitutional time. 
Back when the first Constitution was 
being drafted, they excluded women, 
and they excluded the slave population, 
the Black population, from being able 
to vote. It was a deliberate plan that 
had to be rectified. It was rectified by 
the suffrage movement for women, and 
it was rectified by the Civil War so 
that former slaves would be given the 
right to vote. 
Well, this is our time. We see this 
moment for us to act on the filibuster. 
In the same way that the Civil War was 
the impediment, it has to be removed 
because we can see who is harmed if it 
is not. 
So I call upon everyone to begin this 
action to repeal the filibuster to ensure 
that everyone’s voice is heard in our 
country. 
I thank the Presiding Officer for this 
opportunity. 
I yield the floor.

FILTER BUBBLE TRANSPARENCY ACT AND PLAT-
FORM
ACCOUNTABILITY
AND
CONSUMER 
TRANSPARENCY ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, social 
media has become a big part of a lot of 
Americans’ 
lives: 
TikTok, 
Twitter, 
Facebook, YouTube, Instagram. 
People turn to social media for con-
nection, for entertainment, to stay on 
top of the news, for pictures of the 
grandkids, for workout routines, and 
new recipes. 
Social media offers a lot of benefits 
and opportunities, but it is becoming 
ever more clear that social media has a 
darker side as well. Social media use 
can have a negative effect on mental 
health. It can foster negative and divi-
sive engagement and serve as an outlet 
for illegal activity, from child pornog-
raphy to human trafficking. It can 
have a particularly detrimental effect 
on the still-developing psyches of teen-
agers. 
The Wall Street Journal recently 
published a series of disturbing reports 
based on the information of a Facebook 
whistleblower 
provided 
that 
high-
lighted everything from the use of 
Facebook for criminal activity in de-
veloping countries to the company’s 
own research showing the negative im-
pact Instagram can have on teenager 
girls. 
Two weeks ago, the Senate Com-
merce Committee held a hearing where 
we heard firsthand from the Facebook 
whistleblower about the concerns that 
led her to come forward. And next 
week, the Commerce Committee will 
be holding a hearing with witnesses 
from Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube, 
examining how these companies treat 
younger users. 
A recent Wall Street Journal inves-
tigation into TikTok revealed how 
easy it is for younger users to be 
bombarded with wildly inappropriate 
content, from videos promoting drug 
use to disturbing sexual content. 
One major problem with social media 
that came through, once again, in the 
recent Commerce hearing and in the 
Wall Street Journal’s recent revela-
tions is social media platforms’ use of 
algorithms to shape users’ experiences. 
Gone are the days when you logged 
into Facebook and just consumed con-
tent that had been posted chrono-
logically since your previous login. 
Now Facebook and other social media 
platforms use algorithms to shape your 
news feed and suggestions for addi-
tional content, emphasizing posts the 
platforms think you will be interested 
in and de-emphasizing other posts. 
Now, algorithms can be useful, of 
course. If you are looking for YouTube 
videos on how to build a bookshelf, you 
will probably appreciate it if YouTube 
suggests additional videos on how to 
build a bookshelf rather than videos on 
how to roast a turkey or sink the per-
fect jump shot. 
But algorithms have a problematic 
aspect as well. For starters, many peo-
ple aren’t aware just how much their 
experiences on these platforms are 
being manipulated and the negative 
emotional effects that that manipula-
tion can have. 
Disclosure on these platforms can be 
confusing or nonexistent, so individ-
uals can be largely unaware that the 
immense amount of personal data that 
social media platforms collect is being 
used to decide what posts they are 
being shown, what ads they are being 
offered, and more. 
Individuals end up being trapped in 
what has been termed the ‘‘filter bub-
ble’’—their own world of filtered search 
results and tailored content. This can 
lead to everything from political polar-
ization, as users are presented with a 
narrow, one-sided view of current af-
fairs, to addictive behavior, as the plat-
form doubles down on troubling con-
tent that users have shown an interest 
in. 
As the Wall Street Journal’s recent 
articles on Facebook and TikTok dem-
onstrate, the filter bubble can be par-
ticularly troubling in the case of 
younger social media users who may 
watch an inappropriate video and soon 
find that their feed is filled with simi-
lar material. In many ways, the filter 
bubble can and does shape a user’s 
choices and behavior. 
As the former Commerce Committee 
chairman and current ranking member 
of the Commerce Subcommittee on 
Communications, 
Media, 
and 
Broadband, I have been following these 
issues for a while and have developed 
two bipartisan bills—the Filter Bubble 
Transparency Act and the PACT Act— 
that I think would go a long way to-
ward addressing the problems posed by 
social media platforms. 
My Filter Bubble Transparency Act, 
which 
is 
cosponsored 
by 
Senators 
BLUMENTHAL
and BLACKBURN, among 
others, would allow social media users 
to opt out of the filter bubble. In other 
words, it would allow them to opt out 
of the filtered experience tailored for 
them by opaque algorithms and, in-
stead, see an unfiltered social media 
feed or search results that aren’t based 
on the vast amount of information a 
platform has on them. 
Facebook, for example, would be re-
quired to provide a clear notification 
to users that their content is being 
shaped by algorithms. Then Facebook 
would be required to provide users with 
an easily accessible option to see a 
chronological news feed instead of a 
news feed powered by opaque algo-
rithms that emphasize the posts that 
Facebook wants you to see. 
My 
Platform 
Accountability 
and 
Consumer Transparency Act—or the 
PACT Act—which I introduced with 
Senator SCHATZ, would also increase 
social media transparency. It would re-
quire sites to provide an easily digest-
ible disclosure of their content modera-
tion practices for users, and it would 
address censorship concerns by requir-
ing sites to explain their decisions to 
remove material to consumers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7140 
October 21, 2021 
Until relatively recently, sites like 
Facebook and Twitter would remove a 
user’s post without explanation and 
without an appeals process. Even as 
platforms start to shape up their act 
with regard to transparency and due 
process, it is still hard for users to get 
good information about how content is 
being moderated. 
Under the PACT Act, if a site chooses 
to remove your post, it has to tell you 
why it decided to remove your post and 
explain how your post violated the 
site’s terms of use. Then it has to pro-
vide a way for you to appeal that deci-
sion. The PACT Act would also explore 
the viability of a Federal program for 
Big Tech employees to blow the whistle 
on wrongdoing inside the companies 
where they work. 
We 
learned 
a 
lot 
from 
Frances 
Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower 
who spoke to the Commerce Com-
mittee 2 weeks ago, and I believe that 
we should encourage employees in the 
tech sector to speak up about question-
able practices of Big Tech companies 
so that we can, among other things, en-
sure Americans are fully aware of how 
social media platforms are making use 
of artificial intelligence and individ-
uals’ personal data to keep them 
hooked on their platforms. 
As I said earlier, social media offers a 
lot of benefits—I think we all acknowl-
edge that—but with the ever-increasing 
role that it plays in Americans’ lives, 
it is essential that consumers under-
stand exactly how social media plat-
forms are using their information and 
shaping the news that they see and the 
content that they interact with. 
And I am hopeful that the recent 
troubling revelations about Facebook 
and TikTok published by the Wall 
Street Journal will create an impetus 
for bipartisan action on social media 
transparency. 
I am grateful to have bipartisan co-
sponsors for both the Filter Bubble 
Transparency Act and the PACT Act, 
and I look forward to working with my 
cosponsors to get these bills passed in 
the near future. 
Big Tech has operated in the dark for 
too long. It is time to shed some light 
on content moderation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier 
this week, one of President Biden’s 
nominees for a very important office 
testified 
before 
the 
Finance 
Com-
mittee. Actually, I was a little sur-
prised. It is the nominee for Customs 
and Border Protection, but, appar-
ently, according to the arcane rules of 
the Senate, rather than the Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee or the Judiciary Com-
mittee, it was the Finance Committee 
that conducted that hearing. Perhaps 
there will be sequential referrals, but 
that surprised me a little bit. 
But I met, at least over the phone, 
Chris Magnus, who is currently the po-
lice chief in Tucson, AZ, who had been 
nominated to lead—who has been nomi-
nated to lead U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, the Agency responsible for 
managing security and trade and com-
merce at the border, among other 
places. 
Suffice it to say the Customs and 
Border Protection are overwhelmed, 
given the current numbers of migrants 
making their way to the southwestern 
border. In the last year, CBP has en-
countered more than 1.7 million mi-
grants along the southern border, the 
highest number on record. 
To be clear, this is not the fault of 
the dedicated law enforcement officials 
who are putting their lives on the line 
to protect our children and our country 
from the influx of illegal drugs but to 
also enforce our immigration laws. By 
the way, these are not policies that 
they make, these are policies that Con-
gress makes. 
These men and women make incred-
ible sacrifices to secure our border and 
try to keep our communities safe, and 
we owe them our gratitude. But we 
also owe them responsible policies and 
other support to give them a fighting 
chance to succeed at the difficult job 
we have asked them to do. 
Unfortunately, the current crisis is a 
direct result of Biden administration 
words and actions and outright refusal 
to fix the policies that are being ma-
nipulated by the transnational crimi-
nal organizations that smuggle people 
and drugs into our country. 
We have seen a steady parade of mes-
sages and policies and inactions and 
some actions in some cases, all of 
which crystalize into a clear message 
to migrants that if you come to the 
southwestern border and enter the 
country illegally, you will be likely 
able to stay. 
I am reminded of the widespread 
shoplifting issues that we have seen in 
San Francisco. Under State law, which 
has recently changed, if someone is 
caught stealing merchandise for $950 or 
less, it is only a misdemeanor, and 
rarely are those cases prosecuted. 
But—surprise—people paid attention, 
and there is no shortage of videos on-
line showing individuals committing 
criminal offenses, filling garbage bags 
full of items and walking right out the 
front door. This is what happens if you 
send the message that you can violate 
the law with impunity. 
This problem in San Francisco be-
came so expensive that a number of 
businesses, including Walgreens, for ex-
ample, started closing stores in the 
city because they just couldn’t afford 
the loss due to these thefts. 
The message is that if leaders send a 
message that says the law won’t be en-
forced, more people will break the law 
because there are no repercussions, and 
that is exactly what is happening 
today at the southern border. 
The administration has essentially 
given the playbook to the migrants and 
the cartels—the transnational criminal 
organizations that smuggle people and 
drugs into the United States. It boils 
down to this: Cross the border, sur-
render to Border Patrol, repeat these 
specific lines, and you will be released 
to the interior of the country with vir-
tually no supervision. 
And it doesn’t surprise anybody that 
a huge percentage of those individuals 
never show up for their future court 
hearing. 
Earlier this week, I asked Mr. Mag-
nus if he agreed that the administra-
tion’s stated policy of nonenforcement 
is a pull factor, encouraging more ille-
gal immigration. 
We talked about the push factors: vi-
olence, crime, a desire for a better life, 
maybe the smugglers whispering in 
your ear, ‘‘For a few bucks you can go 
stay with your family in the interior of 
the United States.’’ But he agreed that 
the nonenforcement policy of the De-
partment of Homeland Security was a 
pull factor that actually encouraged 
more illegal immigration. 
I was surprised but honestly grateful 
to hear the President’s nominee admit 
the truth. It is obvious. But it is still 
somehow a taboo statement—taboo 
statement for the Biden administration 
officials to make. 
It is undeniable that the administra-
tion’s actions have encouraged the 
surge of illegal immigration and the 
humanitarian crisis that exists on our 
border. 
One example is the process by which 
migrants undergo—the process they 
undergo before they are returned or re-
leased. Before the Biden administra-
tion existed, there was a clear process 
for migrants who crossed the border to 
claim asylum. 
The individual would be processed by 
Border Patrol and undergo a credible 
fear assessment. That is to see if they 
qualify for the statutory definition of 
asylum, which essentially determines, 
at least in a preliminary fashion, 
whether they qualify. 
If the asylum officer determines the 
applicant had a credible fear of perse-
cution, that person would then be 
issued a notice to appear for a future 
court hearing. That is a critical docu-
ment that formally commences immi-
gration court proceedings because if 
they don’t show up, a default order of 
deportation will issue. 
Well, I have heard concerns from a 
number of folks in my State about the 
fact that huge numbers of migrants are 
now being released without a notice to 
appear. Thousands of migrants have 
been released with what is called a no-
tice to report. This is a document that 
says when you get where you are going, 
turn yourself in to the local Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement office 
to start your removal proceedings. 
These migrants haven’t undergone a 
credible fear screening. We have no in-
formation on the validity of their asy-
lum claims, and it is unclear whether 
the administration has given any teeth 
to the warning that failure to contact 
the local ICE office may result in your 
arrest.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7141 
October 21, 2021 
So the Biden administration has 
made it easier for migrants to dis-
appear and melt into the great Amer-
ican landscape. 
Last month, Secretary Mayorkas, 
the Secretary of the Department of 
Homeland 
Security, 
made 
things 
worse. He issued a directive, new guid-
ance, at the end of September that 
strongly discourages Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement removal pro-
ceedings officers from carrying out 
their duties unless a migrant meets 
specific criteria. 
You can read it yourself. It talks 
about mitigating factors and aggra-
vating factors, and somehow an ICE of-
ficer, a Border Patrol agent, is sup-
posed to make an individualized deter-
mination whether this individual mi-
grant qualifies or does not qualify to be 
admitted into the United States. 
According to Secretary Mayorkas, 
recent border crossers should be a pri-
ority, but it is only if they have been 
apprehended for some other reason. He 
has basically said if your only crime is 
illegally 
entering 
into 
the 
United 
States, we are not going to detain you. 
We are not going to deport you. 
The Secretary’s guidance says that 
individuals convicted of serious crimi-
nal conduct should be a priority for re-
moval, but it is unclear what crimes 
meet the criteria. 
For example, is distributing or re-
ceiving child pornography considered a 
serious criminal conduct? What about 
crimes like wire fraud, racketeering, 
embezzlement, a whole host of other 
crimes that you or I might think of? 
It defies common sense to ask these 
law enforcement officers, charged with 
enforcing our laws, to turn a blind eye 
when they encounter individuals who 
have come here illegally and com-
mitted other crimes because those 
crimes just aren’t serious enough in 
the opinion of the bureaucracy at the 
Department of Homeland Security or 
in the Biden administration. 
I am reminded of the controversial 
directive issued by another one of 
President Biden’s nominees to enforce 
our Nation’s laws. 
Rachael Rollins has been nominated 
to serve as the U.S. attorney for Mas-
sachusetts and is currently the district 
attorney for Suffolk County, Boston. 
Shortly after taking her job as DA in 
Suffolk County, she released a memo 
outlining a dozen crimes that should be 
ignored by law enforcement. According 
to Ms. Rollins—this is a district attor-
ney—according to Ms. Rollins, individ-
uals who commit offenses like tres-
passing, shoplifting, larceny—which is 
essentially stealing—wanton or mali-
cious destruction of property or even 
possession with intent to distribute 
drugs should not be prosecuted in Suf-
folk County. 
Now, I have no issue with law en-
forcement using limited resources to 
prioritize the threats to the commu-
nity. But they can’t exempt wholesale 
classes of crimes from enforcement, 
and they certainly should not tip their 
hat to the criminals as to what crimes 
can be committed free of any con-
sequence. 
But under the Biden administration, 
unfortunately, we are seeing similar 
action. 
We are also seeing a record low num-
ber of deportations. In April, as border 
crossings hit the highest level in 2 
years—excuse me—two decades, ICE re-
moved the lowest number of illegal im-
migrants on record. So not only are 
more people coming at historic num-
bers, but historic numbers of people 
are—low numbers of people are being 
deported. 
This, again, is part of an overall mes-
sage that sends an unequivocal mes-
sage to the world that if you come to 
the United States illegally, you are 
likely to be able to get away with it. 
There is a good chance migrants will be 
released with a flimsy notice to report, 
and once that happens, they won’t be 
removed unless they are caught com-
mitting another crime. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is charged with safeguarding the 
American people and enforcing our 
laws. But its employees are largely 
handcuffed because of the Depart-
ment’s own leadership and the guid-
ance they have handed down. 
Again, there is no problem in my 
book with prioritizing the removal of 
dangerous criminals who are in the 
United States illegally. But it is an-
other thing to send a message that if 
you break some of our laws, we are 
going to enforce them; if you break 
other laws, we won’t enforce them— 
and thus encourage more and more 
people to come to the United States il-
legally. 
It isn’t clear that enforcement and 
removal operations officers will truly 
retain the discretion they need to re-
move illegal immigrants who don’t fall 
under some of the categories laid out 
by the Secretary and his guidance that 
he issued in late September. 
Considering 
everything 
we 
have 
heard from our friends across the aisle 
when it comes to immigration enforce-
ment, this radical action by the admin-
istration is not completely surprising. 
Vice President HARRIS, who was ap-
pointed by the President to deal with 
the crisis at the border, once compared 
ICE to the Ku Klux Klan. And a num-
ber of our colleagues have sided with 
radical activists who want to defund 
the police. 
With violent crime and murder rates 
on the rise across the country, it is no 
surprise that the American people 
overwhelmingly disagree with this idea 
of defunding the police. 
I was gratified to see after this 
defund movement hit—had its heyday, 
that a year later, most of the jurisdic-
tions around the country had restored 
the funding because of the disastrous 
consequences of defunding the police. 
But it is harder to resurrect a police 
department to recruit new people and 
train them than it is to defund them 
and shrink the size of the department. 
But 
now 
we 
have 
gone 
from 
defunding 
law 
enforcement 
to 
defanging law enforcement. Slowly, we 
have seen the tools law enforcement 
needs to keep our communities safe 
being taken away from them, and our 
law enforcement officers are being 
told: You cannot do your job. 
Liberal activists can throw out their 
‘‘Abolish ICE’’ posters because the ad-
ministration is effectively nullifying 
the policy from the inside. 
The reality of the situation, however 
inconvenient it may seem, is that by 
entering the United States illegally, 
migrants are violating U.S. law. Again, 
it is not something that is dictated by 
the Department of Homeland Security 
or by Border Patrol; these are laws 
that Congress has passed and previous 
Presidents have signed into law. 
As I said at the beginning, we are for-
tunate to have the hard-working men 
and women of ICE and CBP who are 
committed to enforcing our laws and 
safeguarding the American people, but 
this policy of nonenforcement and of 
providing additional pull factors to en-
courage people to illegally enter the 
United States has to be demoralizing 
to the very people we are depending 
upon to keep our country safe. 
Make no mistake, the President 
bears full responsibility for this crisis. 
He is the one who could make the dif-
ference. He could change it with the 
stroke of a pen. 
January was the only full month this 
year that President Biden was not 
President of the United States. It is 
also no coincidence that it was the 
only month in which fewer than 100,000 
migrants crossed our southern border. 
The Biden administration has made 
nonenforcement the de facto response 
to the border crisis, and as a result, an-
nual apprehensions have hit an alltime 
high. Until the Biden administration 
changes the playbook, migrants will 
continue to flood the zone using the 
very plays that the administration has 
laid out for them. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—S. RES. 134 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I would like 
to call up S. Res. 134, as amended, my 
resolution urging the President to 
bring negotiations on a free-trade 
agreement between the United States 
and the United Kingdom to a mutually 
advantageous conclusion. 
I have been working on the Senate 
floor and behind the scenes for several 
years now trying to get this measure 
adopted and a trade deal signed. Things 
are finally moving. The message to the 
President, if approved with unanimous 
consent of the Senate, could not be any 
more timely.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7142 
October 21, 2021 
President Biden recently announced 
that after a delay of more than a year, 
we are finally going to resume trade 
negotiations with the United Kingdom. 
It is not often these days that I am 
really excited about all the news com-
ing from the White House, but this one 
is absolutely thrilling to hear. I am 
very pleased with it. 
For more than 100 years, throughout 
times of great change, tumult, and un-
certainty, our partnership between the 
United States and the United King-
dom—sometimes referred to as the 
‘‘special relationship’’—has been con-
stant. Through two world wars and the 
Cold War, through centuries of eco-
nomic partnership that have forged the 
world’s single-largest bilateral trade 
and investment relationship, the UK 
has been our staunchest and our most 
loyal ally. 
Now, with the UK’s newfound ability 
to negotiate independent free-trade 
deals and the President’s commitment 
to resume negotiations on that front, 
the stars are aligned, and we have the 
opportunity to grow that relationship 
even further. This Senate resolution is 
the next step, calling on the President 
to bring those negotiations to the fin-
ish line. What could be better for 
American jobs, American prosperity, 
and American security than securing 
such a deal? This is what our country 
needs. This is what my home State of 
Utah needs. 
Let me tell you a little bit about 
what that relationship means for the 
people back in my State, back in Utah. 
Almost 11,000 Utahns are employed di-
rectly by UK companies and their sub-
sidiaries, and nearly 40,000 jobs are sup-
ported by exports from Utah to the 
United Kingdom. The United Kingdom 
is our largest export market, and we 
sent over $9 billion worth of exports 
just in 2019 alone. 
Our credit and financial services in-
dustries also thrive from our trade re-
lationships with the UK. Imagine what 
it would do for Utah and for the rest of 
the country if we made that trade even 
easier. 
In this age of great power competi-
tion with China, we need to work close-
ly with our allies renewing old friend-
ships and crafting new ones. 
As we have seen, our supply chains 
are in a precarious position, and they 
need to be redoubled and reinforced be-
fore we face the next calamity. What-
ever you might have heard, trade is one 
of the best ways to reinforce our supply 
chains, and so what we need is a pro-
liferation 
of 
free-trade 
agreements 
with countries around the globe. The 
United Kingdom would certainly be on 
that list, and, in fact, it should be chief 
among them. 
So now I ask my colleagues to join 
me, using the full voice and the author-
ity of the U.S. Senate, to urge the 
President to proceed full steam ahead 
on a deal. Throughout history, the 
partnership between our countries has 
steadied the world through some of its 
greatest perils, and it can continue to 
do so today if only we let it. The Amer-
ican and British peoples have the op-
portunity to once again join forces and 
emerge from the challenges we face 
today and to do so stronger than ever 
for the benefit of our countries and na-
tions across the globe. 
To that end, Mr. President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Finance Committee 
be discharged from further consider-
ation and the Senate now proceed to S. 
Res. 134. I further ask that the Lee sub-
stitute amendment to the resolution be 
considered and agreed to; the resolu-
tion, as amended, be agreed to; the Lee 
amendment to the preamble be consid-
ered and agreed to; the preamble, as 
amended, be agreed to; that the Lee 
amendment to the title be considered 
and agreed to; the title, as amended, be 
agreed to; and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, Senator LEE is 
right—the relationship between the 
United States and Britain is unique, 
and it is special. They are often the 
first to come to our aid when we are in 
need, when we need partners around 
the globe. So it brings me no pleasure 
to come to the floor to object to this 
resolution being passed at this time, 
partly because I think there will be a 
right time for the Senate to come to-
gether unanimously and express our 
support for a U.S.-Britain free-trade 
agreement. But I want to spend 11⁄2 
minutes telling you why this is not the 
time. 
We are having this debate because 
Britain has chosen to leave the Euro-
pean Union. Previous to Britain’s de-
parture, we were pushing for a U.S.-EU 
trade 
agreement 
that 
would 
have 
brought benefits to Britain but also to 
the rest of the continent. 
Today, we are talking about a bilat-
eral agreement because Britain is leav-
ing the European Union, but they have 
not yet fully left in the sense that 
there is an agreement connected to 
their exit that Britain has not yet ful-
filled. One of the most important as-
pects of that agreement relates to the 
Good Friday Agreement, the Good Fri-
day 
Agreement 
being 
a 
seminal 
achievement of American diplomacy 
that brought to an end decades of trou-
bles and violence in and around North-
ern Ireland. 
The UK and EU negotiated what is 
called the Northern Ireland Protocol as 
part of the EU withdrawal agreement. 
That arrangement was intended to pre-
serve the Good Friday Agreement and 
to ensure that you would never have a 
hard border between the Republic of 
Ireland and Northern Ireland. Under 
the protocol, it was agreed that North-
ern Ireland would continue to follow 
EU rules on food safety and other prod-
ucts standards to prevent those cus-
toms checks across the border. The 
checks, instead, would take place on 
goods entering Northern Ireland from 
England, Scotland, or Wales. 
The problem is that the British Gov-
ernment right now wants to change the 
deal and to get rid of most of the 
checks, to reduce customs procedures 
in order to allow goods to move more 
freely. But this has created a political 
crisis because it threatens to reerect 
that hard border that could unfortu-
nately stimulate a reemergence of con-
flict. It has already been incredibly de-
stabilizing in Northern Ireland. The 
leader of the largest unionist party has 
threatened to quit the government if 
the current protocol is not replaced. 
This is not an insignificant risk, and 
our 
priority 
should 
be, 
before 
cheerleading and championing a free- 
trade agreement, to make sure that 
Britain’s commitment to protect the 
Good Friday Agreement as part of 
their departure from the European 
Union is fulfilled. 
So I look forward to the time when 
we can come together, Republicans and 
Democrats, and support the entering 
into of discussions for a free-trade 
agreement between the United States 
and Britain, but I would submit that 
this is not the right time. Right now, 
we need to be firm in our commitment 
to make sure that the conditions of 
withdrawal from the European Union 
specifically with respect the Good Fri-
day Agreement are fulfilled, and only 
once those conditions are fulfilled 
should we as a body make that full 
commitment to this free-trade agree-
ment. 
Let’s make sure that we not do any-
thing to jeopardize what has been dec-
ades of productive peace and peace dis-
cussions in and around Northern Ire-
land. 
For that reason, I would object. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. I appreciate the insights 
shared by my friend and distinguished 
colleague, 
the 
Senator 
from 
Con-
necticut, with whom I enjoy working 
on countless issues, but I want to offer 
a little bit of additional context here. 
Senator MENENDEZ and I have worked 
together for some time now to address 
how any such trade agreement with the 
United Kingdom might take into ac-
count the obligations we have to Ire-
land under the Good Friday Agree-
ment. 
Just to be very clear, our resolution 
does not make any statement on ele-
ments of the transatlantic relationship 
outside the jurisdiction of U.S. sov-
ereignty. So this shouldn’t affect that. 
Those two things shouldn’t be tied to-
gether. 
Brexit and the debate surrounding 
the Northern Ireland Protocol are 
issues exclusively between the UK and 
the EU. This resolution is interested 
only, exclusively, in making a state-
ment on working closely with a long-
standing and stalwart ally and trade

partner. So we certainly would wel-
come a similar resolution on U.S.-EU 
trade, and I would be happy to work 
collaboratively with my friend from 
Connecticut or with any other col-
league on either side of the aisle on 
that project. 
If there are additional concerns here, 
I would love to know what those are 
immediately so that we can resolve 
this expeditiously. As I said earlier, I 
have been working on this resolution 
for at least 2 years now, and I would 
hate to see it blocked because of a 
quibble that we have already worked 
with the Foreign Relations Committee, 
the staff across the aisle on that com-
mittee, to address. I mentioned that 
this is important to my State of Utah. 
It is also important to Connecticut. 
In Connecticut, the United Kingdom 
is directly responsible for over 22,000 
jobs, and it supports another 12,000 
through Connecticut goods and serv-
ices that cross between those two coun-
tries. 
So I think this would be good for 
Connecticut. It would be good for Utah. 
It would be good for the entire country, 
and I hope we can get it done. I am dis-
appointed we weren’t able get it done 
today. I am going to keep moving 
ahead on this because it needs to hap-
pen. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 2 
minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF TANA LIN 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to support the nomi-
nation of Tana Lin to serve as judge for 
the U.S. District Court for the Western 
District of Washington. 
If confirmed, Lin would be the first 
Asian American appointed as a Federal 
judge in the State of Washington. 
Western Washington has one of the 
largest Asian-American populations in 
the country, so it is very important 
that we have her voice on the Federal 
bench to show the diversity of our 
country. 
As an Asian-American woman, the 
barriers Ms. Lin faced have inspired 
her to fight for equal justice access to 
promote diversity within the legal 
field, and she has had a passion for pub-
lic service for a long time. She started 
her legal career as a public defender 
and served as a mentor to economically 
disadvantaged youth and mothers in-
terested in pursuing law for many 
years. 
So she is extremely well qualified 
and supported by many, including the 
National Asian Pacific American Bar 
Association, the National Asian Pacific 
American Women’s Forum, the Na-
tional Legal Aid & Defender Associa-
tion, and many others; and I urge my 
colleagues to support her. 
VOTE ON LIN NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all postcloture time 
is expired. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Lin nomina-
tion? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

PANDORA PAPERS 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to sound the alarm on the na-
tional security threat that corruption 
represents and to echo the determina-
tion President Biden made earlier this 
year that corruption constitutes a core 
national security threat to the United 
States. 
Along with many of my colleagues in 
this body, I have worked long and hard 
to fight corruption, which undermines 
democracy, human rights, and the rule 
of law and is behind so many of the 
persistent problems that we seek to 
solve. 
The International Consortium of In-
vestigative Journalists—involving 150 
media outlets, including the Wash-
ington Post and the Organized Crime 
and Corruption Reporting Project— 
conducted an investigation of corrup-
tion leading to the publication of the 
Pandora Papers. 
The Pandora Papers reveal the aston-
ishing extent to which questionable fi-
nancial flows are entering our country 
and that of our allies. Those warrant 
further 
review. 
Although 
we 
had 
known that such a system of offshore 
financing exists, it is still shocking to 
see the scale of the corruption, docu-
mented in great detail by emails, con-
tracts, and other documents. 
Foreign dictators, their associates, 
and other foreign officials have stolen 
untold sums—billions of dollars—and 
moved that dirty money into our de-
mocracies, into our real estate, bank 
accounts, trusts, and other financial 
instruments. This is a profound threat 
to our national security. It hollows out 
the rule of law abroad and now threat-
ens to hollow out the rule of law at 
home. 
Foreign kleptocrats cannot do this 
alone. Although the kleptocrats may 
steal abroad, to taint our political sys-
tem with that money requires the as-
sistance of enablers—American law-
yers, accountants, trust and company 
service providers, real estate profes-
sionals, and the like—who put aside 
any moral qualms that they may have

about working for the enemies of de-
mocracy to obtain a small slice of ill- 
gotten gains. 
The Pandora Papers make clear that 
U.S. enablers apparently play an out-
sized role in helping to move stolen as-
sets from dictatorships and struggling 
democracies into consolidated democ-
racies—an appalling and corrupt trans-
fer of wealth from those who need it 
the most to those who have no need for 
it at all. 
All told, the Papers include docu-
ments from 206 U.S. trusts in 15 States 
and Washington, DC, and 22 trustee 
companies. 
While there is obviously much legiti-
mate business to be done in creating 
and managing trusts and investments— 
and we should be careful about over-
stating or generalizing without careful 
examination of each case—it appears 
that some Americans have knowingly 
played a significant role in facilitating 
corruption. 
The Papers include 300 political lead-
ers and public officials from more than 
90 countries and territories—although 
no Americans and exceedingly few 
Western Europeans. This comes as no 
surprise. The movement of corrupt 
money runs east to west, not west to 
east. It is the tragedy of the post-Cold 
War world that corruption has come 
west along with dirty money rather 
than democracy going east. 
There are names in the Papers that 
also come as no surprise, such as Vladi-
mir Putin’s cronies Konstantin Ernst 
and Gennady Timchenko. Both are in-
cluded on Alexei Navalny’s list of 35 
human rights abusers and kleptocrats. 
Timchenko is already under U.S. sanc-
tions, although Ernst is not. Now 
would be a good time to consider im-
posing sanctions on him. The Aliyevs 
of Azerbaijan also make an appearance. 
They collectively own a real estate em-
pire in London worth $700 million. A 
Chinese Communist Party official also 
was found to have used an offshore 
company to trade in U.S. stocks. 
Now, here is the good news. It doesn’t 
have to be this way. The triumph of 
global kleptocracy is not inevitable. 
We can fight back, and we are. 
Never before has there been an Amer-
ican administration so focused on 
countering such corruption or a Con-
gress so creative and aggressive in fac-
ing down the threat. President Biden is 
the first President ever to declare 
countering corruption to be a core U.S. 
national security interest. 
Congress has formed a bipartisan 
Caucus against Foreign Corruption and 
Kleptocracy. 
The 
House 
recently 
passed no fewer than six different 
counterkleptocracy measures in the 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
which included bills I authored in the 
Senate. Now, it is incumbent upon us 
to do the same in the Senate and pass 
these bills. 
First is the Combating Global Cor-
ruption Act, S. 14, which would create 
a public and tiered country-by-country 
reporting requirement on compliance 
with 
international 
anti-corruption 
norms and standards. Those countries 
in the lowest tier of this report would 
have their leadership evaluated for 
Global 
Magnitsky 
sanctions. 
Then 
there is the Global Magnitsky Reau-
thorization Act, S. 93, which would re-
authorize and enhance these critical 
sanctions 
for 
targeting 
global 
kleptocrats and human rights abus-
ers—exactly the sort of people identi-
fied by the Pandora Papers. 
Just before the recess, I introduced 
S. 2986, a new measure with Senator 
WICKER, that would require the admin-
istration to evaluate the Navalny 35 for 
Global Magnitsky Sanctions. Russian 
opposition 
leader 
Alexei 
Navalny’s 
Anti-Corruption Foundation, in a let-
ter addressed to President Joe Biden 
earlier this year, called for the United 
States to impose sanctions on dozens of 
Russian oligarchs and government offi-
cials, whom it credibly accuses of po-
litical 
persecution, 
human 
rights 
abuses, and corruption. I agree with 
the Navalny team and urge the admin-
istration to move forward on this re-
quest. 
All three of these measures have been 
included in the House version of the 
NDAA—the National Defense Author-
ization Act—and I urge my colleagues 
to include them in the Senate version 
as well. 
The Pandora Papers are a wake-up 
call to all who care about the future of 
democracy. Thirty years after the end 
of the Cold War, it is time for democ-
racies to band together and demand an 
end to these unprecedented corruptions 
that has come to the defining feature 
of the global order. We must purge the 
dirty money from our system and deny 
kleptocrats safe haven. It will take 
hard decisions and difficult reforms, 
but we can get this done. We already 
have a bipartisan commitment momen-
tum in order to accomplish these re-
sults. Now it is time that we see this 
through in the U.S. Senate. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa is recognized. 
WELFARE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a lit-
tle over 25 years ago, a Democrat 
President and a Republican Congress 
came together, to quote former Presi-
dent Clinton, ‘‘end welfare as we know 
it.’’ 
On 
a 
bipartisan 
basis, 
Congress 
passed, and President Clinton signed 
into law, a bill called the Personal Re-
sponsibility 
and 
Work 
Opportunity 
Reconciliation 
Act. 
Amongst 
other 
things, this landmark law established 
the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families—what we go by here in Wash-
ington, called the TANF Program. 
That program was replacing the pre-
vious family assistance program. 
TANF was specifically designed to 
promote work and to help struggling 
parents back onto their own two feet. 
It was very successful—about 40 per-
cent less people on welfare than before 
1996. 
The new program did this by creating 
work requirements and promoting skill 
development through education and job 
training. While critics at the time con-
tended dire consequences would re-
sult—particularly for single mothers— 
in the end, all these critics were proven 
fantastically wrong. Welfare reform 
immediately led to a precipitous de-
cline in welfare caseloads and usage. At 
the same time, the single mother labor 
force participation rate rose, and their 
incomes climbed—a step toward get-
ting out of poverty. 
A recent research shows the gains 
were not only short term but led to an 
improvement in the material well- 
being of single mothers throughout the 
following decades. Additional studies 
show welfare reform has contributed to 
higher education attainment and im-
proved food security for the following 
generation. 
The 1996 welfare reforms helped fami-
lies to enjoy the dignity of self-suffi-
ciency. It helped end the cycle of pov-
erty. It gave parents the hope of seeing 
their children grow up to be better off 
than they had been—exactly what 
every parent dreams of for their fam-
ily, particularly for their children. 
This was achieved thanks to a Demo-
crat President and a Republican Con-
gress working together for the benefit 
of those that were elected to serve. 
Now, President Biden and Senate 
Democrats want to effectively end wel-
fare reform as we know it and reconsti-
tute failed policies of the past—in 
other words, end helping people in pov-
erty by helping them get out of pov-
erty—guaranteeing a life in poverty, 
rejecting a successful reform, signed by 
Democratic President Clinton. 
So you can understand why they 
don’t want to tell the American people 
that is what they are doing. They know 
that trying to sell their proposal as the 
largest expansion of welfare history 
isn’t going to fly with the American 
people who know how well the 1996 re-
form has worked up to and including 
now. 
As an end-run around welfare re-
form—and in an attempt to garner 
broad public support—they want to co- 
opt a popular tax program for their 
own political ends or what they ideo-
logically believe in; that the govern-
ment ought to assume a more promi-
nent role in people’s lives and in the 
economy. 
That program that they are co-opt-
ing is the child tax credit. This credit 
was established on a bipartisan basis in 
1997 as a complement to welfare re-
form, with the idea of assisting parents 
as they left the welfare rolls to go to 
productive employment. 
Since then, Republicans have taken 
the lead in improving the credit as an 
anti-poverty tool that partially offset 
the burden of payroll taxes on the 
working poor. And remember, payroll 
taxes on the working poor is a regres-
sive tax. 
In 2001, as then-chairman of the Sen-
ate Finance Committee, I worked with

fellow Republicans to increase the 
credit that was set in 1997 at $500 to 
move it to $1,000. Moreover, the credit 
was made partially refundable for the 
very first time. 
This made low-income working fami-
lies eligible to receive a tax refund, 
even if they had paid no income tax— 
though they paid the payroll tax. And, 
obviously, the child tax credit helped 
offset the regressive impact on the 
working—low-income working people. 
Then, in 2017, Republicans went even 
further in improving this credit be-
cause we doubled the credit, and we in-
creased the amount that those who pay 
no Federal income tax can receive a 
tax refund. But a key feature of the 
child tax credit through these 25 years 
has always been that it is a work in-
centive. 
In order to benefit them, the tax filer 
must have at least a minimal amount 
of earned income, which basically 
means wages from employment. As you 
earn more, a larger share of the credit 
becomes refundable, partially offset-
ting the payroll taxes. 
So, now, this is what the Democrats 
have in mind: They want to turn this 
broadly popular, this bipartisan, this 
pro-work tax incentive into a govern-
ment assistance program akin to the 
old, pre-Clinton welfare program. 
What Democrats propose can no 
longer be considered a tax credit in any 
traditional sense of the word. The ben-
efit is entirely divorced from the tax 
system in every way except how the 
tax system is going to give out the ben-
efits. 
To qualify, no one in the household 
needs to work, needs to have income, 
or needs to pay any sort of Federal tax 
at all. Now, even more alarming, there 
are no job search requirements, no job 
skill development assistance, and no 
educational assistance—the foundation 
of the welfare reform of 1996, when the 
whole idea was to help people help 
themselves by either schooling or pro-
ductive employment. 
All the requirements then that apply 
to those receiving TANF under the 1996 
welfare reforms would be gone. In other 
words, their proposal provides no help 
to getting struggling parents back on 
their feet or to tackle the root causes 
of generational poverty. 
The bipartisan 1996 reform bill—ev-
erything I just said they propose is 
contrary to that basic Federal reform 
of 1996. In other words, this is a big 
step back to encouraging people into a 
lifetime in poverty. I fear the Demo-
crats’ proposal will be a poverty trap 
for far too many needy families. 
We would be reversing the gains 
made since we had this bipartisan wel-
fare reform of 1996 signed by a Demo-
cratic President. That is exactly what 
a recent University of Chicago analysis 
of the Democrats’ proposal suggests 
will occur. 
According to this study, the Demo-
crats’ child tax credit proposal would 
result in 1.5 million parents leaving the 
workforce at a time when everybody is 
crying that we need to get people back 
into the workforce if you want to keep 
inflation under control, if you want to 
keep the supply chain moving smooth-
ly. 
This analysis directly contradicts 
Democrats’ claims that their proposal 
will cut poverty in half. In fact, accord-
ing to the University of Chicago au-
thors, ‘‘deep child poverty would not 
fall at all.’’ I will bet the Democrats 
are trying to sell this on the propo-
sition that it is going to reduce child 
poverty, but not according to the Uni-
versity of Chicago scholars. In fact, it 
might even make things worse. 
That is exactly why Democrats and 
Republicans came together to reform 
welfare in 1996, because it became self- 
evident that child poverty could not be 
solved simply through money alone. 
If money alone is a solution, why are 
my Democratic colleagues willing to 
settle for only reducing child poverty 
by half? 
Why don’t they simply dedicate more 
of their foreign $4.2 trillion tax-and- 
spending spree to completely end child 
poverty? 
Is it that they believe subsidizing in-
dividuals to buy electric vehicles, as 
their bill would do, is more important 
than eradicating child poverty? 
I fully support lending a hand to fam-
ilies in need of support, but our policies 
must be focused on providing a hand 
up, not a handout. Providing assistance 
untethered from any work or job pro-
motion requirement or education or 
work training requirement is not a 
compassionate approach to helping 
people. You want to help people get in 
the world of work because only in the 
world of work can you work yourself 
up the ladder and get out of poverty. 
But being on government programs is a 
certainty of a lifetime of poverty. 
No, it is not compassionate. It is just 
the opposite. It sets up a generation of 
Americans being trapped in soul-crush-
ing government dependencies. 
I urge my colleagues to abandon 
their ill-conceived, ‘‘no strings at-
tached’’ child tax credit proposal. They 
would get a lot of Republican support— 
bipartisan support—for improving the 
child tax credit, but not this way. Do 
not yank away the ladder of oppor-
tunity 
from 
struggling 
Americans. 
Take a page out of former President 
Clinton’s playbook. Work with Repub-
licans to find a bipartisan solution that 
will actually help low-income families 
together. 
EAGLES ACT 
On another point, Mr. President, I 
would like to talk about preventing 
acts of mass violence. 
Yesterday, the shooter at the Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas High School 
tragedy in Parkland, FL, a few years 
ago, pled guilty to multiple counts of 
first-degree murder. 
There were 14 students and 3 school 
staff senselessly losing their lives in 
just a few minutes when a former stu-
dent struggling with clear behavior 
problems and mental health issues in-
discriminately opened fire. 
I hope that his guilty plea brings at 
least some sense of closure and justice 
for the victims’ families. While there is 
nothing that we can do to take back 
the terrible events of that day, we need 
to do what we can to make sure such 
horrific acts don’t ever happen again. 
That is why earlier this year, in a bi-
partisan approach, I, along with Sen-
ators 
CORTEZ
MASTO, 
COLLINS, 
MANCHIN, HASSAN, RUBIO, and SCOTT of 
Florida, introduced what we called the 
EAGLES Act. 
The EAGLES Act will help fund and 
reauthorize the U.S. Secret Service’s 
National Threat Assessment Center. It 
goes by the nickname of NTAC. An 
identical bill was introduced in the 
House by Representatives DEUTCH and 
DIAZ-BALART. 
NTAC studies targeted violence and 
helps proactively identify and manage 
threats before they result in more trag-
edies. The EAGLES Act also estab-
lishes a Safe School Initiative, a na-
tional program on school violence pre-
vention that will include expanded re-
search on school violence. 
When the Secret Service reviewed 
school shootings, it found that all 
attackers exhibited concerning behav-
iors before engaging in the act of vio-
lence. If these signs were recognized 
early enough, these attacks could have 
been stopped. 
The father of one of the Parkland 
victims and the president of Stand 
with Parkland—that is an organiza-
tion—said that NTAC has been ‘‘essen-
tial to thwarting mass shooters and 
targeted violence.’’ He also said that 
‘‘the EAGLES Act is a critical expan-
sion of the program that prioritizes 
school safety and directs key funding 
to prevent the next mass school shoot-
ing.’’ 
The EAGLES Act is a commonsense 
bill to fund and reauthorize the Secret 
Service’s NTAC that is supported by 
over 40 State attorneys general and 
representatives from both sides of the 
aisle. It is a bill that, hopefully, honors 
the lives and memories of the Parkland 
victims by ensuring that such trage-
dies don’t happen again. 
I ask and encourage all of my Senate 
colleagues to support the bill. 
I yield the floor.

CONFIRMATION OF TANA LIN 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to commend the confirmation of 
Tana Lin—a trailblazing civil rights 
lawyer and former public defender—to 
serve as U.S. District Court judge for 
the Western District of Washington in 
the Seattle courthouse. 
Ms. Lin has led a tremendous career 
fighting for civil and human rights, 
and I am very proud to have rec-
ommended her to President Biden. 
There are many reasons to be excited 
about Tana Lin’s confirmation. One of 
them that is extremely important to 
me is she will be the first-ever public 
defender serving as U.S. District Court 
judge in Washington State, and that 
really matters.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7147 
October 21, 2021 
It matters when we put a former pub-
lic defender and civil rights lawyer on 
the Federal bench. It matters quite a 
bit, I think, when a Federal judge has 
represented clients who couldn’t afford 
to hire their own lawyer. It matters 
that Ms. Lin has represented Wash-
ington State farmworkers dealing with 
wage theft. It matters that Ms. Lin 
stood up for refugees and immigrants 
against unconstitutional Executive ac-
tions, and that she had successfully 
challenged discriminatory hiring prac-
tices, and has a long career of standing 
shoulder to shoulder with working peo-
ple at every turn in her career. 
Ms. Lin’s legal qualifications are ex-
cellent. She graduated from Cornell 
University and New York University 
School of Law, working multiple jobs 
during both college and law school. She 
began her career as a public defender in 
the District of Columbia. She went on 
to work at the Civil Rights Division at 
the Department of Justice, and later 
the United States Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission. She spent 
multiple years at the Michigan Pov-
erty Law Program until she finally 
moved to Seattle. 
In Washington State, Ms. Lin cur-
rently serves as president of the Board 
of Directors of the American Civil Lib-
erties Union, and also works in private 
practice where she fights for the rights 
of employees and consumers. 
She is deeply involved in our local 
community, mentoring the next gen-
eration of lawyers and dedicating her 
time to a range of pro bono projects in 
the region. 
Ms. Lin’s legal experience is unques-
tionable, but I also believe it is impor-
tant that judges who sit on our Federal 
bench are reflective of the commu-
nities that they serve. 
Our State is home to more than 1 
million immigrants and nearly 1 mil-
lion Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers, and Ms. Lin, who emigrated 
here with her family from Taiwan at 
the age of 3, will proudly serve as 
Washington State’s first-ever Asian- 
American judge to sit on the Federal 
bench. That is a big deal. 
Ms. Lin will bring integrity, inde-
pendence, and compassion to the Se-
attle courthouse. Americans deserve a 
justice system that will uphold the 
rights 
of 
everyone, 
not 
just 
the 
wealthy 
and 
well-connected. 
Let’s 
build a more fair court system and let’s 
do that by appointing more public de-
fenders and more civil rights lawyers 
like Ms. Lin as Federal judges. 
NOMINATION OF DOUGLAS L. PARKER 
Mr. President, I would also like to 
speak about President Biden’s nominee 
to serve as Assistant Secretary of Oc-
cupational Safety and Health, Doug 
Parker. 
This pandemic has put OSHA’s crit-
ical work in the spotlight and under-
scored the Agency’s responsibility to 
act and keep our workers safe. I am so 
glad President Biden has called on the 
Agency to take the critical step of set-
ting forward an emergency temporary 
standard to require large employers to 
use appropriate tools, like vaccines and 
testing, to keep our workers safe from 
COVID–19. 
I hope to see progress on this front 
soon. Actions like that can save count-
less lives and are a reminder of why it 
is so critical we have an experienced 
leader at OSHA who will do everything 
in their power to champion worker 
safety. 
Mr. Parker’s record shows he has 
been doing that his entire career. Mr. 
Parker has worked to protect workers 
in his State throughout this pandemic 
as chief of California’s Division of Oc-
cupational Safety and Health, starting 
with his move to swiftly issue health 
guidance back in February of 2020, 
when there were only 13 cases of 
COVID–19 in the entire country. 
Even well before this pandemic, he 
had an established record fighting for 
worker safety as an attorney of the 
United Mine Workers, a partner at a 
labor and employment law firm in 
Washington, DC; and senior official at 
the Department of Labor’s Mine Safety 
and Health Administration during one 
of the best streaks of safety in the in-
dustry’s history. 
When he previously left the Depart-
ment of Labor, he went on to serve as 
the executive director of Worksafe. 
That is a legal aid nonprofit focused on 
worker health and safety. 
At every step in his career, Mr. 
Parker has been a dogged advocate for 
worker safety. I have no doubt he will 
continue when he is confirmed to lead 
OSHA. Given the urgency of this pan-
demic and the clear qualifications of 
this nominee, I hope all of our col-
leagues will join me in voting in sup-
port of Mr. Parker’s nomination. 
APPROPRIATIONS 
Mr. President, today, while I am 
here, I would also like to discuss the 
fiscal year 2022 appropriations bill for 
the Department of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Related Agencies, 
which we released this week. 
A budget is a reflection of values. 
This bill shows exactly where Demo-
crats’ values are when it comes to help 
our working families and communities. 
This bill will help us respond to this 
pandemic and other health challenges 
by 
increasing 
funding 
for 
mental 
health and substance abuse disorders; 
maternal health and family planning; 
preventive care services; biomedical re-
search, including a cutting-edge re-
search agency; and public health, with 
the largest increase to CDC’s budget 
authority in nearly two decades. This 
bill would also take the long overdue 
step of repealing the Hyde and Weldon 
amendments, which restrict people’s 
ability to exercise their constitutional 
right to abortion just based on how 
they get their insurance. 
It would invest in our children and 
students by increasing funding for 
childcare programs, early education 
programs, HBCUs and other minority- 
serving institutions, and Pell grants, 
and even doubling key funding for our 
public schools, helping to close those 
important achievement gaps and mak-
ing a quality public education avail-
able to every single child in our coun-
try. 
As we work now to rebuild our econ-
omy, this bill would strengthen our 
workforce and support workers across 
the country with increased invest-
ments in workers’ safety, the protec-
tion of workers’ rights and wages, and 
virtually every workforce development 
program. 
In short, this bill would support the 
health of our economy, our commu-
nities, and our families. 
I will be pushing to make sure we get 
this across the finish line, and I hope 
Republicans will work with us to make 
these critical, commonsense invest-
ments. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2988 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 2988 and that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration. I further 
ask unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, once again, 
I am here to oppose a bill that would 
undermine our efforts to end this pan-
demic. 
There are already State laws that ad-
dress parental consent for vaccines, but 
this bill would trample on those laws 
and the rights of young adults across 
the country who are currently able to 
get vaccinated. 
This bill does not take into account 
the rights of children who are experi-
encing homelessness but want to get 
vaccinated nor does it consider chil-
dren who are emancipated and want to 
get vaccinated, and it could make get-
ting vaccinated even harder for chil-
dren who can currently make that de-
cision 
for 
themselves 
under 
their 
States’ laws. 
We are trying to safely open schools, 
protect our communities, and end this 
pandemic that has killed over 700,000 
people. Making it harder for anyone to 
get vaccinated and protect themselves 
is not helpful. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7148 
October 21, 2021 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I am 
here on the Senate floor today, for the 
eighth time now, to oppose President 
Biden’s sweeping vaccine mandate. I 
have introduced a dozen bills to, one 
way or another, limit, clarify, or coun-
teract this still unpublished mandate. 
Now, make no mistake. I am opposed 
to the mandate categorically. I strong-
ly dispute even the contention that one 
man—the 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States—has the authority to do this. 
He doesn’t. I also fundamentally push 
back on the idea, the basic moral 
premise, that it is acceptable to put 
people in this position—to tell people 
that they have to choose between hav-
ing a job and being able to put bread on 
the table for their children, on the one 
hand, or, on the other hand, accepting 
a medical procedure that they don’t 
want either because of a religious ob-
jection or a specific medical condition 
or otherwise. 
I am categorically opposed to this 
being 
done. 
It 
shouldn’t 
be 
done 
through the Federal Government. It 
certainly shouldn’t be done by one per-
son, the President of the United States, 
who doesn’t have the authority to do 
that. 
And to highlight how concerned I am 
about this, I am coming down to the 
floor day after day to offer a different 
legislative proposal that, at a min-
imum, would make some of the effects 
of the mandate less severe, less painful, 
less cruel, less draconian. 
Each time I have come to ask the 
Senate to pass what would, frankly, be 
uncontroversial measures—that should 
be uncontroversial—and each time I 
have done that, one of my colleagues or 
another from the other side of the aisle 
has objected. 
This is unfortunate for a number of 
reasons. His mandate—which is still 
unavailable to be examined by the pub-
lic, by the way—is already showing the 
terrible power that even the threat of a 
government-imposed vaccine mandate 
wields. 
Businesses across the country are 
suspending, punishing, or firing em-
ployees who haven’t had the COVID 
shot. Even without government en-
forcement, the mere threat, the mere 
talk of the possibility of a threat of the 
mandate is making it harder for every-
day American families to put food on 
the table in increasingly difficult eco-
nomic times, times fraught with uncer-
tainty. 
This isn’t fair. This isn’t right. Deep 
down, we know it. 
Now, lest anyone try to dismiss the 
victims of this misguided and ill-found-
ed effort, these aren’t people you can 
just otherize. These aren’t people you 
could just imagine to be someone you 
don’t like, no. 
These are mothers and fathers. They 
are our neighbors. They are people 
who, like far too many Americans 
these days, are just trying to get by. I 
am going to continue to fight this for 
them. I am going to continue to push 
back on this unlawful, misguided effort 
for them. 
And, you know, in the meantime, it 
is important that we be very clear and 
that we be very consistent. In this ef-
fort, I have been supremely clear. I am 
not, in any way, shape, or form against 
the COVID–19 vaccine. I have been fully 
vaccinated. Every member of my fam-
ily has been fully vaccinated with my 
encouragement. I encourage people all 
the time, and I repeat that encourage-
ment this very moment from the U.S. 
Senate floor, that I encourage people 
to get vaccinated. 
I see the development of these vac-
cines as a miracle; one that is helping, 
and 
has 
already 
helped, 
countless 
Americans to avoid the harms of 
COVID–19. 
That doesn’t undercut the fact that 
this mandate is pushing government 
and government control far beyond 
constitutional limits and into distinc-
tively private decisions, decisions that 
belong to the American people and not 
to their government. It is why I am 
fighting against the mandate, and that 
is why I have come to the Senate floor 
eight times now, to help. 
So, today, I offered up a bill that 
should have itself been supremely 
uncontroversial. It is a reaffirmation of 
parental rights that our government 
has respected and honored from the 
very beginning. 
My Parental Consent for Vaccination 
Act would simply require that any 
COVID–19 vaccine mandate issued by 
the Federal Government must include 
a requirement that informed parental 
consent be provided before the shot is 
administered to a minor. 
What would be controversial about 
that? On what planet would we not 
want to have parents involved in that 
decision? On what planet would it be 
OK to administer a shot to a child 
without parental notification and con-
sent? 
Allow me to put this in some con-
text. Parental consent is required for 
field trips. Your child is going to the 
zoo or the park or anywhere else for a 
field trip, parental consent form. Pa-
rental consent forms are familiar to 
every parent and every child and every 
teacher in America. It is what we do. 
You are going to go on a field trip? You 
have got to have your consent form. No 
parental consent form, no field trip. 
Parental consent is required for ex-
tracurricular activities, for sports, stu-
dent government, club activities, all 
sorts of things. 
Parental consent is required before 
most schools can administer a Tylenol 
to a child; and that is, after all, the 
right approach. 
Despite what some candidates have 
said in recent political campaigns, par-
ents are people who should be in-
formed, and they should be involved in 
their children’s education and in their 
health decisions. 
There 
is 
good 
reason 
for 
this. 
Through thousands of years of human 
civilization, we have come to an under-
standing, quite appropriately, that par-
ents are simply better equipped to 
make these decisions than are other 
people; certainly better than the im-
personal arm of a government. 
Parents are people who know their 
children. Parents are people who know 
their children’s medical history. Par-
ents also love their children. Parents 
have their children’s best interests at 
heart when they make decisions re-
garding involving or affecting them. 
Government cannot do any of these 
things like parents can—not in any 
way, shape, or form. 
There is a good reason for this, and it 
is because government doesn’t love 
their children. It is not that govern-
ment categorically always means them 
harm. That is not it. Government isn’t 
a person. It is not a being. Government 
doesn’t have arms with which to em-
brace or shelter or protect their chil-
dren. Government doesn’t have a heart 
with which to love their children. 
Government, when reduced to its 
core, when we really break it down to 
what it is, government is simply 
force—politically 
permissible, 
offi-
cially sanctioned, coercive force. It is 
violence or the threatened use of vio-
lence with a badge under the cover of 
official authority. 
Now, we need government—we need 
government to protect life, liberty, and 
property. We need government to pro-
tect people from harm. But we have got 
to use it carefully. When we misappre-
hend what government is and we lose 
sight of this relationship between the 
people and the government, with the 
understanding that the government is 
there to serve the people and not the 
other way around, when we lose sight 
of the fact that government is just the 
official use of coercive force, when we 
start to revere it as some sort of benev-
olent, omnipotent, omniscient pres-
ence, bad things happen. 
Because 
government, 
while 
nec-
essary, is also dangerous; no less so 
than other things that are necessary, 
like water and like fire, like elec-
tricity, like wind, like oxygen. All 
these things, if not controlled, if not 
managed in one way or another, if not 
accounted for, can become dangerous 
and inevitably can prove deadly. 
So thank Heaven above that Al-
mighty God assigned primary care of 
children to parents and not to govern-
ment. And thank Heaven above that 
Almighty God endowed each and every 
human being with these inalienable 
rights and with the understanding that 
government is there to serve and pro-
tect them and not the other way 
around. 
Unfortunately, in some places, like 
right here in our Nation’s Capital, the 
government seems almost to have com-
pletely lost the plot. 
Right here in the District of Colum-
bia, the DC Public Schools system is 
one in which minors can receive med-
ical procedures without the school ob-
taining the consent of the parents or 
even informing the parents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7149 
October 21, 2021 
In other places across the Nation, 
this slippery slope is already leading 
governments to consider life-changing, 
school-provided 
medical 
procedures 
without parental notice or consent. 
As a parent and, for that matter, as 
a human being, as a citizen of this 
country, this thought sends shivers 
down my spine, and not at all in a good 
way. 
You see, while the Federal Govern-
ment has almost no legitimate role in 
making decisions in our primary and 
secondary education systems, these are 
to be left for States and local govern-
ments. Very, very little role for the 
Federal Government to play in that 
area at all. It is an area that should be 
left to parents and students and teach-
ers; and where government is involved, 
it nearly always is supposed to be 
State and local officials, not Federal 
ones. 
With this bill, we make sure that the 
Federal Government doesn’t endorse 
or, Heaven forbid, mandate this dan-
gerous approach to medical decisions 
for minors. It is not something that we 
should do. 
And so that is why I came here, to 
ask precisely that. I came here to ask 
that we provide assurances for parents 
and for children—once again, make no 
mistake, I am for the vaccine. I am 
categorically against the mandate. The 
mandate should not happen. The man-
date is wrong. The mandate is without 
legal foundation. It is constitutionally 
indefensible, especially when exercised 
by one person at a level of government 
not equipped to deal with these things 
who are constitutionally authorized to 
do so. 
But more than anything, the man-
date is itself immoral. It is telling 
American moms and dads that they 
have to choose between getting a vac-
cine—even if to do so would cause sig-
nificant problems for them because of a 
unique health condition, a religious ob-
jection or otherwise, they have got to 
choose between getting that unwanted 
vaccine on the one hand and losing 
their job on the other. 
Are we really going to tell them that 
to honor their own personal autonomy, 
their own ability to decide what is best 
for them, we are going to order their 
employer to fire them, rendering them 
unemployed, for the time being unem-
ployable? 
And in some cases, because of the 
way some of these companies—in an-
ticipation of the yet-to-be-announced 
mandate, some of these companies that 
have already started firing people are 
actually putting them on unpaid ad-
ministrative leave, such that they 
can’t even collect unemployment. 
This is just mean. It is mean-spirited. 
So when you peel back all the layers of 
all the constitutional arguments, of 
which there are many, you are left 
with some policy arguments. But more 
than anything else, we are left with 
some basic moral arguments, argu-
ments involving fundamental fairness. 
This is not who we are. 
Look, when we disagree, we can be— 
we should be able to disagree without 
getting someone fired. But we should 
certainly be able to disagree without 
subjecting potentially hundreds of mil-
lions of people to unemployment based 
on a personal medical decision, one 
that may have profound health con-
sequences or religious consequences to 
them personally. 
I didn’t think any of these things 
were all that controversial. I still don’t 
believe they are. If any of us could talk 
to people at random from our home 
States, whether they are from commu-
nities or families or households that 
lean left or right or somewhere else, 
most people have a basic sense of fair-
ness that transcends political ideology 
and partisan affiliation. 
That basic shared sense of funda-
mental fairness is utterly at odds with 
doing this. We are better than this. 
President Biden, you are better than 
this. President Biden, you and I don’t 
agree on everything, but I know that 
you know, President Biden, that this 
isn’t fair. Let’s not do this to the peo-
ple. 
So all I was asking today in trying to 
pass this legislation is that we reaffirm 
our commitment to supporting parents 
in making decisions for their children. 
I tried to pass that uncontroversial 
measure, and it is a source of great dis-
appointment and even some surprise 
that we couldn’t even pass that. There 
has got to be something that is a bare 
minimum. 
I appreciate the insights provided by 
my friend and distinguished colleague, 
the Senator from Washington, who, in 
objecting to the passage of this meas-
ure, shared her thoughts on why she 
opposes it. But I don’t agree with her. 
Among the arguments she raised was a 
suggestion that under existing State 
laws, there are already ways of figuring 
out when, whether, and in what cir-
cumstances parental consent might be 
required. Now, this is—this is great. 
I love federalism arguments. I am 
happy anytime someone raises a fed-
eralism argument. I think that is the 
kind of argument that doesn’t get 
made nearly enough around here be-
cause it is kind of a watershed struc-
tural issue within the Constitution, 
one that outlines the difference be-
tween Federal power and State power. 
You see, our constitutional Republic 
is one in which multiple layers of sov-
ereignty exist. States and their sub-
divisions enjoy what we call general 
police powers, the power to enact legis-
lation, generally, as States and their 
subdivisions deem appropriate for the 
protection of health, safety, and wel-
fare. States, in the absence of an ex-
pressed U.S. constitutional prohibition 
or in the absence of some restriction in 
their State constitution—States are 
presumed to have general police pow-
ers. They may enact legislation as they 
deem fit to benefit their citizens. 
We, as lawmakers in the Federal 
Government, have a narrower view. We 
have a narrower task. We have a nar-
rower area of authority. We can’t just 
enact something as Federal law simply 
because we think it is a good idea. We 
have to connect it to one of the enu-
merated powers made Federal by the 
Constitution. Most of those powers— 
not all of them but most of them—can 
be found in one portion of the Constitu-
tion written in relatively plain English 
nearly two and a half centuries ago, 
still easy to read today, still makes 
sense today—article I, section 8 makes 
that clear. We are in charge of national 
defense, regulating trade or commerce 
between the States and with foreign 
nations and with the Tribes; trade-
marks, copyrights and patents, bank-
ruptcy laws, immigration laws, natu-
ralization laws. There are a few others, 
but that is the basic gist of it—things 
that are distinctively national and des-
ignated as such by the Constitution. 
That is within our power. And every-
thing else, as the 10th amendment reaf-
firms, stating again what the original 
Constitution made clear implicitly and 
was made explicitly in the 10th amend-
ment, that powers not made Federal by 
the Constitution and not prohibited to 
the States by the Constitution ‘‘are re-
served [for] the States respectively, or 
to the people.’’ 
That is no accident that they put 
that phrase in there in the 10th amend-
ment, ‘‘or to the people.’’ 
When you reserve power to the 
States, you are, in a sense, reserving it 
for the people, and the people are the 
ultimate sovereigns. We are authorized 
to act as a Federal sovereign only in 
those narrow areas. 
So I get back to the argument that 
my friend and distinguished colleague, 
the Senator from Washington, made 
moments ago. She referred to the exist-
ence of State laws delineating cir-
cumstances in which parental consent 
for a medical procedure, including a 
vaccine, might be acceptable or appro-
priate. I appreciate the federalism ar-
gument. We ought to have more of 
those. There are far too few of them 
here. The great irony here is that this 
focuses on the fact that we shouldn’t 
be operating in this space in the first 
place. 
To the degree that she is right, as she 
absolutely is to be focusing on the dis-
tinction between State power and Fed-
eral power, that same principle argues 
a fortiori in favor of us not deciding 
this on a national level. In other words, 
if it is true, as it is, that we ought to 
be focused on State law and what State 
law requires or allows or contemplates 
or permits, heavens, yes, let State law 
apply. 
But you can’t have it both ways. If 
you are going to make this Federal, as 
the President of the United States has 
purported to do, even though it isn’t, 
then we not only may, I believe, we 
must weigh in. We must weigh in as 
the people’s elected lawmakers. It is 
our job to make policy, and it is our 
job to decide when, whether, and to 
what extent Federal policy is unaccept-
able and needs to be curtailed. So, ab-
solutely, the Senator from Washington

is absolutely right that we should be 
concerned about what State law says. 
And State law should be the beginning 
and the end of the inquiry here. 
You see, this is what is different be-
tween this vaccine mandate and others 
that have been mandated in the past. 
We have never seen one that is Fed-
eral—not applied to the American pop-
ulation as a whole, not as to the gen-
eral public. We have never seen one 
done federally, and there are good rea-
sons for this. It isn’t a Federal beast. 
So my friend from Washington has 
expressed concern for not trampling on 
those laws. She couldn’t be more right 
in the fact that we should respect 
State sovereignty and the sovereignty 
of the people. That is all the more rea-
son why we should have passed S. 2988 
today. 
S. 2988 is yet another example of a 
simple modification, that if—if—we are 
going to go down this road of a Federal 
vaccine mandate—which we should not, 
but if we were going to, at bare min-
imum, we ought to be making this a 
decision that has to be done in con-
sultation and with the approval of—not 
just the notice but also the consent of 
parents. That is not too much to ask. 
The 
American 
people 
have 
been 
asked over and over again, especially 
over the last 18 months with the 
COVID–19 pandemic, they have been 
asked to settle. They have been asked 
to settle for this brooding omni-
presence in Washington that tells them 
what to do. They have been asked to 
settle for multitrillion-dollar annual 
deficits. They have been asked to settle 
for limited freedoms. 
The American people shouldn’t have 
to settle for those things. They cer-
tainly shouldn’t have to settle for a 
Federal Government acting without 
authority through one person who has 
the ability to take away one of the 
most sacred, one of the most funda-
mental, one of the most cherished God- 
given rights, which is the right to 
make decisions involving and uniquely 
affecting their own children. 
For anyone within the sound of my 
voice or reading this, I implore you, 
don’t settle—don’t. Don’t settle for 
multitrillion-dollar 
annual 
deficits. 
Expect Congress to start to care about 
the inflation that it is causing through 
reckless spending. 
Don’t settle for this brooding omni-
presence of a Federal Government that 
is purporting to have the ability to dic-
tate every aspect of your lives. No. Ex-
pect a government that operates with-
in the space carved out by the Con-
stitution. Don’t settle for a govern-
ment that knows no boundaries around 
its authority. Expect the government 
to respect its own limitations. It is 
time to expect more, and it is time to 
expect freedom. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana is recognized. 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, the 
IRS should not have the right to spy on 
American bank accounts, period. 
We all know the list of reasons why 
the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion tax-and- 
spend spree is a disaster. It will bury 
the American people in a mountain of 
debt, crushing inflation, and require 
new taxes. The Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget, nonpartisan, 
warns that this spree could exceed $5 
trillion in terms of the deficit. 
But aside from the economic disaster 
of this tax-and-spending spree, the 
White House and congressional Demo-
crats want to force banks to report de-
tails of every American’s bank account 
to the IRS. This is nothing less than 
mass, indiscriminate government sur-
veillance of Americans, giving IRS bu-
reaucrats unfettered access to Ameri-
cans’ personal private finances, which 
is a gross invasion of privacy and an 
abuse of power. 
Democrats said that this reporting 
requirement will only target the rich. 
But, according to the New York Times, 
the Biden administration’s original 
plan was to have banks ‘‘provide data 
for accounts with total annual deposits 
or withdrawals worth more than $600.’’ 
That is $600 over the course of a year. 
I don’t know if I can think of anyone 
other than maybe the 8-year-old child 
whose parents opens an account for 
them to have an account. No one else 
who has an account will have less than 
$600 in transactions over the course of 
a year. This would lead to almost every 
American’s financial banking informa-
tion being transferred to the IRS, and 
this is what the Biden administration 
is advocating for. 
If you are a small business owner, it 
will be as if you are spied upon. If you 
are a family looking to buy your first 
home, you will be as if spied upon. If 
you sell your neighbors some fishing 
rods, hey, the IRS is going to know 
about it. If you are a single working 
mom trying to take care of your chil-
dren paying for daycare, they will 
know about it. 
But now some are saying we will 
raise the cutoff to $10,000. But that 
doesn’t mean that they will limit their 
espionage, if you will, to transactions 
over $10,000. No, this will say that any-
one with more than $10,000 transactions 
on an annual basis, cumulatively, out 
of a single bank account, that will have 
to be reported. And there is the rub. It 
changes almost nothing. Most Ameri-
cans still fall within this category and 
will be caught within the surveillance 
scheme. 
If you pay rent, you will be spied 
upon. If you buy a new car to drive 
your child safely to and from school, 
the IRS will know it. This is wrong. On 
top of a clear violation to our right to 
privacy, it is also just terrible policy. 
The reporting requirements in the $3.5 
trillion Democratic only, no Repub-
licans, tax-and-spend spree will create 
an unreasonable burden on banks and 
credit unions to report and record mas-
sive amounts of debt. 
Lastly, let’s think about why this 
bill—reconciliation, 
Democrat-only 
play—why it wants keys to your bank 
account. They need it to help spend for 
the 
$3.5 
trillion 
tax-and-spending 
spree—3.5 trillion, with a ‘‘t’’, dollars. 
They say they are only going to catch 
ultrawealthy tax cheats. That will be a 
good thing, but that is not what this 
legislation 
does. 
This 
legislation 
doesn’t look at the ultrawealthy. It 
looks at all of us. 
Now, no one wants people to cheat on 
their taxes. The people who are cheat-
ing should be caught. Republicans have 
always supported people paying the 
taxes they owe. What we oppose is a 
bill with not a single substantive com-
mittee hearing in the Senate, which 
will be pushed through on a strictly 
party-line vote, in which the American 
people’s concerns about this level of 
surveillance of their bank accounts 
goes without comment and in which 
the bill directs the IRS to know details 
of almost every single American’s bank 
account. That is what we object to. 
Democrats are showing us the harm 
government can do when they don’t 
care about citizens’ privacy. They are 
showing their real priority. It is having 
an ability to look into our lives on a 
scale previously unimaginable. It is un-
acceptable, un-American, and should 
be opposed. 
With that, I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7151 
October 21, 2021 
60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NA-
TIONAL 
RECONNAISSANCE 
OF-
FICE 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 60th anniversary 
of the National Reconnaissance Office, 
NRO. 
Born in September 1961, the present 
day National Reconnaissance Office 
was formed by agreement between the 
Secretary of Defense and the Director 
of Central Intelligence during the 
height of the Cold War. In the first dec-
ade of the Cold War, American inge-
nuity and engineering had enabled sig-
nificant advances to meet the demand 
for better reconnaissance as new, high- 
altitude aircraft like the U–2 and its 
high-speed successors, the A–12 and 
SR–71, were developed. However, even 
this new technology had its limita-
tions. This became acutely clear with 
the shoot-down of CIA pilot Francis 
Gary Powers’ U–2 in 1960. Thankfully, 
American aerospace engineers were 
also maturing new rocket and sensor 
technologies that enabled the United 
States to meet the increasing national 
security challenge of how to analyze 
Soviet forces to avert a nuclear war. 
Carrying over from the Eisenhower 
to Kennedy administrations, a group of 
remarkable Americans brought the 
foresight of combining a number of 
government satellite efforts into a sin-
gle U.S. intelligence organization that 
would become the modem NRO. These 
optical experts, chemists, physicists, 
engineers, military officers, mathe-
maticians, 
and 
photography 
entre-
preneurs recognized the value of a na-
tional policy of peacetime strategic re-
connaissance in addressing the Soviet 
threat as well as future, unforeseen, 
national security challenges. 
Assuming control of the previously 
initiated Corona photoreconnaissance 
program and following up with the 
Gambit, Hexagon, and signals intel-
ligence programs, the NRO was able to 
supply the essential intelligence infor-
mation needed to understand Soviet 
missile capabilities. The intelligence 
information the NRO provided to ana-
lysts and policymakers was critical in 
keeping nuclear tensions in check at 
the most tense points of the Cold War. 
With the arms limitation treaties of 
the 1970s, the need for the verification 
of Soviet military capabilities posed a 
new challenge for policymakers. The 
scientists and engineers of the NRO 
would once again rise to the challenge 
by designing and building the Kennen 
digital imagery satellite and other 
unique overhead technological capa-
bilities to respond to these daunting 
intelligence requirements. 
In recent times, the capabilities of 
the NRO have been vital to helping us 
better understand and react to our Na-
tion’s toughest challenges, helping to 
see the unseen across the globe, from 
the hunt for Osama bin Laden and sup-
porting 
counterterrorism 
operations 
around the globe, to helping us recover 
from natural disasters like hurricanes 
and wildfires here at home. 
While this 60th anniversary is an ap-
propriate time to celebrate the rich 
history and innovations of the NRO of 
the past, I think it is also important to 
recognize where the NRO is moving 
today and into the future and for the 
American people to understand why 
the NRO is so vital to our security. 
Our colleagues on the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence and I have 
challenged the NRO to move faster in 
building and acquiring the next genera-
tion of space reconnaissance capabili-
ties, 
including 
commercial 
tech-
nologies, as the great power competi-
tion with Russia and China takes 
shape. 
NRO is rising to this challenge. Even 
as the COVID–19 pandemic has im-
pacted so many parts of our society, 
economy, and supply chain, the NRO’s 
workforce has stayed on task. In the 
last 18 months the NRO has not only 
maintained 100 percent of its mission 
capability, but the NRO also has had a 
record series of launches and payload 
deliveries into orbit, with 8 launches 
and 16 payloads in 2020 and 2021, includ-
ing a launch from Wallops Island, in 
the Commonwealth of Virginia. I am 
also pleased to point out that the NRO 
also delivered its 12th consecutive 
clean financial audit during this pan-
demic period. 
The NRO of today and tomorrow is 
growing its partnerships in both the 
private and public sectors. Within the 
Department of Defense, the NRO is 
partnering with the U.S. Space Force 
and U.S. Space Command to integrate 
national space operations with the 
combatant commander and Federal de-
cision-maker requirements and to pro-
tect and defend our Nation’s assets in 
space. 
Likewise, the NRO is increasing en-
gagement with allies, and particularly 
the Five Eyes nations, to better lever-
age capabilities and take advantage of 
new opportunities, such as the NRO’s 
first satellite launch from an overseas 
location in 2020 from New Zealand. The 
NRO works side by side with intel-
ligence community partners such as 
the National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency to support the NGA’s imagery 
analysis mission and the National Se-
curity Agency to support the NSA’s 
analysis of signals and radio frequency 
signatures. 
In the private sector arena, the NRO 
is building off a 60-year history of 
working with U.S. industry by embrac-
ing the benefits of the growing U.S. 
commercial space industry and deliv-
ering more capabilities at a lower cost 
to the taxpayers, taking advantage of a 
full range of services from commercial 
imagery and commercial cloud services 
to commercial launch. 
Speeding innovation in anticipation 
of tomorrow’s intelligence needs, the 
NRO is working with universities and 
research institutions across the Na-
tion, looking for new ways to adapt ex-
isting capabilities and to bring online 
new technologies, The NRO is pushing 
the boundaries of advanced science and 
technology for new phenomenology and 
applications that will improve and en-
hance the NRO’s ability to provide pol-
icymakers and warfighters with ad-
vanced warning of events and provide 
critical insights into the capabilities 
and intentions of our adversaries. 
None of this work could be done 
without the women and men of the 
NRO. The NRO workforce, a blend of 
military, civilian, and contract em-
ployees, is one of the most technical 
and highly skilled in the government. 
They are engineers, scientists, IT pro-
fessionals, space system operators, and 
acquisition and program managers, 
with advanced degrees and a diversity 
of backgrounds and experiences. They 
are some of the best our Nation has to 
offer. They are the vital piece that 
makes the NRO not only a great place 
to work but makes the NRO the best 
place to work if you want to build the 
satellites, rockets, and ground systems 
that support our national security. 
From the NRO pioneers to the work-
force of today, the women and men of 
the NRO can always be counted on to 
stand true to their motto, ‘‘Supra Et 
Ultra,’’ always going Above and Be-
yond. I offer my congratulations to the 
NRO on an exceptional 60 years, and I 
look forward to seeing how the NRO 
will lead us into the next 60 years of 
space reconnaissance.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING LAD N’ LASSIE 
CHILDREN’S BOUTIQUE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week, I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize a woman-owned small business, 
Lad n’ Lassie Children’s Boutique of 
Prestonsburg, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
In 1965, Dorothy Marshal founded Lad 
n’ Lassie Children’s Boutique. Noticing 
the lack of children’s clothing retail-
ers, Dorothy seized the opportunity to 
fill a gap in the local market. Over the 
next 32 years, Dorothy’s boutique sold 
the finest children’s clothing, shoes, 
and toys to her customers. She retired 
from Lad n’ Lassie in 1997, selling the 
business to longtime family friend and 
Prestonsburg native, Cheryl Leslie. 
In 2021, Lad n’ Lassie Children’s Bou-
tique continues serving Floyd County. 
The store moved to a new location in 
downtown Prestonsburg in 1999, where 
it remains today. Under Cheryl’s lead-
ership, inventory expanded to include 
educational products and gifts. Lad n’ 
Lassie supports small businesses, fea-
turing locally and regionally made 
items. Customers are regularly greeted 
by name and treated like family. The 
store hosts community events, includ-
ing workshops with visiting artists, 
and participates in downtown holiday

events and festivals. Lad n’ Lassie is a 
go-to for local baby shower gift reg-
istries, supporting generations of Ken-
tuckians as they grow their families 
and welcome children into the world. 
Like many small business owners, 
Cheryl is actively involved in her com-
munity. She is a member of the cham-
ber of commerce and regularly meets 
with local merchants to discuss busi-
ness development. For years, Lad n’ 
Lassie has contributed to a wide range 
of local philanthropic organizations, 
sponsoring events such as the Appa-
lachian Hospice Care’s Annual Vet-
erans’ Appreciation Luncheon. They 
regularly support local school district 
events and organizations, including the 
sponsorship of dance, cheerleading, and 
sports teams. During the holiday sea-
son, Lad n’ Lassie sponsors the annual 
Prestonsburg 
Police 
Department’s 
‘‘Shop with a Cop’’ event, providing 
holiday care packages and gift for chil-
dren in need. Additionally, they spon-
sored Mountain Comprehensive Care 
Center’s—MCCC—Royal 
Christmas 
Ball, which helps children impacted by 
behavioral 
health 
issues, 
develop-
mental and intellectual disabilities, 
and addiction. Over the years, the bou-
tique’s outstanding service and com-
munity involvement have been recog-
nized by local publications and organi-
zations. Most recently, Lad n’ Lassie 
was named the ‘‘Best of the Best’’ chil-
dren’s clothing store in 2021 by the 
local newspaper, the Floyd County 
Chronicle & Times. 
Lad n’ Lassie Children’s Boutique is 
an outstanding example of the critical 
role small businesses play in uplifting 
and advocating for their communities. 
Congratulations to Cheryl and the en-
tire team at Lad n’ Lassie. I wish them 
the best of luck and look forward to 
watching their continued growth and 
success in Kentucky.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–89. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Texas urg-
ing the United States Congress to pass the I 
am Vanessa Guillen Act, legislation ensuring 
that necessary changes are made, such as 
preventing conflicts of interest, requiring 
independent investigations that are con-
ducted by trained investigators, establishing 
a confidential reporting option for sexual 
harassment that can convert to a formal 
complaint, and directing the Government 
Accountability Office to evaluate response 
procedures related to missing service mem-
bers; to the Committee on Armed Services. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 51 
Whereas, The brutal murder of Vanessa 
Guille´n and the reaction on social media 
highlight the needed support to the mili-
tary’s response to sexual harassment, sexual 
assault, and missing persons; and 
Whereas, 
Fort 
Hood 
soldier 
Vanessa 
Guille´n had been missing for more than two 
months before her remains were discovered, 
and the investigation received widespread 
attention when law enforcement identified 
the suspect, a fellow military member whom 
Guille´n was planning to formally accuse of 
sexual harassment; this prompted countless 
members of the U.S. military to share their 
personal experiences of sexual harassment 
and sexual assault on social media with the 
hashtag #IAmVanessaGuillen; and 
Whereas, A close look at current military 
laws and policies reveals concerns, including 
conflicts of interest and limited options for 
reporting sexual harassment; too many mili-
tary members have been failed by this sys-
tem, and immediate action is imperative to 
avoid another tragedy; and 
Whereas, To correct these issues, the I am 
Vanessa Guille´n Act has been introduced in 
the U.S. House of Representatives; and 
Whereas, The brave men and women who 
fight for our nation deserve access to justice, 
and Congress should listen to the service 
members calling for change in the aftermath 
of Vanessa Guille´n’s murder; now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the 87th Legislature of the 
State of Texas hereby respectfully urge the 
Congress of the United States to pass the I 
am Vanessa Guille´n Act, legislation ensuring 
that necessary changes are made, such as 
preventing conflicts of interest, requiring 
independent investigations that are con-
ducted by trained investigators, establishing 
a confidential reporting option for sexual 
harassment that can convert to a formal 
complaint, and directing the Government 
Accountability Office to evaluate response 
procedures related to missing service mem-
bers; and, be it further 
Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state 
forward official copies of this resolution to 
the president of the United States, to the 
president of the Senate and the speaker of 
the House of Representatives of the United 
States Congress, and to all the members of 
the Texas delegation to Congress with the 
request that this resolution be entered in the 
Congressional Record as a memorial to the 
Congress of the United States of America. 
POM–90. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Texas urg-
ing the Unite States Congress to repeal the 
Government Pension Offset and the Windfall 
Elimination Provision of the Social Security 
Act; to the Committee on Finance. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 17 
Whereas, Social Security is the foundation 
for retirement for tens of millions of Amer-
ican workers and their families, with many 
reporting that they rely on the program as 
their sole source of income; and 
Whereas, Two Social Security provisions, 
however, the Government Pension Offset 
(GPO), enacted in 1977, and the Windfall 
Elimination Provision (WEP), enacted in 
1983, severely and unfairly penalize recipi-
ents of public pensions; and 
Whereas, The GPO effectively prohibits 
some government retirees from collecting 
both their own pension and full Social Secu-
rity benefits as a surviving spouse; an esti-
mated 9 out of 10 public employees affected 
by the GPO lose their entire spousal benefit, 
even though their spouses paid Social Secu-
rity taxes for many years; and 
Whereas, The WEP reduces the Social Se-
curity benefit for public employees who did 
not participate in Social Security while 
working for the government, but who at 
some time in their careers were in jobs 
where they paid Social Security taxes for the 
period required to qualify for retirement 
benefits; the WEP can deprive a retiree of 
nearly $450 a month in Social Security bene-
fits duly earned by that individual; and 
Whereas, Although these provisions were 
intended to curtail the payment of windfall 
benefits to highly paid government employ-
ees, in practice they have had and continue 
to have devastating consequences for low-in-
come employees who worked for many years 
as public servants; more than two million 
government employees and retirees are af-
fected by either the GPO or the WEP or 
both, and the repercussions are felt most 
acutely in Texas and 14 other states where a 
high proportion of public employees partici-
pate in state or municipal retirement sys-
tems that do not include Social Security; 
and 
Whereas, These punitive and discrimina-
tory provisions target hundreds of thousands 
of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and 
other public servants; although the vast ma-
jority of Texas school employees participate 
in the state’s teacher retirement system, and 
therefore are not required to and do not par-
ticipate in the Social Security system, many 
Texas teachers and other public school em-
ployees nonetheless have earned Social Secu-
rity benefits on their own behalf through 
other 
employment, 
the 
WEP 
notwith-
standing, or would be entitled to spousal So-
cial Security benefits based on their spouses’ 
lifetime earnings were it not for the GPO 
penalty; these provisions cause veteran 
teachers to retire prematurely and discour-
age qualified individuals from entering the 
teaching profession at precisely the time 
that Texas and the nation face a severe 
shortage of highly qualified educators; and 
Whereas, The GPO and WEP as applied to 
public employees are unreasonable and un-
just and will cause tens of thousands of gov-
ernment retirees to experience a diminished 
quality of life or be forced to return to work 
to make up for the effects of these provi-
sions; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the 87th Legislature of the 
State of Texas hereby respectfully urge the 
Congress of the United States to repeal the 
Government Pension Offset and the Windfall 
Elimination Provision of the Social Security 
Act; and, be it further 
Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state 
forward official copies of this resolution to 
the president of the United States, to the 
president of the Senate and the speaker of 
the House of Representatives of the United 
States Congress, and to all the members of 
the Texas delegation to Congress with the 
request that this resolution be officially en-
tered in the Congressional Record as a me-
morial to the Congress of the United States 
of America. 
POM–91. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Texas urg-
ing the federal government to halt and re-
verse, effective immediately, its practice of 
assuming powers and imposing mandates and 
laws upon the states for purposes not enu-
merated by the Constitution of the United 
States of America; to the Committee on the 
Judiciary. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 12 
Whereas, Each member of the legislature 
has sworn a solemn oath to defend our 
United States and Texas Constitutions and 
takes great pride in being a citizen of the 
United States of America, where citizens 
have the right to petition their government 
for redress of grievances; and 
Whereas, Section 1, Article I, Texas Con-
stitution, states that ‘‘the perpetuity of the 
Union depend[s] upon the preservation of the 
right of local self-government, unimpaired to 
all the States’’; Section 2, Article I, declares, 
‘‘All political power is inherent in the peo-
ple, and all free governments are founded on 
their authority, and instituted for their ben-
efit. The faith of the people of Texas stands 
pledged to the preservation of a republican 
form of government, and, subject to this lim-
itation only, they have at all times the in-
alienable right to alter, reform or abolish 
their government in such manner as they 
may think expedient’’; and 
Whereas, The Tenth Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States of America 
reads as follows: ‘‘The powers not delegated 
to the United States by the Constitution, nor 
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved 
to the States respectively, or to the people’’; 
and 
Whereas, The Tenth Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States of America 
defines the total scope of federal power as 
being that specifically granted by the U.S. 
Constitution and no more; and 
Whereas, The Tenth Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States of America 
means that the federal government was cre-
ated by the states specifically to be an agent 
of the states with powers both limited and 
enumerated; and 
Whereas, Today, in 2021, the states are de-
monstrably treated as agents of the federal 
government; and 
Whereas, Many powers assumed by the fed-
eral government as well as federal laws and 
mandates are in direct violation of the Tenth 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States of America; and 
Whereas, The Tenth Amendment assures 
that we, the people of the United States of 
America and each sovereign state in the 
Union of States, have always had rights that 
the federal government may not usurp; and 
Whereas, Section 4, Article IV, of the 
United 
States 
Constitution 
says, 
‘‘The 
United States shall guarantee to every State 
in this Union a Republican Form of Govern-
ment,’’ and the Ninth Amendment states, 
‘‘The enumeration in the Constitution, of 
certain rights, shall not be construed to deny 
or disparage others retained by the people’’; 
and 
Whereas, 
The 
United 
States 
Supreme 
Court has ruled in New York v. United 
States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), that Congress may 
not simply commandeer the legislative and 
regulatory processes of the states; and

fore, be it 
Resolved, That the 87th Legislature of the

Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state 
forward official copies of this resolution to 
the president of the United States, to the 
president of the Senate and the speaker of 
the House of Representatives of the United 
States Congress, and to all members of the 
Texas delegation to Congress with the re-
quest that this resolution be officially en-
tered in the Congressional Record as a me-
morial to the Congress of the United States 
of America. 
POM–92. A resolution adopted by the House 
of Representatives of the State of Texas urg-
ing the United States Congress to pass the 
‘‘CHIPS for America Act’’ or any legislation 
that substantially increases the United 
States’ investments in semiconductor manu-
facturing and research; to the Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 1993 
Whereas, Semiconductors, often referred to 
as ‘‘integrated circuits’’ or ‘‘microchips,’’ are 
an essential component of nearly all elec-
tronic devices, including cell phones, tele-
visions, computers, automobiles, and ad-
vanced medical devices; and 
Whereas, Texas has been a world leader in 
the development of semiconductors since 
1958, when Texas Instruments engineer Jack 
Kilby invented the world’s first integrated 
circuit; and 
Whereas, The semiconductor workforce of 
Texas is the second largest in the United 
States, and it is the sixth largest manufac-
turing sector in Texas, employing 41,500 Tex-
ans with an average annual salary of $95,021; 
and 
Whereas, The United States’ share of glob-
al semiconductor manufacturing capacity 
has decreased from 37 percent in 1990 to 12 
percent today, despite a global semicon-
ductor shortage that has significantly in-
creased demand; and 
Whereas, On June 11, 2020, United States 
Senator John Cornyn and Congressman Mi-
chael McCaul introduced the Creating Help-
ful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors 
for America Act or the ‘‘CHIPS for America 
Act,’’ which proposes investments for semi-
conductor manufacturing facilities, matches 
funds for local incentives for semiconductor 
facility construction, and supports semicon-
ductor research and development; and 
Whereas, On March 31, 2021, President Jo-
seph Biden announced his support for the 
‘‘CHIPS for America Act,’’ or any proposal 
to invest $50 billion in semiconductor manu-
facturing and research; and 
Whereas, 
Semiconductor 
manufacturing 
and research have played an instrumental 
role in the economy of both Texas and the 
United States, and Congress should take 
swift action to ensure that the nation re-
mains at the forefront of this vital industry; 
now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives of the 87th Texas Legislature hereby re-
spectfully urge the Congress of the United 
States to pass the ‘‘CHIPS for America Act’’ 
or any legislation that substantially in-
creases the United States’ investments in 
semiconductor manufacturing and research; 
and, be it further 
Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state 
forward official copies of this resolution to 
the president of the United States, to the 
president of the Senate and the speaker of 
the House of Representatives of the United 
States Congress, and to all the members of 
the Texas delegation to Congress with the 
request that it be entered into the Congres-
sional record as a memorial to the Congress 
of the United States of America. 
POM–93. A resolution adopted by the Leg-
islature of Rockland County, New York, urg-

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. SHAHEEN: 
S. 3042. A bill making appropriations 
for the Departments of Commerce and 
Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
for the fiscal year ending September 30, 
2022, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Appropriations. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the fiscal year 2022 
Commerce, Justice, Science and Re-
lated Agencies, CJS, Appropriations 
Act. As chair of the CJS Appropria-
tions Subcommittee, I developed this 
bill in partnership with my vice chair-
man, the Senator from Kansas, JERRY 
MORAN. In order to draft this bill, the 
CJS Subcommittee held substantive 
hearings, considered 2,084 individual 
and group requests from 88 Senators, 
and worked in a bipartisan way to 
meet the needs of the Nation and our 
individual States. 
The end result is legislation that pro-
vides $79.7 billion to invest in impor-
tant priorities for New Hampshire and 
the Nation, including funding for key 
Federal programs that respond to the 
substance use disorder crisis, help do-
mestic and sexual violence survivors, 
invest in law enforcement programs, 
and assist Granite Staters in recov-
ering 
from 
the 
far-reaching 
con-
sequences of the pandemic. 
I am particularly pleased that the 
bill delivers the greatest funding ever

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7157 
October 21, 2021 
to Violence Against Women Act pro-
grams, as well as substantial funding 
to help communities and first respond-
ers address substance misuse and the 
climate crisis. But we can’t limit our 
action to the immediate problems of 
today; we also need an eye towards the 
future. That is why this bill also in-
vests in American competitiveness on 
the global stage—ensuring our work-
force is poised to lead in scientific in-
novation and space exploration in the 
years to come. These priorities are all 
essential to the success of families and 
communities across New Hampshire 
and our Nation, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle and the administra-
tion to see this bill signed into law. 
I would like to highlight a few spe-
cific items included in this legislation. 
Highest, funding level ever for Vio-
lence Against Women Act Programs. 
Once again, this subcommittee has pro-
vided increases to law enforcement and 
grant programs that fight gun violence 
and violent crime. For the fifth year in 
a row during my tenure on this sub-
committee, the CJS bill provides the 
highest funding level ever for Violence 
Against Women Act programs, totaling 
$760 million for the Office on Violence 
Against Women, OVW. This is a 48-per-
cent increase from last year’s funding 
level and will support training officials 
to improve services for victims, rape 
prevention programs, college campus 
violence prevention programs, domes-
tic violence hotlines and women’s shel-
ters, and transitional housing support 
services. Funding is provided for sev-
eral new initiatives, including a restor-
ative justice program, a National Deaf 
Services Line, and special assistant 
U.S. attorneys to address violence 
against women in Indian Country. 
Critical funding for Department of 
Justice anti-opioid grants. To combat 
the substance use disorder epidemic, 
the bill provides $615 million to help 
communities and first responders re-
spond to substance crises, including 
opioid addiction and drug trafficking. 
This is $73.5 million higher than the 
fiscal year 2021 funding level and in-
cludes $447 million for Comprehensive 
Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, 
grants. These grants support programs 
like drug, mental health and veteran 
treatment courts and substance use 
disorder treatment programs adminis-
tered by State and local correctional 
facilities. 
Bolstered funding to support victims 
of violent crimes and bolstered legal 
services. This year, we have heard from 
Crime Victims Fund, CVF, State ad-
ministrators and victim service pro-
viders about the impacts of lower CVF 
funding. That is why we provided $2.65 
billion of spending from the fund this 
year—$635 million more than last year. 
This fund provides direct assistance 
and programs to survivors of domestic 
violence, sexual assault, child abuse, 
human trafficking, and other violent 
crimes. But I remain concerned that 
receipts into the fund will not be able 
to sustain this needed level of spend-
ing. That is why the passage of the 
VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Vic-
tims Fund Act earlier this year was so 
important. 
The bill also provides $515 million for 
the Legal Services Corporation, which 
is the largest funder of civil legal aid 
in the country with counsel on family 
law, domestic violence, housing and fi-
nancial fraud. 
Support for law enforcement and to 
enhance police-community relations. 
Department of Justice law enforcement 
agencies are funded in the bill $23.8 bil-
lion—$1.1 billion more than last year. 
This increased funding will allow the 
hiring of additional agents, deputy 
marshals, intelligence analysts, and 
other personnel to help keep our com-
munities safe. There is also $640 mil-
lion for the Byrne-JAG Program, which 
helps law enforcement agencies in New 
Hampshire and across the country, 
strengthens the criminal justice sys-
tem, and bolsters services for victims 
of crime. Within Byrne-JAG, $416 mil-
lion will go to support State and local 
criminal justice systems, an increase 
of $56 million more than last year. Ad-
ditionally, $248 million is allocated for 
community oriented policing services, 
COPS, hiring, an increase of $11 million 
from the fiscal year 2021 level. This 
program supports State, local, and 
Tribal law enforcement agencies’ abil-
ity to hire, preserve, and/or rehire law 
enforcement 
officers 
and 
increases 
community policing efforts. 
The bill provides $283 million for 
State and local law enforcement assist-
ance and COPS Office grant programs 
to support programs that improve po-
lice-community relations. This is an 
84-percent increase from last year’s 
funding levels and will support pro-
grams on deescalation, implicit bias, 
crisis intervention, and training to re-
spond to situations where individuals 
are mentally ill or disabled. 
Increased funding for the Economic 
Development 
Administration 
and 
trade. The bill provides $10.7 billion for 
the Department of Commerce, of which 
$395 million is for the Economic Devel-
opment Administration, EDA, which 
awards infrastructure and planning 
grants to communities around the 
country. This level is an increase of $49 
million above the prior year. It is esti-
mated this funding will generate $3.5 
billion in local and private investment 
and support more than 30,000 American 
jobs this year. EDA has recently 
awarded grants to Granite State com-
munities for a wide variety of projects 
ranging from flood control infrastruc-
ture in Plymouth to economic develop-
ment projects in the Monadnock re-
gion. The EDA funding also includes $5 
million to assist communities recov-
ering from biomass plant closures. 
The bill includes $1.5 million for the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis to con-
tinue the annual assessment of the eco-
nomic value of the outdoor recreation 
industry—a key sector supporting local 
economies across New Hampshire. This 
report, which was created as a result of 
the enactment of my bipartisan legis-
lation, the Outdoor Recreation Jobs 
and Economic Impact Act, provides a 
comprehensive assessment of the role 
that outdoor recreation plays in sup-
porting jobs and economic growth, al-
lowing policymakers to craft legisla-
tion to further support the sector. The 
bill also provides $584 million for the 
International Trade Administration, 
ITA, which promotes American ex-
ports, supports small and medium-sized 
businesses, and ensures fair trade prac-
tices on the global stage. This marks a 
$43 million increase above fiscal year 
2021. 
Investments in science and to ad-
vance U.S. space exploration, The Na-
tional Science Foundation, NSF, is 
funded at $9.49 billion—$1 billion higher 
than last year’s level. This funding will 
support U.S. competitiveness in key 
areas like quantum computing, artifi-
cial intelligence, and climate science, 
as well as help build an innovative 
workforce fueled by a diverse pipeline 
of scientists and engineers. The bill 
supports the creation of a new tech-
nology directorate, similar to what the 
Senate endorsed in the U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act, to ensure that 
research is translated into the tech-
nologies and products that will drive 
economic growth for the next several 
decades. There is also $1.49 billion for 
the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, NIST, to invest in 
STEM programs that improve the com-
petitiveness of U.S. manufacturers and 
strengthen domestic supply chains, 
which is a 35-percent increase above 
fiscal year 2021. 
The bill also provides $3 million for 
NIST to continue research into the 
prevalence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances, PFAS, n firefighter per-
sonal protective equipment—marking a 
$1 million increase from last year’s 
funding. This research is a key compo-
nent of my legislation, the Guaran-
teeing Equipment Safety for Fire-
fighters Act, which was signed into law 
last year and will help to address con-
cerns regarding firefighters’ occupa-
tional exposure to PFAS chemicals. 
To support America’s continued lead-
ership in space, NASA is funded at $24.8 
billion. This is $1.5 billion higher than 
the fiscal year 2021 level and will sup-
port climate research, space missions, 
and the launch of the powerful James 
Webb Space Telescope. The bill also in-
cludes funding to support the Inter-
national Space Station and returning 
humans to the Moon. Additionally, 
within 
the 
$7.9 
billion 
for 
NASA 
Science, $825.7 million is for NASA 
Heliophysics, an increase of $74.7 mil-
lion above the fiscal year 2021 level. 
The University of New Hampshire is a 
leading heliophysics research institu-
tion, with instruments on 16 of 22 oper-
ating heliophysics missions. 
Support for ocean research and con-
servation efforts and weather sat-
ellites. The bill provides $730 million to

support National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric 
Administration, 
NOAA, 
re-
search, including critical research to 
combat the climate crisis, marking a 
19-percent increase from 2021. This 
funding will help coastal communities 
in New Hampshire and across the Na-
tion bolster their resilience to chang-
ing climate, as well as support ocean 
health and research. In addition, the 
bill invests in successful job-creating 
programs, sustainable economic devel-
opment, and environmental restora-
tion. The bill provides full funding to 
cover the full cost of at-sea monitoring 
in the New England groundfish fishery 
and an increase of $14 million for re-
search and conservation efforts to pro-
tect the endangered North Atlantic 
right whale, including $10 million to 
help defray costs paid by the lobster 
fishing 
industry 
to 
protect 
right 
whales. The bill includes $6.5 million 
specifically targeted for research re-
lated to key New England seafood spe-
cies, including to study the effects of 
climate change. 
Finally, there is $405 million to con-
tinue construction of polar weather 
satellites, which help forecast weather 
to protect property and economic secu-
rity for families in New Hampshire and 
across Nation. One-third of U.S. GDP is 
affected by climate and weather—from 
farmers in the North Country trying to 
protect livestock and crops to climate 
disasters costing billions of dollars of 
damage. 
Mr. President, these are just a few of 
the highlights of the fiscal year 2022 
CJS bill. While I wish we could con-
sider this bill under regular order, have 
a conference with the House, and enact 
it into law, I know the reality is that 
to finish the work on all 12 appropria-
tions bills by the time the continuing 
resolution runs out, we will likely be 
negotiating an omnibus. I urge my col-
leagues across the aisle to come to 
agreement with us soon on how to allo-
cate funding among the bills so the Ap-
propriations Committee can get to 
work. I look forward to working with 
Senator MORAN
and our House col-
leagues to craft a final CJS bill that 
will assist crime victims, invest in sci-
entific research, and spur innovation in 
our communities—critical needs that 
we all support.

lated services personnel, and other relevant 
school personnel; and 
(II) an individual who is assigned by a pub-
lic school to oversee and manage the recov-
ery of such student; and 
(ii) providing appropriate academic accom-
modations aimed at progressively reintro-
ducing cognitive demands on the student; 
and 
(C) encourages the use of best practices de-
signed to ensure, with respect to concus-
sions, the uniformity of safety standards, 
treatment, and management, such as— 
(i) disseminating information on concus-
sion safety and management to the public; 
and 
(ii) applying uniform best practice stand-
ards for concussion safety and management 
to all students enrolled in public schools. 
(2) POSTING

SIONS.—Each public elementary school and 
each public secondary school shall post on 
school grounds, in a manner that is visible to 
students and school personnel, and make 
publicly available on the school website, in-
formation on concussions that— 
(A) is based on peer-reviewed scientific evi-
dence (such as information made available 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention); 
(B) shall include information on— 
(i) the risks posed by sustaining a concus-
sion; 
(ii) the actions a student should take in re-
sponse to sustaining a concussion, including 
the notification of school personnel; and 
(iii) the signs and symptoms of a concus-
sion; and 
(C) may include information on— 
(i) the definition of a concussion; 
(ii) the means available to the student to 
reduce the incidence or recurrence of a con-

CONCUSSION.—If an indi-
vidual designated from among school per-
sonnel for purposes of this Act, one of whom 
must be in attendance at every school-spon-
sored activity, suspects that a student has

er or not the concussion occurred during 
school-sponsored activities, during school 
hours, on school property, or during an ath-
letic activity)— 
(A) the student shall be—

(4) RETURN TO ATHLETICS.—If a student has 
sustained a concussion (regardless of wheth-
er or not the concussion occurred during 
school-sponsored activities, during school 
hours, on school property, or during an ath-
letic activity), before such student resumes 
participation in school-sponsored athletic 
activities, the school shall receive a written 
release from a health care professional, 
that— 
(A) states that the student is capable of re-
suming participation in such activities; and 
(B) may require the student to follow a 
plan designed to aid the student in recov-

Whereas Ralph Samuelson invented water-

Whereas the 100th anniversary of this his-
toric event is July 2, 2022; 
Whereas, as documented in letters of sup-
port from the USA Water Ski & Wake Sports

person to successfully water-ski; 
Whereas this momentous event happened 
on July 2, 1922, on Lake Pepin in Lake City,

son; 
Whereas Lake Pepin is a picturesque 30- 
mile long, 3-mile wide section of the Mis-
sissippi River that is 60 miles southeast of 
the Twin Cities; 
Whereas a Sports Illustrated article dated 
August 10, 1987 also credited Mr. Samuelson 
as ‘‘The Father of Waterskiing’’ and de-
scribed him as a thrill-seeker who spent 
much of his time on Lake Pepin; and 
Whereas waterskiing is a hugely popular 
sport enjoyed by millions world-wide and 
those millions of people have Ralph Samuel-
son to thank: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate

SEC. 903. JOINT AVIATION SAFETY COUNCIL. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Preventing Loss of Aircrews 
and Necessary Equipment Act’’ or the 
‘‘PLANE Act’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Section 1087 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232; 132 Stat. 1992) 
established and authorized funding for the 
National Commission on Military Aviation 
Safety (in this subsection referred to as the 
‘‘Commission’’). 
(2) The mission of the Commission as an 
independent establishment was to undertake 
a comprehensive study of United States mili-
tary aviation mishaps that occurred between 
fiscal years 2013 and 2018 in order— 
(A) to assess the rates of military aviation 
mishaps between fiscal years 2013 and 2018 
compared to historic aviation mishap rates; 
(B) to make an assessment of the under-
lying causes contributing to accidents aris-
ing from the unexplained physiological ef-
fects of flying; 
(C) to make an assessment of causes con-
tributing to delays in aviation maintenance 
and limiting operational availability of air-
craft; 
(D) to make an assessment of the causes 
contributing to military aviation mishaps; 
and 
(E) to make recommendations on the 
modifications, if any, of safety, training, 
maintenance, personnel, or other policies re-
lated to military aviation safety. 
(3) The Commission released its report to 
the President and Congress on December 1, 
2020, and found that the United States Armed 
Forces lost a total of 224 lives, $11,600,000,000, 
and 186 aircraft to training accidents or rou-
tine operations between fiscal years 2013 and 
2020. 
(4) While the Commission conducted its 
study, 26 lives, 29 aircraft, and $2,250,000,000 
were lost. 
(5) The Commission made a number of rec-
ommendations to correct the increasing 
number of mishaps in hopes of saving pre-
cious lives and resources in the future. 
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that a confluence of factors is con-
tributing to United States military aviation 
mishaps, including— 
(1) lack of centralized joint oversight; 
(2) misunderstanding of the physiological 
effects of the human-machine interface; 
(3) byzantine planning, contracting, and 
program management processes; 
(4) continued need for predictable and reli-
able funding; 
(5) over-extension of aviation forces as a 
result of high demand and low density; 
(6) underemphasis on maintainers as pro-
fessional occupational specialties that re-
quire complex, career paths to support avia-
tion 
safety, 
readiness, 
and 
operational 
tempo; and 
(7) dwindling pilot retention.

agreement would allow [al-Qaeda and ISIS] 
to gradually rebuild their capabilities in the 
Afghanistan-Pakistan region such that they 
might be able to attack the U.S. homeland 
within eighteen to thirty-six months’’; 
(4) in the February 2020 agreement signed 
between the United States and the Taliban, 
the Taliban promised not to allow ‘‘other in-
dividuals or groups, including al-Qaeda, to 
use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the 
security of the United States and its allies’’;

been operating covertly in Afghanistan while 
still maintaining close relations with the

grade the threat from al-Qaeda, ISIS, and 
other terrorist groups; and 
(7) the United States should continue to

essary—

abiding by its commitment to break ties 
with al-Qaeda; 
(B) to determine whether al-Qaeda and 
ISIS have rebuilt their capabilities in Af-
ghanistan such that al-Qaeda and ISIS 
threaten the security of the United States 
and its allies; and 
(C) to support counterterrorism operations 
necessary to degrade the ability of al-Qaeda 
and ISIS to threaten the United States and 
its allies in the event that al-Qaeda or ISIS 
rebuilds their capabilities; and 
(2) a plan for fulfilling such requirements. 
(c) APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES OF CONGRESS

through investments to increase United 
States military presence, bolster exercises 
and training, enhance pre-positioning of

SEC. 1252. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DEFENSE AL-
LIANCES 
AND 
PARTNERSHIPS 
IN 
THE INDO-PACIFIC REGION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Interim National Security Stra-
tegic Guidance issued by the President in 
March 2021 states the following: 
(A) ‘‘For decades, our allies have stood by 
our side against common threats and adver-
saries, and worked hand-in-hand to advance 
our shared interests and values. They are a 
tremendous source of strength and a unique 
American advantage, helping to shoulder the 
responsibilities required to keep our nation 
safe and our people prosperous.’’. 
(B) ‘‘Our democratic alliances enable us to 
present a common front, produce a unified 
vision, and pool our strength to promote 
high standards, establish effective inter-
national rules, and hold countries like China 
to account.’’. 
(C) ‘‘We will reaffirm, invest in, and mod-
ernize. . .our 
alliances 
with 
Australia, 
Japan, and the Republic of Korea—which, 
along with our other global alliances and 
partnerships, are America’s greatest stra-
tegic asset.’’. 
(2) On January 19, 2021, Secretary of De-
fense Lloyd J. Austin III stated to the Com-
mittee on Armed Services of the Senate, 
‘‘[o]ur alliances and partnerships globally— 
including the defense tools at our disposal to 
engage them, and more fundamentally the 
mutual security commitments and interests 
we pursue to maintain them—are an asym-
metric strategic advantage that our com-
petitors do not possess. The strength of this 
network of defense relations cannot be taken 
for granted.’’. 
(3) On November 13, 2019, General Mark 
Milley stated to reporters, ‘‘[w]e are com-
mitted to a free and open Indo-Pacific re-
gion, and will maintain very, very close se-
curity ties with our partner nations in the 
area.’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary of Defense 
should recommit to and strengthen United 
States defense alliances and partnerships in 
the Indo-Pacific region so as to further the 
comparative advantage of the United States 
in strategic competition with the People’s 
Republic of China, including by— 
(1) enhancing cooperation with Japan, con-
sistent with the Treaty of Mutual Coopera-
tion and Security Between the United States 
of America and Japan, including by devel-
oping advanced military capabilities, fos-
tering interoperability across all domains, 
and improving sharing of information and in-
telligence; 
(2) reinforcing the United States alliance 
with the Republic of Korea, consistent with 
the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the 
United States and the Republic of Korea, in 
support of the shared objective of a peaceful 
and stable Korean Peninsula; 
(3) fostering bilateral and multilateral co-
operation with Australia, consistent with 
the Australia, New Zealand, United States 
Security Treaty, to advance shared security 
objectives and build the capabilities of 
emerging partners; 
(4) advancing United States alliances with 
the Philippines and Thailand and United 
States partnerships with other partners in 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
to enhance maritime domain awareness, pro-
mote sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
and collaborate on vetting Chinese invest-
ments in strategic technology sectors and 
critical infrastructure; 
(5) broadening the engagement of the 
United States with India, including through 
the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue— 
(A) to advance the shared objective of a 
free and open Indo-Pacific region through bi-
lateral and multilateral engagements and 
participation in military exercises, expanded 
defense trade, and collaboration on humani-
tarian aid and disaster response; and 
(B) to enable greater cooperation on mari-
time security and the threat of global 
pandemics, including COVID–19; 
(6) strengthening the United States part-
nership with Taiwan, consistent with the 
Three Communique´s, the Taiwan Relations 
Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), 
and the Six Assurances, with the goal of im-
proving Taiwan’s asymmetric defensive ca-
pabilities and promoting peaceful cross- 
strait relations; and 
(7) reinforcing the status of the Republic of 
Singapore as a Major Security Cooperation 
Partner of the United States and continuing 
to strengthen defense and security coopera-
tion between the military forces of the Re-
public of Singapore and the Armed Forces of 
the United States, including through partici-
pation in combined exercises and training, 
including the use of the Foreign Military 
Sales Training Center at Ebbing Air Na-
tional Guard Base in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

est.

STRATEGIC COMMAND STRATEGIC

(a) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) presidential decisions to consider or au-
thorize the use of nuclear weapons are of 
critical national importance, and should be 
informed by senior officials and staff who are 
intimately familiar with the likely scenarios 
in which such use might be contemplated 
and trained in the associated consultation 
and communications processes; 
(2) in a world in which emerging tech-
nologies are rapidly changing the nature of 
conflict, the considerations surrounding the 
use of nuclear weapons have become even 
more complex, challenging even those most 
experienced with the intricacies of nuclear 
employment decision-making processes, and 
that now, more than ever, effective crisis 
management requires improved senior leader 
understanding of the complexities of deter-
rence, escalation and de-escalation, and the 
range of options available across all phases 
of a crisis or conflict; 
(3) as a result of the concerns described in 
paragraph (2), section 1669 of the John S.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7236 
October 21, 2021 
McCain National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232; 132 
Stat. 2156) directed the Secretary of Defense 
to contract with a federally funded research 
and development center to conduct a study 
on the potential benefits and risks of options 
to increase the time the President has to 
make a decision regarding the employment 
of nuclear weapons; 
(4) the resulting report, completed by the 
Institute for Defense Analyses, found that, 
‘‘For the underlying system to have the best 
chance of giving a president all of the deci-
sion time the circumstances afford, trusted 
advisors cannot be starting to become famil-
iar with nuclear weapons and operations in 
the midst of a crisis. Consequently, a rel-
atively simple path to maximizing presi-
dential decision time focuses on preparing 
principals for a type of decision or situation 
that will be different than anything they 
have encountered previously in their ca-
reers.’’; 
(5) in 2020, the Defense Science Board 
reached a similar recommendation in assess-
ing the national leadership command capa-
bility, which was to ‘‘establish an exercise, 
testing, and learning regimen that is sus-
tained and provides the principal source of 
areas for continuous improvement in capa-
bilities and processes’’; 
(6) such preparation is best achieved 
through participation in realistic and oper-
ationally relevant simulations of scenarios 
in which a decision to authorize the use of 
nuclear weapons might reasonably be consid-
ered and, accordingly, senior officials, advi-
sors to the President, and staff should lever-
age any and all opportunities to improve 
their familiarity with such scenarios and 
processes; and 
(7) because of the highly classified nature 
of such activities, the most appropriate 
means of improving familiarity with such 
scenarios and processes is through participa-
tion in annual exercises organized and exe-
cuted by the United States Strategic Com-
mand and Joint Staff or through other ap-
propriate nuclear and command control ex-
ercises conducted on a regular basis. 
(b) PARTICIPATION IN UNITED STATES STRA-
TEGIC COMMAND STRATEGIC DETERRENCE EX-
ERCISES.—

‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—In the case of annual 
strategic deterrence exercises held by the 
United States Strategic Command during 
fiscal years 2022 through 2032— 
‘‘(1) the Assistant to the President for Na-
tional Security Affairs is encouraged to par-
ticipate in each such exercise that occurs 
during an even-numbered year; 
‘‘(2) the Deputy Assistant to the President 
for National Security Affairs is encouraged 
to participate in each such exercise that oc-
curs during an odd-numbered year; 
‘‘(3) the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Policy shall participate, in whole or in part, 
in each such exercise; 
‘‘(4) the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff shall participate, in whole or in part, 
in each such exercise; 
‘‘(5) appropriate senior staff of the Execu-
tive Office of the President or appropriate 
organizations supporting the White House 
relating to continuity of government activi-
ties are encouraged to participate in each 
such exercise; 
‘‘(6) appropriate general or flag officers of 
the military departments, and appropriate 
employees of Federal agencies in Senior Ex-
ecutive Service positions (as defined in sec-
tion 3132 of title 5, United States Code), shall 
participate, in whole or in part, in each such 
exercise, to provide relevant expertise to the 
Assistant to the President for National Secu-
rity Affairs and the Deputy Assistant to the 
President for National Security Affairs; and 
‘‘(7) in the case of such an exercise for 
which a unified combatant command has a 
geographic area of responsibility relevant to 
the scenario planned to be used for the exer-
cise, not fewer than two of the following in-
dividuals from that command shall partici-
pate, in whole or in part, in the exercise: 
‘‘(A) The Commander.

‘‘(C) The Director of the Joint Staff for Op-
erations. 
‘‘(D) The Director of the Joint Staff for

‘‘(B) An identification of the principal per-
sonnel participating in the exercise. 
‘‘(C) A statement of the principal findings 
resulting from the exercise that specifically 
relate to the nuclear command, control, and 
communications or senior leader decision- 
making process and a description of any defi-
ciencies in that process identified a result of 
the exercise. 
‘‘(2) Not later than 60 days after the com-
pletion of an annual strategic deterrence ex-
ercise described in subsection (a), the Sec-
retary shall transmit to the congressional 
defense committees— 
‘‘(A) an unedited copy of the report of the 
Commander submitted under paragraph (1);

SEC. 1545. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NATO SECU-
RITY AND NUCLEAR COOPERATION 
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 
THE UNITED KINGDOM. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) the United States strategic nuclear de-
terrent, and the independent strategic nu-
clear deterrents of the United Kingdom and 
the French Republic, are the supreme guar-
antee of the security of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘NATO’’) and continue to underwrite 
peace and security for all members of the 
NATO alliance; 
(2) the security of the NATO alliance also 
relies upon nuclear sharing arrangements 
that predate, and are fully consistent with, 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nu-
clear Weapons, done at Washington, London, 
and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into 
force March 5, 1960 (commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty’’); 
(3) such arrangements provide for the for-
ward deployment of United States nuclear 
weapons in Europe, along with the sup-
porting 
capabilities, 
infrastructure, 
and 
dual-capable aircraft dedicated to the deliv-
ery of United States nuclear weapons, pro-
vided by European NATO allies; 
(4) in parallel to the independent commit-
ments of the United States and the United 
Kingdom to the enduring security of NATO, 
the nuclear programs of the United States 
and the United Kingdom have enjoyed sig-
nificant collaborative benefits as a result of 
the cooperative relationship formalized in 
the Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses 
of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Pur-
poses, signed at Washington July 3, 1958, and 
entered into force August 4, 1958, between 
the United States and the United Kingdom 
(commonly referred to as the ‘‘Mutual De-
fense Agreement’’); 
(5) the unique partnership between the 
United States and the United Kingdom has 
enhanced sovereign military and scientific 
capabilities, strengthened bilateral ties, and 
resulted in the sharing of costs; 
(6) as the international security environ-
ment deteriorates and potential adversaries 
expand and enhance their nuclear forces, the 
extended deterrence commitments of the 
United Kingdom play an increasingly impor-
tant role in supporting the security interests 
of the United States and allies of the United 
States and the United Kingdom; 
(7) additionally, the extension of the nu-
clear deterrence commitments of the United

ernize its aging nuclear forces to ensure its 
ability to continue to field a nuclear deter-
rent that is safe, secure, and effective, the 
United Kingdom faces a similar challenge; 
(10) bilateral cooperation on such programs 
as the Trident II D5 weapons system, the 
common missile compartment for the future 
Dreadnought and Columbia classes of sub-
marines, and the parallel development of the 
W93/Mk7 warhead of the United States and 
the replacement warhead of the United King-
dom, will allow the United States and the 
United Kingdom to responsibly address chal-
lenges within their legacy nuclear forces in a 
cost-effective manner that— 
(A) meets national requirements and pre-
serves independent, sovereign control; 
(B) is consistent with each country’s obli-
gations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty; and 
(C) supports nonproliferation objectives; 
and 
(11) continued cooperation between the nu-
clear programs of United States and the 
United Kingdom is essential to ensuring that 
the NATO alliance continues to be supported 
by credible nuclear forces capable of pre-
serving peace, preventing coercion, and de-
terring aggression. 
SEC. 1546. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MAINTAIN-
ING DIVERSITY IN THE NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS STOCKPILE. 
(a) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) in order to ensure adequate confidence 
in the functionality of the United States nu-
clear weapons stockpile, the National Nu-
clear Security Administration must main-
tain sufficient diversity in the designs and 
types of nuclear weapons it makes available 
to the Department of Defense; 
(2) the Department of Defense should lever-
age that diversity to field a force with an ap-
propriate mix of capabilities and techno-
logical distinctiveness to ensure that the 
United States nuclear deterrent remains ca-
pable of meeting military requirements, 
even during the unlikely event of a technical 
issue that renders one particular type of nu-
clear weapon temporarily or permanently 
unsuitable for deployment; and 
(3) accordingly, it is in the national secu-
rity interest of the United States to main-
tain no fewer than two distinct types of de-
ployed nuclear weapons per leg of the nu-
clear triad in order to ensure that no poten-
tial adversary, nor United States ally, 
doubts the continuing effectiveness of the 
United States nuclear deterrent. 
(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) TYPES OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.—The term 
‘‘type’’, with respect to nuclear weapons, 
means a unique configuration of nuclear ex-
plosive packages contained within a warhead 
or gravity bomb assembly. 
(2) NUCLEAR
TRIAD.—The term ‘‘nuclear 
triad’’ means the combination of platforms 
and delivery systems that comprise the stra-
tegic nuclear forces of the United States, or-
ganized by domain (known as a ‘‘leg’’), and 
consists of the following: 
(A) For the land leg, LGM–30G Minuteman 
III intercontinental ballistic missiles, any 
associated reentry vehicles, and the planned 
replacement systems for such missiles and 
vehicles. 
(B) For the sea leg, Ohio class fleet bal-
listic missile submarines, UGM–133 Trident 
II submarine-launched ballistic missiles, any 
associated reentry vehicles, and the planned 
replacement systems for such submarines, 
missiles, and vehicles. 
(C) For the air leg, B–52H Stratofortress 
long-range 
heavy 
bombers, 
B–2A 
Spirit 
stealth 
bombers, 
AGM–86B 
air-launched 
cruise missiles, and the planned replacement 
systems for such bombers and missiles. 
SEC. 1547. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON GROUND- 
BASED STRATEGIC DETERRENT. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Minuteman III intercontinental 
ballistic missile in service as of the date of 
the enactment of this Act was first deployed 
in 1970, with a planned 10-year service life. 
(2) The Minuteman III force will begin ex-
periencing attrition and age-related compo-
nent degradation, resulting in the number of 
available intercontinental ballistic missiles 
falling below military requirement levels in 
the late 2020s. 
(3) In a 2014 analysis of alternatives, the 
Air Force concluded that replacing the Min-
uteman III missile would provide necessary 
capabilities at lower cost when compared 
with extending the service life of the Min-
uteman III missile. 
(4) The Director of Cost Assessment and 
Program Evaluation of the Department of 
Defense reviewed and validated the Air 
Force’s 2014 analysis of alternatives, stating, 
‘‘We recommend moving expeditiously to a 
Milestone A decision to ensure the timely 
fielding of the future capability. Addition-
ally, prompt action would demonstrate Air 
Force and DOD commitment to the fol-
lowing: the nuclear mission to the Airmen 
serving in the field; our allies relying on our 
umbrella nuclear deterrent coverage; the 
American public who has been following re-
cent news reports; and the world at large.’’. 
(5) In February, 2015, President Barack 
Obama’s budget requested $75,166,000 for a 
new program of record to develop a replace-
ment for the Minuteman III intercontinental 
ballistic missile, named the ground-based 
strategic deterrent. 
(6) In connection with the decision to begin 
the ground-based strategic deterrent pro-
gram in 2015, the Department of Defense did 
not undertake new engineering and produc-
tion efforts for components necessary to con-
duct a long-term life extension of the cur-
rent Minuteman system. 
(7) General Timothy Ray, former Com-
mander of Air Force Global Strike Com-
mand, testified before the Subcommittee on 
Strategic Forces of the Committee on Armed 
Services of the Senate on May 12, 2021, that 
the most recent cost estimate indicates that 
attempting a long-term life extension of the 
Minuteman III system would— 
(A) cost $38,000,000,000 more than the 
ground-based strategic deterrent program; 
(B) deliver a less-capable, less-secure, less- 
sustainable system; and 
(C) be unable to deliver life-extended sys-
tems in time to offset age-related erosion of 
the Minuteman fleet, resulting in ‘‘a signifi-
cant gap, in [intercontinental ballistic mis-
sile] capability’’. 
(8) Since 2015, and during multiple presi-
dential administrations, Congress has au-
thorized 
and 
appropriated 
more 
than 
$2,800,000,000 to develop the ground-based 
strategic deterrent. 
(9) The ground-based strategic deterrent 
program has been shown to be a cost-effec-
tive solution to maintain the land-based leg 
of the nuclear triad. 
(10) The ground-based strategic deterrent 
program has been leading the efforts of the 
Department of Air Force at digital engineer-
ing able to run millions of scenarios on the 
most cost-effective design and government- 
owned baseline. 
(11) The ground-based strategic deterrent 
will provide the United States with a mod-
ern, reliable system capable of meeting 
emergent 
challenges 
while 
lowering 
sustainment costs and also improving safety 
and security. 
(12) The Air Force’s comprehensive ap-
proach to the ground-based strategic deter-
rent will also address aging infrastructure 
and modernize nuclear command and control 
capabilities associated with the interconti-
nental ballistic missile fleet, much of which 
remains predominantly unchanged since the 
1960s. 
(13) The marked erosion of global security 
conditions and continued increase in the 
quantity and quality of foreign nuclear arse-
nals reinforces the need to modernize the 
United States nuclear deterrent, including 
the land-based leg of the nuclear triad. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) intercontinental ballistic missiles are a 
critical component of the United States nu-
clear deterrent, providing the ability to 
hedge between legs of the nuclear triad in 
the case of a component-wide failure in an-
other leg; 
(2) the continued development of the 
ground-based strategic deterrent system, and 
its eventual replacement of the Minuteman 
III intercontinental ballistic missile, is need-
ed to maintain an effective intercontinental 
ballistic missile capability into the future; 
(3) ensuring the continued effectiveness of 
the United States nuclear deterrent through 
modernization programs such as the ground- 
based strategic deterrent may also increase 
opportunities for effective arms control in 
the future by enhancing the confidence of 
the United States in the sustainability and 
effectiveness of each leg of the triad, once re-
placed with modern equivalents; and 
(4) it is in the national security interests 
of the United States that the Department of 
Defense prioritize an effective and cost-effi-
cient execution of the ground-based strategic 
deterrent program before the retirement of 
the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic 
missile in the mid-2030s.

REMEMBERING CHUCK SPANGLER 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, my thoughts and prayers go out to 
the family of Carl ‘‘Chuck’’ Spangler III, who 
passed away last week. Chuck was an impor-
tant figure in South Carolina’s manufacturing 
sector and a community leader. As President 
and CEO of the South Carolina Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership (SCMEP), he was in-
strumental in leading the organization in help-
ing provide a range of innovative strategies 
and solutions. Under his leadership, SCMEP 
was ranked a top five center by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology. South 
Carolina will forever be grateful to the positive 
impacts Chuck made creating jobs. 
Throughout his career and his nearly 25 
years with SCMEP, he assisted and trained 
thousands of manufacturers to improve their 
operations and financial performances. 
In my capacity as Congressman, I was 
grateful to have known such a talented profes-
sional and genuinely good person. He will be 
missed. I appreciate the opportunity to include 
in the RECORD the following obituary for Carl 
‘‘Chuck’’ Maynard Spangler, III: 
CHUCK SPANGLER 
AUGUST 15, 1963–OCTOBER 15, 2021 
Carl ‘‘Chuck’’ Maynard Spangler, III, 58 of 
Hawkins Road, Greer went home to be with 
his Lord and Savior on Friday, October 15, 
2021 at Atrium Health–Cabarrus, Concord. 
Born in Cleveland County, NC on August 
15, 1963, he was the son of Faye Sparks 
Spangler 
and 
the 
late 
Carl 
Maynard 
Spangler, Jr. Chuck was the President and 
CEO of SCMEP and was a member of Double 
Shoals Baptist Church. He was a graduate of 
Shelby High School where he was President 
of the Student Body and a 1985 graduate of 
NC State. Chuck was also board President 
for ASMC and severed on several boards in-
cluding the NIST MEP Leadership Team. 
In addition to his mother, he is survived by 
his high school sweetheart and wife of 37 
years, Sabrina Gibson Spangler; three sons, 
Carl 
‘‘Chip’’ 
Maynard 
Spangler, 
IV 
of 
Simpsonville, SC, Joshua Luke Spangler and 
wife, Taylor Laken Spangler of Mooresboro 
and John Michael Spangler of Greer, SC; one 
grandchild on the way; brother, Dr. Michael 
Spangler and wife, Karen of Winston-Salem 
and two sisters, Susan Duncan and husband, 
Thomas of Raleigh and Angela Anthis and 
husband, Stephen of Winston-Salem. 
Above all, Chuck loved God, his family and 
his country.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF DR. TIMUEL BLACK 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and celebrate the life and legacy of an 
extraordinary man and international icon: civil 
rights activist and educator, Dr. Timuel Dixon 
Black, Jr. 
Timuel Black was born in Birmingham, Ala-
bama in 1918. His father was a sharecropper, 
and his grandparents were formerly enslaved. 
Black’s parents moved to Chicago when he 
was an infant as part of the Great Migration of 
Black Americans moving North, seeking a bet-
ter life. 
Black grew up in Bronzeville, in the densely 
populated ‘‘Black Belt’’ where African Ameri-
cans were confined due to Chicago’s discrimi-
natory housing laws. Black attended Burke El-
ementary School and DuSable High School, 
and was drafted into the Army in 1943, where 
he fought on D–Day and in the Battle of the 
Bulge. Black visited the Buchenwald con-
centration camp shortly after it was liberated 
and later said that the atrocities he saw there 
motivated him to dedicate his life towards 
peace and justice for all people. 
Upon returning home to Chicago, Black at-
tended Roosevelt University, where he grad-
uated with a bachelor’s degree in sociology, 
and continued his education at the University 
of Chicago, earning masters degrees in both 
sociology and history. Black spent several 
years teaching high school in Chicago, Illinois 
and Gary, Indiana before becoming a pro-
fessor at Loop College, which was later re-
named Harold Washington College. 
In 1955, Black saw Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. deliver a riveting sermon on tele-
vision. He was so impressed that he imme-
diately traveled to Alabama to meet Dr. King. 
That initial meeting would lead Professor 
Black to help build support networks for Dr. 
King while Dr. King commuted between Chi-
cago and Alabama. In 1960, A. Philip Ran-
dolph enlisted Black to run the Chicago divi-
sion of the Negro American Labor Council, an 
advocacy organization that would go on to or-
ganize the landmark March on Washington for 
Jobs and Freedom. Black helped organize the 
‘‘freedom trains’’ that took thousands of 
Chicagoans to the event. More than 4,000 
Chicagoans ended up attending the March on 
Washington. Over the course of his life, Black 
worked to mobilize African American voters 
and increase African American representation 
in Illinois politics. Black ran for office a number 
of times and consistently agitated against Chi-
cago’s machine politics. In 1963, Black ran for 
alderman as part of a coalition of independent 
Black candidates running against ‘‘Silent Six’’ 
machine incumbents, notably saying that it 
was time to ‘‘end plantation politics.’’ 
In 1982, Black suggested to his childhood 
friend, Illinois U.S. Representative Harold 
Washington, that he should consider running 
for Mayor of Chicago. In the fight to combat 
rising poverty, inadequate housing, and unem-
ployment in Chicago’s African American and 
Latino communities, Black spearheaded an ef-
fort to support Washington’s campaign by reg-
istering 263,000 new voters and raising more 
than $1 million. In 1983, thanks in large part 
to Black’s efforts, Harold Washington became 
Chicago’s first Black mayor. In 1987, soon 
after Washington’s death in office, Black led a 
successful advocacy campaign to rename 
Loop College in Washington’s honor. 
A renowned author and historian, Black 
wrote an acclaimed oral history on the migra-
tion of Black Americans to Chicago from the 
South, titled ‘‘Bridges of Memory.’’ Later, in 
2019, he published a memoir titled ‘‘Sacred 
Ground: The Chicago Streets of Timuel 
Black.’’ For nearly his entire life, Timuel Black 
made the South Side of Chicago his home 
and Bronzeville his open classroom, where he 
taught and mentored future educators, com-
munity activists, and business and political 
leaders. 
Madam Speaker, Timuel Black spent every 
day of his 102 years on this earth pouring his 
best into others. 
As an educator, an activist, a civil rights 
leader, a confidante, an elder, and a sage, 
Tim gave his all to all of us. 
He was at the center—the beating heart—of 
the Black community, the Chicago community, 
the national community, and the international 
community. Black’s contributions were felt in 
countless historic events: Nelson Mandela’s 
election as President of South Africa, Harold 
Washington’s election as Mayor of Chicago, 
Barack Obama’s election as the first Black 
President of the United States, Jesse Jack-
son’s campaign for President, and Carol 
Moseley Braun’s election as the first Black 
woman in the U.S. Senate, among others. 
His loss is deeply felt in Chicago, in this Na-
tion, and indeed across the entire world. My 
thoughts and prayers are with Tim’s wife and 
family, and with all who loved and were im-
pacted by this truly great man.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
LION’S 
CLUB 
OF DILLSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA 
ON ITS 90TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to recognize the Lion’s Club of Dillsburg, 
Pennsylvania, on its 90th Anniversary. 
The Lions Club of Dillsburg was chartered 
by Lions Clubs International on November 7, 
1931, with 21 charter members. Originally 
sponsored by the York Lions Club, the 
Dillsburg Lions later sponsored more Lions 
Clubs in Boiling Springs, Mt. Holly Springs, 
Carlisle, and York Springs. Due to the Depres-
sion, membership did not grow until about 
1942, and continued to a high of 129 mem-
bers in the 1980s. 
The mission of all Lions Clubs is to serve, 
and the Dillsburg Lions have consistently 
served the Dillsburg and Northern York com-
munities throughout its 90 years of service. 
The service often took different paths—for ex-
ample, when one early success was ridding 
Dillsburg Borough of its rat problems. In the 
early 1950s, the Lions were a driving force in 
the design of the firehouse and provided 
$3,000 to construct the Firehouse and the 
Community Hall, still on South Baltimore 
Street. 
Today, membership of the Dillsburg Lions 
Club sits at 34 men and women who, through-
out the years, have supported the District, 
State and International Lions projects and ac-
tivities. Notably, the Dillsburg Lions have pro-
vided four zone chairpersons who oversaw 4 
to 5 clubs in the area, as well as two District 
Governors serving all Lions Clubs in Adams, 
Cumberland, and York Counties. 
A worldwide mission of the Lions is support 
of visually challenged people, as well as sup-
port of eyesight preservation. In this area, the 
Dillsburg Lions have assisted and spear-
headed many local ventures to assist this 
cause, both locally and abroad. The Club pays 
for eye exams and eyeglasses for adults and 
children in need, performs vision screening in 
local elementary schools, donates hundreds of 
used eyeglasses for reuse, and donates to 
and works alongside organizations like Leader 
Dogs for the Blind, and Beacon Lodge, a spe-
cial needs camp that assists the blind and vis-
ually impaired. 
Not only does the Lions support efforts to 
assist the visually challenged, but they also 
donate time and money towards projects and 
groups to benefit Dillsburg as a whole. Over 
the years, the Club constructed a cabin for 
Dillsburg Boy Scouts Troop 38, in addition to 
the public pavilion in Logan Park. 
The Lions also have funded, constructed, 
and still maintain the post messages on the 
square in Dillsburg. Through fundraising, they 
have returned between $10,000 to $30,000 to 
the community annually for the past 20 years, 
and used these funds to help strengthen the 
Dillsburg Public Library, Dillsburg Youth and 
High School Sports, Dillsburg Girl Scout 
Troops, Northern High School scholarships, 
New Hope Ministries, Northern York County 
Historical and Preservation Society, Dillsburg 
Community Fair Organization, York County 
Blind 
Association, 
Adopt-a-Highway 
road 
cleanup, Lions Hearing Research, and the 
Lions Clubs International Foundation. Through 
these ventures and their 90 years of service, 
the Lions Club of Dillsburg is an integral force 
good in our community at large and we are 
grateful for all that they do. 
I am honored and privileged to recognize 
the Lion’s Club of Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, for 
their work to strengthen our community over 
the past 90 years. Their contributions are tan-
gible legacies, as their works have made life 
better for the citizens of Dillsburg and the sur-
rounding communities. We owe a lasting debt 
of gratitude for their selfless, tireless, and 
dedicated service.

JEWISH PRAYERS ON CAPITOL 
HILL 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to include in the RECORD a statement 
from Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman, founder and 
spiritual leader of Temple Lev Tikvah in Vir-
ginia Beach, and the representative of the 
Jewish Community at the City of Chesa-
peake’s civic occasions. 
JEWISH PRAYERS ON CAPITAL HILL 
(By Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman) 
Howard Mortman, the author of an invalu-
able and unique publication entitled, ‘‘When 
Rabbis Bless Congress—The Great American 
Story of Jewish Prayers on Capitol Hill’’ is 
C–SPAN’s communications director covering 
the U.S. Congress, and a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Maryland. His family belongs to 
Temple Rodef Shalom in Falls Church, Vir-
ginia. In his publication, Mortman concludes 
in a tongue in cheek style. ‘‘So, want to hear 
rabbis cite Moses and Scripture and Torah 
and Talmud and Mishnah to legislators and 
the public? Don’t turn to Jerusalem—the 
Knesset does not open with prayer (although, 
arguably, who in the Knesset isn’t a rabbi?). 
Instead tune into Washington, where Israel’s 
chief rabbis can and have served as guest 
chaplains in Congress, just like hundreds of 
others.’’ 
While both the House and the Senate of the 
U.S. Congress have full-time clergy chap-
lains. there is a long-standing tradition of 
guest chaplains for a day which amounts to 
offering a brief prayer at the opening session 
of each chamber. Instructions are provided 
by both chaplains’ offices for the Invoca-
tion’s length, and content is submitted 
ahead of time. C–Span provides live cov-
erage, and the prayer is printed in the Con-
gressional Record—which began operating in 
1873—on the day of delivery. The guest chap-
lain is ordinarily recommended by the 
clergyperson’s Representative and Senator, 
and it is truly a memorable experience to be 
invited for such an honor. A certificate and 
photo op are included. 
I have had the privilege to offer the Invo-
cation, so far twice in each chamber, vividly 
recalling the accompanied solemnity with 
the opportunity to engage with present 
members of the august bodies. Most mem-
bers are usually not present in person, in-
stead watching from the screens in their of-
fices the offered prayer followed by the 
Pledge of Allegiance and the session’s agen-
da. unless there is a vote to take place on 
the floor. I watched from home on TV the 
deadly attack on Congress on January 6, 
2021, with the defiled desecration of both 
chambers and the rest of that magnificent 
and historic citadel of democracy known the 
world over. To witness it, though from a dis-
tance, was painfully shocking and beyond 
unfathomable, with alarming ramifications 
for American democracy and the Jewish 
community. 
As the book’s title reflects, there is much 
expressed 
pride 
in 
Jewish 
clergy 
rep-
resenting a minority participating as co- 
equal with other religious figures in a tradi-
tion some regard as violation of constitu-
tional church and state separation, though 
upheld by the Supreme Court in 1983. The 
book’s impressive treasure trove collection 
of myriad fascinating and intriguing items 
with sprinkled humor is grouped into two 
parts, including nine sections. Part One: Who 
They Are is made up of Section 1: Setting 
the Scene: A Congress at Pray. Section II: 
Who Are These Rabbis? Section III: Media 
Portrayal. Part Two: What They Say. Sec-
tion IV: Religious Awareness. Section V: 
Policy and Politics. Section VI: War, Evil, 
Terror. Section VII: Congress Institutions. 
Section VIII: America the Exceptional! Sec-
tion IX: Diversity: Including the Christians. 
Given the close proximity of the Washington 
Hebrew Congregation, the oldest synagogue 
in the capital since 1852 and chartered in 1856 
by a Congressional act, it holds the record of 
guest chaplains. The first rabbi to offer a 
prayer in Congress did so on February I, 1860. 
This was an important moment for the 
American 
Jewish 
community; 
historian 
Rabbi Dr. Bertram Korn is quoted, ‘‘In more 
than a theoretical sense, therefore this was 
the initial recognition by the House of Rep-
resentatives of the equal standing of Juda-
ism, with Christianity, as’ an American 
faith.’’ Of note, on that historic date the 
House elected its first Republican Speaker, 
New Jersey’s William Pennington, which was 
acknowledged in the prayer. The U.S. Presi-
dent then was James Buchanan. 
Rabbi Edward Calisch of Congregation 
Beth Ahavah in Richmond, Virginia, was the 
first American—born rabbi to offer a prayer 
in the House on April 6, 1892. The iconic 
Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise was the first rabbi 
to offer a prayer in the Senate on May 21, 
1870. His biennial birth was recognized with a 
special resolution in the Senate on April 4, 
2019. Rabbi Sally Priesand of New York’s 
Steven Wise Free Synagogue was the first 
woman and first female rabbi to invoke in 
the House on October 23, 1973. Her sponsor 
was the Congresswoman Bella Abzug. In the 
Senate, the first woman was Rev. Wilmina 
Roland Smith, a presbyterian minister, on 
July 8, 1971. The first woman rabbi blessing 
the Senate was Rabbi Dena Feingold on 
April 20, 1994, sponsored by her brother, 
Democratic Senator Russ Feingold of Wis-
consin. 
Though the Jews only make up 2.2 percent 
of the American populace, 35 rabbis out of 
527 House guest chaplains participated from 
September 2006 to September 2016. As of Feb-
ruary 2020, 441 rabbis delivered prayers, with 
an average rate of 7.5 percent since WWII, 
and 11 percent respectively in 2018 and 2019. 
In Spring 2018, the number of rabbinic invo-
cations was 613, which is symbolically sig-
nificant, Mortman points out given the tra-
ditional number of Mitzvot. Conservative 
Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, a former Navy chap-
lain and line officer during the Vietnam War, 
holds the record with 16 offered prayers. The 
C–SPAN Video Library allows access to 
House prayers since 1979, and to Senate pray-
ers beginning in 1986. 
The 
book’s 
invaluable

of 
Names highlights 347 rabbis offering 
Congressional prayers. Rabbi Dr. Gary

HONORING J.D. GROM’S SERVICE 
TO THE NEW DEMOCRAT COALI-
TION 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to speak on behalf of J.D. Grom, an excep-
tional staffer and someone I’m proud to have 
called a colleague and partner. 
J.D. left Capitol Hill as the longest-serving 
Executive Director of the New Democrat Coali-
tion, and I consider myself lucky that he held 
the role during my Chairmanship of the Coali-
tion. 
We talk a lot in the NewDems about ‘‘the fu-
ture of work’’ and the fundamentally changing 
nature of our economy. Our Nation—and our 
world—have seen massive, disruptive eco-
nomic change. I’ve even seen it personally. 
My first job was working at Westside Video in 
Port Angeles, Washington. As J.D. has heard 
me say countless times, it kind of bums me 
out that the words ‘‘Be Kind, Please Rewind’’ 
mean nothing to my two kids. They live in this 
extraordinary world of seemingly unlimited 
streaming video and on-demand content. 
That’s good for them but was really disruptive 
if you worked at a video store. There are 
countless other examples. The reality is that 
today’s kids are growing up in an economy 
that is globalized, interconnected and rapidly 
changing. That can lead to growth and pros-
perity, but too often leaves a swath of workers 
and even whole communities struggling to 
compete. 
To J.D.’s credit, under his leadership, the 
NewDems kept these issues front and center. 
We worked closely together on issues like 
workforce development and lifelong learning 
accounts, portable benefits and placebased 
economic development. 
J.D. never took his eye off the economic 
ball, and we’re better for it as a Coalition. 
More than that, J.D. was a kind leader and a 
strong mentor to his staff. He’s someone I 
could always look to as well for sound judg-
ment and clear-eyed, strategic advice. 
This Coalition has never been stronger, 
thanks in no small part to the service of J.D. 
Grom. I wish him luck in his new role. To 
J.D.—as well as to his wife, Stacy, and his 
two kids, Emma and Jack, from whom we bor-
rowed J.D. on many late nights and week-
ends—I offer my congratulations, my best 
wishes, and my sincere thanks for years of 
service. 
The Force is strong with this one. We’re ex-
pecting big things from J.D. ahead.

HOMETOWN HERO—RORY 
BABINEAUX 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, it is an 
honor to include in the RECORD, the heart-
warming story of Officer Rory Babineaux. A 
16-year veteran of the Farmers Branch Police 
Department, Officer Baineaux was dispatched 
to a welfare concern call from the neighbor of 
an eighty-year-old resident concerned about 
the lady’s health and safety. 
When Officer Babineaux arrived on the 
scene to find although she was in good health, 
her air conditioner and plumbing were not 
working. Instead of passing the case off to 
others, he took it upon himself to contact local 
businesses like Right Choice Heating and Air 
and Metro North Plumbing, who found it in 
their hearts to waive all costs. 
This story not only speaks volumes for the 
type of community Farmers Branch is, but 
more 
importantly 
the 
dedication 
Officer 
Babineaux has put into the people he has 
served over the last 16 years. I thank Officer 
Babineaux, his actions inspire me to serve 
TX–24 as he has.

WAR FEMALE VETERANS OF IL-
LINOIS 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the World War II, Korean War, and Viet-
nam War Veterans who traveled to Wash-
ington, D.C. on October 6, 2021 with HerStory 
Honor Flight, a program that provides women 
World War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War 
veterans the opportunity to visit their memo-
rials on The National Mall in Washington, D.C. 
These memorials were built to honor their 
courage and service to their country. 
The American Veteran is one of our great-
est treasures. The Soldiers, Airwomen, Sail-
ors, Marines, and Coast Guardswomen who 
traveled here on October 6th answered our 
nation’s call to service during one of its great-
est times of need. From the European Cam-
paign to the Pacific Asian Theatre to the Afri-
can Theater, these brave Americans risked life 
and limb, gave service and sacrificed much, 
all while embodying what it is to be a hero. 
We owe them more gratitude than can ever be 
expressed. 
I welcome these brave veterans to Wash-
ington and to their memorials. I am proud to 
include in the RECORD the names of these 
women for all to see, hear, and recognize, and 
I call on my colleagues to rise and join me in 
expressing gratitude.

MEDICAL MARIJUANA RESEARCH 
ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Medical Marijuana Research 
Act. This legislation would remove barriers for 
research into cannabis and facilitate access to 
an increased supply of higher quality medical 
grade cannabis for research purposes. 
The cannabis laws in this country are bro-
ken, including our laws that govern cannabis 
research. Because cannabis is a Schedule I 
substance, researchers must jump through 
hoops and comply with onerous requirements 
just to do basic research on the medical po-
tential of the plant. 
The 
Medical 
Marijuana 
Research 
Act 
amends the Controlled Substances Act to es-
tablish a new, separate registration process, 
specific for marijuana. The bill would both 
streamline the often-duplicative licensure proc-
ess for researchers seeking to conduct can-
nabis research and facilitate access to an in-
creased supply of higher quality medical grade 
cannabis for research purposes. 
The Medical Marijuana Research Act will 
ensure that research on cannabis and other 
potentially beneficial marijuana-derived sub-
stances is based on sound science and re-
duce the regulatory barriers associated with 
marijuana research. The legislation requires 
the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to li-
cense outside of the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse (NIDA) to ensure that there is an ade-
quate supply of cannabis product to study. 
The legislation also shortens timelines, re-
duces unnecessary security measures, and 
streamlines approval for researchers. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to enact this legisla-
tion and enable research into the medical im-
pacts from using cannabis so Americans have 
adequate access to potentially transformative 
medicines and treatments.

CELEBRATING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BUFFALO MED-
ICAL GROUP 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today I rise in honor of Buffalo Medical 
Group, one of the oldest and largest physi-
cian-driven group practices in New York State. 
This year it will be celebrating its 75th anniver-
sary. 
Buffalo Medical Group was founded in 1946, 
the year after World War II ended. Inspired by 
the new model of group physician practice 
they had experienced during the war, prac-
tices in that model were resumed by the orga-
nization’s visionary founders, Drs. Ramsdell 
Gurney, Murray S. Howland, Jr., George F. 
Koepf, and Frank Meyers. 
The organization has flourished and now 
records more than 850,000 outpatient visits 
annually throughout its locations. Built from a 
75-year-old desire to provide the best possible 
health care, Buffalo Medical Group continues 
to provide innovative patient care today. 
Buffalo Medical Group employs not only 
more than 200 primary care, specialist, sub-
specialist physicians and advanced practi-
tioners but also over 800 other health care 
professionals. The organization serves the 
people of Western New York from a number 
of locations, including four main locations and 
seven office satellites. 
Buffalo Medical Group operates in a number 
of medical spheres, including but not limited to 
family medicine, cancer care, and vascular 
surgery. The organization also provides a 
number of support services for the people of 
Western New York, such as physical therapy, 
radiation services, and pharmacy services. 
The organization ensures that the people of 
Western New York have access to a plethora 
of medical resources. 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to honor 
Buffalo Medical Group, an organization that 
has operated in and for Western New York for 
75 years. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing this milestone.

HONORING JAMES P. BURIAK 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Naval Air Crewman 1st Class James 
‘‘Jimmy’’ P. Buriak, who died on August 31, 
2021, at the age of 31. 
Mr. Buriak, of Salem, Virginia, was one of 
the five sailors that lost their lives when an 
MH–60S helicopter embarked aboard the air-
craft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, crashed 
into the sea off the coast of southern Cali-
fornia. At the time of the crash, the helicopter 
was conducting what the Navy described as 
‘‘routine flight operations.’’ 
Mr. Buriak was born on May 9, 1990, to Jim 
and Carol Buriak in Salem. He graduated from 
Salem High School in 2008 and from Roanoke 
College in 2012. He joined the Navy in 2017 
and served as a rescue swimmer assigned to 
Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Eight. He 
deployed aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt 
for two consecutive tours before departing for 
the USS Abraham Lincoln. 
Last year, Mr. Buriak was honored for res-
cuing a man caught in a rip current off Guam’s 
Gun Beach. Though coral reefs surround the 
island, and the gentleman was weak from ex-
haustion, Mr. Buriak was still able to pull him 
from the current and bring him safely to shore. 
He was off duty at the time of the rescue and 
earned the Navy Commendation Medal for his 
selflessness and bravery. 
Mr. Buriak’s thoughtful character far exceed-
ed the parameters of his job. He always went 
out of his way to help those in need and go 
the extra mile that others weren’t willing to do. 
He was a charismatic and caring man. He val-
ued his friends and time spent with his wife 
and son. He was esteemed as a hero. I offer 
my gratitude for his work and sacrifice for our 
great country. His selfless service will not be 
forgotten. 
His wife, Megan, is starting the AWS1 
James Buriak Foundation to continue honoring 
his legacy. The foundation will seek to im-
prove financial shortcomings for Gold Star 
families with small children. 
Mr. Buriak is survived by his wife, Megan, 
and young son, Caulder, as well as his par-
ents, Jim and Carol Buriak, his sister, Laura, 
and brother-in-law, Erik Zickefoose. I offer 
them my condolences on their loss.

HONORING CALDWELL DURHAM 
HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I wish to 
dedicate some time today to commemorate 
the 100th birthday of Caldwell Durham. Born 
in Raymond, Mississippi, more than two dec-
ades before Brown v. Board of Education, 
there was no guarantee that Caldwell Durham 
(Electrical Engineer Class of 1951 at IIT) or 
his brothers and sisters would have access to 
an education. If it were not for the courage 
and idealism of his parents, Chaney and Cur-
tis Durham, Caldwell might have had a very 
different life. 
At 100, he has worked tenaciously while en-
joying a successful, barrier-breaking career as 
an aerospace engineer. He married the love of 
his life, Burnette Short Durham, and together 
they raised three children. He has four grand-
children, six great-grandchildren, and a host of 
nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grand-
nephews, cousins and in-laws. He stays in

touch with associates, including fellow Illinois 
Institute of Technology alumni Michael Hill (CS 
’82) and Perri Irmer (ARCH ’81), colleagues, 
and friends, who help him stay connected to 
his passions on a global scale. 
What’s his secret? Caldwell chuckles at the 
thought of trying to distill a century of living 
into a few pithy words of advice. ‘‘Are you 
sure you want the whole story?’’ he asks. 
The story begins when Caldwell was born 
on September 12, 1921 in Raymond, Mis-
sissippi, the seventh of eight children. As with 
all parents, Caldwell’s wanted to give their 
children the best possible start in life. His 
mother, Chaney Durham, was determined to 
ensure her children had the opportunity to ob-
tain an education. 
So, Curtis and Chaney Durham bought a 
house 750 miles away and in 1923, they 
moved their family to Chicago’s Bronzeville 
neighborhood, about two miles away from Ar-
mour Institute, the institute that would be re-
born as Illinois Institute of Technology in 1940. 
There, the Durham children did exactly what 
their mother hoped they would. They went to 
school. Caldwell graduated from DuSable High 
School in 1939 and from Woodrow Wilson 
Junior College in the spring of 1941. That De-
cember, the United States entered World War 
II. 
Caldwell knew that if he was drafted, he’d 
have little control over where or how he was 
deployed. He heard about a U.S. Army Air 
Force airborne training program which would 
train volunteers to work on aviation elec-
tronics. Durham volunteered and was accept-
ed to the training program, assigned to a seg-
regated unit of Black soldiers. Caldwell ex-
celled and his training laid the foundation for 
the rest of his career. 
After the war, Caldwell used his engineering 
training to get a job working for Western Elec-
tric, as a ‘‘wireman,’’ building and installing 
hardware for telephone stations. He was the 
only Black wireman working for Western Elec-
tric, establishing a pattern that he would re-
peat throughout his career. 
In the late 1940s, one of Caldwell’s col-
leagues mentioned that he was thinking about 
quitting his job at Western Electric to go back 
to school. Caldwell thought that with his aca-
demic and professional background and the fi-
nancial support of the GI Bill, he might be able 
to do the same. In 1949, he took a class at 
the university only a couple of miles from his 
family’s home—Illinois Institute of Technology. 
There, Caldwell engaged his remarkable ca-
pacity as an engineer and excelled. An IIT 
professor encouraged Caldwell to apply to at-
tend IIT as a full-time student, so he did. A 
few months later, he was admitted to Illinois 
Tech, where he earned a bachelor of science 
in electrical engineering and again, he ex-
celled. 
As graduation approached in 1951, Caldwell 
found little success finding a job in the Mid-
west, as few firms at the time had an interest 
in hiring a Black engineer. One of his profes-
sors at IIT suggested he look for a job on the 
west coast, so Caldwell applied for a job at 
Lockheed in California. 
In June 1951, Caldwell Durham moved 
across the country in pursuit of greater oppor-
tunity, this time with his own family. 
The Durhams settled in L.A. and Caldwell 
quickly earned the respect of his colleagues. 
Caldwell spent the next ten years working for 
Lockheed, beginning his aerospace career in 
earnest, designing and testing airplane instru-
mentation for the U–2 Spy Plane, first-genera-
tion jet aircrafts like the F–94C Starfire Inter-
ceptor, and the iconic L–1049 Super Con-
stellation. 
In 1961, Caldwell attended a conference 
where he ran into Okomoto, one of his former 
Lockheed colleagues, who had since gone to 
work for Space Technology Laboratories 
(STL). Okomoto persuaded his manager to 
interview Caldwell for a job in his office. 
Caldwell spent the rest of his career at STL, 
which later came to be known as TRW. There, 
he worked in the Ballistic Missile Flight test In-
strumentation section, participating in the 
specification and development of instrumenta-
tion systems for several ballistic missiles. Over 
a period of 28 years he truly became a rocket 
scientist. In 1978, he became head of the In-
strumentation Section. He was the only black 
section manager in TRW’s Missile Program 
Office. In 1989, he retired with honors and 
commendations. 
Success like Caldwell’s isn’t a foregone con-
clusion for anyone. But his parents likely 
wouldn’t be surprised. Chaney Durham knew 
that all of her children had potential and she 
did everything she could to give them the 
chance to express it. She knew that the best 
way to give her children this gift was through 
access to education. 
Because of his education, Caldwell was 
able to compete for opportunities that others 
like him had rarely been allowed to pursue be-
fore. And because of his talent and determina-
tion, he enjoyed a successful career. He and 
Burnette also committed themselves to pass-
ing on the lesson of the power of an education 
to their own children. Today, all three of 
Caldwell’s children achieved post-graduate de-
grees, and he counts lawyers, doctors and a 
news anchor among his children, grand-
children and great-grandchildren. 
This legacy of excellence began almost one 
hundred years ago, all because one family 
made the decision to prioritize access to edu-
cation over their own comfort. Because of that, 
the descendants of Chaney and Curtis Dur-
ham, now five generations strong, have what 
Chaney always dreamed of: a chance at a 
better life through the power of education. 
Caldwell’s 100th birthday was September 
12, 2021. He likes to say he’s lived a charmed 
life. So, what is his secret? ‘‘You know, I don’t 
know,’’ he says with a laugh, ‘‘I think exercise 
is part of the equation.’’

COMMEMORATING SANTA CLARA 
CITY LIBRARIAN PATTY WONG 
HON. RO KHANNA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to congratulate my constituent, Patty Wong, 
on becoming the first Asian American librarian 
to serve as the President of the American Li-
brary Association—an organization dedicated 
to improving learning opportunities and infor-
mation across the country. 
I am grateful for Ms. Wong’s service in my 
district as the City Librarian for the Santa 
Clara Public Library. She has dedicated her 
37-year career to improving our communities 
by serving as an award-winning librarian in in-
stitutions throughout California, and also as a 
part-time faculty member educating hundreds 
of undergraduates at San Jose State Univer-
sity. 
From serving as a school librarian, chil-
dren’s librarian, and a special librarian in 
places including Stockton-San Joaquin County 
Public Library, Oakland Public Library and 
Berkeley Public Library, she has used every 
opportunity she could find to pour her heart 
and soul into community service. Her work on 
equity and diversity, youth development, fund-
raising, and creating collaborations between li-
braries and community agencies are inspiring 
to us all. 
In each of her roles, Ms. Wong has stood 
out as a leader who is dedicated to making 
the world a better place. When the pandemic 
struck, Ms. Wong spearheaded efforts to sup-
port weekly food distribution programs, hosted 
COVID–19 testing at libraries, and partnered 
with Stanford Blood Mobile to collect blood do-
nations. Our community owes her a debt of 
gratitude for this selfless work. 
Ms. Wong is exceptional in her history of 
working in libraries and her passion for com-
munity service. I am delighted to see her ex-
traordinary talents in this new role recognized 
as the new President of the American Library 
Association. I wish her the best of luck on this 
exciting new endeavor.

HONORING BARB FULLER AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in honoring Barb Fuller of Corning, Iowa, as 
Iowan of the Week. 
This week we recognize National 4–H 
Week. As a former 4–H’er myself, I have the 
utmost respect and gratitude for the individ-
uals who devote their time and expertise to 
helping kids around our country grow and real-
ize their own potential. In Iowa, 4–H has a 
deeply rooted commitment to the growth and 
development of kids across our great State. 
For decades, Barb Fuller has dedicated her 
time and passions to the Adams County 4–H. 
Barb has been involved with 4–H for prac-
tically her entire life. She participated in the or-
ganization when she was a kid with the Colfax 
Cloverettes of Boone County, and the organi-
zation’s impact on her inspired her to take on 
more expansive roles within 4–H, especially 
after her daughter started participating in the 
organization. Barb became a leader in the 
Adams County 4–H for roughly 15 years after 
her daughter joined, leading her daughter’s 4– 
H group, the Jasper Specialists. 
Barb has impacted many of the 4–H’ers dur-
ing her time with the organization, always 
making sure anyone who wanted to participate 
was able to have the opportunity to do so. 
Barb has been dedicated to helping kids in her 
community grow, and she thoroughly enjoys 
having the opportunity to guide kids through 
different projects and tasks. What has im-
pacted Barb the most throughout her time with 
4–H has always been the ability to watch kids 
learn, grow, and gain more self-confidence 
through the projects and activities they’re able

to get involved with. One of the activities that 
Barb coordinated was the Adams County 4–H 
Shooting Sports, where she acted as a rifle in-
structor with her husband, Dave. The couple 
taught those involved in the program how to 
handle firearms safely and securely, and they 
watched 4–H’ers compete at different events 
at various levels. 
Recently, Barb was inducted into the Adams 
County 4–H Hall of Fame for her decades of 
service with the organization. Barb’s passion 
for 4–H, along with her years of instruction, 
has left a mark on generations of 4–H’ers, and 
it reminds me of the wonderful memories I 
have of interacting with my leaders and in-
structors when I was a 4–H’er. Barb’s service 
to her community is commendable, and it’s 
why I am honored to name Barb Fuller as our 
Iowan of the Week.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
DEPUTY RUSSELL F. ROARK 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the service of Deputy Russell F. 
Roark, a beloved community leader and 
former Police Chief for the City of York. 
Deputy Roark has dedicated over fifty years 
to protecting our community. He began his ca-
reer in public service as a city fireman in 
1962. The following year, he started working 
as a police officer. By April of 1983, he be-
came the Police Chief for the Union Public 
Safety Department. Throughout his twenty 
years of unparalleled leadership and service 
as Police Chief, Roark trained, mentored, and 
encouraged countless individuals who have 
entered the law enforcement profession. Other 
officers described his advice as ‘‘priceless.’’ In 
2003, Russell retired as Police Chief. Instead 
of relaxing and enjoying retirement, Russell 
continued to serve his community and imme-
diately went to work for the Union County 
Sheriffs Office as a process server. 
Described by his colleagues as dependable, 
hard-working, and compassionate, Deputy 
Roark always gives more than 100 percent to 
his job. As explained by a dear friend, ‘‘vaca-
tion and sick leave are not in his vocabulary.’’ 
Even on his days off, Deputy Roark would 
show up at work to paint the patrol office and 
spend holidays delivering gifts to individuals in 
nursing homes. 
He has exceeded expectations in service to 
our state, highlighted by his receipt of numer-
ous awards and accolades. For example, Dep-
uty Roark has been honored with the Union 
County Cornerstone Award and was named 
the 2009 Union County Sheriff Office Deputy 
of the Year. He has earned the respect of law 
enforcement and citizens all over the state. 
Most everyone in Union County still fondly re-
fers to him as ‘‘Chief’ because of his decades 
of selfless service to the community. 
The career of Deputy Roark is a testament 
to all the good our men and women in blue do 
for our communities. A true servant-leader, he 
has created a legacy of progress and success. 
On behalf of the 5th District of South Carolina, 
I thank Deputy Roark for his continued service 
and wish him all the best in his future endeav-
ors. Union County has truly been blessed to 
have him as a community guardian throughout 
the last half century.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
JERRY NALIPINSKI 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, it is with 
a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life 
of Mr. Jerry Nalipinski who died on October 
14, 2021 at the age of 91. Jerry was a deco-
rated veteran of the Korean War and a long- 
time leader and advocate for Minnesota vet-
erans and residents of the East Metro Twin 
Cities region where he lived. 
I first met Jerry when I served on the City 
Council of North Saint Paul and as a member 
of the VFW Post 1350 Auxiliary in the late 
1980s. He immediately impressed me as a go- 
to leader and doer on behalf of veterans and 
the broader community. His passing is a loss 
that is felt deeply throughout the Minnesota 
veteran community. 
After graduating from Johnson High School 
in Saint Paul, Jerry served with the 31st Regi-
ment, Seventh Division, U.S. Army in Korea 
as a communication officer, arriving in Inchon 
Harbor on a troop ship. He served with the 
American-led, United Nations forces from Can-
ada, Turkey and the other 20 coalition mem-
bers. Commanders ordered Jerry’s rifle com-
pany to the front lines shortly after arriving in 
theater, and he sustained injuries during the 
battle of Pork Chop Hill for which he was 
awarded a Purple Heart. He was awarded a 
second Purple Heart and a Bronze Star during 
his subsequent service in Korea. 
Upon his return to Minnesota, Jerry utilized 
the GI Bill to continue his academic studies. 
He went to work for Winzen Research, Inc., 
an aerospace pioneer that created high-alti-
tude balloons in the 1950s and 1960s that 
were used by the United States Navy in its 
Projects Helios, Skyhook, and Strato-Lab, that 
set the altitude record for manned balloon 
flights. He later worked at Northwestern Bell 
for many years before retiring. 
Jerry made a life-long commitment to serv-
ing veterans and others. He served as chair of 
the Minnesota Korean War Veterans Chapter 
1 and led creation and completion of the Min-
nesota Korean War Memorial. Located on the 
grounds of the State Capitol, the memorial 
pays tribute to the 738 Minnesotans who lost 
their lives and honors all 94,646 from our state 
who served in the war. 
Service defined Jerry’s life, as well as that 
of his beloved late wife Marilyn, who worked 
tirelessly along his side until her death in 
2013. A member of the Arthur O. Haukland 
VFW Post 1350 in North Saint Paul, Min-
nesota, Jerry went above and beyond to serve 
veterans and their families, working to connect 
veterans of all eras and to serve the broader 
community. 
He served in multiple leadership roles, in-
cluding chair of the scholarship committee and 
as chaplain. Jerry led a recent Post effort to 
ensure that all veterans’ graves at Saint 
Mary’s Cemetery were located and identified. 
Each Memorial Day he organized the volun-
teers that marked each grave with a flag or 
marker. 
Additionally, he was chair of the Ramsey 
United Veterans Council and vice president of 
the Military Order of the Purple Heart Chapter 
5. His efforts included ensuring each family of 
a deceased veteran received an American flag 
in a presentation case crafted by residents of 
the Hastings Veterans Home. Often, he took 
time to deliver each of these flags personally. 
Few people who are as selfless as Jerry 
was, and through his commitment to service, 
vision and stewardship, our state and our 
community is much better off. It was a privi-
lege to work with Jerry, and especially to call 
him a friend. My sincere condolences are with 
his beloved family, his fellow veterans and 
many friends. Madam Speaker, please join me 
in tribute to Jerry Nalipinski for his remarkable 
life of service to our Nation and our commu-
nity.

REMEMBERING DWIGHT BOYD 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and remember 
Dwight Boyd, a son of Louisiana, who 
transitioned to his eternal heavenly rest late 
night on Saturday, October 16, 2021. 
He was at peace in his final moments be-
side his loving families. 
He was 65 years old. 
As the oldest of six, Dwight’s family was al-
ways at the center of his world. 
His brother Glynn Boyd, one of my dearest 
friends, looked up to his older brother and re-
counted many stories from his life. 
He shared how Dwight was the first to get 
a part-time job at Winn-Dixie, and that even as 
a young man, Dwight always made sure to 
give all his siblings gifts during the holidays. 
Friends remember him graciously blessing 
them through his angelic voice when singing 
at church, in weddings, or at the 50-yard line 
during a high school football game. 
Dwight, known by childhood friends as earn-
ing the title of Mr. Higgins High School, shined 
a light on everyone he encountered. 
He loved the New Orleans Saints, cele-
brating Christmas with family, music, and poli-
tics. 
He made lifelong friends that described him 
as being the pillar of the community. 
My thoughts are with Dwight’s loving family, 
friends, and neighbors as they reel with this 
loss. 
Rest easy, and may God bless his memory.

was created to support the involvement and 
achievements of African Americans in Plano. 
For four decades, the multi-ethnic and multi- 
cultural Plano Community Forum has provided 
a voice for the people of Plano and its mem-
bers have become known as valued and re-
spected leaders. The heart of the organization 
is community involvement which has created 
opportunities for people to connect with local 
food pantries and programs that assist with 
transitional living and homeless youth. 
In recognition of scholarship recipients and 
to honor the service of local educators, busi-
ness owners, and community leaders, the 
Forum hosts an Annual Gala and Awards Pro-
gram. The proceeds from the event allow the 
organization to continue providing scholarships 
and other opportunities to support future gen-
erations. Since 1983, the non-profit organiza-
tion has awarded more than $300,000 in 
scholarships. 
Further, through expression contests, boot-
camps, and the sponsorship of events such as 
the Annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebra-
tion Weekend, the Plano Community Forum 
has supported cultural enrichment for the com-
munity. 
Now as we recognize the Plano Community 
Forum on their milestone anniversary, I ask 
my colleagues in the House of Representa-
tives to join me in honoring their selfless acts 
of service and wish them great success in all 
their future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF CLARA BELLE 
HUNTER DOUTLY 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the outstanding contributions of Ms. 
Clara Doutly, a resident of Michigan’s 13th 
Congressional District and one of our coun-
try’s ‘‘Rosie the Riveters,’’ as she celebrates 
her one hundredth birthday. 
Ms. Doutly was raised in Detroit, as the 
youngest of six siblings and attended Cass 
Technical High School. At nineteen years old, 
she began working at Briggs Manufacturing, 
where she helped produced parts and riveting 
components for B–24 and B–29 bombers for 
World War II. Ms. Doutly was one of among 
300,000 other women who worked as riveters, 
assembling warplanes across Michigan during 
the 1940s. Clara Doutly, Detroit’s own ‘‘Rosie 
the Riveter,’’ contributed to our country to vic-
tory and became an icon of women’s em-
powerment and strength. 
We owe our gratitude to Clara Doutly and 
the countless other Michigan women who 
stepped up to serve as the critical workforce 
and labor our country needed. Even now, Ms. 
Doutly continues to show up for her commu-
nity and others through her many years of 
service work at the St. Patrick’s Senior Center 
in the 13th Congressional District. Ms. Clara 
Doutly is a true example of Detroit’s strength, 
resiliency, and power of its people. We recog-
nize Ms. Doutly and all of our ‘‘Rosie the Riv-
eters’’ across our state and country for break-
ing down barriers to women in the workforce 
and for their contributions to our history. 
Please join me in wishing Detroit’s Rosie

REMBERING MP SIR DAVID AMESS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to express my condo-
lences to the family of MP Sir David Amess. 
As a member of Parliament, Sir Amess dedi-
cated himself to his constituents and their con-
cerns, often holding meetings with them on 
Fridays and was popular among his col-
leagues. 
People who knew him described him as 
very approachable, who had a passion for ani-
mal welfare and pro-life issues. In the House 
of Commons, Amess was a loyal supporter 
first of his heroine, Margaret Thatcher, then 
successive leaders after her except where 
Brexit came into play. 
Our office is especially appreciative of his 
service as Chief of Staff Jonathan Day worked 
with Sir Amess in London. 
Much of his career was spent on commit-
tees and on campaigns to improve the health 
treatment for people with arthritis, asthma, and 
other conditions. Over the last three years he 
supported 
improved 
treatment 
for 
endo-
metriosis, a cause he took up after meeting a 
constituent, and he recently supported a plan 
to erect a memorial to Vera Lynn on the white 
cliffs of Dover. He was knighted in 2015. 
He is survived by his wife, Julia Arnold, and 
five children.

CELEBRATING 
TENTH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF REV. DR. MARTIN LU-
THER KING, JR. MEMORIAL 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to mark the 10th anniversary of the dedication 
of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memo-
rial on the Tidal Basin, between the Jefferson 
and Lincoln Memorials. 
The location of this Memorial, the only me-
morial on the Mall dedicated to a person not 
an office holder or employed by the United 
States, is especially fitting, situated as it is be-
tween the author of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, which contained the audacious 
boast that ‘‘we hold these truths to be self-evi-
dent, that all men are created equal and born 
with certain inalienable rights,’’ and the great-
est of all American presidents, the Great 
Emancipator Abraham Lincoln, who under-
stood that this nation could not survive ‘‘half 
slave and half free’’ and preserved the Union 
through the great contest, testing whether this 
nation, or any nation, can long endure.’’ 
Dr. Martin Luther King was a dreamer but 
he was not just an idle daydreamer; he had an 
active faith that led him to share his vision of 
the beloved community where equal justice 
and institutions were facts of life. 
When Jefferson wrote he Declaration of 
Independence in 1776, declaring ‘‘that all Men 
are Created Equal,’’ it was equally true that at 
that time and for centuries to come, African- 
Americans were historically, culturally, and le-
gally excluded from inclusion in that declara-
tion. 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King’s ‘‘I Have 
a Dream’’ Speech, delivered 50 years ago, on 
August 28, 1963, was a clarion call to each 
citizen of this great nation that we still hear 
today. 
The request was simply and eloquently con-
veyed—he asked America to allow of its citi-
zens to live out the words written in its Dec-
laration of Independence and to have a place 
in this nation’s Bill of Rights. 
The 1960s were a time of great crisis, con-
flict, and promise. 
The dreams of the people of this country 
were filled with troubling images that arose 
like lava from the nightmares of violence and 
the crises they had to face, both domestically 
and internationally. 
It was the decade of the Cuban Missile Cri-
sis, the Vietnam War, and the assassinations 
of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mal-
colm X, Presidential Candidate Robert Ken-
nedy, and the man in whose honor the Rev. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial is dedi-
cated. 
Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream helped us 
turn the corner on civil rights. 
It started with a peaceful march for suffrage 
that started in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 
1965—a march that ended with violence at the 
hands of law enforcement officers as the 
marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
But the dream did not die there. 
Dr. King led the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 
often with Rosa Parks, a boycott that lasted 
for 381 days, and ended when the United 
States Supreme Court outlawed as unconstitu-
tional racial segregation on all public transpor-
tation. 
Dr. King used several nonviolent tactics to 
protest against Jim Crow Laws in the South 
and he organized and led demonstrations for 
desegregation, labor and voting rights. 
When the life of Dr. Martin Luther King was 
stolen from us, he was a very young 39 years 
old. 
People remember that Dr. King died in 
Memphis, but few can remember why he was 
there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1130 
October 21, 2021 
On that fateful day in 1968 Dr. King came 
to Memphis to support a strike by the city’s 
sanitation workers. 
The garbage men there had recently formed 
a chapter of the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees to demand 
better wages and working conditions. 
But the city refused to recognize their union, 
and when the 1,300 employees walked off 
their jobs the police broke up the rally with 
mace and billy clubs. 
It was then that union leaders invited Dr. 
King to Memphis. 
Despite the danger he might face entering 
such a volatile situation, it was an invitation he 
could not refuse. 
Not because he longed for danger, but be-
cause the labor movement was intertwined 
with the civil rights movement for which he 
had given up so many years of his life. 
The death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., will never overshadow his life; that is 
his legacy as a dreamer and a man of action. 
It is a legacy of hope, tempered with peace; 
it is a legacy not quite yet fulfilled. 
I hope that Dr. King’s vision of equality 
under the law is never lost to us, who in the 
present, toil in times of unevenness in our 
equality. 
For 
without 
that 
vision—without 
that 
dream—we can never continue to improve on 
the human condition. 
For those who have already forgotten, or 
whose vision is already clouded with the fog of 
complacency, I would like to recite the immor-
tal words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr.: 
‘‘I have a dream that one day on the red 
hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and 
the sons of former shareholders will be able 
to sit down together at the table of brother-
hood. 
I have a dream that one day even the State 
of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the 
heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of 
oppression, will be transformed into an oasis 
of freedom and justice. 
I have a dream that my four little children 
will one day live in a nation where they will 
not be judged by the color of their skin, but 
for the content of their character. 
I have a dream today. 
I have a dream that one day down in Ala-
bama with its vicious racists, with its Gov-
ernor having his lips dripping with words of 
interposition 
and 
nullification—one 
day 
right there in Alabama, little black boys and 
black girls will be able to join hands with lit-
tle white boys and white girls as sisters and 
brothers. 
I have a dream today. 
I have a dream that one day every valley 
shall be exalted, every hill and mountain 
shall be made low, the rough place will be 
made plain and the crooked places will be 
made straight, and the glory of the Lord 
shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it to-
gether.’’ 
Dr. King’s dream did not stop at racial 
equality, his ultimate dream was one of human 
equality and dignity. 
There is no doubt that Dr. King supported 
freedom and justice for every individual in 
America and he was in midst of planning the 
1968 Poor People’s Campaign for Jobs and 
Justice when he was struck down by the dark 
deed of an assassin on April 4, 1968. 
Therefore, it is for us, the living, to continue 
that fight today and forever, in the great spirit 
that inspired the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. 
In his 1837 Lyceum Address titled ‘‘The Per-
petuation of Our Political Institutions,’’ Abra-
ham Lincoln warned that mobs or people who 
disrespected U.S. laws and courts would al-
ways pose the most dangerous threat to the 
perpetuation of United States: 
‘‘All the armies of Europe and Asia . . . 
could not by force take a drink from the 
Ohio River or make a track on the Blue 
Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. No, if 
destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be 
its author and finisher.’’ 
But Lincoln advised us of the best defense 
against domestic threats and attacks on our 
democracy: public reverence for the Constitu-
tion and rule of law as ‘‘the political religion of 
our nation.’’ 
Madam Speaker, democracy in America is 
not an act, it is an activity; it is never finished 
or complete but always in the process of mak-
ing our union more perfect; and the nation will 
always be confronted with challenge of con-
firming the proposition that this nation, or any 
nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to 
the proposition that all are created equal can 
long endure. 
Since the assassination of President Lin-
coln, who extended malice toward but charity 
for all, no one understood this better than the 
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
That is why he is one of the greatest Ameri-
cans to have graced our Nation. 
That is why he is so worthy of the national 
honor of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Memorial.
