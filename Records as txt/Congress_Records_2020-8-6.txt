fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, our shield, we rejoice in the 
gift of Your salvation. 
Look with favor upon our Senators

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
TILLIS). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MESKWAKI POWWOW 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
want to speak about a Native Amer-
ican tradition in the State of Iowa. It 
is about the Meskwaki Nation—the 
only federally recognized Tribe in 
Iowa. 
This year, many important annual 
community events have been canceled 
due to the COVID–19 pandemic. Each 
year, the Meskwaki Powwow serves as 
an opportunity to bring the Meskwaki 
Tribe together with fellow Iowans to 
share, learn, and honor the Meskwakis’ 
unique contributions to our State. This 
gathering is important to preserving 
the Meskwakis’ heritage and sharing it 
with the next generation. 
In light of the cancellation, the 
Meskwakis are posting a number of 
educational 
resources 
on 
their 
Facebook page, at Meskwaki Nation, 
to honor the Meskwaki Annual Pow-
wow week. I encourage Iowans to visit 
and learn. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it 
has been 1 week since Senate Demo-
crats forced the additional Federal 
benefit for jobless Americans to expire. 
Senate Republicans tried everything 
to prevent the lapse. That Monday, we 
rolled out a comprehensive proposal for 
another rescue package that would 
have kept extra Federal benefits flow-
ing. The Democrats refused to act, so 
we tried to force the issue. 
One of our Senators requested unani-
mous consent to continue these bene-
fits through the end of the year at a 
still historically generous level. This 
plan would have also corrected the bi-
zarre choice facing American workers 
whom the system was actually paying 
more to stay home than to resume 
working, but that wasn’t good enough 
for the Democratic leader, and he ob-
jected. 
Another Republican Senator then 
asked unanimous consent to extend 
Federal support exactly as it had been 
for 1 more week so that jobless Ameri-
cans didn’t have to bear the cost of the 
Democrats’ leisurely negotiating pace. 
Once again, the Democratic leader ob-
jected. 
Finally, Republicans forced a floor 
vote to demonstrate whether Senators 
were even willing to debate the issue, 
whether Senators would even consider 
extending these benefits, and every sin-
gle Democrat present voted no. 
The week since then has seen plenty 
of talk and plenty of stalling from the 
Democratic leaders, who have insisted 
on handling this themselves—but no 
significant movement toward progress. 
They have still kept their ranking 
members and more reasonable voices 
locked up. The Speaker and the Demo-
cratic leader continue to obstruct the 
kinds of committee-level discussions 
that delivered the CARES Act, which 
are no longer in style. Only they are al-
lowed to speak. Only they among the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5230 
August 6, 2020 
Democrats are allowed to have an opin-
ion. 
Day after day, they have stonewalled 
the President’s team. Day by day, they 
have tried to invent new euphemisms 
to create the illusion of progress. Yes-
terday’s contribution from the Speaker 
was this: There is now a light at the 
end of the tunnel, but ‘‘how long that 
tunnel is remains to be seen.’’ Well, 
there are a lot of struggling Americans 
who could tell Speaker PELOSI exactly 
how long this tunnel has been and that 
it will continue to be endless unless the 
Democrats let us provide more relief to 
the country. 
Their second week of inaction has 
brought the country to a second cliff in 
coronavirus aid. Last week, it was the 
extra Federal benefit for laid-off work-
ers. This week, it is the enormously 
popular Paycheck Protection Program 
that has kept millions more Americans 
off the unemployment rolls in the first 
place. 
The PPP was written and designed in 
March by Chairman RUBIO and Chair-
man COLLINS as Main Street America 
was hurtling toward a cliff. Their inno-
vative policy has saved small busi-
nesses on a massive scale. Hundreds of 
billions of dollars have gone out in 
emergency loans to more than 600,000 
small businesses. 
I hear constantly from Kentuckians 
whose local businesses and whose jobs 
would not have survived the last sev-
eral months without this program. 
From distilleries to medical device 
suppliers to domestic violence advo-
cates, the PPP has helped community 
institutions weather the storm and 
keep more Kentuckians on the payroll. 
This emergency program hasn’t been 
perfect, but it has been a huge, huge 
success. It has remained a success be-
cause, back in April, we finally got the 
Democrats to let us provide another 
wave of funding after a pointless delay 
and pointless brinksmanship—you may 
detect a pattern here—but now many 
of these businesses are reaching the 
ends of their ropes. Their PPP money 
is dwindling, but since the virus re-
mains with us, even where shutdown 
orders have been lifted, commerce has 
not roared all the way back. 
One survey found that one in four 
workers who were hired back and kept 
getting paid because of the PPP has 
now been warned he might be let go 
again, and you can bet that number 
will increase. 
Here is how one business owner ex-
plained the looming danger to report-
ers: ‘‘If there isn’t another round of 
stimulus, we’ll start cutting past the 
fat and to the bone, and that’s our peo-
ple, and our people are hard to re-
place.’’ 
Congress should be strengthening the 
PPP. Instead, the Democrats have put 
it in jeopardy. This Saturday, August 
8, is the official deadline for anyone 
who hasn’t yet gotten a loan to apply. 
The door closes the day after tomor-
row, and many firms that did receive 
the assistance are getting nearer to the 
bottom of the well. 
This is why the Senate Republicans’ 
blueprint for another major rescue 
package would put $190 billion into a 
second draw of the PPP for the busi-
nesses that most need help. The House 
Democrats’ $3 trillion wish list totally 
left that out. They ignored the PPP. 
We want to re-up it. 
This is just one of the many ways our 
serious proposal beats the absurd far- 
left wish list the Democrats’ own mod-
erate Members laughed out of the 
room. While they focus on unrelated 
liberal demands, like tax cuts for rich 
people in blue States, we are focused on 
serious solutions for the problems fac-
ing Americans right now. 
Yet, instead of getting serious, the 
Democratic leaders have chosen, in-
stead, to misrepresent and even lie 
about what is at stake. The Demo-
cratic leader’s repeated misstatements 
about the legal protections that the 
Senate Republicans and the White 
House 
want 
for 
schools, 
doctors, 
nurses, charities, and employers have 
earned him ‘‘three Pinocchios’’ from 
the Washington Post and a ‘‘Mostly 
False’’ rating from another fact-check-
er. Let me say that again. The Demo-
cratic leader’s repeated misstatements 
about the legal protections the Senate 
Republicans and the White House want 
for schools, doctors, nurses, charities, 
and employers have earned him ‘‘three 
Pinocchios’’ from the Washington Post 
and a ‘‘Mostly False’’ rating from an-
other fact-checker. He doesn’t even 
seem to realize that we modeled our 
medical malpractice reforms on the 
COVID-related protections that his fel-
low Democrats put in place in New 
York. 
So this is where we are—another 
week that the Speaker of the House 
and the Democratic leader have spent 
stonewalling the President’s team in 
talks and holding out for ideological 
pet projects with no relationship what-
soever to the COVID crisis. Now, as a 
result, struggling Americans are facing 
another cliff, with another important 
form of relief on its last legs. 
We face a second straight week of po-
litical theater from our Democratic 
colleagues with no result—except more 
pain for families, more uncertainty for 
workers, and more evidence to suggest 
that perhaps the Democratic leaders 
were never serious about getting some-
thing accomplished in the first place. 
All across America, small business 
owners are hurting and hoping the 
Democrats get reasonable and allow 
another major package to move for-
ward. 
Unemployed 
Americans 
need 
these endless talks to finally bear 
fruit, and so do school principals and 
working parents and senior citizens 
and nurses and doctors and university 
presidents and students of all ages. 
That is why I will not be adjourning 
the Senate for our August recess today 
as had been previously scheduled. I 
have told Republican Senators they 
will have 24-hours’ notice before a vote, 
but the Senate will be convening on 
Monday, and I will be right here in 
Washington. The House has already 
skipped town, but the Senate will not 
adjourn for August unless and until the 
Democrats demonstrate they will never 
let an agreement materialize. 
A lot of Americans’ hopes—a lot of 
American lives—are riding on the 
Democrats’ endless talk. I hope they 
are not disappointed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5231 
August 6, 2020 
PELOSI and I have been engaged in seri-
ous discussions and negotiations with 
the White House over another round of 
emergency relief for the American peo-
ple. Our motivation is simple: Ameri-
cans are crying out for relief. 
Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths 
continue to climb. The snowball of eco-
nomic impacts continue to roll down-
hill. This morning, we learned that an-
other 1.2 million Americans filed for 
unemployment—far more than at any 
time during the great recession that 
began in 2008. 
Our two parties don’t agree on many 
things. That is no secret. The Trump 
administration has bungled this crisis 
from the very beginning and even now 
is careening from one self-inflicted cri-
sis to the next. Democrats believe that 
Congress has a moral obligation to step 
into the breach to help Americans put 
food on the table and keep a roof over 
their heads, to save our economy from 
a deeper recession and longer recovery, 
and to fight this disease with all the 
resources and wherewithal a great na-
tion can bring to bear. 
After the Senate Republican major-
ity failed in spectacular fashion to put 
together a bill even its own Members 
could support, Democrats have engaged 
in arduous negotiations with the White 
House trying to impress upon them the 
gravity of the situation. We have made 
some progress this week but not 
enough. The biggest reason is that 
Trump and his aides and his party in 
Congress are not truly awake to what 
is happening in this country. 
The Trump administration and Sen-
ate Republicans have badly mauled the 
body politic, the American economy, 
and American healthcare. We Demo-
crats believe the patient needs a major 
operation, while Republicans want to 
apply a bandaid. And we will not let 
them just pass the bandaid, go home, 
and still leave America bleeding. That 
is the difference right now on so many 
issues. 
Our Republican counterparts refuse 
to acknowledge that Americans who 
have lost their jobs through no fault of 
their own might need some assistance 
with rent. The Republican leader warns 
of an epidemic of lawsuits that hasn’t 
materialized. What will materialize 
soon is an epidemic of evictions unless 
we extend the moratorium and pass 
rental assistance. Between 19 and 23 
million households—one in five rental 
households—will be at risk of eviction 
by the end of September unless we do 
something, unless our Republican col-
leagues wake up. 
Our Republican counterparts refuse 
to acknowledge that State, local, and 
Tribal governments, which the Trump 
administration abandoned in the early 
days of this crisis, might need Federal 
support 
to 
prevent 
teachers, 
fire-
fighters, busdrivers from being laid off 
and public services from being slashed 
at the worst possible time. Leader 
MCCONNELL
just states that States 
should go bankrupt. That is not accept-
able. 
Our Republican counterparts refuse 
to acknowledge that running an elec-
tion in the middle of a pandemic is 
going to be difficult; that State elec-
tion systems are going to need more re-
sources; and our post office must be 
well-staffed and prepared to manage an 
election that will see more voting by 
mail than any before. 
Yesterday, 
the 
Republican 
leader 
scoffed at the idea of extended en-
hanced unemployment benefits because 
it would mean that some Americans 
without work would be paid more than 
our essential workers. Conveniently, 
the Republican leader did not mention 
that Democrats have proposed for 
months that we give our essential 
workers additional hazard pay and that 
he and his party continue to block it. 
If our friends on the other side are fi-
nally worried about how little many of 
our essential workers are making as we 
are, I would hope they will put their 
money where their mouth is and sup-
port our proposal to give them hazard 
pay. 
When it comes to elections and edu-
cation, food assistance for hungry chil-
dren, and, mind-bogglingly, when it 
comes to healthcare, testing, tracing, 
and Medicaid, our Republican friends 
continue to pinch pennies during a na-
tional emergency. 
Again, this is the reason our negotia-
tions with the White House have been 
so difficult. The President and his aides 
and his party in Congress are not even 
awake to the crisis in our country. 
President Trump doesn’t have a plan, 
doesn’t engage in negotiations, and 
still manages to undercut the negotia-
tions at every turn. 
There is no leadership from the 
White House at a time of great crisis. 
Historians will look back and say this 
is one of the greatest crises America 
has felt, and the White House is no-
where to be found. It has never hap-
pened before. 
Way back in March, after we passed 
the CARES Act, the Senate Republican 
majority made a dangerous gamble. 
Leader MCCONNELL said he was putting 
the Senate on ‘‘pause’’ to see what 
would 
happen. 
Senate 
Republicans 
swallowed the President’s ridiculous 
fantasy that the disease would just dis-
appear. Hoping they wouldn’t have to 
do anything, the Republican majority 
put the Senate on ice for 4 long 
months—4 months. Only yesterday, 
Leader MCCONNELL admitted that his 
delay 
‘‘allowed 
us 
to 
learn 
the 
coronavirus didn’t mysteriously dis-
appear.’’ 
Look, at this late stage, after months 
of Republican delay, as the country got 
worse and worse, after Republicans in 
the Senate failed to generate a pro-
posal that even their own caucus or 
President could support, Democrats are 
now in the room—we are the ones in 
the room trying to negotiate a bill that 
will meet the country’s needs. 
While some of my friends on the 
other side of the aisle are just looking 
for an outcome, any outcome, so they 
can vote on something and go home, we 
are not going to agree to an inadequate 
bill that doesn’t address the challenges 
in our country. 
We are not going to give up. We are 
going to keep fighting until we achieve 
the caliber of legislation the American 
people, during this time of great crisis, 
need and deserve. We are going to keep 
working until we get it done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
news this morning about the actions 
taken by Facebook and Twitter in rela-
tion to statements made by President 
Trump is incredible. We now have a de-
cision by these two major sources of 
social media to draw down and to re-
move statements made by the Presi-
dent of the United States on the issue 
of 
the 
national 
health 
emergency 
which we currently face. 
They believe—and certainly, on its 
face, it is clear—that these statements 
by President Trump misrepresented 
medical fact in terms of the immunity 
of children to COVID–19 and the state 
of play in America when it comes to 
this pandemic. 
The numbers 5 and 25 tell a real 
story. America has roughly 5 percent of 
the world’s population and, sadly, 25 
percent of the COVID infections in the 
world. How could a great and strong 
nation like ours have reached this 
point where this medical crisis has 
reached a point where many parts of 
America are facing recordbreaking in-
fection levels? 
Part of it has to do with the lack of 
leadership: a President who has refused 
to acknowledge experts like Dr. Fauci 
and others, who, when they say things 
that disappoint him, are banished from 
appearing on television with him or 
making public statements in con-
tradiction of his bizarre point of view. 
We also know, as well, that the Presi-
dent has downplayed, from the start, 
the threat of this COVID–19. One of the 
reasons Facebook and Twitter removed 
his statements is that the President 
continues to diminish the severity of 
this crisis. 
We know, as well, that he has failed 
to tell us the truth and has speculated 
on medical theories that are just pure 
quackery. Who can forget the Presi-
dent’s famous press conference talking 
about ingesting disinfectants, his theo-
ries about ultraviolet lights, and this 
hydroxychloroquine fantasy that he 
continues to enjoy telling the Amer-
ican people? We know, as well, that he 
has failed to take action when it was 
needed. 
Initially, Governors, including my 
own in the State of Illinois, were des-
perate for the equipment that they

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5232 
August 6, 2020 
needed to protect healthcare workers 
and to save the lives of those who were 
infected with the coronavirus. At this 
moment in time, many people are ask-
ing me basic questions on my website. 
One of the questions from a lady this 
morning said: Why is it that the United 
Kingdom has a rapid test and we don’t 
in the United States? I wish I could an-
swer that, but I can’t. 
The fact is, if you are taking a test 
to see if you are positive for the 
coronavirus and the results aren’t 
available for 5 days or even 12 days, 
they are almost pointless. At that 
point in time, it is just a data point in 
history, not something that you could 
rely on in terms of your own conduct. 
How do the Republicans in the Sen-
ate explain the nonchalance many of 
them have displayed when it comes to 
the challenges we face? This is the 
worst national health crisis we have 
faced in 100 years. We know that people 
are dying. Over 150,000 have died al-
ready in this country, and we know 
that number is likely to grow. 
Despite that, when it comes to put-
ting money into testing, Democrats 
have called for a dramatic investment 
to make that happen, and the Repub-
licans—just $16 billion for a nation 
that needs so much more. 
When it comes to the economy, I 
can’t understand the position of the 
Republicans. They refuse to come for-
ward with their own plan to rescue our 
economy, to help unemployed families, 
and to put businesses back in business, 
and they seem to lack a sense of ur-
gency as to the situation we currently 
face. 
The American people take this situa-
tion very, very seriously. We have re-
cently done surveys and found that 
they overwhelmingly believe we still 
have major challenges ahead, and they 
start with the coronavirus. Why hasn’t 
this President used the resources of 
this government to come up with a 
quick, rapid-results test so that people 
can learn whether they are positive for 
coronavirus in a quick fashion? We 
can’t realistically expect to open the 
economy or open our schools until we 
have that available across the United 
States of America. Yet the President 
doesn’t seem to want to take on that 
responsibility. 
For those who believe that we can 
say to the unemployed ‘‘If you would 
just work a little harder, you would 
find a job,’’ they ought to face the re-
ality. The reality is we have four un-
employed workers in America for every 
job opening. The reality, as well, is 
that employers who wish to fill their 
positions are doing it at a faster pace 
than at any time. And this notion that 
if you are receiving an unemployment 
check you are going to stay home and 
not go back to work—in the last few 
months, of the people who have re-
turned to work in America, 70 percent 
of them were being paid more on unem-
ployment than they were on the jobs 
that they returned to, but they wanted 
to get back to work. They believe in 
work. They know that unemployment 
is a temporary help and that they have 
to get back on their own feet as quick-
ly as possible. Plus, there are benefits 
to working. One of them is health in-
surance, and many people returned to 
work to get back to the health insur-
ance that they particularly think is 
right for their family. 
So why would the Republicans be 
suggesting a reduction in the weekly 
benefit by some $400? They ought to sit 
down and talk to the people who are re-
ceiving these unemployment checks, as 
I did last Friday in Chicago. Let them 
tell their stories. What are they spend-
ing these unemployment checks for? 
Overwhelmingly, the basics of life: 
food, paying utility bills, rent and 
mortgage payments. 
People aren’t salting this money 
away. Almost half of the unemployed 
in America have exhausted all of their 
savings. Some of them have resorted to 
selling some piece of property they 
own, some goods or articles that might 
raise enough money to help them pay 
their bills. It is a desperate situation 
for the 30 million Americans who are 
unemployed. I don’t understand why 
the Republicans don’t engage with us 
in addressing this problem directly. 
How can we possibly explain that, in 
the negotiation over the next rescue 
package for America, we have the 
President’s Chief of Staff; the Sec-
retary of the Treasury; the Speaker of 
the House, Democrat NANCY
PELOSI; 
CHUCK SCHUMER, the Democratic leader 
in the Senate; and two empty chairs? 
Senator MCCONNELL does not partici-
pate in this negotiation, nor does Lead-
er MCCARTHY from the Republicans in 
the House. 
They should be there. That is their 
job. This notion that they can stand off 
on the sidelines and just criticize 
things that are being discussed is not 
productive. 
America 
needs 
more. 
America needs a better approach when 
it comes to this. 
Another issue that comes up every 
time I open any conference call to 
questioning from an audience is our 
Postal Service. In July, Postmaster 
General DeJoy eliminated overtime for 
postal employees even though parcel 
volumes were up almost 60 percent in 
June compared to last year. Usually, 
about 20 percent of all the work by 
mail handlers, city carriers, and postal 
drivers is done in overtime. 
In the July memo announcing these 
operational changes, the new Post-
master acknowledged that employees— 
listen to this quote—‘‘may see mail left 
behind or mail on the workroom floor 
or docks . . . which is not typical.’’ 
Postmaster General DeJoy routinely 
compares the Postal Service, a 245- 
year-old government agency that per-
forms a service, to U.S. Steel as an ex-
ample of the need to adapt to the new 
market realities. Postmaster DeJoy 
does not seem to understand that the 
Postal Service is an essential service 
provided by the government, not a lux-
ury and certainly not a routine busi-
ness. 
Americans rely on the U.S. Postal 
Service to deliver needed packages, 
medications, Social Security checks, 
and other benefits. Many small busi-
nesses would absolutely fold if they 
couldn’t use the U.S. Postal Service 
and its daily operations, and rural 
Americans especially know that many 
for-profit delivery services will not 
come to their addresses in smalltown 
America. The Postal Service will be 
there. 
We are less than 100 days from an 
election where mail-in ballots deliv-
ered by the Postal Service will be vital 
to ensuring people of all political per-
suasions that they can safely exercise 
their right to vote while following pub-
lic health experts’ recommendations to 
reduce the spread of COVID–19. 
When contacted to schedule a call 
with the Postmaster General, his of-
fice’s response was this: ‘‘Currently, he 
is not taking calls or meetings as he is 
focusing on understanding the organi-
zation.’’ Understanding the organiza-
tion? 
The Heroes Act that passed the 
House of Representatives 11 weeks ago 
included $25 billion in emergency fund-
ing to cover revenue losses over the 
next 2 years. I believe in the Postal 
Service, and I thank the employees. My 
own mail carrier in my neighborhood 
back in Springfield, Greg, works late 
hours, usually delivers our mail at 7 
p.m. He tells me he is delivering a lot 
of packages now. He said: Senator, I 
just delivered a package of duct tape to 
one of your neighbors. I want to make 
sure I deliver your mail every single 
day, as promised. 
He is a dedicated public servant. You 
can tell it in his manner and his gait 
and his attitude. He takes his job very, 
very seriously, and he does it well, as 
so many do. 
We need to support our Postal Serv-
ice. This is not something we can af-
ford to skimp on at this moment in 
American history. I hope the Repub-
licans will join us in believing that the 
Postal Service is worth an investment 
today, and I hope that we can include 
that in anything that we move forward. 
There is another provision I would 
hope to include in any rescue package, 
and it addresses an issue that we all 
feel intensely. Across America, many 
communities routinely face the harsh 
reality of too few doctors or nurses, 
dentists, or behavioral health pro-
viders. It means delayed healthcare in 
many communities, gaps in accessing 
lifesaving services, and, ultimately, 
worse health outcomes, especially in 
low-income rural and urban areas. 
Our Nation is projected to face a 
shortage of up to 120,000 doctors within 
the next 10 years and a shortfall of 
hundreds of thousands of nurses for 
each of the next several years. If you 
ask the question, you will find that 
many 
hospitals 
and 
clinics 
in 
smalltown America resort to contract 
nurses. These are nurses who are avail-
able in an emergency, but they are ex-
pensive, sometimes charging two or

three times what a nurse is usually 
paid at the same place—and that was 
before the coronavirus rampage across 
our Nation. 
This pandemic has magnified these 
shortages in our system. In my State 
of Illinois, Governor Pritzker had to 
call providers out of retirement from 
other States to deliver surge care while 
fourth-year medical students at the 
University of Illinois at Chicago were 
graduated early so that they could go 
to work. 
Over the past 6 months, America’s 
healthcare workers have faced incred-
ible strains on the frontlines in our 
fight against the coronavirus. Hun-
dreds of healthcare workers have, trag-
ically, died from COVID–19, tens of 
thousands have been infected, and 
countless more endured trauma and 
burnout from intense patient care. 
The 
crisis 
has 
also 
compounded 
alarming health disparities for Black 
and Latinx Americans, who are three 
times more likely to get sick and die 
from COVID–19 than White patients. A 
lack of minority physicians and health 
professionals of color contributes to 
this unconscionable inequity. In 2018, 
only 4 percent of incoming medical stu-
dents in Illinois were Black men. A re-
cent study found that there are fewer 
Black male medical students today 
than there were in 1978. That is 42 
years ago. 
The simple economics of American 
medical education pose a barrier to our 
health workforce needs. We take our 
most promising students, put them 
through years of rigorous education 
and training, license them after a 
backbreaking residency on one condi-
tion: They have to be prepared to as-
sume a student debt of, on average, 
more than $200,000 to be a doctor in 
America. 
The burden of paying off these loans 
steers some of our best and brightest 
minds into higher paying specialties 
and communities, leaving many areas 
with gaps and vulnerable to the chal-
lenges we are facing today. 
To address these health workforce 
challenges and medical disparities and 
to bolster surge capacity for future 
emergencies, I have partnered with 
Senator MARCO RUBIO of Florida. To-
gether, we have introduced Strength-
ening America’s Health Care Readiness 
Act, immediately restoring our pipe-
line of doctors, nurses, and other pro-
viders. How do we do it? We provide 
scholarships and loan repayment fund-
ing through the National Health Serv-
ice Corps and Nurse Corps to those who 
commit to serve in needy areas. 
In 27 States, more than 70 percent of 
inpatient hospital beds are full. One of 
the major issues with this capacity 
strain is the lack of providers to actu-
ally staff these health units. Our bill 
would help to surge tens of thousands 
of clinicians into these communities. 
To narrow disparities that I mentioned 
earlier, our legislation would empha-
size recruitment from populations his-
torically 
underrepresented 
in 
healthcare, and our bill would enhance 
our emergency preparedness by pro-
viding loan repayment for clinicians 
who serve in a reserve capacity—simi-
lar to our National Guard—who could 
be deployed from the private practice 
to serve in disaster locations. 
Representative 
SCHAKOWSKY—JAN 
SCHAKOWSKY of Chicago—is our partner 
in the House. We are pleased to have 
the support of the American Medical 
Association, the Association of Amer-
ican Medical Colleges, the National As-
sociation of Community Health Cen-
ters, and many more. 
Senator RUBIO and I are working to 
include 
this 
policy 
in 
the 
next 
coronavirus relief package. We urge 
our colleagues to support it. 
BELARUS 
Madam President, the other day, the 
Chicago Tribune ran a story with this 
moving headline: 
Her husband jailed, her kids sent away, a 
37-year-old ex-teacher is running for presi-
dent. She’s trying to beat ‘‘Europe’s last dic-
tator.’’ 
The story went on to explain the cou-
rageous 
effort 
of 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya to run for the election 
on August 9 in Belarus for President, 
where the country’s strongman, Alex-
ander 
Lukashenko, 
regularly 
runs 
sham elections and usually caps them 
off by jailing anyone who has the te-
merity, or nerve, to run against him. 
In fact, he jailed Sviatlana’s husband— 
a popular online commentator—a few 
months ago. He disqualified or jailed 
other candidates and harassed and de-
tained protesters and journalists, in-
cluding those from Radio Free Europe. 
I am not surprised by what I read in 
the Tribune. You see, 10 years ago, I 
went to Belarus, just after the equally 
appalling December 2010 Presidential 
election in which the same dictator, 
Lukashenko, jailed the opposition can-
didates. When I arrived there just after 
the election, I had a meeting I will 
never forget. It was with the family 
members of many of these jailed can-
didates. They were deeply concerned 
for the safety of their loved ones who 
had been rounded up by Lukashenko’s 
KGB—and, yes, he still calls his secret 
police the KGB. 
They spoke movingly—these mem-
bers of the family—about their admira-
tion for their loved ones who had 
risked so much just to run in an elec-
tion and lose against Lukashenko. 
They spoke of the fear of what would 
happen at the hands of Lukashenko’s 
henchmen. 
I later told their stories on the floor 
of the Senate. Shortly thereafter, the 
Senate passed a resolution that I intro-
duced with Senators McCain, Lieber-
man, and others that said that the an-
nounced result of this election in 
Belarus was neither credible nor sus-
tainable since they jailed the political 
candidates who opposed Lukashenko. 
Eventually, all of them were released, 
but it took time. 
Here we go again—witnessing the 
same brutality and deprivation for the 
most basic demographic freedoms on 
the 
European 
continent. 
Clearly, 
Lukashenko knows he cannot win a 
fair election, so he turns to the usual 
autocrats’ 
playbook—harassing 
and 
jailing opposition, rigging and discred-
iting 
the 
electoral 
process, 
and 
unleashing brutality on anyone who re-
sisted. 
I am here to say to Mr. Lukashenko, 
no one in the West is fooled. That is 
why I am pleased to have introduced a 
resolution 
with 
Senators 
Rubio, 
Cardin, and others that calls for the re-
lease of those disgracefully jailed dur-
ing the Belarus election period. It calls 
for basic international election norms 
to be adhered to, including the allow-
ing of international and local election 
observers and for the peaceful exercise 
of basic democratic rights. 
I want to thank my colleagues who 
joined me on this measure. I believe 
this matter has been passed by live 
consent. I thank my colleagues for giv-
ing me the opportunity to let them 
know about this violation of demo-
cratic values in Belarus. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
every day we can see that this public 
health crisis is also an economic crisis. 
During the shutdowns, some employers 
shuttered completely, and others were 
forced to lay off workers. Tens of mil-
lions of jobs were saved thanks to the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
and 
other CARES Act provisions, but mil-
lions of other Americans lost their jobs 
and remain unemployed. 
While job numbers have improved 
since the more dire days of March and 
April, there are still many Americans 
facing unemployment. Talks are con-
tinuing to determine how best to mod-
ify and extend a Federal supplement to 
State unemployment insurance pro-
grams, but those talks are going miser-
ably slowly. 
These State programs and the extra 
Federal aid have been important safety 
nets for folks who have lost their in-
come, but they are only a piece of what 
we can and should do and what a bill 
before the U.S. Senate lays out. It is 
called the HEALS Act, put forth by our 
leader. 
As the leader said yesterday, we 
know that these programs shouldn’t 
pay someone more to stay home than 
essential workers are making by work-
ing hard. We also know that most peo-
ple would prefer to have a reliable job 
and avoid layoff entirely. That is why 
Republicans, as part of the HEALS 
Act, have put forward several addi-
tional proposals to help already unem-
ployed Americans and prevent others

from getting laid off in the first place. 
That is why these talks ought to speed 
up, so we can get some of these other 
things in place as well as the unem-
ployment issues that we are talking 
about. 
We extend and significantly expand 
the employee retention tax credit that 
was included in the CARES Act so that 
employers can keep more people on the 
payroll instead of laying them off. It 
supports businesses that hire more 
workers as the economy continues to 
improve. 
We expand the work opportunity tax 
credit to support employers who are 
helping those currently receiving un-
employment insurance find a new, safe, 
and steady job. Bringing in new em-
ployees and expanding the workforce 
can be complicated, especially in times 
of a pandemic. Both employers and em-
ployees want to maintain safe working 
environments. It is important for em-
ployers to have the resources to keep 
their workplaces clean and their em-
ployees protected. Republicans then 
proposed a new tax credit for these ex-
penses, like additional cleaning ex-
penses, personal protective gear, and 
even office reconfigurations that keep 
employees and customers safe. 
The HEALS Act also provides for an-
other round of economic impact pay-
ments. An average family of four would 
receive $3,400 to help cover expenses. 
These payments will help any family or 
any individual who has had to deal 
with layoffs and are in addition to any 
unemployment benefits they may re-
ceive. 
These tax provisions serve as a com-
plement to the unemployment insur-
ance program that is being negotiated 
right 
now, 
with 
no 
evidence 
of 
progress. There ought to be progress. 
These programs do set up an extra 
layer of protection for workers and 
those already out of work. 
Together, these proposals provide a 
responsible approach to help employers 
reopen businesses so that employees 
can safely and effectively return to 
work to continue fueling the Nation’s 
economic recovery. 
Why can’t we get these important 
issues resolved for the American peo-
ple, particularly for the American peo-
ple who are hurting? And they are 
hurting because we were faced with a 
virus pandemic. As a result of the virus 
pandemic, the government, for the first 
time in 240 years, shut down the econ-
omy of the United States, and then im-
mediately, in the middle of March, 
after that happened, we made a point 
of passing the CARES Act to open up 
the economy, to give people confidence 
that what the government did that was 
bad for the economy and for people and 
hurting people, unemployed—that we 
were going to take a lead in getting 
them back. And we are still in this sit-
uation. We shouldn’t be debating as 
long as we are to get these issues taken 
care of. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

taining to the introduction of S. 4466

Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Ms. SMITH. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 285 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, if you are 
a person just watching politics back 
home, you probably see a common 
theme: talking. No matter the topic, 
people in DC like to talk but not much 
gets done. 
There is one topic that is especially 
guilty of this, and that is immigration. 
Democrat or Republican, conservative 
or liberal, we know our immigration 
system is broken. That is an easy 
statement to make, but nothing ever 
changes, and we need to start getting 
things done. 
In Iowa, we learned this in a very 
tragic way. On January 31, 2016, the 
same day as her college graduation, 
Sarah Root was killed by an illegal im-
migrant named Eswin Mejia. He was 
drag racing with a blood alcohol level 
more than three times the legal limit. 
Despite repeated requests by local 
law enforcement, Immigrations and 
Customs Enforcement failed to detain 
Mejia because of a nonsensical policy 
that allows ICE to use discretion when 
determining whether to detain a crimi-
nal alien charged with a violent of-
fense. He posted bond; he was released; 
and he disappeared. Still, more than 4 
years later, he remains a fugitive, de-
nying Sarah’s loved ones any sense of 
justice for closure. 
As a mother, I cannot fathom the 
grief her family and friends continue to 
feel after such a devastating loss. 
Sarah had her whole future ahead of 
her, but her opportunity to make her 
mark on the world was tragically cut 
short. Yet even in death, she touched 
the lives of others, saving six different 
individuals through organ donation. 
Sadly, what happened to Sarah is not 
an isolated incident. We have seen this 
story play out time and again in the 
more than 4 years since Sarah’s kill-
ing—innocent lives taken by criminals 
who enter the United States illegally 
through a porous border, but nothing 
ever changes. 
Although nothing can bring Sarah 
back to her family, we can ensure that 
ICE never makes the same mistake 
again. 
Today, I rise to call upon my Senate 
colleagues to end this senseless mad-
ness, to do something and stop another 
tragedy like this from happening with 
a simple and clean fix. I am asking the 
Senate to join 26 of their colleagues 
and pass my bill, S. 285, Sarah’s Law. 
Sarah’s Law is simple. It requires 
that ICE take custody of a person who 
is in the country illegally if they are 
charged with a crime that seriously in-
jures another person. It also mandates 
a better victim notification system 
that lets victims and their families 
know what happened to their loved 
ones. 
Sarah’s Law is about as common-
sense a reform as there is. It recognizes 
the simple fact that all criminals 
should be held accountable for their ac-
tions and not simply be allowed to slip 
back into the shadows. If Sarah’s Law 
is passed, people who are in this coun-
try illegally who murder another per-
son would be prioritized for deporta-
tion if released. Who could be opposed 
to this? 
Here is a bit of good news. President 
Trump implemented parts of Sarah’s 
Law through an Executive order in 
2017, including directing the Secretary 
of Homeland Security to prioritize the 
removal of violent criminals. Despite 
provisions of Sarah’s Law being put 
into place by President Trump’s order, 
it is critical that the Senate codify 
these enforcement priorities so they 
cannot be removed by future adminis-
trations. 
This may seem crazy to those watch-
ing at home, but criminal aliens 
charged with homicide were allowed to 
escape detention in previous adminis-
trations. No family should ever have to 
endure such a tragedy, especially one 
that could have been prevented. 
I recognize that the immigration de-
bate has become a political football, 
but justice for victims and their fami-
lies is not a game. This bill isn’t about 
the southern border or the wall or visa 
numbers or the larger immigration de-
bate at all. This bill is about changing 
the system for the better and ensuring 
that families have the promise of jus-
tice. I intend to fulfill that promise to 
Sarah’s loving parents, Michelle Root 
and Scott Root—the promise that I 
will do everything I can to ensure that 
not one more parent has to go through 
what the Roots have faced—the loss of 
both their daughter and the promise of 
justice. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
here to join my colleague from Iowa, 
Senator ERNST, in this effort. 
We ought to get this unanimous con-
sent request accomplished, and we 
ought to get this bill passed because it 
is unjustified that we don’t get the co-
operation that it takes to keep a per-
son who has committed a felony from 
the jurisdiction of the courts of the 
United States. 
I joined Senator ERNST in reintro-
ducing Sarah’s Law on January 31 of 
last year, and that was the third anni-
versary of Sarah Root’s death. Sarah 
was from Council Bluffs, IA, and as my

August 6, 2020 
colleague said, Sarah was tragically 
killed in Omaha, NE, on the very night 
of her graduation. An illegal alien 
struck and killed her while he was 
driving drunk. He was three times over 
the legal limit of the amount of alco-
hol you can have in your blood to be a 
safe driver. 
It is a travesty that the previous ad-
ministration refused to take Sarah’s 
killer into custody. He was not consid-
ered a priority. Can you imagine that? 
Her killer then disappeared. Obviously, 
being a smart person who is in viola-
tion of the law, he is not going to be 
seen. So he remains at large. I have 
said before that Sarah’s senseless death 
is a tragic reminder of the serious im-
provements that we need in border se-
curity and in interior immigration en-
forcement in our United States of 
America. 
It is outrageous that many innocent 
Americans have been seriously injured 
and, in some cases, killed as a result of 
the actions of criminal illegal aliens. 
It is even more outrageous that 
criminal illegal aliens, like the one 
who killed Sarah Root, are not subject 
to mandatory immigration detention. 
Sarah’s Law would amend the Immi-
gration and Nationality Act to require 
the mandatory detention of an illegal 
alien who is charged with a crime re-
sulting in the death or serious bodily 
injury of another person. 
This bill is common sense. A lot of 
times, common sense doesn’t prevail in 
Washington, DC, and the long time to 
get this very important legislation 
passed is evidence of the lack of com-
mon sense. This bill is long overdue. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of the 
bill and to support Senator ERNST’s 
unanimous consent request. I gladly 
thank her for her leadership in this 
area. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on the Ju-
diciary be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 285 and that the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; further, that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, reserving 
my right to object, this family has suf-
fered a terrible loss and has my sin-
cerest condolences. 
Too many families in my home State 
of New Mexico have lost loved ones to 
DUIs, and I have made reducing DUIs 
one of my top priorities. As State at-
torney general, I worked to increase 
penalties and get them off the roads. 
In the Senate, I am working on a bi-
partisan basis to use technology to get 
us to the place at which we can elimi-
nate drunk driving and save thousands 
of lives per year. The Presiding Officer 
also knows that we are working very 
well, in a bipartisan way, to tackle this 
issue. 
I have concerns that this bill uses a 
tragedy to paint immigrants as more 
dangerous than other people, which is 
false by all available data. The immi-
gration detention system is also in 
need of comprehensive reform, and this 
bill does nothing to improve our immi-
gration system. Instead, the bill im-
poses judicially unreviewable detention 
on immigrants simply charged with 
certain crimes, not convicted. This is 
not consistent with due process. 
Importantly, this bill has not been 
subject to committee review. My un-
derstanding is that senior members of 
the Committee on the Judiciary have 
strong concerns about this bill. 
I also believe that we should not be 
legislating on immigration matters un-
less and until this body takes action to 
permanently 
protect 
Dreamers 
and 
provide them with a path toward citi-
zenship. 
I object. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, once 
again, we are not talking about an 
overall immigration debate. We are 
talking about justice for those families 
who have received none, just as Scott 
Root and Michelle Root have seen the 
death of their daughter at the hands of 
an illegal immigrant and have yet to 
see justice because that illegal immi-
grant was allowed to evade justice. So 
the bill is not about immigration. It is 
about justice. 
I would further argue that, because 
this was an illegal immigrant and 
there was no detainer necessary by 
ICE, the illegal immigrant, who had no 
strong ties to the community and had 
operated under a number of assumed 
names, was able to slip away into the 
shadows. Most legal immigrants and 
citizens of the United States have roots 
somewhere and family somewhere, and 
they can be tracked and monitored 
until they are brought to justice. That 
is not true in this population. Because 
of that, Sarah Root will never have jus-
tice. Her killer will continue to evade 
authorities because he was, simply, not 
detained by ICE. 
We have the opportunity to correct 
this, and it is very unfortunate that, 
today, in the U.S. Senate, we have de-
cided that Michelle Root and Scott 
Root should not see justice for Sarah, 
their daughter, and that other families 
who lose children to illegal immigrants 
should not have the opportunity for 
justice. 
Certain criminal elements, whether 
legal or illegal, can slip away, and that 
is exactly what Eswin Mejia did. He 
had no ties and was able to slip into 
the shadows but left a family won-
dering: How many others will be sub-
jected to the pain and agony that they 
have gone through since the loss of 
Sarah? How many other families will 
go through that? 
I yield the floor.

NO TIKTOK ON GOVERNMENT 
DEVICES ACT 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
would like to make a few brief remarks 
today about TikTok, an app that has 
dominated the news in recent weeks 
and has dominated the internet in re-
cent years. 
As most of you know, TikTok is used 
to create short music videos, and it has 
grown to be one of the most popular 
apps in America. More than 80 million 
Americans now have TikTok on their 
personal phones. It might be easy just 
to assume that this app is harmless— 
music videos, diverting fun—but, let 
me assure you, the security concerns 
surrounding TikTok are real and not 
lighthearted in the least. 
TikTok is currently a major security 
risk, both to our data security and to 
our 
national 
security. 
ByteDance, 
which is TikTok’s parent corporation, 
is based in Beijing, and we all know 
that Chinese corporations and the Chi-
nese Communist Party are, in many 
ways, the same thing. In fact, China’s 
national intelligence law requires it to 
be so. 
ByteDance, as a Chinese company, is 
obligated to collaborate with Chinese 
intelligence 
services, 
including 
by 
sharing data. In fact, all of the data 
that TikTok and ByteDance collect— 
and they collect a lot of data—can be 
routed at a moment’s notice to the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
TikTok is a uniquely intrusive appli-
cation. The company openly admits 
that it tracks users’ locations, it 
tracks users’ keystroke patterns, it 
tracks the filenames on users’ devices. 
TikTok essentially claims the right to 
peer straight through our phones into 
our lives. 
I could go on. TikTok has censored 
content critical of China’s treatment of 
Uighur Muslims and has violated the 
Children’s Online Privacy Protection 
Act. 
Now, in light of all this, in light of 
all we know, it is unthinkable to me 
that we should continue to permit Fed-
eral 
employees—those 
workers 
en-
trusted 
with 
sensitive 
government 
data—to access this app on their work 
phones and computers. Not only is it 
inappropriate; it is irresponsible. This 
app represents a clear and present se-
curity risk at a time when we need to 
be clear-eyed about the threat from the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
That is why I introduced legislation 
to remove TikTok from government- 
owned phones and devices. Now, this is 
just common sense, and it follows steps 
that the Pentagon has started to take 
on its own, but we badly need a uni-
form standard that can apply across all 
Federal agencies and government orga-
nizations. 
Now, over the last few days we have 
heard a lot about a potential acquisi-
tion or sale of TikTok in the United 
States, but no one can say yet what 
will come of those talks. Deals fall 
through all the time, and TikTok is a 
threat to the security of Federal de-
vices right now. Every day we wait is a 
day ByteDance can collect more infor-
mation on and about Americans. Today 
is the day to take action. 
Even if TikTok ends up being sold 
eventually, it will be the responsibility 
of this body, the responsibility of all of 
us, to make sure that no trace of Bei-
jing’s influence remains—none at all. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
for their support, and I particularly 
want to thank Senator RICK SCOTT, 
who has been my partner on this effort 
from the very beginning. It is always a 
privilege to work with and collaborate 
with Senator SCOTT, as we have on so 
many areas, and he has been, as I said, 
at the forefront of this effort from the 
very beginning. He is here today, and I 
would like to yield to him now to make 
a few remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, first I want to thank my col-
league from Missouri. We got here at 
the same time, and both of us saw the 
dangers of Communist China, the dan-
gers of the Communist Party of China, 
and the dangers of the General Sec-
retary of the Communist Party, Xi. 
We have watched a million Uighurs 
get put into prison just for their reli-
gion. We have watched American com-
panies have their technology stolen. 
We have watched as American jobs 
have been stolen. One of the goals that 
both of us had when we came up here 
was to stop this. 
We had the opportunity last year to 
visit the protesters in Hong Kong, and 
we got to hear from them firsthand 
their concern about what Communist 
China would be doing to take away 
their basic rights, rights granted to 
them in the turnover from Great Brit-
ain to China, on paper. But, as we 
know, the Communist Party and the 
General Secretary of the Communist 
Party don’t care about any of these 
things. 
We have watched the Communist 
Party use drones for surveillance. We 
have watched, as my colleague has 
said, TikTok become a worldwide phe-
nomenon. It is an opportunity for the 
Communist Party of China to surveil 
all of our citizens, whatever of our citi-
zens are using it. 
So I want to thank my colleague for 
his effort in this regard—not just this 
but all of his efforts to hold Com-
munist China accountable. There is a 
lot of work to do. As we know, this 
pandemic was much worse because of 
the actions of the Communist Party of 
China. 
So this is a commonsense thing to 
do. We should not have TikTok on Fed-
eral Government phones. This is a good 
first step, but there is a lot more to do 
to continue to hold Communist China 
accountable and to make sure we all, 
as Americans, understand that we are 
now in a cold war. This is not a cold 
war that America started. This is a 
cold war that the Communist Party of 
China started, led by the General Sec-
retary of the Communist Party, Xi, 
and we are going to have to continue 
every day to focus on how we prevent 
them from surveilling us. 
Another thing Americans can do be-
sides making sure you are not using 
TikTok is making sure you are buying 
American products and don’t buy prod-
ucts from Communist China. 
You will do more to hold them ac-
countable. The more we can do things 
like that, it will change the dynamics, 
and, hopefully, maybe eventually Com-
munist China will come to their senses 
and stop being an adversary and even-
tually be merely a competitor. 
I yield back to my colleague from 
Missouri. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Again, I thank Sen-
ator SCOTT for his work on this effort, 
his leadership on this effort, and his 
leadership across the board when it 
comes to standing up to Communist 
China—the Chinese Communist Party. 
I also want to thank my friends Sen-
ator COTTON, Senator ERNST, Senator 
KENNEDY, Senator MCSALLY, and all 
other Senators who have backed this 
legislation, along with Congressman 
KEN BUCK, who has led this effort in 
the House. 
Just 2 weeks ago, this legislation 
passed unanimously out of the Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs Committee. I also want to thank 
my colleagues there, especially Chair-
man JOHNSON, who has been a cham-
pion on this effort and has worked hard 
in the last couple of weeks to make 
sure we can bring this bill to the floor. 
I am encouraged by the bipartisan 
support we have seen in this body to 
hold the Chinese Communist Party ac-
countable, and that includes, by the 
way, holding accountable those cor-
porations that would just do China’s 
bidding. If I have anything to say 
about it, we will not be stopping here. 
Madam President, as in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of Calendar No. 507, S. 
3455. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, the 
most recent count of confirmed Ameri-
cans who have died as a result of 
COVID–19 is 157,551 souls. In my State 
of Maryland, that confirmed number is 
3,402. Those are the confirmed deaths. 
We believe the deaths are even higher. 
Although the United States rep-
resents only 4.3 percent of the world’s 
population, we represent over 26 per-
cent of the COVID–19 infections and al-
most 23 percent of fatalities. These 
numbers are continuing to grow every 
day. 
The Trump administration was ill- 
prepared, inadequate in its response, 
misleading and inconsistent in its mes-
saging, missing in the international 
leadership to deal with this global pan-
demic, and denied the consequences of 
the pandemic on our own constituents. 
Congress took on its responsibility 
by passing major legislation. The pas-
sage of the CARES Act—which was 
passed in March—was the right re-
sponse at that time to do what we 
needed to deal with the pandemic. But 
we knew by May that COVID–19 would 
have a much longer impact on our 
country, would be more difficult to 
control, and we had to take additional 
steps in Congress in order to protect 
our Nation. 
The House did the right thing in 
passing the Heroes Act on May 15. It 
has been almost 3 months, and the Re-
publican leadership in the Senate has 
failed to respond. We need to take ac-
tion that is equivalent to the chal-
lenge—this incredible challenge. 
This is the worst pandemic we have 
seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic, 
over 100 years ago. This is the greatest 
economic challenge that we have faced 
since the Great Depression. This re-
quires bold action in order to protect 
the people of our country. 
The help provided by the CARES Act 
has 
ended. 
Unemployment 
benefits 
have terminated. State and local gov-
ernments are out of resources. The 
small business tools have already been 
used by the small businesses. American 
families need additional help. The un-
employed need help. State and local 
governments need help. Our businesses 
need help. We need to act now and pass 
a comprehensive package to deal with 
this pandemic. 
What should be included in a com-
prehensive package? Let me start first 
with 
the 
health 
challenge. 
I 
was 
pleased that the CARES Act provided 
for a Marshall Plan to deal with the 
health pandemic. But we have since 
learned that this health challenge has 
been different in different commu-
nities. There are disturbing facts about 
the health disparities on the commu-
nities that have been particularly 
hard-hit. Communities of color have 
had higher infection rates, higher hos-
pitalization rates, higher deaths. We 
know that this is in part because of 
systemic discrimination that we have 
seen in our system of healthcare. We 
need to take action. 
Let me give you a few things we 
could do in this next round that could 
help deal with the disparities in the 
health impact. The FMAP, the pay-
ment for Medicaid by the Federal Gov-
ernment to the States—you see, it has 
been estimated that 12 million Ameri-
cans have additionally needed to rely 
on Medicaid as a result of COVID–19. 
The States are unable to act because 
their budgets have been so badly hurt. 
There is a risk factor that they will, 
in fact, even cut back benefits because 
they don’t have the funds to maintain 
the current benefits before COVID–19, 
let alone the additional number of peo-
ple who have been thrown into the need 
for Medicaid. We need to take steps and 
improve the FMAP by the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
Telehealth has proven to be a very ef-
fective tool in dealing with COVID–19. 
We know that people cannot travel, 
cannot go to offices as easily as they 
could, and we have seen a natural de-
sire to do as much telehealth as pos-
sible. We have passed legislation to ex-
pand the types of services and geog-
raphy that can use telehealth services. 
It is very important for rural America, 
very important for the underserved 
community, and very important for the 
transportation-challenged community. 
We need to make those provisions per-
manent. 
I have introduced two pieces of legis-
lation with my colleagues: the REACH 
Act, with Senator TIM SCOTT, and the 
COVID–19 Health Disparities Act, with 
Senator MENENDEZ. These bills work on 
fundamental problems of why COVID– 
19 has had a disparate impact on com-
munities of color. 
We want to make sure we have a 
workforce that represents our commu-
nities. We want to make sure there is 
adequate funding. We want to make 
sure testing is done, targeted to those 
communities that are most vulnerable. 
We want to make sure the vaccine, 
when it is developed, is fairly shared. 
We want to make sure we have out-
reach and education in all commu-
nities. These bills deal with those 
issues. 
The health challenge, as it relates to 
health disparities, needs to be part of 
the legislation that I hope we will be 
considering in the very, very near fu-
ture. 
The legislation needs to include an 
extension of unemployment insurance 
benefits, which is a lifeline for individ-
uals and our economy. Individuals des-
perately need these funds in order to 
take care of basic needs for their fami-
lies. But our economy needs the influx 
of these resources in order to keep our 
economy afloat during COVID–19. 
The Heroes Act, which, again, was 
passed almost 3 months ago, extends 
the $600-a-week payment through the 
end of January; whereas the McConnell 
bill, the HEALS Act, cuts it back to 
$200 and only through October and sets 
up a test for local—on the percentage 
of your previous salary that UI, unem-
ployment insurance, administrators in 
the States tell us is not administrable, 
making a roadblock for those even to 
get the money provided in the HEALS 
Act, the bill introduced by Senator 
MCCONNELL. 
We need to act boldly. The impact on 
our economy is here today and is show-
ing no letup. We need to extend the 
$600, and we need to do it through at 
least January of next year. 
The impact of COVID–19 has been 
cruel to families meeting their basic 
obligations, including housing for both

renters and homeowners. The morato-
rium on eviction and foreclosure has 
now expired. The protection is not 
there. It has been estimated that $12.3 
million American households are now 
at risk of eviction. 
We need to act now. We need to pro-
vide help against eviction and fore-
closure, including direct assistance to 
renters and homeowners. It will not 
only be, again, the right thing to pro-
tect American families during this 
pandemic, but it will also help deal 
with stability in the real estate mar-
ket, making sure we can maintain fi-
nancial viability for that critically im-
portant industry. It is a win-win situa-
tion. 
But look at the contrast between 
what was done in the House and what 
we are asking—the Democrats are ask-
ing—to be considered on the Senate 
floor. The Heroes Act provides $100 bil-
lion to assist renters and $75 billion to 
assist homeowners. The legislation of-
fered 
by 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, 
the 
HEALS Act, provides zero assistance. 
We need to do what is right for Amer-
ican families and make sure that they 
have a roof over their heads. That 
needs to be part of our comprehensive 
response. 
State and local governments are in 
desperate need. You see, they have bal-
anced budget requirements. They have 
to balance their budgets, and now they 
are juggling 2 fiscal years—one for 
most States that ended on June 30 and 
another that started on July 1. In both 
of those fiscal years, they are pro-
jecting large deficits. 
I can tell you, in Maryland alone, the 
fiscal year June 30 deficit is now pro-
jected to grow by $1 billion. 
Here is the challenge. It is up to our 
State and local governments to fund 
things such as first responders and pub-
lic safety and schools and public health 
and critical, essential services, but 
they don’t have the resources to do it. 
Without help from the Federal Govern-
ment, without help in this round, we 
are going to see additional layoffs and 
services that are essential in our com-
munity not being carried out. The 
CARES Act helped, but the CARES Act 
did not deal with the loss of revenue 
sustained by State and local govern-
ments. 
Let’s just use our common sense 
here. What do you think our State and 
local governments are looking at in 
sales tax revenues with so much con-
sumer activity that has not taken 
place? 
Let’s take a look at our income tax 
revenues by our State and local gov-
ernments. With income being so se-
verely restricted, those revenues are 
dramatically reduced. In recent years, 
we have seen the State and local gov-
ernments rely more and more on spe-
cific taxes, generally with hospitality— 
dealing with hotels and car rentals and 
parking. 
Those 
revenues 
are 
non-
existent. 
We need to act. It was for good rea-
son that Governor Hogan, the Repub-
lican chair of the National Governors 
Association for Maryland, and Gov-
ernor 
Cuomo, 
the 
vice 
chair—the 
Democratic Governor from New York— 
came together with all of our Gov-
ernors, saying: You need to help us so 
that we can help our constituents. 
By the way, their constituents are 
our constituents; the same individuals 
are served by State and local govern-
ments and by us in the Congress. 
The Heroes Act, once again, provided 
robust help, recognizing that this pan-
demic will have an impact not only on 
the fiscal year that ended June 30 but 
the fiscal year that began July 1. They 
provide $900 billion of help to State and 
local governments, providing for its 
use for revenue loss and providing di-
rect assistance to our larger subdivi-
sions. 
The legislation that was suggested by 
Senator MCCONNELL on behalf of the 
Republicans contains zero—no help for 
State and local governments. 
One of the essential functions that 
State and local governments need to 
carry out is educating our children in 
our schools. There are different needs 
in different communities. Our aid has 
to be flexible to allow the local school 
districts to do what is right for their 
children as it relates to public safety 
and education. That is our responsi-
bility. 
I recently met with educators in 
Maryland and looked at their chal-
lenges. They went over with me the 
cost challenges that they will face this 
fall, whether they are doing in-class-
room, distant learning, or a hybrid ap-
proach. Safely reopening is costly. Fol-
lowing the CDC guidelines to make 
sure they have the cleaning supplies 
and protective equipment and infra-
structure changes that are necessary 
to safely have students in the class-
room and educators in the classroom; 
how bus routes need to be changed, 
which is going to be more expensive; 
dealing with distant learning and the 
technology that is needed; the tutoring 
and special education needs that are 
going to be more challenging; the 
training of teachers—all this is going 
to cost more funds. State and local 
governments have less funds to operate 
with. 
I particularly want to mention the 
digital divide. We knew before COVID– 
19 that if you did not have access to 
broadband high-speed internet in your 
household, you were at a disadvantage. 
It puts your children at a disadvantage 
because even though they learn at 
school, learning does not stop at the 
end of the schoolday, and access to 
high-speed internet is critically impor-
tant for students. It is also important 
for their parents and for everyone to be 
able to get access to the internet. That 
has really come to light during COVID– 
19. 
Yes, we have a digital divide. We 
know that in rural America, it is more 
difficult to get broadband. We also 
know 
about 
the 
economic 
cir-
cumstances of many families who can’t 
afford the internet. We need to take 
steps to remove that digital divide. We 
need to do that now. We need to do 
that in this legislation so that our chil-
dren can get the maximum opportuni-
ties this fall through distant learning— 
those who are going to participate in 
distant learning. We need to do every-
thing we can so children don’t fall fur-
ther behind because of a lack of access 
to broadband. 
The Heroes Act provides robust fund-
ing both for State and local govern-
ment but also dedicated to education. 
That is what we need to do and make 
sure it is part of a robust response. 
In November, we will be having our 
national elections. There is nothing 
more important to our democracy than 
protecting the free and fair election 
process in America so that every eligi-
ble voter in our country can cast their 
ballot safely, that they can do it with-
out fear for their public health, and 
that we can make sure it is done with-
out influence from foreign actors. That 
requires additional resources. 
I was on the phone with the head of 
our election board in Maryland, talk-
ing about the challenges they have. 
Governor Hogan has suggested a hybrid 
approach to the November elections. It 
is going to cost millions of dollars 
more to conduct that election. The 
local governments don’t have those 
funds. 
The Heroes Act provides funds to pro-
tect the integrity of our election sys-
tem. It needs to be part of it. We all 
know there are foreign actors trying to 
interfere with our elections. We need to 
take steps to make sure it is protected. 
Once again, the bill brought to us by 
the Republicans, the HEALS Act, pro-
vides no help. The Heroes Act provides 
$3.6 billion. 
This week, I was on the phone with 
several of my constituents concerning 
the U.S. Postal Service. The U.S. Post-
al Service is mentioned in the Con-
stitution as one of the primary func-
tions of the Federal Government. It is 
essential. Ask seniors who rely on the 
Postal Service to get their medicines 
in a timely way. We now know how im-
portant it is for timely conducting our 
election process. Yet we are seeing 
delays in service. We are seeing com-
promises to worker safety. We are see-
ing unreasonable restrictions imposed 
by the Postal System, and they have a 
desperate 
need 
for 
additional 
re-
sources. There is a lack of overtime, a 
lack of being able to pick the hours 
that you make your delivery so that 
you 
can 
get 
your 
mail 
delivered 
promptly and in the safest way consid-
ering the weather and COVID–19. All of 
that has been compromised because of 
a lack of resources and, I will also add, 
the management, the Postmaster. 
We need to provide additional help. 
We knew that before COVID–19, and it 
is now even more critical post-COVID– 
19. The Heroes Act provides $25 billion 
for our Postal System. We need to 
make sure that is done. Once again, 
contrast that with the offer that was

made by Senator MCCONNELL, where no 
money was provided for those services. 
Nutrition and the SNAP program are 
all critically challenged as a result of 
COVID–19. We need to make sure we 
make more resources available. The 
Heroes Act provides more resources to 
make sure our families receive the nu-
trition they need. 
One of the things is delivering meals. 
When students are in the classroom, 
they usually get their food there, and 
it is a lot more efficient to do it that 
way. When they are not in the class-
room, it has to be delivered, and that is 
more costly. We have to provide those 
resources to make sure our children 
are protected. 
We have to deal with childcare. Many 
families 
have 
challenges 
with 
childcare. The Heroes Act provides help 
there. 
Essential workers. We talk about es-
sential workers all the time and talk 
about how we applaud them. They are 
our heroes. What do we do for them? 
Well, the House bill deals with haz-
ardous pay to show our appreciation 
through compensation. That is what 
we should do. As we pass comprehen-
sive legislation, that should be part of 
it. 
Let me say that we should also do 
that in regard to our own Federal 
workforce. We should make sure there 
are adequate resources to make sure 
every Federal worker has the protec-
tion they need to stay safe from 
COVID–19. We should do everything we 
can 
to 
encourage 
telework 
when 
telework makes sense for our Federal 
workforce. 
Let me conclude with the area that I 
probably have spent the most time 
with, and that is small business. In re-
gard to small business, we have had a 
bipartisan working group that has 
made tremendous gains on behalf of 
tools that help small businesses. 
Yes, I do want to acknowledge Sen-
ator RUBIO and Senator COLLINS and, 
on the Democratic side, Senator SHA-
HEEN. The four of us worked together 
in the CARES Act to produce the Pay-
check Protection Program, which was 
successful in getting money out quick-
ly to small businesses so they could 
stay alive. 
The problem with the PPP program 
is that we thought that by now, the 
economy would be back on track and 
that small businesses would be able to 
continue without additional help from 
the Federal Government. That is not 
the case. 
Secondly, we learned in the PPP pro-
gram that the underbanked commu-
nity—the minority small businesses 
and the smaller small businesses—was 
left behind when it started because 
they didn’t have the same priority re-
lationship with the lenders as the more 
sophisticated small businesses had. As 
a result, they were denied help. In the 
early stages, their loans were not as 
large; they didn’t get the same type of 
attention. 
As we look at a second round, we 
need to make sure that it is targeted to 
those small businesses that need the 
help and have had revenue loss as a re-
sult of COVID–19. That is targeted to 
the smaller of the small businesses. 
They are the ones that don’t have the 
same degree of resiliency, and they 
need attention at this particular mo-
ment. 
Yes, we need to build up the capacity 
and make sure that mission lenders— 
those that are most sensitive to the 
underserved community—have the ca-
pacity and the volume of loans nec-
essary to reach out so that we don’t 
make the same mistake on the next 
round that was initially made in the 
PPP program. I think we can get that 
done. 
There has been strong bipartisan talk 
about these issues. I think we can 
make progress and get this done. 
There is another program that was 
left out of the HEALS Act by Senator 
MCCONNELL
that 
I 
was 
very 
dis-
appointed about, and that is the eco-
nomic injury disaster loan and grant 
program, the EIDL Program. PPP pro-
vided help to small businesses to deal 
with their payroll expenses and some 
utility expenses, but it didn’t deal with 
the long-term capital needs of a small 
business. 
We know that they need help in addi-
tion to just the paycheck issues. That 
is where the EIDL Program came in. 
You can make both an EIDL loan and 
a PPP loan. Yet we ran out of EIDL 
funds very early. Instead of issuing 
loans up to $2 million, the SBA only 
issued loans up to $150,000. The grant 
program was $10,000 in cash to small 
businesses. It doesn’t have to be repaid. 
That is a lifeline for the smaller small 
businesses. They are the ones that use 
the EIDL Program. They are the small-
er of the small businesses. The SBA im-
posed a $1,000-per-employee cap, so 
they didn’t get the full amount of the 
grant. 
We have to make sure that we pro-
vide additional resources to deal with 
these issues so that the EIDL Program 
can provide long-term financing to 
small businesses. Coupled with the 
PPP program, we can keep small busi-
nesses alive, because we all know they 
are the growth engine of America. 
They are the heart of our economy. We 
need to make sure that is part of the 
next legislation. 
COVID–19 
is 
a 
once-in-a-lifetime 
challenge for us. Pandemics happen 
once in a hundred years. This impact 
on our economy is similar to the Great 
Depression. Let’s rise to the challenge. 
Let’s pass a bipartisan—I would say a 
nonpartisan—bold bill to deal with the 
challenges that are before us, and let’s 
stay here and get it done now. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Georgia.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
FEDERAL 
LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
TRAINING 
CENTER’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
I come to the floor today to ask the 
Senate to pass a resolution honoring 
the 50th anniversary of the Federal 
Law Enforcement Training Center— 
known 
as 
FLETC—that 
is 
headquartered in my home State of 
Georgia. This is the center that trains 
Federal law enforcement officers whom 
President Trump has directed to help 
restore law and order in communities 
across our country faced with dramatic 
increases in violence. 
As part of Operation Legend, the 
FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service, 
and Homeland Security have been de-
ployed to Kansas City, Chicago, Albu-
querque, and Detroit to reduce alarm-
ing and rising levels of violent crime 
across 
America. 
Sadly, 
our 
brave 
women and men of law enforcement are 
under attack. Rioters have physically 
assaulted law enforcement—throwing 
rocks at them and more, causing 
countless injuries. 
It is clear that the recent surge in vi-
olence has been driven in part by a 
lack of leadership from leftwing politi-
cians who refuse to prosecute crime 
and who endorse defunding the police. 
They are clearly intent on politicizing 
and demonizing our law enforcement. 
Today, I am asking the Senate to 
recognize the critical centers that 
train these dedicated officers. For half 
a century, FLETC has trained the next 
generation of highly qualified law en-
forcement. 
Headquartered 
at 
the 
former Glynco Naval Air Station in 
Georgia, FLETC has been instrumental 
in getting violent criminals off the 
streets and protecting our commu-
nities for five decades. 
Every year, FLETC trains nearly 
70,000 officers from 95 Federal law en-
forcement agencies, as well as State, 
local, and Tribal law enforcement 
agencies. This includes agents from 
FBI, DEA, ATF, Customs and Border 
Protection agencies, and others. It in-
cludes the Secret Service, Park Police, 
and U.S. Capitol police officers who 
keep all of us here safe every day. 
In Georgia, FLETC is a cornerstone 
of our coastal community where agents 
train in a mock town complete with 
banks, shops, and hotels to mimic real- 
world scenarios. There are other pro-
grams in cyber terrorism, active shoot-
er threats, and financial forensics. 
FLETC Director Thomas Walters re-
cently said: ‘‘FLETC is the only insti-
tution in the U.S. that has the capa-
bility and capacity to train the new 
Federal officers that will replace thou-
sands of officers that retire from Fed-
eral law enforcement in a typical 
year.’’ 
At a time when law enforcement is 
under more scrutiny, more pressure 
than ever, it is important that we take 
this opportunity to recognize the hard 
work that goes into training and pre-
paring our Federal law enforcement of-
ficers, particularly in my home State 
of Georgia. 
Madam President, as in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of S. Res. 668, submitted earlier 
today.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION SYSTEM 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the pub-
lic health crisis and the economic cri-
sis that are happening right now are 
not happening in a vacuum. 
All 
the 
damage 
caused 
by 
the 
coronavirus and the President’s fail-
ures is layered on top of all the exist-
ing problems of our country, including 
the crisis we have been facing for years 
in the multiemployer pension system. 
More than a million American work-
ers and retirees were already in danger 
of losing the retirement security that 
they earned. These are people who did 
everything right. They spent years 
working on assembly lines, bagging 
groceries, driving trucks, working hard 
to keep this economy going and to pro-
vide for their families. Money came out 
of every single one of their paychecks 
to pay into a pension system. 
People in Washington don’t under-
stand the collective bargaining proc-
ess. They either don’t understand it or 
don’t care to understand it. People give 
up dollars today at the bargaining 
table for the promise of a secure retire-
ment, with healthcare and a pension. 
This crisis affects thousands of Ohio-
ans and people in Indiana, the Pre-
siding Officer’s State. It affects the 
massive Central States Pension Plan, 
the Bricklayers Local 7, the Iron-
workers Local 17, the Ohio Southwest 
Carpenters Pension Plan, the Bakers 
and Confectioners Pension Plan, and on 
and on and on. 
It touches every single State in the 
country. We are talking about our en-
tire multiemployer pension system. If 
it collapses, it will not just be retirees 
who feel the pain. Current workers will 
be stuck paying into pensions they will 
never receive. Small businesses will be 
left drowning in pension liability they 
can’t afford. Small businesses that 
have been in the family for generations 
could face bankruptcy. 
I 
have 
seen 
those 
companies: 
Spangler Candy in Williams County, 
OH; Smucker’s Preserves in Orrville, 
OH. We have seen these companies that 
have been family companies paying 
into this pension plan for generations, 
and workers lose jobs if businesses 
close up shop. 
The effect will ripple through the en-
tire economy. It is not only union busi-
nesses that participate in these plans 
that will close their doors. It would 
devastate small communities across 
the industrial heartland. Small busi-
nesses in these communities already 
are hurt because of this virus. 
These pension plans were already in 
danger prior to February or March, or 
even April or May, when the President 
decided that this was a crisis. Now the 
economic emergency we are in has put 
them in a worse position. 
The House did its part repeatedly. 
First, they passed the Butch Lewis Act. 
More than 2 months ago, they passed 
the Heroes Act, which includes a pen-
sion solution. 
But under Senator MCCONNELL, the 
Senate has done nothing. It is time for 
us to do our part. 
Leader MCCONNELL has refused to do 
anything on pensions. We could have 
fixed this last year. He chose not to. He 
didn’t address it in the HEALS Act 
that he introduced last week, and he 
didn’t address it in the CARES Act 
that we passed back in March. 
There are reports the President, who 
has not been a friend of workers—put-
ting it mildly—was fine with including 
a multiemployer pension fix in the 
CARES 
Act 
if 
Leader 
MCCONNELL 
wanted it. But Leader MCCONNELL 
stopped it, and the President wasn’t 
willing to step in. He is supposed to 
lead 
the 
country, 
but 
he 
has 
outsourced his decision making to Sen-
ator MCCONNELL. 
The Senate must act. If the entire 
multiemployer pension system col-
lapses, it will make our economic crisis 
worse. We knew before this pandemic 
that the pension system could collapse. 
It is only more likely to fail now. If 
that happens, we know who gets hurt 
the most. It is not the Wall Street 
banks 
that 
squandered 
workers’ 
money. It is small businesses. It is 
workers. It is employees who did every-
thing right. Their lives and livelihoods 
will be devastated if Congress doesn’t 
do our job. 
Workers and retirees in Ohio and 
around the country have rallied in the 
name of Butch Lewis, a great Ohioan 
who helped lead this fight and passed 
away far too soon, fighting for his fel-
low workers. His wife, Rita Lewis, has 
continued his fight and has become a 
leader and an inspiration to so many of 
us. 
Rita once told me that retirees and 
workers struggling with this crisis feel 
like they are invisible. These Ameri-
cans aren’t invisible to me. They 
shouldn’t be invisible to this body. 
They aren’t invisible to Speaker 
PELOSI or Leader SCHUMER. They are 
not invisible to Senator SMITH, who is 
from Minnesota and has done yeoman’s 
work on this; or Senator PETERS from 
Michigan, who has spoken out and 
fought for better laws; or Chairman 
NEAL in the House; or Chairman SCOTT 
from Virginia in the House; and many 
of my colleagues who worked for years 
now trying to find a bipartisan solu-
tion. 
We are not giving up. As we know, it 
comes back to the dignity of work. 
When work has dignity, we honor the 
retirement security people earn. When 
you love this country, you fight for the 
people who make it work. 
I urge my colleagues in this body— 
colleagues with healthcare and retire-
ment plans paid for by taxpayers—to 
think about these retired workers and 
the stress—on top of the stress of the 
coronavirus—they are facing. 
Join us. Let’s pass a solution that 
honors their work, that honors the dig-
nity of work, and that keeps our prom-
ise. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all postcloture time 
has expired. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Cronan nomi-
nation? 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. I ask for the 
yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The legislative clerk called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from Tennessee (Mr. ALEXANDER) and 
the Senator from Tennessee (Mrs.

Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator from Tennessee (Mr. ALEX-

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 494 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
wanted to come down and speak today 
about a very important sector of the 
economy for Alaska and for America— 
that is, our fishermen—and some im-
portant, very bipartisan legislation 
that I am trying to move right now 
that I am hopeful everybody can agree 
to. The Senate has agreed to it pre-
viously, and I am really hopeful that 
we can do it again right now. 
I talk about the great State of Alas-
ka being the superpower of seafood. 
Over 60 percent of all seafood—com-
mercial, 
recreational—harvested 
in 
America comes from my great State. 
Sixty percent. So this is a vital indus-
try in my State but also a vital indus-
try in the country. 
As my colleagues know, our fisher-
men are some of the hardest working 
Americans. They are also some of the 
Americans who have been hit the hard-
est by this pandemic. The Saltonstall- 
Kennedy Act helps these hard-working 
men and women across the country by 
providing consistent funding for fish-
eries research and development and re-
lated programs, grant programs—very 
popular. 
Decades ago, Congress authorized a 
group of experts from all around the 
country—Alaska, the east coast—and 
vessel owners, fishermen, and distribu-
tors to advise the Secretary of Com-
merce on how to distribute these funds. 
It makes sense. They are the closest to 
the action. Over time, unfortunately, 
this group was disbanded. Nobody 
thought that was a good idea—abol-
ishing this advisory committee. 
Then you had the National Marine 
Fisheries essentially determine how all 
of 
these 
Saltonstall-Kennedy 
funds 
would be distributed to fishermen. So, 
with all due respect to the DC bureau-
crats, they are the ones making the de-
cisions. 
So we have a bill—my bill—which, by 
the way, passed the Senate previously, 
unanimously, that members in the 
fishing community from all over the 
country be chosen to determine how to 
get these funds out to our fishermen, 
whether in New York or North Carolina 
or Alaska, and everybody thinks that 
makes sense. 
Our fishermen need support right 
now; there is no doubt. They are being 
hammered by this pandemic. So the 
legislation that I am hopefully going to 
be able to pass in the Senate here in a 
couple 
of 
minutes 
has 
cosponsors 
across a broad political spectrum in 
the Senate: Senators CANTWELL, MAR-
KEY, WARREN, MURKOWSKI, and myself. 
I am aware of no policy objections to 
this important piece of legislation. To 
the contrary, it has already passed the 
Senate unanimously. I am, however, 
aware of an unrelated dispute between 
the Democratic leader and some of my 
Senate colleagues from the east coast 
regarding an entirely different bill. I 
respect disagreements over regional 
issues, and I certainly hope my col-
leagues can work them out, but this 
issue is thousands of miles away from 
Alaska and my constituents, the people 
I represent, who are hurting. 
Moreover, the bill I am getting ready 
to introduce, S. 494, helps all fishermen 
nationwide—New York, North Caro-
lina, Alaska. 
The American Fisheries Advisory 
Committee Act, S. 494, should not be 
collateral damage or hostage taken in 
an unrelated fight. If my colleagues 
want to try and work together, I will 
certainly help them work out their dif-
ferences, but I don’t think it is con-
structive to hold hostage this impor-
tant legislation for a fight that is thou-
sands of miles away from Alaska. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of Calendar No. 
179, S. 494; that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, I ask 
unanimous consent that the request be 
modified so that in addition to the re-
quest of the Senator from Alaska, the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 317, S. 908, 
the Fluke Fairness Act. 
I request that the bill be read a third 
time and passed and that motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. TILLIS. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I have 
been in the Senate now for 51⁄2 years, 
and I don’t consider somebody a better 
friend, an advocate for his State than 
Senator SULLIVAN. I have actually 
spent a lot of time—even though Sen-
ator GILLIBRAND and I have differences 
in certain situations, we find ways to 
work together. 
What I have before me, though, is 
something that is very important for 
people to understand. I agree with ev-
erything Senator SULLIVAN said. His 
measure, I suspect, has broad support, 
probably support on its own. But what 
we have here is the addition by the mo-
tion of Senator GILLIBRAND that affects 
my State, North Carolina. It has to do 
with reallocation of quotas. It would 
particularly affect the flounder indus-
try in North Carolina. 
I hope that we are able to work out 
our differences. I hope that we can get 
Senator SULLIVAN’s bill passed. But be-
cause it has been amended to include 
something that hurts my fisheries in 
North Carolina and my commercial 
fishermen at the worst possible time, 
when they are suffering like everybody 
else from the COVID–19 crisis and all 
the challenges that that produces, I do 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, while 
I am disappointed, these are two good 
friends of mine on the Senate floor 
right now, whom I have worked with on 
numerous pieces of legislation. They 
both represent their States very well, 
but this is a missed opportunity for the 
fishermen of America—America, not

just Alaska but for the whole country, 
New York, North Carolina. And I am 
certainly hopeful that my good friend 
from New York and North Carolina can 
work this out. 
I will certainly lend my efforts, my 
staff’s efforts, because we shouldn’t 
have a regional fight blocking what 
will benefit everybody, particularly 
when fishermen right now are really 
hurting. They are one of the sectors of 
the U.S. economy that have been ham-
mered by this pandemic. This kind of 
legislation, although it is not going to 
solve all their problems, shows that we 
are working for them. 
We will live to fight another day here 
soon. I hope that we are able to pass 
my legislation, commonsense legisla-
tion—the American Fisheries Advisory 
Committee Act—which will help every 
fisherman in America. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Hawaii.

CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has revealed the 
people doing the truly essential work 
in our country, and it isn’t the Fortune 
500 CEO, hedge fund manager, or in-
vestment banker. It is the home 
healthcare worker providing essential 
care to homebound seniors or the dis-
abled. It is the delivery truckdriver 
working a 12-hour shift, bringing food 
and medicine and other critical sup-
plies to people who need it. It is a gro-
cery store clerk, working a checkout 
line or stocking shelves to keep up 
with the skyrocketing demand. It is 
the migrant agricultural worker pick-
ing berries or standing on an assembly 
line at a meatpacking plant. It is the 
housekeeper 
or 
custodian 
working 
longer hours to clean our hotels, of-
fices, and other public places. It is the 
childcare worker coming in every day 
to care for other children, while being 
unable to afford care for their own. 
And it is the busdriver who, despite op-
erating on a tightly enclosed space, 
transports hundreds of people to work 
every day. 
These people, and others like them 
doing essential work, are literally risk-
ing their lives every day for the rest of 
us, and they are earning much deserved 
recognition during this pandemic. But 
let me be clear. These workers have al-
ways been essential, even if our eco-
nomic system has not valued the jobs 
they do or treated them with the re-
spect they deserve. 
Valuing 
and 
respecting 
essential 
workers is about more than calling 
them heroes when that is the popular 
thing to do. It is about recognizing and 
calling out how these workers have 
been treated in our economy. And it is 
about doing something to fix it. 
For too long, people doing the work 
now deemed essential during the pan-
demic have been forced to work for low 
wages that are either at or just above 
minimum wage, have jobs that offer no 
paid family or medical leave, have lit-
tle access to affordable childcare, have 
jobs that offer no employer-sponsored 
healthcare coverage, and have been 
forced to work in dangerous conditions. 
Coping with these inequities in nor-
mal times was challenging enough for 
our essential workers, but the pan-
demic, exacerbated by Donald Trump’s 
failure in leadership, is creating new 
problems, and it is making existing 
problems worse. The administration’s 
failure to implement emergency safety 
standards is creating unsafe work-
places for essential workers. 
Meanwhile, it is pushing to provide 
businesses immunity from coronavirus- 
related lawsuits. If they are successful, 
employers would have even less incen-
tive to provide safe workplaces for em-
ployees or to protect customers and 
consumers. 
Its failure to fully and effectively use 
the Defense Production Act means the 
most vulnerable workers continue to 
face shortages of personal protective 
equipment—putting them at greater 
risk for contacting the coronavirus. 
And its failure to implement a national 
testing and contact tracing program 
means that essential workers face test-
ing delays and may never be notified if 
a coworker has tested positive for 
COVID–19. 
As Donald Trump refuses to act re-
sponsibly to keep our essential workers 
safe, this has fallen to States, local 
governments, and the private sector. 
In Hawaii, we are fortunate to have 
responsive State and county govern-
ments, strong unions, and one of the 
lowest uninsured rates in the country, 
thanks to Hawaii’s Prepaid Healthcare 
Act. These advantages, however, have 
not shielded Hawaii’s essential workers 
from the dangers of the pandemic. 
Let me share a few of their stories. A 
few weeks ago, I spoke to a group of 
transit workers who operate The Bus 
in Honolulu. A simple shower curtain 
separates the drivers from passengers 
boarding their buses. Many riders do 
not wear masks, putting the driver and 
other passengers at risk for con-
tracting the virus. 
Drivers are also facing threats and 
physical violence when they ask riders 
to put on a mask. One passenger even 
spat upon a busdriver who asked the 
person to observe social distancing. 
Many 
of 
the 
busdrivers 
live 
in 
multigenerational families. They spoke 
about the fear that they will contract 
the virus on the job and bring it home. 
Three bus operators have already test-
ed positive, including one just this 
week. 
Transit workers in other industries 
have also experienced challenges re-
lated to coronavirus safety. A group of 
Hawaii flight attendants I recently 
spoke with are unable to be tested reg-
ularly due to supply shortages, despite 
showing up to work every day. They 
also spoke about their daily challenges 
convincing passengers to wear masks. 
Essential workers are also providing 
childcare during this pandemic so that 
other essential workers can continue 
to do their job. Katie, a nanny on 
Oahu, whom I heard from recently, has 
provided childcare for essential work-
ers and military families on Oahu dur-
ing the pandemic. Katie lives with her 
mom, who has been battling stage IV 
cancer for nearly 3 years. She is rightly 
concerned about the possibility she 
might bring this virus home with her 
from work. 
In April, Katie received a scare when 
one of the families she worked with 
told her they might have been exposed. 
Katie is like so many essential workers 
in Hawaii and across the country who 
live with uncertainty about their jobs 
and families every day. 
More 
firefighters, 
grocery 
store 
workers, bank tellers, postal workers, 
community health center employees, 
and paramedics tested positive for 
COVID–19 this week. They certainly 
will not be the last. 
Something as simple as showing up 
to work every day shouldn’t be an act 
of bravery, but that is exactly what we 
are expecting from our essential work-
ers every day. If they can show up and 
do their job, Congress can certainly 
step up and do its job. 
It is why Senate Democrats have 
been fighting so hard to pass the He-
roes Act—to bring this to the floor, to 
debate the Heroes Act. The Heroes Act 
includes a number of strong provisions 
that will support essential workers 
during this pandemic. It establishes a 
$200 billion fund to provide up to $10,000 
of hazard pay to each essential worker. 
It requires the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration to issue an 
emergency temporary standard within 
7 days of enactment. It prevents em-
ployers from retaliating against work-
ers who report workplace safety issues. 
It adds another $75 billion for COVID– 
19 testing, contact tracing, and isola-
tion measures. It also provides every 
American access to free treatment for 
COVID–19. It provides access to free 
and affordable childcare options for es-
sential workers who are expected to 
show up to their jobs regardless of 
whether they have someone to look 
after their children, and it provides 
permanent paid sick and family leave 
so that people don’t have to choose be-
tween their jobs and the health of their 
families. 
The Heroes Act is a bold, worker- and 
family-centric bill. We should have 
passed it months ago. Instead, the bill 
has been sitting on the majority lead-
er’s desk for almost 3 months now. He 
called it ‘‘taking a pause.’’ 
The people suffering in our country 
didn’t have the luxury of taking a 
pause 3 months ago, and they certainly 
don’t have the luxury to take a pause 
now. As Senators, we are able to 
telework. We can attend hearings re-
motely. We can stay socially distant. 
Maybe this is one reason some Repub-
lican Senators don’t have sufficient 
empathy or the sense of urgency to 
pass the next COVID relief bill that 
would actually help the busdriver who

can’t drive a bus from home, the UPS 
driver who can’t deliver packages from 
home, the healthcare aide who can’t 
administer medications to seniors from 
home, the agriculture worker who 
can’t pick coffee beans from home, and 
the postal worker who can’t deliver the 
mail from home. 
Millions of people are suffering in our 
country today. They should be able to 
count on the Senate to step up and 
take action to help them. At this very 
moment, 
negotiators 
are 
deciding 
whom we will help and who will be left 
behind. Democrats are fighting to pro-
tect essential workers and help the un-
employed. 
Republicans are fighting to protect 
businesses from their own negligence 
and allow corporate executives—cor-
porate executives—to write off their 
business lunches. These very different 
priorities reflect very different values 
and point out what is at stake in these 
negotiations. Protecting and assisting 
essential workers is a value. It isn’t 
enough to simply tell them ‘‘thank you 
very much’’ and call them heroes. Ac-
tions speak louder than words. It is 
time for us to act. It is long past time 
for us to act. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. RES. 458 
Mr. 
LANKFORD. 
Mr. 
President, 
thousands of radical Islamists rallied 
on Friday in Northwestern Pakistan in 
support of a man who earlier this week 
walked into a courtroom in the city of 
Peshawar and gunned down a U.S. cit-
izen on trial for blasphemy. That is 
how the New York Times started its 
article on this issue last week. The 
American, Tahir Naseem, died of his 
wounds before he could be taken to the 
hospital while the gunman was taken 
into custody. 
The U.S. State Department said 
Naseem was standing trial after being 
lured to Pakistan from his home in Illi-
nois. He was entrapped by the coun-
try’s 
controversial 
blasphemy 
law, 
which international rights groups have 
sought to have repealed. The blas-
phemy law calls for the death penalty 
for anyone found guilty of insulting 
Islam, but, in Pakistan, the mere alle-
gation of blasphemy can cause mobs to 
riot and vigilantes to kill those who 
have been accused. Pakistani officials 
said Naseem was charged with blas-
phemy after he declared himself to be 
Islam’s prophet. That was the accusa-
tion that was laid against him. 
At the rally in Peshawar, which was 
in support of the person who murdered 
the American citizen, the demonstra-
tors carried signs that praised the mur-
derer for the killing and called for his 
immediate release from jail. They said 
he killed Naseem because the govern-
ment was too slow in prosecuting blas-
phemy cases. 
Last 
December—8 
months 
ago—I 
filed a resolution to speak with a uni-
fied voice on what I considered to be a 
nonpartisan issue—a simple statement 
from this Congress condemning blas-
phemy laws across the world wherever 
they exist. We are a nation that stands 
for the ability of every individual to 
choose any faith, to change one’s faith, 
or for one to have no faith at all. That 
is a basic human right. Yet, according 
to the U.S. Commission on Inter-
national Religious Freedom, 84 coun-
tries—more 
than 
one-third 
of 
the 
world’s countries—have a blasphemy 
law on the books, including in Paki-
stan, where an American citizen was 
murdered last week under an accusa-
tion of blasphemy. 
This resolution that I filed 8 months 
ago with the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee has already moved in the House. 
The House Foreign Affairs Committee 
worked through the process of this res-
olution in March of this year and 
passed it unanimously. It was spon-
sored by Democrat JAMIE RASKIN and 
had the support of multiple Democrats 
on the Foreign Affairs Committee. It 
was overwhelmingly moved while this 
resolution—a mere eight pages—has 
sat, unmoved, for 8 months. 
The Vice Chair of the U.S. Commis-
sion on International Religious Free-
dom, who was appointed by Speaker 
PELOSI, has said that USCIRF—that is 
this organization—has noted countless 
times that Pakistan’s blasphemy law 
inflames interreligious tensions and 
too often leads to violence. He urges 
the State Department to enter into a 
binding agreement with the Pakistani 
Government that includes the repeal of 
blasphemy provisions in the Pakistan 
Penal Code. I could not agree more. 
The Trump administration has spo-
ken out on this, and the House of Rep-
resentatives has spoken out on this. 
The U.S. Commission on International 
Religious 
Freedom, 
a 
nonpartisan 
group, has spoken out on this. We in 
the Senate should also speak out on it, 
and the time to speak out on it is when 
we have just had an American citizen 
murdered overseas because of these 
laws. It is prime time to move this. 
This is something that, I believe, 
should be passed by unanimous con-
sent. How could we oppose the move-
ment of something like this? 
Now, I have heard that, possibly, we 
should slow this whole thing down be-
cause resolutions like this should have 
a fulsome committee process. They 
should be heard and marked up and 
read and reread, and 8 months is not 
enough time to review them. The prob-
lem with that is that, last week, a 
Democratic resolution on elections in 
Belarus was filed. It was never heard 
by the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions here in the Senate. Yet it was 
discharged, placed on the hotline yes-
terday morning, and cleared last night. 
So, for Democratic bills, they don’t 
have to go through the committee 
process, apparently. They can just 
move through on their own because the 
Republicans have not opposed those. 
The Republicans take the time to read 
these on their own—to go through the 
resolutions and make decisions on 
them. That resolution had a majority 
of Democratic sponsors, but it also had 
Republican sponsors. 
This resolution is sponsored by CHRIS 
COONS and me. We also consider it to be 
a nonpartisan issue. Something that 
has sat in the committee for 8 months, 
waiting, surely can move when some-
thing that was filed last week and 
never heard by the Committee on For-
eign Relations could move on the hot-
line in a single day. 
So I bring this resolution because I 
think we should speak out on this as 
the House has already spoken out on it, 
as the State Department has already 
spoken out on it, as the Trump admin-
istration has already spoken out on it, 
and as USCIRF has already spoken out 
on it. Why wouldn’t 100 Senators speak 
out 
on 
this 
blasphemy 
resolution 
today? 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Foreign 
Relations be discharged from further 
consideration and that the Senate now 
proceed to S. Res. 458. I further ask the 
resolution be agreed to, the preamble 
be agreed to, and the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, in 
reserving the right to object, first of 
all, I note that the customary path for 
bills and resolutions is for them to be 
considered by their committees of ju-
risdiction, marked up through regular 
process, and reported out to the Senate 
floor. 
I understand that many Members of 
this body have noble causes and good 
ideas that fall under the jurisdiction of 
the Senate Committee on Foreign Re-
lations. Unfortunately, the chairman 
has only held one real legislative 
markup this entire year—in May. That 
one meeting, which included multiple 
pieces of substantive, bipartisan ef-
forts, was ended prematurely before 
many pieces of vital legislation could 
be acted upon and without having a 
vote on even a single amendment. 
While the minority was strongly sup-
portive of more legislative activity, 
the chairman pulled down another leg-
islative markup, without any expla-
nation, in the first week of July and 
yet another one, just this week, with-
out any explanation. 
Regardless of those facts, I can tell 
you that I don’t believe the majority, 
which has the convening power—and, 
lately, when it does list a committee

August 6, 2020 
hearing or a markup unilaterally de-
cides to do so—has ever sought com-
mittee activity for Senator LANKFORD’s 
resolution. This is the first time—and I 
would assume for others—that many 
are seeing it. 
He mentions the 8 months. I am sure 
that he could speak to the chairman of 
the committee by virtue of his being of 
the majority party, the Republican 
Party, 
but 
the 
chairman 
hasn’t 
brought his resolution forward. If he is 
chagrined that for 8 months it has been 
languishing in the committee, it is be-
cause Chairman RISCH
has neither 
asked for it to be included when there 
was a business markup nor asked for it 
now. 
It is true that, on occasion, a resolu-
tion gets released. I did one for ROB 
PORTMAN regarding Otto Warmbier—it 
was the anniversary of the tragic mo-
ment—and it was released to the Sen-
ate floor. Yet there are many other 
critically important legislative items 
that have been marked up and are 
ready for action on the floor. 
Last December, the Defending Amer-
ican Security from Kremlin Aggression 
Act, or what we know as DASKA, 
passed out of the Committee on For-
eign Relations, through regular order, 
with a strong bipartisan vote. It has 
been pending on the floor for nearly 8 
months. Over the course of that time, 
Russian 
aggression 
has 
manifested 
itself in Syria, Libya, and on the 
streets of Europe, where opponents of 
the Putin regime have been assas-
sinated. 
This past week, all Senators were 
briefed on the broader question of for-
eign interference in our elections, and 
we know it is a threat and that it is 
real and growing. If the Senate should 
dedicate any time to a foreign policy 
issue, it seems to me that this should 
be it. Our election is in 88 days. Yet the 
Senate trudges along, blind to the 
threat before our very eyes. 
DASKA should be the business of the 
Senate floor, and it should be passed. 
Similarly, the Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations passed a Saudi Ara-
bia bill more than a year ago, and it 
has been waiting for floor action. I 
could go on and on. 
Now, I don’t want to undermine the 
importance of the issue that Senator 
LANKFORD is trying to address. Around 
the world, we see autocratic rulers im-
posing blasphemy laws as a way of tar-
geting the freedom of religion and 
speech of those who enjoy that or 
should enjoy that freedom of religion 
and speech. His resolution rightly con-
demns blasphemy laws for violating 
international human rights standards, 
and it raises serious concerns. 
Yet I would just say that we need to 
have a moment of self-reflection. This 
resolution doesn’t say anything about 
this administration’s disparaging atti-
tudes and comments about certain reli-
gions and ethnicities. How can we have 
this conversation without addressing 
President Trump’s reported expression 
of approval of concentration camps for 
Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang? 
Under the leadership of the President 
and Secretary Pompeo, the administra-
tion has downplayed human rights 
abuses in countries from North Korea 
to the Persian Gulf; has coddled a dic-
tator who ordered the horrific murder 
of journalist and U.S. resident Jamal 
Khashoggi; verbally attacked the prin-
ciple of freedom of the press; instituted 
the Muslim ban that sent chills around 
the world about the U.S. commitment 
to freedom of religion; and slashed the 
admission of refugees, many of whom 
were persecuted religious minorities. 
Certainly, the Committee on Foreign 
Relations in the Senate should be say-
ing something about that record as 
well. 
As a matter of fact, between fiscal 
year 2017 and 2018, the administration 
reduced the admission to the United 
States of Christian refugees by 36 per-
cent and of Muslim refugees by 85 per-
cent. We should also be discussing how 
the U.S. Envoy to the Organization of 
Islamic Cooperation has been left va-
cant for over 3 years. 
In closing, I believe addressing blas-
phemy laws and standing up for the 
freedom of religion and the protection 
of religious minorities is urgent and 
warrants much further attention from 
both the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions and of this body as a whole. 
I urge Senator LANKFORD to work 
with Chairman RISCH to schedule a leg-
islative markup so that this resolution, 
as well as other important initiatives, 
can be considered under regular order 
because, when his resolution or others 
are before it, there is an opportunity to 
amend them, to augment them, and to 
include other issues, even within the 
context of the issue of religious free-
dom. 
That is not provided here, and for 
those reasons I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
want to ask my colleague if there is a 
difference between this resolution and 
the resolution on elections in Belarus 
that was filed last week, was dis-
charged, and then passed on the hotline 
yesterday. 
Obviously there are lots of other 
issues about elections. There has been 
a lot of conversation that we have had 
about elections worldwide and about 
security of elections, but that par-
ticular resolution wasn’t held up to go 
through the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee to discuss international elec-
tions more. It was discharged, and it 
was sent to the floor on a hotline, and 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
alike 
agreed on that resolution and passed it 
through. 
Is there a substantive difference be-
tween this resolution and that one? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. The issues that 
were expressed in Senator DURBIN’s res-
olution had been issues before the com-
mittee on the issue of Belarus. As a 
matter of fact, even today, the nomi-
nee to be the U.S. Ambassador has been 
discussed. So that issue has been dis-
cussed. 
Unfortunately, although I think it 
has merit, the issue of religious free-
dom, as you have defined in your reso-
lution, has not. So at least the sub-
stance of the issue has been the possi-
bility of the debate. 
I would simply say that I know you 
are highlighting that one resolution. 
Yes, our colleague from Ohio, Senator 
PORTMAN, brought to my attention the 
anniversary of Otto Warmbier, and it 
was happening before—and he said: I 
did not ask for it to come before the 
committee. I thought that it should, 
and it fell between the cracks. So we 
agreed. But that doesn’t mean that ev-
erybody is going to come to the floor 
and not give the committee members 
the chance to work on resolutions and 
to have their views cast on that resolu-
tion for the full body to consider. 
Mr. 
LANKFORD. 
Reclaiming 
my 
time, it is a lesson learned because the 
challenge of the Foreign Relations 
Committee is that almost nothing has 
been able to get through—no Ambas-
sadors, no resolutions. Everything is 
not good enough. Everything is not big 
enough. 
Quite 
frankly, 
everything 
doesn’t attack the Trump Presidency 
and the Trump State Department, 
which really becomes the issue. 
So even things that are nonpartisan, 
that we all have wide agreement on— 
that the House of Representatives was 
100 percent in agreement on—can’t 
even get a hearing here, can’t even 
move through. And when an American 
citizen is killed over a blasphemy law 
issue, we still can’t speak as the Sen-
ate. It is unfortunate. 
There are things that we disagree on 
strongly as a body, but protecting the 
lives of American citizens who are 
being murdered because of a blasphemy 
law in Pakistan should not be an area 
of disagreement for us. 
Standing up for religious liberty, 
speaking out with this one bill—if 
there are other issues, do 10 more. It is 
a basic American freedom. We should 
do multiple resolutions on freedom of 
the press, freedom of speech, freedom 
for people to live their faith worldwide. 
That is who we are as Americans. So do 
a bunch of them. Speak out on them, 
but don’t stop us from speaking at all 
on issues where we should speak with a 
common, unified voice. 
We can do better, and we should do 
better, and we will in time. But right 
now, we are still not speaking with a 
clear voice on blasphemy and the death 
of Americans worldwide, and that is 
something we should all look at and 
say is one more example of our not get-
ting the job done in the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
take offense at the suggestion that 
nothing is good enough for the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, that 
nothing gets done. There are 160 am-
bassadorial employees—and of that

August 6, 2020 
rank—who have passed through the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
overwhelmingly with bipartisan sup-
port. 
Every year, we get the State Depart-
ment’s budget. Every year, we have a 
budget that is decimated, including for 
the issues that my colleague cares 
about. It is because those of us on the 
committee who believe in the power of 
diplomacy in the State Department 
work feverishly to restore and enhance 
the budget of the State Department 
that it has been able to carry out its 
mission. But the budget that the Sec-
retary of State comes before the com-
mittee to defend and advocate for is a 
huge, huge consequence. 
Look, we are constantly doing things 
to protect the lives of American citi-
zens in the committee. I could enu-
merate a number both of resolutions as 
well as legislative language that would 
have far-reaching—I mean, I am in 
favor of resolutions. They are an ex-
pression of sentiment. But legislation 
that puts into action within our laws 
the ability of countries that conduct 
blasphemy and other types of crimes 
against people who simply want to pur-
sue their religious views—that would 
be far more consequential. 
So there is a lot that goes on in the 
committee, and a lot of it has actually 
been bipartisan. By the same token, if 
our colleague is chagrined that not 
enough is moving through the com-
mittee, talk to the chairman because 
you can’t move anything through the 
committee if you don’t have com-
mittee 
business 
markups, 
and 
we 
haven’t had one—I think except for 
one—and we are in August. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The Senator from Ohio. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
think we are all a little frustrated 
right now because the negotiations on 
the next COVID–19 package seem to be 
at a standstill. If you talk to the nego-
tiators and you even read the press ac-
counts, which are pretty open, what 
they say is that they are deadlocked. 
One of the main reasons they are dead-
locked is over this issue of unemploy-
ment insurance. 
Now, recall, back in the CARES Act, 
there was an extension of a Federal 
supplement to unemployment insur-
ance. So we put in place a $600 Federal 
benefit on top of the State benefits. 
At the time, there were concerns 
about whether that would lead to peo-
ple on unemployment insurance get-
ting more money than they would at 
work, and there was actually an 
amendment here on the Senate floor 
regarding that. Although it did not 
pass, I think pretty much every Repub-
lican supported it with that concern. 
In fact, that is what has happened. If 
you look at what has happened over 
the past couple of months, as the $600 
has been put in place, it clearly has 
often led to people making more on un-
employment insurance than they can 
make at work. 
In fact, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, which is a nonpartisan group here 
in the U.S. Congress that analyzes 
some of these economic issues, has said 
that if someone is on unemployment 
insurance today, they are likely to be 
making substantially more than some-
one who is not on unemployment insur-
ance. In other words, people are mak-
ing more not to work than to work. 
CBO says: ‘‘Roughly five of every six 
recipients would receive benefits that 
exceeded the weekly amounts they 
could expect to earn from work during 
those months’’ if you were to extend 
this until the end of the year. 
In other words, they are saying that 
80 percent of UI recipients would make 
more on unemployment insurance than 
they would have at their old jobs— 
meaning that if you followed where the 
Democratic negotiators are in keeping 
$600 in place until the end of the year, 
there would be an unprecedented dis-
incentive to go to work in this coun-
try. 
I think that is widely acknowledged. 
The University of Chicago has a study 
that isn’t quite 80 percent; it says 68 
percent, though. I don’t think anybody 
disputes the fact that most people on 
unemployment insurance are making 
more than they would if they were at 
work. 
When I talk to my Democratic col-
leagues about that, they are hearing 
the same thing I am hearing from 
small business owners—by the way, 
from nonprofits, from employers of all 
sizes and all stripes—saying that it is 
tough to get people to come back to 
work when they can make more on un-
employment insurance by not working. 
I think a lot of my Democratic col-
leagues agree. It is good to get people 
back to work—get back to work safely, 
yes, and we ought to be sure that the 
employers are following the guidelines 
of the Centers for Disease Control and 
others. But it is good to get people 
back to work because then they are re-
connected with their healthcare, if 
they have it, with their retirement sav-
ings, and with training. That connec-
tion to work is a positive thing, pro-
viding people with dignity and self-re-
spect. It comes with work, so we should 
all be for that. 
Yet when you see what is happening 
in this negotiation, this is being stalled 
because Democrats are being intran-
sigent. They are saying stubbornly: We 
are going to stick to $600. 
Today, there was a press conference 
with Speaker PELOSI and Democratic 
Leader SCHUMER, and that is exactly 
what they said. Here is the quote: ‘‘We 
have said that we are going to have 
$600.’’ This is necessary. 
I know that that is not where the 
rank and file are here in this Chamber 
because I have talked to a number of 
my Democratic colleagues about this. 
They realize that the $600—even those 
who thought it might have been nec-
essary at the time, and I voted for the 
package at a time when we had unem-
ployment that was such a shock and so 
high, and people were in such need of 
immediate cash. But also I have heard, 
again, from so many of my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle, that the $600 
is something they are hearing about 
more and more back home from the 
employers who say: We can’t get people 
back to work. 
So the $600 is something that there 
needs to be some flexibility on to come 
up with a smarter way to ensure that 
people can continue to get a Federal 
supplement because we do continue to 
have relatively high unemployment in 
this country. In my own State of Ohio, 
there is almost 11 percent unemploy-
ment. But let’s not have it be so much 
that people are incentivized not to 
work. That doesn’t help anybody. 
There are ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs all 
over my State. I was at a Ford plant 
recently, where they have 25 percent 
absenteeism, which they attribute to 
this issue. I have been at a lot of small 
businesses, which is where probably 
most of my colleagues are hearing a lot 
of concerns about the fact that they 
can’t get people who used to work for 
them to come back, and they certainly 
can’t hire the new people they need, 
even though they are reopening safely 
and doing everything they are supposed 
to do in terms of the guidelines. They 
are having a tough time getting back 
to work. 
There is an auto plant in Ohio where 
the white-collar workers are now work-
ing on the assembly line because they 
can’t get enough workers who would 
normally have those jobs to work on 
the assembly line. 
So this is a problem right now, and I 
think everybody acknowledges it ex-
cept the Democratic negotiators in this 
negotiation. 
Now, I don’t think we are actually as 
far apart as the media accounts would 
suggest because there are lots of ideas 
out there. One idea, by the way, makes 
a lot of sense to me, and I am going to 
offer this in a moment as a resolution 
for the Senate to take up. I think this 
is the ultimate common sense—let’s 
keep $600 in place for now while we ne-
gotiate something. Let’s have an ex-
tension for another week on the unem-
ployment insurance at 600 bucks just 
so we can negotiate something. What 
you don’t want is people to fall off the 
cliff, and that is starting to happen 
now. 
The $600 expired last Friday. So 6 
days ago it expired, and 6 days ago, 7 
days ago, MARTHA MCSALLY, a Senator 
from Arizona, came to this floor and 
offered this same unanimous consent 
request, saying: Let’s just have 600 for 
another week. CHUCK
SCHUMER, the 
Democratic leader, objected—instead, 
offering the $3.5 trillion package from 
the House. But he didn’t respond to 
why we wouldn’t at least give the nego-
tiators a week to come up with some-
thing. 
So I am going to offer that same 
thing today because I do think it is not

fair to have a cliff. I don’t think there 
should be a cliff. I think people should 
be able to have some level—but not at 
$600 because that is now understood by 
everybody 
to 
mean 
that 
you 
are 
disincentivizing work. 
Americans are a generous people. 
Back in 2008 and 2009, when we had the 
great recession, we also did this. By 
the way, we did $25 a week then. So for 
Democrats who say this is unprece-
dented, well, we had 10 percent unem-
ployment back then—very high unem-
ployment—and we did $25. I think we 
should do a lot more than that now but 
not so much that people are making 
more by not working than by working. 
There are a lot of ideas out there. 
Again, my ideas—ideas of individual 
Members—may not be what this body 
chooses to use, and that is fine. We are 
not all going to get our way, but we 
should be able to come up with a com-
promise here. 
My idea is to have a return-to-work 
bonus, so that you are getting the 600 
bucks, but you can take some of that 
money back with you when you go 
back to work. That would create an in-
centive to get people back to work and 
connect people to those businesses as 
we talked about and the importance of 
doing that. 
But there are other ideas as well. 
There is a plan that was put out re-
cently by two Obama administration 
veterans, former Treasury Secretary 
Timothy Geithner and economic ad-
viser Jason Furman. They joined with 
a former H.W. Bush economist Glenn 
Hubbard to put out a proposal from of 
the Aspen Institute, hardly a conserv-
ative group, that proposes that the un-
employment system—not at $600 but to 
continue at a cap of $400 and have it be 
determined based unemployment level 
for the State. 
The way unemployment works in the 
States is the States have a benefit, and 
this Federal benefit is on top of it. 
Most States provide on average about 
50 percent of benefits; $600 is over 100 
percent. It is over 130 percent, in fact. 
So 
this 
solution—again, from two 
Obama administration economists—is 
that you have $400 as a cap, when un-
employment in those States is above 15 
percent and zero Federal supplement 
when the State is at 7 percent or less. 
It phases out entirely. That is one bi-
partisan solution that is out there. In-
stead of insisting on $600, I would hope 
at least there is a discussion of those 
kinds of proposals. 
Senator ROMNEY has a proposal out 
there that takes the amount from $500 
per week in August to $400 to an 80-per-
cent wage replacement phasing out al-
together by year-end. Senator MCCON-
NELL put his proposal out for a $200 
amount over a 2-month period as a 
transition and then goes to a percent of 
wages. His percent of wages is 70 per-
cent of wages. Again, there is no State 
that is that high. The States are 40 per-
cent, 50 percent, 60 percent, in that 
range. 
So there are ideas out there, and yet 
the Democrats keep coming back again 
and again to this notion of: We want it 
all or nothing. I will state to my col-
league from Oregon who is here on the 
floor, and I am glad he is—he did a very 
good job for Democrats negotiating 
this proposal. I told him about it at the 
time. I know he took pride on it, and 
he should have. 
But we also need now to figure out 
where we go, going forward. None of us 
should 
want 
people 
to 
be 
disincentivized from going to work. We 
should not have a situation like we 
have now where, again, you have the 
leaders on the Democratic side, Speak-
er 
PELOSI
and 
Democratic 
Leader 
SCHUMER, saying, ‘‘Today, we have said 
that we are going to have $600. This is 
necessary.’’ 
We have to be able to show some 
flexibility here to be able to break this 
impasse, to be able to provide for peo-
ple who lost their jobs through no fault 
of their own and need some help, but 
not continue to have this policy in 
place that doesn’t work for our econ-
omy, for small businesses, and for 
workers themselves. Let’s get the poli-
tics out of this. Let’s do something 
that makes sense to be able to move 
forward on this broader crisis, and I 
think if we can fix the unemployment 
insurance issue, we are likely to get 
there. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Will my colleague 
from Ohio yield? 
Mr. PORTMAN. I would be happy to 
yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to thank the Senator from Ohio 
for his great leadership on this and so 
many other issues. I see my colleague 
from Oregon is on the floor as well. 
I want to talk about an issue that 
Senator PORTMAN just touched on, but 
it is really the key to what is going on 
here, and that it is good faith. Are ne-
gotiations happening in good faith? Or 
are they not? 
Sometimes, it is hard to tell. Some-
times, there is posturing, but, last 
week at this time, Senator PORTMAN, 
Senator MCSALLY, and myself were on 
the floor with regard to discussing Sen-
ator MCSALLY’s very simple unanimous 
consent resolution which said as we ne-
gotiate—hopefully, in good faith—the 
difference between what we have put 
forward—the 
HEALS 
Act—and 
the 
Speaker Pelosi bill from early May—a 
bit of a stale $4 trillion bill, one-third 
of which has nothing to do with the 
pandemic—but as we are trying to ne-
gotiate in good faith, let’s move for-
ward with an extension of unemploy-
ment so people who are hurting can 
continue to rely on it. That happens all 
the time in the Senate. 
So what happened? The minority 
leader came down to the Senate floor 
and blocked it. He blocked it, and his 
response was: I am going to block this 
1-week extension unless the Repub-
licans take the entire $4-trillion Heroes 
Act. That is what he said. If you are 
watching or paying attention, that is 
the definition of not negotiating in 
good faith, and every Senator knows it. 
All 100 of us know it. That was not a 
good faith maneuver. 
What I predicted was the minority 
leader of the U.S. Senate, despite that 
maneuver which is going to hurt mil-
lions of Americans, did it because he 
thinks the national media will give 
him a pass, that no one in the national 
media will say: Boy, oh boy, the minor-
ity leader just blocked a reasonable re-
quest for an extension to help people. 
But he thinks, and I think with good 
reason, that the national media won’t 
blame him for what he just did, so he 
did it with no explanation. That is not 
good faith. By definition, coming down 
saying, Take my $4 trillion package or 
you won’t get a 1-week extension of un-
employment, that is not good faith. 
Let me mention one other point 
which Senator PORTMAN
mentioned. 
Now, on this tough issue of unemploy-
ment insurance—and Senator PORTMAN 
has been a leader on this—I was talk-
ing to some of my Democratic col-
leagues about them today. 
By the way, most of them don’t be-
lieve that $600 until January is a good 
idea for the reasons Senator PORTMAN 
mentioned. 
Again, to have the minority leader of 
the U.S. Senate and Speaker PELOSI 
just say: 600 bucks, take it or leave it? 
Colleagues, 
you 
all 
know—we 
all 
know—that is not good faith. That is 
not good faith. 
It is starting to feel like the minor-
ity leader and the Speaker are not ne-
gotiating in good faith right now. I 
hope they are—I know a lot of my 
Democratic colleagues are—but people 
have to remember, regardless of what 
party you are in, Americans are hurt-
ing. They need help. We have one foot 
in the recovery, one foot still in the 
pandemic. But what we need as we ne-
gotiate this package is good faith. 
So I want to thank my colleague 
from Ohio again for his strong leader-
ship on this and so many other issues. 
I am certainly going to be supportive 
of unanimous consent requests which 
we made at this time just last week to 
help people—not controversial, a week 
extension as we negotiate. It happens 
all the time here in the Senate. 
I certainly hope my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are not going to 
say, No, take my whatever, or we are 
not going to do it, because it doesn’t 
look or feel like good faith. Do you 
know who is hurting by that? Do you 
know who is being hurt by that? The 
American people, who are suffering. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague 
from Alaska. 
Reclaiming my time, I think he has 
made a good point. We are not talking 
about a negotiation here. We are talk-
ing about a weeklong extension of the 
existing $600 per week, so we could en-
able people to have some certainty and 
predictability on lives. 
I have heard from folks back home on 
unemployment asking: What are you 
doing? Why can’t you come to an 
agreement?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5247 
August 6, 2020 
We talked about why. The Democrats 
don’t seem interested about moving off 
their proposal, and they said it again 
today. Maybe they think this is good 
politics—maybe they think this is 
something worth hurting these people 
who are looking, to see if I am going to 
get my unemployment or not. 
I had a tele-townhall last night with 
a woman whose husband works in the 
hospitality business, and he has lost 
his job, and everybody else in that 
business has told him: Sorry, we are 
not open for business. He does need the 
help. She didn’t insist on $600, but she 
said: Give us some certainty that 
something will go forward. 
So that is what this is about. This is 
just to say give us a week at $600, the 
full amount, in order to negotiate 
something that makes more sense for 
the economy, for small businesses, and 
for workers. This MARTHA
MCSALLY 
motion which was offered earlier this 
week and last week, we are going to 
offer today. It is a unanimous consent. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of the bill at the desk; I fur-
ther ask that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, the Senate Repub-
licans have spent much of this week of-
fering this idea of a 1-week extension of 
the $600 unemployment insurance sup-
plement. They have done this as an al-
ternative to spending the week doing 
real negotiating, which is what I and 
many Senate Democrats have been 
calling for, for not just days but weeks 
and weeks—literally, months—as we 
called for an advanced proposal. 
In my view, the only thing worse 
than what the Republicans have done, 
cutting off desperately needed unem-
ployment insurance to millions of fam-
ilies and communities, would be to 
allow a bill to pass that promises 
money without actually delivering it. 
That is snake oil, and I am going to be 
very specific in describing why that is 
the case. 
Even if this short-term extension 
were to pass, experts and State agen-
cies have said in very clear terms that 
States don’t have enough time to re-
program their systems and avoid a 
lapse in benefits. A lot of them just 
have, as my colleague from Ohio 
knows—I was talking about it for days 
in the Finance Committee room—that 
these State unemployment systems are 
not equipped to switch the benefits on 
and off. These short-term extensions 
won’t work and don’t work administra-
tively. 
Nobody following this debate has to 
take my word for it. That is what the 
National Association of State Work-
force Agencies have said. 
I think there was a comment about, 
well, this is an image problem. It is a 
problem of the national media. Well, I 
would say, colleagues, the national 
media has been repeating what I just 
said, which are the exact views of peo-
ple who aren’t Democrats or Repub-
licans, they are the administrators of 
this crucial program. 
A short-term extension isn’t enough 
for the hard-working Americans rely-
ing on this lifeline who don’t have jobs 
to go back to. What about next week 
and the week after? There is going to 
be promises for week after week that 
also can’t get the money to people so 
they can make rent and buy groceries. 
The only responsible route is to agree 
to the extension that really looks to 
economic conditions, ties these bene-
fits to economic conditions and then 
lower the payments only when it is ap-
propriate to do so, and that means 
when the economy is in recovery, not 
when it is facing the kind of dramatic 
contraction that we all were so con-
cerned about last week. 
To me, this is all part of an effort to 
deflect the fact that when I—and I am 
just going to talk about myself specifi-
cally—but 
Senator 
SCHUMER, 
the 
Speaker sent letter after letter calling 
for negotiations because everybody 
knew there was a cliff. I said it repeat-
edly. I said: Don’t go home, Leader 
MCCONNELL. Stay here. This cliff is 
coming, end of July, last weekend, 
when people got the checks. 
So there was a comment about unem-
ployed folks being pushed off the cliff. 
Well, I am here to tell you, it was Sen-
ate Republicans by their inaction who 
pushed those workers off the cliff. 
Now, what is needed is a long-term 
solution that ensures the extra $600 re-
mains available for as long as this dev-
astating crisis continues. 
I heard my colleagues talk about 
workers. A lot of workers who were 
laid off once and then brought back 
have been laid off again. That is really 
representative of the challenge. 
I also want to mention, as we talk 
about ideas—I heard my colleagues 
talk about it—another big snake oil 
idea coming out of the White House 
that somehow an Executive order is 
going to accomplish all of this. We hear 
the words ‘‘Executive order.’’ That 
sounds like it is going to be fast. Man, 
that sounds good. Executive order; let’s 
move fast. In actuality, it would throw 
the States in chaos. It would be tied up 
in the courts. It would slow everything 
down, just like each of the Senate Re-
publican legislative proposals so far. 
For example, they all still try to drive 
the idea of wage replacement. We have 
seen problems with getting the amount 
out initially, the $600. Wait until you 
see what happens with the Republican 
wage proposals. 
There is a path here, and that is to 
negotiate in good faith. My Republican 
colleagues have been stalling on nego-
tiating in good faith because they 
thought somehow—and I find this a 
real head-scratcher—they could win a 
war of words by insulting the American 
worker and claiming that they are 
kind of lazy, that they don’t want to 
work and the like. 
I will tell you, on the Finance Com-
mittee, I hear continually from my 
friend from Ohio who talks about the 
superior work ethic of Ohioans. Now he 
is out here talking about how every-
body is not willing to work and unem-
ployment benefits are causing folks to 
stay home rather than work because 
they are too generous. I think that is 
just a bunch of hogwash. I believe 
Americans believe deeply in the dig-
nity of work. 
We just had a nationwide townhall 
meeting 
about 
the 
unemployment 
issue, and people were saying: I can’t 
believe they are calling us lazy and 
saying we don’t want to work. I get a 
job offer on Monday night, and I will be 
up there at the crack of dawn on Tues-
day. 
That is what workers are saying. So 
this idea that they are staying home 
because they don’t want to work—be-
sides, it is a violation of the rules of 
the program as well—I think is just 
hogwash. 
I would also like to put into the 
RECORD right now the latest assess-
ment from the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics about what is really going on out 
here, because the issue is not workers 
being lazy; the issue is scarcity of jobs. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics—again, 
not a political operation—has reported 
that there are four unemployed Ameri-
cans for every job out there. Let me re-
peat that. Not politicians. Not anec-
dotes. Not somebody who said some-
thing to somebody else. Those are the 
facts, colleagues. The Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reported that there are four 
unemployed Americans for every job 
out there. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics analysis showing the 
paucity of jobs. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Mr. WYDEN. I will just say that I am 
stunned that colleagues are saying 
that American workers are out trying 
to scam the system and really don’t 
want to work and all of these things 
that I think suggest a very different 
picture than what I hear from workers 
and, by the way, what I hear from my 
friend from Ohio when he is in the Fi-
nance Committee. 
I have a final point. The Republicans 
knew the cliff was coming in May when 
the House passed the Heroes Act. They 
knew the cliff was coming in June. I 
am just going to walk this through be-
cause I heard: Oh my goodness, all of 
the Democrats are involved in pushing 
workers off the cliff. 
The Republicans knew the cliff was 
coming in May. That is when the House 
passed their bill. They knew the cliff 
was coming a few weeks after that 
when Senator SCHUMER and I intro-
duced and tried to get passed a piece of 
legislation that was really based, I say 
to my friend from Ohio—and something 
I heard our friend from South Dakota, 
Senator THUNE, talk about—Senator 
THUNE said: You know, I get it. When 
folks are hurting, the benefits have to 
be used to pay the rent and buy gro-
ceries. But when unemployment goes 
down, the benefit should taper down. 
That is essentially what the Demo-
cratic leader, Senator SCHUMER, and I 
offered—to tie unemployment insur-
ance to the realities of what is on the 
ground in the American economy. 
Republicans knew the cliff was com-
ing in May. They knew a few weeks 
later that Senator SCHUMER and I tried 
to actually pass a bill that, as I devel-
oped it and brought it to our leadership 
and showed it to colleagues, was really 
to a great extent sparked by what our 
friend from South Dakota, a Member of 
the Republican leadership, said: Well, 
let’s kind of recognize that when the 
economy gets better, the benefit tapers 
off. 
Republicans knew the cliff was com-
ing in July when again Leader SCHU-
MER and I tried to provide certainty for 
American families and communities by 
passing our bill. Did they come to the 
table with earnest proposals? 
Senate Republicans have spent the 
week on this idea of a 1-week exten-
sion, which the people who run the pro-
grams—the people who are the most 
knowledgeable, who don’t have elec-
tion certificates, who are experts in the 
field—are saying would not deliver to 
the people who are desperate to buy 
groceries and pay rent. It would not de-
liver the funds they so desperately 
need for quite some time. 
These proposals are not serious. They 
are political theater. 
The cliff is here. As Americans fami-
lies fall over it, I am just stunned that 
we are hearing Republicans say: You 
know, it is OK to offer these proposals. 
I have seen a number in elevators, 
leaving town. I am going to be here. I 
am going to be here because I think 
when workers are hurting and they 
can’t make rent and they can’t pay 
groceries, you stay at it. 
The Senator from Ohio knows that is 
how we got to $600, because when Sec-
retary Scalia folded his arms and said 
he couldn’t really do anything that 
would present a real benefit, we spent 3 
days—3 long days—and we said on our 
side: You are not going to stiff the 
workers, and we will just average the 
benefit. Some would get more, some 
would get less, but we would give ev-
erybody in America who, through no 
fault of their own, has been laid off a 
chance to pay the rent, buy groceries, 
and at the same time keep the econ-
omy afloat. 
For all of those reasons, and espe-
cially reflecting my disappointment 
that after—and I just walked every-
body through it—one effort to go and 
negotiate; a couple of weeks later, an-
other effort; then in July, another ef-
fort. But nothing happened. In fact, I 
stood right where I am, as benefits 
were about to expire, and I said: How 
can the Republican leader basically say 
we are going home? When they asked 
him about moving anything to really 
meet the needs of the workers, the 
press reported—everybody was quoting 
the press—that the Republican leader 
laughed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, excuse 
me. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I was hoping after all 
that there wouldn’t be an objection be-
cause I can’t believe that my friend

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5249 
August 6, 2020 
from Oregon believes that it is not a 
good idea to do an extension. All we 
are talking about is an extension for a 
week of the $600, the full amount, even 
though, again, all the data out there 
shows that amount is not practical for 
our economy, for workers, or for busi-
nesses. 
He made a valiant effort trying to ex-
plain why he is not for that, but I know 
that people who are watching just 
think it is common sense. Let’s con-
tinue to discuss, but let’s be sure we 
have, as my colleague from Alaska 
said, good-faith negotiations. That is 
not good faith, to say $600 or nothing. 
And that is exactly what the nego-
tiators have said. 
To my colleague from Oregon, I wish 
they would authorize you to negotiate. 
I think you and I could actually work 
out something, and I think you prob-
ably do too. But they have not author-
ized us, and the Democratic nego-
tiators have said $600 or nothing. 
This notion that the 1-week exten-
sion just doesn’t work—absolutely it 
works. Are you telling me that the 
State unemployment offices would not 
provide the $600? Of course they would. 
There would be a lapse, of course. 
There would be a week or two, they 
say. But that $600 would be in people’s 
pockets. 
By the way, there is a lapse right 
now, so people who lost their unem-
ployment last Friday in some States, 
including Ohio, continue to get it be-
cause there is a lapse in the payment. 
So, yes, people would get the money. Of 
course they would get it. And they 
would be able to plan on it and have 
some certainty. 
Frankly, if it hadn’t been blocked 
last week when Senator MCSALLY 
stood right over here and offered it, it 
would be even sooner that people would 
get it. I say it is 1 to 2 weeks, so for 
some people, they would be getting it 
right now. 
It is absolutely essential for us to fig-
ure out how to find a way forward here. 
It is not, to me, an option for us to do 
nothing. We can’t allow this cliff to 
continue. But in the meantime, all we 
are saying is, let’s just have a little 
time to work it out, and hopefully the 
Democrats will get off of their $600 and 
realize that is not a path forward be-
cause it doesn’t work. 
You are right. When we put the $600 
in place, our thought was that would be 
about average. In other words, it would 
be the average wage replacement, so 
that you would have half the people 
making a little more and half the peo-
ple making a little less. That is not 
how it worked out. 
Again, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice—nonpartisan CBO—says that more 
than 80 percent of the UI recipients are 
going to make more on unemployment 
than they would at their old jobs, if 
you follow the Democratic proposal. In 
Chicago, 68 percent, but that is not 
what we intended. Certainly, we should 
be able to adjust here, and we should be 
able to get to yes. 
My deep concern is that the nego-
tiators are so intransigent on the 
Democratic side that we will end up 
hurting the very people Democrats are 
talking about helping. 
Let’s come up with a sensible solu-
tion. I think there is a path here, and 
it is to negotiate in good faith. I think 
an Executive order isn’t necessary if 
we do our work. I think inaction by not 
negotiating in good faith is the worst 
possible outcome. 
I yield to my colleague from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Thank you, Senator 
PORTMAN. 
I have a lot of respect for my col-
league from Oregon, who unfortunately 
just left the Senate floor, but there 
they go again. On the Senate floor, the 
Senator from Oregon just said ‘‘Repub-
licans cut off unemployment insurance 
for millions of families’’ when, in re-
ality, what we have just witnessed—if 
you are watching—on the Senate floor 
is that the Senator from Oregon ob-
jected to restoring unemployment ben-
efits for millions of Americans. That is 
a fact. That is just what happened. 
So he says one thing—and again, I 
think they get a little bit careless be-
cause they think the national media 
will just report what he says. But he 
said, ‘‘I object.’’ When he said ‘‘I ob-
ject,’’ here is what he meant: I object 
to restoring unemployment benefits for 
millions of Americans. That is what 
the Senator from Oregon just did. 
There is no denying that. And right be-
fore he did it, he said that Republicans 
cut off unemployment for millions of 
Americans. That is just not true—not 
true. 
He just objected to restoring unem-
ployment benefits for a week—$600 for 
millions of Americans—just like the 
Democratic leader from New York did 
last week. Then he said: ‘‘Short-term 
extensions are not enough.’’ That is an-
other quote from the Senator from Or-
egon, but he didn’t finish the sentence 
by saying: And because I objected, they 
are going to get zero. 
So think about that one. Short-term 
extensions 
are 
not 
enough—sounds 
good—so he objects so there are no ex-
tensions. Again, that is just what hap-
pened on the floor. 
He didn’t say one thing about this 
issue that Senator PORTMAN and I have 
been discussing, which is good-faith ne-
gotiations. There is not one Senator in 
this body who believes that when the 
Democratic leader comes to the floor 
of the Senate and says ‘‘take the $4 
trillion Speaker PELOSI bill passed in 
early May or nothing,’’ that that is 
good faith. It is almost, by definition, 
bad faith. 
So I think our colleagues, who are 
trying to negotiate in good faith but 
are getting locked down by their lead-
ership, are having a bit of a problem 
because they know this isn’t good 
faith, and they know people are suf-
fering. That is why we have got to 
work together to get to an agreement, 
but what we cannot do and what I fear 
the other side is starting to do is use 
people who are suffering as leverage in 
negotiations. That is not what we 
should be doing. We should be working 
in good faith to try to get to an agree-
ment, and we should be making state-
ments on the Senate floor that are ac-
tually factual. 
What just happened here was that 
the Senator from Oregon objected to 
American citizens getting their unem-
ployment benefits restored. That is a 
fact. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before 
they leave the floor, I just want to 
compliment my colleagues from Alas-
ka and Ohio on making a very impor-
tant point. You would think, from the 
press, that there are negotiations tak-
ing place, but the truth is that Speaker 
PELOSI and the minority leader in the 
Senate, Senator SCHUMER, have shown 
zero interest in resolving the dif-
ferences on this next COVID–19 pack-
age. I think it is just very important 
for my colleagues to lay out the facts 
because there is a tendency to ignore 
the facts in favor of a mythical or a 
fantasy construct, so I appreciate their 
statements. 
Hopefully, sometime soon, now that 
the enhanced unemployment benefits 
have been allowed to expire as a result 
of Democratic objections and where the 
Paycheck Protection Program, which 
was the single most successful part of 
the CARES Act legislation that we 
passed, is likewise scheduled to termi-
nate here soon, I hope Democratic ne-
gotiators will get serious about pro-
viding a fifth coronavirus relief pack-
age to support our country through 
this unprecedented crisis. 
We are doing pretty well. During the 
previous 
legislation, 
we 
virtually 
passed these trillion-plus-dollar bills, 
multitrillion-dollar bills, essentially 
by unanimous vote because we knew 
we were in the middle of an emergency. 
We knew that it was not a time for pol-
itics; it was a time to try to help peo-
ple who were out of work or needed 
help from our beleaguered healthcare 
providers. 
So we rose to the occasion, pre-
viously, by bolstering our healthcare 
response, 
making 
testing 
free 
of 
charge, providing vital funding for our 
hospitals, and arming our medical 
workers with the personal protective 
equipment and other medical equip-
ment they needed in order to sustain 
the fight. We have poured funding into 
the research and development of a vac-
cine, therapeutics, and treatments, 
which are coming along, and we are all 
hopeful an American company will win 
the global race for a vaccine in addi-
tion to these therapeutics. 
The legislation we passed so far has 
buoyed the workers and families in 
need of financial assistance with direct 
payments, 
bolstered 
unemployment 
benefits, as well as conferred the abil-
ity to defer student loan payments

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

August 6, 2020 
with no penalty, and we have supported 
our wobbly economy with assistance 
for Main Street businesses through the 
Paycheck Protection Program that I 
mentioned a moment ago and other 
loans for industries that our State and 
counties rely upon, as well as countless 
jobs. 
While Republicans and Democrats 
were negotiating these bills in good 
faith, it was clear we had some dif-
ferent ideas about the best way to sup-
port our country through the crisis, 
but what mattered most was that we 
shared the same goal. At least we did 
then. I am beginning to doubt whether 
we share the same goal now. The goal 
then was to help people in distress, eco-
nomically and from a public health 
standpoint. Now, it seems like Speaker 
PELOSI and the minority leader in the 
Senate are more interested in trying to 
score political points and use people 
who are in distress and anxious and 
fearful as hostages. 
Well, it is really, really unaccept-
able. We should be strengthening our 
fight against the virus and supporting 
those harmed by economic impact and 
laying the foundation for a rebound of 
our economy, which was one of the 
strongest in my lifetime right before 
this pandemic hit. 
Those remain my priorities today, as 
we navigate these uncharted waters 
and prepare to strengthen our fight at 
this crucial time, but the hangup in ne-
gotiations between Democrats and the 
administration seems to indicate that 
our Democratic colleagues have shifted 
course—or 
at 
least 
that 
Speaker 
PELOSI and Minority Leader SCHUMER 
have. 
The majority of information we are 
learning about these negotiations is 
not coming from rank-and-file Mem-
bers but from leaks and press con-
ferences to the media about private 
meetings in Speaker PELOSI’s office. 
From what I understand, it sounds like 
the Speaker and the minority leader 
have simply stiff-armed any offers that 
fall short of their ridiculous Heroes Act 
legislation that the Speaker and the 
House passed on a partisan basis a few 
weeks ago—that they knew at the time 
had no chance of becoming law. 
This legislation was heralded by 
Speaker PELOSI and Minority Leader 
SCHUMER as the solution our country 
needs to defeat this virus, so let’s talk 
about what is in it. For starters, the 
so-called Heroes Act is a massive tax 
cut for millionaires and billionaires. If 
the 
Heroes 
Act 
became 
law, 
the 
wealthiest people in New York and San 
Francisco would receive an average 
benefit of nearly $60,000—$60,000—high-
er than the household income for many 
Texans. 
Well, this has nothing to do with 
COVID–19 or supporting those who are 
struggling to make ends meet. It is a 
handout to the people who need it 
least, at everyone else’s expense. But 
that is only one line in the long list of 
absurdities in this legislation, the He-
roes Act, that have absolutely nothing 
to do with the crisis at hand. 
What is the Speaker’s priority when 
it comes to COVID–19? Well, it is a soil 
health program, environmental justice 
grants, permanent changes in election 
law, and not one but two diversity 
studies in the marijuana industry. 
POLITICO called this bill, at the 
time, a Democratic wish list filled with 
all the party’s favorite policies. NPR, 
hardly a bastion of conservative com-
munication, said it is a long wish list 
for Democrats. The New York Times— 
the New York Times—basically, a 
party organ for the Democrats, said 
the bill was more a messaging docu-
ment than a viable piece of legislation. 
The reason they said that is because 
one-third of that bill is unrelated to 
the coronavirus. 
It paid people more to stay home 
than to work. It sent checks to illegal 
immigrants. It bailed out poorly run 
States. It facilitated ballot harvesting, 
marijuana banking, and, as I said, tax 
breaks for coastal elites. 
That stands in stark contrast to 
what we have proposed and what Lead-
er MCCONNELL
aptly summed up as 
kids, jobs, and healthcare. Those ought 
to be our priorities. As we discover our 
new normal that exists somewhere be-
tween the virus arriving in the United 
States and a vaccine being distributed, 
that is where we need to target our at-
tention and our support. 
That includes funding for educators 
who are in the process of planning the 
safest way to teach students in the fall 
and childcare for working parents who 
are heading back to the office. It in-
cludes helping the workers who had the 
rug pulled out from under them when 
our Democratic colleagues refused to 
continue bolstered unemployment ben-
efits until these workers can get back 
to a steady paycheck. 
Our bill included continued support 
for our war against the virus itself, 
both in hospitals and in research labs. 
These have been the main concerns in 
my recent conversations with my con-
stituents in Texas, especially now that 
the bolstered unemployment benefits 
provided by the CARES Act have ex-
pired. 
Since March, more than 3 million 
Texans have filed for unemployment 
benefits, and recipients have taken ad-
vantage of the additional $600 a week. 
This additional income has helped fam-
ilies cover the rent, groceries, and 
other critical expenses until they are 
able to return to work, and for many 
workers there is still a great deal of 
uncertainty about when that might 
happen. 
Well, it is clear, though, that that 
$600 additional benefit had some unin-
tended 
consequences. 
Frankly, 
we 
should have capped the amount that 
somebody could receive for unemploy-
ment benefits at their previous earning 
level, but, according to the Texas 
Workforce Commission, with the $600 
weekly benefit on top of the State ben-
efit, 80 percent of the people receiving 
the unemployment insurance benefit 
were making more on unemployment 
insurance than they were previously 
employed—80 percent. 
That brings us to a point far beyond 
giving workers the financial support 
they need to stay afloat. Instead, the 
Federal Government is paying people 
not to work. That is the wrong incen-
tive and, certainly, completely unnec-
essary. Payroll, wage substitution— 
yes. Paying people not to work—no. 
A recent poll found that two-thirds of 
Americans believe that these enhanced 
benefits discourage people from going 
back to work, and they are right. 
Among unemployed Americans, nearly 
half say they would avoid returning to 
work if these benefits were extended. 
The businesses in my State which 
closed their doors earlier this year 
have now had trouble hiring employees 
back because some 80 percent of those 
former employees are making more not 
working than they were working. If we 
were to extend that benefit through 
January, as the Heroes Act would, our 
economy would not recover, as we all 
need it to do. 
So there is a delicate balance—but an 
important 
balance—between 
sup-
porting those who need help until they 
can return to the workforce and giving 
them an incentive to avoid returning 
to work. This is not an all-or-nothing 
approach. It is not 600 bucks or bust, 
even though that is the way Speaker 
PELOSI and Minority Leader SCHUMER 
like to put it. 
We can and we should begin and con-
tinue to supplement State unemploy-
ment benefits and give workers the in-
come they need to support their fami-
lies without paying people more to 
stay home than to work. It is not rock-
et science. 
We are all anxiously waiting for the 
Speaker and the minority leader to 
wake up and start focusing on the task 
at hand, which is on commonsense poli-
cies that support our country through 
this crisis. Texans don’t have time to 
wait for the posturing or the poli-
ticking and the grandstanding, not to 
mention the heel-dragging. They don’t 
have an interest in knowing how di-
verse the marijuana business is, and 
they don’t want to provide a massive 
tax break to the richest Americans on 
the east coast at the expense of every-
one else. 
My constituents want to be able to 
feed their families; they want to be 
able to work; they want to be able to 
pay their rent; and they want to know 
their kids will be healthy as the school 
year begins. 
I implore our colleagues, Speaker 
PELOSI, and Minority Leader SCHUMER 
to drop the games, quit hurting people 
you claim to champion, and pay atten-
tion to what America really needs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to thank my good friend and col-
league from Texas for laying out the 
choice before us and highlighting, 
again, this issue of good-faith negotia-
tions, which hopefully we are starting

to see, but last week we didn’t see; and 
he talked about the so-called Heroes 
Act passed in May—so quite stale. 
I will say one other element of that 
that was shocking and has been shock-
ing to me is, there is a whole section 
on clawing back CARES Act money 
that went to Alaska Natives. The He-
roes Act, the Pelosi $4 trillion bill, has 
a section that targets expressly about 
20 percent of the population of my 
State—and my State only. By the way, 
they are amazing, patriotic people who 
have been through pandemics before 
and have suffered horrendously during 
these pandemics. The Heroes Act tar-
gets them and says any money that Na-
tive Alaskan organizations have re-
ceived—by the way, organizations, re-
gional and village corporations set up 
by Congress—any money they have re-
ceived will be clawed back in the He-
roes Act. Of course, I am never going to 
let that bill pass—ever—on this floor. 
It is an outrage. 
They need to get more serious about 
these negotiations, and the ‘‘take it or 
leave it’’ on the $4 trillion Pelosi bill 
that specifically targets some of the 
most patriotic Americans in the coun-
try, who happen to be my constitu-
ents—Alaska Natives—is never going 
to fly. Never. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JULIA BEVINS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday, and it is a time that I get to 
come to the Senate floor and recognize 
an Alaskan who has made a difference 
in my State and, in this case, someone 
who has made a difference literally 
around the globe. This is someone I 
refer to as the ‘‘Alaskan of the Week.’’ 
I love to do it. I know some of our re-
porters listening enjoy this. 
Kristin, I know you love bears, so 
this week you will be particularly in-
terested. 
Before I get into the bears and the 
story and the individual we are going 
to honor today, let me tell you a little 
bit about what is happening in Alaska. 
Like other places in our great Nation, 
our State is certainly facing chal-
lenges—like the rest of America, one 
foot in our economic recovery, one foot 
still in this pandemic. It is a chal-
lenging time, but Alaskans are tough— 
certainly some of the toughest people 
in America. As I say, tough times don’t 
last, but tough people do. We will get 
through this as a State, as a nation, 
and I think that certainly applies to 
Alaska. 
It is summer. The Sun is high. The 
salmon are running thick. The bears 
are digging them out of the streams. 
By the way, a word to the wise: When 
you have salmon, you almost always 
have bears, so be careful. 
In Alaska, we love our bears and so 
does our Alaskan of the Week, Julia 
Bevins, who recently moved from An-
chorage 
to 
the 
gorgeous 
town 
of 
Homer—Homer, AK. For those of you 
who have been there, you know what I 
am talking about. For those who 
haven’t, you have to get out to Homer. 
It is the halibut capital of the world 
but a magnificently beautiful place. 
Just the drive from Anchorage to 
Homer is breathtaking. There is no 
other place in the world like it. 
It is from Homer that Julia keeps 
going the now world-renowned founda-
tion, the international Bear Conserva-
tion Fund, which is part of the Inter-
national Association of Bear Research 
and Management, or IBA, that she and 
her late husband, wildlife biologist 
John Bevins, founded. 
Why the foundation and why the 
bears? Let me tell you about a tragic 
and beautiful story relating to Julia 
and her late husband John. 
Julia was born in New Mexico and 
raised in Australia. She has a degree in 
veterinary science from the University 
of Queensland in Australia. She came 
to Alaska in 1984 to get a Ph.D. in wild-
life biology at the University of Alaska 
Fairbanks. Her focus was on reindeer 
herd health and disease control. 
She met John in 1985, and the two 
were married in Fairbanks in July, 
1990. They were both in love with Alas-
ka and with each other. It was the love 
of a lifetime, Julia said. 
Indeed, it was a great match. She was 
a veterinarian focusing on reindeer. He 
was a wildlife biologist for the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, working on 
polar bear research—the best wildlife 
biologist job you could ever have, polar 
bear research in Alaska. 
Then, unfortunately, tragedy struck. 
Three months after they were married, 
on October 11, John and his colleague 
George 
Menkens, 
and 
their 
pilot, 
Clifford Minch, got into a twin engine 
aero commander at Deadhorse. They 
were headed north to do a low-altitude 
aerial survey of female polar bears 
with cubs who prowl the ice hunting 
for food. 
They were believed to have traveled 
as far as 250 miles northwest of Barrow, 
now known as Utqiaqvik—the north-
ernmost point of North America. That 
is where people believe the plane they 
were traveling on vanished. No one 
really knows where. 
The search, at least initially, was ex-
tensive. In the first few days, members 
of the U.S. Coast Guard flew C–130s, as 
well as civilians in their aircraft, and 
spanned the area, flying hundreds of 
thousands of square miles looking for 
any signs of the aircraft. After a week, 
they decided the search was over. Julia 
was desperate. She knew that her late 
husband and the two others had 2 
weeks of provisions and adequate sur-
vival gear. What if they had survived? 
What if they were on an icefloe? What 
if they were still out there and the 
searchers happened to miss them in 
that huge expanse? 
This idea was overwhelming to her. 
She called everyone she knew to help 
in keeping the search going. And even-
tually, like so many Alaskans did, she 
called the late great Senator Ted Ste-
vens, who—as he was known to do—got 
to work for his fellow Alaskan. 
‘‘He did an amazing thing,’’ Julia 
said. He arranged for the Canadians to 
send a military radar plane that could 
detect metal above sea ice—anything 
bigger than a 4-foot square. The plane 
could cover an area the size of Mani-
toba in 1 night. So they did it. 
It was that search that finally gave 
Julia peace of mind. She said: After the 
military plane came and left, I felt like 
we had done everything we could have 
possibly done to find my husband. I 
knew my husband was gone, and there 
was a peace of mind going forward. 
Senator Ted Stevens gave me a life, 
she said. He gave me a life free from 
self-recrimination and free of doubt. 
She also credits Senator Stevens for 
giving her enough peace to work to 
honor her husband’s memory in a way 
that was unique to him. She took the 
proceeds she received from the insur-
ance, and she began the bear founda-
tion. It started off small in 1993. The 
first year it was up and running, the 
foundation gave away $5,000 in grant 
money. That money, which was in-
vested well, began to grow and so did 
the amount of the grants awarded. 
One year, the foundation was able to 
give out $50,000 in grant money. The 
average size of individual grants is now 
$8,000. All told, they are able to give 
about $100,000 a year, including dona-
tions that they get from individuals 
and organizations. 
It is not just about the money that 
has grown, so has the prestige of this 
foundation. The IBA now has 550 mem-
bers from over 60 countries. Because of 
Julia Bevins, in Homer, AK, all across 
the globe, researchers are working with 
other biologists. They are tracking 
bears. They are assisting in manage-
ment of these great animals. They are 
writing papers and sharing informa-
tion. They are doing what they love for 
the ecosystem. Julia said: 
When people love bears, they love them 
with their whole heart and soul. It’s a very 
profound thing. 
Julia talked about how the IBA fund-
ed a researcher to search for a rumored 
small brown bear—the Gobi bear—in 
Mongolia, the only bear to exist in this 
extreme desert habitat. There had been 
sightings throughout the year, but no 
scientist had ever been able to prove 
its existence. 
The IBA funded a scientist, Harry 
Reynolds—an Alaska from Fairbanks— 
to travel through Mongolia and find 
the Gobi bear. And he found them. Now 
the Mongolian Government is com-
mitted to its protection. 
Scientists funded by the IBA worked 
with other scientists in Iran to docu-
ment not only bears, but they were 
able to find 16 new wildlife species. 
From the dangerous border between 
India and Pakistan to the equally dan-
gerous forests of Colombia, bear re-
searchers, helped with IBA money, are 
working with local citizens and govern-
ments and other scientists, forming 
true alliances to help save bears. 
Science ties the world together, Julia 
said. When you have a collective of

like-minded people working for a com-
mon goal, all things are possible. 
When you have someone with a mis-
sion like Julia Bevins, all things are 
possible too. 
Thank you to Julia for your commit-
ment to this great cause, for your work 
in helping keep John’s memory alive, 
and for your amazing work on bears in 
Alaska and bears in the world. Con-
gratulations on being our Alaskan of 
the Week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday afternoon, and it looks like 
any other Thursday afternoon. There is 
no sense of urgency. The leader, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, has sent folks on 
their way for the weekend, and there is 
no agreement on the COVID–19 survival 
package, which is what it really is for 
so many families. 
We are in a situation where it is an-
other week of not focusing on how we 
get unemployment extension passed or 
how we deal with hungry families or 
make sure people are going to have a 
roof over their head or support our 
small businesses or our small family 
farms or our first responders on the 
frontlines and others in cities and 
towns and in States who are providing 
public services essential to us—people 
who are in jobs who may lose their jobs 
if we can’t get them the support they 
need. 
That is not happening. There are a 
few nominations—a couple of nomina-
tions of judges. Let’s put a few more 
ideologically 
extreme, 
rightwing 
judges on the bench. No sense of ur-
gency. We are here on a Thursday as if 
it were just regular business. 
Over 2 months ago, Senator MCCON-
NELL said he felt no sense of urgency to 
act on what the House passed, no sense 
of urgency at all. Over 21⁄2 months ago, 
the House of Representatives passed a 
critical survival package to continue 
to tackle the pandemic, including test-
ing, 
supporting 
our 
hospitals 
and 
nurses and doctors and communities on 
the frontline who are trying to main-
tain, manage, and keep us safe—save 
lives. 
Senator MCCONNELL said he felt no 
sense of urgency. He certainly has dem-
onstrated no sense of urgency since 
that time. He is not even in the nego-
tiations that are going on right now. 
But this isn’t a regular Thursday for 
folks in Michigan. No. This isn’t a reg-
ular Thursday, like ‘‘Ho-hum, let’s go 
home for the weekend or longer.’’ We 
have 1.8 million people on unemploy-
ment benefits. By the way, we don’t 
have 1.8 million jobs right now that 
they could get. These aren’t folks who 
just don’t want to work. The jobs 
aren’t there because of what has hap-
pened with the pandemic and the nec-
essary closures and the challenges 
going on for businesses large and small. 
We certainly want to support them 
to safely be able to reopen, but we have 
1.8 million people who, this week—this 
Friday, as opposed to last Friday—this 
Friday, tomorrow, when they get help 
through unemployment, it is going to 
be about a 60-percent cut—6–0, not 6—a 
60-percent cut. Their rent didn’t go 
down 60 percent. Their food didn’t go 
down 60 percent. Their utility bills 
didn’t go down 60 percent. The other 
things they need to take care of their 
families didn’t go down 60 percent. But 
their income is going down 60 percent 
because there is no sense of urgency in 
this Senate. 
The Republican majority sees no 
sense of urgency. It is just another 
Thursday afternoon. There is no sense 
of urgency to help people who are try-
ing to figure out what to do right now 
because everything collapsed when the 
pandemic hit and their business closed 
or other challenges took over so they 
are not able to work right now. What 
are they going to do? It is not just an-
other Thursday afternoon for them. 
It is not just another Thursday after-
noon for the single mom of two kids in 
Michigan right now who, frankly, could 
very well be deciding whether she eats 
tonight because it is so important that 
the children eat. She can’t do both, so 
she will go hungry one more time so 
the kids can eat. We have a hunger 
emergency in this country right now. 
It is not just another Thursday for 
those folks, although they have spent 
too many Thursdays feeling hungry. 
It is not just a Thursday for the per-
son who, right now, is probably in their 
car—maybe they have been there 2, 3, 4 
hours—waiting in the food bank line to 
get some groceries to take home. They 
used to donate to the food bank, and 
now they are in a situation in which 
they have to go to the food bank. They 
never thought in their wildest dreams 
that would happen, yet it has. They 
feel a sense of urgency. 
It is not just another Thursday after-
noon in the Senate for them. They feel 
a sense of urgency for today and to-
morrow and Saturday and Sunday and 
Monday and on into however long it is 
going to take to be able to bring our 
colleagues together. 
It would be humorous if it just 
weren’t so outrageous to hear col-
leagues talk about how we need to get 
something done when the House of 
Representatives passed a bill 21⁄2 month 
ago, the Heroes Act. It came over here 
and has just been gathering dust on 
Senator MCCONNELL’s desk. 
We know that negotiation takes 
time. We know you always have to 
compromise, and that should have 
started 2 months ago or a month ago, 
not after somebody is losing 60 percent 
of their income trying to hold it to-
gether for their family. 
By the way, we tell people to go 
home—shelter at home—but their rent-
al protections go away, their mortgage 
protections go away, and you put more 
people on the street. That makes a lot 
of sense in the middle of a health pan-
demic when we want people to stay 
home. 
Every move that has happened in 
this Senate since the House acted has 
been too little too late, and it is caus-
ing more and more devastating con-
sequences as a result of that. 
I will tell you who doesn’t think it is 
another 
Thursday, 
just 
a 
normal 
Thursday afternoon, is 85-year-old re-
tirees I know who are trying to figure 
out how to get their medicine versus 
their groceries. By the way, they 
haven’t been out of their house in over 
4 months. They are trying to stay con-
nected with their families but are ter-
rified of what is happening. Will what 
is happening right now be the rest of 
their life? They certainly feel a sense 
of urgency for us to act. 
The moms and dads who want their 
kids to go back to school safely and are 
trying to figure it out are saying: Come 
on. This cannot be my child’s edu-
cation versus their safety. It has to be 
both. 
That is not exactly rocket science. It 
has to be both. 
I am excited about the Tigers playing 
now—and their baseball league—and I 
am excited about the NFL. But if those 
guys can get tested every day, why 
can’t our teachers? Where are the pri-
orities here? Do they feel a sense of ur-
gency? 
I can tell you that my son and daugh-
ter 
and 
their 
families 
and 
my 
grandkids feel an incredible sense of 
urgency. They want to go back to 
school to see their friends. They want 
to do it safely. They know it has to be 
safe. It is not either-or. They feel a 
sense of urgency. They would love this 
to be just another Thursday afternoon 
when we end the week and everybody 
goes home. It is not that for them as 
they are trying to figure out where 
they go for childcare or their school. 
It certainly isn’t just another regular 
day for the teachers trying to figure 
out what to do. They went into teach-
ing because they love children. They 
want to teach. They also know they 
may have their own preexisting condi-
tions. They also have their own chil-
dren at home. They have to think 
about their own exposure and how they 
can be teaching, which they want to 
do, but it has to be done safely because 
of all the other issues in their lives as 
well. 
I think about the small business 
owner. We have so many in Michigan. 
We have the most incredible entre-
preneurs in Michigan in every small 
town as well as in big cities. There are 
people who poured their hearts and 
souls and capital and second mortgage 
on the house and maxed out their cred-
it cards to have the small business 
they wanted. They are certainly not 
happy it is just another Thursday 
afternoon ending the week in the Sen-
ate. They are desperate to know how to 
keep their doors open and the three 
employees on the payroll. We have 
done some good work in a bipartisan 
way on that, which needs to continue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5253 
August 6, 2020 
Yet that small business person and the 
people I talk to in Michigan feel an in-
credible sense of urgency. 
I talk to our family farmers who 
work night and day, battling the 
weather and low prices and chaotic 
trade policies. I have talked to some-
one raising livestock who can’t find a 
processor that they need right now to 
make the food for hungry families. 
They certainly feel a tremendous sense 
of urgency. 
The reality is that there are millions 
of people across this country who don’t 
understand what is not happening 
here—why there is no sense of urgency, 
why there hasn’t been a willingness to 
come together. Why didn’t it happen 
21⁄2 months ago? What is going on? It 
appears that too many people don’t 
care. 
This is the United States of America. 
We are one of the wealthiest nations in 
the world. We invented the assembly 
line. We put our footprints on the 
Moon. We are seeing what is happening 
today. We should never have gotten to 
this point right now where people are 
losing 60 percent of their income on un-
employment benefits, are hungry try-
ing to feed their kids, worried about 
losing the roof over their head or their 
small business or the family farm. We 
should never have gotten to this point, 
but here we are. 
It has been more than 80 days since 
the House passed the Heroes Act—more 
than 80 days. Since that time, our es-
sential workers, who deserve hazard 
pay, have been waiting. Those pro-
viding public services in our cities and 
towns and in States have been waiting 
for the support they need so that they 
don’t lose their job and we don’t lose 
those public services. Our businesses, 
our schools, our farmers all have been 
waiting, waiting, waiting. The reality 
is it is because it is just another Thurs-
day—just another Thursday afternoon 
in the U.S. Senate. 
Senator MCCONNELL has made it very 
clear that they are just going to have 
to wait some more. Right now, we 
should be voting on an important sur-
vival package for people in our coun-
try. We should be investing whatever it 
takes to manage and get our arms 
around this virus, do the testing, pro-
vide the healthcare, remain laser fo-
cused 
on 
getting 
vaccines. 
People 
should have confidence that everything 
humanly possible is being done and 
that there is a sense of urgency here. 
I feel a sense of urgency. My Demo-
cratic colleagues feel the sense of ur-
gency. Through the actions on this 
floor, we do not see that the Senate Re-
publican majority feels the sense of ur-
gency that every single person in 
Michigan feels right now. 
We need to take action. People are 
tired of waiting. They can’t afford to 
wait any longer. This is about their 
lives and their livelihoods. People need 
help. The Congress, working with the 
President, needs to provide that help, 
and there is no excuse not to act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
here we are—another Thursday after-
noon in the Senate. It is pretty quiet 
around here. It is amazing how quickly 
this place gets quiet when the Senate 
majority leader, the Republican leader, 
Senator MCCONNELL, tells people: We 
don’t have any more work to do today. 
By the way, we don’t have any more 
work to do tomorrow, Friday. By the 
way, don’t worry about Saturday or 
Sunday. Monday, you know, I will be 
here, says the Majority leader, but the 
Senate doesn’t need to be here doing 
its 
work—maybe 
not 
Tuesday 
or 
Wednesday either. 
I want to thank the Senator from 
Michigan, Ms. STABENOW, for being 
down here, standing up for working 
men and women and families and small 
businesses because, for them, it is not 
business as usual. It is not business as 
usual for all the folks who are out of 
work. 
Thirty million Americans are on un-
employment insurance, but here in the 
Senate, for the Senate majority leader, 
it is business as usual. Take a day off. 
Take the weekend off. Be on standby 
next week. Maybe we will start doing 
something real. 
I can tell you the coronavirus is not 
on standby. The coronavirus is not tak-
ing a day off or 2 days off. It is con-
tinuing to spread in many parts of the 
country. We don’t have enough testing 
equipment. We are not able to test peo-
ple quickly. It takes people days and 
days and days and, in some cases, 
weeks to get their results. 
We hear the President of the United 
States saying he wants to open up the 
economy and open up schools. We all 
want to open up the economy. We all 
want our children back in school, for 
classrooms are the best place for learn-
ing. But do you know what? You can’t 
just wish for that to happen, just like 
you can’t wish for the coronavirus to 
go away, and that makes it go away. 
You need to do real work. You need the 
testing equipment so that we can test 
people in realtime and make sure that 
we prevent further outbreaks. We don’t 
want bonfires to turn into brush fires 
to turn into prairie fires. You need to 
catch the virus and contain it. You 
can’t do that if you don’t have testing 
equipment. 
So the virus is not taking a day off or 
2 or 3 or a week, and we shouldn’t ei-
ther. This Senate needs to do its job. 
We are in the middle of a pandemic. 
This is not a normal August. This 
should not be business as usual, and as 
Senator STABENOW said, we should not 
be here, at this moment, with impor-
tant protections having already ex-
pired. This Senate sat by and did noth-
ing while the protections against evic-
tions expired. The eviction moratorium 
that was protecting millions of Ameri-
cans—gone. The extra $600 a week in 
unemployment—gone. Yet here we are 
with the majority leader saying: Take 
Friday off. Take Saturday off. Business 
as usual. 
Well, that is a difficult thing to tell 
families and workers and small busi-
nesses around the country, and it can-
not be business as usual. 
The House of Representatives passed 
the Heroes Act more than 21⁄2 months 
ago. It realized that after we passed the 
CARES Act in a bipartisan way, impor-
tant protections were going to expire, 
and it acted. The House made sure it 
passed legislation to extend the en-
hanced unemployment of $600 a week. 
It passed legislation to extend the evic-
tion moratorium. It provided addi-
tional food assistance for our kids. It 
provided important funds for rental as-
sistance, which not only helps tenants 
stay in their apartments and homes 
but provides the payments to the land-
lords so the landlords can make the 
payments to the people they owe 
money to and on up the economic food 
chain. 
The House did all of that, and what 
did the Senate do for 21⁄2 months? Noth-
ing. Nothing. It is like a train is head-
ing right for you, and you stand in the 
middle of the tracks until it hits you 
when any commonsense person would 
do what the House of Representatives 
did, which was to take action to make 
sure that we didn’t cross these dead-
lines and cause unnecessary harm to 
millions of American families, work-
ers, and small businesses. That is what 
the Senate has done. 
Now, even after we are into those 
deadlines—we have crossed those dead-
lines—what does the majority leader 
here, the Republican leader, say? Take 
tomorrow off. Take the weekend off. 
Take Monday off. In fact, the Senate 
may not come in for a while. I mean, 
we will come in, but there will be no 
voting, no real business. 
Let me tell you what I am hearing 
from my constituents, because I know 
it is not different from what other 
Members are hearing from theirs. Here 
is a letter I received from a single 
mom. 
I live . . . with my 15-year-old son as a sin-
gle mother. I am asking for your help in vot-
ing to extend the $600 Federal unemployment 
benefit. I understand a lot of politicians do 
not want this extended due to the thought 
that the benefit is too great and will prevent 
Marylanders from wanting to return back to 
work, in that they make more money from 
staying at home off of the State/government 
this way. Now, we all know, if your job calls 
you back during this time and you choose 
not to return, your benefits are going to be 
cut off anyway. 
As for me, I am losing thousands of dollars 
each month being out of work and am barely 
scraping by as it is now with the extra $600. 
I desperately WANT TO RETURN to work 
and make my regular salary, which is more. 
I am very thankful for the extra $600 a week 
and have no idea how I would have survived 
without it during this time. I have zero other 
means to any money or credit. I have been 
able to pay my rent, feed my son, and pay 
some bills. I have deferred my car payment 
until August and am behind on car insur-
ance. I am desperately asking for your help

and the help of the government to extend 
this extra $600 a week benefit for a little 
while longer. Not to sound ungrateful, but an 
extra $100 or $200 per week is just not enough 
to help pay rent and other bills. Cutting this 
benefit abruptly will cause such economic 
hardship and devastation to so many Ameri-
cans. 
This is a single mother, with a 15- 
year-old son, who is pleading with the 
U.S. Senate to do its job. And what 
does the majority leader say to Sen-
ators? Take tomorrow off. Take Satur-
day off. Take Sunday off. Take Monday 
off. 
I want to read another letter I re-
ceived on this subject. Here is what my 
constituent wrote: 
I am emailing in hopes of asking for your 
support to extend the $600 Federal assistance 
in addition to unemployment. While I realize 
that the country has to spend more and more 
during this pandemic, many of us are learn-
ing our temporary layoffs are now perma-
nent (I received the call yesterday) and our 
industries are still completely shut down. I 
have always worked in the hotel industry 
and have no further education or experience 
than that. The hospitality industry is the 
hardest hit during this pandemic. While I 
search multiple times a day for jobs, they 
simply are not open because the industry has 
not yet recovered. In fact, our industry is 
downsizing immensely. 
I am a single mother to one 5-year-old boy 
who will start kindergarten in the fall. We 
do not receive any financial assistance 
through the State, such as housing assist-
ance or child support. Maryland unemploy-
ment of $430 per week will not even cover the 
rent costs, and we will quickly be evicted 
with no options for housing. 
I am not looking to make more money 
than I was at my job. That is not possible. I 
grossed $75,000 in 2019, but I am looking to be 
able to pay my rent and bills and part-time 
childcare because it is in the best interest of 
my son to have social interaction and edu-
cation during the pandemic even if I am not 
working. Please—I beg you—please support 
the extension of the $600 per week benefit. 
Now, I have heard a lot of Senators 
on this floor over weeks and months 
talk about how we just cannot extend 
$600 a week. Yet we hear from these 
moms and parents who are pleading for 
that help so that they can simply pay 
their bills and get by. Even with that, 
they are not able to pay all of their 
bills. 
The Republican leader says to the 
U.S. Senate: Take a day off. Take 2 
days off. Next week, I will be in, says 
the majority leader, but I don’t need 
for the Senate to be in, doing its work. 
What are we all here for? We should 
be here 24/7, working around the clock 
together to resolve these issues. 
We have a lot of multi, multi, multi-
millionaires in this U.S. Senate, and it 
is really rich for all of us to be telling 
families out there that the extra $600 
per week is too much. That is just too 
much. 
These are individuals who want to go 
back to work. I just read to you a let-
ter from someone who works in the 
hospitality industry. That is her expe-
rience. That is what she knows. 
I don’t know if our Republican col-
leagues have checked recently, but the 
unemployment rate is around 15 per-
cent. There are a lot of people out 
there who are looking for work who 
can’t find it. They can’t find it because 
we are in the middle of a pandemic, and 
that has caused a lot of small busi-
nesses and others to shut down in order 
to make sure that we stop the spread of 
the virus. 
These are people who want to get 
back to work. They want nothing bet-
ter than that. They want their children 
back in school. All of us do. Yet we 
have a failed, botched Federal re-
sponse, 
starting 
with 
the 
White 
House—starting with the President, 
who has made this a political issue 
when it has to be a health issue. It has 
made the problem a lot worse, and we 
all know it. We all know that this pan-
demic is lasting longer in the United 
States and has killed more people in 
the United States because of a totally 
failed response right from the top, and 
we should not be complicit in that. We 
should do our job. 
We have the majority leader, the Re-
publican leader. What is he saying? He 
is not even part of the negotiations, 
right? He says: You know, I am in my 
Republican caucus lunches, and, re-
portedly, only half of the Republican 
Senators want to do anything. 
I don’t know if that is true or not, 
but that is what Republican Senators 
are saying on national television. That 
is what we are hearing from the Repub-
lican caucus. So, if that is not true, it 
would be great to hear all of the Re-
publican Senators come down to the 
floor and talk about what they are 
willing to do, not what they are not 
willing to do. Because there are not the 
votes there, the majority leader has 
contracted out his negotiation author-
ity to the White House, and he has told 
the Senate to go home. 
Let’s just start doing our job here in 
the U.S. Senate. Nobody should be con-
tracting out his job and his vote and 
his negotiating authority to the White 
House. This is the U.S. Senate. I don’t 
know what people ran for if they just 
want to say: Oh, I can’t deal with this 
because my caucus doesn’t support any 
response. Go talk to the White House. 
In the meantime in the Senate, take 
Friday off. Take Saturday off. Take 
Sunday off. Maybe take Monday, Tues-
day, and Wednesday off, too. 
That is a hell of a message to send to 
the American people in the middle of a 
pandemic during which so many people 
are hurting. 
I will end with this. Instead of the 
majority leader’s coming down to the 
floor today and telling everybody to go 
away, we should stay here. We should 
stay here, and we should do our job. 
Doing our job means coming together 
with the next round of emergency leg-
islation to slow down and then stop the 
spread of the virus and help the mil-
lions of Americans who are in tremen-
dous economic pain right now. This is 
not business as usual. The Senate 
needs to do its job. Let’s stay here and 
get it done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to 
join my colleagues this afternoon in 
asking: Is this just another Thursday— 
is this just another afternoon in a 
week, in an average year, or in an aver-
age August—when it is fine for all of us 
to simply head to our other commit-
ments and concerns? 
Sometimes here in Washington it is 
awfully easy to feel and be discon-
nected—disconnected from the daily 
concerns and grinding anxiety of the 
pressing issues that make the lives of 
the folks we represent so different. 
I want to start by reminding us of 
something a Senator—a Senator from 
Minnesota—once said in the 1970s. It 
was Hubert Humphrey who said: The 
moral character of a society can best 
be gauged by how they treat those at 
the dawn of life, its children; those in 
the shadows of life, the disabled, the 
disadvantaged; and those in the twi-
light of life, senior citizens. 
Well, if that were the measure of this 
place in this day and this time, then we 
are failing. 
I think every person here, every per-
son listening or watching knows that 
we are in the midst of three crises at 
the same time: a global pandemic, the 
COVID–19 pandemic, in which a highly 
transmissive disease has spread rapidly 
across the world. Many other nations 
have gotten ahead of it, have managed 
it, have stabilized it, but here in the 
United States, we have failed to get 
our arms around it, to stop it, and to 
deliver the coordinated resources and 
supplies needed to give some con-
fidence, some positive direction in our 
public health infrastructure; in our 
schools, in our senior skilled nursing 
centers; in our communities. It has 
gotten away from us. 
More than 150,000 Americans have 
died so far, and States that thought 
they had it well under control are see-
ing it reemerge, and States that early 
on saw no impact are seeing record 
deaths and infections. 
And coming right on the heels of it, 
a 
recession—a 
recession 
deep 
and 
sharp. In the last quarter, a nearly 40- 
percent drop in our GDP; the sharpest 
since we began recording that. 
And then third, a renewed focus on 
inequality in our country. We have 
seen, because of this pandemic and re-
cession and because of the brutal kill-
ing of George Floyd, a reminder of the 
ways in which we are unequal in our 
access to healthcare, our access to op-
portunity, our access to housing. 
So that is the environment we are in. 
Several months ago, we all came to 
this floor and unanimously voted— 
unanimously, in this bitter and divided 
partisan time, we unanimously voted 
to deliver $2.3 trillion in assistance and 
support that sent checks to individual 
Americans and families, that sent 
checks to those who were newly unem-
ployed, that sent support for small

businesses at risk of going under, that 
sent support to State and local govern-
ments, that sent support to hospitals. 
It was the single largest spending bill 
since the Second World War—some re-
minder of just the seriousness, the 
gravity, and the scale of this challenge. 
And 2 months later, the House of 
Representatives took up and passed the 
Heroes Act—another $3 trillion to pro-
vide support across many of those same 
areas. 
And for weeks, this body, the major-
ity, failed to act, to propose an alter-
native, to take it up and examine it, to 
send something back, to put something 
on the table. It was just this Monday, 
the 27th of July, that we got to see the 
answer, and that answer fails to meet 
this moment. 
I am from a small State, the State of 
Delaware—a State below a million peo-
ple. Our Department of Labor, since 
March, has received over 130,000 claims 
for unemployment in a State of less 
than 1 million. More than 1 in 10 Dela-
wareans have filed for unemployment 
assistance. 
We have had huge challenges deliv-
ering all over our country the assist-
ance we voted on months ago. Out of 
that 130,000, 27,000 of them are still 
waiting to get their unemployment 
checks. 
My office and other offices in our del-
egation are helping hundreds of indi-
viduals and families who have called, 
who have emailed, who have texted, 
and who have reached out for help. And 
yet, this body, through inaction, al-
lowed the additional $600 a week in un-
employment insurance that has sus-
tained so many families to expire be-
cause we can’t work out a simple 
agreement on how severe this moment 
is, on how deep the need is, and on 
what the right path forward is. 
When I talk to my Governor, my 
mayor, my county executive in my 
home State, in my city, my county, 
one of their biggest needs is for addi-
tional support for State and local gov-
ernments. 
There is robust support in the Heroes 
Act sent over by the House—$875 bil-
lion. That is a lot of money. There is 
nothing in the HEALS Act presented 
this Monday. And why? So far, 1.5 mil-
lion public employees, public serv-
ants—State, county, local employees— 
have been laid off. And some folks I 
hear on television talking about this 
speak as if they are faceless bureau-
crats in gray buildings. 
But they are teachers; they are para-
medics; they are nurses in county hos-
pitals; they are the folks who admin-
ister these unemployment claims. They 
are the folks who help support small 
businesses. They are the folks who help 
make sure our water is drinkable, that 
our parks are mowed, that our libraries 
are functional, and that our schools 
can open safely. 
This moment is the tale of two 
worlds—a world in the House of Rep-
resentatives that says we are in a crisis 
and an emergency, and when the Amer-
ican people see a challenge this big, 
this deep, they often look to our Fed-
eral Government for the resources that 
will make it possible for their States 
and their counties and their commu-
nities, for their hospital, for their 
school to get through. 
And here there has been a resounding 
silence for weeks. 
I hear week in and week out from 
parents, from teachers, from para-
professionals, anxious: How are our 
schools going to reopen? What is the 
plan? Where are the resources? What 
are the details? How do we get testing? 
How do we get personal equipment— 
personal protective equipment? 
Even now there are conversations ur-
gently going on in my home State 
about how and when and where we will 
be able to reopen. 
When it comes to childcare, millions 
of Americans are unable to return to 
work because there isn’t support for 
childcare. 
And when it comes to small busi-
nesses, thousands have closed their 
doors; thousands more are at risk. 
We will not get through this unless 
we can pull together and deliver a sus-
tained and meaningful response. 
So to my colleagues and friends, I 
don’t know where the rest of our col-
leagues are. I don’t know what they are 
hearing, but I know what I am hearing 
from my constituents in Delaware. 
The way they make sure that we 
don’t get disconnected from our home 
when we are here in Washington, boy, 
they text; they email; they call; they 
post on social media. Some even still 
write good old-fashioned letters. 
And the thousands of letters and 
emails and comments that I got in the 
first few weeks of this pandemic and 
recession 
motivated 
me—motivated 
this entire body—to vote unanimously 
on the CARES Act, one of the biggest 
moments of Federal assistance in our 
Nation’s history. 
So what is going on now? Why the 
lack of focus? Why the sense this is 
just another Thursday afternoon? 
Well, let me read to you for a few 
minutes from a few of the folks who 
have reached out to me from my home 
State. 
Christine in Wilmington lost her job, 
now, months ago. She is a single moth-
er. She is raising a 12-year-old son. She 
got just one unemployment insurance 
check. She has been barely hanging on, 
and ultimately had to sell her car to 
buy groceries. She sent me a message, 
painful in its focus on the urgency of 
there being an additional $600 in Fed-
eral aid. 
She has no job prospects in sight. 
The $1,200 stimulus check that came 
from the CARES Act months ago and 
that 
one 
unemployment 
insurance 
check so far has been critical to keep-
ing food on the table and the lights on 
and a roof over their head for her son. 
She is just one of millions of Ameri-
cans right now—right now, wondering 
what it is going to take to get this 
body to put down the tools of partisan-
ship and work together. 
Some folks say: Well, why don’t you 
just go back to work? There is a study 
out from the Department of Labor that 
says for every four unemployed Ameri-
cans there is only one job that is even 
posted. 
And there are others who cannot 
work because of their family cir-
cumstances. A husband and wife from 
Millsboro 
who 
are 
senior 
citizens 
reached out to me. The wife wants to 
go back to work. She has an oppor-
tunity to go back to work, but her hus-
band has a serious, chronic condition, a 
lung disease, and she is terrified of 
going back to work, catching COVID, 
and infecting her husband in a way 
that would lead to his death. 
They have also relied on this addi-
tional unemployment, the $600 a week, 
which, if it runs out, they will have to 
make very hard choices. She wants to 
work, but she wants to protect her hus-
band. 
A friend of mine, Jeff, runs a small 
candy store on Rehoboth Beach. This 
time of year it would normally be just 
humming with clients and customers, 
folks stopping in for Snyder’s Candy, a 
great small business. Business is down 
50 percent. 
He applied for and he got one of those 
PPP loans in the CARES Act, but he 
received just $9,000—far too little to 
keep everyone on his payroll, to stay 
fully open, and he is waiting, waiting 
to see if we will work together to come 
up with a compromise, with a next 
step, with a next round of loans. 
Another person, a woman Shari, who 
runs a daycare in Wilmington, small 
daycare in her own home. She had six 
families whose children she cared for. 
Even if she is able to reopen fully and 
safely, she has heard from those six 
families. Only two of them are coming 
back. So she is going to have to close 
her business, which means she loses her 
wages, and the families lose childcare. 
She has seen firsthand that parents 
can’t go back to work if they don’t 
have childcare. There is funding for 
childcare in the House bill—so far none 
in the Senate bill. 
And Robert, a man from Newark, DE, 
works in the entertainment industry. 
One of the areas hardest hit is the 
small stages, the entertainment venues 
that are so important to the vibrancy 
of our communities and our culture. 
He has been relying on unemploy-
ment to pay his bills—that extra $600 a 
week. Robert’s message to me: 
When the stimulus runs out, where do I 
turn? Do I have my vehicle repossessed? Do 
I not pay my mortgage or buy food? I have 
worked my entire life and I am ready to get 
back to it as soon as there is clear direction 
for society to follow. Unemployment is not a 
choice—it is an unfortunate byproduct of not 
taking this virus seriously enough in the be-
ginning. 
The publisher of a storied local news-
paper in Sussex County shared with me 
a story that once their PPP funds were 
exhausted, they had to lay off 20 per-
cent of their full-time staff, half of 
their contract employees, and he said:

condition over the next few months certainly

weighs heavy on the Cape Gazette and our 
industry as a whole. The loss of local news 
would be devastating to communities, big 
and small, across the country. 
I can see that I have colleagues eager 
to join me in these remarks on the 
floor, so let me bring this to a close. 
One of the moments this became 
most real for me was when the Dela-
ware Food Bank partnered with the 
Delaware National Guard to provide 
supplemental food for Delawareans. 
I was out at the Christiana Mall, just 
off I–95—huge parking lot. The mall, of 
course, closed. This was early on in the 
pandemic. 
We thought we would see dozens, 
maybe 100 households lined up in their 
cars to get some extra food, much of it 
from Federal sources. 
The line went all the way around the 
mall. Hundreds and hundreds of Dela-
wareans—people who later commented 
either on radio or letters to the editor 
that they never thought they would be 
in a food line. 
Not since the Great Depression have 
the food banks of this Nation seen lines 
as long and made up of as diverse a 
background and groups asking for, 
eager for, willing to accept, hoping for 
support for them and their families. 
This year alone, 50,000 Delawareans 
have turned to our food banks so that 
they can put food on the table for their 
families. 
I don’t know what my colleagues are 
reading, what emails they are getting, 
what calls they are answering, what 
texts or posts on social media are mov-
ing them, but I know that the Dela-
wareans that have reached out to me 
have shared with me the pain of 150,000 
Americans who died, have shared with 
me the anxiety and concern about how 
schools and businesses will reopen, and 
have asked: When will we do our job? 
Work across the aisle, find responsible 
compromise, and support our Nation in 
this moment of crisis. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, since 
the early days of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, it has been clear that we would 
need a sustained response to mitigate 
the damaging health and economic im-
pact facing the American people. 
When Republicans and Democrats 
came together to pass the CARES Act 
in March, I, along with my Democratic 
colleagues, made clear that we would 
need to stand ready to provide addi-
tional, robust support as the situation 
demanded. 
This afternoon we have been hearing 
from our colleagues. I thank Senator 
STABENOW
for gathering us here. I 
thank Senator COONS for the way he 
just illustrated in such personal, direct 
terms the way this pandemic and all of 
its ripple effects are impacting his con-
stituents, as they are impacting my 
constituents and constituents of every 
single Member of the U.S. Senate. 
Unfortunately, the Trump adminis-
tration and Washington Republicans 
have not met the challenges facing the 
American people today with any sense 
of urgency, and the cost of that inac-
tion has been seen all across the coun-
try. But, today, Senate majority Lead-
er MCCONNELL decided to act as if this 
were just any other Thursday—just any 
other Thursday for the Republicans in 
the Senate. 
Well, it is not just any other Thurs-
day for our constituents. Back in May, 
House Democrats passed a substantial 
relief bill called the Heroes Act, but for 
months, Republicans refused to even 
acknowledge the necessity of providing 
more relief. In the 3 months since the 
House acted, the pain that our citizens 
are experiencing has only grown. Cases 
have skyrocketed. The United States of 
America is approaching 160,000 Ameri-
cans killed by this virus. Small busi-
nesses have shuttered, and millions of 
people have lost their jobs. 
Meanwhile, President Trump con-
tinues to downplay the significant toll 
that this virus has taken. Earlier this 
week he said this of the COVID–19 
death toll: ‘‘It is what it is.’’ 
Just yesterday, he again claimed 
that the virus would simply go away. 
Not recognizing the gravity of this 
threat has significantly harmed Ameri-
cans and America. While Congress 
can’t undo the damage that has been 
done, I am urging my colleagues to 
come together on a response that will 
lead us forward. Throughout this week, 
I have joined with my colleagues to 
come to the floor and to lay out some 
of the priorities that we are focused on 
and to share what we are hearing from 
people all across our States. 
The cost of inaction grows every sin-
gle day. Millions of Americans lost en-
hanced unemployment benefits and 
with it the ability to feed their fami-
lies and pay their rent. People will lose 
their homes now to evictions. By the 
way, their landlords will feel the ripple 
effect when they can’t pay their rent. 
Their grocers will feel the ripple effect 
when they can’t buy groceries. The 
economic pain will spread and spread 
and spread. 
Lack of supplies and testing capac-
ity—a national disgrace months into 
this pandemic—is hindering the ability 
to slow the spread of the virus and, of 
course, hindering the ability of people 
to get back to work and school safely. 
Schools are struggling to open with-
out the adequate guidance that the 
Federal Government could provide and 
without resources that they need to 
keep teachers, staff, students, and fam-
ilies safe. 
States and local communities are ac-
celerating cuts and, with it, adding to 
job losses and lost economic activity. 
Americans are hurting. They are 
hurting in red States, and they are 
hurting in blue States. They are crying 
out for help. 
One of the great privileges of this job 
is that people come forward with their 
ideas, with their hopes, with their 
fears. They share incredibly personal 
details about the challenges that they 
face and then are also so willing to 
share with us their successes too. We 
get to witness our constituents and 
work with them in difficult times and 
in good times, and they are willing to 
share that with us. They demonstrate 
to us day in and day out what it means 
to be a member of a community, what 
it means to come together and solve a 
problem. They do it in their businesses. 
They do it on school boards. They do it 
without regard to political party or 
walk of life. 
The least we could do in the U.S. 
Senate on this Thursday, over this 
weekend, over the next week, is follow 
their example, represent them at their 
best, display that American ingenuity, 
innovation, pragmatism, compromise, 
can-do spirit. In the process we could 
save lives; we could begin to rebuild 
our economy; and we could dem-
onstrate to the rest of the world that 
we know how to come together and 
work for what is best for all of us. 
We must help our constituents. We 
must act. Our country cannot wait any 
longer. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator 
STABENOW said some time ago that this 
is not just another Thursday. She and 
my eloquent colleagues, Senator COONS 
and Senator HASSAN, who has just left 
the floor, have shown how painfully 
true Senator STABENOW’s statement is 
about letting this not be just another 
Thursday here in the Senate. 
With Republican colleagues headed 
home for the weekend, perhaps for 
weeks, I want to take stock for a mo-
ment of all of the very crises the coun-
try faces while American families and 
communities don’t have the luxury of a 
weekend. There is the COVID crisis, 
which Senator STABENOW and Senator 
COONS just talked about, with more 
than 50,000 newly confirmed cases and 
1,000 or more deaths a day with a total 
of 41⁄2 million cases in our country to 
date. 
There is the joblessness crisis. En-
hanced unemployment benefits have 
expired. Tens of millions of Americans 
are out of work, with millions walking 
on economic tightropes. 
My colleagues are reading the let-
ters. This is not based on some kinds of 
media reports. They are reading di-
rectly from what their constituents are 
saying, and I want to make sure every-
body knows this, having listened now 
for days to our colleagues saying that 
the big problem is that somehow the 
American 
worker 
doesn’t 
actually 
want to work. Senator STABENOW and I 
have heard that repeatedly in the Fi-
nance Committee room. I think it is in-
sulting to the American worker.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5257 
August 6, 2020 
We had a nationwide townhall spon-
sored by the Town Hall Project on un-
employment issues recently, and peo-
ple would say things such as this: If I 
heard about a job on Monday night, I 
would be there at the crack of dawn on 
Tuesday morning to get that position. 
So, as we take stock of these crises, 
the COVID crisis, the joblessness crisis, 
I think what we ought to do is add the 
crisis of legislative malpractice that 
we are seeing with this Senate Repub-
lican walkout today, heading home in-
stead of working, as Senator COONS has 
said, in a bipartisan way to get the 
coronavirus rescue bill. 
I have not seen anything like this in 
my time in public service: The biggest 
public health disaster in over a cen-
tury, the worst level of unemployment 
since the Depression, an economy that 
barely holds on, and tomorrow’s jobs 
report will almost certainly show that 
any hope for a V-shaped recovery that 
Donald Trump talked about is long 
gone. 
Republicans delayed and sat on their 
hands for months. I think the Pre-
siding Officer heard me walk everybody 
through 
the 
calendar, 
how 
weeks 
passed, months passed. We made offer 
after offer for negotiation. Senator 
SCHUMER and I developed a proposal 
that to a great extent was based on 
some of the thinking of Senator THUNE. 
I always think of my friend from 
Delaware, who is the champion of bi-
partisanship. That proposal was based 
on Senator COON’s—excuse me, Senator 
THUNE’s thought that, you know, if un-
employment is high, people need a ben-
efit so they can make the rent and pay 
for groceries. Then Senator THUNE 
said: But, you know, when unemploy-
ment goes down, the benefits should re-
flect that as well. He said that. 
So Senator SCHUMER and I wrote the 
unemployment insurance bill to reflect 
that. 
The 
unemployment 
benefits 
would be tied to economic conditions 
on the ground. 
Yet what we have seen is that some-
how Senate Republicans can now leave 
in good conscience for the weekend, 
possibly the August recess, when the 
Senate hasn’t passed a bill to help all 
of those Americans who are sick and 
jobless. 
Our job is to legislate on the big 
issues, not to run home and campaign. 
Our job is to sit down, negotiate, and 
find solutions. MITCH MCCONNELL, on 
the basis of this morning’s newspaper, 
doesn’t seem to even show up at the ne-
gotiating table. 
Now, as I mentioned, we have been 
warning 
for 
days 
and 
weeks 
and 
months that enhanced unemployment 
benefits were going to expire at the end 
of July. Republicans sat on their 
hands. 
Earlier, we heard Senate Republicans 
talk about how they had a 1-week pro-
posal which, of course, wouldn’t—based 
on the unemployment experts—get any 
real help to people who need that 
money for rent and groceries anytime 
soon. The Senate Republicans said: 
You know, workers are going over the 
cliff. 
Well, the fact that Republicans have 
sat this debate out is what pushed 
those workers over the cliff—pushed 
them over the cliff—as we warned week 
after week after week that the econ-
omy was cratering and permanent lay-
offs are increasing. 
Senator MERKLEY has joined us. We 
hear all the time at home and in the 
Pacific Northwest about people who 
got laid off once, things seemed to be 
getting better, they got brought back, 
and they were laid off again. So it 
seems—when Senator STABENOW points 
out that this is not just another Thurs-
day in the Senate—that the economy is 
headed in the wrong direction. 
I am just going to spend a couple of 
minutes, as we talk about this issue of 
how things are definitely not right 
here on this Thursday in the Senate, on 
the question of what would it take for 
Senate Republicans to get serious 
about 
working 
with 
us 
on 
a 
coronavirus bill now? How bad would it 
have to get? One-quarter of a million 
Americans’ lives lost? Half a million? 
How many jobless? 40 million? 50 mil-
lion? Does the economy need to con-
tract even more than it did in the sec-
ond quarter before Senate Republicans 
say they are going to work with Demo-
crats to help the economy and help the 
Congress? 
Back in March, there was a basic deal 
between the American people and the 
government to try to make sure that 
there was an effort to try to provide 
help for people as the pandemic took 
hold in this country. Senator STABE-
NOW and I were sort of the point people 
as it related to the big issues in the Fi-
nance Committee. Senator STABENOW, 
doing her usually terrific job on the big 
health issues, and I spent days and 
days 
hearing 
essentially 
from 
the 
Labor 
Secretary, 
Secretary 
Scalia, 
about how he really wasn’t going to 
push hard for much of anything except 
business as usual. But after that dif-
ficult period that went on for days and 
days in the Finance Committee, we ac-
tually got the $600 extra per week, each 
week, and modernized the unemploy-
ment program. As Senator STABENOW 
knows, back when the program began 
in the 1930s, nobody knew about a gig 
worker or the self-employed, or the 
independent contractor, or freelancers, 
and the like. There was a sense that we 
would be working on unemployment 
for a long time, particularly the way it 
was administered, because the States 
have these kinds of bronze-age tech-
nologies. One of the frustrating parts 
of this period is that even though mil-
lions and millions of Americans have 
gotten those extra benefits, that is 
really cold comfort to the many people 
who haven’t been able to get through 
the system and who haven’t been able, 
call after call after call, to get their 
claim resolved. Yet there was the be-
ginning, based on that vote, of a strat-
egy to help people get through the eco-
nomic hardship. 
Right now, the Trump administra-
tion and Republicans in the Congress 
are breaking that deal. The virus is out 
of control, spiking in so many States. 
The key economic lifeline for jobless 
Americans is getting yanked away. It 
is just unconscionable. 
And, now, just in the last few hours, 
there is talk that Donald Trump is 
looking at possibly tomorrow, Senator 
STABENOW, tearing up the Constitution 
and ordering a cut in the Social Secu-
rity and Medicare tax on his own. This 
will not give a dime to the millions of 
families who have lost jobs during the 
pandemic but will put thousands of dol-
lars in the pockets of every lawyer and 
wheeler-dealer who can pay themselves 
a salary while sitting at home. 
What really concerns us—and I have 
been involved in these issues since my 
Gray Panthers days—is one thing that 
Donald Trump is talking about, Sen-
ator STABENOW, and that is draining 
the Social Security trust fund and 
bringing closer the day when Social Se-
curity benefits will be cut. So for all of 
those people who are, say, in their late 
fifties, and they have worked so hard 
and done difficult labor year after year 
after year just hoping—hoping—to be 
able to get Social Security, now Don-
ald Trump is talking about draining 
the Social Security trust fund, cutting 
the Social Security and Medicare tax 
on his own. It sure seems like he has a 
monopoly on bad ideas. 
He is also talking about some kind of 
Executive order on enhanced unem-
ployment benefits, which he actually 
doesn’t have the authority to issue— 
one more Donald Trump ‘‘con’’ oil, an 
additional bit of snake oil. 
With respect to the unemployment 
issue and his idea of an Executive 
order, what he would do there is throw 
State workforce agencies into chaos. 
As we talked about, so many States 
have faced real challenges in getting 
benefits out to all the deserving Ameri-
cans. 
We have been trying, on the Finance 
Committee. 
Senator 
STABENOW
has 
been a big champion of improving tech-
nology. We got $1 billion for the State 
agencies. We are trying to get more. 
Donald Trump’s proposal would just 
end up hurting the jobless Americans 
counting on benefits even more. If Don-
ald Trump were serious about extend-
ing enhanced unemployment coverage, 
he would be working with Democrats 
on extending the benefits instead of 
fighting them. 
I am going to close with this, and it 
is a response to something I have heard 
from many of my Republican col-
leagues who seem to have recovered 
their sense of fiscal conservatism that 
disappeared when Donald Trump was 
inaugurated. I heard some of them say 
that passing another COVID bill would 
amount to sacrificing our children’s fu-
tures. 
Here is what is worse for American 
children: growing up at a time when 
their parents can’t find good-paying 
jobs because of double-digit unemploy-
ment, getting evicted from their homes

in the middle of a pandemic and be-
coming homeless, having to skip meals 
because 
their 
family 
can’t 
afford 
enough food each month, going to 
school in a district that laid off teach-
ers and staff due to the coronavirus re-
cession, which means packing too 
many kids into classrooms, which can 
be dangerous. 
Let’s forget about all of that same 
old Republican deficit talk. It is the 
same old routine from a decade ago and 
a decade before that and a decade be-
fore that. The Republican deficit talk 
was nowhere to be found when they 
passed—over the opposition of Demo-
crats on the Finance Committee—a $2 
trillion tax handout overwhelmingly 
benefiting multinational corporations 
and the wealthy. 
Americans struggle with the pan-
demic and the joblessness crisis right 
now. The Senate needs to deal with it 
right now. 
As Senator STABENOW said—she elo-
quently launched this important dis-
cussion, and I know my friend from Or-
egon is here to be part of it—it is cer-
tainly not another Thursday in the 
Senate, not another garden-variety, 
end of the week when you have en-
hanced unemployment benefits expir-
ing, and 160,000 Americans dying. It is 
unthinkable—unthinkable—that 
any-
body could be going home when there 
are so many challenges right in front 
of us. 
I hope the majority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, and my Republican col-
leagues understand the power of what 
Senator STABENOW has basically out-
lined, because there are times on a 
Thursday afternoon in the Senate 
where I think you could say you 
wouldn’t have the kinds of challenges 
we are talking about. This is not one of 
them. This is one where, on issue after 
issue, there are crises: the COVID cri-
sis, the joblessness crisis, and now we 
have a legislative malpractice crisis by 
Senator MCCONNELL leading his Sen-
ators. 
I urge him to come back, work with 
us, bring about the negotiations we 
need, as I said again and again, on un-
employment. 
I am not going anywhere—not any-
where. This is one of the most impor-
tant causes I have ever had the oppor-
tunity to be a part of. Even with all of 
the challenges with unemployment, I 
can only imagine, Senator STABENOW, 
how much more hurt there would be in 
America without those millions of peo-
ple getting the money for groceries and 
rent and paying medical bills and car 
insurance and keeping the lights on. 
We need the majority leader and Re-
publican colleagues in the U.S. Senate 
to work with us. There is no time to 
waste. They ought to be recognizing 
the power of what Senators have said 
here today. That negotiating needs to 
take place now rather than having yet 
another break for Senators to pursue 
other kinds of matters. 
I thank my colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, is this 
just another Thursday? Are things 
going along well in America, with 
nothing to worry about, nothing to 
keep us up at night, nothing to keep 
mothers and fathers up worried about 
the health of their children? Is this 
just another Thursday with America 
doing well, or are we here in the midst 
of the worst pandemic in a century 
since the Spanish flu? You wouldn’t 
know it from this Chamber. You 
wouldn’t know it from the majority 
leader’s shutting this place down. 
Is it possible that we are in the worst 
economic implosion since the Great 
Depression? Is this just another Thurs-
day? 
You wouldn’t know that we are in a 
terrible economic collapse based on the 
fact that the majority leader is treat-
ing this period of time like just an-
other Thursday, when everything is 
fine and everything is good in America. 
It is almost 3 months ago that the 
House passed a robust bill to address 
the pandemic and to address the eco-
nomic implosion—3 months ago. Why 
didn’t the Senate say immediately, we 
will act, as well, because we are having 
big issues in America? They didn’t act 
after the first week after the House 
acted. They just treated it like another 
week, no concerns. They didn’t act in 
the second week. We are now 11 weeks 
since the House acted and still the ma-
jority leader says: Don’t worry, be 
happy. It is just another Thursday. All 
is good in America—no concerns, no 
anxiety, no worry. Just be happy. 
I can tell you what I am hearing from 
Oregonians. They are saying it is not 
just another Thursday. They are saying 
our State government is estimated to 
lose $10 billion in revenue over the next 
two bienniums—a little less than $3 bil-
lion this biennium, a little more than 
$4 billion in the next biennium, and 
about $3 billion after that. That is $10 
billion of lost revenue for core pro-
grams, like healthcare, housing, edu-
cation, and transportation. That is a 
pretty big deal in terms of the founda-
tions for the programs Oregonians 
count on. 
I am hearing from a whole lot of par-
ents—moms and dads—and they are 
saying: This is not just another Thurs-
day. We are worried about our chil-
dren’s education. 
I recognize there are a lot of rich peo-
ple in America paying for tutors for 
their children, maybe two tutors for a 
child—maybe a math tutor and a read-
ing tutor, maybe a special education 
tutor, who knows—because they are 
rich. 
You know what, most of America are 
ordinary Americans who count on the 
quality of our public schools. I can tell 
you, a lot of parents are worried about 
how are they going to be able to have 
an education for their children given 
the challenge in the school if the 
school can’t afford to convert the way 
it operates, either in the school, in a 
very altered manner, or providing 
workstations 
and 
computers 
and 
broadband so every child has the abil-
ity to work online. 
Now, we know that even that is going 
to be far insufficient because so many 
children are in households where there 
isn’t going to be the type of full-on, all- 
day assistance to help them utilize 
that online access. We know that. 
Shouldn’t we be providing the re-
sources to minimize the gap between 
the best-off and ordinary families? 
Shouldn’t we be trying to do every-
thing for our children? 
My dad was a mechanic. A mechanic 
who works in the sawmill is called a 
millwright. He said it is the best job in 
the world. If he could keep the machin-
ery humming, it meant that every 
worker had a job to come to, and it 
meant the company made money. Ev-
erybody was happy if he could keep the 
machinery running, and he did. He did 
a marvelous job. 
He was pretty disappointed when the 
company was bought by an investor 
and the mill was shut down overnight 
and the timber that the company had 
was sold to another company, a bigger 
company. But, in that context of a fa-
ther with a powerful ability to keep 
machinery humming that would ben-
efit so many other people, he loved the 
fact that we had good public schools. 
He told me: Son, because we live in 
America and have these public schools, 
if you go through the door of that 
schoolhouse and you study hard, you 
can do almost anything in our country. 
What a glorious vision for an ordi-
nary, working American to say to their 
child: Because we live in America, you 
can do almost anything, in our coun-
try. The horizons are boundless be-
cause we have good public schools. 
But it is 11 weeks since the House 
acted. Have we acted to provide good 
public schools? All of our teachers and 
our administrators and our parents and 
our school boards are saying we are 
just around the corner from the ordi-
nary start of school. It is either just 
before or just after Labor Day. 
Where is the U.S. Senate? MITCH 
MCCONNELL sent us home. He shut this 
place down while our children’s edu-
cation, preparation for a very unusual 
and difficult year, goes untended be-
cause there aren’t the resources. 
I can tell you, I am hearing a lot 
from the medical community. My wife, 
Mary, is a nurse. She is a home hospice 
nurse, so she goes and coaches families 
as their loved one goes through the 
final chapter of their life here on our 
planet. A lot of these folks that she 
visits, because they are in hospice, it, 
by definition, means they are quite ill. 
Often, the families around them are el-
derly, and they are very concerned 
about 
any 
presence 
of 
COVID, 
coronavirus. What she hears is that we 
need to tackle this pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5259 
August 6, 2020 
What 
do 
the 
scientists 
and 
healthcare experts say? They say a na-
tional investment in personal protec-
tive equipment; they say a national in-
vestment in a testing strategy to be 
able to do massive numbers of tests to 
help identify folks who are carrying 
the virus and spreading the virus but 
are asymptomatic, as well as those who 
actually have symptoms; and a massive 
national investment in tracing so that 
we can follow up when somebody is 
identified as carrying the virus—Who 
did they get it from? Who did they 
have contact with?—so those folks can 
go into quarantine and stop the chain 
of infection from person to person to 
person. 
The House, 11 weeks ago, passed a 
bill that has massive resources for test-
ing and tracing, and for 11 weeks, the 
leadership of this body has said: Not 
needed. Let’s do nothing. Let’s just 
treat this as just another Thursday. No 
concern. 
Then I hear from folks who are really 
worried about the nutrition for our 
children—not just the education but 
nutrition. We worked hard to get the 
EBT program to help out because of 
school sites being shut down, but what 
about this coming year? Why aren’t we 
helping with nutrition? 
The House, 11 weeks ago, acted, but 
here, it is just another Thursday—no 
crisis, no concern when children across 
America are going hungry. The bill 
that the House passed had resources for 
State and local government to help ad-
dress the hemorrhaging of funds. I 
noted that Oregon predicts, just in its 
State government, a loss of $10 billion 
over next three biennium—or this bien-
nium and the next two. For them to 
sustain their basic programs, they need 
help. 
I heard today from the president of 
one of our public universities—our 4- 
year university, Oregon State Univer-
sity in Corvallis—and they were esti-
mating a massive loss of revenue. They 
need this bill, which would direct sup-
port for our 4-year institutions. They 
know that the State, if it is going to be 
able to sustain its support for the uni-
versities, so that the money doesn’t 
come in the front door and out the 
back door, we need to provide help to 
the State government. I know this 
isn’t a blue-red issue. I know that blue 
and red Governors are saying the same 
thing. I know blue and red county com-
missioners are asking for the same 
help. 
So I say to my colleagues, it is mor-
ally unacceptable to just say: This is 
another Thursday. All is well. We have 
waited 11 weeks to act after the House. 
What is another week? What does it 
matter if a family that has been able to 
pay its rent or its mortgage or its utili-
ties or put food on the table because 
they got $600 a week extra help in un-
employment, what does it matter if 
they lose their home? What does it 
matter if they are evicted? 
Well, I will tell you this: It matters a 
hell of a lot—a huge impact on that 
family for a long time to come. I don’t 
know how many of my colleagues have 
worked in the area of assisting home-
less families, but when you are desta-
bilized, when you are tossed out, when 
you experience homelessness, when you 
are living in your car with your kids or 
it is a basement this week and it is a 
van the next and who knows what shel-
ter will let you in, it destabilizes and 
knocks you down for a long time. It 
makes it hard to get ready to go to a 
job interview. It makes it hard to 
present yourself effectively in a job 
interview. It puts all kinds of stresses 
on the family relationship. 
Is it really OK that we shut the Sen-
ate down when families are going to be 
evicted because we shut off that $600 
per week and the moratorium on evic-
tions expired? 
This, colleagues, is not just another 
Thursday. This is a moment of na-
tional crisis, a pandemic crisis, an eco-
nomic crisis, and we need to be in crisis 
mode. We need to be here day and 
night. We need to be working on each 
of these issues that were addressed 11 
weeks ago in the House while this body 
sat on its hands. 
Sitting on your hands when the peo-
ple of America need us, that is not ac-
ceptable in the U.S. Senate. Let’s act 
boldly. Let’s act decisively. Let’s rec-
ognize that we must rise to meet this 
national challenge and do so now. 
I yield to my colleague from Michi-
gan. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
want to thank both of my friends from 
Oregon. We are Oregon strong on the 
floor. We have great, powerful, effec-
tive Senators from Oregon, and I want 
to thank Senator MERKLEY
for his 
words, as well as my colleagues and 
friends from Delaware and New Hamp-
shire and Maryland. 
We are on the floor today because we 
know this isn’t just another regular 
Thursday where you can close up for 
the week and go home and do whatever 
is going to be done and then maybe 
come back Monday, maybe Tuesday, 
maybe Wednesday. We don’t know be-
cause we don’t know what is happening 
on negotiations. But, oh, well, there is 
no real sense of urgency anyway, right? 
There is an incredible sense of ur-
gency, and, as we have been saying this 
afternoon, this should not be treated 
like just another end of the Senate 
week on a Thursday afternoon. We 
have the largest health pandemic in a 
hundred years. As of today, it is about 
160,000 deaths in this country. You 
can’t even wrap your head around that: 
160,000 people. Yet we are a little over 
4 percent of the world’s population. We 
have 25 percent of the deaths. 
This did not have to happen. This 
should never have happened. It should 
never have happened. And to be in a 
situation where people are acting as if 
we have got all the time in the world— 
how many people have to die before we 
wrap our arms around what is hap-
pening and have a national strategy on 
testing and on contact tracing and a 
national strategy to make sure we 
have all of the testing materials and 
the PPE and everything that our doc-
tors and nurses and other professionals 
need and we are treating this with the 
seriousness that it deserves? 
This is a health pandemic. We have 
to get our arms around this. We have 
to be able to manage it until we can 
get vaccines. We did come together and 
work together on a bipartisan basis in 
the beginning. That is what is just so 
frustrating and disheartening and mad-
dening about this situation we are in 
now, as we go forward, because it is not 
done. 
I wish it was, for my own family and 
everyone else’s. It is not even close to 
being done, and we have a responsi-
bility to continue to be there and to 
have people’s backs to address the pan-
demic and all of the economic hardship 
that has happened as a result of that. 
Now, in the CARES package, it was 
comprehensive. It was great that we 
were able to come together. One of the 
things was that the Treasury, the Fed, 
was able to basically have the capacity 
to have a safety net under the stock 
market, under our large businesses: 
Don’t worry. Keep investing. We have 
got a safety net for you. 
But for somebody on unemployment, 
somebody who is worrying about feed-
ing their children tonight, tomorrow, 
the next day—somebody who is worried 
that the water is going to get shut off 
or they are going to lose their shelter 
right in the middle of a pandemic when 
we tell people, ‘‘stay home and, by the 
way, wash your hands frequently,’’ and 
then the water gets turned off or you 
have no shelter and you are on the 
street or you can’t feed the kids, or the 
additional money—the $600 that was al-
lowing you to pay those bills—goes 
away, which is about a 60-percent cut, 
in Michigan, for people getting help— 
no safety net for you. Unh-unh. 
There are over 31 million people right 
now who are on unemployment insur-
ance, and somehow, people want to 
have us believe that nobody wants to 
work, that there are over 31 million 
jobs out there and people just don’t 
want to take them; they just don’t 
want to work. 
I can tell you that is not true in 
Michigan. People in Michigan work. 
We grow things. We make things. We 
innovate. We build things. People in 
Michigan work and work hard. 
It is not their fault that we have a 
100-year health pandemic that has 
pushed everybody back down and taken 
away the capacity for businesses to be 
safely open and for people to continue 
their jobs. People would expect that in 
the United States of America all of us 
would care about that and that it 
wouldn’t just be another Thursday 
afternoon, closing up shop for the 
weekend or beyond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5260 
August 6, 2020 
There is one other thing I want to 
stress when we talk about supporting 
communities right now. The President 
said: It is up to the Governors to step 
up. It is up to local communities to 
step up to keep people safe. No na-
tional response is necessary. 
It is the Governors, the mayors, the 
county commissioners. They have done 
that. They have done that. They took 
all of their resources to make sure they 
could do everything humanly possible 
to make sure they could help people be 
safe: Get the PPE, create a way for 
people to get testing, do all of the 
other things to help people. Now, for 
the Senate and for the President of the 
United States to say that we have no 
responsibility to step up and have their 
back and support them is incredibly ir-
responsible. 
What I find so interesting—who are 
we talking about locally? We want the 
restaurants to open. Yet you have to 
have a food inspector before you can 
open the restaurant. In Michigan, that 
is funded through the county—through 
county government. 
We are concerned about first respond-
ers—police and fire and 9–1-1 call cen-
ters and all of the people who respond 
to keep us safe. Do you know who the 
largest group is that will be losing 
their jobs without help for local com-
munities and States? It is the first re-
sponders and law enforcement. 
In fact, I had a very prominent police 
leader in Michigan tell me that the 
only people he saw trying to defund the 
police were Donald Trump and MITCH 
MCCONNELL
because they didn’t and 
aren’t—the Senate Republicans aren’t 
willing to step up to support funding 
for first responders, as well as the pub-
lic health department, as well as the 
teachers, as well as everyone else in-
volved. 
These are not normal times. These 
are not normal times in terms of the 
health risks for families. These are not 
normal times in terms of our economy 
and what is happening—not even to 
count the fact that racial disparities 
are on full display now in front of us in 
every part of our economy and serv-
ices. 
This is not a normal time. This 
should not be a normal Thursday after-
noon in the U.S. Senate. Every single 
one of my Democratic colleagues feels 
a sense of urgency and panic about 
what is happening. People need help. 
There are incredible hardships, and 
they deserve that help. 
The U.S. House of Representatives 
passed help over 21⁄2 months ago. Sen-
ator MCCONNELL at the time said that 
he felt no sense of urgency. In fact, he 
suggested that States and cities go 
bankrupt. That is one way to do it: Lay 
off all the police officers, firefighters, 
food inspectors, teachers. 
People in our country—and I know 
people in Michigan—feel an incredible 
sense of urgency to both manage and 
get beyond this healthcare pandemic, 
which is not going to be easy. It is 
going to take all of us working to-
gether. But they are anxious to do 
that, and they are anxious to open up 
the economy safely and to open up our 
schools safely and to know that there 
is some sense of normalcy that we can 
count on again. 
That is going to take all of us work-
ing together on a bipartisan basis to 
get it done. It is going to take a sense 
of urgency, a sense of responsibility for 
the role that we play at this moment 
in time in the history of our country 
and people’s lives. It is going to take a 
lot of hard work. It is going to take po-
litical will more than anything else be-
cause the other things we can do. We 
have to decide we to want to do them. 
I hope very, very soon that Senator 
MCCONNELL, our Senate Republican 
colleagues, 
the 
President 
and 
the 
White House decide that they want to 
work with us to really get things done 
for people all across our country. 
I yield the floor.

jority leader.

REMEMBERING THE REVEREND 
DR. C.T. VIVIAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in his 
powerful eulogy for Congressman John 
Lewis, President Barack Obama de-
scribed John Lewis as a man who 
‘‘brought this country a little bit clos-
er to our highest ideals.’’ President 
Obama went on to say, ‘‘And someday 
when we do finish that long journey to-
wards freedom, when we do form a 
more perfect union—whether it’s years 
from now or decades or even if it takes 
another two centuries—John Lewis 
will be a founding father of that fuller, 
fairer, better America.’’ Such a beau-
tiful and fitting epitaph. 
Another founder of that ‘‘fuller, fair-
er, better America’’ was the Reverend 
Dr. C.T. Vivian. C.T. Vivian and John 
Lewis departed this life on the same 
day. The timing of their leaving is 
proof, perhaps, that Mark Twain was 
right when he said that history does 
not repeat itself, but sometimes it 
rhymes. 
Who was C.T. Vivian? Martin Luther 
King called him ‘‘the greatest preacher 
ever to live.’’ The Reverend Gerald 
Durley, who met C.T. Vivian in 1960 
when Durley was a member of the 
Nashville Student Movement and who 
delivered the eulogy at his home going, 
called Dr. Vivian ‘‘the most patient im-
patient man’’ he ever met. Patient 
with people but impatient with injus-
tice. 
C.T. Vivian was mentor to John 
Lewis, Diane Nash, and many other 
brave young civil rights activists a half 
century ago. Before they sat at those 
segregated lunch counters or boarded 
those Freedom Rider buses, Dr. Vivian 
taught them about the tactics—and the 
transformative power—of nonviolent 
civil disobedience. 
He was as a Baptist minister, an 
early civil rights organizer, and a 
member of Martin Luther King’s inner 
circle or advisers. As field general for 
Dr. King and his Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, Dr. Vivian was 
the national director of some 85 local 
affiliate chapters of the SCLC from 1963 
to 1966, directing protest activities and 
training in nonviolence, and coordi-
nating voter registration and commu-
nity development projects. 
He 
led 
passive 
protests 
through 
angry mobs and was beaten viciously 
by segregationists, but he never once 
struck back. He received his first beat-
ing in 1961 on a Freedom Ride to Mis-
sissippi. In 1964, a white mob beat him 
with chains and nearly drowned him in 
the Atlantic Ocean in St. Augustine, 
FL. 
In Selma, AL, in 1965, 2 weeks before 
Bloody Sunday, Dr. Vivian was trying 
to register Africa-American residents 
to 
vote 
when 
Sheriff 
Jim 
Clark 
punched him in the mouth so hard that 
the blow sent the minister reeling 
down the courthouse steps. Sheriff 
Clark then ordered deputies to arrest 
him for ‘‘criminal provocation.’’ Tele-
vision coverage of Dr. Vivian being 
dragged away, blood streaming down 
his face, helped galvanize the voting 
rights movement. 
C.T. Vivian was a hero to all Ameri-
cans, but many in my State feel a spe-
cial connection to him because of the 
formative years he spent among us. He 
was, like many great Illinoisans, an 
adopted son of the Land of Lincoln. 
He was born Cordy Tindell Vivian in 
Boonville, Missouri, on July 30, 1924, 
the only child of Robert and Euzetta 
Tindell Vivian. His father left the fam-
ily when he was a baby. His mother 
lost the family farm in the Depression 
and the family home in town to arson. 
When C.T. was 6, he moved with this 
mother and maternal grandmother to 
Macomb, Illinois. The women chose 
Macomb because its public schools 
were integrated. They had great expec-
tations for C.T. and they believed in 
the power of education. C.T. Vivian 
joined his first protest in Peoria, IL, in 
1947, helping to desegregate a down-
town cafeteria. In many parts of Illi-
nois at the time, segregation of public 
facilities was not a law, but it was a 
custom rigidly enforced. 
He first heard Dr. King speak in 1957, 
while studying for the ministry at the 
American Baptist College in Nashville. 
In 1959, he met th Reverend James 
Lawson, who was teaching nonviolent 
strategies to members of the Nashville 
Student Movement, including a young 
John Lewis. 
After leaving the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference in 1966, Dr. Viv-
ian returned to Illinois—this time to 
Chicago—to direct the Urban Training 
Center for Christian Missions, where he 
trained clergy, community leaders and 
others to organize. He worked to ad-
vance civil rights and educational and 
economic opportunities for African 
Americans, and to reduce the gang vio-
lence that ensnared to many young 
Black men. 
He left Chicago in 1972 to become 
dean of the Shaw University Divinity 
School in Raleigh, NC. He moved to At-
lanta later in the 1970s and founded the 
C.T. Vivian Leadership Institute, to 
continue to train the next generation 
of leaders in the principals and tactics 
of nonviolent change. 
In 2013, Dr. Vivian received the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom—our Na-
tion’s highest civilian honor, from 
President Barack Obama. It was a mov-
ing and historic moment and I was 
honored to be there. 
He died on July 17, 2 weeks shy of his 
96th birthday. He is buried in Atlanta 
next to his fellow foot soldier for jus-
tice, Dr. King. 
In the last calendar year, we have 
lost Elijah Cummings, the Reverend 
Dr. Joseph Lowry, John Lewis and Dr. 
C.T. Vivian—all giants in the civil 
rights movement. This is the passing of 
a great generation, founders of the 
‘‘fuller, fairer, better America,’’ as 
President Obama said. As we mourn 
their passing, let us also give thanks 
for their lives, and resolve to use the 
blueprints they left us to continue to-
wards a more perfect union. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DR. BABU PRASAD 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1971, a 
young 
doctor 
named 
Babu 
Prasad 
boarded a plane in his native India, 
headed for America. He was 24 years 
old and 1 year out of medical school. 
His first stop was Canton, OH where he 
worked for a short while before moving 
to Chicago to complete a residency in 
anesthesiology at the University of Il-
linois-Chicago. 
He spent the following decade prac-
ticing medicine in Alabama before re-
turning to Illinois, this time to the 
Springfield area, where he spent the 
next 18 years practicing anesthesiology 
at HSHS St. John’s Hospital before re-
tiring in 2004. 
Two weeks ago, this doctor who ar-
rived in America as a young man with 
no money announced that he was do-
nating $1 million to HSHS St. John’s 
to support a major expansion of the 
hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. 
An article in The State Journal-Reg-
ister, Springfield’s hometown news-
paper, called Dr. Prasad’s gift his ‘‘love 
letter to the hospital and community.’’ 
At a press conference announcing his 
donation, Dr. Prasad said simply: ‘‘I 
want to give back to a country that 
has given so much to my family and 
me.’’ 
‘‘Children are our future, so I wanted 
to direct by gift to the neonatal inten-
sive care unit, to give the babies a 
healthy start in life,’’ said Dr. Prasad.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5263 
August 6, 2020 
Dr. Prasad and his wife, Dr. Sudah 
Prasad, an immunologist, have been 
quiet and consistent donors to St. 
John’s NICU over the years. Their lat-
est gift of $1 million will support a 
major expansion of St. John’s neonatal 
intensive care unit. The expansion, ex-
pected to be finished in February, will 
more than double the size of the cur-
rent NICU and provide single-family 
patient rooms for premature and criti-
cally ill infants. 
As a father whose first baby came 
into this world with serious health 
challenges, I have a sense of what such 
supportive accommodations will mean 
to families of sick and fragile babies, 
and I am grateful to Dr. Prasad for his 
generous support of this worthy cause. 
St. John’s was one of the first hos-
pitals in Illinois to establish a NICU 
for premature and critically ill infants. 
Each year, about 2,00 babies are born at 
St. John’s, and about 700 babies from 35 
Illinois counties receive care in the 
hospital’s NICU. 
In announcing Dr. Prasad’s donation, 
Beverly Neisler, chief development offi-
cer for the HSHS St. John’s Founda-
tion said, ‘‘Dr. Prasad’s gift is a beau-
tiful testament as to who he is as a 
person. He is a generous and kind man 
who has built a successful life through 
hard work, dedication and determina-
tion. He means so much to us.’’ 
‘‘A golden opportunity’’ is how Dr. 
Prasad remembers his chance to come 
to America nearly a half-century ago. 
‘‘It felt like heaven,’’ he says, nothing 
like India in the 1970s. At 24, he had 
never before seen TV. 
Nearly 50 years later, Dr. Prasad is a 
father of three and grandfather of six. 
Two of his daughters have followed him 
into the medical profession. Dr. Prasad 
himself continues to practice anesthe-
siology and pain management 2 weeks 
each month at a private medical prac-
tice in the Springfield area. 
The current COVID crisis reminds us 
daily how much we depend on the skills 
and sacrifices of fronteline medical 
workers and how many of those med-
ical workers are, like Dr. Prasad, im-
migrants. We are fortunate and we are 
safer and healthier because they have 
chosen to make America their home. 
On behalf of the families of Illinois, I 
want to thank Dr. Prasad again for 
keeping two generations of Illinoisans 
healthy and for his generous gift to fu-
ture generations.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH 
AMENDMENT 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
to celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
the passage of the 19th Amendment, 
providing suffrage for all sexes in the 
Constitution of the United States. 
The amendment states that the right 
to vote ‘‘shall not be denied or abridged 
by the United States or by any State 
on account of sex.’’ The suffrage Move-
ment opened the doors to women’s par-
ticipation in the electoral process and 
contributed to equitable civic leader-
ship and engagement. 
Today, I honor the historic milestone 
of the women’s suffrage movement, and 
the contributions from my home state 
of Vermont, while acknowledging the 
barriers to voting that have harmed 
and continue to harm some of the most 
marginalized people in our country. 
Vermont’s contributions to the suf-
frage movement ranged from participa-
tion on the local level to the national 
marches. Vermonters fought for wom-
en’s legal civic participation in our 
schools, municipal offices, and our 
State legislature, along with the na-
tional right to vote. I am grateful to 
every Vermonter who fought a more 
equitable political system. 
Notable Vermont suffragists include 
Clarina Howard Nichols of Townshend, 
who 
fought 
for 
women’s 
property 
rights. Annette Parmalee of Wash-
ington, one of the most outspoken suf-
fragists in my State, who fought for 
suffrage locally, statewide and nation-
ally. And Lucy Daniel of Grafton, who 
used civil disobedience to lend her 
weight to the fight. I am proud of every 
Vermonter’s contribution to the move-
ment and helping our country expand 
access to the ballot box. 
Suffragists were women of races, 
ages, and political backgrounds. Yet 
after the 19th Amendment, millions of 
women—particularly 
African-Ameri-
cans in the Jim Crow South—remained 
shut out of the polls for decades. Many 
States and municipalities continued to 
ignore the 15th and 19th Amendments, 
effectively withholding voting rights 
from women, Black people, and anyone 
who was low-income or ‘‘uneducated’’. 
The harm was most profound at the 
intersection of marginalized groups. 
I find the efforts to stop people from 
voting to be deeply unpatriotic—then 
and now. In our long history, the 
United States has made it harder for 
some individuals to be civically en-
gaged because of their gender identity, 
their income, or race. We know that 
the literacy tests kept those shut out 
of the education system from the elec-
toral process. We know that poll taxes 
kept poor people from casting a ballot. 
And we know that barriers to voting 
still exist today. 
We have seen people from majority 
Black districts wait in line for double 
the amount of time as their neigh-
boring white districts. We have seen el-
igible voters turned away because of 
inaccurate voting roll purges. From 
gerrymandering, to archaic voter ID 
laws, to limiting voter registration, 
discriminatory efforts still exist that 
harm our democracy and deprive Amer-
icans of a government that represents 
them. In my view, voting should be a 
simple process. We should be passing 
laws to make it easier to vote, not 
harder. 
First and foremost, we must rein-
state the Voting Rights Act. We need 
to make election day a national holi-
day so that more people are able to get 
to the polls without losing time or 
wages from work. We need to expand 
automatic voter registration, early 
voting and vote-by-mail capabilities. 
We need to address voter suppression 
head on. And we must overturn the Su-
preme Court’s Citizens United decision 
and reform campaign finance laws to 
prevent large corporations and billion-
aires from having an outsized voice in 
the electoral process. 
Today in honor of the centennial of 
the 19th Amendment, I call on Ameri-
cans to pursue equity with the same 
vigor as the suffragists. Question rules 
and laws that obstruct political par-
ticipation. Speak out against injus-
tices. And continue to fight for policies 
that center our Nation’s political proc-
ess on ‘‘we the people.’’ 
f 
30TH ANNIVERSARY OF PASSAGE 
OF THE AMERICANS WITH DIS-
ABILITIES ACT 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of a significant 
anniversary in our Nation’s history. 
Thirty years ago, on July 26, 1990, 
President George H.W. Bush signed 
into law the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act, ADA. Because of the monu-
mental impact on individuals with dis-
abilities, the ADA remains one of the 
most celebrated pieces of civil rights 
legislation today. 
Behind the ADA is a specific vision: a 
more equitable, accessible and inclu-
sive America. This watershed legisla-
tion sought to eradicate the discrimi-
nation that long confronted individuals 
with disabilities in the United States 
in many areas—including employment, 
education, transportation, and govern-
ment services. The ADA established a 
clear and comprehensive national man-
date to ensure individuals with disabil-
ities have equal opportunities to par-
ticipate in their communities. 
We can be proud of organizations in 
Arkansas dedicated to providing serv-
ices and life-enhancing skills so indi-
viduals with disabilities can engage in 
everyday activities and independent 
living. 
To commemorate the 30th anniver-
sary of the ADA, the Senate recently 
passed S. Res. 661 recognizing this 
landmark legislation and the impor-
tance of independent living for individ-
uals with disabilities that was made 
possible with this law. 
In celebration of this milestone, I am 
proud to recognize the advancement of 
disability rights in Arkansas and na-
tionwide.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I was 
necessarily absent but had I been 
present would have voted no on rollcall 
vote 153, motion to proceed to the 
House message to accompany S.178, a 
bill to condemn gross human rights 
violations of ethnic Turkic Muslims in 
Xinjiang calling for an end to arbitrary 
detention, torture, and harassment of 
these communities inside and outside

TRIBUTE TO CHIEF FAUSEY AND 
ASSISTANT CHIEF GOODBROD 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the he-
roic acts of two Pennsylvania volun-
teer firefighters, Chief Howard M. 
Fausey, Sr., and Assistant Chief Ethan 
Goodbrod of Citizen’s Hose Company, 
Station 45, in Jersey Shore, PA. 
On the evening of February 15, 2020, 
Chief 
Fausey 
and 
Assistant 
Chief 
Goodbrod responded to a multiple 
alarm fire reported at the Broadway 
Hotel and Restaurant in Jersey Shore, 
PA. The hotel is a historic building 
with multiple residential apartments 
in its upper levels. When Chief Fausey 
and Assistant Chief Goodbrod arrived 
on the scene, the building was already 
consumed in flames, and they soon 
learned that a man was trapped on the 
third floor. Without regard to their 
own personal safety, these volunteer 
firefighters climbed to the third floor 
on ladders, forced their way into the 
building by breaking a window and re-
moving an air-conditioner, found the 
trapped man amidst heavy smoke, and 
safely removed him from the building. 
And they did not arrive a moment too 
soon. The man they rescued suffered 
severe burns and smoke inhalation 
while he was trapped inside. Thanks to 
Chief Fausey’s and Assistant Chief 
Goodbrod’s heroism, he lived to see an-
other day and has recovered from his 
injuries. 
Chief Fausey’s and Assistant Chief 
Goodbrod’s courageous acts call atten-
tion to the heroic service that first re-
sponders provide for their communities 
every day, often on a volunteer basis. 
In fact, Citizens Hose Company, Sta-
tion 45, is made up entirely of volun-
teers. These individuals, many of whom 
hail from generations of voluntary 
service, place themselves in harm’s 
way to protect the rest of us. 
We should never take for granted the 
risks that first responders take to en-
sure that we are safe in our commu-
nities. I want to say to Chief Fausey, 
to Assistant Chief Goodbrod, and to all 
of Pennsylvania’s first responders, that 
we are grateful for the service that you 
provide to the community and thank-
ful for your sacrifices.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO TRISTA HOVDE 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Trista Hovde of Richland County for 
her outstanding achievement in earn-
ing a position on the North Dakota 
State/Provincial National High School 
rodeo team. 
Trista, a junior at Sidney High 
School, traveled with her fellow team-
mates to Guthrie, OK, to compete in 
the 72nd National High School Finals 
Rodeo. She partook in the barrel rac-
ing, girls’ cutting, and reined cow 
horse competitions. 
The NHSFR boasts the title of the 
largest rodeo in the world, featuring 
over 1,650 contestants from 43 States as 
well as Canada, Australia, and Mexico. 
Participating in the NHSFR is a tre-
mendous honor and I know that she has 
made both her community and Mon-
tana very proud. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Trista for her tireless dedication to the 
rodeo community and her unique con-
tributions to Sidney and Montana. Her 
drive and ambition serve as an inspira-
tion to all young Montanans to strive 
to do the best that they can in every-
thing they do. I look forward to fol-
lowing Trista’s rodeo career and all of 
her future accomplishment.∑

RECOGNIZING 
MAAG 
PRESCRIP-
TION & MEDICAL SUPPLY 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to 
honor Maag Prescription & Medical 
Supply in Pocatello as the Idaho Small 
Business of the Month for August 2020 
and congratulate them on 70 years of 
business. 
Maag Prescription & Medical Supply 
is an independent, locally owned phar-
macy which has been operated by the 
Maag family since 1950. Established by 
Irvin and Genevieve Maag, the couple 
ran all aspects of the business and 
quickly developed a reputation for pro-
viding exemplary service while meet-
ing the specific needs of their cus-
tomers. As the business flourished and 
ownership transitioned to their son and 
daughter-in-law, Greg and Kathy Maag, 
a fire ravaged the facility in 1977. The 
Maags quickly sprang into action and 
rebuilt their business across the street 
with the strong support of the Poca-
tello community. 
Forty-three years later, Maag Pre-
scription & Medical Supply remains a 
staple in Southeast Idaho, providing 
more than 20 jobs to the community 
and expanding three times to meet the 
needs of their customers. Their ability 
to adapt quickly and meet customer 
demands has been especially important 
during the COVID–19 pandemic, with 
the business now offering curbside 
pickup, free home delivery of prescrip-
tions and oxygen tanks, and in-house 
production of hand sanitizer for the 
community. Their emphasis on cus-
tomer satisfaction has been central to 
their continued success. 
Maag 
Prescription 
& 
Medical 
Supply’s resiliency and service to the 
community has not gone unnoticed. 
For the past 2 years, the business re-
ceived the Idaho State Journal’s an-
nual Reader’s Choice award. Their 
business stands as a true testament to 
American 
industriousness, 
exem-
plifying one of our Nation’s most treas-
ured values. Now, in one of the most 
economically uncertain times, their 
story reminds us of the importance of 
commitment to our communities and 
resilience in the face of adversity. 
Congratulations to Greg and Kathy 
Maag and all of the employees of Maag 
Prescription & Medical Supply on 
being selected as the Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Month for August 2020. You 
make our great State proud, and I look 
forward to your continued growth and 
success.∑

REMEMBERING BEN HILL GRIFFIN, 
III 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I pay trib-
ute to the memory of Ben Hill Griffin, 
III, a lifelong resident of Polk County 
who left a lasting impact on Florida 
and the citrus industry. 
Ben Hill Griffin, III, was born on 
March 3, 1942, in Frostproof, FL, to Ben 
Hill Griffin, Jr., and his wife, Frances. 
The only son of five children, Ben Hill 
worked his father’s cattle ranches and 
citrus fields at a young age, learning 
early that success requires hard work 
and long hours. 
While 
attending 
Frostproof 
High 
School, Ben Hill played several sports 
and attended Boys’ State, where he was 
fittingly elected commissioner of agri-
culture. After graduation, he attended 
the University of Florida before return-
ing home to Frostproof. 
Ben Hill spent a year at the Lake Al-
fred Experiment Station, gaining expe-
rience with various aspects of the cit-
rus industry before joining his father’s 
business. He spent a year and a half 
working in the fertilizer division, 3 
years in the harvesting division, and 2 
years in the processing and sales divi-
sions. After paying his dues, his father 
welcomed him into Ben Hill Griffin, 
Inc., naming him president and chief 
operating officer. He would later serve 
as its chairman of the board and chief 
executive officer. 
Throughout his career, Ben Hill was 
recognized as a thoughtful leader and 
savvy businessman within the Florida 
agricultural and citrus industries and 
statewide business communities. He 
was elected to numerous corporate 
boards, served in leadership positions 
and they became better companies 
under his leadership. 
During his time as chairman of the 
Florida Citrus Commission, Ben Hill 
flew to New York to defend the State

TRIBUTE TO SHERYL AVERY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
honor Sheryl Avery, the Liberty Coun-
ty Teacher of the Year from Liberty 
County High School in Bristol, FL. 
Sheryl believes that being a teacher 
means understanding her students will 
eventually become leaders of our soci-
ety. Her lifelong goal is to seek oppor-
tunities to change the world, which she 
believes can be done from the class-
room. 
Sheryl believes that writing is an im-
portant skill. It is a skill that all stu-
dents need to know, not just for school, 
but for when they join the workforce. 
She is a published author with three 
works in print and enjoys writing in 
her spare time. 
Sheryl teaches English for ninth and 
tenth graders at Liberty County High 
School. She has worked as an educator 
for 21 years, with 19 years in the Lib-
erty 
County 
School 
System. 
She 
earned her bachelor’s degree in English 
and ESOL from Armstrong Atlantic 
State University, her master’s degree 
in curriculum and instruction from 
Georgia Southern University, and is 
currently studying for her doctorate 
degree in theology from South Univer-
sity. 
I extend my best wishes to Sheryl on 
her more than two decades of teaching 
students. I look forward to hearing of 
her continued good work in the years 
to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO KERRIANNE 
EDWARDS 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize 
Kerrianne 
Edwards, 
the 
Jackson County Teacher of the Year 
from Sneads Elementary School in 
Sneads, FL. 
Kerrianne comes from a family of 
teachers. Her parents were teachers 
and played a pivotal role in encour-
aging her to make the profession her 
career. Kerrianne teaches at the same 
elementary school that she attended, 
and her classroom is located directly 
across from Sherry Faircloth, the same 
first grade teacher that taught her and 
her son. She considers Mrs. Faircloth 
an excellent role model and continues 
to teach her long after she was her stu-
dent. 
Kerrianne is a first grade teacher at 
Sneads Elementary School and has 
been a teacher for 28 years. She pre-
viously was a librarian, K–3 teacher, 
and a second grade teacher at Chat-
tahoochee Elementary School and was 
named its Teacher of the Year in 2000. 
I offer my sincere gratitude to 
Kerrianne and look forward to hearing 
of her continued good work in the

TRIBUTE TO TONIE GARCIA 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to recognize Tonie Garcia, 
the Glades County Teacher of the Year 
from West Glades School in LaBelle, 
FL. 
Tonie knew she wanted to be a teach-
er from a young age, crediting God for 
placing a love for teaching in her 
heart. She brings a positive attitude 
and patience to her classroom each 
day, knowing that some of her students 
see her more than they see their par-
ents. 
Tonie considers it her job to love and 
cheer for her students, wipe away their 
tears, and open the doors of learning to 
them. She does not know what her stu-
dents go through before coming to 
class each day, so she shows them 
kindness and instills in them a ‘‘never 
give up’’ attitude, no matter how chal-
lenging the day may be for them. 
Tonie is a kindergarten teacher at 
West Glades School. She is a graduate 
of Palm Beach Atlantic University and 
credits its school of education and be-
havioral studies for preparing her to be 
a teacher. She previously taught in 
kindergarten classrooms at Frontier 
Elementary School and Jupiter Chris-
tian School. 
I offer my sincere gratitude to Tonie 
and look forward to hearing of her con-
tinued good work in the years to 
come.∑

TRIBUTE TO LESLIE HARN 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Leslie J. Harn, the Hendry 
County Teacher of the Year from 
Clewiston High School in Clewiston, 
FL. 
Leslie’s goal each day is to make his 
classroom one where students enjoy 
learning. He spends the school day 
helping students to better understand 
science and other challenges that life 
has thrown at them. Leslie credits his 
seventh grade science teacher, Mr. 
Bowdler, with having a huge impact on 
him and hopes to have the same effect 
on his students’ lives. 
Leslie’s biggest inspiration for teach-
ing comes from his faith and his fam-
ily. His father was an orange grove 
manager, and his mother drove a 
school bus. Both instilled in him a 
strong work ethic and desire to help 
others whenever possible. In his family, 
three are educators, and the fourth is 
in college with plans to pursue edu-
cation. 
Leslie teaches biology at Clewiston 
High School and previously taught in 
Collier County. He and his wife are 
members of Caloosa Baptist Church 
and work to help families throughout 
the area. 
I am grateful for Leslie’s commit-
ment to his students and extend my 
best wishes. I look forward to learning 
of his continued good work in his fu-
ture endeavors.∑

TRIBUTE TO MIRANDA HARWOOD 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize 
Miranda 
Harwood, 
the 
Hillsborough County Teacher of the 
Year from Brooker Elementary School 
in Brandon, FL. 
Miranda teaches fourth grade at 
Brooker Elementary School and con-
siders this award the culmination of 
the educational career she began 14 
years ago. Miranda wants her students 
to know that she cares about their edu-
cation. Since she cannot know what 
burdens they are going through at 
home, she works to make sure school is 
a safe and caring place for them, 
whether they are in her classroom or 
with another teacher. She uses testing 
data to identify her students’ strengths 
and weaknesses and builds her lesson 
plans to fit their individual needs. 
Miranda uses humor and motiva-
tional activities to keep her students 
engaged throughout the school year. 
Her class votes on a Student of the 
Month and chooses rewards and con-
sequences. She also hosts a Monday 
Math Club for her top students and 
afterschool sessions on Wednesdays and 
Thursdays for those below their grade 
level on State exams or on the bubble 
between passing and not passing. 
I offer my sincere gratitude to Mi-
randa for her good work and dedication 
to her students. I look forward to hear-
ing of her continued success in the 
years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO VINCENT MILLER 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to recognize Vincent Mil-
ler, the Polk County Teacher of the 
Year from Winter Haven High School 
in Winter Haven, FL. 
Vincent believes as teachers enter 
their classrooms, they should 
ask 
themselves a few simple questions: 
What will they add to their students’ 
lives? What class memories will stu-
dents remember? How will they, them-
selves, be remembered by students? 
He says teachers should be inten-
tional with their approach to meeting 
students’ needs, knowing students are 
more than just a score or a test; they 
are the future. Vincent credits his suc-
cesses today to his former teachers for 
creating countless memories when he 
was a student. Being cast by one teach-
er for a school play changed his life, al-
lowing him to travel the world and per-
form on cruise ships before becoming a 
teacher at his alma mater. 
Vincent is a math teacher and the 
girls’ basketball coach at Winter Haven 
High School. He also mentors students, 
provides afterschool tutoring lessons, 
hosts a back-to-school supplies event, 
and sponsors the Key Club and the Cul-
ture Club. Vincent holds a doctorate

TRIBUTE TO PAMELA MOSELEY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Pamela Moseley, the Lafay-

Lafayette Elementary School in Mayo, 
FL. 
Pamela was presented with this im-
portant recognition by Lafayette Ele-
mentary School’s principal, Stephen 
Clark, 
and 
Superintendent 
Robby 
Edwards. They were accompanied by 
her husband, Ralee, and their three 
children, Lilli, Mallory, and Trevor. 
During 
these 
unprecedented 
times, 
Pamela’s inspiration comes from her 
students, their reactions to connec-
tions, and their willingness to look for 
them. 
Pamela’s ability to adapt her edu-
cation style to her students ensures 
they are able to learn at their personal 
pace. She is always there for her stu-
dents, providing extra tutoring if they 
are having trouble learning new sub-
jects. 
Pamela has been a teacher for 17 
years and has taught fifth grade at La-
fayette Elementary School for the past 
4 years. 
I extend my best wishes to Pamela 
for her dedication to teaching and look 
forward to hearing of her continued 
good work in the years ahead.∑

TRIBUTE TO SALLIE MURPHY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to recognize Sallie Murphy, 
the Gadsden County Teacher of the 
Year 
from 
Greensboro 
Elementary 
School in Quincy, FL. 
Sallie always wanted to make a dif-
ference in the lives of children. If she is 
able to do that each day, it makes her 
want to come to school and work with 
a smile on her face. Her students de-
scribe her as a great teacher, and they 
appreciate her help in understanding 
what they are reading. 
Sallie teaches third grade at Greens-
boro Elementary School. She is in her 
7th year of teaching. Sallie’s mother, 
Patsy, was also a teacher at the same 
school for 33 years and knew Sallie 
would be a great teacher. 
I offer my sincere gratitude to Sallie 
for her dedication to her students. I 
look forward to hearing of her contin-
ued good work in the years to come.∑

∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I

Allapattah 
Flats 
principal 
Ana 
Rodriguez-Oronoz 
previously 
taught 
Melissa as a student in her fifth grade 
class at White City Elementary School. 
Now, as a teacher herself, Principal 
Rodriguez-Oronoz noted that Melissa 
knows each of her students’ unique 
strengths and understands her place in 
the classroom as their coach and men-
tor. 
Melissa works with her students each 
day to complete their assignments and 
ensure they understand the topics cov-
ered. She tutors students during lunch 
and after school and provides them 
with incentives and rewards to cele-
brate their accomplishments, believing 
this helps to make her instructions 
more effective. 
Melissa teaches eighth grade algebra 
at Allapattah Flats K–8 and previously 
worked as a data specialist. She is a 
graduate of St. Lucie Public Schools 
and has taught within the district

dents. I look forward to hearing of her 
continued good work in the years to

School in Madison, FL. 
Shaneika values lifelong relation-
ships with her students as an impor-
tant part of her role as an educator, es-
pecially 
during 
distance 
learning 
through these unprecedented times. 
She enjoys the opportunity to connect

Throughout Shaneika’s educational

share her educational experiences with 
both students and new teachers. 
Shaneika teaches fourth grade math

∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
honor Trikia White, the Leon County 
Teacher of the Year from Augusta Raa 
Middle School in Tallahassee, FL. 
Trikia believes receiving this impor-
tant recognition makes the long hours 
she spends grading assignments, pre-
paring lesson plans, and helping stu-
dents worth it. She enjoys seeing what 
her students can achieve after leaving 
her class. 
Trikia makes sure each minute of 
class time is worthwhile to her stu-
dents. She believes this is the only way 
for her to learn what they are capable 
of doing in her classroom, and it allows 
her to provide informal feedback to 
them. 
Trikia’s principal noted that she is

TRIBUTE TO NEAL ELLIOTT 
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to salute Neal Elliott for his 
many years of dedicated service and 
forward-looking 
leadership 
at 
the 
American Council for an Energy-Effi-
cient Economy, ACEEE. Neal will soon 
retire from his role as senior director 
for research, the capstone to a distin-
guished career at ACEEE that began in 
1993. An internationally recognized ex-
pert on energy efficiency, he has helped 
slash energy waste in the United 
States. Neal leaves a legacy worthy of 
our praise and gratitude. 
ACEEE is a nonprofit, nonpartisan 
organization that researches and ad-
vances energy efficiency policies, pro-
grams, technologies and behaviors as a 
way to strengthen the economy, reduce 
pollution, protect public health, and 
address climate change. Since its es-
tablishment in 1980, ACEEE has helped 
to mold U.S. policies that have cut do-
mestic energy use in half relative to 
the size of the U.S. economy and deliv-
ered more than $2,000 in annual savings 
per individual.

August 6, 2020 
Neal has been instrumental in that 
success. He has helped to grow not only 
ACEEE as an organization, which has 
more than tripled in size since his ar-
rival, but also the field of energy effi-
ciency. He oversees ACEEE’s overall 
research, which includes dozens of re-
ports, fact sheets, and topic briefs each 
year. He has spearheaded its work on 
industrial, 
agricultural, 
and 
rural 
issues, including on such topics as com-
bined heat and power—CHP—electric 
motor systems, smart energy manage-
ment, and industrial decarbonization. 
Neal helped coin the term ‘‘intelligent 
efficiency’’ to reflect the growing need 
to incorporate the Internet of Things, 
connected systems, and big data into 
energy-saving efforts. He was also a 
key player in the design of the rural 
energy programs in the 2002 farm bill 
that expanded into the Rural Energy 
for America Program in the 2008 farm 
bill. An expert on energy efficiency 
policies and programs, he has pushed to 
overcome market barriers to inte-
grating CHP and distributed energy re-
sources into a cleaner, intelligent 
power grid. He holds six patents in 
thermal storage and produce proc-
essing, has written dozens of articles 
and reports, and is a frequent speaker 
at domestic and international con-
ferences. 
Just as important, Neal has played a 
vital, avuncular role in expanding the 
energy efficiency community. He is 
adept at bringing people together and 
forging effective partnerships. With a 
doctorate degree in engineering from 
Duke University, where he previously 
taught, he has mentored and encour-
aged countless young professionals. He 
is passionate about energy efficiency, 
which he sees as a critical tool for re-
ducing greenhouse gas emissions, miti-
gating climate change, and securing a 
more hopeful tomorrow for future gen-
erations. 
Neal has been a stalwart friend to me 
and my staff. I am thankful for his 
leadership and ACEEE’s support for my 
proposals over the years. On behalf of 
the people of New Hampshire, I ask my 
colleagues and all Americans to join 
me in thanking Neal Elliott for his 
years of service and wishing him all 
the best in the years ahead.∑

REMEMBERING MANUEL CISNEROS 
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the life of Manuel 
‘‘Manny’’ Cisneros, a dedicated public 
servant and advocate for indigent and 
Latino communities across Arizona. 
Manny committed his life and career to 
community building and equal rights 
empowerment for Arizona’s most vul-
nerable. 
As a native of Somerton, AZ, Manny 
studied at Arizona Western College and 
went on to pursue a juris doctor degree 
at both Harvard University and the 
University 
of 
California 
Berkley 
School of Law where he received his 
juris doctor in 1984. Manny would serve 
as the coordinator of public health for 
the city of San Francisco, CA, before 
returning to Arizona to serve as the 
magistrate and assistant city manager 
of the city of San Luis. Under Arizona 
Governor Janet Napolitano, Manny 
was appointed to lead the Executive Of-
fice of Equal Opportunity. He would 
also serve as the director of the Gov-
ernor’s Fair Housing Office. Manny 
also dedicated a significant portion of 
his life to organizing and advocating 
for Latino voting, education, and fair 
housing rights. He served as chairman 
of the Maricopa County Democratic 
Party and as a delegate to the 1996 and 
2000 National Democratic Conventions. 
I had the pleasure of working with 
Manny during the early years of my ca-
reer and I was always impressed by his 
kindness and dedication to ensuring 
every Arizona family had access to af-
fordable and safe housing. As a humble 
public servant and Latino rights cham-
pion, the impact Manny has left in our 
hearts, his community, and our State 
will be felt for generations to come. His 
wife Beatriz and sons Jose and Daniel 
will be in my thoughts. Please join me 
in 
honoring 
the 
life

Manny 
Cisneros.∑

REMEMBERING MICHAEL MCQUAID 
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the life of Michael 
McQuaid, an established figure of the 
Phoenix business community and a de-
termined philanthropist dedicated to 
reducing homelessness in central Ari-
zona. 
Michael’s work to end homelessness 
began nearly three decades ago when 
he and his sons completed a commu-
nity service project to serve meals to 
the homeless at the Andre House of 
Hospitality. He eventually became the 
group’s first chairman of the board. In 
2003, Michael combined his desire to al-
leviate the chronic homelessness in Ar-
izona with his experience as a commer-
cial real estate developer and president 
of JP Management to oversee construc-
tion of the Human Services Campus in 
Phoenix, a national model for holistic 
homelessness services. He went on to 
serve as the managing director of the 
campus and as president of its board of 
directors. Over the years, Michael also 
served on the boards of Maricopa Coun-
ty Association of Governments, MAG, 
Continuum of Care, the Lodestar Day 
Resource Center, the Arizona Housing 
Commission, the Valley of the Sun 
United Way’s Ending Homelessness Ad-
visory Council, Experience Matters, 
and Thunderbird Charities, among oth-
ers. In 2010, Michael was recognized by 
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer with the 
State of Arizona’s Lifetime Volunteer 
Award. In 2013, he was awarded the 
first Virginia G. Piper Trust Encore 
Career Award for his efforts to address 
homelessness in Maricopa County. 
Michael established a legacy of serv-
ice in central Arizona that others will 
undoubtedly seek to match. I am cer-
tain that the love he shared for his fel-
low Arizonans will be felt for many 
years to come. Please join me in hon-
oring the life of Michael McQuaid.∑

REMEMBERING HUMBERTO 
TRUJILLO, JR. 
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the life of Postmaster 
Humberto Trujillo Jr., ‘‘Junior’’. He 
was a beloved leader, coach, and Post-
master. Junior served others with dedi-
cation, and his impact will be felt for 
generations. 
Junior grew up in West Phoenix, 
where he attended Edison Elementary 
School and East High School. He was 
an avid athlete and went on to attend 
Phoenix College, where he played foot-
ball, and spent over a decade coaching 
sports to the children in the commu-
nity. Junior first worked for the postal 
service as a masonry foreman who 
helped construct the Phoenix Main 
Post Office. As a 31-year veteran of the 
Postal Service, Junior used his skill 
and expertise to rise through the ranks 
of the service. In 2015, Junior accepted 
the position of Phoenix Postmaster, 
leading the staff of the same post office 
he helped build many years ago. 
Junior will be deeply missed by his 
family and the community who shared 
in his love. Please join me in honoring 
the life and service of Postmaster 
Humberto Trujillo, Jr.∑

S. 4502. A bill to amend the Natural

provide for greater public input oppor-

S5275 
August 6, 2020 
make the process of siting natural gas 
pipelines fairer, more transparent, and 
more responsive to landowner con-
cerns. 
For some time now, I have been lis-
tening to Virginians with passionate 
views on the process involved in per-
mitting the Atlantic Coast and Moun-
tain Valley Pipelines. For various rea-
sons, many oppose one or both of these 
projects while others support these 
projects. The Federal Energy Regu-
latory Commission, FERC, is tasked 
with analyzing all the issues—purpose 
and need for a project, impacts on peo-
ple 1iving on the route, potential risks 
to the environment or property—and 
deciding what course best serves the 
public interest. 
From listening to all sides, I have 
concluded that while reasonable people 
may 
reach 
different 
conclusions, 
FERC’s public input process is flawed 
and could be better. Accordingly, this 
legislation proposes several steps to ad-
dress 
several 
shortcomings, 
all 
of 
which were originally brought to my 
attention by Virginia constituents. For 
instance, 
this 
bill 
requires 
pro-
grammatic analysis of pipelines pro-
posed around the same time and in the 
same geographic vicinity so that the 
full impacts of multiple projects can be 
analyzed. It requires a greater number 
of public comment meetings so that 
citizens are not required to commute 
long distances to meetings at which 
they must speed through just a few 
minutes of remarks on these complex 
topics. It ensures that affected land-
owners are given proper notice and 
compensation. It guarantees that land-
owner complaints will be heard before 
construction commences. And it clari-
fies the circumstances under which 
eminent domain should and should not 
be used. 
I am pleased to be joined by my col-
league Senator MARK WARNER on this 
bill, which is an update to a version we 
introduced in the 115th Congress. The 
public deserves reasonable opportunity 
to weigh in on energy infrastructure 
projects, and we are heeding calls by 
our constituents to make this process 
fairer and more transparent without 
mandating a particular outcome. 
I encourage the Senate to consider 
this legislation, not to pave the way 
for pipelines nor to throw up insur-
mountable roadblocks to them, but to 
give the public greater certainty that 
the federal government’s infrastruc-
ture decisions are fair and transparent. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Mr. PETERS): 
S. 4504. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to expand the 
availability of medical nutrition ther-
apy services under the Medicare pro-
gram; to the Committee on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleague from Michi-
gan, Senator PETERS, in introducing 
legislation to expand Medicare bene-
ficiaries’ access to Medical Nutrition 
Therapy, or MNT, which is a cost-effec-
tive component of treatment for obe-
sity, 
diabetes, 
hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and other chronic condi-
tions. At a time when we are seeing 
many diet-related chronic conditions 
contribute to poor COVID–19 outcomes, 
increasing access to MNT should be 
part of the strategy to improve disease 
management and prevention for Amer-
ica’s seniors. Our legislation, the Med-
ical Nutrition Therapy Act of 2020, 
would make two important changes to 
support patients, improve health out-
comes, 
and 
reduce 
unnecessary 
healthcare costs. 
First, it would expand Medicare Part 
B coverage of outpatient medical nu-
trition therapy services to a number of 
currently uncovered diseases or condi-
tions—including prediabetes, obesity, 
high blood pressure, high cholesterol, 
malnutrition, eating disorders, cancer, 
celiac disease, and HIV/AIDS. Cur-
rently, Medicare Part B only covers 
outpatient MNT for diabetes, renal dis-
ease, and post-kidney transplant. Sec-
ond, the bill would allow more types of 
providers—including 
nurse 
practi-
tioners, physician assistants, clinical 
nurse specialists, and psychologists—to 
refer patients to MNT. This is espe-
cially critical for a rural State like 
Maine, where a NP or PA may be one’s 
trusted primary care provider. 
MNT counseling is provided by reg-
istered dietitian nutritionists, RDNs, 
as part of a collaborative healthcare 
team. It is evidenced-based and proven 
to positively impact weight, blood 
pressure, blood lipids, and blood sugar 
control, and nutritional counseling by 
RDNs is even recommended by the Na-
tional Lipid Association to promote 
long-term adherence to an individual-
ized, heart-healthy diet. Through MNT, 
individuals benefit from in-depth indi-
vidualized nutrition assessments and 
trusted followup visits for the repeated 
reinforcement necessary to aid with be-
havior and lifestyle changes. 
Seniors deserve improved access to 
this cost-effective medical treatment, 
but many older adults are missing out 
under the current Medicare policy. 
Marcy Kyle, a RDN from Rockport, 
ME, shared numerous stories of pa-
tients being denied access to medically 
necessary MNT that illustrate why this 
legislation is needed. In one story, a 
patient with prediabetes was referred 
by his primary care physician for MNT 
at age 64. At that time, his private in-
surance covered the service and he 
booked the first available appointment 
the following week. But this patient 
turned 65 that week and transitioned 
onto Medicare. You can imagine his 
surprise upon arriving for his appoint-
ment that MNT would not be covered. 
While the outpatient facility changed 
its process after this case in order to 
prevent similar situations, it dem-
onstrates how the current restrictions 
are detrimental for older adults at a 
critical juncture in their health jour-
ney. 
Another example from Maine was a 
patient with a new diagnosis of celiac 
disease complicated by severe weight 
loss. His private insurance covered 
MNT as celiac disease is a very control-
lable disease with proper nutrition. But 
when transitioning from private insur-
ance to Medicare, this patient lost his 
opportunity for MNT. We know that 
early treatment with MNT can prevent 
future and more serious health com-
plications and chronic conditions in 
older adults, and conditions such as 
prediabetes and celiac disease should 
be covered. 
The 
health 
and 
financial 
crisis 
brought on by the COVID–19 pandemic 
makes access to MNT even more im-
portant. Seniors with diet-related con-
ditions are suffering more than any 
other population in terms of the worst 
health outcomes, including death. Data 
from the Centers for Medicare & Med-
icaid Services, CMS, in June confirmed 
elevated risk for seniors with under-
lying health conditions. Among those 
hospitalized with COVID–19, 79 percent 
of patients had hypertension, 60 per-
cent had hyperlipidemia, 50 percent of 
patients either presented with chronic 
kidney disease or diabetes. Tragically, 
of those hospitalized, 28 percent were 
never able to leave the hospital be-
cause they passed away. 
In addition to the significant health 
impacts, 
the 
economic 
impact 
of 
chronic diseases is staggering. Accord-
ing to the U.S. Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, 90 percent of the 
$3.5 trillion the United States spends 
annually on health care goes to the 
treatment of people with chronic dis-
eases and mental health conditions. 
Preventing chronic diseases, or man-
aging symptoms when prevention is 
not possible, is one way to reduce these 
costs. This is particularly important 
for the Medicare Program as more than 
two-thirds of seniors on Medicare live 
with multiple chronic conditions. As 
one registered dietition nutritionist in 
Maine told me, ‘‘We all know a dollar 
spent on prevention saves many health 
care dollars in the long run and is the 
right thing to do for our seniors at a 
time when they have limited budgets.’’ 
The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act 
of 2020 is supported by more than 30 na-
tional 
organizations, 
including 
the 
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 
the American Diabetes Association, 
the Endocrine Society, the American 
Cancer Society Cancer Action Net-
work, and the National Kidney Foun-
dation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation to improve ac-
cess to cost-effective medical treat-
ment for Medicare patients with chron-
ic diseases. 
By Ms. SMITH: 
S. 4466. A bill to authorize the Attor-
ney General to make grants to improve 
public safety, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on the Judiciary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5276 
August 6, 2020 
step on the path towards racial justice 
in this country. The challenges in de-
feating systemic racism can seem in-
surmountable, but there are clear next 
steps. 
We need to start by transforming our 
policing system to root out the sys-
temic racism and the culture of vio-
lence that is killing Black and Brown 
and indigenous people and people of 
color. 
I want to talk today about four areas 
of this work that need our urgent at-
tention. 
First, we need to bring justice, ac-
countability, and change to police de-
partments by passing the Justice in 
Policing Act. 
Second, we need to invest in new 
models of public safety by supporting 
community-led reform and innovation. 
I am asking the Senate to take up and 
pass my new bill to do just that. 
Third, we need to end the criminal-
ization of poverty, which happens when 
other social systems fail. 
Finally, we need to root out racism 
in 
our 
systems 
of 
education, 
healthcare, housing, and economic op-
portunity so that everyone in this 
country can have the freedom and the 
opportunity to build the lives they 
choose. 
In order to bring justice, account-
ability, and change to policing depart-
ments around the country, we need to 
start by passing the Justice in Policing 
Act. Led by Senator BOOKER and Sen-
ator HARRIS, this bill is a comprehen-
sive set of needed Federal-level reforms 
to a system that is designed to shield 
police officers from accountability and 
consequences and denies justice to vic-
tims of police violence. 
These reforms—like ending qualified 
immunity, establishing a national use- 
of-force standard, creating a registry of 
police misconduct, and banning dan-
gerous practices like choke holds and 
no-knock warrants—are long overdue. 
Indeed, communities and activists 
have pushed for many of the reforms in 
this bill for decades. A few weeks ago, 
I spoke on this floor about the urgent 
need to pass this bill. Unfortunately, 
this critical legislation is still sitting 
on Leader MCCONNELL’s desk. But I 
promise that I will keep fighting until 
the Justice in Policing Act is signed 
into law. 
Policing needs other changes, too, 
like banning so-called warrior training, 
which encourages law enforcement offi-
cials to see the public as hostile en-
emies. We need to empower the Civil 
Rights Division of the Department of 
Justice to independently investigate 
police departments that systematically 
violate the constitutional rights of our 
communities. 
We need to reform Federal sen-
tencing to repeal 1994 crime bill provi-
sions, like mandatory minimums and 
draconian sentencing enhancements, 
and we need to prohibit police union 
contracts that create unfair barriers to 
effective investigations, civilian over-
sight, and holding police departments 
accountable to the communities they 
are sworn to serve. 
In our work to transform policing, 
the second step we need to take at the 
Federal level is to support local com-
munity-led innovation in public safety. 
Although Congress has the responsi-
bility to establish national standards 
for justice and accountability, Federal- 
level change can only go so far. State, 
local, and Tribal governments are re-
sponsible for overseeing policing in 
their communities. I believe that these 
communities know best what will work 
in their own cities and towns. The Fed-
eral Government, though, can play a 
catalytic role by supporting and fund-
ing innovative, anti-racist policing re-
form. 
With this in mind, today I am intro-
ducing a bill, the Supporting Innova-
tion and Public Safety Act, which 
would help State, local, and Tribal gov-
ernments reimagine policing in their 
communities by funding innovative 
projects and best practices that will 
transform how we deliver public safety 
and other social services. 
My bill would empower local govern-
ments 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
projects 
to 
improve 
public 
safety 
through systemic change, not just by 
growing police department budgets. 
There are great examples of innova-
tion already happening. Local jurisdic-
tions are experimenting with new ways 
to provide mental health crisis re-
sponse. They are addressing ways of 
dealing with gun violence as a public 
health issue and even how to enforce 
low-level traffic safety violations with-
out involving an armed police officer. 
I have long believed that those who 
are closest to the work know best how 
to get the work done. Through these 
grants from the Federal level, we will 
be able to help local communities 
adopt new approaches to public safety, 
tailoring their needs and unique cir-
cumstances to what they need to do. 
Then we can develop robust evaluation 
of these community-led projects, which 
will generate new data and new models 
of public safety in policing and also 
sow the seeds of progress and broad 
transformation. 
The third thing we need to do at all 
levels of government is to work to-
gether to stop criminalizing poverty 
and using the criminal justice system 
as the solution for every social ill. 
For decades, we have dramatically 
underfunded efforts to support housing, 
mental health, and substance abuse. 
And then we criminalize the results of 
this lack of support. We ask police de-
partments to control behavior like loi-
tering or trespassing, public intoxica-
tion, and public nuisances—all offenses 
that largely don’t threaten public safe-
ty. Then we put people in jail because 
they have a mental illness or lack a 
safe place to live. Poverty becomes the 
reason why people, especially people of 
color, get caught up in the criminal 
justice system. 
It is time that we stop criminalizing 
poverty and start investing in solu-
tions to get to the root causes of social 
problems. We need to refocus policing 
on violence prevention and crisis re-
sponse, which connects people to the 
services that they need. 
A good place to start is by dramati-
cally reforming cash bail so that those 
who haven’t been convicted of a crime 
don’t remain in jail just because they 
can’t afford bail. Almost 60 percent of 
the nearly 750,000 people currently in 
jail have not been convicted of any 
crime. They are in jail just because 
they cannot afford bail, and the data 
tells us that this is yet another burden 
that falls disproportionately on com-
munities of color. 
Indeed, when we criminalize poverty, 
we facilitate the systemic racist har-
assment, surveillance, and control of 
Black and Brown, and indigenous com-
munities. That is why we need to ban 
the use of quotas for law enforcement 
officers to enforce so-called broken 
windows offenses. These offenses do not 
threaten public safety, and they are 
disproportionately enforced on commu-
nities of color. 
A recent New York Times investiga-
tion found that in many large police 
departments, serious violent crimes 
make up only about 1 percent of all 
calls for service—1 percent. Many of 
those same departments are solving 
less than 30 percent of those serious 
crimes. We could actually improve pub-
lic safety by devoting resources to 
combating violent crime rather than 
overenforcing 
low-level 
offenses 
in 
communities of color. 
Let’s think about what this means 
for marijuana offenses. The Federal 
marijuana prohibition is a failed policy 
that contributes to mass incarceration 
and overpolicing of communities of 
color. White and Black people use 
marijuana at roughly the same rate, 
but a Black person is almost four times 
as likely to be arrested for a marijuana 
offense. 
The Federal Government is behind 
both State law and public opinion. 
Forty-two States and the District of 
Columbia already allow some type of 
marijuana use, despite the long-time 
Federal prohibition. 
It is time to legalize marijuana, and 
we should do it in a practical and com-
monsense way that protects the health 
and safety and the civil rights of our 
communities. 
We need to take up and pass Senator 
HARRIS’s Marijuana Opportunity Rein-
vestment and Expungement Act, the 
MORE Act, which I am proud to co-
sponsor. The MORE Act would address 
the devastating impact on commu-
nities of color on the War on Drugs by 
expunging marijuana-related convic-
tions and reinvesting in community. 
Also, I recently introduced a bill, the 
Substance Resolution and Safety Act, 
which would ensure that marijuana is 
regulated to protect the health and the 
safety of youth, of consumers, and of 
drivers. We do this without replicating 
the racist enforcement patterns of our 
current drug policy.

August 6, 2020 
Finally, we need to recognize that ra-
cial justice is not only about policing 
and criminal justice reform. We need 
to root out racist policies that are 
built into our systems of housing, 
healthcare, education, and economic 
opportunity. 
The legacy of slavery, of oppression, 
and of discrimination is pervasive in 
these areas and our communities bear 
the scars of these past crimes even as 
new injuries accumulate. This is why a 
Black or a Brown child living in the 
neighborhood where George Floyd was 
murdered has fewer opportunities than 
a White child living just a few miles 
away. 
The impact of generations of stolen 
labor, of systemic violence, and exclu-
sion 
from 
opportunity 
is 
revealed 
today in legal disparities, achievement 
gaps, housing instability, and the dra-
matic difference in wealth and wages 
between White people and people of 
color. 
Addressing these challenges are cru-
cial to the unfinished work of racial 
justice in our country. This means that 
we need to implement anti-racist prac-
tices and policies, like ending the use 
of armed police officers in schools, 
eliminating discipline disparities, and 
shutting off the school-to-prison pipe-
line. It means addressing the systemic 
exclusion of Black and Brown and in-
digenous people from the wealth-build-
ing opportunities of homeownership. It 
means tackling the root causes of ra-
cial health disparities, including envi-
ronmental injustices and discrimina-
tion in healthcare. It means supporting 
economic opportunity for all by remov-
ing racist barriers to employment, en-
trepreneurship, credit, and capital. 
The scale of the injustice that we see 
in our country can sometimes feel 
overwhelming, and the path can seem 
very long. These are some concrete 
steps that we can take on that path, 
and they are necessary steps, to fulfill 
our country’s promise of freedom and 
equity for all of us. Community leaders 
and activists are showing us the path 
forward, and following this path re-
quires us to be courageous, requires us 
to be humble, and, at times, requires us 
to be uncomfortable. But it is a path 
rooted in love and trust and hope.

(2) AMERICA’S
CLEAN
FUTURE
FUND.—The 
Secretary shall carry out this section using 
amounts made available from the America’s 
Clean Future Fund under section 4. 
SEC. 8. STUDY ON CARBON PRICING. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than January 1, 
2024, the Administrator of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency (referred to in 
this section as the ‘‘Administrator’’) shall 
seek to enter into an agreement with the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences under which the 
National Academy of Sciences shall carry 
out a study not less frequently than once 
every 5 years to evaluate the effectiveness of 
the fees established under sections 4692 and 
4693 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in 
achieving the following goals: 
(1) A net reduction of greenhouse gas emis-
sions by 45 percent, based on 2018 levels, by 
2030. 
(2) A net reduction of greenhouse gas emis-
sions by 100 percent, based on 2018 levels, by 
2050. 
(b) REQUIREMENTS.—In executing the agree-
ment under subsection (a), the Adminis-
trator shall ensure that, in carrying out a 
study under that subsection, the National 
Academy of Sciences— 
(1) includes an evaluation of— 
(A) total annual greenhouse gas emissions 
by the United States, including greenhouse 
gas emissions not subject to the fees de-
scribed in that subsection; and 
(B) the historic trends in the total green-
house gas emissions evaluated under sub-

(2) analyzes the extent to which green-
house gas emissions have been or would be 
reduced as a result of current and potential 
future policies, including— 
(A) a projection of greenhouse gas emis-
sions reductions that would result if the reg-
ulations of the Administrator were to be ad-
justed to impose stricter limits on green-
house gas emissions than the goals described 
in that subsection, with a particular focus on 
greenhouse gas emissions not subject to the 
fees described in that subsection;

sions reductions that would result if fees 
charged under such sections were annually 
increased— 
(i) at the current price path; and 
(ii) above the current price path; 
(D) an analysis of greenhouse gas emis-
sions reductions that result from the policies 
of States, units of local government, Tribal 
communities, and the private sector;

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
The amendments made by this Act shall 
apply to any calendar year beginning after 
December 31, 2021. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. GRASSLEY): 
S. 4491. A bill to designate meth-
amphetamine as an emerging threat, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
psychostimulant overdose deaths, in-
cluding 
methamphetamine-related 
deaths, increased by 27 percent in 1 
year. That is a higher rate of increase 
than any other illicit substance in our 
country, including fentanyl. 
It is time to sound the alarm. We 
must take immediate action to prevent 
methamphetamine from becoming the 
next drug overdose crisis facing our 
country. 
That is why I am introducing the 
Methamphetamine Response Act with 
my colleague, Senator GRASSLEY. 
This bill does two things. 
First, it declares methamphetamine 
an emerging drug threat. 
Second, it requires the Office of Na-
tional Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, to 
develop and implement a national plan 
that is specific to methamphetamine, 
in accordance the ONDCP Reauthoriza-
tion, which I was proud to coauthor, 
and which was enacted in 2018 as part 
of the SUPPORT Act. 
This plan must include an assess-
ment of the methamphetamine threat, 
including the current availability of, 
and demand for, the drug, and the ef-
fectiveness of evidence-based preven-
tion and treatment programs, as well 
as law enforcement programs; short- 
and long-term goals focused on supply 
and demand reduction and the expan-
sion of prevention and treatment pro-
grams; performance measures related 
to the plan’s goals; and the level of 
funding needed to implement the plan, 
including an assessment of whether 
available funding can be reprogrammed 
or transferred or whether additional 
funds are needed. 
There is no question that meth-
amphetamine is emerging yet again as 
a major drug threat to our Nation. 
Between 2008 and 2017, methamphet-
amine-related 
treatment 
admissions 
increased from 15 percent to nearly 24 
percent. Heroin use among those ad-
mitted for methamphetamine treat-
ment increased from 5.3 percent to 23.6 
percent, indicating a significant and 
troubling increase in poly substance 
use. 
Between 
2018 
and 
2019, 
psychostimulant overdose deaths, in-
cluding methamphetamine deaths, in-
creased in 27 of the 38 states that pro-
vide drug-specific data to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
This amounts to a 27-percent increase 
nationally. 
By the end of 2019, methamphetamine 
availability, use, purity, and potency 
had increased, as street level prices de-
clined. 
Data shows that methamphetamine 
use is no longer limited to Midwest and 
Western States but is increasingly 
prevalent in Northeastern States. 
Emergency room admissions for sus-
pected stimulant overdoses, including 
methamphetamine, increased by 23 per-
cent between January 2019 and 2020. 
These increases occurred in 36 States 
and the District of Colombia. 
In the first 9 months of fiscal year 
2020, methamphetamine seizures in-
creased by 52 percent. 
COVID–19 is likely to exacerbate 
these trends. 
In fact, the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse has warned clinicians to be 
prepared to monitor adverse effects as-
sociated with increased methamphet-
amine use, including respiratory and 
pulmonary effects, among COVID–19 
patients. 
Additionally, the necessary social 
distancing 
requirements 
associated 
with COVID–19 have made in-person 
treatment more difficult, increasing 
the probability that those seeking 
treatment may not be able to access it. 
These facts alone are enough to de-
clare methamphetamine an emerging 
threat, but public reports indicating 
that Mexican cartels are stockpiling 
methamphetamine at the border and 
are poised to flood the United States 
with methamphetamine make the situ-
ation that much more urgent. 
In 1 year methamphetamine killed 
more than 16,000 Americans. Absent 
immediate action and a whole-of-gov-
ernment plan, these fatalities will con-
tinue to increase. 
Please join me in supporting Meth-
amphetamine Response Act to stop 
methamphetamine from becoming the 
next wave in a series of preventable 
crises that have impacted the United 
States. 
By Mr. SCHUMER: 
S. 4496. A bill to direct the Secretary 
of Labor to promulgate an occupa-
tional safety and health standard that 
requires covered employers to protect 
employees from injury and death re-
lated to grease trap manholes; to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4496 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bryce 
Raynor Act of 2020’’.

common health problem among women and 
girls involving a hormonal imbalance; 
Whereas there is no universal definition of 
PCOS, but researchers estimate that be-
tween 5,000,000 and 10,000,000 women in the 
United States are affected by the condition; 
Whereas, according to a 2004 study, the an-
nual burden of PCOS in the United States is 
an estimated $4,360,000,000, and this figure 
pertains to only the reproductive years of 
women and does not consider the cost of 
other comorbidities, including obstetrical 
complications, or the cost of metabolic 
morbidities in post-menopause or adoles-
cence; 
Whereas PCOS can affect girls at the onset 
of puberty and throughout the remainder of 
their lives; 
Whereas the symptoms of PCOS include in-
fertility, irregular or absent menstrual peri-
ods, acne, weight gain, thinning of scalp 
hair, excessive facial and body hair growth, 
numerous small ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, 
and mental health problems; 
Whereas women with PCOS have higher 
rates of psychosocial disorders, including de-
pression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and eat-
ing disorders, and are at greater risk for sui-
cide; 
Whereas adolescents with PCOS often are 
not diagnosed, and many have metabolic 
dysfunction and insulin resistance, which 
can lead to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
non-
alcoholic 
fatty 
liver 
disease, 
and 
endometrial cancer at a young adult age; 
Whereas PCOS is the most common cause 
of female infertility; 
Whereas PCOS in pregnancy is associated 
with increased risk of gestational diabetes, 
preeclampsia, 
pregnancy-induced 
hyper-
tension, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, 
miscarriage, and fetal and infant death; 
Whereas women with PCOS are at in-
creased risk of developing high blood pres-
sure, high cholesterol, stroke, and heart dis-
ease (the leading cause of death among 
women); 
Whereas women with PCOS have a more 
than 50 percent chance of developing type 2 
diabetes or prediabetes before the age of 40; 
Whereas women with PCOS may be at a 
higher risk for breast cancer and ovarian 
cancer, 
and 
their 
risk 
for 
developing 
endometrial cancer is 3 times higher than 
women who do not have PCOS; 
Whereas research has found genetic evi-
dence of a causal link between depression 
and PCOS; 
Whereas research has indicated PCOS 
shares a genetic architecture with metabolic 
traits, as evidenced by genetic correlations 
between PCOS and obesity, fasting insulin, 
type 2 diabetes, lipid levels, and coronary ar-
tery disease; 
Whereas adolescents with PCOS are at 
markedly increased risk for type 2 diabetes, 
fatty liver disease, and heart disease; 
Whereas PCOS negatively alters metabolic 
function independent of, but exacerbated by, 
an increased body mass index (BMI); 
Whereas an estimated 50 percent of women 
with PCOS are undiagnosed, and many re-
main undiagnosed until they experience fer-
tility difficulties or develop type 2 diabetes 
or other cardiometabolic disorders; 
Whereas the cause of PCOS is unknown, 
but researchers have found strong links to a 
genetic predisposition and significant insulin 
resistance, which affects up to 70 percent of 
women with PCOS; and 
Whereas there is no known cure for PCOS: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes polycystic ovary syndrome 
(in this resolution referred to as ‘‘PCOS’’) as 
a serious disorder that impacts many aspects 
of health, including cardiometabolic, repro-
ductive, and mental health, and quality of 
life; 
(2) expresses support for the designation of 
September 
2020 
as 
‘‘PCOS 
Awareness 
Month’’; 
(3) supports the goals and ideals of PCOS 
Awareness Month, which are— 
(A) to increase awareness of, and education 
about, 
PCOS 
and 
its 
connection 
to 
comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, 
endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and mental 
health disorders, among the general public, 
women, girls, and health care professionals; 
(B) to improve diagnosis and treatment of 
PCOS; 
(C) to disseminate information on diag-
nosis, treatment, and management of PCOS, 
including prevention of comorbidities such 
as type 2 diabetes, endometrial cancer, car-
diovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease, and eating disorders; and 
(D) to improve quality of life and outcomes 
for women and girls with PCOS; 
(4) recognizes the need for further research, 
improved treatment and care options, and a 
cure for PCOS; 
(5) acknowledges the struggles affecting all 
women and girls afflicted with PCOS in the 
United States; 
(6) urges medical researchers and health 
care professionals to advance their under-
standing of PCOS to improve research, diag-
nosis, and treatment of PCOS for women and 
girls; and 
(7) encourages States, territories, and lo-
calities to support the goals and ideals of 
PCOS Awareness Month.

S. RES. 671 
Whereas the passage of the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 marked a historic point in the on-
going struggle to achieve political equality, 
end racial discrimination, and enforce the 
voting rights guarantees enshrined in the 
14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitu-

support of voting rights were attacked and 
savagely beaten by State troopers and local 
lawmen; 
Whereas, on March 15, 1965, President Lyn-

man’s unending search for freedom. So it was 
at Lexington and Concord. So it was a cen-
tury ago at Appomattox. So it was last week 
in Selma, Alabama. . . . There is no cause for 
pride in what has happened in Selma. There 
is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long 
denial of equal rights of millions of Ameri-
cans. But there is cause for hope and for 
faith in our democracy in what is happening 
here tonight. . . . Experience has clearly 
shown that the existing process of law can-
not overcome systematic and ingenious dis-
crimination. No law that we now have on the 
books—and I have helped to put 3 of them 
there—can ensure the right to vote when 
local officials are determined to deny it. . . . 
Wednesday, I will send to Congress a law de-
signed to eliminate illegal barriers to the 
right to vote. . . . This bill will strike down 
restrictions to voting in all elections—Fed-
eral, State, and local—which have been used 
to deny [Blacks] the right to vote.’’; 
Whereas a bipartisan Congress approved 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and on August 
6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed 
this landmark legislation into law; 
Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ef-
fectuates the permanent guarantee of the 
15th Amendment that ‘‘the right of citizens 
of the United States to vote shall not be de-
nied or abridged by the United States or by 
any State on account of race, color, or pre-
vious condition of servitude’’; 
Whereas, according to the Congressional 
Research Service, the Voting Rights Act had 
‘‘an immediate and dramatic impact’’, and 
within 4 years of its passage, nearly 1,000,000 
Black voters were registered, including over 
50 percent of the Black voting age population 
in every southern State; 
Whereas, after the 1966 elections, the num-
ber of Black elected officials in the South 
more than doubled, from 72 to 159; 
Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
stands as a landmark legislative achieve-
ment and pays tribute to the heroism of all 
those who fought to fulfill the promises 
guaranteed to them by the 14th and 15th 
Amendments, especially those whose blood 
was spilled and whose lives were lost; 
Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has 
been extended and amended 5 times; 
Whereas, despite progress from 55 years of 
enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965, voting rights are still under attack in 
the United States; 
Whereas, in its decision in Shelby County 
v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013), the Supreme 
Court of the United States struck down sec-
tion 4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which 
required covered States and jurisdictions 
with a history of discriminatory voting prac-
tices 
to 
submit 
voting 
changes 
for 
‘‘preclearance’’ before they could take effect; 
Whereas, since the decision in Shelby Coun-
ty, many States have passed discriminatory 
voting laws that have made it more difficult 
for people of color and low income individ-
uals to vote; 
Whereas it is vital to democracy in the 
United States that the provisions of the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 are fully effective to 
prevent discrimination and dilution of the 
equal rights of minority voters; and 
Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has 
been widely hailed as the single most impor-
tant civil rights law passed in the history of 
the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes, commemorates, and cele-
brates the 55th anniversary of the enactment 
of the Voting Rights Act of 1965;

SENATE RESOLUTION 672—DESIG-
NATING SEPTEMBER 2020 AS NA-
TIONAL DEMOCRACY MONTH AS 
A TIME TO REFLECT ON THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE SYSTEM 
OF 
GOVERNMENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
TO 
A 
MORE 
FREE AND STABLE WORLD 
Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
S. RES. 672 
Whereas, 2,000 years after the ancient 
Greeks laid the groundwork for democracy, 
the founders of the United States built an 
even greater system of government, a demo-
cratic republic, propelling the United States 
to become the most advanced nation in 
human history; 
Whereas the model of government of the 
United States has been reproduced around 
the world; 
Whereas, according to Freedom House, 
more than 1 in 3 people in the world do not 
live in states considered free; 
Whereas the Constitution of the United 
States and the Bill of Rights, with the addi-
tion of the Reconstruction Era amendments, 
including the 14th and 15th Amendments, 
and the 19th Amendment, enshrine the rights 
and civil liberties of citizens of the United 
States, including the right to vote in free 
and fair elections; 
Whereas the perpetuation of the ideals of 
democracy does not happen on its own and 
can be stalled or reversed; 
Whereas surveys show that citizens of the 
United States are losing faith in the demo-
cratic system; 
Whereas former Supreme Court Justice 
Sandra Day O’Connor said, ‘‘The practice of 
democracy is not passed down through the 
gene pool. It must be taught and learned 
anew by each generation of citizens.’’; 
Whereas President John F. Kennedy said, 
‘‘Democracy is never a final achievement. It 
is a call to untiring effort, to continual sac-
rifice and to the willingness, if necessary, to 
die in its defense.’’; 
Whereas President Ronald Reagan said, 
‘‘Democracy is worth dying for, because it’s 
the most deeply honorable form of govern-
ment ever devised by man.’’; 
Whereas World War II demonstrated the 
fragility of democracy and the civilized life 
that accompanies democracy; 
Whereas British Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill observed that, ‘‘Indeed it has been 
said that democracy is the worst form of 
Government except for all those other forms 
that have been tried from time to time . . . 
.’’; 
Whereas President George Washington said 
the United States must recognize the im-
mense value of the national Union and work 
towards preservation of that Union with 
‘‘jealous anxiety’’ and wrote that the secu-
rity of a free Constitution may be accom-
plished by ‘‘teaching the people themselves 
to know and to value their own rights’’; 
Whereas 
President 
Thomas 
Jefferson 
wrote, ‘‘Educate and inform the whole mass 
of the people . . . . They are the only sure re-
liance for the preservation of our liberty.’’; 
and 
Whereas the Government of the United 
States must teach and educate the people by 
taking appropriate actions to highlight and 
emphasize the importance of democratic 
principles and the essential role of demo-
cratic principles in the freedoms and way of 
life enjoyed by the people of the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2020 as ‘‘National 
Democracy Month’’; 
(2) encourages States and local govern-
ments to designate September 2020 as ‘‘Na-
tional Democracy Month’’; 
(3) recognizes the celebration of ‘‘National 
Democracy Month’’ as a time to reflect on 
the contributions of the system of govern-
ment of the United States to a more free and 
stable world; and 
(4) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe ‘‘National Democracy 
Month’’ with appropriate ceremonies and ac-
tivities that— 
(A) provide appreciation for the system of 
government of the United States; and 
(B) demonstrate that the people of the 
United States shall never forget the sac-
rifices made by past generations of people of 
the United States to preserve the freedoms 
and principles of the United States.

HOLLEN, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. MERKLEY, 
Mr. DURBIN, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Ms. WAR-
REN, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. COONS, Ms. BALD-
WIN, Mr. WYDEN, Ms. HIRONO, Mr. MUR-
PHY, Mr. LEAHY, Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. 
SANDERS, and Ms. SMITH) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 673 
Whereas, on March 1, 2018, President Vladi-
mir 
Putin 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
previewed five new Russian nuclear delivery 
systems in his State of the Nation address; 
Whereas two of the new systems, the 
Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile 
(ICBM) and the Avangard hypersonic glide 
vehicle, will count under the limits of the 
Treaty between the United States of Amer-
ica and the Russian Federation on Measures 
for the Further Reduction and Limitation of 
Strategic Offensive Arms (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘New START Treaty’’), as 
confirmed by Sergey Lavrov, Foreign Min-
ister of the Russian Federation; 
Whereas an additional pair of new systems, 
the Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo and 
the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise mis-
sile, are not projected to be deployed during 
the five-year extension of the New START 
Treaty to 2026, and even if they were de-
ployed, the United States is able to address 
its concerns about those weapons through 
the Bilateral Consultative Committee; 
Whereas the Russian Federation’s fifth 
new system, the Kinzhal short-range air- 
launched ballistic missile, is being deployed 
as a theater-strike weapon on MiG-31 air-
craft, rather than on a heavy bomber, in 
which case it would be automatically ac-
countable under the New START Treaty; 
Whereas the advance timing of the Russian 
Federation’s nuclear modernization cycle 
may allow it to significantly expand its stra-
tegic nuclear arsenal relative to the United 
States in the event that the New START 
Treaty expires on February 5, 2021; 
Whereas the 2020 Annual Report on the Im-
plementation of the new START Treaty con-
cluded that the Russian Federation was ‘‘in 
compliance with the terms of the New 
START Treaty’’; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China has 
never entered into a treaty or agreement 
with the United States or any other party 
that places binding limits on its shorter- 
range, intermediate-, or strategic-range bal-
listic missiles, verified by National Tech-
nical Means and by on-site inspections, as 
the United States and Russian Federation 
did through the Intermediate-Range Nuclear 
Forces (INF) Treaty, the START I and 
START II Treaties, and the New START 
Treaty, each of which took multiple years to 
successfully negotiate; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China 
possesses significantly fewer ICBMs, sub-
marine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), 
and heavy bombers than the Russian Federa-
tion or the United States, and according to 
the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Chi-
na’s warhead stockpile is in the ‘‘the low 
couple of hundreds’’, a fraction of the size of 
the arsenals of the Russian Federation and 
the United States; and 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China has 
repeatedly 
declined 
invitations 
by 
the 
United States to enter into trilateral nego-
tiations on an arms control treaty or other 
agreement regarding its nuclear arsenal: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) calls on the President to immediately 
extend the New START Treaty until 2026; 
(2) affirms that, by extending the New 
START Treaty until 2026, the President of 
the United States can secure limitations on 
two new types of Russian Federation stra-
tegic weapons beyond those accountable 
when the Treaty entered into force in 2011 or 
at any time thereafter; 
(3) calls on the Russian Federation to cease 
the development of hazardous and provoca-
tive new weapons systems including the 
Burevestnik cruise missile, which is powered 
by a nuclear reactor and may violate the 
prohibition in numerous treaties and mili-
tary manuals against causing superfluous in-
jury and unnecessary suffering; 
(4) affirms the December 1987 statement by 
President Ronald Reagan and General Sec-
retary Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet 
Union that ‘‘a nuclear war cannot be won 
and must never be fought’’; 
(5) calls on the President to consider the 
views of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion and other United States allies and part-
ners who overwhelmingly back extension of 
the New START Treaty; and 
(6) supports, following the extension of the 
New START Treaty, a United States initia-
tive to engage China in negotiations towards 
the eventual conclusion of an arms control 
treaty or agreement, starting with steps to 
reduce the risk of strategic miscalculation 
and the threat of a nuclear exchange, which 
may include— 
(A) a formal invitation to appropriate offi-
cials from the People’s Republic of China, 
and to each of the permanent members of the 
United Nations Security Council, to observe 
a United States-Russian Federation New 
START Treaty on-site inspection in 2020 to 
demonstrate the security benefits of trans-
parency into strategic nuclear forces;

RESOLUTION 
674—COM-
MEMORATING JUNE 20, 2020, AS 
WORLD REFUGEE DAY 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
LEAHY) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 674 
Whereas World Refugee Day is a global 
event to acknowledge the courage, strength, 
and determination of women, men, and chil-
dren who are forced to flee their homes due 
to persecution; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘UNHCR’’) and section 
101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)), as added by section 
201 of the Refugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 96– 
212), a refugee is a person who— 
(1) is outside of the country of his or her 
nationality or habitual residence; and 
(2) is unable or unwilling to return because 
of a well-founded fear of persecution for rea-
sons of race, religion, nationality, political 
opinion, or membership in a particular social 
group; 
Whereas, according to the UNHCR, at the 
end of 2019— 
(1) there were at least 79,500,000 forcibly 
displaced people worldwide, which is the 
worst displacement crisis in recorded his-
tory, including— 
(A) 29,600,000 refugees; 
(B) more than 45,700,000 internally dis-
placed people; and 
(C) 4,200,000 asylum seekers; 
(2) 1 person out of every 97 people world-
wide was a refugee, an asylum seeker, or an 
internally displaced person; 
(3) the number of refugees under UNHCR’s 
mandate had doubled since 2010; 
(4) 68 percent of the world’s refugees came 
from only 5 countries (Syria, Venezuela, Af-
ghanistan, South Sudan, and Burma); 
(5) 73 percent of all refugees were residing 
in countries adjacent to the countries from 
which they had fled; 
(6) approximately 31,000,000 of the people 
who had been forcibly displaced and 50 per-
cent of all refugees were children younger 
than 18 years of age, millions of whom were 
unable to access basic services, including 
education; 
(7) approximately 11,000,000 people were 
newly displaced due to recent conflict or per-
secution, including 8,600,000 internally dis-
placed persons and 2,400,000 refugees and asy-
lum seekers, representing an average of at 
least 30,000 such people per day; 
(8) more than 50 percent of the population 
of Syria (at least 13,000,000 people) were dis-
placed, either across the international bor-
der or within Syria, which represents the 
largest displacement crisis in the world 
today; 
(9) more than 1,400,000 refugees needed re-
settlement to a third country (an 80 percent 
increase since 2011), while only 107,800 refu-
gees were resettled to a total of 26 countries; 
and 
(10) only 317,200 refugees voluntarily re-
turned to their country or place of origin, 
which represents fewer than 2 percent of the 
20,400,000 refugees under UNHCR’s mandate; 
Whereas millions of refugees around the 
world are stateless (not recognized as nation-
als by any state) and therefore require a 
path to citizenship as part of any solution to 
their displacement; 
Whereas refugee children are 5 times more 
likely to be out of school than non-refugee 
children; 
Whereas refugees who are women and girls 
are often at greater risk of violence, human 
trafficking, exploitation, and gender-based 
violence; 
Whereas more than 50 percent of refugees 
reside in urban areas; 
Whereas 85 percent of refugees and asylum 
seekers reside in developing countries, which 
places enormous additional pressure on the 
already limited resources of those countries; 
Whereas the average length of time refu-
gees remain displaced from their home coun-
try ranges between 10 and 26 years; 
Whereas while refugee resettlement is a 
critical solution for refugees, fewer than 10 
percent of global resettlement needs have 
been met and global refugee resettlement op-
portunities have fallen by 50 percent since 
2016; 
Whereas the United States resettlement 
program, which was established 40 years 
ago— 
(1) is a lifesaving solution crucial to global 
humanitarian efforts; 
(2) strengthens global security; 
(3) advances United States foreign policy 
goals; 
(4) supports regional host countries; and 
(5) assists individuals and families in need; 
Whereas the United States annual refugee 
admissions ceiling fell from 85,000 in fiscal 
year 2016 to 18,000 in fiscal year 2020, which 
represents the lowest level in the history of 
the program; 
Whereas, as of June 19, 2020 (9 months into 
fiscal year 2020), the United States had wel-
comed only 7,684 refugees into the country, 
which is fewer than 50 percent of the Presi-
dent’s 18,000 refugee admissions ceiling; 
Whereas, at this pace, the United States 
will not meet its fiscal year 2020 refugee ad-
missions goal; 
Whereas, for fiscal year 2020, the United 
States, irrespective of global resettlement 
needs, designated new thematic and regional 
allocations for United States refugee admis-
sions that prioritize— 
(1) refugees fleeing persecution on account 
of religious persecution; 
(2) Iraqis; and 
(3) refugees from Central America; 
Whereas refugees are the most vetted trav-
elers to enter the United States and are sub-
ject to extensive screening checks that may 
last between 18 months and 3 years, includ-
ing in-person interviews, biometric data 
checks, and multiple interagency reviews; 
Whereas refugees— 
(1) are major contributors to local econo-
mies; 
(2) pay an average of $21,000 more in taxes 
than they receive in benefits; and 
(3) revitalize cities and towns by— 
(A) offsetting population decline; and 
(B) boosting economic growth by opening 
businesses, 
paying 
taxes, 
and 
buying 
homes; 
Whereas certain industries and towns rely 
heavily on refugee workers to support their 
economic stability, and low rates of arrivals 
of refugees have had serious impacts on eco-
nomic growth; and 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic— 
(1) refugees, internally displaced persons, 
and asylum seekers, many of whom live in 
dangerously overcrowded settings and have 
inadequate access to basic services like 
healthcare, water, and sanitation, are espe-
cially vulnerable to the spread of the novel 
coronavirus; 
(2) well-intentioned government polices to 
mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus 
may exacerbate inequalities and dispropor-
tionately impact those already suffering 
from conflict and persecution; 
(3) UNHCR and the International Organiza-
tion for Migration suspended their inter-
national refugee resettlement operations for 
3 months, which negatively affected at least 
10,000 refugees who were already approved for 
travel to their respective countries of reset-
tlement; 
(4) numerous countries have restricted ac-
cess to asylum, including the United States, 
which summarily returned more than 40,000 
asylum seekers gathered at the southern 
United States border back to Mexico and 
only permitted 2 individuals to remain in the 
United States to request humanitarian pro-
tection between March 21 and May 13, 2020; 
and 
(5) many refugees are serving as critical 
frontline health professionals and essential 
workers combating the COVID–19 pandemic 
in the United States and other host coun-
tries: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of 
the United States to promote the safety, 
health, and well-being of millions of refu-
gees, including the education of refugee chil-
dren and displaced persons who flee war, per-
secution, or torture in search of peace, hope, 
and freedom; 
(2) recognizes those individuals who have 
risked their lives working, either individ-
ually or for nongovernmental organizations 
and international agencies, such as UNHCR, 
to provide lifesaving assistance and protec-
tion for people displaced by conflicts around 
the world; 
(3) underscores the importance of the 
United States refugee resettlement program 
as a critical tool for the United States Gov-
ernment— 
(A) to leverage foreign policy; 
(B) to strengthen national and regional se-
curity; and 
(C) to demonstrate international support 
of refugees; 
(4) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment— 
(A) to continue providing robust funding 
for refugee protection overseas and resettle-
ment in the United States; 
(B) to uphold its international leadership 
role in responding to displacement crises 
with humanitarian assistance and protection 
of the most vulnerable populations; 
(C) to work in partnership with the inter-
national community to find solutions to ex-
isting conflicts and prevent new conflicts 
from beginning; 
(D) to ensure that— 
(i) the United States refugee resettlement 
program is equipped to protect and support 
refugees; and 
(ii) the United States provides essential 
leadership to the international refugee as-
sistance community and to local commu-
nities across the United States seeking to 
welcome refugees and to help them achieve 
the American dream; 
(E) to alleviate the burden placed on front-
line refugee host countries, such as the 
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the People’s 
Republic of Bangladesh, the Republic of 
Uganda, the Republic of Colombia, and the 
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 
which receive the majority of the world’s ref-
ugees, and provide these countries with hu-
manitarian and development support;

ugees, affirmed by the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly on December 17, 2018, and join

Center on the 135th and final flight (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘STS–135’’) of the 
Space Transportation System of the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion 
(referred 
to 
in 
this 
preamble 
as 
‘‘NASA’’); 
Whereas, following the retirement of the 
space shuttle Atlantis, which was the last 
space shuttle in the fleet of the Space Trans-
portation System, and the formal end of the 
Space Shuttle Program on August 31, 2011, 
the United States lacked the domestic capa-
bility to launch astronauts to the Inter-
national Space Station (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘ISS’’) from United States 
soil; 
Whereas, following the end of the Space 
Shuttle Program in 2011, the only method for 
transporting astronauts of the United States 
to the ISS was to purchase seats on the 
Soyuz spacecraft of Russia at a cost of ap-
proximately $86,000,000 per seat; 
Whereas, in 2011, NASA began investing 
money in what would become the Commer-
cial Crew Program to stimulate efforts with-
in the private sector to aid in the develop-
ment and demonstration of safe, reliable, 
and cost-effective crew transportation capa-
bilities to replace the Space Transportation 
System; 
Whereas, in August 2012, NASA awarded 
funding to 3 participants under the Commer-
cial Crew Program, the Boeing Company, Si-
erra Nevada Corporation, and Space Explo-
ration Technologies Corporation (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘SpaceX’’), for the com-
mercial development of fully integrated crew 
transportation capabilities; 
Whereas, in September 2014, NASA com-
pleted the down selection process and award-
ed contracts under the Commercial Crew 
Program to 2 participants, the Boeing Com-
pany and SpaceX, for commercially built and 
operated integrated crew transportation sys-
tems; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2020, NASA and 
SpaceX completed the launch escape dem-
onstration of the Crew Dragon spacecraft 
and the Falcon 9 rocket, which was the final 
major flight test of the Crew Dragon space-
craft before a demonstration flight to the 
ISS with astronauts from the United States; 
Whereas, on May 30, 2020, Robert L. 
Behnken and Douglas G. Hurley became the 
first astronauts from the United States to 
launch to the ISS on a rocket of the United 
States from United States soil since STS–135 
on July 8, 2011; 
Whereas Douglas G. Hurley had also served 
on the crew of STS–135 as the pilot; 
Whereas, on May 31, 2020, Robert L. 
Behnken and Douglas G. Hurley arrived safe-
ly at the ISS, docking the Crew Dragon 
spacecraft to the Harmony module of the ISS 
and joining Expedition 63 as crew members; 
Whereas, on August 1, 2020, Robert L. 
Behnken and Douglas G. Hurley departed the 
ISS after spending 2 months as crew mem-
bers of Expedition 63; 
Whereas, on August 2, 2020, the Crew Drag-
on spacecraft safely splashed down off the 
coast of Florida; 
Whereas the successful completion of the 
Crew Dragon Demo–2 test flight marks a new 
chapter in human space exploration by 
transporting astronauts on a commercially 
built and operated spacecraft of the United 
States for the first time; and 
Whereas the continued leadership of the 
United States in space and space exploration 
is vital for— 
(1) both the national security and eco-
nomic prosperity of the United States and 
the friends and allies of the United States; 
and 
(2) the continued development and explo-
ration of space for the benefit of humankind: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the men and women of 
the Commercial Crew Program of the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion (referred to in this resolution as 
‘‘NASA’’) 
and 
Space 
Exploration 
Tech-
nologies Corporation (referred to in this res-
olution as ‘‘SpaceX’’) and astronauts Robert 
L. Behnken and Douglas G. Hurley on the 
successful completion of the Crew Dragon 
Demo–2 test flight; 
(2) honors the men and women of SpaceX 
and the Commercial Crew Program of NASA, 
who worked tirelessly to design, build, and 
operate the Crew Dragon spacecraft; 
(3) recognizes the contributions of all of 
the administrators, astronauts, engineers, 
scientists, and support staff— 
(A) who helped reach the milestone of the 
successful completion of the Crew Dragon 
Demo–2 test flight; and 
(B) whose dedication and continued efforts 
will ensure the continued leadership of the 
United States in space; 
(4) recognizes that NASA, through its pro-
grams of human space exploration, including 
Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the Space Shuttle 
Program, the International Space Station, 
and the Commercial Crew Program, has in-
spired and continues to inspire generations 
of children to become engineers, scientists, 
and explorers, which has led the United 
States to maintain its precedent of leader-
ship in human space exploration; and 
(5) reaffirms the commitment of the Sen-
ate to human space exploration for the ben-
efit of humankind.

SENATE RESOLUTION 676—TO AU-
THORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF 
RECORDS BY THE PERMANENT 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGA-
TIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON 
HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOV-
ERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself and 
Mr. SCHUMER) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to. 
S. RES. 676 
Whereas, the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations of the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Affairs con-
duced an investigation into the art industry 
and United States policies that undermine 
sanctions; 
Whereas, the Subcommittee has received a 
request from the U.S. Department of Home-
land Security for access to records of the 
Subcommittee’s investigation; 
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of 
the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under 
the control or in the possession of the Senate 
can, by administrative or judicial process, be 
taken from such control or possession but by 
permission of the Senate; 
Whereas, when it appears that evidence 
under the control or in the possession of the 
Senate is needed for the promotion of jus-
tice, the Senate will take such action as will 
promote the ends of justice consistent with 
th privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking 
Minority Member of the Permanent Sub-
committee on Investigations of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs, acting jointly, are authorized 
to provide to the U.S. Department of Home-
land Security and other regulatory agencies, 
law enforcement officials, and entities or in-
dividuals duly authorized by Federal or 
State government, records of the Sub-
committee’s investigation into the art indus-
try and the United States policies that un-
dermine sanctions. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Permanent Subcommittee on Inves-
tigations of the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs recently conducted an investiga-
tion into the use of the art industry to 
evade financial sanctions imposed by 
the United States on foreign adver-
saries. The subcommittee has now re-
ceived a request from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Homeland Security seeking ac-
cess to records that the subcommittee 
obtained during the investigation. 
In keeping with the Senate’s practice 
under its rules, this resolution would 
authorize the chairman and ranking

SENATE RESOLUTION 677—DESIG-
NATING AUGUST 16, 2020, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL AIRBORNE DAY’’ 
Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. 
SULLIVAN, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. PERDUE, Mr. 
COTTON, Mr. ROUNDS, Mr. JONES, Mr. 
VAN HOLLEN, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Ms. ROSEN, 
Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. 
MANCHIN, Mr. CASEY, Mr. KING, Ms. 
HIRONO, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mrs. LOEF-
FLER, and Mr. MCCONNELL) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 677 
Whereas the members of the airborne 
forces of the Armed Forces of the United 
States have a long and honorable history as 
bold and fierce warriors who, for the na-
tional security of the United States and the 
defense of freedom and peace, project the 
ground combat power of the United States 
by air transport to the far reaches of the bat-
tle area and to the far corners of the world; 
Whereas, on June 25, 1940, experiments 
with airborne operations by the United 
States began when the Army Parachute Test 
Platoon was first authorized by the Depart-
ment of War; 
Whereas, in July 1940, 48 volunteers began 
training for the Army Parachute Test Pla-
toon; 
Whereas the first official Army parachute 
jump took place on August 16, 1940, to test 
the innovative concept of inserting United 
States ground combat forces behind a battle 
line by means of a parachute; 
Whereas the success of the Army Para-
chute Test Platoon before the entry of the 
United States into World War II validated 
the airborne operational concept and led to 
the creation of a formidable force of airborne 
formations that included the 11th\\, 13th\\, 
17th\\, 82nd\\, and 101st\\ Airborne Divisions; 
Whereas, included in those divisions, and 
among 
other 
separate 
formations, 
were 
many airborne combat, combat support, and 
combat service support units that served 
with distinction and achieved repeated suc-
cess in armed hostilities during World War 
II; 
Whereas the achievements of the airborne 
units during World War II prompted the evo-
lution of those units into a diversified force 
of parachute and air-assault units that, over 
the years, have fought in Korea, the Domini-
can Republic, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, 
the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and 
have engaged in peacekeeping operations in 
Lebanon, Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, Haiti, 
Bosnia, and Kosovo; 
Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001, the members of the 
United States airborne forces, including 
members of the XVIII Airborne Corps, the 
82nd\\ Airborne Division, the 101st\\ Airborne 
Division (Air Assault), the 173rd\\ Airborne 
Brigade Combat Team, the 4th\\ Brigade 
Combat Team (Airborne) of the 25th\\ Infan-
try Division, the 75th\\ Ranger Regiment, 
special operations forces of the Army, Ma-
rine Corps, Navy, and Air Force, and other 
units of the Armed Forces, have dem-
onstrated bravery and honor in combat, sta-
bility, and training operations in Afghani-
stan and Iraq; 
Whereas the modern-day airborne forces 
also include other elite forces composed of 
airborne trained and qualified special oper-
ations warriors, including Army Special 
Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, 
Navy SEALs, and Air Force combat control 
and pararescue teams; 
Whereas, of the members and former mem-
bers of the United States airborne forces, 
thousands have achieved the distinction of 
making combat jumps, dozens have earned 
the Medal of Honor, and hundreds have 
earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the 
Silver Star, or other decorations and awards 
for displays of heroism, gallantry, intre-
pidity, and valor; 
Whereas the members and former members 
of the United States airborne forces are all 
members of a proud and honorable tradition 
that, together with the special skills and 
achievements of those members, distin-
guishes the members as intrepid combat 
parachutists, air assault forces, special oper-
ation forces, and, in the past, glider infantry; 
Whereas individuals from every State of 
the United States have served gallantly in 
the airborne forces, and each State is proud 
of the contributions of its paratrooper vet-
erans during the many conflicts faced by the 
United States; 
Whereas the history and achievements of 
the members and former members of the 
United States airborne forces warrant spe-
cial expressions of the gratitude of the peo-
ple of the United States; and 
Whereas, since the airborne forces, past 
and present, celebrate August 16 as the anni-
versary of the first official jump by the 
Army Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 is 
an appropriate day to recognize as National 
Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates August 16, 2020, as ‘‘National 
Airborne Day’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
to observe National Airborne Day with ap-
propriate programs, ceremonies, and activi-
ties.

TIONS TO THE FUTURE OF THE 
UNITED STATES 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. 
LANKFORD, Mr. BRAUN, Mrs. CAPITO, 
Ms. HARRIS, Ms. HASSAN, Mr. JONES, 
Mr. PETERS, and Ms. ROSEN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 678 
Whereas millions of children and youth in 
the United States represent the hopes and 
the future of the United States; 
Whereas numerous individuals, charities 
benefitting children, and youth-serving orga-
nizations that work with children and youth 
collaborate to provide invaluable services to 
enrich and better the lives of children and 
youth throughout the United States; 
Whereas raising awareness of, and increas-
ing support for, organizations that provide 
access to health care, social services, edu-
cation, the arts, sports, and other services 
will result in the development of character 
in, and the future success of, the children 
and youth of the United States; 
Whereas the month of September, as the 
school year begins, is a time when parents, 
families, teachers, school administrators, 
and communities increase the focus on chil-
dren and youth throughout the United 
States; 
Whereas the month of September is a time 
for the people of the United States to high-
light, and be mindful of, the needs of chil-
dren and youth; 
Whereas private corporations and busi-
nesses have joined with hundreds of national 
and local charitable organizations through-
out the United States in support of a month- 
long focus on children and youth; and 
Whereas designating September 2020 as 
‘‘National Child Awareness Month’’ would 
recognize that a long-term commitment to 
children and youth is in the public interest 
and will encourage widespread support for 
charities and organizations that seek to pro-
vide a better future for the children and 
youth of the United States: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate designates Sep-
tember 2020 as ‘‘National Child Awareness 
Month’’— 
(1) to promote awareness of charities that 
benefit children and youth-serving organiza-
tions throughout the United States; 
(2) to recognize the efforts made by those 
charities and organizations on behalf of chil-
dren and youth as critical contributions to 
the future of the United States; and 
(3) to recognize the importance of meeting 
the needs of at-risk children and youth, in-
cluding children and youth who— 
(A) have experienced homelessness; 
(B) are in the foster care system; 
(C) have been victims, or are at risk of be-
coming victims, of child sex trafficking; 
(D) have been impacted by violence; 
(E) have experienced trauma; and 
(F) have serious physical and mental 
health needs.

over 300 athletes for over two decades be-
cause of ineffective oversight by USA Gym-
nastics and the United States Olympic Com-
mittee. 
(3) While the case of Larry Nassar is un-
precedented in scale, the case is hardly the 
only recent incident of sexual abuse in ama-
teur sports. 
(4) Survivors of Larry Nassar’s abuse and 
all survivors of abuse in the Olympic and 
Paralympic movement deserve justice and 
redress for the wrongs the survivors have 
suffered. 
(5) After a comprehensive congressional in-
vestigation, including interviews and state-
ments from survivors, former and current or-
ganization officials, law enforcement, and 
advocates, Congress found that the United 
States Olympic Committee and USA Gym-
nastics fundamentally failed to uphold their 
existing statutory purposes and duty to pro-
tect amateur athletes from sexual, emo-
tional, or physical abuse. 
(6) USA Gymnastics and the United States 
Olympic Committee knowingly concealed 
abuse by Larry Nassar, leading to the abuse 
of dozens of additional amateur athletes dur-
ing the period beginning in the summer of 
2015 and ending in September 2016. 
(7) Ending abuse in the Olympic and 
Paralympic movement requires enhanced 
oversight to ensure that the Olympic and 
Paralympic movement does more to serve 
athletes and protect their voice and safety.

SEC. llll. STUDY, REPORT, AND MODELING 
TOOL RELATING TO THE TAX EQUIV-
ALENT 
AMOUNT 
OF 
PAYMENTS 
UNDER THE PAYMENT IN LIEU OF 
TAXES PROGRAM. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) Congress agreed with recommendations 
of a Federal commission that, if Federal land 
is to be retained by the Federal Government 
and not contribute to the tax bases of the 
local governments within the jurisdictions of 
which the land is located, compensation 
should be offered to those local governments 
to make up for the presence of nontaxable 
land within the jurisdictions of those local 
governments; 
(2) local governments rely on the stability 
of property tax revenues, but no precise fig-
ure can be given in advance for the author-
ization level of the payment in lieu of taxes 
program; 
(3) Federal agencies have determined that 
payments to local governments under the 
payment in lieu of taxes program are far 
lower than what would be due to local gov-
ernments under tax equivalency; 
(4) payments under the payment in lieu of 
taxes program help local governments carry 
out vital services, such as firefighting, police 
protection, public education, construction of 
public schools, construction of roads, and 
search-and-rescue operations; and 
(5) the technology exists to more accu-
rately determine what the taxable value of 
land held by the Federal Government would 
be if that land were taxable by local govern-
ments. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress 
that 
the 
Federal 
Government 
should— 
(1) determine the amount that payments 
under the payment in lieu of taxes program 
would be if those payments were equivalent 
to the tax revenues that local governments 
would otherwise receive for the same land; 
and 
(2) compensate those local governments ac-
cordingly. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES PROGRAM.— 
The term ‘‘payment in lieu of taxes pro-
gram’’ means the payment in lieu of taxes 
program established under chapter 69 of title 
31, United States Code. 
(2) 
SECRETARY.—The 
term 
‘‘Secretary’’ 
means the Secretary of the Interior. 
(3) TAX
EQUIVALENT
AMOUNT.—The term 
‘‘tax equivalent amount’’, with respect to 
payments under the payment in lieu of taxes 
program, means the amount of property tax 
revenues that would be generated for local 
governments (including the tax revenues of 
States, counties, cities, and other taxing ju-
risdictions, as applicable) for the Federal 
land eligible for those payments if that land 
were privately owned. 
(d) STUDY, REPORT, AND MODEL
ON TAX 
EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF PILT PAYMENTS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary, in consultation with the Sec-
retary of Agriculture and the head of any 
other Federal agency that the Secretary de-
termines to be appropriate, shall— 
(A) conduct a study—

‘‘(i) a natural cause; 
‘‘(ii) an anthropogenic cause; 
‘‘(iii) a combination of a natural cause and 
an anthropogenic cause; or 
‘‘(iv) an undetermined cause. 
‘‘(B) REVENUE LOSS THRESHOLDS.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary shall 
apply the following 12-month revenue loss 
thresholds in determining whether a fishery 
resource disaster has occurred: 
‘‘(I) Losses greater than 80 percent shall re-
sult in a positive determination that a fish-
ery resource disaster has occurred. 
‘‘(II) Losses between 35 percent and 80 per-
cent shall be evaluated to determine whether 
a fishery resource disaster has occurred, 
based on the information provided or ana-
lyzed under paragraph (4)(B). 
‘‘(III) Losses less than 35 percent shall not 
be eligible for a determination that a fishery 
resource disaster has occurred, except where 
the Secretary determines there are extenu-
ating circumstances that justify using a 
lower threshold in making the determina-
tion. 
‘‘(ii) CHARTER FISHING.—In making a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred, the Secretary shall con-
sider the economic impacts to the charter 
fishing industry to ensure financial coverage 
for charter fishing businesses.

disaster has occurred, the Secretary may 
consider loss of subsistence opportunity, 
where appropriate. 
‘‘(C) INELIGIBLE FISHERIES.—A fishery sub-
ject to overfishing in any of the 3 years pre-
ceding the date of a determination under 
this subsection is not eligible for a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred unless the Secretary de-
termines that overfishing was not a contrib-
uting factor to the fishery resource disaster. 
‘‘(D) EXCEPTIONAL
CIRCUMSTANCES.—In an 
exceptional circumstance where substantial 
economic impacts to the affected fishery and 
fishing community have been subject to a 
disaster declaration under another statutory 
authority, such as in the case of a natural 
disaster or from the direct consequences of a 
Federal action taken to prevent, or in re-
sponse to, a natural disaster for purposes of 
protecting life and safety, the Secretary may

ery resource disaster has occurred, based on 
the revenue loss thresholds under subpara-
graph (B), and, if a fishery resource disaster 
has occurred, whether the fishery resource 
disaster was due to— 
‘‘(i) a natural cause; 
‘‘(ii) an anthropogenic cause; 
‘‘(iii) a combination of a natural cause and 
an anthropogenic cause; or 
‘‘(iv) an undetermined cause. 
‘‘(B) REVENUE LOSS THRESHOLDS.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary shall 
apply the following 12-month revenue loss 
thresholds in determining whether a fishery 
resource disaster has occurred: 
‘‘(I) Losses greater than 80 percent shall re-
sult in a positive determination that a fish-
ery resource disaster has occurred. 
‘‘(II) Losses between 35 percent and 80 per-
cent shall be evaluated to determine whether 
a fishery resource disaster has occurred, 
based on the information provided or ana-
lyzed under paragraph (4)(B). 
‘‘(III) Losses less than 35 percent shall not 
be eligible for a determination that a fishery 
resource disaster has occurred, except where 
the Secretary determines there are extenu-
ating circumstances that justify using a 
lower threshold in making the determina-
tion. 
‘‘(ii) CHARTER FISHING.—In making a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred, the Secretary shall con-
sider the economic impacts to the charter 
fishing industry to ensure financial coverage 
for charter fishing businesses. 
‘‘(iii) SUBSISTENCE USES.—In making a de-
termination of whether a fishery resource 
disaster has occurred, the Secretary may 
consider loss of subsistence opportunity, 
where appropriate. 
‘‘(C) INELIGIBLE FISHERIES.—A fishery sub-
ject to overfishing in any of the 3 years pre-
ceding the date of a determination under 
this subsection is not eligible for a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred unless the Secretary de-
termines that overfishing was not a contrib-
uting factor to the fishery resource disaster. 
‘‘(D) EXCEPTIONAL
CIRCUMSTANCES.—In an 
exceptional circumstance where substantial 
economic impacts to the affected fishery and 
fishing community have been subject to a 
disaster declaration under another statutory 
authority, such as in the case of a natural 
disaster or from the direct consequences of a 
Federal action taken to prevent, or in re-
sponse to, a natural disaster for purposes of 
protecting life and safety, the Secretary may 
determine a fishery resource disaster has oc-
curred without a request or without con-
ducting the required analyses in subpara-
graphs (A) and (B). 
‘‘(6) DISBURSAL OF APPROPRIATED FUNDS.— 
‘‘(A) AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary shall 
allocate funds available under paragraph (9)

date of the appropriation or the determina-
tion of a fishery resource disaster, whichever 
occurs later. 
‘‘(ii) EXTENSION
OF
DEADLINE.—The Sec-
retary may extend the deadline under clause 
(i) by 90 days to evaluate and make deter-
minations on eligible requests. 
‘‘(C) CONSIDERATIONS.—In determining the 
allocation of appropriations for a fishery re-
source disaster, the Secretary shall consider 
commercial, charter, headboat, or seafood 
processing revenue losses and may consider 
the following factors: 
‘‘(i) Direct economic impacts.

tion from funds available under paragraph 
(9), a requestor with an affirmative fishery 
resource disaster determination shall submit 
a spend plan to the Secretary, not more than 
120 days after receiving notification that 
funds are available, that shall include the

SEC. ll02. PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP. 
(a) AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS

the Secretary is authorized to partner with 
employers to supplement compensation of an

covery of the aviation manufacturing indus-
try by entering into agreements with such

tributions in accordance with this title. The

amount sufficient to maintain the total 
compensation level for the at-risk employee

(b) PROCEDURES.—As soon as practicable,

tion and minimum eligibility requirements

mines necessary. 
(c) TERMS AND CONDITIONS.—Upon submis-
sion of an application, the Secretary may 
partner with an employer to provide to the 
employer a public partner contribution, that 
together with the private partner contribu-
tion, shall constitute an amount sufficient 
to maintain the total compensation level of 
the at-risk employee group, for a period not 
to exceed 1 year, if the Secretary determines 
that— 
(1) the employer establishes that economic 
conditions as of the date of the application 
would make necessary a furlough or perma-
nent reduction in force of a portion of its 
workforce devoted to aviation manufac-
turing; 
(2) there is an identifiable at-risk employee 
group; 
(3) the employer agrees to fund the private 
partner contribution for as long as it is ac-
cepting the public partner contribution (and, 
in the event circumstances dictate that the 
employer cease its participation in this pro-
gram early, the employer agrees and shall 
notify the Secretary that there shall be no 
further obligation of the Secretary to fund 
the public partner contribution); 
(4) the employer commits to refrain from 
any furlough or permanent reduction in 
force of employees in the at-risk employee 
group for as long as it accepts public partner 
contributions for that group, subject to the 
employer’s right to discipline or terminate 
an employee in accordance with employer 
policy; 
(5) the employer shall use the public and 
private partner contribution solely for the 
purpose of providing compensation and bene-
fits of the at-risk employee group and for no 
other purpose; and

tion shall be utilized solely for compensation

the employer, including the extent to which 
the employer has experienced a deterioration 
in cash position, loss of revenue, and other 
relevant information; 
(2) information regarding the likelihood 
the employer will need to impose a furlough 
or permanent reduction in force of employ-
ees in the at-risk employee group in the ab-
sence of the partnership and the factors that 
would be used to determine which employees 
in the at-risk employee group are likely to 
be so affected, including whether the selec-
tion of employees to be so affected would be 
based on a general reduction in headcount 
across the business or by location (or both), 
position, or other factors; and 
(3) any other information the Secretary 
deems relevant to determining whether to 
enter into a private-public partnership with 
an employer or to the terms for such a part-
nership with a specific employer. 
(e) NO LIMIT ON NUMBER AGREEMENTS WITH 
AN EMPLOYER.—An employer may seek and 
be granted public partner contributions

TITLE ll CORPS ACT 
SEC. ll 1. SHORT TITLE.— 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Cultivating 
Opportunity and Response to the Pandemic 
through Service Act’’ or the ‘‘CORPS Act’’. 
SEC. ll2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States has a strong history 
of citizen response to national calls to serv-
ice in order to help the Nation recover in 
times of crisis. 
(2) More than 80 years ago, the Nation rose 
to the challenge of the Great Depression 
with the creation of citizen service programs 
like the Civilian Conservation Corps (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘CCC’’) and 
the Works Progress Administration (referred 
to in this section as the ‘‘WPA’’). 
(3) Millions of participants benefitted from 
paid employment and opportunities to de-
velop their skills while constructing na-
tional parks and public lands infrastructure 
and producing cultural works still enjoyed 
today. 
(4) Following decades of evolution, incor-
porating policies of both political parties, to-
day’s national service programs carry on the 
legacy of the CCC and WPA. 
(5) Founded in 1990, the Corporation for Na-
tional and Community Service today coordi-
nates national service by individuals in the 
United States across every State and terri-
tory, partnering with State-level commis-
sions and supporting locally driven services 
in partnership with nongovernmental organi-
zations and State governments. 
(6) National service programs provide pub-
lic health, education, employment training, 
and nutrition services for which the Nation 
has a critical need in the current crisis. 
(7) The signature programs of the Corpora-
tion for National and Community Service, 
which are the AmeriCorps State and Na-
tional, AmeriCorps National Civilian Com-
munity Corps, AmeriCorps VISTA, and Na-
tional Senior Service Corps programs, can 
and should be expanded to meet current 
needs. 
(8) The novel coronavirus pandemic has in-
fected and killed individuals in every State 
and territory, causing more than 2,000,000 
cases and 115,000 deaths so far. 
(9) In response, States, tribal governments, 
and cities across the country have closed 
down businesses, schools, and public events, 
leading to a dramatic drop in economic ac-
tivity and a sharp projected decline in the 
United States economy. 
(10) More than 40,000,000 applications for 
unemployment benefits have been filed in re-
cent weeks, with weekly filings repeatedly 
exceeding historic record levels. 
(11) More than 1 in every 10 adults in the 
United States has applied for unemployment 
insurance since the crisis began. 
(12) The pandemic and the associated eco-
nomic consequences have disproportionately 
impacted people of color across many States. 
(13) To recover, the Nation also needs 
meaningful employment opportunities, as 
well as a significant expansion of the human 
capital working to address community needs 
around public health, behavioral health, 
hunger, education, and conservation. 
(14) Experience has demonstrated the cen-
trality of community participation in pan-
demic response, to overcome stigma and 
structural barriers and meet the full needs of 
all members of a diverse community. 
(15) As the Nation works to respond to and 
recover from the current twin challenges of 
a public health pandemic and an economic 
crisis, national service presents a unique op-
portunity for flexible, locally driven re-
sponses to meet State and local public 
health, employment, and recovery needs.

ices in response to the pandemic and eco-
nomic crisis;

(3) to stabilize such national service pro-
grams during economic crisis; and

uals in the United States to engage in serv-
ice.

TITLE ll—CORPS ACT 
SEC. ll 1. SHORT TITLE.— 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Cultivating 
Opportunity and Response to the Pandemic 
through Service Act’’ or the ‘‘CORPS Act’’. 
SEC. ll2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States has a strong history 
of citizen response to national calls to serv-
ice in order to help the Nation recover in 
times of crisis. 
(2) More than 80 years ago, the Nation rose 
to the challenge of the Great Depression 
with the creation of citizen service programs 
like the Civilian Conservation Corps (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘CCC’’) and 
the Works Progress Administration (referred 
to in this section as the ‘‘WPA’’). 
(3) Millions of participants benefitted from 
paid employment and opportunities to de-
velop their skills while constructing na-
tional parks and public lands infrastructure 
and producing cultural works still enjoyed 
today. 
(4) Following decades of evolution, incor-
porating policies of both political parties, to-
day’s national service programs carry on the 
legacy of the CCC and WPA. 
(5) Founded in 1990, the Corporation for Na-
tional and Community Service today coordi-
nates national service by individuals in the 
United States across every State and terri-
tory, partnering with State-level commis-
sions and supporting locally driven services 
in partnership with nongovernmental organi-
zations and State governments. 
(6) National service programs provide pub-
lic health, education, employment training, 
and nutrition services for which the Nation 
has a critical need in the current crisis. 
(7) The signature programs of the Corpora-
tion for National and Community Service, 
which are the AmeriCorps State and Na-
tional, AmeriCorps National Civilian Com-
munity Corps, AmeriCorps VISTA, and Na-
tional Senior Service Corps programs, can 
and should be expanded to meet current 
needs. 
(8) The novel coronavirus pandemic has in-
fected and killed individuals in every State 
and territory, causing more than 2,000,000 
cases and 115,000 deaths so far. 
(9) In response, States, tribal governments, 
and cities across the country have closed 
down businesses, schools, and public events, 
leading to a dramatic drop in economic ac-
tivity and a sharp projected decline in the 
United States economy. 
(10) More than 40,000,000 applications for 
unemployment benefits have been filed in re-
cent weeks, with weekly filings repeatedly 
exceeding historic record levels. 
(11) More than 1 in every 10 adults in the 
United States has applied for unemployment 
insurance since the crisis began. 
(12) The pandemic and the associated eco-
nomic consequences have disproportionately 
impacted people of color across many States. 
(13) To recover, the Nation also needs 
meaningful employment opportunities, as 
well as a significant expansion of the human 
capital working to address community needs 
around public health, behavioral health, 
hunger, education, and conservation. 
(14) Experience has demonstrated the cen-
trality of community participation in pan-
demic response, to overcome stigma and 
structural barriers and meet the full needs of 
all members of a diverse community. 
(15) As the Nation works to respond to and 
recover from the current twin challenges of 
a public health pandemic and an economic 
crisis, national service presents a unique op-
portunity for flexible, locally driven re-
sponses to meet State and local public 
health, employment, and recovery needs. 
SEC. ll3. PURPOSES. 
The purposes of this title are— 
(1) to provide for annual growth of 250,000 
participants, over 3 years, in national service 
programs, such as the Public Land Corps 
(also known as the 21st Century Conserva-
tion Service Corps) programs and other 
AmeriCorps programs, that will provide serv-
ices in response to the pandemic and eco-
nomic crisis; 
(2) to ensure that participant allowances 
cover the reasonable cost of participation 
and provide participants with economic and 
educational opportunity; 
(3) to stabilize such national service pro-
grams during economic crisis; and 
(4) to support opportunities for all individ-
uals in the United States to engage in serv-
ice.

(1954), that separate educational facilities for

ing that school segregation was unconstitu-
tional;

ciple of State action in Burton v. Wil-
mington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715

State has approved, encouraged, or facili-
tated the relevant private conduct;

‘‘(t) OTHER PIPELINE SAFETY PRACTICES.— 
‘‘(1) RECORDS.—Not later than 2 years after 
the date of enactment of this subsection, the 
Secretary shall promulgate regulations to 
require an operator of a distribution sys-
tem— 
‘‘(A) to identify and manage traceable, re-
liable, and complete records, including maps 
and other drawings, critical to ensuring 
proper pressure controls for a gas distribu-
tion system, and updating these records as 
needed, while collecting and identifying 
other records necessary for risk analysis on 
an opportunistic basis; and 
‘‘(B) to ensure that the records required 
under subparagraph (A) are— 
‘‘(i) accessible to all personnel responsible 
for performing or overseeing relevant con-
struction or engineering work; and 
‘‘(ii) submitted to, or made available for 
inspection by, the Secretary or the relevant 
State authority with a certification in effect 
under section 60105. 
‘‘(2) PRESENCE OF QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of enactment of this sub-
section, the Secretary shall promulgate reg-
ulations to require that not less than 1 agent 
of an operator of a distribution system who 
is qualified to perform relevant covered 
tasks (as defined in section 192.801(b) of title 
49, Code of Federal Regulations (or a suc-
cessor regulation)) shall monitor gas pres-
sure at the district regulator station or at an 
alternative site with equipment capable of 
ensuring proper pressure controls and have 
the capability to promptly shut down the 
flow of gas or control over pressurization at 
a district regulator station during any con-
struction project that has the potential to 
cause a hazardous overpressurization at that 
station, including tie-ins and abandonment 
of distribution lines and mains, based on an 
evaluation, conducted by the operator, of 
threats that could result in unsafe operation. 
‘‘(B) EXCLUSION.—In promulgating regula-
tions under subparagraph (A), the Secretary 
shall ensure that those regulations do not 
apply to a district regulating station that 
has a monitoring system and the capability 
for remote or automatic shutoff. 
‘‘(3) DISTRICT REGULATOR STATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year 
after the date of enactment of this sub-
section, the Secretary shall promulgate reg-
ulations to require that each operator of a 
distribution system assesses and upgrades, 
as appropriate, each district regulator sta-
tion of the operator to ensure that— 
‘‘(i) the risk of the gas pressure in the dis-
tribution system exceeding, by a common 
mode of failure, the maximum allowable op-
erating pressure (as described in section 
192.623 of title 49, Code of Federal Regula-
tions (or a successor regulation)) allowed 
under Federal law (including regulations) is 
minimized; 
‘‘(ii) the gas pressure of a low-pressure dis-
tribution system is monitored, particularly 
at or near the location of critical pressure- 
control equipment; 
‘‘(iii) the regulator station has secondary 
or backup pressure-relieving or overpressure- 
protection safety technology, such as a relief 
valve or automatic shutoff valve, or other 
pressure-limiting devices appropriate for the 
configuration and siting of the station and, 
in the case of a regulator station that em-
ploys the primary and monitor regulator de-
sign, the operator shall eliminate the com-
mon mode of failure or provide backup pro-
tection capable of either shutting the flow of 
gas, relieving gas to the atmosphere to fully 
protect the distribution system from over-
pressurization events, or there must be tech-
nology in place to eliminate a common mode 
of failure; and 
‘‘(iv) if the Secretary determines that it is 
not operationally possible for an operator to 
implement the requirements under clause 
(iii), the Secretary shall require such oper-
ator to identify actions in their plan that 
minimize the risk of an overpressurization 
event.’’.

tection safety technology, such as a relief valve 
or automatic shutoff valve, or other pressure- 
limiting devices appropriate for the configura-
tion and siting of the station and, in the case of 
a regulator station that employs the primary 
and monitor regulator design, the operator shall 
eliminate the common mode of failure or provide 
backup protection capable of either shutting the 
flow of gas, relieving gas to the atmosphere to 
fully protect the distribution system from over-
pressurization events, or there must be tech-
nology in place to eliminate a common mode of 
failure; and 
‘‘(iv) if the Secretary determines that it is not 
operationally possible for an operator to imple-
ment the requirements under clause (iii), the 
Secretary shall require such operator to identify 
actions in their plan that minimize the risk of
