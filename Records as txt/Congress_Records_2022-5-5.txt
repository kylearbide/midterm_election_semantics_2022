Let us pray. 
Almighty 
God,

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
STUDENT LOAN DEBT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
Albany, NY, a grandmother of four re-
ported recently that rising prices have 
forced her and her husband, a retired 
New York police officer, to cut back on 
eating out. ‘‘I feel it in the pocket-
book,’’ she said. 
In Grand Rapids, MI, one young fam-
ily reported that, before inflation took 
off, ‘‘the paycheck went a little bit fur-
ther.’’ Now, on essentials like gas and 
groceries, ‘‘there’s no wiggle room.’’ 
In Springfield, MO, a food truck 
owner said that he and his wife are 
having to take business farther and 
farther from home despite gas prices. 
Stories like these aren’t exceptions; 
they are the rule. Working Americans 
have been absolutely swamped by ris-
ing prices. 
Two-thirds of Americans told one re-
cent survey that inflation has been dif-
ficult or even a hardship for their fami-
lies. Fewer than one in five says the 
Biden administration’s policies have 
done anything to improve economic 
conditions, and yet, as we speak, with 
the economy already scuffling, Wash-
ington Democrats are proposing more 
reckless spending and the biggest tax 
hike in American history. For example, 
President Biden is considering trying 
to buy up his sinking approval ratings 
by magically waving away $1.6 trillion 
in student loan obligations. 
So let’s put a few things into perspec-
tive. 
More than a third of Americans did 
not pursue education beyond high 
school. Of the Americans who did re-
ceive additional schooling, barely one 
in four holds any student debt at all. In 
fact, an outright majority of the $1.6 
trillion in Federal student debt is held 
by professionals with advanced degrees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2344 
May 5, 2022 
Working people who chose to avoid 
taking on debt should not have to bail 
out high-earning doctors, lawyers, and 
dentists or adults who borrowed six fig-
ures for an Ivy League master’s. 
President Biden wants to effectively 
funnel money away from people who 
decided to learn a trade, away from 
people who chose community college, 
away from people who made tough sac-
rifices to actually pay off their loans in 
order to buy more enthusiasm from one 
of the Democrats’ loudest and farthest 
left constituencies. Young liberal pro-
fessionals with elite degrees and mas-
sive earning potential get a giant hand-
out, and working people in rural Amer-
ica get the bill. 
As one scholar from a left-leaning 
think tank puts it: 
Almost a third of all student debt is owed 
by the wealthiest 20 percent of households 
[while] only 8 percent by the bottom 20 per-
cent. 
He concludes: 
Student debt is concentrated among high- 
wealth households, and loan forgiveness is 
regressive whether measured by income, edu-
cational attainment, or wealth. 
Even among the small slice of Ameri-
cans who do have some student debt, 
the majority owes less than $20,000. Ah, 
but the senior Senator from Massachu-
setts has proposed a cap that would 
cover debt up to 21⁄2 times that amount. 
She is laser focused on giving the fu-
ture lawyers and future doctors of 
Cambridge, MA, this massive gift be-
fore this November. 
You literally have Democrat State 
attorneys general writing the adminis-
tration, demanding the Federal govern-
ment ‘‘exercise its authority to cancel 
federal student loan debt for every [sin-
gle] borrower.’’ 
Student loan socialism would be a 
giant slap in the face to every family 
who sacrificed to save for college; to 
every graduate who paid their debt; to 
every worker who made a different ca-
reer choice so they could stay debt- 
free. 
Now, a little more than a year ago, 
President Biden was saying: 
I don’t think I have the authority to do it 
by signing with a pen. 
Speaker PELOSI affirmed that view, 
saying: 
People think the president . . . has the 
power for debt forgiveness—he does not. 
Even the former general counsel at 
the Obama Education Department con-
cluded: 
The Executive Branch likely does not have 
the unilateral authority to engage in mass 
student debt cancelation. 
But, apparently, lackluster poll num-
bers have the President considering 
breaking the law and plowing ahead 
anyway. 
So think about this very concretely. 
Democrats want construction workers, 
police officers, and small business own-
ers in Kentucky to effectively eat the 
student loans of surgeons, corporate 
lawyers, and people in New York City 
who chose to borrow $180,000 for a mas-
ter’s from the Columbia film school, 
with no plan whatsoever for paying it 
back. 
In addition to making inflation even 
worse across the board, this jubilee for 
the elites would do nothing to combat 
runaway costs in higher education. 
Mindless subsidies would just make the 
runaway costs even worse. I would like 
to see one single Democrat visit the 
working people in Kentucky and defend 
this proposal with a straight face. 
Democrats’ 
policies 
already 
have 
working Americans facing the worst 
inflation in more than 40 years as well 
as the risk of a recession. But instead 
of trying to help middle-class families, 
Democrats are cooking up massive 
bailouts for Ivy League graduates. You 
can hardly dream up something more 
unfair. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, now on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, more than 2 months into 
Russia’s war on Ukraine, the free world 
has observed a few important dynam-
ics. 
First, we saw the incredible resil-
ience of the Ukrainian people and their 
resolve to win. Second, we saw how ill- 
prepared Putin’s forces were to encoun-
ter serious resistance. But most re-
cently, we have been reminded of what 
a wounded bear is able and willing to 
do. 
The terrible destruction of Mariupol, 
the constant barrages of contested 
towns in the east, and the continuing 
long-range missile attacks against cit-
ies far from the front are a stark re-
minder of the horrific costs of this con-
flict that may well continue for some 
time. 
Our brave friends in Ukraine are not 
out of the woods. And as I have said re-
peatedly, America and our allies must 
be willing to help them win. If the out-
come of this conflict is an emboldened 
Russia or a fractured Ukraine, there is 
no question that the risks to the 
United States, to NATO, and to other 
American partners will grow. 
First and foremost, that means seri-
ous, ongoing commitments to deliver 
more of the sorts of lethal capabilities 
that have sustained their resistance 
thus far. 
The United States is rightly the lead-
ing supplier of military assistance to 
Ukraine’s fighting forces, but to the 
administration’s credit, they are also 
increasingly coordinating a growing 
international response. 
While the preponderance of our sup-
port should focus on ensuring Ukraine 
has the military capability to defend 
itself in the months ahead, we should 
also contribute to the multinational 
economic and humanitarian support 
Kyiv needs. We must also make new in-
vestments in U.S. capabilities, address-
ing munition shortfalls and defense in-
dustrial bottlenecks to ensure that we 
can 
more 
rapidly 
produce 
critical 
weapons systems that would prove es-
sential for Ukraine, vulnerable eastern 
flank allies, or our own military in the 
months ahead. 
Obviously, there is broad bipartisan 
support for a robust aid package. But 
even a strong bipartisan vote will not 
mean much if we don’t deliver on this 
promise soon. 
For this reason, we cannot allow this 
bill to be a vessel for extraneous mat-
ters. This isn’t about battling climate 
change; this is about helping Ukraine 
defeat a military aggressor on the bat-
tleground. 
Urgent assistance for Ukraine’s fight 
must move at the speed of relevance. 
Every day this aid spends tied down in 
unrelated business here in Washington 
is a day it is not helping Kyiv turn the 
tide. If the Senate is serious about 
helping Ukraine win, we need to show 
it by passing supplemental assistance— 
clean, no strings attached, and soon. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yester-
day the Federal Reserve raised interest 
rates by half a percentage point, the 
biggest rate hike in 22 years. The effort 
is underway to stop inflation. For mil-
lions of American families who are 
struggling to pay their bills and afford 
the basics, this can’t come fast enough. 
The U.S. economy has added nearly 1.7 
million jobs this year. Consumer spend-
ing is strong, but higher costs for gro-
ceries, gas, housing, and more are 
straining family budgets and making 
people very anxious about their future. 
In announcing the interest rate hike 
yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman 
Jerome Powell said the following: The 
biggest drivers of inflation today are 
higher prices caused by Russia’s war on 
Ukraine and rising COVID cases in 
China, which can further disrupt sup-
ply chains. In other words, the Federal 
Reserve Chairman said two of the big-
gest drivers of inflation are really glob-
al; they are complicated; and they 
aren’t going to be solved by America 
alone. 
Fortunately, there are some simple 
solutions we can take to help families 
save money. Let me tell you about 
three of them. The first is to cut gas 
prices. I can’t think of a single cost of 
living that is more visible. Every street 
corner in America has a sign declaring 
what the cost of a gallon of gasoline is, 
and people compare these in their mind 
even as they drive down the road. Some 
people make a hobby of it. Anyone who 
has filled up a gas tank in the last few 
months has felt the sticker shock of 
Mr. Putin’s war on Ukraine. 
President Biden has already made 
two changes that will reduce gas 
prices. A little over a month ago, he 
announced the United States will re-
lease 1 million barrels of oil a day from 
its Strategic Petroleum Reserve—in

other words, to increase the supply in 
an effort to bring down the price—1 
million gallons a day for 6 months, 
while oil companies ramp up domestic 
production to make up the shortage 
caused by Mr. Putin’s war. 
President Biden also has issued an 
emergency fuel waiver allowing E15 
gas—that is gas with a higher blend of 
ethanol—to be sold across America this 
summer. Normally E15 isn’t sold in the 
summer, but the White House esti-
mates that by allowing gas stations to 
sell it, it will save Americans 10 cents 
a gallon. 
Of course, if we are really serious 
about cutting gas prices and reducing 
the power of tyrants like Putin whose 
nations happen to sit on big oil re-
serves, we can do that by investing 
more in electric cars and clean energy 
sources that don’t break the bank or 
bake the planet. 
Here is another solution that can 
save millions of families hundreds of 
dollars every single month. Let’s agree 
to cap the monthly cost of insulin for 
diabetes at $35. In 1923, almost 100 
years ago, researchers in Canada were 
awarded the Nobel Prize for the dis-
covery of insulin to manage diabetes. 
They sold the patent—listen care-
fully—for this drug discovery for $1. 
They wanted to make sure that no one 
would ever profit from this lifesaving 
drug. 
Fast forward 100 years. Something 
has gone terribly wrong. The same vial 
of Humalog insulin that Eli Lilly sells 
for $40 in Canada, it charges $350 for in 
the United States—40 in Canada, 350 
here. The maker of Lantus insulin has 
raised their price more than 26 times 
since the year 2000: from $35 to more 
than $300 today—26 price hikes in 22 
years. 
The cost of insulin can range from a 
couple hundred dollars a month to 
more than $1,000 a month. That is the 
price this year. Who knows how much 
it will be next year. Who bears the bur-
den of these costs? Patients and fami-
lies. There are 37 million Americans 
who have diabetes. The number goes up 
every year. 
Senator WARNOCK of Georgia has in-
troduced a critical bill, the Affordable 
Insulin Now Act, to cap the monthly 
cost of insulin at $35 a month. I am a 
cosponsor. Many Senators are. Senator 
COLLINS
and Senator SHAHEEN
are 
spearheading a similar bipartisan ef-
fort to support it. 
I urge more of our Republican col-
leagues to listen to the people they 
represent. There are lots of people 
struggling to afford insulin in their 
States as well as the blue States. Let’s 
do this together. Can’t we agree on one 
thing in the U.S. Senate that we are 
going to do to help America this year? 
I think this is a good project and a 
good goal. 
The third way we can reduce infla-
tion is a little more complicated, but it 
is worth talking about. We need to rein 
in the excessive fees charged by Visa 
and Mastercard for their products. 
We had a hearing yesterday. It was in 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. It 
was on something called a swipe fee. Of 
course, the swipe fee is the amount of 
money that has to be paid in order to 
move that piece of plastic through the 
machine. Most consumers don’t even 
know it exists. Every retailer knows it 
exists. 
It was the first hearing our com-
mittee has held on this topic in 16 
years—16 years. And I was there 16 
years ago. I walked into the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, chaired by the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania, Arlen Specter, 
and the hearing was on swipe fees and 
interchange fees. I had never heard of 
the term before, and I sat down and I 
learned. 
What happened in that meeting was 
an exposition of the current situation 
for every restaurant that you go to buy 
a meal in, every store that you shop in, 
all the grocery stores. Any store that 
takes plastic knows what a swipe fee or 
an interchange fee is. 
Here is how it works. Visa and 
Mastercard control over 80 percent of 
the credit and debit card markets in 
the United States—starting point. It 
isn’t as if you can walk away from 
these two companies and be a retailer 
in America. If you are going to take 
plastic, you are going to take these 
cards. 
And every time a card with a Visa or 
Mastercard logo is swiped at the re-
tailer, Visa and Mastercard charge a 
fee that takes a cut out of whatever 
the transaction amount turns out to 
be. Now, some of that cut Visa and 
Mastercard keep for themselves. Most 
of it is given to the bank that issues 
the card. 
The fee that Mastercard and Visa re-
quire the card-accepting merchant to 
pay to the card-issuing bank is the 
interchange fee. It is usually charged 
as a percentage of the transaction plus 
a flat fee, for example, 2 percent of 
whatever the transaction cost is plus 10 
cents. 
How does that work out in practice? 
Just an example: Say you buy $100 
worth of groceries or kids’ clothes on 
your credit card. After the fees are de-
ducted, the merchant gets $98, maybe a 
little less. For merchants operating on 
tight profit margins—and that is most 
of them—these fees can add up to a big 
problem. 
Laura Karet was one of our witnesses 
yesterday. She is an amazing woman. 
What a resume. She is the CEO of a su-
permarket 
chain 
known 
as 
Giant 
Eagle. It is a regional, American-owned 
chain of grocery stores based in Pitts-
burgh, PA. At our hearing yesterday, 
she explained that her industry—gro-
ceries—typically operates on a 1-per-
cent profit margin—1 percent. So the 2- 
percent swipe fee wipes out their entire 
profit. 
What do they do? Well, there is only 
one obvious answer: They raise the 
prices to cover the high swipe fees re-
quired by Visa and Mastercard, and 
customers end up holding the bag. 
Remember, we started this conversa-
tion about inflation. Make no mistake, 
what I have just described to you is in-
flationary. 
Swipe fees aren’t just annoying to 
the retailers; they are anti-competi-
tive. Ms. Karet told us the story that 
on April 22, she received the latest 
modification of the swipe fees being 
charged to her businesses by Visa and 
Mastercard. She said the modification 
was 300 pages long, almost unintelli-
gible. She handed it over to her ac-
countants and to her lawyers and said: 
Make some sense out of it. What are 
they doing to me? 
The banks get the swipe fees, but the 
banks do not set the fees. Banks let 
Visa and Mastercard do the behind-the- 
scenes work and fix the fees. That 
means that all the thousands of card- 
issuing 
banks 
in 
the 
Visa 
and 
Mastercard network receive the same 
exact schedule of swipe fees from mer-
chants regardless of whether they are 
efficient or inefficient, regardless of 
whether or not they are preventing 
fraud. It is a free lunch for the banks. 
When the fee rates go up, as they did 
just a few weeks ago, banks make more 
money every time people use plastic— 
debit or credit cards—and they issue 
more cards. That benefits Visa and 
Mastercard, which take their cut, 
called a network fee, out of each swipe. 
So Visa and Mastercard have an incen-
tive to keep raising fees. 
What can merchants do? Well, you 
might think they would sit down at the 
table and say: We are going to bargain 
about this fee, Visa and Mastercard. 
We object to it being raised, and we 
want to let you know that if you want 
to do business with our business, that 
is the way it will be. 
That doesn’t happen at all. This is 
noncompetitive. Visa and Mastercard 
control 80 percent of the plastic mar-
ket in America. They say to the gro-
cery store, to the restaurant, to the 
shop: Take it or leave it. Play by our 
rules or you won’t play at all. We just 
won’t even let people present their 
cards at your business. 
Visa and Mastercard tell merchants, 
if they want to be able to accept pay-
ment from thousands of banks in their 
networks, the merchants must agree to 
Visa and Mastercard’s fees and terms. 
Take it or leave it. Only merchants 
can’t leave it. Visa and Mastercard, as 
I have said repeatedly, control 80 per-
cent of the credit and debit card mar-
ket. 
Incidentally, the figures from 2020 
show—I am going to roughly approxi-
mate these, and I will clear them up in 
the RECORD—86 billion transactions 
using debit cards, 41 billion trans-
actions using credit cards in the year 
2020. How does that compare with cash 
and check? Cash, if I remember right, 
was 32 billion compared to 120 billion 
for plastic. And what about checks? 
How many people are writing checks? 
It was 5 billion transactions compared 
to plastic, which was over 120 billion. 
The reality is, when swipe fees go 
up—and they do regularly—that cost

gets built into the price consumers pay 
at the checkout counter and at the gas 
pump. 
Remember those gas prices? You 
wonder why they are hitting $4 a gal-
lon, $5 a gallon? They include the swipe 
fees, the credit card fees, the debit card 
fees that are being added on to the cost 
of gasoline. 
Take a look at this chart. In the 16 
years between the first hearing in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee—one that 
I attended on swipe fees—and now, Visa 
and Mastercard have imposed $794 bil-
lion in swipe fees—fees passed on di-
rectly to American families and con-
sumers. That is a staggering amount— 
$794 billion, for the hidden fee you 
never see. 
Visa and Mastercard just raised these 
fees again 2 weeks ago. Senator MAR-
SHALL, my Republican colleague from 
Kansas, and I sent them a letter saying 
this is exactly the wrong time to be 
raising your fees. It is tough enough 
for these businesses trying to hire peo-
ple and get back into business after 
COVID–19, tough enough for families 
who are fighting inflation. Why do you 
have to raise them now? You are very 
profitable companies. The banks are 
doing quite well, too, I might add. 
They did it anyway. 
These fee increases are adding to in-
flation. The market can’t fix the prob-
lem because the credit and debit card 
market isn’t competitive. The retailers 
have no voice in what this fee is going 
to be. It is ‘‘take it or leave it.’’ Visa 
and Mastercard have what they call a 
duopoly—not a monopoly, one com-
pany controlling everything—but these 
two companies, Visa and Mastercard, 
control over 80 percent of the plastic 
market. 
What can we do about it? Well, in our 
hearing, we talked about several re-
sponses. First, let’s bring transparency 
to the market. The last thing that ei-
ther Visa or Mastercard want to see is 
sunlight—people understanding what 
they are charging, why they are charg-
ing, the impact it has on prices, the 
impact on inflation. They want this to 
continue to be a deep dark secret bur-
ied in 300 pages of legal gobbledygook 
that they sent to the retailers. 
If consumers knew how much their 
Visa and Mastercard purchase cost at 
the local restaurants or businesses, 
they might try using a less costly card 
and there are some out there. It would 
be like giving the business a tip, and it 
would help bring down prices. 
So why not require banks to show on 
their monthly statement that they 
send to us with their credit-debit card 
transactions how much of that was 
swipe fees? They could do it in a sec-
ond. They wouldn’t dare. They can’t 
ever embrace transparency. That is 
just about part of this process. It is all 
in secret, in code, and legal gobbledy-
gook. I will bet that would open a lot 
of eyes if you saw each month how 
much we are paying in swipe fees. 
Incidentally, Ms. Karet talked about 
her supermarket chain. She said: The 
three main expenses we have for my su-
permarket chain in Pennsylvania, Indi-
ana, and Ohio are No. 1, labor costs— 
understandable; No. 2, rent—that is un-
derstandable as well; No. 3, credit-debit 
card swipe fees. She estimated that it 
is going to cost her $1 million or more 
in her businesses based on what Visa 
and Mastercard just did two weeks ago 
to raise the fees. 
Here is another way we can reduce 
inflation. 
Let’s 
prevent 
Visa 
and 
Mastercard from hiking swipe fees up 
to unreasonable levels. 
Yesterday, I pointed out that in Can-
ada, the most commonly used debit 
card system, called Interac, operates 
with interchange fees of zero. There is 
no interchange fee. All the arguments 
that the banks and credit cards make 
in this country about why they have to 
charge these retailers these hidden fees 
disappear in Canada because why? The 
government stepped in. They said: We 
are going to regulate this. We are not 
going to let the banks and credit card- 
debit card companies dictate the poli-
cies in our country. 
They are not alone. The European 
Union did the same thing. There is a 
long list of other countries that are 
moving in that same direction. It oper-
ates quite well in these countries with 
low fraud and high consumer satisfac-
tion. 
We don’t have to eliminate inter-
change fees all together, but for good-
ness sake, we ought to make sure they 
are not excessive and not adding to in-
flation. 
There are two ways we can do it: Pro-
mote something called competition. 
Are you a dyed-in-the-wool capitalist; 
do you believe in a free market? I bet 
you believe in competition, don’t you? 
There is no competition in these fees. 
It is ‘‘take it or leave it.’’ These plastic 
companies dictate these terms to the 
retailers that honor their cards. We 
can promote competition by giving 
merchants more options on each of the 
swipes or place reasonable limits on 
their fees. Other countries, as I said, 
figured it out. Many countries around 
the world say that swipe fees are a 
fraction of the cost of what they are 
here because those nations limit Visa 
and Mastercard. 
We are afraid to tackle the giants. 
Our government and the people that 
work in this Chamber—many of them 
are frightened by the size of Visa and 
Mastercard. I didn’t get that message. 
We can do better here. If we do, con-
sumers and competition will benefit. 
The bottom line is this: If you are se-
rious about reducing costs for Amer-
ican families, get serious about reining 
in swipe fees. Visa and Mastercard 
swipe fees are adding to the fires of in-
flation every single day and they are 
doing it in secret. Is that what we want 
in our economy? Is that what Amer-
ican families need at this moment in 
history? I think not. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

SCHATZ). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
if a conservative majority on the Su-
preme Court proceeds with their abom-
inable decision to overturn Roe v. 
Wade, the rights and the freedoms of 
every woman in this country will face 
their greatest threat in generations. 
Let’s be clear. This is what the Re-
publicans want. It is in the laws Repub-
lican politicians have passed across the 
country. But the American people are 
not on their side. 
Today, I am announcing that next 
week, the U.S. Senate is going to vote 
on legislation to codify a woman’s 
right to seek an abortion into Federal 
law. Let me repeat that. I am announc-
ing that next week, the U.S. Senate is 
going to vote on legislation to codify a 
woman’s right to seek an abortion into 
Federal law. I intend to file cloture on 
this vital legislation on Monday, which 
would set up a vote for Wednesday. 
All week, we have been seeing Repub-
licans try to duck, dodge, and dip from 
their responsibility for bringing Roe to 
the brink of total repeal. That is what 
they have been trying to do for dec-
ades. Next week, the American people 
will see crystal clear that when given 
the chance to right this wrong, the Re-
publican Party will either side with the 
extremists who want to ban abortion 
without exceptions or side with women 
and with families and with the vast 
majority of Americans. 
Next week’s vote will be one of the 
most important we ever take because 
it deals with one of the most personal 
and difficult decisions a woman ever 
has to make in her life. 
This is not an abstract exercise. My 
fellow Americans, it is as real and as 
urgent as it gets. Like my friend PATTY 
MURRAY has said, this is a five-alarm 
fire. 
Senate Republicans spent years pack-
ing our courts with rightwing judges. 
Will they now own up to the harm they 
have caused or will they try to undo 
the damage? The vote next week will 
tell. Let me say that again. Repub-
licans 
spent 
years 
under 
Leader 
MCCONNELL pushing rightwing judges 
to lifetime appointments to the bench. 
They stole the nomination of Merrick 
Garland, changed the rules of the Sen-
ate, and rammed through three hard- 
right, hard-ideological judges to the 
bench. They spent years encouraging 
radical legislatures as they passed 
scores of cruel restrictions on abortion. 
One of those laws is, unfortunately, 
about to be upheld in the Supreme 
Court. 
Republicans can run, but they can’t 
hide from the horror they have created.

Republicans can run, but they can’t 
hide. They have two choices: They own 
it now or, miracle of miracles, try to 
begin to undo the damage. 
Again, to my colleagues, to my fel-
low Americans, this is not an abstract 
exercise in the slightest. Do you know 
why that is true? Because the hard 
right is not treating it like an abstract 
exercise at all. In recent years, they 
have been racing, bolting to pass un-
hinged, cruel, anti-choice legislation 
that would catapult women’s rights 
back into the stone age. They have 
been prepared for this moment for 
years. 
The Mississippi law before the Su-
preme Court, for example, has zero— 
zero—exceptions for rape or incest—a 
position that would have been regarded 
on the extreme of the extreme not too 
long ago. Imagine telling a woman who 
was raped that some White male politi-
cian is going to—White male judge is 
going to determine whether she has to 
continue to carry the child—fetus. 
In Arizona, the Governor signed a 
law that could imprison anyone who 
‘‘provides, supplies, or administers’’ an 
abortion by up to 5 years should Roe be 
overturned—again, no exception for 
rape, no exception for incest. 
The infamous law in Texas, mean-
while, bans abortions as early as 6 
weeks. Many women don’t realize they 
are pregnant until after 6 weeks, and, 
again, no exception for rape, no excep-
tion for incest. 
Unfortunately, these are not aberra-
tions. Twenty-six States have laws on 
the books that would begin the process 
of banning abortions if Roe is over-
turned. Thirteen of these are trigger 
laws, meaning these bans would happen 
almost immediately after the Supreme 
Court decision. 
This, it seems, is what the hard right 
wants—forced pregnancies, no excep-
tion for rape, no exception for incest. 
Republican 
politicians 
are 
telling 
America’s women: Your body, our 
choice. 
We cannot allow this vision of Amer-
ica to succeed. Come next week, Senate 
Republicans will have to answer for ev-
erything they have done over the years 
to embolden the hard right’s hostility 
against a woman’s choice. They have 
tried to hide what they are doing. They 
tried to downplay what they are doing. 
Those days are over. 
You are coming clean—not clean, 
really, at all. Everyone is going to 
know what you have done and how you 
feel. 
Leader MCCONNELL can duck at press 
conferences when asked if he is happy 
to see Roe v. Wade go by the wayside, 
but he won’t be able to duck it any 
longer. 
So our view is that America cannot 
allow this vision of America to suc-
ceed. Come next week, Senate Repub-
licans will have to answer for every-
thing they have done over the years to 
embolden the hard right’s hostility 
against a woman’s choice. They will 
not be able to hide from the American 
people. They cannot hide their role in 
bringing Roe to an end. The vote will 
tell next week. America will be watch-
ing. 
AMERICA COMPETES ACT 
Mr. President, now on a different 
note, last night, the Senate took an-
other important step towards finalizing 
our bipartisan jobs and competition 
legislation that has been in the works 
for over a year. I thank all my col-
leagues last night for voting swiftly to 
process 26 motions to instruct the con-
ference committee. Many of these were 
done by voice, and I appreciate every-
one’s hard work. We sat in our seats. 
No one, at noon yesterday, with 26 mo-
tions to instruct, thought we would fin-
ish by 10 p.m. or even at any point yes-
terday, but we did. That is good work. 
There is still a lot of work to do, of 
course, before we send the jobs bill to 
the President’s desk, and I hope we will 
see the same bipartisan, good-faith 
work in the conference that we saw 
last night on the floor of the Senate. 
We all know that no one is going to get 
everything they want, but if we keep 
working together, I am confident we 
can come up with a strong final prod-
uct. 
Our jobs and competition bill is just 
what the doctor ordered to boost our 
economy, bring manufacturing jobs 
back home, and most of all, lower costs 
for American families. 
It is great news for American fami-
lies who want to see lower costs on 
daily essentials. It is great news for 
workers who want to see good-paying 
manufacturing jobs brought back from 
overseas. It is great news for our busi-
nesses that need help strengthening 
our supply chains. It is great news for 
our innovators, workers, scientists, 
universities, and creators who will help 
us create new technologies and gen-
erate the next wave of good-paying jobs 
in this century. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle who worked in good faith 
to help us reach this point. 
WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION 
Mr. President, one final note: pro-
tecting pregnant working women. As 
we all continue reckoning with the im-
plications of the Supreme Court’s hor-
rible decision—the one that seems to 
be coming down the pike—the Senate 
must also support the needs of preg-
nant women facing discrimination in 
the workplace. 
Recently, the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions re-
ported 
bipartisan 
legislation 
that 
would prevent employers from forcing 
pregnant workers out of a job or deny-
ing them reasonable accommodations 
in the workplace. In the House, a simi-
lar bill also passed with strong bipar-
tisan support, and the Senate should do 
the same. 
Mother’s Day is just around the cor-
ner—happy Mother’s Day to my mom 
of 93—Mother’s Day is just around the 
corner, so I call on my colleagues to fi-
nalize strong bipartisan legislation 
that will make a meaningful difference 
in the lives of millions of working 
pregnant women. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it is Na-
tional Small Business Week, a week 
that is set aside to honor the contribu-
tions that small businesses make to 
this Nation. 
Small businesses are an essential 
part of our economy. Ninety-nine per-
cent—99 percent—of South Dakota’s 
businesses are small businesses, and al-
most 60 percent of South Dakota em-
ployees work for small businesses. 
Nationally, small businesses make up 
most of the businesses in this country 
and are responsible for 62 percent of 
net new job creation. 
And small businesses are not only an 
essential part of our economy, they are 
also an essential part of our commu-
nities—doing everything from creating 
gathering spaces for community mem-
bers to supporting local charities and 
sponsoring local sports teams. 
During 
National 
Small 
Business 
Week, I would like to be able to report 
that small businesses around the coun-
try are thriving. But the truth is, while 
some are doing well, a lot of small 
businesses are having a difficult time 
right now, not because of COVID, as 
Democrats might like you to think, 
but because of inflation. Inflation, 
which has hit American families hard, 
is also creating major difficulties for 
small businesses. 
Now, when I talk to small business 
owners in South Dakota, one of the 
first things they tell me is how infla-
tion is affecting their businesses. 
In a recent survey from the National 
Federation of Independent Business, 62 
percent of small businesses reported 
that inflation is having a substantial 
impact on their businesses, and 84 per-
cent reported that they are experi-
encing lower business earnings due to 
inflation, and it is no surprise. 
Inflation has driven up the final price 
of goods and services. It has also driven 
up the cost of raw materials. 
The producer price index, which 
measures wholesale costs to sellers, hit 
11.2 percent in March—its highest level 
ever recorded. 
And small businesses are struggling 
with high energy costs, which affect 
everything from production to the 
transportation of finished products to 
the cost of keeping a storefront open. 
Farms and ranches, which make up a 
substantial part of South Dakota’s 
small businesses, are seeing huge price 
increases in the cost of essential in-
puts, like fertilizer, while the price of 
diesel, which powers farm equipment, 
reached an all-time high this week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2348 
May 5, 2022 
Agriculture is already a challenging 
industry by its very nature. Many 
farmers and ranchers in South Dakota, 
for example, are currently dealing with 
a severe drought, and inflation is mak-
ing things a lot worse, especially right 
now in the midst of planting season. 
We all know how we got here. Demo-
crats came into office last year mere 
weeks after Congress had passed a fifth 
bipartisan COVID relief bill totaling 
more than $900 billion, and meeting es-
sentially all of the current pressing 
COVID needs. 
It was abundantly clear that we were 
not in immediate need of trillions more 
in government spending. 
But that didn’t matter to Democrats. 
Now that they were in charge, they 
were eager to take advantage of the 
COVID crisis to begin implementing 
their Big Government vision. 
And so in the name of ‘‘COVID re-
lief,’’ they pushed through a massive 
partisan $1.9 trillion piece of legisla-
tion filled with unnecessary spending 
and handouts to Democrat interest 
groups. 
And the result was entirely predict-
able. 
The definition of inflation is too 
many dollars chasing too few goods and 
services, and that was exactly the situ-
ation that Democrats helped create. 
Democrats flooded the economy with 
unnecessary government money and 
the economy overheated as a result, 
and there is no clear end in sight. 
It is small wonder that, after months 
and months of high inflation and anti- 
growth policies from the Biden admin-
istration, our economy shrank in the 
first quarter of this year. 
Unfortunately, there is no easy solu-
tion to the inflation crisis Democrats 
helped create. 
One essential thing, of course, is to 
do no more harm, and that means no 
more excessive government spending 
and no bloated Build Back Better tax- 
and-spending spree, a spending spree 
that some Democrats are still—still— 
advocating for. 
Another essential thing is to unleash 
American energy production, and that 
includes conventional energy produc-
tion. 
I am a strong supporter of clean en-
ergy. I come from a State that, in 2020, 
derived 83 percent of its energy genera-
tion from renewables. 
But no matter how much Democrats 
and the President might wish it were 
otherwise, the fact of the matter is 
that our Nation is nowhere close to 
being able to eliminate our reliance on 
traditional energy sources. Clean en-
ergy technology is simply not advanced 
to the point where we can replace all 
conventional energy production with 
renewables. And cutting off investment 
in clean, responsible oil and gas pro-
duction will do nothing but drive up 
energy prices for American families, 
farms, and businesses. 
Unleashing American energy produc-
tion, on the other hand—including, I 
might add, production of oil and nat-
ural gas—could quickly result in relief 
for families and businesses and help 
ease our inflation crisis. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
President 
has 
made his hostility to conventional en-
ergy production very clear. He set the 
tone on day 1 of his administration 
when he cancelled the Keystone XL 
Pipeline, an environmentally respon-
sible pipeline project that was already 
underway and that was paired with $1.7 
billion in private investment in renew-
able energy to fully offset its operating 
emissions. The Keystone Pipeline was 
set to be what they call ‘‘net zero’’— 
net zero—when it comes to emissions. 
The President also immediately froze 
new oil and gas leases on Federal lands. 
And while his administration is finally 
conducting sales for new onshore oil 
and gas leases after being ordered to do 
so by a Federal judge, it has reduced 
the land available for such leases and 
substantially increased the royalty 
rate, sending a loud and clear signal to 
American energy producers that the 
administration is reluctant to collabo-
rate with them. 
Meanwhile, the Securities and Ex-
change Commission has proposed re-
quiring publicly-traded companies to 
comply with costly new climate-re-
lated disclosures that would likely dis-
courage investment in conventional 
energy production. 
In short, the Biden administration is 
creating a recipe for sustained high en-
ergy costs and a lot more pain for 
American businesses and families. 
But I and my Republican colleagues 
will continue to do everything we can 
to unleash conventional energy produc-
tion here at home and drive down en-
ergy prices for Americans. 
I am grateful for all that small busi-
nesses contribute to our economy, and 
during this National Small Business 
Week, and every week, I will continue 
to work to mitigate the harm of Demo-
crats’ inflation crisis and advance poli-
cies that make it easier for our small 
businessmen and -women to continue 
to drive the American economy for-
ward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Texas. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know 
we are used to having a lot going on 
here in Washington, DC, but this week 
seems like we have been hit by a whirl-
wind of activity—a war in Europe, 
COVID–19 still lingering in parts of the 
world, and then the Supreme Court 
found itself the victim of an unauthor-
ized leak of a draft opinion, which has 
created a lot of furor and anxiety and 
misinformation. 
One of the things that it has dem-
onstrated is the need to protect the 
independence of the Court. 
Justice Antonin Scalia used to say 
that you can read the constitution and 
bill of rights of a lot of countries 
around the world, and they look great 
on paper. He mentioned that of the old 
Soviet Union, for example. But he said 
they are just words on paper without 
an independent judiciary to enforce 
them, and he was right. 
Whoever leaked this draft document 
obviously intended to create a lot of 
public pressure—indeed, coercion—on 
the sitting Justices to either change 
their minds or to somehow garner a po-
litical issue that they would be able to 
use to divert the American people’s at-
tention from things like inflation, 
crime, the border, and the challenges 
to our national security and world 
peace. 
We have to get to the bottom of this, 
and I am confident that Chief Justice 
Roberts will pursue that until the per-
son who leaked it is identified and held 
accountable. 
But this spotlight on the Court, 
along with the reaction—the public re-
action that we have seen has raised an-
other important issue, and that is the 
physical safety and security of the Jus-
tices themselves and their families. 
In our increasingly polarized climate, 
the Justices have been villainized and 
subjected to violent threats. People 
have even published their home ad-
dresses so they can show up and protest 
on their home, on their property, on 
their lawns. 
This decision, which is actually a 
nondecision 
because 
the 
Supreme 
Court hasn’t handed down its deci-
sion—but the leaker has accomplished 
his or her goal, I suppose, by creating 
this hostile environment for the Jus-
tices and their families. 
But, unfortunately, there are even 
people in this Chamber who have con-
tributed to that environment. 
In 2019, the Democratic leader went 
to the Supreme Court steps and threat-
ened two Supreme Court Justices by 
name. He said: 
You have released the whirlwind— 
By the way, this was the day that the 
abortion case was argued in the Su-
preme Court. 
The senior Senator from New York, 
the majority leader, said: 
You have released the whirlwind, and you 
will pay the price. You won’t know what hit 
you if you go forward with these awful deci-
sions. 
And he named Justice Gorsuch and 
Justice Kavanaugh by name. 
Now, to have the senior Democrat 
and Senate majority leader from this 
Chamber lobbing threats at sitting 
Justices on the Supreme Court if they 
did not rule in a way he wished is dan-
gerous. 
We have wondered before about the 
impact of some of the irresponsible 
rhetoric 
that 
occasionally 
occurs 
around here on vulnerable minds and 
people who might be tempted to act 
based on that incitement, based on 
that rhetoric. But to have this come 
from the majority leader himself is 
just irresponsible. 
This is the branch of government, 
which is supposed to be the adults in 
the room, to operate in a way that is 
respectful, even with our differences, 
and the Supreme Court is the branch

that is meant to operate free from pub-
lic or political pressure. 
As Chief Justice Roberts said at the 
time: ‘‘Justices know that criticism 
comes with the territory.’’ It is a free 
country. People can express themselves 
within limits. ‘‘But threatening state-
ments,’’ he said, ‘‘of this sort from the 
highest levels of government are not 
only 
inappropriate, 
they 
are 
dan-
gerous,’’ he said. Well, Chief Justice 
Roberts is right, and subsequent events 
have shown that threats against the 
Justices aren’t going away and are be-
coming even more intense. 
We need to take steps to improve the 
protection of the Justices and their 
family against potential violence, and 
it can’t wait until something bad hap-
pens. Some political activists have al-
ready announced their intentions to go 
to the private homes of the Justices. 
This is an appalling violation of their 
personal privacy. It puts them and 
their families at risk. We currently 
have two Justices with school-aged 
children. Once Judge Jackson joins the 
Court when Justice Breyer steps down, 
there will be three. 
The Chief Justice has asked Congress 
to take appropriate action to increase 
protection for the physical safety of 
the Justices and their families, and we 
need to act and act with urgency. 
Senator COONS, our friend from Dela-
ware, a Democrat, and I are intro-
ducing a bill, a bipartisan bill, obvi-
ously, called the Supreme Court Police 
Parity Act to strengthen security pro-
tection for the Justices and their fami-
lies. This will ensure the Justices re-
ceive the same protection and re-
sources that article I and article II offi-
cers and their families enjoy. For our 
present purposes, that means they will 
be given the same authority that the 
Capitol Police already have here on 
Capitol Hill. 
I appreciate our friend Senator COONS 
working with me on this important 
legislation, and I hope the entire Sen-
ate will vote on it soon. 
As far as the larger debate about the 
draft document that was released, it is 
important to remember we don’t actu-
ally know what the Supreme Court is 
going to decide until it actually does 
decide. The Justices are still working 
through the deliberative process, and 
our respect for the independence of the 
Court requires that we let it proceed 
without interference. 
While tensions and emotions may be 
high, it is important to note that over-
ruling earlier Supreme Court decisions 
is nothing new. I looked back and real-
ized it was 1789 when the Supreme 
Court reversed its first prior decision. 
Since that time, there have been 232 in-
stances where an earlier Supreme 
Court decision was overturned. And, I 
must say, thank goodness the Court is 
willing, 
under 
some 
limited 
cir-
cumstances, to revisit its earlier deci-
sions. 
The Court’s decisions overruling ear-
lier precedents in some cases has fun-
damentally altered major aspects of 
our society. Without question one of 
the most notable was Brown v. Board 
of Education. Now, Brown v. Board of 
Education was a landmark ruling over-
ruling a case called Plessy v. Ferguson, 
which established a shameful ‘‘separate 
but equal’’ doctrine between Blacks 
and Whites in public transportation 
and public schools. Brown said that is 
fundamentally discriminatory and will 
not stand because it doesn’t meet the 
constitutional standards. But it is 
tough today to imagine what our coun-
try would look like had the Supreme 
Court not reached its decision in 
Brown nearly 70 years ago. Classrooms, 
restrooms, water fountains, and even 
healthcare facilities would be des-
ignated by race. I am confident that I 
can speak for everyone in this Chamber 
when I say thank goodness the Court 
overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and 
reached the ruling that it did in Brown 
v. Board of Education. 
There are more modern examples 
where the Court overruled precedent, 
like Lawrence v. Texas was overruled 
in 2003 by the precedent established by 
Bowers v. Hardwick, which had made it 
a crime to be engaged in same-sex con-
duct. So without a doubt, the Court’s 
decision to overturn its precedents has 
altered our society, and I suggest it has 
changed our society for the better in 
many of those instances. 
Now, I realize that given our political 
and ideological preferences, we might 
like or dislike the decision that the 
Court ultimately makes, but former 
Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson 
said years ago that the Supreme Court 
is not final because it is right; it is 
right, he said, because it is final. 
But there is no such thing as an invi-
olable decision or permanent decision 
by the Supreme Court, and again I say 
thank goodness. If prior decisions were 
set in stone, we would still be subject 
to egregious, shameful policies of the 
past like ‘‘separate but equal.’’ But the 
Supreme Court should always try to 
correct previously decided erroneous 
decisions, and they have criteria under 
the doctrine known as stare decisis for 
the circumstances under which they 
will revisit that precedent. The Court 
understands that they can’t willy-nilly 
overrule earlier decisions, and there is 
a very elaborate and exacting process 
and evaluation of analysis by which 
they do so. 
But I believe it is our responsibility 
here in the Senate not to be part of the 
mob. Cooler heads must prevail. And 
that means us. It starts with us. We 
have to stand for the independence of 
the Court even when they render deci-
sions we don’t like. That is the only 
way to preserve the crown jewels of our 
form of government, which is the inde-
pendent judiciary. The High Court can-
not be subjected to pressure campaigns

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
NATIONAL BEEF MONTH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is 
my pleasure to celebrate with my col-
leagues the month of May as National 
Beef Month, and I come to the floor not 
just to say that we ought to eat more 
beef and help the farmers and cattle-
men of this country. 
Before I get to something else, 
though, Iowa has the seventh largest 
cattle inventory in the United States 
and ranks fourth in the country for 
cattle and calves on feed. While I usu-
ally focus on the need for a fair and 
transparent market for cattle pro-
ducers, today I want to draw attention 
to the job that cattle producers across 
the country have feeding America and 
the world. 
Over the last 30 years, the U.S. popu-
lation has increased by 80 million peo-
ple. In that same period, the world’s 
population has grown by more than 3 
billion people. In the face of a growing 
population, farmers across America 
have been faced with a challenging 
question: How do we meet the growing 
demands for food while also lowering 
our environmental footprint? 
American farmers and ranchers have 
risen to that occasion; in other words, 
not just producing more food but help-
ing the environment at the same time. 
Farmers in all segments have expanded 
production to fulfill increasing demand 
while protecting our environment. The 
United States is currently producing 80 
percent more pork, 48 percent more 
milk, and 18 percent more beef than 
just 30 years ago. 
Now, you would think, with all that 
increase in production, you would have 
more of an environmental problem, but 
despite the increases in production, per 
unit greenhouse gas emissions from 
pork production have decreased by 20 
percent and 8 percent for beef produc-
tion. 
Nonetheless, environmentalists still 
seem to place unwarranted blame on 
farmers for contributing to our chang-
ing and warming climate. The recent 
narrative that U.S. agriculture is a 
major contributor to greenhouse gas 
emissions is simply not true. Now get 
that—it is simply not true. According 
to the EPA, only 11 percent of U.S. 
greenhouse gas emissions come from 
agriculture. The leading sources of 
greenhouse gas emissions contribute 
nearly twice as many emissions as the 
agriculture industry does. Transpor-
tation contributes 27 percent, elec-
tricity contributes 25 percent, general 
industry is contributing 24 percent. So 
I am here to set the record straight. 
For the last 30 years, American farm-
ers have been reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions with each meal served by 
embracing efficiency and the adoption 
of new technologies. 
Agriculture needs to have a seat at 
the table for these conversations be-
cause farmers are the first conserva-
tionists and can help offset emissions 
from other sectors of the American 
economy. Whether it is creating carbon 
sinks on farmland to produce biofuels

or turning farm waste into energy, 
farmers have taken a very active role 
in reducing the environmental impact 
of agriculture. 
Research from the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture shows that even if the 
entire world was vegan, it would lower 
global emissions by less than one-half 
of 1 percent, while losing access to 
high-quality protein very much needed 
in the diets of human beings. 
However, the facts that I have men-
tioned do not matter to radical envi-
ronmental groups or the mainstream 
media. Articles on food sustainability 
often focus on how eating insects and 
bugs can help save the planet. A simple 
search on the internet reveals some un-
settling articles in our publications. A 
headline from Time magazine reads 
like this: ‘‘How Humans Eating Insects 
Could Help Save the Planet.’’ 
Then from the publication The At-
lantic: ‘‘To Save the World, Eat Bugs.’’ 
And from the New York Times—can 
you imagine, the New York Times: 
‘‘Why Aren’t We Eating More Insects?’’ 
All of these stories have a very com-
mon thread—to solve world hunger and 
to protect the environment, the Amer-
ican people and the world need to eat 
bugs and insects. But as I have already 
laid out, you can just eat more beef 
and feel good about the environmental 
impact. 
Now, as for me, I will be doing my 
part in May to honor National Beef 
Month. I will be eating juicy ham-
burgers or eating steak, if the price 
isn’t too outrageous—and it is right 
now. I will be supporting cattlemen 
from Iowa who produce the highest 
quality beef in the world. Farmers 
know firsthand the importance of a 
clean and healthy environment. It is 
simply unfair to place the blame of a 
changing climate on the backs of farm-
ers. 
As a nation, we must stand with the 
farmers across the country and work 
with them to promote a clean environ-
ment. I will continue working at the 
policymaking table to ensure our cat-
tle producers can continue raising 
high-quality beef for generations to 
come and that families can enjoy it at 
their kitchen tables at prices they can 
afford. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
STAND WITH TAIWAN ACT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
wanted to come down to talk about a 
topic that a number of Senators have 
been talking about and that a number 
of Senators have been focused on. That 
is the topic of Taiwan and potentially 
the defense of Taiwan and the support 
for Taiwan. 
As this body knows, in 1979, the Sen-
ate passed a very important bill called 
the Taiwan Relations Act—a very bi-
partisan bill. From that time on, the 
Senate has played a very important 
oversight role in U.S. relations with 
Taiwan, and it has always been very bi-
partisan. 
Recently, a bipartisan codel, led by 
the chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, Senator MENENDEZ, with 
many other Senators—Senator GRA-
HAM, 
Senator 
PORTMAN, 
Senator 
SASSE—traveled to Taiwan. I just got 
an out-brief from some of those Sen-
ators—a very good meeting. I was part 
of a bipartisan codel about a year ago, 
with 
Senator 
COONS
and 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH, also to Taiwan. 
So there is a long tradition in the 
U.S. Senate, in a bipartisan way, with 
all of us working together, of address-
ing this question: To what degree 
should we be supporting and defending 
Taiwan against a very aggressive Chi-
nese Communist Party, led by the dic-
tator Xi Jinping? Why does it matter? 
Why should we all be working together, 
as we have done for decades here in the 
U.S. Senate, Democrats and Repub-
licans, to deter a military invasion of 
Taiwan? 
What will be happening in the next 
few weeks I want to talk about because 
I am concerned about the direction of 
the Biden administration, and I think 
every Senator here should be con-
cerned. So I am going to ask my col-
leagues to lift up their voices when 
they talk to the Biden administration 
on a topic I am going to mention here 
in a minute. But why does it matter? 
Well, this issue of the potential inva-
sion of Taiwan could take place in a 
few years. 
The INDOPACOM commander, a lit-
tle over a year ago, in front of the 
Armed Services Committee, opined 
that the threat of an invasion of Tai-
wan by an aggressive Chinese Com-
munist Party would manifest itself 
during this decade—‘‘in fact, in the 
next 6 years.’’ That was Admiral Da-
vidson, 
former 
INDOPACOM 
com-
mander, and that is not a lot of time. 
Here is why I think it matters: Right 
now, Taiwan is on the frontline of free-
dom in Asia. It is not some peripheral 
sideshow; it is, in many ways, central 
to freedom in that part of the world 
like West Berlin was during the Cold 
War. A violent military takeover of 
Taiwan by the Chinese Communist 
Party would be a sea change in how the 
entire world is ordered. It would 
change the history of the 21st century 
in the way that the Guns of August of 
1914 changed the 20th century. 
Now, some see the defense of Taiwan 
and the support that is required from 
the United States because of the Tai-
wan Relations Act—again, led by this 
body—some see the defense and support 
of this island democracy as a luxury 
that we can’t afford in an age shaped 
by great power competition. 
I actually believe—and I believe 
many Senators, Democrats and Repub-
licans, believe the opposite—that a 
Taiwan under China’s control would 
decisively advance Beijing’s campaign 
to 
export 
its 
authoritarian 
model 
around the world; to separate the 
United States from our democratic al-
lies; and it would certainly be part of 
Xi Jinping’s goal of excluding the 
United States from the INDOPACOM 
theater. 
Taiwan—a thriving, prosperous Chi-
nese democracy that holds free elec-
tion and bounds its power by the rule 
of law—is central to the free world and 
its future. 
By the way, if you are an American 
citizen, regardless of political party, 
you should take pride in the fact that 
this country—or this island democ-
racy—is free because it wouldn’t have 
happened without the sacrifice and re-
sources of the United States and our 
military, and that is a fact. 
A few months ago, I gave a speech on 
this topic, and I talked about how, 
when you think of the defense of Tai-
wan and deterrence, which is what we 
all want—deterrence; nobody wants a 
war in the Taiwan Strait—there are 
really three layers of deterrence for the 
island of Taiwan. 
The first is Taiwan’s ability to mili-
tarily 
defend 
itself, 
the 
so-called 
hedgehog approach or porcupine ap-
proach. Right here, they are defending 
themselves in the way the Ukrainians 
are 
defending 
themselves. 
Senator 
ROGER WICKER had a very good op-ed in 
the Wall Street Journal just today on 
that very topic. We need to make sure 
Taiwan has that capability—it is in the 
Taiwan Relations Act that we have 
that responsibility—so that it can de-
fend itself, and they are undertaking 
the right approach with regard to the 
military weapons they are buying from 
the United States and other places. 
The second level of deterrence that 
you see here on this chart would be 
America’s capability to defend Taiwan 
militarily should the President of the 
United States decide to do so if there is 
an invasion by the Chinese Communist 
Party. Over several decades, through 
many different crises in the Taiwan 
Strait, this layer of deterrence, where-
in the United States has shown up with 
military force, has proven to be deci-
sive in keeping the Taiwanese people 
free, and our deep network of allies in 
the region augments this second level 
of deterrence. 
But there is also a third level of de-
terrence. The third level of deterrence 
is often not discussed, but in many 
ways, particularly now, it could be 
more powerful than the first and sec-
ond levels, and that is the level that re-
lates to bringing in the instruments of 
American power beyond our military, 
such as our global economic and finan-
cial strengths, to deter China from an 
invasion. You see this third level: eco-
nomic and financial sanctions. 
This is exactly what my bipartisan 
bill, the STAND with Taiwan Act, 
would do. I am working with several 
Senators on this bill right now. We

S2351 
May 5, 2022 
have introduced it already, but we are 
going to recalibrate it, particularly 
with regard to the lessons learned from 
Ukraine. 
One of those lessons that we learned 
from the brutal Ukrainian invasion by 
the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin in 
Ukraine is that comprehensive eco-
nomic and financial sanctions have the 
best chance of deterring a conflict 
when they are clearly articulated and 
ready to go before the conflict begins. 
That wasn’t the case in Ukraine, and 
we will never know, had sanctions al-
ready been teed up and ready to go, if 
they could have deterred that conflict. 
With the STAND with Taiwan Act, 
which stands for Sanctions Targeting 
Aggressors 
of 
Neighboring 
Democ-
racies—STAND—the whole point of 
this would be to deter Xi Jinping from 
making the decision. That third layer 
of deterrence is saying: OK. If you mili-
tarily invade Taiwan, here are the mas-
sive sanctions that we and our allies 
are going to hit you with, and they will 
be devastating. 
This bill makes it clear that we 
should be engaging with Taiwan eco-
nomically, across the board, in many 
sectors. And this is where I have deep 
concern—and I believe many of my col-
leagues here in the U.S. Senate have 
deep 
concerns—about 
the 
direction 
that might be happening with regard to 
the Biden administration. 
Now, look, I am somebody who, you 
know, will be critical of the Biden ad-
ministration when I think they are not 
doing a good job on certain things. And 
I do that a lot, particularly on a topic 
I am going to talk about here in a 
minute, energy. But in other areas, 
particularly as it relates to the Biden 
administration’s relationship with re-
gard to our allies and Taiwan, I have 
been supportive of a number of their 
initiatives vocally because I think they 
have strengthened American interests 
in the INDOPACOM theater. What are 
those? 
Well, for example, the Biden adminis-
tration took this initiative from the 
Trump 
administration—it 
actually 
started in the Bush administration— 
called the Quad. That is the biggest de-
mocracies in the INDOPACOM theater: 
us, Japan, Australia, and India. They 
have taken that grouping, which, dur-
ing the Trump administration, was re-
invigorated, particularly by Secretary 
Pompeo, at the minister level, and the 
Biden administration has taken that to 
the leader level. The President of the 
United States meets with the leaders of 
Japan, Australia, and India on a reg-
ular basis. That is good. That is smart 
policy. 
They have also launched another 
very innovative policy, the Australia- 
UK-U.S. agreement to work together 
on military and defense issues: sub-
marines, nuclear subs, AI, quantum 
computing. It is called the Arcus ini-
tiative. I think it is a really innovative 
initiative, and I have been very—one of 
the most vocal supporters of it in the 
U.S. Senate. 
The Biden administration has also 
been pressing the G–7 to do more as it 
relates to Taiwan—the first time ever 
in the G–7. That is a good initiative. 
In a lot of these areas, I have been 
supportive. So what am I concerned 
about? 
This is a concern I have, but it 
should be a concern that every Senator 
has. The administration is getting 
ready to announce what they are call-
ing the Indo-Pacific economic frame-
work. This is going to focus on more 
economic engagement with our allies 
in other countries in the INDOPACOM 
theater. OK. I support that in general. 
We will see what the details are. But 
right now, that initiative, which we 
need in terms of an initiative with re-
gard to economics and other elements 
of connectivity with our allies in the 
region, appears to be on the verge of 
missing two critical factors. 
No. 1, and the real purpose of what I 
wanted to talk about, right now, we are 
hearing from administration officials 
that the Indo-Pacific economic frame-
work is going to exclude Taiwan. 
Whoa. Whoa. That would not be a good 
thing, and I don’t think many U.S. 
Senators—Democrats or Republicans— 
would agree that the Biden administra-
tion’s first big economic initiative is 
going to exclude Taiwan, a very impor-
tant economic player, very important 
technical player in terms of chip fab-
rication. Why would they do that? 
Well, it is not clear. 
I have been pressing a number of 
Biden administration officials saying, 
you can’t make that move. A, the Sen-
ate is not going to like it. And we have 
had a lot to say about U.S. relations 
with Taiwan for decades. And, B, it 
just doesn’t make sense. 
Some of the things I have heard is, 
well, there is this argument that trade 
is really not national security, so it 
doesn’t relate to Taiwan. Well, that is 
not correct. Trade and economic issues 
are clearly national security issues as 
it relates to our country, as it relates 
to our allies. 
The other thing I have heard is that, 
well, some of the other countries in the 
Indo-Pacific framework don’t really 
want Taiwan in it. Again, we are the 
United States. We are the leader in 
that part of the world. If another coun-
try is saying, hey, I don’t want Taiwan 
in it, you know, I think we need to po-
litely tell them that, too bad. They are 
going to be. 
So I am primarily giving these re-
marks right now to let all of my Sen-
ate colleagues, many of whom—Demo-
crats and Republicans—I know care 
about this issue. 
I have been trying to raise the alarm 
with the administration, saying, bad 
idea if your big, first economic initia-
tive for the INDOPACOM theater is not 
going to include Taiwan. I hope other 
colleagues of mine will do the same. 
Let me give you one final area that 
this administration should be focused 
on as it relates to our partners in the 
region, and that is energy—that is en-
ergy. We have so many opportunities 
to do more with our allies—of course, 
in Europe but also in Asia—as it re-
lates to energy. 
I put forward legislation called the 
Quad energy initiative that would be 
an initiative dealing with the export 
and importation of LNG. Think about 
the Quad: the United States and Aus-
tralia, two of the biggest exporters of 
LNG; Japan, probably the world’s big-
gest importer; and India, who wants to 
be to help their economy, to help their 
environment. This is something else I 
have been pressing this administration 
on. 
It will help our trade deficits, it will 
help our energy security, and—you 
know I have talked about this a lot—it 
will help global emissions. The United 
States right now, since 2005, has been 
the leader in reducing global green-
house gas emissions, right there. The 
climb-down was 15 percent since 2005. 
India, China, everywhere else, signifi-
cant increases; more American clean 
burning LNG to our allies in the re-
gion, the Quad. But, heck, even China 
would help us, our national security, 
our workers at home, and our environ-
ment and the global environment. 
I just want to end with this: I hope 
all of my Senate colleagues in the next 
couple of days can reach out to the 
Biden administration and say: Look, 
on a number of initiatives—the Quad, 
Arcus—you have been going in the 
right direction, and you have strong bi-
partisan support. But the INDOPACOM 
economic framework led by the United 
States, if it is leaving out Taiwan, that 
is going to be a huge problem, and I 
don’t think many U.S. Senators think 
that that would be a good idea. 
Given our long history of leading in a 
bipartisan way on issues related to Tai-
wan, I am asking my colleagues to also 
reach out to the administration and 
say, there has to be a better way. We 
cannot economically isolate and forget 
about Taiwan when we need to be sup-
porting them now more than ever. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1195 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, on 
April 16, 2021, the House passed H.R. 
1195, the Workplace Violence Preven-
tion for Healthcare and Social Service 
Workers Act. That legislation, spon-
sored by Congressman JOE COURTNEY, 
passed the House 254 to 166 with the 
support of 38 Republicans. 
This legislation directs the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administra-
tion to issue a standard requiring 
healthcare and social service employ-
ers to write and implement a work-
place violence prevention plan to pro-
tect employees from violent incidents. 
In the year since that legislation 
passed the House, we have been unable 
to generate the same level of support 
from our Republican colleagues needed 
to pass this legislation in the Senate. 
This is disappointing because the issue

service workers has never been more 
important. 
Roughly 
three-quarters 
of 
all 
nonfatal workplace injuries happen to 
healthcare workers. 
While it is too early to have com-
prehensive data from the pandemic, 
evidence from healthcare organizations 
suggests that workplace violence has 
exploded during the pandemic, nearing 
crisis levels for healthcare and social 
service workers. This workplace vio-
lence crisis is surely contributing to 
the 
staffing 
shortages 
that 
many 
healthcare employers have warned us 
about. 
In 
Wisconsin, 
vacancy 
rates 
for 
healthcare positions have been increas-
ing, and threats against healthcare 
workers are viewed as the main culprit. 
These workers care for our loved ones 
and comfort us in our most trying 
times. They deserve to have the safe 
environment in which to do their work 
that this legislation provides. 
So as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 1195 and that 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration; that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Reserving the right to 
object, I come from the business world 
and know firsthand that employers 
care about their employees. If you 
don’t keep your workplace safe—we 
just discussed it today in the Budget 
hearing—they are not going to stick 
with you. I think the question is about 
how you address those issues. I am 
married to a lifelong business owner in 
our hometown downtown that would 
say the same thing. 
None of us who own businesses 
think—unless you get very, maybe 
large, where you think you don’t need 
to pay attention to basic common 
sense and the rules—you need some-
thing, I think, that addresses the issue 
from here. 
You know, I think that so often when 
there is an issue, there is just a tend-
ency to reflex to the Federal Govern-
ment. What is not considered are the 
costs and how it might actually play 
out. 
In this case, I do acknowledge the 
issue, but I think the bill is in search 
of maybe a problem in the sense that 
we have got a mechanism that already 
works. I will talk about that here in a 
moment. 
OSHA is there to find these issues 
and adjudicate them accordingly, and I 
think what this would do is not lend 
the marginal benefit and would end up, 
like many bills, adding redtape and 
costs. 
It has two budget points of order as 
well. Those are complicated. I just be-
lieve there are better options. 
Let me talk about this: I introduced 
the Voluntary Protection Program Act 
that has the same approach in mind, 
aiming at the same problem. I did it 
with my colleague from Colorado, Sen-
ator BENNET. It allows OSHA to work 
alongside employers and workers to en-
courage 
businesses 
without 
going 
through the redtape or the dictate of 
the Federal Government, and it has 
been successful. 
It is not like we are trying to re-
invent the wheel. It makes businesses 
exempt 
from 
bureaucratic 
require-
ments as long as, in good faith, they 
are trying to address the underlying 
issues. 
Look at this. In its current form, it 
safeguards nearly 1 million workers, 
700 local unions, and 2,200 worksites. 
VPP sites have shown injury and ill-
ness rates 50 percent lower than their 
industry averages. 
This is something that we should be 
incorporating across the system be-
cause it is working, and it is working 
with an enforcement Agency and busi-
nesses solving the problem before we 
give an overall framework from here 
down. 
It has been around for over 40 years, 
demonstrated its success. I think it 
would be a better approach to a prob-
lem. I acknowledge it is just not being 
used broadly enough. After all, it is 
kind of the way I think things should 
work first before you create a law. 
I will ask for consent here shortly to 
pass the VPP Act. Let me add one im-
portant note that is personal to many 
in this Chamber. The 116th Congress 
was my first as a U.S. Senator, as a 
freshman. I was assigned to the Senate 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions, and I had the 
great honor to serve alongside Senator 
Mike Enzi, who was the chair of the 
Budget Committee. This was his bill. 
Senator Enzi was known as one of the 
individuals here never to shirk an issue 
but come up with commonsense ways 
that wouldn’t add further to our debt, 
add more bureaucracy, but still solve 
the issue. This bill addresses a program 
that he cared about deeply that needs 
to be put into statute, to where it is 
used more broadly, and I was honored 
to take the lead on this act, along with 
Senator BENNET. 
My bill is a no-brainer. Employers 
get the choice to participate. It has a 
proven track record, and it makes 
workplaces safer. It is a win-win for all 
involved. 
Therefore, I do object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, obvi-
ously, I am very disappointed, and I 
would point out that a voluntary meas-
ure, as my colleague on the HELP 
Committee just described, is not what 
we need when we step up to help pro-
tect our frontline workers in emer-
gency rooms and in multiple settings 
where there is, sadly, an increasing 
propensity for violence. 
Yesterday, I met with members of 
the American College of Emergency 
Physicians, the people who work on the 
frontlines in our emergency depart-
ments and emergency rooms across the 
country—as well as the emergency 
nurses. One after another, they shared 
stories of the violence they see and ex-
perience. I can’t imagine walking into 
work every day knowing that this 
could be the day that someone was 
going to be struck or injured. 
A doctor talked about being stran-
gled with his stethoscope. A nurse 
talked about hearing a fellow nurse 
being punched and then falling on the 
floor, unconscious, and now with a con-
cussion. I met a nurse several years 
ago from Wisconsin who was beaten so 
severely by a patient that she can no 
longer work in nursing. 
We are not talking about studying a 
problem and coming up with a vol-
untary solution; we are talking about a 
crisis happening to our healthcare 
workers and at a time when they are 
also dealing with a pandemic. 
Healthcare workers, social service 
workers, nurses, and doctors have been 
here this week. We will have more 
coming next week. These frontline he-
roes, who have endured so much, de-
serve the protection of an enforceable 
OSHA standard, not just a voluntary 
program, which is already the status 
quo. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1081 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, as in leg-
islative session, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 1081 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration; further, that 
the Braun substitute amendment at 
the desk be considered and agreed to; 
that the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Ms. BALDWIN. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I sup-
pose I prematurely gave my reasons for 
objecting as I responded to Senator 
BRAUN’s objection to passing the Work-
place Violence Prevention for Health 
Care and Social Service Workers Act; 
but, again, this is pretty much the sta-
tus quo. If it is a voluntary program, it 
is not an enforceable OSHA standard; 
and these frontline heroes who have en-
dured so much over the past few years, 
with increases in violence and during 
the pandemic, deserve the legislation 
that I have sponsored, the Workplace 
Violence Prevention for Health Care 
and Social Service Workers Act. The 
House passed it over a year ago, and 
that is what we should be taking up. 
So I object.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2353 
May 5, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
NOMINATION OF KATHRYN HUFF 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to support the 
nomination that we are soon to vote 
on, and that is the nomination of Dr. 
Kathryn Huff. She was nominated to 
serve as the Assistant Secretary for 
Nuclear Energy at the Department of 
Energy. 
Now, while I don’t agree with her on 
many issues, she is a strong supporter 
of nuclear energy. She is well qualified 
for the position to which she has been 
nominated. She holds a Ph.D. in nu-
clear engineering and currently serves 
as a special adviser to the Energy Sec-
retary. 
Before joining the Department, Dr. 
Huff was an assistant professor in the 
Department of Nuclear, Plasma & Ra-
diological Engineering at the Univer-
sity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
She has also worked in our National 
Laboratories. 
At her nomination hearing in early 
March, Dr. Huff testified: 
It would be my honor to help the United 
States bolster and reclaim its global leader-
ship in nuclear energy. 
Now, more than ever, it is critical 
that the Department work diligently 
to 
make 
America 
energy-dominant 
again. Nuclear technology is essential 
to meeting America’s energy, environ-
mental, and national security objec-
tives. We need to be looking for oppor-
tunities to expand our use of nuclear 
energy. Dr. Huff is ready and able to 
take on that responsibility. 
Russia’s army is funded by the sale of 
energy. That includes uranium. Russia 
accounts for one-third of the world’s 
uranium conversion and half of the 
world’s uranium enrichment capacity. 
It is our third largest supplier of ura-
nium—for us in the United States. 
Russia’s brutal attack on Ukraine 
has opened the world’s eyes. We can’t 
be reliant on Russia. Now is the time 
for the United States to stop buying 
Russian uranium. Now is the time for 
the United States to ramp up our do-
mestic uranium production. Dr. Huff 
recognizes that opportunity, and she is 
prepared to act. 
The Department of Energy needs to 
take immediate action to establish a 
strategic uranium reserve. This is to 
ensure our existing reactors have the 
fuel that they need. 
We also can’t allow America’s ad-
vanced reactor developers to be de-
pendent on Russia. The Department of 
Energy needs to take immediate action 
to develop an American supply of high- 
assay, low-enriched uranium. To meet 
these challenges, we need experienced 
leadership in place at the Office of Nu-
clear Energy. Dr. Huff is up to that 
task. So I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting her nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MANCHIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 3 
minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KATHRYN HUFF 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, 2 days 
ago, it was my unhappy task to notify 
the Senate that the Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources had dead-
locked on another nomination and on 3 
important public land bills, with all 10 
Democratic members voting for each 
bill and all 10 Republican members vot-
ing against them. 
I strongly believe that the Senate 
works best when we work together, 
find common ground, and reach a con-
sensus and that we fail the American 
people when we don’t. 
So it is with great pleasure that I 
come to the floor today to speak on the 
nomination of Dr. Kathryn Huff to be 
the Assistant Secretary of Energy for 
Nuclear Energy. I am very pleased to 
say that Dr. Huff’s nomination is one 
thing Democrats and Republicans on 
the committee agree with completely. 
We reported her nomination last week 
without a single dissenting vote. I urge 
my colleagues, Democrats and Repub-
licans alike, to vote to confirm her 
today. 
My friend JOHN BARRASSO is ranking 
member, and we work very close to-
gether, and this is one that we found 
total unanimity that she is the right 
person at the right time in the right 
place for this job. 
Dr. Huff is extremely well qualified 
for this important position. She has 
the academic training as a physicist 
and in nuclear engineering. She holds 
degrees in physics from the University 
of Chicago and nuclear engineering 
from the University of Wisconsin-Madi-
son. She has extensive postgraduate ex-
perience as a research assistant at Ar-
gonne and the Idaho National Labora-
tories and as a postdoctoral fellow at 
Berkeley. She has extensive profes-
sional experience as a professor at the 
University of Illinois for 5 years before 
joining the Department of Energy. 
She joined the Department of Energy 
a year ago as the Principal Deputy As-
sistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy. 
She served as the Acting Assistant Sec-
retary for nearly a year prior to her 
nomination. She has very clearly dem-
onstrated her ability to handle the job 
through her performance as the Deputy 
and Acting Assistant Secretary over 
this past year. She also showed her 
firm grasp of nuclear issues facing the 
Department at her confirmation hear-
ing. 
In short, Dr. Huff has earned the 
strong bipartisan endorsement of the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. I urge all Senators to vote to 
confirm her today. It shows that when 
we get the right person who is qualified 
for the job, basically, we will come to-
gether. 
I would advise any administration to 
look deeply at the person you are 
bringing before us to make sure they 
fit those requirements. This is a carbon 
copy of what I would continue to find— 
people such as Dr. Huff to fill these 
very, very, very important jobs. It 
takes that type of dedication, but it 
takes the type of knowledge and expe-
rience that Dr. Huff has. 
I urge total adoption of this by all 
Members of our Senate, 100 of us. 
VOTE ON HUFF NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the 
Huff nomination? 
Mr. MANCHIN. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas 
and nays are requested. 
Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from Colorado (Mr. BENNET) is 
necessarily absent. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from South Carolina (Mr. GRAHAM), the 
Senator from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL), 
the Senator from Kansas (Mr. MORAN), 
the Senator from Ohio (Mr. PORTMAN), 
the Senator from Florida (Mr. RUBIO), 
the Senator from South Carolina (Mr.

SHELBY), and the Senator from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. TOOMEY). 
Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) 
would have voted ‘‘yea.’’

TRIBUTE TO ALISON KEAR 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, it 
is Thursday, and it is my favorite time 
of the week. And I can see the pages 
are getting all excited about another 
edition of the ‘‘Alaskan of the Week.’’ 
We get to talk about someone who is 
making a big difference in Alaska, 
someone whose spirit is helping others. 
We always like to end the week on a 
positive note here in the U.S. Senate, 
usually with an ‘‘Alaskan of the Week’’ 
speech. So before I get to talk about 
our special Alaskan, an incredible 
woman named Alison Kear, I am going 
to give a little update about what is 
going on in Alaska. 
So, as I mentioned last week, winter 
is no longer coming; winter is on the 
run. The sun is out longer and longer 
every day. Let me give you a real cool 
example. In Utqiagvik, known as Bar-
row—the northernmost city, commu-
nity, in North America at Point Bar-
row—the sun is getting out longer and 
longer each day. 
Now, remember, just 3 months ago, 
Utqiagvik had no sun—zero, zilch. 
Utqiagvik gained more than 17 minutes 
of daylight from yesterday. Isn’t that 
cool? It is kind of amazing. The sun 
rose at 4 a.m. and will set tonight after 
midnight. Four months ago there was 
no sun. So a lot going on. 
In Anchorage, the home of Alison, 
our Alaskan of the Week, it is in the 
50s, balmy this weekend. So it is a 
great time to be in Alaska. There isn’t 
a person who doesn’t long to visit the 
great State and join us up there. So 
please come and join us. 
So let me go back to Alison Kear, 
who is doing a great job in Alaska, our 
Alaskan of the Week. She runs a very 
special organization called Covenant 
House, one of 33 Covenant Houses in 
the United States, Canada, and Latin 
America. 
Covenant House’s mission is to help 
with youth homelessness. That means, 
of course, helping provide short- and 
long-term housing for young people 
who are experiencing homelessness. 
But to really help our young people— 
all people—get into a stable situation, 
whether that means to reunite with 
family or get into a permanent home, 
what Covenant House does involves so 
much more. 
At Covenant House Alaska, they 
offer so much more, and that has been 
Alison’s incredible legacy. So let me 
talk about Alison, who started with 
Covenant House in 1997. So she is cele-
brating 25 years with the organization, 
a silver anniversary. Way to go, Alison. 
We are so proud of her. 
She was born and raised in Florida. 
She went to college in Texas. She ar-
rived in Alaska in 1994 armed with a 
graduate degree in healthcare manage-
ment, a job at a local hospital in Alas-
ka, and big ideas about where her life 
would lead her. Initially, at least, 
those plans did not involve Covenant 
House. In fact, according to Alison, 
they didn’t involve Alaska for too long. 
She arrived—as she said recently to 
some of my team as we were putting 
this together—in the last frontier with 
big hair, a couple of fancy suits, and a 
plan: If she spent 3 years in Alaska

S2355 
May 5, 2022 
working at a hospital, she would prob-
ably get transferred to a big city of her 
choice in the lower 48 to run a hospital 
of her own. 
So that was the initial plan, Madam 
President. But like so many before her, 
her plans started to change. And like 
so many before her, the change of heart 
toward Alaska started making her 
think: Hmm, maybe I am going to stay 
here. Maybe I have a great life ahead of 
me in the great State of Alaska. 
Now, it happened a bit slowly. Alaska 
grew on her, as it does for so many peo-
ple. She moved into a house with a 
great group of people her age. She 
began to ski, enjoy the great outdoors, 
have fun, make friends, friends who 
eventually turned into her extended 
family. 
Slowly, Alison began to question 
that earlier plan she had that she was 
so committed to, and that started to 
lead to her thinking: I think I am 
going to have a great life here in Alas-
ka. Her best friend was the executive 
director of Covenant House Alaska. 
Then—25 years ago—it was a crisis 
shelter that offered few services and, to 
be honest, was struggling to actually 
stay open. 
Her friend asked Alison if she could 
volunteer a few hours of her time help-
ing with grant writing. So Alison said: 
Sure. I will do that, a little bit of time. 
And when her 3 years were up, that 
same friend said to her: You know, Ali-
son, I think you should stay. I think 
you need a mission right here at Cov-
enant House. 
Something about that rang true for 
Alison. So in 1997, she started work at 
Covenant House in development for $9 
an hour—with no health insurance, by 
the way. So she started kind of at the 
lower levels of Covenant House and 
started to work her way up. 
And then the mission that she never 
knew she needed found Alison. She 
tells a story about a Thanksgiving 
celebration they were having at Cov-
enant House. There was a boy sharing 
the meal with them, someone whose 
own story was filled with unspeakable 
trauma, even horror. He talked about 
his family: ‘‘I don’t think my mom 
ever loved me,’’ he told the group, ‘‘but 
I am glad that she had me because you 
guys here at Covenant House love me.’’ 
That is powerful. That is very power-
ful. That simple statement hit Alison. 
She 
called 
her 
mother, 
Mary 
Whittemore, that evening, crying to 
her mom. You always loved me, Alison 
told her mom. When she internalized 
that and realized how important that 
love is, the concept of who she was and 
what she could be changed forever. 
And I would say it changed Covenant 
House forever. Because of the love her 
mom gave her, she realized, too, that 
she had a big enough heart for love, es-
pecially at that wonderful organiza-
tion. And Alison has spread that love, 
that devotion and commitment to 
thousands of Alaska’s youth since that 
time, she and her team—her ‘‘rock 
stars,’’ as she calls them—at Covenant 
House. 
When she started—get this in terms 
of progress—Covenant House, as I men-
tioned, was a crisis shelter with a 
budget of about $900,000. Under Alison’s 
leadership and the hard work of so 
many others, it is now an organization 
with a budget of about $15 million, 
with a new job training center and 
more education and employment serv-
ices than ever before. 
Great job, Alison. 
And it has also become a nationwide 
model for helping youth. Through 
sheer tenacity, determination, and grit 
and 
through 
deep 
partnerships 
throughout the communities—not just 
in Anchorage but even beyond—Alison 
has led that effort. Roughly 200 kids a 
day from all over our State—thousands 
a year—are served by Covenant House 
Alaska. 
So how do they do it? Let’s say you 
are a teen. I know our pages can’t 
imagine being a teen. Let’s say you are 
a teen and you can’t stay at home any 
longer. Maybe there is abuse or family 
addiction or you have aged out of fos-
ter care, and you don’t have a place to 
sleep. 
Think 
about 
that. 
Unfortu-
nately, a lot of teens have that prob-
lem in America. 
And in Alaska, remember how cold it 
is—often below zero in the winter—and 
how horrible it is to sleep outside. So 
many of these kids are from rural parts 
of our State and have had to travel 
hundreds of miles to get to Anchorage. 
So now they are in the big city. They 
are likely to be traumatized, confused, 
lonely. It is bitterly cold outside. They 
have no place to go. 
These are children, and it is heart-
breaking whether you are in Alaska or 
anywhere else in the lower 48. So imag-
ine that. 
Now imagine this. Enter Covenant 
House Alaska. Covenant House has an 
outreach program, an incredible team 
of dedicated employees and servants to 
the people, to the kids, who walk the 
streets, go to malls, to homeless 
camps, wherever the kids might be. 
They give them some food, basic essen-
tials, and tell them about Covenant 
House. That is what Alison’s team 
does. They begin developing a relation-
ship of trust because most of these 
youth have actually never had a trust-
ing, stable adult in their lives. 
What do the youth find when they 
get to Covenant House? First, there are 
people who welcome them, who smile 
at them, who treat them with kind-
ness, who treat them with respect. If 
they are hungry, they get a warm 
meal, and they get shelter. And if they 
are dealing with trauma, they get 
counseling. 
Eventually, if they decide they need 
to finish school or earn their GED, 
there is a classroom there. If they are 
pregnant or already have a baby, they 
will learn positive parenting skills. 
Covenant 
House 
Alaska 
partners 
with several other amazing Alaskan or-
ganizations onsite—this is a big deal— 
what they call wraparound services, so 
the kids don’t need to go back on the 
streets. These different partners who 
work with Covenant House offer every-
thing a teen needs to learn about in 
terms of life skills that so many of us 
take for granted. 
And what is so amazing is that some-
one at Covenant House will stay with 
you for as long as you need it. They 
provide those services, even—this is 
really important—even after you leave 
the shelter, to help these teens navi-
gate the system, apply for jobs, get an 
apartment, 
get 
transportation, 
get 
them through a crisis that they might 
be having. 
All the things that we as parents do 
for our own kids, Covenant House does 
in so many ways for these kids—almost 
everything they might need to have a 
chance, an opportunity, a bright fu-
ture. 
Now, of course, Madam President, it 
is not that easy. It sounds easy, but it 
is not easy at all. Some of these youth 
have experienced unspeakable trauma. 
And I am going to talk a little bit 
about a tough subject, but it needs to 
be spoken about. For far too many of 
these youth, especially the young 
women and even some of the young 
men, they have been trafficked by bad 
people. 
And the statistics are horrific. A 2017 
study from Loyola University found 
that 28 percent of the young people 
being served at Covenant House Alaska 
identified themselves as survivors of 
human trafficking—28 percent. A dis-
proportionate number of these teen-
agers 
are 
Alaskan 
Native—young 
women, many of whom who have been 
lured out of their villages with a prom-
ise of a better life, and they have been 
lured into trafficking. 
At Covenant House, the leadership 
has not shied away from these statis-
tics, and I think that is a testament to 
Alison and her leadership. Instead, 
they talk openly about it. They have 
studied it. They work tirelessly and 
diligently with law enforcement and 
other agencies in Alaska to address 
this scourge, which, of course, we have 
in Alaska, and we have throughout 
America. 
Importantly, they make these sur-
vivors—and all the young people who 
come to Covenant House—feel safe. 
They call it ‘‘creating sanctuary’’ for 
the youth at Covenant House, and it 
works. It works. Alison said there are 
countless stories of young people who 
walked into Covenant House Alaska in 
crisis—traumatized, 
scared, 
lonely, 
very hurt—who are now happy high 
school and college graduates, working, 
with their own families, doing great 
things for the State. Some have even 
come back to be staff at Covenant 
House. I have had the honor of meeting 
a number of these young Alaskans who 
are contributing so much. 
Alison is the key reason why this has 
all happened successfully. She is tena-
cious. She is smart, stubborn—that is 
not my language, by the way; that was

her own language—ambitious and lov-
ing for her kids. Joe Hemphill, Cov-
enant House Alaska’s chief develop-
ment officer, calls Alison a ‘‘visionary 
for kids.’’ He has known her for 25 
years, and Joe said this about Alison: 
One thing . . . hasn’t changed [in over 25 
years]: she has never taken ‘‘no’’ for an an-
swer and she still doesn’t. 
But her heart leads. When you talk 
to her, she will tell you that love is 
truly the answer for all that ails our 
communities and certainly for all that 
ails our young people in them. 
‘‘How great it is to create a space 
where someone can . . . feel love,’’ Ali-
son said, ‘‘to take it and to give it.’’ 
She continued: 
It’s the only thing that has truly changed 
communities [when you think about it]. 
Homelessness is not a singular experience. 
It’s about a void in relationships, it’s about 
a void of love. 
Again, Alison credits her mother— 
that is very sweet, especially as we are 
approaching Mother’s Day—for helping 
her understand what love means and 
how she can give it to others and how 
it can make a huge difference in all of 
our communities. 
So I want to thank all the staff at 
Covenant House Alaska for doing such 
great work, day in, day out, 24/7, 365 
days a year. As I mentioned, I want to 
thank you. My wife Julie also wants to 
thank you. Julie has had the honor of 
working at Covenant House for several 
years as staff and on the board and she 
has seen firsthand all the great work 
that Alison and her team have done for 
our youth in Alaska. 
Again, to all of Covenant House, 
thank you for walking alongside our 
youth who have not had love in their 
lives and yet who are resilient and 
working hard to find a positive path in 
life. The Covenant House team is mak-
ing that happen. 
And, of course, thank you to Alison 
for leading this exceptional team. By 
the way, Alison, I know your birthday 
is coming up, so happy birthday. And 
most importantly, thank you, again, 
for being our Alaskan of the Week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon is recognized. 
REMEMBERING ORRIN G. HATCH 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
come to the Senate floor today to 
speak about Senator Orrin Hatch, and I 
think it is very fitting that the distin-
guished Senator from Nevada be in the 
chair because she has been doing very 
good work on the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. And as she knows, Senator 
Hatch was my partner in leading the 
Senate Finance Committee for 5 years. 
The Senate greatly mourns his pass-
ing, and I am going to take a few min-
utes to reflect on the important work 
he did serving the people of Utah and 
all Americans, particularly with re-
spect to the Finance Committee. 
It is no secret that Senator Hatch 
and I did not always agree 100 percent 
of the time. We had differences on 
taxes. We had differences on asylum 
and immigration. We had differences 
on the environment. One thing that the 
two of us did agree on was the value of 
showing up every day and searching for 
bipartisanship and for common ground. 
And we were able to do that, some-
times defying the odds on the Senate 
Finance Committee, and I am going to 
briefly recount some of those accom-
plishments in honor of his memory. 
First, the landmark reauthorization of 
the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram, for a decade, the longest ever 
commitment to children’s health since 
the program was created. 
And by the way, Senator Hatch was 
the coauthor of the original bill with 
his Democratic partner, the late Ted 
Kennedy. What a success CHIP has 
been shown to be. A wonderful State- 
Federal partnership. More than 9 mil-
lion 
kids 
have 
affordable, 
quality 
healthcare thanks to CHIP. Within 2 
years of becoming law, 47 States have 
set up a CHIP program, and today 
every State participates in CHIP. 
As my friend from Nevada knows, 
sometimes it is hard to get the States 
to agree on whether you might buy a 
7Up, all the States, but the CHIP pro-
gram is a huge effort, and what a re-
markable accomplishment, led by Sen-
ator Hatch, in keeping kids covered 
and healthy. In fact, just 5 years after 
the program was enacted, CHIP re-
duced the uninsurance rate for children 
by half. 
Now, the road to a 10-year reauthor-
ization was not exactly smooth. In 
fact, the authorization actually expired 
for nearly 4 months, but despite the 
setbacks and, as I say, taking on long 
odds, Chairman Hatch and I just kept 
at it, focusing on the impact that this 
historic legislation would have on the 
reason we all do public service, which 
is to make people’s lives better. And it 
was clear that this was a real oppor-
tunity to make a lasting investment in 
the well-being of kids, and we were 
committed to doing that together. 
So, now, thanks to the leadership of 
Chairman Hatch, the healthcare for 
millions of America’s kids is secure 
until 2027. And I know because I re-
member looking over just a few desks 
away to Chairman Hatch and won-
dering if we were going to be able to 
keep this effort bipartisan, if we were 
going to actually get it done. He would 
smile, and he would look over at me in 
that kind of way, just sort of ‘‘Stick 
with me, colleague,’’ because he so 
often treated me almost like a son. 
And it always made me feel that there 
was a chance, as I said, to show people 
that even in a very polarized and divi-
sive time, we could get something real-
ly important accomplished like stand-
ing up for kids. 
Now, the next item that I want to 
mention 
involves 
transforming 
the 
Medicare Program. As my friend from 
Nevada knows, my roots are with the 
Grey Panthers, a senior citizens group. 
When I was coming up, Medicare was a 
program for acute illness—if you broke 
your ankle, if you had a horrible case 
of the flu, you went to a hospital, you 
saw your doctor—not Medicare today 
in Nevada and Oregon. 
Today, Medicare is about chronic ill-
ness: cancer, diabetes, heart disease, 
strokes, COPD. That is overwhelmingly 
the Medicare Program today. 
And when I briefly was chairman of 
the Finance Committee, I held the first 
hearing on updating Medicare to place 
the focus squarely on updating what we 
always have called the Medicare guar-
antee. Medicare isn’t a slip of paper; it 
is a guarantee. And Chairman Hatch 
graciously agreed to continue that ef-
fort. 
It began when I was the chair. And it 
took the better part of 2 years and a 
lot of guts for Chairman Hatch to take 
that on because the rule—the rule at 
that time—was you didn’t even bring 
up fundamental Medicare reform be-
cause everybody went to opposite sides, 
and that was the end of the discussion. 
Chairman Hatch said: Not on my 
watch. We are going to do something 
very different. 
And there were groundbreaking de-
velopments in that chronic care bill 
that make a difference today for Amer-
icans. Throughout the pandemic, it was 
clear that we needed to make bold re-
forms to increase the role and oppor-
tunity for telehealth to serve our peo-
ple. 
All our colleagues would come back 
from a visit home, do something about 
telehealth. Well, what happened was 
that the Center for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services was trying to move 
quickly, and they were looking for a 
model. And I remember then-Secretary 
of Medicare and Medicaid Services 
Seema Verma called me up and said es-
sentially: Would you mind if we used 
the model for expanding telehealth 
which Chairman Hatch and you led in 
the Finance Committee? 
And we said: We are thrilled, all in, 
let’s go. 
And today that model continues to 
expand. As my colleague from Nevada 
knows, in the recent major budget bill, 
we expanded it to audio only because 
we had so many rural communities 
where they didn’t have broadband, 
where there was a big senior popu-
lation, and they wanted to expand tele-
health. None of that was possible un-
less Chairman Hatch was willing to 
take on a big Medicare reform under-
taking, updating the guarantee, recog-
nizing that in the 21st century it 
wasn’t like Medicare when it began, 
and it really is going to make a big, big 
difference. 
And as I say, we are going to keep ex-
panding 
telehealth. 
My 
colleague 
knows we are looking to have a major 
mental health reform effort in this ses-
sion. A big part of it will be expanding 
telehealth in covering mental health 
services. Chairman Hatch did so much 
to make that debate possible. 
Finally, a third area—and this was 
all in one Congress, three major bills— 
and I could take kind of another prism 
and talk about the chairman, but we

S2357 
May 5, 2022 
passed the Family First Prevention 
Services Act. What an incredibly im-
portant task that was. 
We saw with foster care families, 
there was a challenge in getting the 
care that people needed in those facili-
ties, and we saw that many families 
who weren’t in the foster care system 
were trying to make decisions about 
how to do what was best for their fam-
ily. Maybe a loved one, a parent of a 
child had had some drug challenges, an 
alcohol challenge, and the choice at 
that time—Madam President, I think 
you will recall this—was essentially 
two options: One, keep the child in a 
family situation that was far from de-
sirable or, two, send the child off to a 
foster care facility that left something 
to be desired, some good foster care, 
some not so good. 
Chairman Hatch led the effort to a 
third path, Family First, so that now 
when you have families, there might be 
an older relative, a grandparent, it is 
called Kinship Care. The grandparent 
can step in and help the family as a 
parent might be dealing with that alco-
hol challenge. 
And States all over this country now 
are moving to use Family First. They 
are moving to make it possible for a 
grandparent to step in as a caretaker 
for grandkids. 
Building flexibility into the system, 
as my friend from Nevada and I have 
often talked about, that is not a Demo-
cratic or a Republican issue, that is 
just common sense. And often—often— 
Chairman Hatch would say: What is 
just a commonsense approach here? 
I am going to talk for the remainder 
of my time about what a pleasure it 
was to be with Senator Hatch, person-
ally. 
We met almost every week, alter-
nating between our offices. He would 
tell stories. He wore a mezuzah with 
great pride because he so valued his 
friendship with the Jewish people. 
He told wonderful stories about his 
childhood in Pittsburgh, saving up 
money to take the trolley to the sym-
phony, and fascinating stories about 
his friendship with Muhammad Ali, 
which almost invariably led to putting 
his fists in the air and showing me a 
little bit about the shadowboxing that 
he did with his wonderful friend, Mu-
hammad Ali. 
And then, of course, you would al-
ways hear about his side career as a 
platinum-record-selling musician and 
composer. And, finally, he was so good 
to his friends; he almost invariably in-
flated their accomplishments to those 
he was with, such as he did for years 
with me about basketball. 
He loved talking about books, espe-
cially history books. I gave him books 
that my father had written; he read 
them closely. He would often bring big 
books to the floor of the Senate on a 
late night. And I see so many of our 
wonderful staff who can probably pic-
ture Chairman Hatch sitting right 
there—and I see the nods—with a big 
book, reading, and that was a special 
moment as he made his way through a 
thick history volume and then told us 
a little bit about it. 
What an accomplished Senator. What 
a good man. Nancy and I send our con-
dolences to Elaine, to their children, to 
the many staffers who worked with 
Chairman Hatch over the years. And I 
want to close this way because this is 
how Chairman Hatch often closed a 
meeting. We would meet in each oth-
er’s offices every week. 
And I remember, often he would 
stand up at the end of the meeting, giv-
ing me one of those inimitable Orrin 
Hatch smiles, and he would look at me 
and he would go: ‘‘So long, friend.’’ 
That was Orrin Hatch today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

WARNOCK). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING 
P31 
THERAPEUTIC 
GRADE 
ESSENTIAL 
OILS 
AND 
HOMEMADE PRODUCTS 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week, I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, P31 Thera-
peutic Grade Essential Oils and Home-
made Products of Morgantown, KY, as 
the Senate Small Business of the Week. 
As any small business owner knows, 
the path of entrepreneurship is rarely 
straight and narrow. As is the case 
with this small business owner, Tabby 
Daugherty, who opened P31 Thera-
peutic Grade Essential Oils and Home-
made Products, also known as P31 
Storefront Insiders, in 2018. P31’s story 
began a couple years prior to her offi-
cial opening date. In 2016, Tabby was a 
part-time 
employee 
at 
Life-Skills, 
working with adults with disabilities 
while she raised her several children. 
As a mother of a large family, she 
strived to keep the meaning of Prov-
erbs 31 at the core of her work and 
home life. What served as a motto of 
sorts became the inspiration for her 
business and its name, hence the P31. 
Proverbs 31:17–18 reads, ‘‘She dresses 
herself with strength and makes her 
arms strong. She perceives that her 
merchandise is profitable. Her lamp 
does not go out at night.’’ Taking from 
that verse, Tabby sought to make her-
self and her household more self-sus-
taining and started to make her own 
laundry soap. Word gathered around 
town, and soon, there was widespread 
interest in Tabby’s homemade soap. 
This do-it-yourself project and the de-
mand it garnered soon led to her found-
ing her own business. 
A business selling soap grew into a 
venture that offered over 100 products. 
After a friend suggested she start cre-
ating products using essential oils, 
Tabby expanded her variety of products 
and began to sell moisturizers, serums, 
bracelets, and diffusers. She also cre-
ates custom products used to treat 
maladies. Around town, people know 
Tabby as a giver, evident in her role as 
a mother of a big family and in her pre-
vious job at Life-Skills looking after 
those with disabilities. For that rea-
son, many put their faith in her and 
her products, often coming to her with 
a special request for a specific blend. 
Tabby gladly takes all requests even 
though it requires extra time and care

on her part to learn how to create 
these specially-requested items. 
Customers keep coming back to P31 
Storefront Insiders because they appre-
ciate the diligent care Tabby takes in 
creating her line of items. The citizens 
of Morgantown and beyond seek her 
out because they know that all her 
products are made with real ingredi-
ents, are made in store, and are created 
without fragrances or synthetic prod-
ucts. Moreover, Tabby and her business 
operations abide by a strict set of 
codes, the most fundamental of which 
is customer appreciation. Patrons walk 
in to feel welcomed and lifted up. 
Tabby keeps the essence of her favorite 
proverb at the core of her life and her 
shop, evident for all to see. 
Tabby is a strong force within the 
Morgantown community. She stays in-
volved with the local chapter of the 
Boys and Girls Club, as well as the 
local bass fishing team. She also makes 
sure her business is there to fill any 
sort of community need that may 
arise, for example, in previous clothes 
drives she has offered P31 Storefront 
Insiders as a drop-off location. And 
when her children’s sports team needed 
to raise money for new equipment, she 
took a creative approach towards lend-
ing a hand: providing the ingredients of 
her famous soap to the team’s players, 
requiring them to make it and sell it 
on their own. In this way, she provided 
the team the tools to achieve their 
fundraising goals but allowed the chil-
dren to take responsibility for their ef-
forts. Given its popularity, she has also 
opened that opportunity to other But-
ler County schools. 
A giving and charitable spirit per-
meates throughout Tabby’s life and her 
business. 
She 
currently 
offers 
a 
‘‘Maggie Collection’’ product line of 
bracelets. Maggie is a local young girl 
who was diagnosed with leukemia, and 
P31 donates $2 from every bracelet sold 
towards Maggie’s treatment. Tabby 
also hosts an in-store bible study every 
Wednesday for local teenage girls, al-
lowing them the opportunity to speak 
about devotion over pizza and soda. 
Without a doubt, Tabby is a force for 
good, and she capitalizes on her posi-
tion as a local entrepreneur to help im-
prove the lives of those around her. She 
truly captures the benevolent essence 
that so often goes hand in hand with 
the entrepreneurial spirit. I want to 
congratulate the whole team at P31 
Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils and 
Homemade Products and wish Tabby 
the best of luck. I look forward to 
watching her continued growth and 
success in Kentucky.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. REED: 
S. 4148. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Energy to complete and pub-
lish a study and develop a plan relating 
to the ability of the electric system to 
meet the electricity demand of new 
electric vehicle charging infrastruc-
ture, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
introducing the Electric Vehicle Grid, 
Improvement, and Development Act, 
which would take important steps to 
prepare our electric grid for the de-
ployment of the electric vehicle charg-
ing infrastructure that is essential to 
meeting our climate goals. 
Our Nation’s dependence on fossil 
fuels has created serious challenges for 
our security, economy, and environ-
ment. The electrification of our trans-
portation system will play a crucial 
role in confronting those challenges. 
Indeed, electric vehicles will help re-
duce our dependence on oil, lower car-
bon emissions and save Americans 
money at the pump. 
The bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act took great strides 
in advancing the deployment of elec-
tric vehicles. The bill provided $15 bil-
lion for electric vehicles, including $7.5 
billion to create a national network of 
electric vehicle charging stations. Of 
these funds, Rhode Island should re-
ceive $23 million for the deployment of 
new charging stations across the State. 
Investments 
in 
electric 
vehicle 
charging infrastructure must be paired 
with grid readiness measures to ensure 
we can decarbonize as quickly as pos-
sible. To that end, the EV GRID Act 
would direct the Department of Energy 
to complete a study on the anticipated 
demand of electric vehicle charging in-
frastructure on our electric grid. It 
would also direct the Department, once 
the study is completed, to submit a 
plan with recommendations for policy-
makers to help the electric system 
meet demand. 
This bill is critical to ensuring a 
smooth transition toward a cleaner, 
decarbonized transportation sector. I 
urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this commonsense legislation. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and 
Mr. BROWN): 
S. 4155. A bill to amend title 28, 
United 
States 
Code, 
to 
authorize 
extraterritorial jurisdiction; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4155 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Alien Tort 
Statute Clarification Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Since its founding, the United States 
has been a proponent of international law 
and a champion of universal human rights. 
Section 1350 of title 28, United States Code 
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘Alien 
Tort Statute’’), originally enacted as part of 
the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to establish the ju-
dicial courts of the United States’’, approved 
September 24, 1789 (1 Stat. 73), continues to 
serve important purposes in providing rem-
edies to victims of violations of inter-
national law and for holding perpetrators of 
human rights violations accountable. 
(2) Some international law violations have 
been addressed in part by other statutes. But 
the Alien Tort Statute remains an important 
tool for addressing international law viola-
tions. 
(3) Human rights abusers continue to seek 
refuge in the United States, including for-
eign government and military officials and 
leaders of death squads and other violent 
groups. This undermines the standing of the 
United States and its capacity to speak with 
authority on matters of human rights. 
(4) When corporations commit or aid and 
abet human rights violations directly and 
through their supply chains, they should be 
held accountable. Failing to do so erodes the 
foreign policy interests of the United States 
and the priorities of Congress. 
(5) Impunity for corporations who violate 
human rights unfairly disadvantages busi-
nesses that respect and uphold human rights. 
Companies that respect human rights should 
have a level playing field with companies 
that do not, such as those that would con-
tinue to do business in areas of the world 
known for mass atrocities or war crimes, in-
cluding the Xinjiang region of the People’s 
Republic of China or in the Russian Federa-
tion amidst the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. 
(6) In many countries where human rights 
abuses occur, victims are unable to obtain 
justice because of ongoing conflicts and vio-
lence, corruption, and inadequate rule of 
law. In many such cases, a suit under the 
Alien Tort Statute is the only option for re-
dress and accountability. 
(7) The international law violations for 
which the Alien Tort Statute provides a rem-
edy are universal and the Alien Tort Statute 
is a testament to the rule of law in the 
United States. 
(8) The Alien Tort Statute should be avail-
able against those responsible for human 
rights abuses whenever they are subject to 
personal jurisdiction in the United States, 
regardless of where the abuse occurred. 
SEC. 3. EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION. 
Section 1350 of title 28, United State Code, 
is amended— 
(1) by inserting ‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—’’ before 
‘‘The district’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(b) EXTRATERRITORIAL
JURISDICTION.—In 
addition to any domestic or extraterritorial 
jurisdiction otherwise provided by law, the 
district courts of the United States have 
extraterritorial jurisdiction over any tort 
described in subsection (a) if— 
‘‘(1) an alleged defendant is a national of 
the United States or an alien lawfully admit-
ted for permanent residence (as those terms 
are defined in section 101 of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101)); or 
‘‘(2) an alleged defendant is present in the 
United States, irrespective of the nationality 
of the alleged defendant.’’. 
By Mr. PADILLA: 
S. 4158. A bill to amend the small 
business laws to create certain require-
ments with respect to the SBIR and 
STTR program, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the ‘‘Encour-
aging Small Business Innovation Act,’’ 
which I introduced today. 
During 
National 
Small 
Business 
Week, we are celebrating the resiliency 
of our Nation’s entrepreneurs who are 
leading our economic recovery from 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
To promote a strong recovery for the 
32.5 million small businesses across the 
country, Congress should bolster Fed-
eral programs that support these entre-
preneurs and innovators. 
For more than 40 years, the Small 
Business 
Innovation 
Research 
and 
Small Business Technology Transfer 
Programs have spurred innovation, job 
creation, and economic growth. 
These 
programs 
have 
generated 
breakthroughs in a wide range of sec-
tors, including agriculture, defense, en-
ergy, healthcare, and transportation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2361 
May 5, 2022 
Today, the Small Business Adminis-
tration and 11 participating Federal 
Agencies leverage the SBIR and STTR 
Programs to help small innovative 
firms explore their potential and in-
crease the commercialization of inno-
vations arising out of Federal research 
and development. 
While these critical programs have 
invested more than $40 billion in small 
businesses, 
many 
firms, 
especially 
those that are minority- or women- 
owned, still face considerable barriers 
to participation. 
As we look to spur innovation and 
drive small business growth, Congress 
should improve the diversity of these 
programs, enhance access to capital, 
and expand the eligible uses of funds to 
better support the needs of U.S. small 
businesses. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill to increase the effectiveness of 
the SBIR and STTR Programs by im-
proving diversity, enhancing access to 
capital, and expanding the eligible uses 
of funds. 
This bill would direct participating 
Federal Agencies to use a portion of 
their SBIR allocation to conduct out-
reach and provide technical assistance 
to underserved populations and states. 
It would also allow Small Business 
Investment Companies to participate 
as 
investors 
in 
SBIR 
and 
STTR 
projects and permanently add testing 
and evaluation activities permanently 
as an eligible expense, which can be re-
source-intensive for small firms, across 
all relevant agencies. 
Additionally, this bill would require 
participating Federal Agencies to con-
duct a joint annual meeting to share 
best practices for improving data col-
lection 
and 
streamlining 
processes 
across the programs. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill to improve the ef-
fectiveness of the SBIR and STTR Pro-
grams.

submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 616 
Whereas the 10 members of the Association 
of South East Asian Nations (‘‘ASEAN’’) rep-
resent a variety of different cultures and be-
liefs; 
Whereas an estimated 7,000,000 United 
States citizens identify with an ethnicity 
represented in ASEAN; 
Whereas the United States and ASEAN 
have been cooperating to advance mutual in-
terests for approximately 45 years, having 
first established dialogue on September 10, 
1977, through the Joint Communique of the 
First ASEAN-United States Dialogue and 
the United States acceded to the Treaty of 
Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia at 
the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference Ses-
sion in Thailand on July 22, 2009; 
Whereas the United States was the first 
non-ASEAN country to appoint an ambas-
sador to ASEAN on April 29, 2008, and the 
first non-member to establish a permanent 
mission to ASEAN in 2010; 
Whereas cooperation between the United 
States Government and the governments and 
people of ASEAN member states can help re-
alize the common goals of a free, open, 
peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region 
rooted in a rules-based order that promotes 
security, opportunity, and dignity to all peo-
ple; 
Whereas ASEAN member states have vi-
brant economies that have given rise to a 
flourishing middle class and collectively are 
predicted to become the fourth-largest econ-
omy in the world by 2050;

BRATING YOUNG AMERICANS’’ 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
CRAPO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 618 
Whereas, each year in the United States, 
El Dı´a de los Nin˜ os–Celebrating Young 
Americans is recognized as a day to affirm 
and recognize the importance of young chil-
dren and adolescents in the United States; 
Whereas children and adolescents rep-
resent the hopes and dreams of the people of 
the United States, and the well-being of chil-
dren and adolescents is emphasized as a top 
priority in the United States; 
Whereas, according to data of the Bureau 
of the Census, the Hispanic population in the 
United States is the youngest major racial 
or ethnic group in the United States, as— 
(1) more than 18,600,000 Hispanics in the 
United States, a group that represents ap-
proximately 1⁄3 of the Hispanic population in 
the United States, are younger than 18 years 
of age; and 
(2) in 2019, nearly 16,400,000 Hispanics in the 
United States, a group that represents more 
than 1⁄4 of the Hispanic population in the 
United States, were individuals between 18 
and 34 years of age; 
Whereas the Hispanic population in the 
United States continues to grow and is a sig-
nificant part of the workforce in the United 
States, and children in that population will 
be consumers, taxpayers, and voters in the 
future; 
Whereas, as the United States becomes 
more culturally and ethnically diverse, the 
people of the United States must strive to 
bring about cultural understanding and cele-
brate a tradition that honors all children 
and adolescents on El Dı´a de los Nin˜ os–Cele-
brating Young Americans, a day that ac-
knowledges and shares traditions and cus-
toms with all people in the United States; 
Whereas parents are at the center of teach-
ing children about family values, morality, 
life preparation, health, survival, and cul-
ture; 
Whereas the designation of a day of special 
recognition to honor children and adoles-
cents in the United States— 
(1) will help affirm the significance of fam-
ily, 
education, 
health, 
and 
community 
among the people of the United States; and 
(2) will provide an opportunity for those 
children and adolescents to reflect on their 
futures, to articulate their aspirations, to 
find comfort and security in the support of 
their family members, communities, and 
schools, and to grow to contribute to the 
United States; 
Whereas the National Latino Children’s In-
stitute, which served as an advocate and a 
voice for young Latino children, partnered 
with States and cities throughout the United 
States beginning in 1998 to highlight the con-
tributions and challenges of young Latino 
children by advocating for the success and 
well-being of such children; and 
Whereas April 30, 2022, would be an appro-
priate day to recognize as ‘‘El Dı´a de los 
Nin˜ os–Celebrating Young Americans’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes April 30, 2022, as ‘‘El Dı´a de 
los Nin˜ os–Celebrating Young Americans’’; 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States— 
(A) to nurture and invest in children and 
adolescents in order to preserve and enhance 
economic prosperity, democracy, and the 
free and open exchange of ideas, which are 
concepts that are essential to the spirit of 
the United States; and 
(B) to celebrate the gifts of children and 
adolescents and to help them take their 
rightful place in the future of the United 
States; and 
(3) calls on the people of the United States 
to join with children, families, communities, 
schools, churches, cities, and States across 
the United States to observe El Dı´a de los 
Nin˜ os–Celebrating Young Americans with 
appropriate ceremonies, including activities 
that— 
(A) center on children and are free or of 
minimal cost so as to facilitate full partici-
pation by all people; 
(B) uplift and help children positively envi-
sion a path to their futures by allowing chil-
dren to voice their hopes and dreams; 
(C) offer opportunities for children of di-
verse backgrounds to learn about the cul-
tures of one another and to share ideas; 
(D) include family members, especially ex-
tended and elderly family members, so as 
to— 
(i) promote understanding and communica-
tion among generations within families; and 
(ii) enable young people to learn from, and 
respect and benefit from the experiences of, 
their family elders; 
(E) enable diverse communities to build re-
lationships of understanding; and 
(F) provide children with safe schools, 
homes, and communities that give them the 
long-term support they need to learn, de-
velop, and become confident young adults

their expertise and innovative ideas; and

ance of public servants during the COVID–19

functioning of Congress and the safety and 
security of Members of Congress, their staffs, 
and visitors to the Capitol complex;

SENATE RESOLUTION 620—DESIG-
NATING MAY 5, 2022, AS THE 
‘‘NATIONAL DAY OF AWARENESS 
FOR MISSING AND MURDERED 
NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS’’ 
Mr. 
DAINES 
(for 
himself,

TESTER, Mr. HOEVEN, Mr. MORAN, Mr. 
SCHATZ, Ms. SMITH, Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, 
Mr. 
LUJA´ N, 
Ms. 
MURKOWSKI, 
Mr. 
CRAMER, Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. WYDEN, 
Mr. ROUNDS, Ms. HIRONO, and Mr. 
GRASSLEY) submitted the following res-
olution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 620 
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Na-
tives are 2.5 times more likely to experience 
violent crimes and at least 2 times more 
likely to experience rape or sexual assault 
crimes compared to any other group of peo-
ple in the United States; 
Whereas, according to a study commis-
sioned by the Department of Justice, in some 
Tribal 
communities, 
American 
Indian 
women face murder rates that are more than 
10 times the national average murder rate; 
Whereas, according to the most recently 
available data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, in 2017, homicide 
was the sixth leading cause of death for 
American Indian and Alaska Native females 
between 1 and 44 years of age; 
Whereas the Hawaii State Commission on 
the Status of Women released reports finding 
that 64 percent of trafficking survivors in 
Hawaii identified as being Native Hawaiian; 
Whereas little data exists on the number of 
missing American Indian, Alaska Native, 
and Native Hawaiian women in the United 
States; 
Whereas, on July 5, 2013, Hanna Harris, a 
member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, 
was reported missing by her family in Lame 
Deer, Montana; 
Whereas the body of Hanna Harris was 
found 5 days after she went missing; 
Whereas Hanna Harris was determined to 
have been raped and murdered, and the indi-
viduals accused of committing those crimes 
were convicted; 
Whereas the case of Hanna Harris is an ex-
ample of many similar cases; and 
Whereas Hanna Harris was born on May 5, 
1992: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 5, 2022, as the ‘‘National 
Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered 
Native Women and Girls’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
and interested groups— 
(A) to commemorate the lives of missing 
and murdered American Indian, Alaska Na-
tive, and Native Hawaiian women whose 
cases are documented and undocumented in 
public records and the media; and 
(B) to demonstrate solidarity with the 
families of victims in light of those trage-
dies. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
on February 3 of this year, at 4 in the 
morning, outside of Reno, callers told 
police that there was a car on fire on 
the shoulder of the interstate. Inside, 
officers found the body of a 23-year-old 
woman named Anna Marie Scott. She 
had been murdered by an unknown as-
sailant. 
This is Anna—as you can see, a beau-
tiful, beautiful young girl. She was a 
beloved daughter and a sister and a de-
voted mother of two young children. 
She was also a member of the Pyramid 
Lake Paiute Tribe. And she joins a 
long and tragic list of Native women 
who have gone missing or been mur-
dered, 
leaving 
families 
desperately 
waiting for answers. 
Families like Anna’s will tell you one 
of the worst things about a tragedy 
like this is that they never had a 
chance to say goodbye to their loved 
one. Another is knowing that decade 
after decade, the United States has not 
done enough to protect Native women, 
leaving families all over Indian Coun-
try searching for answers. 
A National Institutes of Justice 
study found that an unbelievable 84 
percent of Native women experience vi-
olence in their lifetimes, along with 81 
percent of men. It also reported that 
Native women are almost twice as like-
ly as White women to have been the 
target of violence in the past year. 
These numbers confirm what Native 
communities have known for years: 
Native people are vulnerable, and they 
can be taken from their families at any 
time. 
In 2020, I secured passage of two bi-
partisan bills with Senator MURKOWSKI, 
who we all know is a tireless advocate 
for Native communities, to finally cre-
ate a national strategy to address the 
crisis of missing, murdered, and traf-
ficked Indigenous women and girls. The 
Not Invisible Act instructs the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs to coordinate Federal 
efforts to address the epidemic of vio-
lence in Native American commu-
nities. 
It also mandates a commission made 
up of Tribal, State, and local law en-
forcement, 
service 
providers, 
rep-
resentatives of Federal Agencies, Trib-
al leaders, and survivors and family 
members. 
The other piece of legislation, Savan-
na’s Act, which we passed, requires the 
creation of guidelines for law enforce-
ment on how best to keep Native 
women safe, and it improves reporting 
of violent crimes against Native people 
and strengthens vital access to Federal 
crime databases. 
These two laws create powerful tools 
that will help curb violence against Na-
tive people. But they cannot fulfill 
that mission if they are not imple-
mented by the executive branch. And 
to date, the administration has missed 
too many deadlines mandated by stat-
ute for putting the legislation into ef-
fect. That is why this week, I sent a 
letter, with Senators TESTER and MUR-
KOWSKI, to the administration urging 
them to implement key provisions of 
our bipartisan bills. 
Now, I am thrilled to share that, 
today, Secretary Haaland announced 
the members of the Not Invisible Com-
mission, which now can begin its work. 
This is excellent news, and I appreciate 
this and other important steps the ad-
ministration has taken to address the 
problem. 
But there is still more we need to be 
doing to implement the policies Con-
gress has passed that will make a dif-
ference on the ground for so many fam-
ilies. That includes issuing Federal

guidelines to help local law enforce-
ment with best practices to protect Na-
tive communities and implementing 
the data collection needed to address 
the crisis. The work must continue be-
cause families continue to wait. 
Just as I call on this administration 
to do more, I am committed to doing 
more myself. My office is working to 
reintroduce legislation that I cospon-
sored with Senators UDALL, TESTER, 
and MURKOWSKI last Congress to im-
prove coordination and data-sharing 
between Tribal and Federal law en-
forcement. 
My congressional colleagues and I 
have, this year, once again introduced 
a resolution recognizing May 5 as a day 
of awareness for the crisis of missing 
and murdered Native women and girls. 
But let’s be clear: A day of awareness 
is for those who don’t know about the 
problem. Indigenous families in Nevada 
and across the country are only too 
conscious of the risks their sisters, 
brothers, cousins, and children face. 
And they are looking to Congress and 
to this administration for concrete 
progress in the long way for justice. 
I will keep fighting for that justice 
and for Anna. But I am here to say to 
our Congress and administration, let’s 
not have any more Annas. Let’s do the 
right thing for these families and indi-
viduals.

submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 621 
Whereas the Honorable Orrin G. Hatch was 
elected to the Senate in 1976 and served Utah 
in the Senate with devotion and distinction 
for 42 years, which is the ninth longest term 
of service in the history of the Senate; 
Whereas Orrin G. Hatch served as the 
Chairman of 3 significant Senate commit-
tees, including— 
(1) the Committee on Labor and Human 
Resources of the Senate (now called the 
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions of the Senate); 
(2) the Committee on the Judiciary of the 
Senate; and 
(3) the Committee on Finance of the Sen-
ate; 
Whereas Orrin G. Hatch dedicated his time 
in the Senate to strengthening the economy 
of the United States, protecting individual 
liberty, and safeguarding the system of lim-
ited government of the United States; 
Whereas Orrin G. Hatch served throughout 
his career with determination, loyalty, dili-
gence, compassion, a pioneering spirit, and 
an incredible devotion to his faith; 
Whereas Orrin G. Hatch was regarded by 
many as an elder statesman who worked 
across the aisle to pass 750 bills into law, in-
cluding— 
(1) the Religious Freedom Restoration Act 
of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.); 
(2) the Drug Price Competition and Patent 
Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98– 
417; 98 Stat. 1585) (commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘Hatch-Waxman Act’’); 
(3) the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public 
Law 105–33; 111 Stat. 215), which established

gram under title XXI of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.); 
(4) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.); and 
(5) the Radiation Exposure Compensation 
Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 note); 
Whereas Orrin G. Hatch, in addition to his 
prolific legislative achievements, assisted 
tens of thousands of Utahns through indi-
vidual casework over more than four decades 
of public service; 
Whereas Orrin G. Hatch established the 
Orrin G. Hatch Foundation to encourage 
commonsense policymaking, to cultivate bi-
partisan dialogue, and to provide educational 
opportunities for future generations; and 
Whereas, on April 23, 2022, at the age of 88, 
Orrin G. Hatch died, leaving behind his wife 
Elaine, his 6 loving children, dozens of grand-
children and great-grandchildren, and a leg-
acy of steadfast love for and service to the 
people of the United States, particularly 
Utahns: Now, therefore, be it

(A) has heard with profound sorrow and 
deep regret the announcement of the death 
of the Honorable Orrin G. Hatch, former 
United States Senator for the State of Utah;

SENATE RESOLUTION 622—RECOG-
NIZING THE CULTURAL AND HIS-
TORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
CINCO DE MAYO HOLIDAY 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
CORNYN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 622 
Whereas May 5, or ‘‘Cinco de Mayo’’ in 
Spanish, is celebrated each year as a date of 
importance by Mexican and Mexican-Amer-
ican communities; 
Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday com-
memorates May 5, 1862, the date on which 
Mexicans defeated the French at the Battle 
of Puebla, one of the many battles that the 
Mexican people won in their long and brave 
fight for independence, freedom, and democ-
racy; 
Whereas the victory of Mexico over France 
at Puebla represented a historic triumph for 
the Mexican government during the Franco- 
Mexican war fought between 1861 and 1867 
and bolstered the resistance movement; 
Whereas the success of Mexico at the Bat-
tle of Puebla reinvigorated the spirits of the 
Mexican people and provided a renewed sense 
of unity and strength; 
Whereas the French army, which had not 
experienced defeat against any of the finest 
troops of Europe in more than half a cen-
tury, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands 
of an outnumbered and ill-equipped, but 
highly spirited and courageous, Mexican 
army; 
Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexi-
can General Ignacio Zaragoza and his men 
displayed during that historic battle can 
never be forgotten; 
Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo 
symbolizes the right of a free people to self- 
determination, just as Benito Juarez, the 
president of Mexico during the Battle of 
Puebla, once said, ‘‘El respeto al derecho 
ajeno es la paz’’, meaning ‘‘respect for the 
rights of others is peace’’; 
Whereas the sacrifice of Mexican fighters 
was instrumental in keeping Mexico from 
falling under European domination while, in 
the United States, the Union Army battled 
Confederate forces in the Civil War; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a re-
minder that the foundation of the United 
States was built by people from many coun-
tries and diverse cultures who were willing 
to fight and die for freedom; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a re-
minder of the close ties between the people 
of Mexico and the people of the United 
States; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo encourages the 
celebration of a legacy of strong leaders and 
a sense of vibrancy in communities; and 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a re-
minder to provide more opportunity for fu-
ture generations: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the historic struggle of the 
people of Mexico for independence and free-
dom, which Cinco de Mayo commemorates; 
and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe Cinco de Mayo with appro-
priate ceremonies and activities.

NOMINATION OF PHILIP S. 
GOLDBERG 
Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, this 
evening, I come to the floor of the U.S. 
Senate in order to move that we con-
firm Philip S. Goldberg to serve as the 
U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of 
Korea. Ambassador Goldberg currently 
serves as U.S. Ambassador to Colom-
bia. 
We saw, just yesterday, North Korea 
test a ballistic missile. We have seen 
North Korea continue to develop and 
test ballistic missiles that threaten not 
just South Korea, not just our allies in 
the region but the United States and 
the entire world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

May 5, 2022 
United States has in the world. And as 
the Presiding Officer knows, in our 
home State of Georgia, a vibrant Ko-
rean-American community thrives, and 
Georgia is a key destination for Korean 
investment, bringing technology, jobs, 
talent, and opportunity to our State 
and to the entire country. 
We need a U.S. Ambassador to lead 
our mission in South Korea. I had the 
privilege of leading an economic dele-
gation to South Korea in the middle of 
last year. I sat down at that time with 
now President-elect Yoon, then-Can-
didate Yoon. When he was running for 
President, I congratulated him on his 
election. I look forward to working 
with him. 
I had the pleasure last month, along-
side Senators SULLIVAN and SCHATZ, to 
host his special delegation to Wash-
ington and meet with the Foreign Min-
ister Designate, Dr. Park. This alliance 
is essential, and we have to strengthen 
it. In order to strengthen it, we need to 
confirm our Ambassador to South 
Korea.
