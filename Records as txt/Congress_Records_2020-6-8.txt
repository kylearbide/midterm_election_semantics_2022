PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord of love and mercy, thank You 
for giving us another day. 
As thousands of Americans fill the 
streets of towns and cities throughout 
the country, we know that there is a 
great movement of spirit in our Na-
tion. We know not where it leads. 
Fill us with Your spirit of discern-
ment and good judgment, that the na-
tional dialogue might issue forth in a 
community more consonant with the 
founding principles of our Nation. 
Cleanse us of the racism that we must 
own as our historical failures still to 
actualize one nation under You, with 
liberty and justice for all. 
Through it all, continue to bless and 
protect those protesting, but also those 
members of police departments and se-
curity units charged with protecting 
and serving our communities. 
As well, dear Lord, continue to pro-
tect Your people during this time of 
pandemic, and inspire those medical 
professionals who labor through these 
times to find a treatment and protec-
tion against the coronavirus. 
Bless us this day, and every day, and 
may all that we do and can do for our 
neighbors be for Your greater honor 
and glory. 
Amen.

S2747 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JUNE 8, 2020 
No. 105 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, amid these challenging 
times, use our lawmakers to do the 
work of freedom. May they strive to 
protect and defend the Constitution of 
the United States to the best of their 
abilities. Inspire our Senators to find 
creative ways to mitigate the effects of 
the painful blows that have hit this 
land we love. 
As our legislators strive to become 
instruments for Your glory, sustain 
them with Your Grace. Lord, give them 
wisdom to seek to understand and help 
one another to seize the opportunities 
that accompany nearly every crisis. 
Provide them with clear minds, clean 
hands, and courageous hearts in this 
grand and difficult time. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING 
REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is 
no longer business as usual in America, 
so let’s end business as usual in Wash-
ington. 
We are experiencing a deadly pan-
demic. The United States is firing on 
all cylinders to fight it and to find a 
vaccine, but it does us no good if Amer-
icans can’t even afford the vaccine or 
related treatments. Even before the 
coronavirus 
outbreak 
reached 
our 
shores, President Trump called upon 
Congress to deliver a bill to his desk 
that lowered drug prices for Ameri-
cans. He mentioned that in his State of 
the Union message. The Prescription 
Drug Pricing Reduction Act does just 
that. It is time for Congress to support 
the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, all 
across our Nation, the past few days 
have seemed to mark a turn for the 
better. 
On Friday morning, new data showed 
that the economic fallout from this 
pandemic may have bottomed out and 
begun to turn around weeks earlier 
than had been predicted. Instead of los-
ing millions more jobs in the month of 
May, our Nation had already begun 
adding 
back 
millions 
of 
jobs. 
Lockdowns are easing, and businesses 
are reopening. The greatest country in 
world history is coming back online, 
and our citizens are getting their jobs 
back by the millions. 
Now, there is no question our na-
tional comeback is just beginning. The 
coronavirus is still with us. We have a 
long way to go to rebuild and recover 
from the historic layoffs of this spring, 
but already, even in these early days of 
our careful reopening, the American 
people are trouncing the predictions 
and starting to come back strong. 
What is more, this weekend saw mil-
lions of Americans, once again, take to 
the streets and town squares to protest 
the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, and other Black Americans at 
the hands of law enforcement. Yet, un-
like what our Nation faced about a 
week ago, this weekend’s demonstra-
tions seemed to have been almost en-
tirely 
peaceful—no 
more 
rampant 
looting, no more police precincts set on 
fire. By and large, there had been just 
peaceful protests in our great Amer-
ican tradition. 
In my home State of Kentucky, in 
Louisville, just like around the Nation, 
hundreds 
gathered 
to 
remember 
Breonna Taylor on what would have 
been her 27th birthday and to continue 
to call for answers. In Lexington, a mo-
ment of silence was held at an historic 
former slave market. Then a group 
marched to police headquarters. Police 
officers, including the chief, came out 
and met them in civil discourse. And, 
while a lot of ink has been spilled re-
cently about our big cities, we cannot 
miss that this moment is echoing 
throughout smalltown America as well. 
In Henderson, in western Kentucky, 
200 people—protesters, law enforce-
ment, and local leaders alike—gathered 
for an interfaith prayer vigil. In south-
eastern Kentucky, in Corbin, more 
than 100 gathered for a peaceful dem-
onstration that included a prayerful 
moment of silence. The police officers 
keeping watch joined in. In Hazard, a 
town of about 5,000 people in eastern 
Kentucky, citizens gathered for what 
they called a ‘‘march of love.’’ It was 
the same story in Benton, in Danville, 
in Morehead—all around the Common-
wealth and all around the country. Our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2748 
June 8, 2020 
country has remembered that peace 
and protest can and must coexist. 
The vast majority of the men and 
women in law enforcement across our 
country are not evil, are not racist, do 
not wake up every morning looking for 
violence. We are reminded of their 
bravery every time a citizen needs to 
dial 9–1–1, and they rush toward dan-
ger. We were all reminded again this 
past weekend, as these professionals 
bravely kept watch over demonstra-
tions, including ones where they them-
selves had been called racist or evil or 
were denigrated in the worst ways be-
cause of their uniforms and their 
badges. 
So, if peaceful protesters rightly do 
not want to be lumped in with a subset 
of looters and rioters who seek destruc-
tion, then the vast majority of brave 
police officers cannot be lumped in 
with the very worst examples of hei-
nous behavior. It is that simple. But, 
instead, we are already seeing out-
landish calls to defund the police or to 
abolish the police take root within the 
leftwing leadership class. The president 
of the City Council in Minneapolis has 
proclaimed she can ‘‘imagine a future 
without police.’’ One of her fellow 
council members put it even more 
clearly: ‘‘This council is going to dis-
mantle this police department.’’ 
To be clear as to what this effort is 
about, one of the local groups inform-
ing this push in Minnesota has literally 
stated that arts programs and mental 
health resources will be more effective 
at stopping crime than will be armed 
cops. Instead of ‘‘strangers armed with 
guns,’’ they say other professionals 
like social workers should be the ones 
to ‘‘respond to crises in our commu-
nity.’’ 
I am all for social work and mental 
health, but call me old-fashioned—I 
think you may actually want a police 
officer to stop a criminal and arrest 
him before we try to work through his 
feelings. 
Well, even if some leftwing leaders 
fall for this nonsense, I have a feeling 
the American people are too smart for 
that. They know that what happened 
to George Floyd was totally abhorrent. 
They also know that riots and looting 
are unacceptable. They also know that 
well-trained law enforcement officers 
are an important part of creating safe 
communities, not something to defund 
or abolish. 
So I am proud that Americans across 
the country can protest in safety and 
peace. I am proud that their neighbors 
continue to answer the call to protect 
and to serve, and I am hopeful that, 
with unity and mutual respect, we can 
continue this important national dis-
cussion to ensure justice and equal pro-
tection under the law. 
f 
GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
an entirely different subject, while the 
Senate remains the only Chamber in 
this Capitol with its lights on, we are 
going to continue with legislative work 
for the country. We will take our first 
vote today to advance the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act—a generational bill 
from Senator DAINES
and Senator 
GARDNER—that will secure the future 
of our Nation’s natural treasures. 
America is home to 419 national park 
sites, 567 national wildlife refuges, and 
hundreds of millions of acres of public 
lands. Every year, millions of Ameri-
cans turn to these lands for recreation, 
inspiration, and for their livelihoods. 
These resources exist because of the vi-
sionary actions of prior Congresses. 
Now it is our turn to secure them for 
generations yet to come. 
Our colleagues’ legislation does two 
big things: It improves access to parks 
and public lands by investing in main-
tenance and upkeep, and it secures per-
manent support for the missions of the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
Their legislation has already per-
suaded 59 cosponsors here in the Sen-
ate. It has earned the bipartisan en-
dorsement of the last six former Secre-
taries of the Interior, and a diverse co-
alition of independent advocates—from 
The Nature Conservancy to the Out-
door Industry Association to the Amer-
ican Battlefield Trust—have called on 
us to pass this bill. 
This bill has unusually broad, bipar-
tisan, and vocal support because the 
issues at hand affect so many different 
communities 
so 
concretely. 
Every 
year, visitors to America’s national 
parks bring more than $40 billion in 
economic impact to the gateway towns 
that surround them. The State and 
local parks, stewarded by the LWCF, 
help to generate another $166 billion in 
local economic activity and support 
more than 1.1 million jobs. 
My fellow Kentuckians and I know 
this firsthand. At least 120,000 jobs are 
supported by active outdoor recreation 
in the Commonwealth. From hunters 
and anglers in the Daniel Boone Na-
tional Forest to tourists visiting Mam-
moth Cave, our State’s natural treas-
ures occasion nearly $13 billion in an-
nual consumer spending. Yet Kentuck-
ians also know that tight budgets for 
maintenance often mean that historic 
sites go without important repairs and 
upgrades that would ensure safe access 
and smooth operations. So we are 
acutely aware of the need to address 
the 
deferred 
maintenance 
backlog, 
which this legislation tackles head-on. 
So I am very grateful to our col-
leagues from Montana and Colorado for 
shepherding this legislation. I am 
proud of the stand they have taken in 
support of our Nation’s natural won-
ders and the millions of American live-
lihoods that depend on them. I look 
forward to discussing this landmark 
legislation more in the days ahead, to 
supporting it here on the floor, and to 
urging every one of my colleagues to 
join in.

RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

PROTESTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
‘‘Equal 
Justice 
Under 
Law’’—those 
words are etched in stone above the 
doors of the Supreme Court, a bedrock 
principle of the American system. 
These past few weeks have been a sear-
ing reminder of how that principle does 
not reflect the lived experience for 
many Americans. 
For Black Americans, confrontations 
with the police are not the same as for 
White Americans. You can be standing 
on a street corner like Eric Garner or 
asleep in your bed like Breonna Taylor 
and have your life ended by police. 
George Floyd’s brutal death at the 
hands of a White police officer in Min-
neapolis 
sparked 
peaceful 
protests 
across this country because as singular 
and tragic as the death of George Floyd 
was, his experience was one that reso-
nated with far too many Black Ameri-
cans. 
That is why hundreds of thousands of 
Americans have engaged in peaceful 
demonstrations against police violence 
and systemic racism. From Los Ange-
les to Washington, DC, and from Se-
attle to New York City, where I joined 
shoulder to shoulder with my fellow 
New Yorkers on Saturday, Americans 
from all walks of life have marched, 
sang, prayed, cried, and spoken out 
that Black lives matter; that our coun-
try promises justice for all but too 
often only delivers it for some.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2749 
June 8, 2020 
The protests weren’t confined to big 
cities. Thousands turned out in Allen-
town and Fayetteville, PA; in Fair-
mont, WV; and in Havre, MT. There 
were Black Lives Matter protests in 
Vidor, TX, a city with a troubled his-
tory as a haven for the KKK, and Har-
vard, NE, a city with only 1,000 resi-
dents. 
Remarkably, though these protests 
concerned events within our borders, 
they sparked outrage far outside of 
them. The name ‘‘George Floyd’’ was 
chanted in Rome, Paris, London, Am-
sterdam, Berlin, and Mexico City. This 
is a rare moment for our Nation’s his-
tory. Injustice stares us so plainly in 
the face that the great mass of our peo-
ple are demanding change. The institu-
tions of our government and our de-
mocracy have an obligation to answer. 
Today, we are taking the first of 
many necessary steps to respond to our 
national pain with bold action. This 
morning, I joined with Speaker PELOSI 
and several of our House colleagues, 
Representatives BASS, CLYBURN, NAD-
LER, and JEFFRIES, as well as my col-
leagues, Senators BOOKER and HARRIS, 
to introduce the Justice in Policing 
Act—a response to the recent protests 
and the years of failure to reform our 
police departments. 
The Justice in Policing Act proposes 
crucial reforms to combat racial bias 
and excessive force by law enforce-
ment. It would ban the use of choke 
holds and other tactics that have left 
Black Americans dead. It would limit 
the transfer of military weaponry and 
equipment to police departments. It 
would change the legal standard to 
make it easier to hold police account-
able for misconduct when they use 
deadly force on American citizens. 
Through increased data and trans-
parency, as well as important modi-
fications to training and practices, it 
would help prevent police misconduct 
in the first place. This has never been 
done before at the Federal level, and it 
would encourage the same changes at 
the State and local level in order for 
those police departments to receive 
Federal funds. 
In the Senate, Democrats are going 
to fight like hell to make this proposal 
a reality. Americans who took to the 
streets have demanded change. With 
this legislation, Democrats are heeding 
their call. Now is the time for Leader 
MCCONNELL to commit to putting po-
lice reform on the floor of the Senate 
before July 4 to be debated and voted 
on. Several Republicans have acknowl-
edged the egregious wrongs, but too 
few have expressed a need for floor ac-
tion. Too many have remained silent. 
Maybe our Republican friends are hop-
ing the issue goes away. I promise 
them it will not. Democrats will not 
let this go away, and we will not rest 
until we achieve real reforms. 
Leader MCCONNELL, let’s have the de-
bate not just on TV and Twitter but on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. We need 
legislation and debate. A divided na-
tion cannot wait for healing and for so-
lutions. The Republican majority must 
not continue to squander the Senate’s 
time on rightwing judges and con-
spiracy hearings. History will judge 
whether this Chamber responds to the 
Nation’s pain with action or lets an old 
and terrible wound in our society con-
tinue to fester. 
The poison of racism affects more 
than our criminal justice system. It 
runs much deeper than that. There are 
racial 
disparities 
in 
housing 
and 
healthcare, education and the econ-
omy, income and wealth, and COVID 
has only placed a magnifying glass on 
all these forms of inequality. 
There are now 118,000 confirmed 
deaths from COVID in the United 
States. Black Americans have died at a 
disproportionate rate. As hospitals and 
healthcare workers have scrambled to 
secure enough supplies and create 
enough space, those institutions that 
serve communities of color have been 
the most strained. As our medical cri-
sis led to an economic crisis, it is 
largely African Americans and Latinos 
who have seen their jobs disappear 
faster and more permanently. 
The President is evidently prepared 
to declare the fight against COVID–19 
over because 15 percent of our coun-
try’s citizens are unemployed, not 20 
percent, even though that figure—15 
percent—is higher than at any point 
during the Great Recession. The reason 
unemployment 
isn’t 
as 
shockingly 
awful as it might have been was that 
Congress leapt into action at the out-
set of the pandemic and passed a major 
bill, the CARES Act, to keep the coun-
try afloat. The bill that eventually 
passed was bipartisan, but Democrats 
had to push Republicans almost every 
step of the way to get many of the im-
provements in the bill. Much of the aid 
the bill gave to unemployment, to our 
healthcare systems, and to truly small 
businesses was because Democrats in-
sisted. 
If the President and Senate Repub-
licans declare victory too early, if they 
lull into complacency now, and if they 
wait too long to pass another round of 
emergency relief, the economic condi-
tions in our country will deteriorate. If 
we do nothing, more Americans will 
lose their jobs, more Americans will 
lose their healthcare, more Americans 
will struggle to put food on the table 
and keep a roof over their head, and 
more Americans will see small busi-
nesses they sweated so hard to create 
fail. 
We fear that the recent bump in the 
employment number, caused in large 
part because of the stimulus money we 
pumped into the economy, will create, 
in Republicans, a sense of compla-
cency, and the economy will get even 
worse. 
The fact that we are confronted by so 
many 
challenges—so 
many 
chal-
lenges—can seem overwhelming. The 
fact and the consequences of Repub-
lican inaction, the fact that they fall 
so heavily on Black and Brown Ameri-
cans is so confounding, but there is no 
reason that we cannot respond to this 
moment of national crisis with vig-
orous and sustained action, with pur-
poseful action and bipartisan effort on 
the COVID pandemic and long, sim-
mering issues of police violence and ra-
cial justice. We must do both. 
That is what the Senate, supposedly 
the world’s greatest deliberative body, 
was designed to do. There are four re-
maining weeks before July 4. The time 
for waiting is gone. Leader MCCONNELL 
and Senate Republicans must commit 
to putting a police reform bill on the 
Senate floor for debate and a vote. 
They must commit to working with us 
on another emergency relief package. 
We have waited too long already. Let 
me repeat. Leader MCCONNELL and Sen-
ate Republicans, we must accomplish 
two things before July 4: police reform 
and COVID relief. We can and must do 
both. Do not stand in the way of a na-
tion yearning for solutions—not for 
empty rhetoric, not for name-calling, 
and not for partisanship. 
Before I yield the floor, I want to 
mention one other issue. Last week, 
President Trump was responsible for 
ordering 
Federal 
officers 
to 
force 
peaceful 
protesters 
from 
Lafayette 
Square—just across the street from the 
White House—in clear violation of 
their First Amendment rights of free-
dom of speech and assembly. It was 
deeply offensive and wrong. Even more 
appalling was the purpose of the order: 
to clear a path for the President to 
stage a political stunt at nearby St. 
John’s Church. 
Today, Lafayette Square, a place 
which has long been a venue where 
Americans gather to freely exercise 
their constitutional rights, remains 
blocked off by heavy fencing. The 
President has converted this unique 
public park in the heart of the Nation’s 
Capital into something resembling a 
militarized 
zone. 
Lafayette 
Square 
should be a symbol of freedom and 
openness to the world, not a place be-
hind which the President cowers in fear 
of peaceful protesters crying out for 
justice. 
So, moments ago, Speaker PELOSI 
and I sent a letter to President Trump 
urging 
him 
to 
reopen 
Lafayette 
Square. President Trump, tear down 
these walls and allow the public to 
gather in front of the White House for 
you and for all the world to hear their 
voices. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about the Great American Out-
doors Act that we may be debating this 
week. I am hoping that we can find a 
responsible way to pay for the mainte-
nance backlog of our national parks. 
Our national parks are an important 
source of pride for our country. They 
are known internationally. We had the 
first national park in the world with 
Yellowstone Park. Unfortunately, our 
parks are in the midst of a rising crisis

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2750 
June 8, 2020 
that has been building over many 
years. They are in desperate need of re-
pair and maintenance and fixing them 
will require billions of dollars. 
This week, the Senate is working on 
legislation to address this backlog, and 
I believe it is vital that we address this 
issue both responsibly and perma-
nently. This will help generations to 
fix problems in our parks without hav-
ing to put the cost on the Nation’s 
credit card. We can pay now or we can 
make our kids pay through reduced 
Federal help and services that we are 
used to, or we can figure out a way to 
have a small fee now. It should be a 
pretty easy choice. 
Unfortunately, the Great American 
Outdoors Act, as written, represents 
only a one-time fix and is neither re-
sponsible nor permanent. Instead, the 
bill adds over $17 billion to our na-
tional debt. Moreover, the measure in-
cludes a permanent reauthorization of 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
Program, which will add even more fu-
ture maintenance to our already back-
logged systems without being paid for. 
After all of the spending we have just 
undertaken, we must be more vigilant 
in finding proper ways to ensure our 
government spending is paid for, and 
fixing this bill can be an important 
place to start. Without some changes, 
this legislation will force our country 
to borrow more money, burying us 
deeper in debt, and only provide fund-
ing for 5 years. 
I am also concerned that the bill 
tries to spend the same money twice, 
which is using a budget gimmick. We 
should always strive to be fiscally re-
sponsible, and that is even more impor-
tant now after Congress has spent more 
than $2 trillion to respond to the 
coronavirus pandemic. To address the 
current park’s backlog, it would cost 
nearly $12 billion, according to the Na-
tional Park Service. In comparison, 
last year, the entire national budget 
for the national parks was $4.1 billion. 
Let me repeat that. The cost would be 
$12 billion to take care of the backlog. 
Their whole budget last year was just 
$4.1 billion. 
Congress is already struggling to find 
funding for other worthwhile Federal 
needs. That is why, for the past several 
years, I have worked on a fix. I filed an 
amendment to this bill that addresses 
the maintenance issues responsibly and 
permanently without adding to our 
debt. Let me repeat that. My amend-
ment is completely offset and provides 
a permanent solution. It has been ig-
nored, so far, through this process. 
The way my amendment works is by 
asking our foreign visitors, who num-
bers show are increasingly enjoying 
our parks, to pay $16 or $25 more when 
they enter the country as part of their 
visa fee—a part of it—not a big in-
crease compared to that. 
According to a study by the U.S. 
Travel Association, nearly 40 percent 
of the people who come to the United 
States from abroad are visiting one or 
more of our national parks. That is 
over 14 million people who come from 
abroad and visit our national parks. 
It is great that people from all over 
the world recognize the value of these 
national treasures, but this increased 
visitation is adding to the maintenance 
backlog, and it is only fair that we ask 
them to help maintain these national 
treasures. 
There is nothing novel about this 
concept. Anyone who has visited an at-
traction outside of the United States 
has probably encountered such fees in 
one way or another. For example, for-
eign visitors to the Taj Mahal in India 
will pay an $18 fee, compared to a fee of 
only 56 cents for local visitors. At 
Kruger National Park in South Africa, 
visitors from outside the country will 
pay $25 per day compared to $6.25 for 
local visitors. 
Many 
European 
countries—like 
Spain, France, and Italy—charge a 
tourist tax on hotel rooms that is used 
to pay for tourism infrastructure. 
We also ask park visitors to assist 
with addressing the backlog. No one 
likes to pay more for things, especially 
during times like these, but to main-
tain these national treasures for future 
generations, we either borrow money 
and put it on the national credit card 
or we take some modest steps to ad-
dress the issue responsibly—kind of a 
pay-as-you-go. 
My amendment only raises entrance 
fees by $5 and annual passes by $20, so 
bringing a vehicle into the park would 
still be cheaper than taking a family of 
four to a movie or visiting an amuse-
ment park for a day. In fact, it is a real 
bargain from that. 
We, as a nation, have seen the joy 
our national parks bring to those who 
venture and visit them. In Wyoming 
and all across the country, America’s 
national parks are something to be 
proud of and protect. We owe it to the 
parks and to the citizens and foreign 
visitors who partake of their wonders 
to keep them in good working order. 
We should not allow the maintenance 
and repairs to fester, which erodes vis-
itor experiences and costs billions to 
fix. 
Are people going to the parks? Yes, 
they are. Yellowstone National Park 
has opened up now and I think is at 
about 75 percent of capacity already. I 
read in the papers about this family 
from Georgia who was planning on tak-
ing their family to Florida to Disney 
World, but Disney World is closed, so 
they drove across the country to Wyo-
ming and went to Yellowstone Na-
tional Park. One of the adventures 
they got was to get to see a real wolf 
up close and personal. They got some 
good pictures of it too. 
People will travel a long way to see 
these parks. They don’t expect them to 
be an international bargain, and nei-
ther do foreign visitors who are used to 
seeing us, when we go to their country, 
pay a higher fee for national parks. 
We need to fix our national parks. 
The question is, Will we pay as it is 
used or will we force our kids and 
grandkids to pay for something they 
maybe never got to enjoy? We can put 
a small addition on foreign visa fees or 
we can pass it on to our kids. 
Let’s do one amendment that will 
pay for parks in perpetuity, not just 
gimmick spending for 5 years. Fixing 
this bill will help ensure we no longer 
have to put our parks’ current obliga-
tions on the backs of future genera-
tions. 
I know the item at stake here will 
not end our fiscal crisis, but if we can’t 
do something modest to start to ad-
dress our spending addiction, then we 
are in greater trouble than I ever 
thought. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
REFORM 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over 
the last few months, America has expe-
rienced a trifecta of crises, which are 
reminiscent of some of the most dif-
ficult periods in our Nation’s history. 
In many ways, it feels like we are 
learning what it was like to live 
through the Spanish flu pandemic, the 
Great Depression, and the civil rights 
movement—all at once. 
This period has challenged all of us 
physically, economically, and emotion-
ally, and while we still have a long way 
to go, we are seeing incremental signs 
of progress. Last week, New York 
City—once the epicenter of COVID–19 
cases—reported 
no 
confirmed 
coronavirus deaths. That was the first 
time that had happened since March 11. 
Our economy is experiencing positive 
improvement as well. Friday’s jobs re-
port showed that employment rose by 
2.5 million people in May—an abso-
lutely astonishing and recordbreaking 
figure. I think that is the first time 
that happened since 1934. Unemploy-
ment dropped to 13.3 percent. That is 
still way too high but a sharp contrast 
from the expectations and projections 
of economists. 
While we are seeing the needle move 
in the right direction in our fight to 
defeat the coronavirus and restore our 
economy, the third in this trio of crises 
is much more complex. The murder of 
George Floyd has sparked passion and 
anger throughout our country and gal-
vanized people of all skin colors, back-
grounds, and ages to demand action. In 
big cities and small towns alike, we 
have seen peaceful marches and power-
ful demonstrations calling for an end 
to racial injustice that has existed 
sadly since our country’s inception. 
One of the largest protests in the 
country happened last week in Mr. 
Floyd’s hometown in Houston, TX, 
where I was born and where he will be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2751 
June 8, 2020 
buried tomorrow. An estimated 60,000 
people gathered to march in his honor 
and demand justice. 
The first step in justice for George 
Floyd, and now that all four officers in-
volved in his death have been arrested 
and charged, is for the criminal justice 
system to work. But these four arrests 
do not erase the larger problems that 
exist in our society—the lack of trust, 
the sense that justice is not equal. In 
fact, they have only shined a brighter 
light on the systemic problems that we 
need to do our best to try to address. 
Making lasting changes will not be 
quick or easy. 
At the rally in Houston, several of 
Mr. Floyd’s family members spoke, and 
one said: ‘‘This is going to be more like 
a marathon.’’ I think that is pretty re-
alistic. It is going to take some time, 
and it will be the result of difficult dis-
cussions but necessary discussions that 
are happening in homes, workplaces, 
and buildings like this all across the 
country. 
No one has all the answers, but there 
is a lot we can learn—first, by simply 
listening to one another. Earlier today, 
I was able to speak to George Floyd’s 
family and do just that—listen. They 
have gone through unimaginable pain 
over these last 2 weeks. 
I told them I am committed to mak-
ing sure that George Floyd receives 
justice. I said: In my experience during 
times like this, the best comfort you 
can offer to someone who has lost a 
loved one is that their death will not 
be in vain; that something good will 
come out of it. 
We know some of the most important 
reforms that need to be made are in 
our criminal justice system. The tragic 
events of Minneapolis, Louisville, and 
a number of other cities across the 
country have renewed calls to trans-
form policing practices and repair the 
divide that exists between some com-
munities and the police. Of course, 
much of that will take place at the 
local and State level. It is, in fact, the 
city council and mayors who hire the 
police chief and make sure they are 
running their programs and their de-
partments with integrity and profes-
sionalism. That is where most of the 
important decisions about day-to-day 
policing and procedures are made. 
One example in my State is the San-
dra Bland Act, which Governor Abbott 
signed into law in 2017. The namesake 
of that bill was a Black woman who 
was found dead in a county jail days 
after being arrested during a routine 
traffic stop. The law passed in her 
honor made a number of changes, in-
cluding requiring deescalation training 
for law enforcement officials, much 
like we have done in the mental health 
space. 
The individual police departments 
are the ones that make decisions about 
specific 
practices, 
responsible, 
of 
course, to their city leadership, such as 
banning knee holds or choke holds. 
There 
are 
important 
conversations 
taking place across Texas and the 
country about how we can effectively 
promote and improve police practices 
and begin to repair the damaged rela-
tionship between our minority commu-
nities and our police. 
To strengthen that work, there are 
steps we can take in Washington, DC. I 
know many of us are engaged in active 
discussions about what is the best way 
to create real change. I know it is a 
priority for Members on both sides of 
the aisle. 
One proposal I have mentioned is a 
bipartisan bill that I introduced with 
Senator GARY PETERS of Michigan and 
Chairman LINDSEY GRAHAM last year. 
This bill actually had 20 bipartisan co-
sponsors. It was endorsed not only by 
the Urban League and the NAACP but 
the major police organizations in this 
country as well. It passed unanimously 
in the Senate. Unfortunately, we ran 
out of time in the House so it did not 
actually become law—not yet. 
This legislation creates a National 
Criminal Justice Commission, much 
like the 9/11 Commission, that would 
review our criminal justice system writ 
large from top to bottom—something 
that has not happened since 1965. In 18 
months, the Commission would report 
back to us and make recommendations 
for changes that could be considered 
and passed by the Congress. 
This would allow us to systemically 
look at what is working and what isn’t 
and what needs to be done to mod-
ernize our criminal justice system, in-
cluding repairing the broken relation-
ship between law enforcement and 
some of our minority communities. 
The review that took place in 1965 
produced 1,200 specific recommenda-
tions, and it is past time to once again 
take stock of the successes and failures 
of our criminal justice system. 
As I mentioned, the bill that passed 
the Senate unanimously had 20 bipar-
tisan cosponsors and was supported by 
the National Association of Police Or-
ganizations, Major City Chiefs Associa-
tion, the National Urban League. 
I believe this type of legislation 
would give us the basic framework for 
the lasting changes that we are all 
after. It would be an umbrella commis-
sion under which a lot of very specific 
and granular issues could be debated 
and voted on and, if meritorious, 
passed and become part of the law. 
I hope it will become a part of our 
conversation that we are having in the 
coming days and weeks. Rooting out 
racial injustice that has existed for 
generations will require a long-term, 
bipartisan commitment in Congress 
and in homes and institutions across 
the country. 
I do believe it is simply wrong to 
paint all police and all law enforce-
ment as somehow racially biased. I 
think that is not deserved, and I think 
it is just flat wrong and irresponsible. 
Clearly, when there are cases of abuse, 
where even a police officer crosses the 
line, they need to be held accountable, 
and we need to be focused on identi-
fying those individuals not only in 
prosecuting them but in sending a mes-
sage that that sort of action will not be 
tolerated in a civilized society. And 
next, we need to regain the confidence 
for all of our people or all colors; that 
the police are our friend and a nec-
essary part of our ordered liberty. 
Without order, you have anarchy. 
Only with order, fair laws justly ad-
ministered on an equal basis can we 
enjoy the liberty that is part of our 
birthright in America. I am committed 
to being part of the solution, and I am 
eager to roll up my sleeves with all of 
our colleagues and get to work. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am on the floor to talk about the his-
toric opportunity that is before this 
body this evening and throughout the 
week to be able to help us get our na-
tional parks back on track. These are 
our treasured national parks that are 
such a great asset to our country, and 
right now they are in trouble. 
One of the bills before us this week, 
in what is called the Great American 
Outdoors Act, is the bipartisan Restore 
Our Parks Act. It directs Federal fund-
ing from royalties on oil and gas leases 
and other energy leases to Federal 
lands. It directs that funding to our na-
tional parks to take care of deferred 
maintenance. 
Why 
is 
this 
investment 
needed? 
Thanks to the wisdom of Teddy Roo-
sevelt, who had the foresight to set 
aside and preserve some of our most 
spectacular land for public use, and 
thanks to so many friends of the parks 
who have followed, America’s national 
parks are without equal. The National 
Park Service and its system now com-
prise 84 million acres of land and his-
torical sites that now attracts 330 mil-
lion visitors every year. In fact, from 
2006 to 2017, annual visitation in our 
parks increased by about 58 million 
people. They are popular. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, it is 
clear there is a lot of demand to be in 
the out-of-doors. And so I believe as we 
start to reopen our parks this summer, 
which we will do soon, Americans will 
be all the more eager to go out to our 
parks and explore our country’s nat-
ural beauty and explore its history. 
The problem is that when people 
head to the parks, they may be sur-
prised that things are a little rundown. 
This isn’t new. It has been happening 
to our parks for decades, actually. 
Some of the trails will be closed. Some 
of the bathrooms aren’t going to be 
working. In places, roads and bridges 
will be crumbling, and visitor centers 
that have leaks in their roofs will be

closed. It is a widespread problem of 
deferred maintenance that has gradu-
ally grown to become a huge backlog of 
around $12 billion at our national park 
sites. That is $12 billion in deferred 
maintenance that has not been taken 
care of. 
The good news is, with my colleagues 
Senator WARNER, Senator ALEXANDER, 
and Senator KING, we introduced this 
commonsense solution a few years ago 
called Restore our Parks Act. It will 
address this backlog. 
To me, this is a debt unpaid. It would 
have been a lot smarter to pay it all 
along, by the way, but our annual ap-
propriations here in Congress were 
never big enough, so what funds we had 
available went for things like park 
rangers, for programming, and, frank-
ly, for applying bandaids to some of 
these maintenance problems. 
Other funds also, of course, went to 
expanding our parks. Let me make one 
thing clear: This bill before us today— 
the Restore Our Parks Act—is all 
about stewardship. It is about taking 
better care of what we have. Not a 
penny of it can be used for expansion. 
Of course, one of our challenges right 
now, as a country coming out of the 
coronavirus pandemic, is to figure out 
how to get people back to work, and it 
is a real challenge because, although 
the jobs report on Friday was encour-
aging in terms of some jobs being 
added in May, we still have one of the 
highest unemployment rates we have 
ever had in this country. 
One place we have an opportunity to 
get people back to work is, of course, 
rebuilding our infrastructure. There 
are lots of discussions about that. Well, 
this legislation does that. These are 
shovel-ready 
projects—infrastructure 
projects that are ready to go. 
Last week, the National Parks Serv-
ice released a new study that found 
that the Restore Our Parks Act will 
support 100,000 new jobs as we rebuild 
our national parks infrastructure over 
the next 5 years—40,000 direct jobs, 
about 60,000 indirect jobs—over 100,000 
total new jobs. 
By the way, these are good jobs. 
These are jobs with good pay and good 
benefits. 
I first became involved in this issue 
of our national parks because I have 
grown to love the parks, as do so many 
Americans. Even those who don’t have 
a chance to visit them very much are 
proud of the fact that we have this in-
credible system, this true treasure for 
our country. 
When I was about 12 years old, my 
mom and dad took us to Yellowstone 
Park, and we went camping, and we 
saw the geysers, and we got to see 
things that I had never seen before— 
just this spectacular park in the West. 
This amazing park system that we 
have in this country continues to be 
something I am proud of. So ever since 
I was 12 years old, I have been a parks 
fan. 
We have eight national parks in my 
home State of Ohio. One of those is 
called the Cuyahoga Valley National 
Park, which is our largest single park. 
It is actually the thirteenth most vis-
ited park in the country. You may not 
have heard of it, but it is an awesome 
park. It is kind of situated right in be-
tween Cleveland and Akron. It is a 
place where you can go biking; you can 
go hiking; you can go fishing; you can 
go kayaking; you can take a scenic 
railway through the park. It is a spec-
tacular place, and it is accessed by a 
lot of people, being so close to the sub-
urbs and even so close to the cities. It 
is not a typical park out in the rural 
area; it is a park that is really right up 
against the suburbs and close to the 
cities. I am proud to be one of the 2.7 
million visitors a year that goes to 
Cuyahoga Valley National Park to 
take advantage of all those things I 
talked about. 
In addition to these larger parks, our 
park system also includes a lot of other 
sites. As an Ohio example, in my home-
town of Cincinnati is the boyhood 
home of President William Howard 
Taft, who was both President and Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court. 
Like everywhere else in our park sys-
tem, all of these sites are getting run-
down. Why has this happened? Well, 
again, because every year we appro-
priate funding for the operations of the 
park—for nature programs, for rangers, 
for day-to-day operations and activi-
ties—but we haven’t provided enough 
money to provide for these mainte-
nance needs. 
Think about it in terms of your own 
family or your own home or your own 
business. Taking that big step and 
making those capital improvements is 
a big, big cost, and we don’t budget for 
that here very well. So we have allowed 
these maintenance projects to build up, 
meaning a lot of buildings, a lot of in-
frastructure—roads, bridges, water sys-
tems—are deteriorating to the point 
that a lot of them are really com-
pletely unusable. 
I have seen this firsthand as I have 
visited our Ohio parks. Here are a cou-
ple photos of some of the visits we have 
made. 
I go to Cuyahoga Valley National 
Park frequently, as I said, and there 
are always a lot of school field trips, a 
lot of hikers, a lot of other visitors. It 
is a great park, but it needs about $50 
million in repair—just that one park, 
Cuyahoga National Park. 
The railroad track is in such bad re-
pair—and it is behind me here—that it 
is dangerous or will be soon to go on 
that scenic railroad. So we have to fix 
the railroad tracks. Some of the trails 
seem to be falling apart because of ero-
sion. An $11 million budget is the an-
nual budget for that park, Cuyahoga 
Valley National Park. Again, it is the 
thirteenth most visited park in the 
country, yet they have a $50 million 
backlog—a $50 million backlog. So it is 
just not sustainable. 
I also visited the Perry monument a 
couple of times in the last couple of 
years, including last summer. Perry’s 
Victory and International Peace Me-
morial is on the shores of Lake Erie. It 
honors those who fought in the Battle 
of Lake Erie in the War of 1812, which 
was such a critically important battle 
for our victory. It also celebrates the 
long-lasting peace between the U.K., 
Canada, and the United States. So it is 
an important historical marker. 
There I saw some of the $48 million in 
long-delayed 
maintenance 
needs 
at 
that site, which includes millions in 
needed repairs to a concrete seawall— 
and here is the seawall. You can see 
some of the damage to it. There are 
also sinkholes behind me here. 
We have to repair that seawall, but, 
boy, it is a big cost. But if you don’t re-
pair it, you continue to have other 
damage, including the road behind me, 
and, obviously, people are not per-
mitted to go near the lake there. 
So $48 million is a lot for that small 
memorial, small national park. The 
visitors’ center there also needs up-
grades. It needs to be made ADA acces-
sible, an example—Americans with Dis-
abilities Act. Again, the budget for 
that park is miniscule, but the mainte-
nance needs are huge. 
It is not just our outdoor spaces that 
need work. The past 2 years I have vis-
ited the Taft home in Cincinnati where 
President William Howard Taft was 
born and raised. The house is still in 
pretty good condition, but there are in-
frastructure upgrades that have to be 
made—repairing the roof, repairing 
some of the woodwork. You can see the 
roof here and some of the mold. When 
you don’t repair the roof, what hap-
pens? The roof leaks, and the walls get 
moldy, and the floor begins to couple. 
So whether it is your house or wheth-
er it is our national parks, that is what 
is happening. 
We have to do this in order to ensure 
that the costs don’t expand even fur-
ther, which is what happens, again, in 
your own home. If you don’t fix that 
roof, you have all kinds of other prob-
lems, and they compound. 
The compounding problem in our na-
tional parks is not just $12 billion. If 
we don’t address it, it will grow to be 
much greater than that. The longer we 
wait, the more expensive it gets. The 
same story is true with all of our parks 
all around our country, and it is time 
for us to fix it. 
By the way, people ask me: Well, how 
do you know what the most urgent 
needs are? Because we require the 
parks to keep it. We require them to 
tell the U.S. Congress every year their 
highest priority needs, spell them out, 
in specific terms, what is needed—what 
the cost is, how long the repairs would 
take, and so on. This is why I said that 
they are shovel ready, because we 
know what these projects are. 
Here is the deferred maintenance 
cost in Ohio, as an example, just for 
Ohio—again, totaling $114 million. Here 
is the Perry’s Victory Memorial, $48 
million; here is the Cuyahoga Valley 
National Park at almost $52 million. 
Again, at some of our bigger parks 
around the country, the costs are even

higher. So this is an opportunity for us 
to do the right thing by these treasures 
that we have, to make sure they don’t 
continue to deteriorate. This is where 
our Restore Our Parks Act is so impor-
tant to pass. 
As I said earlier, this legislation is 
going to support more than 100,000 jobs 
and cut into that maintenance back-
log. What is even better about this leg-
islation is that taxpayers aren’t the 
ones footing the bill. Instead, this bill 
creates what is called the Legacy Res-
toration Fund, which will provide $1.9 
billion per year for 5 years from 50 per-
cent of the unobligated on- and off-
shore 
energy 
revenue. 
Again, 
this 
comes from on- and offshore oil, gas, 
and other energy projects. 
This means we will have $9.5 billion 
to be divided across the National Park 
Service and other Federal Land Man-
agement agencies. It will not fund 
every needed repair, but the $6.5 billion 
our parks are going to get will address 
all of the high priority items, so 6.5 out 
of 12, roughly half—a little more than 
half—of those projects, but it does 
comprise all of the high-priority items 
for our national parks. 
It is a win-win, especially right now. 
This enables us to restore our parks 
and our public lands—these great na-
tional treasures. It supports jobs at a 
time when people are anxious to get 
back to work, and it does all this by 
taking this funding that comes from 
the leases—oil, natural gas, and other 
energy projects. It is good for our econ-
omy. We need to get people back to 
work again, and it is an example of 
how Congress can pass laws that both 
create jobs and serve the public’s inter-
ests. 
It is particularly good news that we 
are voting on it this week, because the 
quicker we act, the better. 
I want to thank Majority Leader 
MITCH MCCONNELL for allowing us to 
bring this to the floor. I want to thank 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
who have worked so hard on this legis-
lation. Specifically, I want to thank 
Senator WARNER, who came up with 
this great idea of shifting the funding 
from the oil, gas, and other energy 
projects—some of these royalty mon-
eys—into this particular project. 
I have worked for years on parks. I 
am the author of the Centennial Act, 
which was back in 2016 for our national 
parks, which helps to get public-pri-
vate partnerships involved, which I 
strongly support. That has helped a lit-
tle bit on the maintenance, but it is 
not nearly enough money. So we need 
to do more, and that is what this legis-
lation does. 
I also want to thank Senator ALEX-
ANDER and Senator KING for their work 
on this national parks legislation. 
I also want to thank my other col-
leagues who have been so involved in 
this broader package. That would be 
Senator GARDNER, Senator MANCHIN, 
Senator DAINES. That is the Great 
American Outdoors Act. They helped 
me to put that together. 
This is the right thing to do for our 
country at the right time. 
I want to also say that the Trump ad-
ministration strongly supports this 
legislation, and that has been really 
important, too, to get it in the budget, 
to be sure that the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, where I used to 
serve, is on board, because the funding 
here is not our typical appropriations 
funding, and I thank them for that. I 
thank President Trump for helping us 
to ensure that this can come to the 
floor today and can actually get passed 
by the U.S. Congress and then signed 
into law. 
Let’s do it. On a bipartisan basis, 
let’s do something positive this week 
to move our country forward, to create 
more jobs, and to ensure that our won-
derful national parks are there for fu-
ture generations. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, 
today the Senate will take the first 
steps toward passing the great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, with the vote to in-
voke cloture on the motion to proceed 
to the House bill, which will be used as 
the underlying legislative vehicle. 
The majority of my Senate col-
leagues have cosponsored this bill, and 
we have an incredible opportunity to 
enact this important bipartisan legisla-
tion. 
I would be remiss if I did not ac-
knowledge that our Nation is in tur-
moil and hurting. We are still very 
much in the midst of both a health and 
economic crisis, and this weekend we 
saw millions of people join peaceful 
demonstrations in communities across 
the country. 
It is so important that we in Con-
gress take action, and I am so pleased 
that we have returned to legislating. 
There is no shortage of important busi-
ness for us to address as a body. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will create jobs while protecting and 
expanding access to the great outdoors 
across 
our 
country 
for 
everyone, 
whether that be hunting, fishing, or 
hiking in the Monongahela National 
Forest in my great State of West Vir-
ginia or rafting down the Gauley River 
or learning about Civil War history— 
just to give a few examples of what my 
home State of West Virginia has to 
offer. 
This is a legacy that we can all pass 
down to our grandchildren and genera-
tions to come, and it has been a long 
time coming. 
I want to thank my good friend Sen-
ator LISA MURKOWSKI for working with 
us through the committee process. I 
would also like to thank my col-
leagues, Senators GARDNER, WARNER, 
DAINES, CANTWELL, PORTMAN, KING, 
ALEXANDER, and HEINRICH, for their 
work over many years on the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund—or as we 
call it, LWCF—and deferred mainte-
nance bills that are now joined to-
gether in the Great American Outdoors 
Act. 
This bill would realize a goal that so 
many of us in this body have fought 
hard to attain for so long, to provide 
permanent, mandatory funding for the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund at 
its fully authorized level of $900 million 
annually. 
Last year, the Senate passed a public 
lands package by an overwhelming 
vote of 92 to 8 that permanently au-
thorized the LWCF—the most success-
ful land conservation program in our 
Nation’s history. A vote that bipar-
tisan is, unfortunately, unheard of 
today and speaks to the overwhelming 
popularity of conservation programs in 
every State in the country. 
The day after we secured permanent 
authorization of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, we made it clear 
that our next hurdle was achieving 
mandatory full funding. The Great 
American Outdoors Act includes the 
mandatory LWCF funding bill that I 
introduced, along with a lot of help 
from all my friends on both the Demo-
cratic and Republican sides. 
We had strong bipartisan support for 
mandatory LWCF funding, with the 
majority of the Senate cosponsoring 
the bill, and a strong bipartisan vote 
coming out of committee. 
We need to secure this funding be-
cause since the LWCF was established 
55 years ago, over $22 billion—think 
about that—over $22 billion has been 
deposited in the LWCF fund but was 
never appropriated and instead went 
into the Treasury. 
Although every State and territory 
and almost every county has benefited 
from LWCF, it has been fully funded 
only twice in the 55-year history—only 
twice have we gotten full funding. 
Think what we could have done with 
that $22 billion. 
Despite that, LWCF has been able to 
do wonderful things with the funds 
that have been appropriated, which in 
recent years have been at half of the 
authorized funding level and, in pre-
vious years, less than that. Just imag-
ine what we can achieve for our coun-
try with this full funding. 
The LWCF is the primary conserva-
tion funding tool that helps provide 
public access for hunting and fishing 
and recreational use of public lands. It 
also helps fund State and local parks. 
It helps maintain working forests 
through the Forest Legacy Program. It 
protects historic battlefields through 
the American Battlefield Protection 
Program, and it helps landowners vol-
untarily protect habitats for endan-
gered species. 
Permanent LWCF funding will im-
prove access to public lands, improving

access to hunting and fishing opportu-
nities, and will ensure the program re-
mains an important contributor to a 
strong and growing outdoor recreation 
economy that will benefit State and 
local economies throughout our Na-
tion. 
A recent analysis from Boston Uni-
versity shows that at full funding of 
$900 million a year, the LWCF could 
support approximately 15,000 to 28,000 
jobs at a time when our country needs 
them most. 
Passing permanent LWCF authoriza-
tion last year was an important step, 
and we are so close to realizing the ul-
timate goal of fully fulfilling the origi-
nal intent of the LWCF Program and 
securing a permanent, dedicated fund-
ing source for the multiple conserva-
tion programs funded by the LWCF. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
also includes $9.5 billion for deferred 
maintenance projects on Federal lands, 
with 70 percent of that amount dedi-
cated to our national parks. Senators 
PORTMAN, WARNER, ALEXANDER, KING, 
and many others worked so hard on 
that original legislation, and I was 
proud to cosponsor and support as it 
went through the Senate’s Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources. The 
legislation will be the most significant 
reduction ever in eliminating a major 
portion of the deferred maintenance 
backlog of our national parks and pub-
lic lands. 
The impact of failing to fund our na-
tional parks and maintenance for so 
long is clear to see. Last year, I visited 
Pearl Harbor with my family, and I 
was incredibly disappointed to see the 
state of disrepair it was in. There were 
faded and torn signs and audio displays 
and lights that were not working. It 
was an embarrassment. 
The infrastructure projects that will 
be funded through this bill are critical 
to protecting many of our national 
treasures. The LWCF funding will pro-
vide a significant benefit to the na-
tional outdoor recreation economy. In-
vesting 
in 
deferred 
maintenance 
projects will create over 40,000 direct 
jobs and over 100,000 total jobs, and 
that is just for deferred maintenance 
projects in our national parks. This bill 
also 
includes 
funding 
for 
deferred 
maintenance projects at other land 
management agencies and Bureau of 
Indian Education schools. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will help us to be good stewards of our 
public lands while, at the same time, 
creating thousands of new jobs—a bi-
partisan win-win, which we should 
have more of. We have broad, bipar-
tisan support, with 60 Senators signing 
on, which is representative of how im-
portant these bills are to every State 
and every county in every State. We 
have support from the administration 
and unwavering support from over 900 
conservation and sportsmen groups 
throughout the Nation. It is a shining 
example of Democrats and Republicans 
coming together to put politics aside 
to do what is best for conserving the 
natural resources of this great Nation. 
The passage of this bill will be an his-
toric achievement, and I believe this 
will be one of the most significant con-
servation bills ever enacted into law. 
What a legacy all of us can walk away 
with and look at our children and 
grandchildren, knowing that we have 
helped protect our wonderful national 
parks and outdoor recreation opportu-
nities. I ask all of my colleagues to 
join me in voting yes to invoke cloture 
this evening and begin consideration of 
the Great American Outdoors Act.

ator from Tennessee. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, this weekend, I was thinking 
about the toll that the recent loss of 
fellowship has really taken on the 
American people. 
I think everyone would agree that, 
over the past few months, we have real-
ly felt levels of loneliness, anger, and 
frustration that we have never experi-
enced in our lives. For most of us, it 
has been a long time since we have 
been able to gather with friends and 
family or to go to a church service. 
This isolation has brought to the sur-
face conflict that has been brewing for 
a very long time. For many years, pow-
erful forces in politics and popular cul-
ture have insisted that there is nothing 
we can’t learn from interacting with 
one another online. Technology has 
brought the world together under the 
premise of this false intimacy and con-
vinced millions of people that what 
they see on their screens is all they 
need to know about the world. 
There are many things that Ameri-
cans can rightfully disagree about, es-
pecially during an election year, but 
contrary to what our social media 
timelines would lead us to believe, 
most Americans have held onto the les-
sons we all should have learned when 
we were mere children. When we were 
little, we learned that, as Americans, 
we have a duty to fight hatred wher-
ever we find it, to be kind to one an-
other, to practice the Golden Rule. In-
stead of giving in to stereotypes and 
assumptions, we should reject our own 
biases and, instead, meet people where 
they are, with open arms and listening 
ears and loving hearts, and truly listen 
to what they have to say. 
There are destructive forces at work 
in this country that want the Amer-
ican people to forget these lessons and, 
instead, make a false choice between 
putting their beliefs into practice and 
protecting the institutions and sym-
bols that define our Republic. They 
want to convince you that this Nation 
is broken beyond repair. That is their 
goal: to undermine what you believe 
and to convince you that the path for-
ward must be forged at the expense of 
faith, hope, and free speech, free ex-
pression. This is a lie. Worse, it is an 
obvious lie to anyone who has studied 
our Nation’s precious history. For hun-
dreds of years, the American people 
have persevered in spite of conflict and 
more—civil unrest, economic down-
turns, and neighborly disagreements. 
That is what we are going to do now 
here in Washington, back at home in 
Tennessee, and in our communities. In-
stead of allowing Congress to come to a 
standstill, we will make and encourage 
strong policies that protect the Amer-
ican people. Even though the main-
stream media has temporarily forgot-
ten that we are in the midst of a global 
pandemic, the Senate has not forgotten 
that. We will continue to monitor the 
progress of businessowners as they 
slowly repair the damage done to our 
economy by extended lockdowns and do 
everything we can to make sure our 
scientists have the resources they need 
to develop a vaccine for COVID–19. 
Our relationship with China has 
changed forever, and we must pass leg-
islation to reflect that. Our supply 
chains that provide pharmaceuticals, 
medical supplies, and critical national 
resources are all vulnerable to manipu-
lation by Beijing. We should pass legis-
lation to incentivize domestic manu-
facturing, starting with the SAM-C bill 
that Senator MENENDEZ and I have of-
fered in this Chamber. This would sup-
port stateside pharmaceutical produc-
tion. 
We must also continue working with 
Big Tech to create responsible privacy 
guidelines and protect consumer data 
from Chinese hackers. Last week in Ju-
diciary, we heard testimony that con-
firmed a history of corruption at the 
highest levels of the Obama-led Justice 
Department. There are many, even in 
this Chamber, who would rather not 
talk about that, but we must press for-
ward with this investigation. We have 
to get to the bottom of what happened 
at the Department of Justice and with 
the FBI during Operation Crossfire 
Hurricane, and we will do all of this. 
We will do the job that we were elected 
to do while we maintain law and order 
and insist that those enforcing the law 
are accountable to the citizens whom 
they are sworn to serve and protect. 
To those who insist that we as a na-
tion are irreparably broken, I want you 
to know that I and the American peo-
ple have taken note of your words, and 
now I hope that you will take note of 
mine. This country is strong. Our peo-
ple are resilient. Over the course of 
just a few months, many of them have 
lost everything. They have lost the 
lives of family members. They have 
lost their livelihoods. Their lives and 
their futures—every waking moment of 
every day—are filled with uncertainty, 
but they still hold tight to those les-
sons they learned when they were chil-
dren. They know that they were en-
dowed by their Creator with the lib-
erties that make America special and 
that no force on Earth has the power to 
separate them from their faith in God 
and their country and in one another. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Washington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2755 
June 8, 2020 
called the Great American Outdoors 
Act. I urge all of my colleagues to sup-
port this important legislation. 
First, I thank everyone who has been 
involved in this legislation—Senator 
GARDNER, who just joined us on the 
floor; Senator MANCHIN, who spoke ear-
lier; Senator DAINES; Senator WARNER; 
Senator PORTMAN, who also spoke ear-
lier; 
Senator 
ALEXANDER; 
Senator 
KING; Senator BURR; and then several 
other Senators who will, I know, par-
ticipate tomorrow as a group and 
speak—Senators 
TESTER, 
BENNET, 
HEINRICH, and so many more. 
This coalition has said we should 
spend the money in the fund for LWCF 
and combine it with taking care of 
parks’ backlog. This has been a pri-
ority of two different groups of Sen-
ators who have worked together to try 
to pass this legislation. 
I also thank Senators PORTMAN, 
ALEXANDER, KING, and WARNER and my 
House colleague, Representative KIL-
MER, for working so diligently on the 
parks’ backlog. I thank Senator ALEX-
ANDER specifically, who has been one of 
the champions of the parks’ backlog. 
Just a few years ago, I remember I 
asked him: LAMAR, do you think we are 
really going to get $6.5 billion spent on 
the backlog? 
He said: We are going to try our 
darned best. 
Apparently, 
LAMAR
ALEXANDER’s 
darned best today has been a success in 
helping us to move this forward. 
Again, I thank the prime sponsors of 
the bill, Senator GARDNER and Senator 
MANCHIN, for their steadfast work on 
the LWCF and the parks’ backlog. I 
also thank Senator BURR, who is a 
steadfast champion of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, and who, 
with me, helped to sponsor the perma-
nent reauthorization of the Fund and 
tried to get the funds spent. This effort 
has continued over many decades by 
many colleagues, including by two 
former Senators, Bingaman and Bau-
cus, who were both giants in all of this. 
I thank everybody for their impor-
tant efforts over the years that have 
gotten us to this point today. 
Why are we here? A lot of people 
would ask: In the middle of a pan-
demic, an economic crisis, and a big 
struggle to energize the need for civil 
rights and equality, why are we talking 
about a public lands bill? 
As I said, we are here because there 
is a lot of history behind the outdoors 
economy and the economy itself of the 
activities that generate an economic 
return from having public lands. This 
has been a juggernaut for us. There is 
$887 billion in consumer spending every 
year, and that helps to support about 
7.6 million jobs. 
While some are probably asking, 
‘‘How did we get so lucky to have this 
coalition of bipartisan Senators come 
together with regard public lands and 
public land investment, and why can’t 
we take that same magic and make it 
happen in other places?’’ I encourage 
my colleagues not only to get this leg-
islation done and think about how we 
did get it done together but also to 
think about how special public lands 
are for the United States of America. 
Public lands are part of our history. 
They are part of what we have invested 
in on behalf of the citizens of the 
United States so you have a place to 
recreate, to hunt, to fish, to find sol-
ace, to find recovery, to find enjoy-
ment, to find amazement when you see 
the wonderful places, particularly in 
the State of Washington. 
Because the LWCF is paid for by roy-
alties from oil companies that drill off 
our shores, these investments don’t 
cost the taxpayers a dime or add to our 
deficit. This bill will be injecting 
money into our economy, creating 
more jobs, and fixing the repairs that 
we need to our lands and lands infra-
structure. 
Over the last half a century, the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund has 
supported over 42,000 State and local 
projects, and it has included an invest-
ment of $725 million in the State of 
Washington. It has helped us to expand 
access to clean rivers, hunting lands, 
forestlands, and to improve our na-
tional parks. It has been a critical pro-
tection tool for heritage areas and for 
augmenting wildlife refuges across our 
State. In fact, the LWCF fund has sup-
ported 98 percent of the parks in coun-
ties across the United States of Amer-
ica. At one point in time, 98 percent of 
the counties across this country have 
used the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
In the State of Washington, it has 
helped us to establish iconic places like 
Gas Works Park; Bidwell Park, which 
is near Spokane; the Burnt Bridge 
Creek Trail, which winds through Van-
couver; and the Warren G. Magnuson 
Park at Sand Point, which has been 
used for valuable conservation ease-
ments and to help popular forest legacy 
programs that partner with timber 
owners to promote sustainable for-
estry. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
has helped us to make a decision that 
has been long debated and long dis-
puted. David Brooks, from the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources, could tell you how many times 
we have had to debate both the backlog 
and the LWCF issues and how people 
have wanted to spend those dollars. It 
has been a very, very challenging issue 
for years. 
Besides saying that we are going to 
take money and put it forward to per-
manently fund the LWCF, the bill also 
says that we are going to tackle the 
backlog and maintenance. I mentioned 
the $6.5 billion infusion for that main-
tenance. For us in the State of Wash-
ington, with our many national parks, 
there is $262 million for deferred main-
tenance costs to include repairs to the 
water treatment system at Olympic 
National Park. It could help us with 
$186 million in deferred maintenance at 
Mount Rainier. It could help us with 
miles of trails and access to camp-
grounds. It could also help us in the 
very important area of expanding ac-
cess. 
There are other projects in the State 
of Washington, and sometimes, when 
we don’t take care of our backlog and 
maintenance, we don’t get the dollars 
because they go to the larger parks. So 
this will help us to make sure we don’t 
ignore that crumbling infrastructure 
or the deteriorating hiking trails or 
the aging visitors centers. It will help 
us with projects like the $28 million 
needed for the Lake Roosevelt National 
Recreation Area, the $2.6 million for 
the Whitman Mission National Historic 
Site, the $43 million that is needed for 
the Fort Vancouver National Historic 
Site in southwest Washington, the $18 
million for the North Cascades Na-
tional Park in Washington, and the $5 
million for the San Juan Island Na-
tional Historic Park in the northern 
part of our State. 
As you can see, the State of Wash-
ington is definitely in the outdoor in-
dustry business. We have been very 
blessed with a beautiful environment, 
and we have been very blessed with an 
economy that has been based on those 
beautiful outdoors. So we are very 
happy today that our colleagues have 
joined in this bipartisan effort to say 
that public lands really do mean a lot 
to our Nation and that they deserve an 
upgrade—a 
facelift—an 
investment, 
and a commitment to keep funding the 
things that will allow us to expand 
public access to them. 
It is the legislation that we need to 
pass even in this unbelievable time of 
so many other critical issues. I believe 
now, more than ever, our local parks 
and our urban green space can give sol-
ace to Americans who need refuge from 
all of the issues we are dealing with. 
Now, more than ever, we need to pro-
mote access to the shared public lands 
so that every American can get access, 
and the American people have had an 
incredibly difficult several few months. 
Let’s give them something to think 
about for their futures—access to the 
great outdoors, which will help all of 
us in the future. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I 
thank the Senator from Washington 
for her leadership on our great public 
lands and the bill, the Great American 
Outdoors Act, that we will be voting on 
this week and debating into next week. 
What an historic occasion for the U.S. 
Senate. We don’t often have the chance 
to make history. This week, we do. So 
thank you to the Senator from Wash-
ington. 
June is, of course, the Great Out-
doors Month. Since 1998, when Presi-
dent Clinton started with 1 week of the 
Great Outdoors Week, it has since ex-
panded and has been observed every 
year, 
beginning 
with 
those 
Great 
American Outdoors Weeks in 1998 to 
the entire month of June celebrating 
that we do today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2756 
June 8, 2020 
This week, we are debating landmark 
legislation, the Great American Out-
doors Act, that brings two ideas to-
gether that have been worked on by so 
many of my colleagues in this Chamber 
for so long. 
I introduced this legislation with 
Senator MANCHIN, along with so many 
other bipartisan champions for the out-
doors and our great public lands and 
spaces. The Great American Outdoors 
Act combines $1.9 billion a year for 5 
years for deferred maintenance at the 
National Park Service, the U.S. Forest 
Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, 
the 
Bureau 
of 
Land 
Management, 
which is now headquartered in Grand 
Junction, CO, and the Bureau of Indian 
Education schools, and permanent an-
nual funding of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, the crown jewel of 
our conservation programs, at $900 mil-
lion per year. 
Let’s revisit how we arrived at this 
historic moment. Last year, the Senate 
came together, in bipartisan fashion, 
and passed the most significant con-
servation measure in over a decade. 
The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, 
Management, 
and 
Recreation 
Act, 
among other things, included the per-
manent authorization of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. 
Congress had established the LWCF 
in 1965, with the idea of using revenue 
generated from offshore energy devel-
opment to fund improvements on pub-
lic lands at no cost to the taxpayer. I 
repeat that again—at no cost to the 
taxpayer. The LWCF has increased ac-
cess for Americans everywhere to hunt, 
fish, camp, and enjoy recreation activi-
ties on their public lands, the lands we 
own and hold as a country. 
It has protected and expanded access 
for conservation in all 50 States, the 
territories, and in nearly every county. 
LWCF is the crown jewel, as I said, of 
our Nation’s conservation programs, 
and it has broad bipartisan support. 
Yet, for decades, short-term authoriza-
tions and uncertain funding levels 
hampered the ability of the conserva-
tion community to come up with the 
long-term plans that we need to pro-
tect our most cherished landscapes. 
The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conserva-
tion, Management, and Recreation Act 
took care of one of those problems. We 
actually managed to solve a problem, 
but it was just half of the picture. The 
permanent reauthorization of the pro-
gram guaranteed the full $900 million 
authorization would be set aside every 
year going forward. We won that fight. 
Together, we passed that legislation. 
However, the fight for fully funding 
the program continued. While I am ap-
preciative of the ever-increasing levels 
of funding we have successfully fought 
to secure—in fact, we have seen some 
of the highest funding over the last 
year or 2 years than we have seen in 
over 15 years that we have successfully 
fought to secure in the Senate—it is 
still not what was agreed to. It is still 
not what was agreed to when this pro-
gram was created in 1965. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
fixes this issue. It guarantees that the 
full $900 million that is sent in to the 
LWCF trust fund are spent every year 
and not diverted for other purposes. I 
would like to share some of the land-
scapes in my home State that LWCF 
has preserved for the public and for 
generations to come. 
You can see this picture, this incred-
ible, awesome, majestic landscape of 
the Great Sand Dunes National Park 
and Preserve. It is located in the ap-
proximately 122-mile-long San Luis 
Valley in Southeast Colorado. The 
dunes in the park are the tallest found 
anywhere in North America, and right 
now people are visiting to experience 
the seasonal flow of Medano Creek, 
which forms in front of the dunes as 
snow melts in the spring and early 
summer. It is the closest thing that we 
see to beachfront property every spring 
at the sand dunes. 
As you can imagine, the ecosystem in 
this area is incredibly delicate. You 
see, the sand dunes are here because of 
basically the hydrostatic charge that is 
created from the groundwater when it 
comes to the sand particles. It is that 
water that forms around the sand that 
holds the sand dunes in place. Without 
the water underneath it, the sand 
dunes just blow away, and they are not 
there. 
The sand dunes sit next to what are 
some of the most important wetlands 
in the State of Colorado. LWCF funds 
were used to protect those wetlands 
and to facilitate a transfer to an exist-
ing refuge, while also helping to pro-
tect the dunes. LWCF was able to pro-
tect the land that protected the water 
that keeps the dunes in place. 
In northwestern Colorado—we go to 
the next picture—a ranch sits along 
the banks of the Yampa River, which 
flows into Cross Mountain Canyon, 
then downstream to Dinosaur National 
Monument. If you have ever been to Di-
nosaur National Monument, you know 
what an incredible treasure that is. It 
straddles the States of Colorado and 
Utah. The Cross Mountain Canyon run 
is one of the best white-water rafting 
trips in the State, and if it is one of the 
best white-water rafting trips in the 
State, you can guarantee that it makes 
it one of the best in the country be-
cause of what we have to offer in Colo-
rado. There is also a very healthy elk 
population that facilitates seasonal 
hunting, and obviously the fishing is 
great as well. 
Throughout this area of public land— 
through both the monument and lands 
under the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment—and private land, access to our 
public lands is difficult for those who 
travel to this area of Colorado from all 
over the world to hunt, to fish, to raft, 
and more. 
With a small amount of LWCF fund-
ing through the Forest Legacy Pro-
gram, which we also fund through 
LWCF, the ranch on the banks of the 
Yampa River was able to enter a con-
servation easement. This protected and 
enhanced access to tens of thousands of 
surrounding acres of Federal lands. 
You see, we not only have the oppor-
tunity to continue protecting our pub-
lic lands, but there are public lands 
that we don’t have access to because 
you can’t get to it. So utilizing a pro-
gram like the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund helps the American 
people have access to what they al-
ready hold. 
In southwest Colorado, we go to an-
other successful Forest Legacy Pro-
gram project that protects vital wild-
life habitat and a watershed that pro-
vides water to thousands of people. The 
Sawtooth Ranch is visible from the 
San Juan Skyway, one of the most 
spectacular places on God’s Earth—one 
of 31 designated scenic All-American 
roads. It is also visible from Mount 
Sneffels, one of Colorado’s famous 
fourteeners. 
Outdoor recreation of every kind 
takes place in the area next to the 
ranch to support the local economy, 
and the protection of the ranch has 
helped facilitate even greater opportu-
nities. 
Federal lands like the ones I have 
shown you are incredibly popular des-
tinations for tourists from all over the 
world, as well as recreational enthu-
siasts. In 2018, Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park was the third most visited 
national park in the country. 
There were 4.9 million people that 
visited the park last year, setting a 
new record. Just decades prior to 2009— 
think about this—that was 4.9 million 
people in just the last year. In 2009, 
that visitation number was only 2.8 
million a year. 
The explosion of visitation numbers 
is not contained just to the lands main-
tained by the National Park Service. 
The entire Federal land system is sup-
porting a recreation economy that has 
become a major economic powerhouse 
because as more people go to places 
like Sawtooth Ranch and as more peo-
ple go to places like Rocky National 
Park, they are pushed out to other 
areas of Arapaho and Roosevelt Na-
tional Forests. They are pushed out to 
the north sand dune, the BLM land, 
and more use and more use and more 
opportunity. 
But the Federal investment and in-
frastructure that supports these great 
landscapes and the recreation econo-
mies they facilitate has not kept pace, 
and we know that it has not kept pace 
with the use of the lands. In Colorado, 
that translates to the third most vis-
ited national park in the country, 
which saw 4.9 million visitors last year, 
having an $84 million maintenance 
backlog. In total, Colorado’s units 
managed by the National Park System 
have a $247 million backlog of deferred 
maintenance needs. 
The Forest Service in Colorado has 
an astonishing $325 million mainte-
nance backlog. When you think about 
that pattern repeated on Federal lands 
and in our parks across 49 other States,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2757 
June 8, 2020 
you begin to understand how we ar-
rived at a systemwide $20 billion back-
log. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will provide an annual funding level of 
$1.9 billion over the next 5 years to a 
restoration fund, for which money can 
be used solely for those deferred main-
tenance projects, and this is all paid 
for. It is all paid for by revenues associ-
ated with onshore and offshore energy 
development. This will allow the land 
management agencies to address the 
highest priority projects to bring our 
outdoor recreation economy into the 
21st century for the enjoyment of the 
22nd, the 23rd, and the 24th centuries of 
this great Nation. 
And the 21st century, of course, is 
where it needs to be and where we 
start. According to the Bureau of Eco-
nomic 
Analysis, 
hunting, 
fishing, 
camping, hiking, paddling, and other 
outdoor 
recreation 
activities 
con-
tribute to a total of $778 billion annu-
ally to the economy and support 5.2 
million American jobs. 
This sector accounts for 2.2 percent 
of the U.S. gross domestic product. 
Each year our Federal public lands 
contribute nearly $60 billion to the 
American economy and support more 
than 400,000 jobs. Now is the time to in-
vest in our recreation infrastructure. 
Now is the time to invest in this job 
opportunity. 
You know, prior to the pandemic, we 
were living in the midst of one of the 
greatest economies the world has ever 
seen. Unemployment was at record 
lows, wages were growing, and people 
were spending their hard-earned dollars 
in our communities supporting local 
economies, fishing, hiking, enjoying 
the great outdoors after spending 3 
months in the great indoors. Our 
mountain towns and gateway commu-
nities were hit hard by COVID–19. That 
first wave decimated economies in our 
Western Slope of Colorado. The ski sea-
son ended early. Restaurants closed 
and hotels emptied. The jobs that are 
created and sustained by this bill, as 
we recover from the pandemic, will be 
a vital component of our overall eco-
nomic recovery as Americans get back 
to work and back to playing after they 
have worked so hard—working hard 
and playing hard—two great American 
values. 
As we have this vote tonight on clo-
ture, I hope my colleagues will support 
this motion to support our public lands 
and the communities that sustain 
them by supporting the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act. 
I will leave it with this. Enos Mills, 
one of the fathers of Rocky Mountain 
National Park, once said this about our 
public lands: 
The trail compels you to know your-
self and to be yourself, and puts you in 
harmony with the universe. It makes 
you glad to be living. It gives health, 
hope, and courage, and it extends that 
touch of nature which tends to make 
you kind. 
I can think of no better piece of legis-
lation on our public lands than to work 
our way to find a little bit more kind-
ness, a little bit more hope, a little bit 
more strength, and a great deal of op-
portunity. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I 
thank you for the recognition, and I 
thank Senator GARDNER for his hard 
work on this excellent piece of legisla-
tion. 
Today, our Nation is in pain. It is the 
pain of centuries of deeply embedded 
racial 
injustice. 
This 
Nation 
has 
watched in horror as the last 8 minutes 
and 46 seconds of George Floyd’s life 
were cruelly and needlessly taken from 
him by a police officer. 
Our Nation grieves for the families of 
Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and 
so many other innocent Black men and 
women violently taken from their fam-
ilies and loved ones. This is a pain all 
too familiar for too many Black Amer-
icans. This is a moment of reckoning 
for our Nation. 
Black Americans have borne the 
brunt of this systemic racism, as have 
Hispanic and Native American commu-
nities in New Mexico and across the 
Nation. 
So many of our officers protect and 
serve with honor and integrity, but we 
cannot continue to sweep police bru-
tality and racial inequality under the 
rug, ignoring these painful legacies 
until the next tragedy. There are thou-
sands of Americans of every political 
stripe across the Nation who have 
come out in peaceful protest demand-
ing change. 
Now, we know there are a few—a very 
small few—who are exploiting our Na-
tion’s pain and using violence to dis-
rupt. We unequivocally condemn all 
acts of violence and call for nonviolent 
but urgent action. By calling for the 
U.S. military to quell protests, as the 
President and some in this body have 
done, that crosses a line between civil-
ian and military rule that is antithet-
ical to American traditions. Instead of 
calling for American soldiers to repress 
their fellow citizens exercising their 
First Amendment rights, I am calling 
for action from this body. 
Today, Senators BOOKER and HARRIS 
introduced the Justice in Policing Act, 
a bill I am proud to cosponsor. This 
landmark bill holds police misconduct 
accountable in courts of law. It shines 
a light on police practices, requiring 
transparency, and ends racial profiling 
and mandates racial bias training. It 
bans choke holds and requires body 
cams and makes lynching a Federal 
crime. 
This is a moment of reckoning for 
our Nation. I call upon the Senate ma-
jority to join with us to pass this long 
overdue legislation as soon as possible. 
H.R. 1957 
Madam President, I now turn to the 
bill before us, the Great American Out-
doors Act. Our country’s public lands 
are at the very core of our national 
identity. They protect our national 
heritage, our lands, waters, and our 
wildlife for future generations. Our na-
tional parks, monuments, and wildlife 
refuges are irreplaceable treasures— 
sources of beauty, of solitude, recre-
ation, and of renewal. 
From the Grand Canyon to Stonewall 
National Monument to the city park in 
our neighborhood, our public lands sus-
tain our people, and we owe it to these 
special places and to ourselves and to 
our children to sustain them for the fu-
ture. 
Today, I stand here in strong support 
of the Great American Outdoors Act, 
legislation that at long last fully and 
permanently funds the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund and invests in our 
public lands for the future. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund was passed in 1964. My father, 
Stewart Udall, was Secretary of the 
Department of the Interior at the time, 
and I am proud he helped establish the 
LWCF. As Secretary, he was troubled 
by how difficult it was to expand public 
lands. At that time, the Federal Gov-
ernment would redesignate existing 
Federal lands to create a new national 
park or a new wildlife refuge or rely on 
private donations to expand, but the 
Congress itself resisted appropriating 
funds to create new public lands. 
At a wilderness conference in 1963, 
my father bluntly said: ‘‘[T]he path of 
land conservation that our government 
has used for more than half a century 
is running into a dead end.’’ 
But he had conceived of a new path 
forward, ‘‘an entirely new watershed in 
the history of the conservation move-
ment in the United States,’’ he told 
them. Just 3 weeks before the con-
ference, President Kennedy had sent 
Congress a new piece of legislation 
called the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund Act. My father and others 
conceived of a Federal fund that would 
both generate money to acquire new 
Federal lands and provide States with 
funding to expand recreational oppor-
tunities. The bill passed Congress the 
next year. 
The LWCF has been called our Na-
tion’s most successful conservation 
program. It is wildly popular with the 
American people, and it has touched 
every corner of our Nation—in rural 
and urban areas with parks, forests, 
wildlife refuges, trails, wild and scenic 
river corridors, historic monuments, 
and cultural sites. LWCF has funded 
42,000 stateside projects. In my home 
State alone, it has helped over 1,200 
such projects found in every 1 of our 33 
counties. 
After the LWCF was enacted, it be-
came clear that the initial funding 
sources were too limited. My father 
persuaded President Johnson to sup-
port using Federal revenues from oil 
and gas leases in the Outer Continental 
Shelf to fund the program. His plan 
converted revenue from a nonrenew-
able source into a permanent protec-
tion for our renewable natural world. 
While Congress amended the act to 
include this funding source and later

authorized the fund to actually annu-
ally accrue $900 million, the full prom-
ise of LWCF was not yet fulfilled. 
Throughout my career, I have cham-
pioned increases to the LWCF, but it 
deserves the dedicated funding my fa-
ther and many others envisioned. Last 
year, Congress finally permanently au-
thorized the fund, a historic victory for 
conservation. 
It is long past time we take the next 
step and permanently direct the full 
$900 million to the fund every year. Not 
only has the LWCF met its conserva-
tion mission 100 times over; it has 
helped fuel the outdoor recreation 
economy and support local economies, 
especially in rural areas throughout 
the Nation. 
Since the creation of the fund, the 
outdoor industry has grown tremen-
dously. It is now an $887 billion indus-
try that powers 7.6 million jobs. That 
includes nearly 100,000 direct jobs in 
New Mexico, driving $2.8 billion in 
wages and nearly $10 billion in con-
sumer spending. 
Fully 
and 
permanently 
funding 
LWCF will translate directly into eco-
nomic growth. We need to energize our 
economy now more than ever as we 
work our way out of the financial crisis 
created by COVID–19. 
Throughout our history, we have 
seen investing in public lands energizes 
both our economy and our national 
spirit. Conservation must be a center-
piece of our recovery at this chal-
lenging time for our Nation. 
Indeed, the economic benefits of the 
LWCF are great, but the human bene-
fits to ourselves, our families, and our 
communities may be greater. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
recent 
LWCF 
projects in New Mexico is the Valle de 
Oro National Wildlife Refuge, the first 
urban wildlife refuge in the Southwest. 
Here is a photograph of our State’s 
newest refuge: Valle de Oro. The Rio 
Grande runs along this refuge, which 
boasts an amazing array of wild birds, 
including sandhill cranes—which you 
see here—the greater roadrunner, and 
the American kestrel. The $6 million 
contribution from the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund helped make the vi-
sion of this urban oasis a reality. 
Valle de Oro is special to me because 
it introduces young people—often His-
panic young people with limited means 
and limited access to nature—to their 
first outdoor experience. It introduces 
kids to a world of wonder and a life-
time of connection to nature. And it is 
just down the street. 
As Richard Louv discussed so elo-
quently in his seminal book ‘‘Last 
Child in the Woods’’ and backed up 
with peer-reviewed study after study, 
our children need nature, and we suffer 
spiritually and physically when that 
bond is lost. 
So as we take this historic action to 
add to our national heritage, I am glad 
we are also addressing the $19 billion 
worth of deferred maintenance on our 
existing public lands. Like the other 
days 
of 
the 
Civilian 
Conservation 
Corps, this work is especially timely 
and will help our economic recovery at 
a time of historic unemployment. 
It is good news that use of our public 
lands has increased so dramatically 
over time. More than 1 billion visitors 
enjoy our Federal public lands each 
year. The infrastructure on these pub-
lic 
lands—our 
roads, 
bridges, 
and 
trails; our campgrounds, marinas; and 
our drinking water and sewer sys-
tems—are wearing out. Historic build-
ings are falling apart. Trails are 
washed out. Roads and bridges can’t be 
used. Water lines and sewer systems 
don’t function. The list is long—$19 bil-
lion long. 
In New Mexico alone, we have $121 
million worth of deferred maintenance 
needed at iconic places like Carlsbad 
Caverns, White Sands National Park, 
Chaco 
Culture 
National 
Historical 
Park, the Gila Cliff Dwellings, and 
Bandelier National Monument. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
represents a substantial downpayment 
toward maintaining, repairing, and 
renovating the infrastructure on our 
public lands—allocating up to $1.9 bil-
lion annually for 5 years. This rep-
resents Congress’s most significant 
commitment to date to the long-term 
future of our public lands. 
The American people own these pre-
cious resources. We need to maintain 
the American people’s public spaces so 
that all of us can continue to safely 
and 
enjoyably 
visit 
these 
special 
places. How we take care of these pub-
lic places says a lot about our Nation. 
Our Nation’s conservation heritage is 
uniquely American. The bill before us 
strengthens our Nation’s commitment 
to conservation, to protecting our wild 
places, to preserving our history and 
cultures, and to nurturing our bonds 
with nature and the great outdoors. 
I urge every Member here to whole-
heartedly support our heritage and 
vote in favor of this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
finish my remarks prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today we 
have the opportunity to make history 
in the U.S. Senate. Together, we can 
move forward with passing one of the 
most important conservation bills in 
decades. 
In fact, standing here today, I can 
tell you something. There are not 
many issues that bring Republicans 
and Democrats together, but some-
thing actually does that, and that is 
protecting our public lands. 
If you remember, about a year and a 
half ago, we passed a major bipartisan 
lands package where we permanently 
authorized a conservation program— 
something we are here to talk about 
today—and that is the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. 
Today we have the opportunity to 
move forward on this bipartisan Great 
American Outdoors Act, a conservation 
bill that will provide full and perma-
nent funding for the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund and finally tackle 
this massive maintenance backlog that 
is plaguing our public lands, including 
our national parks. 
How we got here today isn’t by 
chance. In fact, on February 27, I sat 
down with my colleague Senator CORY 
GARDNER of Colorado, Leader MCCON-
NELL, and President Trump in the 
White House—we were in the Roosevelt 
room, in fact—to pitch a simple idea: 
Let’s set aside political gridlock, and 
let’s pass the most important conserva-
tion law in decades. 
In fact, I showed the President of the 
United States, President Trump, pic-
tures of land and water conservation 
projects in Montana—the Tenderfoot 
Creek and the Falls Creek projects— 
and we talked about the importance of 
this program in places like Montana. 
As a fifth-generation Montanan, I 
know just how important our public 
lands are to protecting and preserving 
our Montana way of life, from fishing 
on the Yellowstone River to summiting 
Granite Peak, which I did back in col-
lege—in fact, the week after that, I 
summited the Grand Teton down in 
Wyoming—or backpacking in The Bar-
racks, which we do virtually every 
summer. I have enjoyed our great out-
doors, and this is an appreciation and 
something that Cindy and I have 
passed on to our four children. In fact, 
I proposed to my sweet wife Cindy on 
top of Hyalite Peak, a peak over 10,000 
feet just south of Bozeman, in July of 
1986. 
Montana is a place where you can 
still go down to Walmart and buy an 
elk tag or deer tag over the counter 
and, literally, within minutes have ac-
cess to our public lands to hunt and 
fish. 
As Montana’s voice in the U.S. Sen-
ate, I have made it one of my highest 
priorities to protect and expand access 
to our public lands, and the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund is a critical 
tool for accomplishing that. 
Think about this for a moment: Over 
70 percent of the fishing accesses across 
Montana are funded through this con-
servation program. Sportsmen, con-
servationists, and outdoor enthusiasts 
will agree that this program is critical 
for conservation and important for pro-
tecting our great outdoor heritage and 
our Montana way of life. 
This conservation program is impor-
tant for creating and protecting jobs 
for our outdoor economy. This program 
is also an important tool for land man-
agers and agencies to address the 
checkerboard land ownership. We see 
that 
in 
Montana. 
Addressing 
that 
checkerboard ownership makes a lot of 
sense. 
You see, over 11⁄2 million acres of 
Federal land in our State sit entirely 
landlocked. In many cases, specific 
land and water conservation projects in 
Montana will help consolidate land

ownership that can make overall land-
scape management less complicated 
and easier for agencies. 
In fact, the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund was passed with the in-
tent to be funded at $900 million per 
year, and, every single year, $900 mil-
lion plus goes into that trust account, 
but nowhere close to that level of fund-
ing is actually appropriated. 
In reality, if Congress wanted to, 
they don’t have to fund the program at 
all. In fact, only twice—going back to 
1965—has it been funded at the $900 mil-
lion mark. What we see each year is 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
gets raided by Congress, and millions 
of dollars are spent on other programs. 
Mandatory funding would create cer-
tainty for land managers that the full 
$900 million goes toward that program 
every year moving forward. 
Now, we must also support and pre-
serve our country’s beloved national 
parks. Our national parks are what set 
us apart from the rest of the world. I 
like to think of them as our office of 
first impressions, and we need to do a 
better job taking care of them, be bet-
ter stewards. 
With record visitations and increased 
visitation each year, park infrastruc-
ture has inevitably experienced wear 
and tear, and this has led to a signifi-
cant 
maintenance 
backlog. 
Today, 
there is nearly $12 billion in mainte-
nance backlog facing our national 
parks across the Nation, including $700 
million in Glacier and Yellowstone Na-
tional Parks and an additional $34 mil-
lion throughout the State in places 
like Little Bighorn Battlefield and the 
Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Park. 
The bill also addresses the backlog in 
our Forest Service, BLM, and Fish and 
Wildlife Service lands. In Montana, our 
forests are critical for outdoor recre-
ation as well as our wood products in-
dustry. It makes sense that we protect 
and maintain access to these lands for 
future generations because the wonders 
of our public lands are unique to any 
other country in the world. 
Montanans were brought up with a 
love of the outdoors and a sense of re-
sponsibility to conserve as well as 
maintain them. To us, protecting our 
public lands is about preserving the 
way of life unique to our western fron-
tier heritage. 
It is an honor to serve the people of 
Montana in the U.S. Senate and to 
bring this vote—a vote decades in the 
making—before the U.S. Senate today. 
I urge my Senate colleagues to stand 
with me to pass this bipartisan Great 
American Outdoors Act. 
I am ready to get this done for Mon-
tana. Future generations are counting 
on our vote today, and I believe, truly, 
it is a conservative principle to con-
serve. The Founders’ vision for Amer-
ica was a frontier nation, a wild na-
tion. 
What made America distinct from in-
dustrial Europe and all the other coun-
tries in the world was our outdoors, 
for, of course, what is America without 
Lewis and Clark? 
I will leave you with this last 
thought from Teddy Roosevelt. This 
was in the context of thinking about 
our national parks and our public 
lands: ‘‘We have fallen heirs to the 
most glorious heritage a people ever 
received, and each one must do his part 
if we wish to show that the nation is 
worthy of its good fortune.’’ 
I yield the floor.

PROTESTS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, a 
week ago, I did a television interview 
on race relations in America. They 
asked me to talk a little bit about 
what happened in Tulsa in 1921. 
The worst race massacre in American 
history occurred in Tulsa in 1921. It 
was May 31, overnight, into June 1. I 
was on television a week ago, describ-
ing the event of how a group of White 
rioters had marched into Greenwood— 
what was called Black Wall Street— 
and had killed up to 300 people there. 
They had set Greenwood on fire, de-
stroying homes and businesses. 
Many people at home don’t know 
this, but everyone in this Chamber 
does. As I was talking, I was just talk-
ing to a camera lens and couldn’t tell 
what was on TV at the time. There 
were pictures of a town in the United 
States that was currently on fire while 
I was describing a race massacre that 
had happened 99 years ago that week-
end. 
We have come a long way with the 
issue of race in America, but we clearly 
have a very long way to go. We have 
four centuries of racial inequality 
stacked on top of each other. While we 
break through those things step by 
step, we have things that we can do. I 
have been on the phone for days with 
friends and with people whom I know 
from all over Oklahoma—from all 
backgrounds—and have been talking 
about race relationships and where we 
go as a nation. Some people throw up 
their hands and say: I don’t know what 
to do. Many people have an idea, but 
everyone wants the situation to get 
better. 
What is interesting is the dialogue 
about protesters and rioters and police 
officers. I share openly with them that 
I don’t judge protesters and rioters the 
same. Some people do. They throw 
them all into one big group. I do not. 
There are people out standing on the 
streets who just want to be heard, who 
finally just want things in America to 
change, for America to fulfill her 
promise of equal justice under the law 
in every area, in every community. 
They are peaceful. They are sometimes

loud and brash, but they are frustrated, 
and they want to be heard. There is an-
other group that breaks through the 
middle of those protesters. These in 
this group smash windows, steal shoes 
and electronics from stores, and spray 
paint and destroy public property just 
from their own anger. 
I don’t treat protesters and rioters 
the same, and I encourage people not 
to treat all police officers the same. 
Are there some rioters mixed in with 
the protesters? Yes. Are there some po-
lice officers who need to be confronted 
for their racial views? Yes. Is that all 
of them? By far, no. Every person 
should be judged by his own char-
acter—every person. When we as Amer-
icans lump groups together and say 
they are like that, we have divided us 
even more. 
It was 20 years ago when my State 
made it illegal for a police officer to 
stop someone simply because of one’s 
race. Most police departments in Okla-
homa don’t allow a choke hold. In fact, 
I spoke with officers in the Oklahoma 
City Police Department who have been 
there for a very long time who said 
they were never even trained to do 
that. They were told not to do that. 
What has happened in other areas and 
other places has not happened in my 
State in the same way, but I still have 
friends of mine who are African Amer-
ican who still catch me and tell me the 
numbers of times they have been pulled 
over for driving while Black in places 
and neighborhoods in which I have 
never been pulled over but in which 
they have been multiple times. 
We still have a long way to go. This 
legislative body can talk about it—we 
can share empathy, and we can listen— 
but we are also called to act. 
So I bring to this body just a few 
ideas, some things we can do to engage, 
things like greater transparency. How 
can we oppose just getting information 
out? 
There are simple things that we are 
not currently doing, like gathering a 
Federal database on the use of lethal 
force by law enforcement. All of that 
data of whatever police department in 
whatever place that uses lethal force 
should be collected and sent to a Fed-
eral database so there can be a na-
tional tracking of where lethal force is 
used. What race is the police officer? 
What is the race of the person on whom 
lethal force was used? What was the 
situation? How was the investigation 
handled? What was the result of that 
investigation? These are basic details. 
City councils, city leaders, and city 
managers should not be afraid to look 
at the data and ask hard questions. We 
should not be afraid to look at the data 
and ask hard questions. 
Most every community has oversight 
boards that are citizen boards. Good. 
Are they empowered to actually en-
gage? Are they involved in the hiring 
process? Are they involved in the over-
sight? Do they get a chance to look 
over their shoulders to evaluate what 
happens? Do they know when there are 
reports on the same law enforcement 
officer over and over again? Are those 
advisory panels empowered? 
Are there body cameras? It is not 
just if there are body cameras, but are 
they on? This has been our second chal-
lenge. Getting body cameras is just 
transparency. It is just the availability 
of information so that law enforcement 
can see and so that citizens can see 
what is happening. Law enforcement is 
in very, very difficult situations every 
single day. When law enforcement offi-
cers leave their homes each morning, 
their families give them hugs and hope 
they come home that night because, 
every day, they face challenges. I have 
great compassion for those folks. Body 
cameras help everybody, for they pro-
vide clarity as to what is going on, but 
they are not effective if they are not 
on, and we have had several situations 
lately in which it seems, conveniently, 
body cameras have not been on. That is 
a problem, and it is an area we should 
address. 
Mental health training is an area 
that has come up over and over again 
and not just recently. This has come up 
for a long time. This body—the Sen-
ate—and the House have passed and the 
President has signed additional legisla-
tion dealing with mental health issues, 
but States and local areas have to en-
gage in this as well. Even in my own 
State, law enforcement is responsible 
for transporting an individual across 
the State to a treatment facility for 
mental health or for treatment for sub-
stance abuse. My State really does 
need to determine a better, more com-
passionate way to transport someone 
with mental illness or substance abuse 
rather than in the back seat of a police 
car. 
We have to have a better, more com-
passionate way to do that. Every time 
this occurs, law enforcement officers 
are taken off the streets for an entire 
day because they are transporting 
someone when someone else could have 
done that in a more compassionate, 
less obvious way than in the back of a 
police car. We have to find a better way 
to do that. Every time our law enforce-
ment folks transition across the State, 
they lose the time they could have 
used for training, for getting out of 
their cars to meet neighbors and hear 
stories, for earning trust, and for heal-
ing relationships. 
Every city of any size across America 
has boards and commissions, but those 
boards and commissions often have the 
same people who just shuffle around 
from the same boards and commis-
sions. They get off one board and move 
to another board. I find, just by asking 
around, that many of those on boards 
and commissions do not match the di-
versity of their communities. They are 
groups of wealthy leaders or of activ-
ists who are there, but they don’t 
match the diversity, and the leadership 
of those boards and commissions cer-
tainly don’t rotate enough to allow the 
leaders of the boards and commissions 
that the cities use to have diversity. 
Every year from this House and Sen-
ate, we put out community develop-
ment block grants. Why don’t we just 
add to the community development 
block grants that cities and commu-
nities can get access to these commu-
nity development block grants and 
help improve their situations if they 
also improve access and opportunity to 
individuals within the communities so 
they may also lead in those commu-
nities. If your boards and commissions 
don’t reflect the diversity of your com-
munity, there is a problem with that 
city in the way it is actually designing 
the leadership structure of how deci-
sions are made with Federal dollars. 
This is not a hard way to be able to 
raise up new leaders who will get their 
voices heard at city hall and get their 
voices heard on how funds are actually 
used. 
Oftentimes, big city police depart-
ments don’t share the same racial di-
versity of the city itself. Why don’t we 
allow some of the grant money that we 
have that we already dedicate to law 
enforcement to be given to recruiters 
so they can recruit from the same di-
versity of their communities and actu-
ally help to pay the salaries of people 
who are stepping in during the earliest 
days in the police academy and as they 
are starting into the force? That way, 
the diversity in our big city police de-
partments will also match the diver-
sity of the communities themselves, 
and if they have a difficult time re-
cruiting, we will allow them to use 
those funds for recruiters. 
You see, I really do believe there are 
things that we can do that will make a 
practical difference, but I also firmly 
believe that racism is not a legislative 
issue—it is a heart issue, and it is a 
family issue. One of the biggest things 
we have is the bully pulpit to be able to 
challenge individuals and push back on 
individuals. Do, quite frankly, what-
ever you can to push this. When I start-
ed 5 years ago, I was asking people a 
simple question: Has your family ever 
invited another family of another race 
into your home for dinner? It was just 
a simple question. 
I have been amazed at the number of 
people I have talked to in my State— 
people of all races—when I have asked 
them: Has your family ever invited an-
other family of another race into your 
home for dinner, they have responded 
back to me: I have friends of another 
race, to which I have always smiled at 
them and said: That is not what I 
asked. It is not: Do you have friends of 
another race? Has your family ever in-
vited a family of another race to your 
home for a meal just for your kids to 
sit together and talk, just for your two 
families to sit and visit like neighbors 
would do? I have been astounded at the 
number of people whose thresholds of 
race are the thresholds of their own 
homes. Why would that barrier be 
there, and how do we break that bar-
rier? 
A friend of mine raised an interesting 
question to me this past weekend. A

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2761 
June 8, 2020 
couple of years ago, as a law enforce-
ment officer, he slipped into the Mu-
seum of African American History and 
found out that the Metro Police, which 
is here in the DC metro area, goes over 
to the Museum of African American 
History and gets a guided tour through 
that facility to help new police officers 
get an understanding of African-Amer-
ican history from a law enforcement 
perspective and see what has happened 
to the relationship between law en-
forcement and African Americans over 
the centuries. 
He joined that tour, and his state-
ment to me was, I wish every police de-
partment could get that kind of train-
ing; that they could go to that museum 
and could get that kind of context. 
My statement back to him was that 
we do that with the Holocaust Mu-
seum. 
The Holocaust Museum does tours 
and is currently designing a cur-
riculum by which to train trainers and 
work on anti-Semitism across the en-
tire country. This body helped to get 
that done. Why don’t we do that with 
the Museum of African American His-
tory and law enforcement? Challenge 
them to take the program they already 
have and turn it into a curriculum. 
Train the trainers and then get that 
out across the entire country. Multiply 
that out. Why couldn’t we do that? 
Every year when Police Week occurs, 
why couldn’t we have a large contin-
gency of law enforcement go through 
the Museum of African American His-
tory, get that training there, and then 
take that training back home? Why 
couldn’t that happen? It could if this 
body were willing to step up and do 
some pragmatic things—engage in ac-
tually finding practical ways to con-
tinue the work that our Nation is 
doing. 
You see, we are not at the beginning 
with regard to race. We are four cen-
turies into this conversation. Yet what 
I will remind everyone is that we are 
actually trying. There are many places 
in the world that are not working on 
race relations at all in their countries. 
If you are not the dominant race, you 
are still excluded from the courts, from 
education, from access. As a country, 
we are trying, but for those who think 
we are done, they are wrong. We are 
not done with the journey. 
I love pointing out to people: Watch 
the beginning of the Olympics when all 
of the countries march in. Almost 
every delegation under every flag looks 
alike until the United States marches 
in, and you see this great diversity of 
our athletes. It again reminds us that 
we are trying, but the past 10 days 
should also remind us that we are not 
done. Let’s continue doing the hard 
work that needs to be done with our 
own families. Let’s continue to do the 
legislative work that needs to be done 
to make progress, but let’s keep going 
until it is done. 
My friend said to me last weekend 
that our founding documents are great 
founding documents. We have just 
never actually fully lived them out for 
everybody. I can’t wait for us to con-
tinue the work in this body toward be-
coming a more perfect Union. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

S. RES. 602 
∑ Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, due to 
a clerical error, the junior Senator 
from California, Ms. HARRIS, was not 
added as an original cosponsor of S. 
Res. 602, a resolution that we intro-
duced together on June 2, 2020, recog-
nizing that the murder of George Floyd 
by officers of the Minneapolis Police 
Department is the result of pervasive 
and systemic racism that cannot be 
dismantled 
without, 
among 
other 
things, proper redress in the courts. 
Senator HARRIS understands that law 
enforcement should not be completely 
shielded 
from 
accountability 
when 
they violate someone’s civil rights, and 
that the Supreme Court’s qualified im-
munity doctrine is broken. I thank her 
for her support in leading the effort to 
abolish qualified immunity for law en-
forcement officers in its current form.∑

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JOHN D. DWYER 
∑ Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Mr. 
John Dwyer has distinguishably served 
the U.S. Coast Guard and our Nation 
for more than 43 years, on Active Duty, 
in the Coast Guard reserves, and as a 
long-time Coast Guard civilian serving 
in Seattle, WA. 
John earned his bachelor’s degree 
from Gonzaga University in 1976 and 
was selected shortly thereafter to at-
tend Coast Guard Officer Candidate 
School. Upon his graduation in 1977, he 
was commissioned as an Active-Duty 
officer in the Coast Guard. In 1985, he 
transitioned to the Coast Guard re-
serves, where he continued to advance 
until retiring as a captain in 2005, 
while serving as the Pacific Area Re-
serve Chief of Staff. During this time, 
John also earned his master’s degree 
from the University of Washington, 
School of Marine Affairs, in 2004 and 
became a Department of Homeland Se-
curity senior fellow. Concurrent with 
his Reserve status, John began his 
service as a Coast Guard civilian em-
ployee in 1986, allowing him to focus 
his expertise on the Puget Sound re-
gion and serve as an invaluable source 
of knowledge and continuity for the ro-
tating Coast Guard personnel. Ulti-
mately, he advanced to serve as the of-
ficer in charge, marine inspection and 
the chief of the Inspection Division at 
U.S. Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound. 
In this important role, John was re-
sponsible for ensuring the safety, envi-
ronmental protection, and security 
standards for commercial vessels and 
waterfront facilities throughout Puget 
Sound, as well as the navigable waters 
of Washington State and Montana. 
Throughout his service while in uni-
form, John was repeatedly recognized 
for actions that increased safety in the 
maritime industry. As early as 1977, as 
a young lieutenant, John improved the 
safety of the vital North Pacific mari-
time industry as he helped establish an 
uninspected vessel examination pro-
gram in the Coast Guard’s 17th district. 
The processes he established were 
smoothly transitioned from the dis-
trict offices to a new field unit, the Ma-
rine Safety Office in Anchorage, AK. 
He was recognized in the early 1990s as 
commanding officer of the Reserve unit 
in Tacoma, WA, where John systemati-
cally found meaningful ways to in-
crease reserve member participation in 
marine safety inspections, which had 
traditionally been conducted by Ac-
tive-Duty members. By enhancing the 
role for reservists in marine inspec-
tions, John improved the safety of peo-
ple in the commercial fishing and mar-
itime industries, while also boosting 
the efficiency of the Coast Guard. 
During his years of public service, 
John directly contributed to the mari-
time safety and security of our Nation. 
John’s direct oversight ensured the 
seamless flow of maritime commerce, 
including the transportation of almost 
24 million passengers per year on the 
Washington State ferries, the largest 
ferry system in the United States. He 
led the effort to create the region’s 
first multiagency maritime security 
team that was responsible for the secu-
rity of the expansive international 
maritime border between the United 
States and Canada. This successful pro-
gram was adopted and became a best 
practice throughout the Nation. John 
was also directly involved in ensuring 
the safety of commercial fishing ves-
sels in the North Pacific and Bering 
Sea fisheries, worth more than $4 bil-
lion annually. His work with the fish-
ing 
community 
undoubtedly 
saved 
lives and resulted in John becoming 
the standard-bearer for fishing vessel 
safety to Coast Guard members, fisher-
men, and policymakers across the Na-
tion. 
Above his exemplary execution of 
Coast Guard mission requirements, 
John left his mark as a skilled and 
thoughtful mentor. John served as a 
patient teacher and remarkable mentor 
for thousands of Coast Guard per-
sonnel. He generously shared his 43 
years of maritime experience in vessel 
inspections, port security, waterfront

facility inspections, mariner licensing, 
casualty investigations, and marine 
disaster and firefighting response to 
train the next generation of leaders 
within the Coast Guard’s Marine Safe-
ty program. His leadership and com-
mitment to the professional develop-
ment of others made an incredible im-
pact on more than 1,200 Coast Guard 
junior officers and enlisted members, 
many of whom are now serving as exec-
utive level leaders in the Coast Guard 
and throughout the Federal Govern-
ment. His mentees include a member of 
the Senior Executive Service, three 
Coast Guard flag officers, 10 Coast 
Guard captains of the Port, and several 
enlisted members who are now serving 
in successful leadership roles in gov-
ernment and private industry. 
During my time on the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation, I have had the benefit 
of working with a number of Coast 
Guard 
members 
that 
had 
been 
mentored by John. John trained them 
well. Without a doubt, these members 
have left their mark on multiple Coast 
Guard authorization bills that have 
been signed into law with meaningful 
improvements to maritime safety and 
environmental protection at the na-
tional level. I am personally grateful 
to have had the opportunity to work 
with so many members who were 
mentored by John, and I am sure that, 
after John retires, I will continue to 
learn from those he influenced over his 
long career. 
John also served as an influential 
leader within Puget Sound’s maritime 
community. In the wake of the tragedy 
of September 11th, he played a key role 
in Puget Sound as the Coast Guard im-
plemented 
the 
Maritime 
Transpor-
tation Security Act of 2002. He served 
as the head of the vessel security and 
Washington State ferries security sub- 
committees within the Puget Sound 
Maritime 
Security 
Committee 
and 
played a critical advisory role in Puget 
Sound’s Harbor Safety Committee. He 
was always available to provide advice 
on maritime topics and was frequently 
invited to speak at maritime events. In 
recognition of his tremendous impact, 
the Seattle Propeller Club named John 
as its Public Official of the Year in 2013 
and the Puget Sound Port Maritime 
Council recognized him as its Maritime 
Person of the Year in 2017. 
John’s actions and decisions were al-
ways in the best interest of the public 
in which he selflessly and tirelessly 
served as he worked to ensure the safe-
ty, security, and environmental protec-
tion of Washington State and the pris-
tine waters of Puget Sound. He will be 
missed, but his legacy of service and 
those he trained will live on. I thank 
John Dwyer for his selfless service to 
the United States Coast Guard, the en-
tire Pacific Northwest, and our Nation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. COLLINS: 
S. 3907. A bill to provide that all crit-
ical access hospitals are eligible for 
loans under the paycheck protection 
program, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship. 
f 
PPP FOR CRITICAL ACCESS 
HOSPITALS ACT 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce legislation to allow 
nonprofit critical access hospitals (as 
defined by the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services) that are undergoing 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganizations 
to apply for forgivable loans under the 
Paycheck Protection Program, if they 
are otherwise eligible. The language of 
my bill, the ‘‘PPP Critical Access Hos-
pitals Act,’’ mirrors language origi-
nally introduced by Rep. GOLDEN that 
was included in the House-passed ‘‘HE-
ROES Act.’’ 
While hospitals are not prohibited 
from participating in the PPP, those 
that have previously or are currently 
under bankruptcy protection have been 
unable to access PPP funds, due to an 
interpretation 
of 
underlying 
Small 
Business Administration 7(a) program 
rules. While I recognize the importance 
of protecting taxpayer investments in 
the SBA 7(a) program, the PPP pro-
gram, which I coauthored along with 
Senators RUBIO, CARDIN, and SHAHEEN, 
is by design largely forgivable when 
used for eligible expenditures. 
The hospitals that would benefit 
from this bill are critical infrastruc-
ture in the COVID–19 response effort, 
and many have experienced substantial 
increases in expenses associated with 
preparing for and responding to the 
pandemic. They simultaneously faced 
sharp declines in revenue associated 
with declining patient volumes due to 
the cancellation of routine and elective 
procedures, in order to protect public 
health and conserve limited supplies of 
Personal Protective Equipment, con-
sistent with guidance from the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
While these entities are few in num-
ber, they are vitally important to the 
communities they serve, both as front-
line health care providers during this 
public health emergency and as anchor 
institutions that provide the pay-
checks and local economic stability 
that Congress intended the Paycheck 
Protection Program to preserve. These 
institutions need temporary financial 
assistance to weather sharp revenue 
decreases that have resulted from Fed-
eral and State instructions to cancel 
elective medical procedures as part of 
COVID–19 response preparedness. Ex-
panding the PPP to include these key 
employers will allow them to keep 
their doors open until they can resume 
normal operations once pandemic-re-
lated disruptions to their operations 
have passed. 
Two institutions in Maine that would 
benefit from this bill are Penobscot 
Valley Hospital in Lincoln, and Calais 
Regional Hospital, in Calais. Both are 
in the midst of Chapter 11 proceedings, 
and both have suffered serious revenue 
shortfalls due to the cancellation or 
scaling back of elective procedures dur-
ing the pandemic. 
The bill I am introducing today is 
carefully targeted to address a unique 
financial situation that frontline crit-
ical access hospitals face during this 
public health emergency. I urge my 
colleagues to support it.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
108TH 
BIRTHDAY 
OF 
LUCILLE 
DORO-
THY GREWE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 8, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Lucille Grewe as she celebrates her 108th 
birthday on Tuesday, June 2nd, 2020. This 
significant milestone is worthy of commenda-
tion. 
Lucille Grewe was born in 1912 and grew 
up in the small town of Buckner, Illinois. As 
the third of five children born to Ernst and Ber-
tha Grewe, Lucille fondly remembers playing 
outside with her family and walking with her 
siblings to deliver coffee and a lunch bucket to 
her father during his lunch break at the mines. 
Throughout her life, Lucille has experienced 
a tremendous amount of change. She grew up 
in simpler times without telephones, few auto-
mobiles, and limited women’s rights, and she 
has been a witness to some of America’s 
most defining and challenging moments. At 
the young age of three, Lucille remembers 
watching her cousin from her back porch as 
he walked off to serve in World War I. Several 
years later, she lived through the ratification of 
the 19th Amendment, granting women the 
right to vote. By the 1930s, Lucille worked 
alongside her mother and siblings on a family 
farm, raising livestock and harvesting crops, to 
help her family endure the difficulties of the 
Great Depression. 
When Lucille was in her 20s, she followed 
her older sister Alma to Detroit, Michigan. She 
found a job at Briggs Automotive working on 
car bodies at the Mack Avenue Plant, where 
she earned 40 cents an hour. After the attack 
on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Lucille stepped up to 
America’s call. She was transferred to Brigg’s 
Connor Avenue Plant to work as a riveter on 
Boeing B–17 wings for the duration of World 
War II until 1946. As a Rosie the Riveter, Lu-
cille’s hard work, grit, and patriotism not only 
sustained the American war effort, but paved 
a path for generations of working women to 
follow. After the war, Lucille returned to the 
Mack Avenue Plant to work on car bodies 
once more. She remained with the company 
through its transition to Chrysler, and finally 
retired in 1971 at the age of 59. 
Since retirement, Lucille has taken up a 
number of hobbies including swimming, bowl-
ing, and traveling. Today, she enjoys playing 
cards, specifically pinochle, and spending time 
with her friends. Lucille is known for her great 
attitude, sense of humor, and enthusiasm. She 
has been both an inspiration and a mentor to 
many, and she continues to live a fruitful life. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating Lucille Dorothy Grewe on 
her 108th birthday. I join with Lucille’s family 
and friends in extending my best and warmest 
wishes to her on this special day. I am proud 
to honor her life, her accomplishments, and 
her invaluable contributions to our nation. 
HONORING CONGRESSMAN SAM 
JOHNSON 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 8, 2020 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor former Con-
gressman, War Hero, and Chairman of the 
Ways and Means Social Security Sub-
committee Sam Johnson. 
Sam Johnson was an iconic American war 
hero. He epitomized the stoic silence and 
toughness needed to persevere through his 
captivity by the Viet Cong. He was a decent, 
caring, and humble American whose nobility 
was measured by his actions, not his words. 
Engraved above the Speaker’s rostrum in the 
House of Representatives it says, ‘that we 
may in our day and generation perform some-
thing worthy to be remembered.’ Sam John-
son lived up to that. He would look you in the 
eye and his word was his bond. He never 
sought the limelight; he always just sought to 
do what was right. 
Johnson served 29 successful years in the 
Air Force and spent seven of those years as 
a prisoner of war. He shared many stories 
from the years he was held captive. Johnson 
was a staunch patriot, often expressing his 
deeply held patriotism as cause for his civil 
service. A result of his dedication, he was 
awarded two Silver Stars, two Legions of 
Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, one 
Bronze Star with Valor, two Purple Hearts, 
four Air Medals, three Outstanding Unit 
Awards, and the Freedom of Flight award. As 
a sincere supporter of the military, Johnson 
worked to enact the Military Family Tax Relief 
Act of 2003, which increased benefits to mem-
bers of the armed forces and their families. 
Johnson represented Texas for almost 28 
years, the oldest Member of Congress, when 
he retired in 2019. Serving as the Chair of the 
Ways and Means Social Security Sub-
committee, Johnson was committed to Social 
Security solvency. He never wavered on the 
importance of our seniors retiring securely and 
often expressed concern for future bene-
ficiaries. I was privileged to serve as the 
Ranking Democrat alongside Sam Johnson 
during his time as Chairman of the Social Se-
curity Subcommittee and will always cherish 
the friendship we formed. 
In 2016, Johnson rightfully received the 
Congressional Patriot Award alongside JOHN 
LEWIS. They were the first recipients of the 
award. It was presented to them by two other 
American heroes, Ambassador Andrew Young 
Jr. and the late Senator John McCain. John-
son and LEWIS are two giants of American his-
tory and are reminders that patriotism knows 
no party. I was honored to have a part in cele-
brating them both that night. 
America and the United States Congress 
lost a true hero with his passing. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with his family. He will be 
dearly missed.

HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS

Monday, June 8, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, due to a per-
sonal matter, I was unable to make the vote

RECOGNIZING AMBER HARBIN 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 8, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the accomplishments 
of Amber Harbin, a science teacher at Forest 
Heights Stem Academy. 
Amber was recently named the Little Rock 
School District’s 2020 Teacher of the Year. 
This award recognizes a devotion to edu-
cation, with high-quality teaching, community 
service, and leadership. 
As a result of her hard work, Amber was 
also awarded the Marian G. Lacey Educator of 
the Year Award, a top award within the Little 
Rock School District. 
Amber’s dedication to her students has 
been evident throughout her 13-year career as 
a science teacher most recently at Forest 
Heights Stem Academy. 
Amber Harbin’s commitment to education is 
one all Americans and Arkansans can admire. 
I’d like to thank Amber, and all of the dedi-
cated educators throughout Arkansas, for 
service and leadership in these trying times for 
central Arkansas’s communities.

HARDWORKING 
AMERICANS 
DURING 
CORONAVIRUS 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 8, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I am here 
today to point out how some people rise to the 
occasion during times of crisis, and by simply 
doing their jobs, they rise above the confusion 
and exceed the performance and expectations 
of those around them. Specifically, I am talk-
ing about the coronavirus pandemic, and not 
just its national impact, but its impact in our 
capital of Washington, D.C. The capital be-
came a ghost town in March and April, and 
even in May, as restaurants everywhere were 
closed and everyone sheltered in place. There 
were very few options and very few res-
taurants that had the team spirit and deter-
mination to stay open. 
But there was one restaurant, a McDonald’s 
in Southwest, D.C., at 400 C St. S.W., that

persevered. They rallied and stayed open the 
entire pandemic with a crew of dedicated staff 
that wore protective equipment, rearranged 
the restaurant for takeout only, and otherwise 
got to work. One manager named Aaron, 
worked long shifts with a great attitude. 
This store’s dedication provided some of the 
only food available in the area, including to 
members of Congress like me. I very much 
appreciated their work, their commitment and 
their resolve. Congratulations to the team 
there, the management and to the entire crew 
who really proved how tough they were.

HONORING ROBERT RICHMOND’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. LARRY BUCSHON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 8, 2020 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Robert Richmond on his 100th 
birthday. 
Robert was born on March 12, 1920, to Wil-
liam and Mary Richmond in Chandler, Indiana. 
After graduating from Chandler High School, 
he attended the Mechanical Arts School and 
received his Certificate of Achievement in De-
cember 1940. After the United States entered 
World War II the next year, Robert was draft-
ed into the Army, serving in the Reconnais-
sance Company of the 638th Tank Destroyer 
Battalion. His time in the Army took him from 
training in Fort Benning, Georgia, to the 
Ardennes Forest in Belgium, where he partici-
pated in the Battle of the Bulge. Robert served 
honorably and received the Purple Heart, the 
Bronze Star, and Good Conduct Medals be-
fore leaving the service at the rank of staff 
sergeant. 
After the war, Robert went to work for the 
Boonville Natural Gas Corporation for 30 
years. He married his wife of 71 years, Evelyn 
Dimmett, on November 9, 1946, and the cou-
ple had two children, Greg (1950) and Gary 
(1954). Throughout his life, he has remained 
committed to his faith, family, and commu-
nity—not only as an active member of his 
church and hardworking employee, but also as 
a loyal husband, father, and friend. 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure 
today to recognize Robert on his great mile-
stone. On behalf of Indiana’s Eighth District, I 
wish him well, and I thank him for everything 
he has done for his community and his coun-
try.

HONORING 
ROBERT 
KOLAS 
FOR 
HIS 
THIRTY-ONE 
YEARS 
AS 
MAYOR OF HIGGINSVILLE, MIS-
SOURI 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 8, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I proudly 
rise today to recognize Mayor Robert ‘‘Bill’’ 
Kolas for his 31 years of dedicated service to 
the community in his role as Mayor of 
Higginsville, Missouri. Having been steadfast 
in his commitment to the betterment of this 
small, close-knit community, Mayor Kolas un-
doubtedly leaves behind a legacy of unparal-
leled leadership. 
Mayor Kolas was born in Carrollton, Mis-
souri, the son of William and Doris Kolas. 
Going into his 5th grade year, his family 
moved to Higginsville, Missouri and estab-
lished themselves within the community. 
Mayor Kolas graduated from Higginsville High 
School in 1957 and went on to work in con-
struction for two years before he joined the 
United States Navy in October of 1959. After 
proudly serving a four-year tour, Mayor Kolas 
returned to Higginsville before taking on a 
traveling sales position. For the next 20 years, 
Mayor Kolas represented livestock feed com-
panies, encompassing a Midwest region of 
five states. In 1977, he made Higginsville his 
homestead for good, settling in with his be-
loved wife and daughter, and has remained an 
active force in the community since then. 
After a two-year term serving on the Board 
of Alderman, Bill sought the mayorship, suc-
cessfully winning his election and serving a 
two year term. Dedicated to carrying out and 
directly shaping the community, Bill ran for 
mayor again in 1991 and has been leading 
Higginsville as mayor ever since. Mayor Kolas’ 
list of accomplishments is expansive. Under 
his leadership, the Tax Increment Financing 
Commission was established, the power plant 
was expanded, the city took on a sewer im-
provement project and constructed 3 miles of 
sidewalks, and a 1⁄4 cent public safety tax was 
passed, just to name a few. Moreover, in addi-
tion to mayor, Bill serves his community in 
many roles ranging from Founding Committee 
Member of the Lafayette County LEAD 2000 
leadership program, Board Member, Vice 
President, and President of the Missouri Mu-
nicipal League, Council Chair for the Pioneer 
Trails Regional Planning Commission, to the 
President of the Whiteman Airforce Base 
Community Council. 
Madam Speaker, please join me honoring 
Mayor Bill Kolas’ 31 years of leading the 
Higginsville, Missouri community. On behalf of 
the people of Higginsville and Missouri’s Fifth 
Congressional District, myself included, I thank 
him for his dedicated service to the public. I 
wish him the best in this next chapter of his 
life.
