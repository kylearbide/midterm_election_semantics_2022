CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H338 
January 24, 2020 
[January 22, 2020] 
OMB RELEASES 192 PAGES OF UKRAINE 
RECORDS TO AMERICAN OVERSIGHT 
At 11:58 p.m. on Jan. 21, just two minutes 
before the deadline, the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget released 192 pages of 
Ukraine-related 
documents, 
including 
records that have not been produced to Con-
gress in its impeachment investigation. 
Included in the documents are emails from 
OMB Acting Director Russell Vought and 
Michael Duffey, OMB’s associate director for 
national security, including one from Duffey 
on the day of President Donald Trump’s July 
25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelenksy. Both officials were key players in 
the withholding of aid to Ukraine last fall, 
which last week the Government Account-
ability Office said was illegal. 
As the president’s defenders in the Senate 
repeatedly voted down amendments to sub-
poena documents and witnesses in the Sen-
ate impeachment trial, these documents— 
obtained through the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act—show a flurry of activity on a num-
ber of days in late June 2019 after a Wash-
ington 
Examiner 
article 
<https:// 
www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/de-
fense-national-security/pentagon-to-send- 
250m-in-weapons-to-ukraine> about military 
assistance for Ukraine. Additional emails 
through the summer and early fall, when 
Pentagon official Elaine McCusker was rais-
ing concerns about the legality of the freeze, 
are heavily redacted. 
American Oversight filed several FOIA re-
quests with OMB on for a range of records re-
lated to the office’s role in suspending mili-
tary aid to Ukraine as part of the president’s 
attempt to pressure Ukraine to launch a po-
litical investigation. OMB agreed to search 
for and release by Jan. 21, 2020, records of 
emails sent by Vought and Duffey containing 
key terms related Ukraine, as well as copies 
of the July 25 OMB memo justifying the 
withholding of aid. 
Statement from Austin Evers, American 
Oversight’s executive director: 
‘‘President Trump’s lawyers stood in the 
Senate on Tuesday arguing that documents 
are totally unnecessary for the impeachment 
trial, but these documents give lie to that 
entire position. Despite the Trump Adminis-
tration’s obstruction and the rhetoric at the 
trial, the public can now see even more evi-
dence of the president’s corrupt scheme as it 
unfolded in real time. The volume of mate-
rial released, and the volume of material 
still secreted away, only highlights how 
much the administration has withheld from 
the House, the Senate, and the American 
public.’’

[From rollingstone.com, Jan. 22 2020] 
TRUMP BRAGS ABOUT CONCEALING IMPEACH-
MENT EVIDENCE: ‘WE HAVE ALL THE MATE-
RIAL, THEY DON’T’ 
(By Peter Wade) 
President Trump said he’s happy with the 
way the impeachment trial is going thus far 
because his administration has not released 
‘‘materials’’ that would hurt his cause. 
‘‘When we released that conversation all 
hell broke out with the Democrats,’’ Trump 
said. ‘‘Because they said, ‘Wait a minute, 
this is much different than [what Adam 
Schiff] told us.’ ’’ 
The president continued, ‘‘So, we’re doing 
very well. I got to watch [the impeachment 
trial] enough. I thought our team did a very 
good job. But honestly, we have all the mate-
rial. They don’t have the material.’’ 
Trump made the stark admission while at-
tending the World Economic Forum in 
Davos, Switzerland. 
When asked about the impeachment trial, 
Trump initially spoke about what he usually 
refers to as the ‘‘perfect call’’ with Ukrain-
ian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In that 
phone conversation, on July 25, 2019, Trump 
reportedly asked Zelensky to investigate the 
Bidens eight times. 
The Trump administration has exerted ex-
ecutive privilege while ignoring subpoenas 
for documents and have directed individuals 
not to respond to subpoena requests since 
the beginning of the impeachment process. 
For comparison, the Clinton administration 
turned over more than 90,000 pages of docu-
ments and material during its impeachment. 
Usually, the Trump administration either 
refuses to explain their stonewalling or ex-
cuses their lack of cooperation away by 
bashing the investigation, calling it illegit-
imate or a witch hunt. But here, rather as-
tonishingly, Trump seems to be flatly admit-
ting to withholding evidence.

Let us pray. 
Almighty God, as we resume this im-
peachment trial, let Your will be done. 
Enlighten our Senators as You show

States is sitting for the trial of the articles 
of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
Representatives against Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
for all of our colleagues’ information 
about scheduling, today we will plan to 
take short breaks every 2 to 3 hours 
and will accommodate a 30-minute re-
cess for dinner, assuming it is needed, 
until the House managers have finished 
their opening presentation. 
For scheduling purposes, we have or-
ganized tomorrow’s session to convene 
at 10 a.m. and run for several hours as 
the President’s counsel begin their 
presentation. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to 
the provisions of S. Res. 483, the man-
agers for the House of Representatives 
have 7 hours 53 minutes remaining to 
make the presentation of their case. 
The Senate will now hear you. 
OPENING STATEMENT—CONTINUED 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, distinguished counsel of 
the President, I keep wanting to say 
‘‘good morning,’’ but good afternoon. I 
just wanted to give a very brief ori-
entation to the argument you will hear 
today. 
We will begin with JASON CROW, who 
was talking about the conditionality of 
the military assistance. This is the lat-
ter part, although not the end, of the 
argumentation on the application of 
the constitutional law as it respects ar-
ticle I, the abuse of power. I will have 
a presentation after Mr. CROW, and 
soon thereafter we will conclude the 
presentation on article I. We will then 
begin the presentation on article II, 
once again applying the constitutional 
law to the facts on the President’s ob-
struction of Congress. We will then 
have some concluding thoughts and 
then turn it over to the President’s 
counsel. 
That is what you should expect for 
the day, and with that, I will now yield 
to Mr. CROW of Colorado. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, good afternoon. I woke up this 
morning and walked to my local coffee 
shop, where, unlike my esteemed col-
league Mr. JEFFRIES from New York, 
nobody complained to me about Colo-
rado baseball. So I could only conclude 
that this is only a New York Yankees 
problem. 
As Mr. SCHIFF mentioned, we talked 
last night about the July 25 call and 
the multiple officials who had con-
firmed the intent of the President in 
withholding the aid, so now I would 
like to turn to what happened around 
the time the aid was lifted. 
We know that the aid was lifted ulti-
mately on September 11, but it wasn’t 
lifted for any legitimate reason. It was 
only lifted because President Trump 
had gotten caught. Let’s go through 
how we know that. 
On August 26, the whistleblower com-
plaint had been sent to the Director of 
National Intelligence, and public re-
ports indicate that President Trump 
was told about the complaint by White 
House Counsel Pat Cipollone. 
On September 5, though, the scheme 
became public. An editorial in the 
Washington Post on that day, for the 
first time publicly, explicitly linked 
the military aid hold and the investiga-
tions that President Trump wanted. 
Keep in mind that public scrutiny of 
the President’s hold increased exponen-
tially after this became public. And 
this is where things start moving real-
ly fast. 
A few days later, on September 9, the 
House investigative committees pub-
licly announced their investigation of 
the President’s conduct in Ukraine. 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified 
to the National Security Council, and 
others at the White House learned 
about the investigation when it was 
announced. And a colleague of his said 
that it might have the effect of releas-
ing the aid. On that same day, the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S532 
January 24, 2020 
House Intelligence Committee learns 
that the administration had withheld 
the whistleblower complaint from Con-
gress. The scheme was unravelling. 
What happens 2 days later? President 
Trump released the military aid. 
He only released it after he got 
caught. But there is another reason we 
know the President lifted the aid only 
because he got caught: because there is 
no other explanation. The testimony of 
all of the witnesses confirmed it. Both 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. 
Williams testified that they were not 
provided any reason for lifting the 
hold. Vindman testified that nothing 
on the ground had changed in the 2 
months of the hold, and Mark Sandy of 
the OMB also confirmed that. Ambas-
sador Taylor, too, testified that ‘‘I was 
not told the reason why the hold had 
been lifted.’’ 
Let me take a moment to address an-
other defense I expect you will hear: 
that the aid was released and the inves-
tigations were never announced; so 
therefore no harm, no foul, right? Well, 
this defense would be laughable if this 
issue wasn’t so serious. 
First, I have spoken over the past 3 
days about the real consequences of in-
serting politics into matters of war. 
Real people, real lives are at stake. 
Every day, every hour matters. So, no, 
the delay wasn’t meaningless. Just ask 
the Ukrainians sitting in trenches 
right now. And to this day, they are 
still waiting on $18 million of the aid 
that hasn’t reached them. 
Jennifer Williams, who attended the 
Warsaw meeting with Vice President 
PENCE, described President Zelensky’s 
focus during this time. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And you testified in your 
deposition that in that conversation Presi-
dent Zelensky emphasized that the military 
assistance, the security assistance, was not 
just important to assist Ukraine in fighting 
a war against Russia but that it was also 
symbolic in nature. What did you understand 
him to mean by that? 
Ms. WILLIAMS. President Zelensky ex-
plained that more than—or just equally 
with—the financial and physical value of the 
assistance, that it was the symbolic nature 
of that assistance that really was the show 
of U.S. support for Ukraine and for Ukraine’s 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I 
think he was stressing that to the Vice 
President to really underscore the need for 
the security assistance to be released. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And, then, if the United 
States was holding the security assistance, 
is it also true then that Russia could see 
that as a sign of weakening U.S. support for 
Ukraine and take advantage of that? 
Ms. WILLIAMS. I believe that is what 
President Zelensky was indicating, that any 
signal or sign that U.S. support was waver-
ing would be construed by Russia as poten-
tially an opportunity for them to strengthen 
their own hand in Ukraine. 
Mr. Manager CROW. This is an im-
portant point, particularly when the 
President and his attorneys tried to 
argue: no harm, no foul. 
The financial assistance itself was 
really important to Ukraine, no ques-
tion about it. But the aid was equally 
important as a signal to Russia of our 
support for Ukraine. And regardless of 
whether the aid was ultimately re-
leased, the fact that the hold became 
public sent a very clear signal to Rus-
sia that our support for Ukraine was 
wavering, and Russia was watching 
very closely for any sign of weakness. 
The damage was done. 
Now, 
any 
possible 
doubt 
about 
whether the aid was linked to the in-
vestigations has been erased by the 
President’s own Chief of Staff. We have 
seen this video before during the trial, 
but there is a really good reason for 
this. It is a complete admission on na-
tional TV that the military aid was 
conditioned on Ukraine helping the 
President’s political campaign. 
Here, once again, is what Mulvaney 
said. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. MULVANEY. Did he also mention to 
me in the past the corruption related to the 
DNC server? Absolutely. No question about 
that. But that is it. And that’s why we held 
up the money. 
Mr. Manager CROW. When pressed 
that he just confessed to the very quid 
pro quo that President Trump had been 
denying, Mulvaney doubled down. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
QUESTION. To be clear, what you just de-
scribed is a quid pro quo. Funding will not 
flow unless the investigation into the Demo-
cratic server happened as well. 
Mr. MULVANEY. We do that all the time 
with foreign policy. If you read the news re-
ports and you believe them, what did McKin-
ney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yes-
terday that he was really upset with the po-
litical influence in foreign policy. That was 
one of the reasons he was so upset about 
this. And I have news for everybody: Get 
over it. There is going to be political influ-
ence in foreign policy. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Remember, at 
the time he made these statements, 
Mulvaney was both the head of OMB 
and the Acting Chief of Staff at the 
White House. He knew about all of the 
legal concerns. He also knew about the 
President’s so-called drug deal, as Am-
bassador Bolton called it. He knew ex-
actly what was going on in the Oval Of-
fice and how OMB implemented the 
President’s illegal order to hold the 
aid. 
Mulvaney confirmed why the Presi-
dent ordered the hold. It was not to de-
velop further policy to counter aggres-
sion. It was not to convince the 
Ukrainians to implement additional 
anti-corruption reforms. And it was 
not to pressure our allies to give more 
to Ukraine. 
Since we won’t have an opportunity 
to respond to the President’s presen-
tation, I am going to take a minute to 
respond to some of the arguments that 
I expect them to make. 
You will notice, I am sure, that they 
will ignore significant portions of the 
evidence, while trying to cherry-pick 
individual statements here and there 
to manufacture defenses. But don’t be 
fooled. 
One defense you may hear is that the 
aid was held up to allow for a policy re-
view. This is what the administration 
told the GAO at one point. But the evi-
dence shows the opposite. The evidence 
shows that the administration didn’t 
conduct a review at any time after the 
President ordered the hold. 
Laura Cooper was not aware of any 
review of the funding conducted by 
DOD in July, August, or September, 
and, similarly, George Kent testified 
that the State Department did not con-
duct and was never asked to conduct a 
review of funding administrated by the 
State Department. In fact, on May 23, 
the anti-corruption review was com-
plete and DOD certified to Congress 
that Ukraine had complied with all of 
the conditions and that the remaining 
half of the aid should be released. This 
was confirmed by the June 18 press re-
lease announcing the funding. 
Do 
you 
remember 
the 
fictitious 
‘‘interagency review process’’? That 
was made up too. No review is nec-
essary because it had already been 
done. 
Next, the President’s counsel keeps 
saying this was about corruption in 
Ukraine. President Trump was not con-
cerned with fighting corruption. It is 
difficult to even say that with a 
straight face. The President never 
mentioned corruption on either call 
with President Zelensky. But let’s go 
through the evidence. 
As we just discussed, DOD had al-
ready completed a review and con-
cluded that Ukraine had ‘‘made suffi-
cient progress in meeting defense re-
form and anti-corruption goals con-
sistent with the National Defense Au-
thorization Act in order to receive the 
funds.’’ 
In fact, Mark Sandy, who was not at 
that meeting but who was initially re-
sponsible for approving the hold, said 
he had never heard corruption as a rea-
son for the hold in all of the discus-
sions he had about it. 
Similar to the anti-corruption argu-
ment, there is simply no evidence to 
support the President’s after-the-fact 
argument that he was concerned about 
burden-sharing; that is, other countries 
also contributing to Ukraine. 
I imagine the President may cite the 
emails in June about what other coun-
tries provided to Ukraine, the reference 
to other countries’ contributions in the 
July 25 call, and testimony from Sandy 
about a request for information about 
what other European countries give to 
Ukraine. But there is simply no evi-
dence that ties the concern to his deci-
sion to hold the funding. 
First, let’s actually look at the con-
tributions of European countries to 
Ukraine. There is a slide in front of 
you. It shows that other European 
countries have significantly contrib-
uted to Ukraine since 2014, and the Eu-
ropean Union, in total, has given far 
more than the United States. The EU 
is the single largest donor to Ukraine, 
having provided over $16 billion in 
grants and loans. 
The President’s assertion that other 
countries did not support Ukraine is 
meritless. There are other reasons too.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S533 
January 24, 2020 
After DOD and OMB responded to the 
President’s request, presumably with 
some of the information we just pro-
vided you, showing Europe gives a lot 
to Ukraine, nobody in the Trump ad-
ministration mentioned burden-sharing 
as a reason for the hold to any of the 17 
witnesses that we have been talking 
about. 
Sondland, whose actual portfolio is 
the EU—not Ukraine—testified that he 
was never asked to speak to the EU or 
EU member countries about providing 
more aid to Ukraine. If President 
Trump were truly concerned about 
that, he would have been the perfect 
guy to handle it because he was our 
Ambassador to the EU. But it never 
happened. How could it? Sondland him-
self knew the aid was linked to the in-
vestigations because that is what the 
President himself had told him. 
It 
wasn’t 
until 
the 
President’s 
scheme began to unravel, after the 
White House learned of the whistle-
blower complaint and after POLITICO 
publicly revealed the existence of the 
hold, that the issue of burden-sharing 
came up again. 
If the President’s concern were genu-
inely about burden-sharing, he never 
made any public statements about it, 
never ordered a review of burden-shar-
ing, and never ordered his officials to 
push Europe to increase their contribu-
tions. And then he released the aid 
without any changes in Europe’s con-
tributions. 
This last point is important. You 
know the President’s purported con-
cern about burden-sharing rings hollow 
because the aid was released after the 
President got caught, not because the 
EU or any European country made any 
new contributions. As Lieutenant Colo-
nel Vindman testified, the facts on the 
ground had not changed. 
Finally, you may hear the Presi-
dent’s counsel say that Ukraine didn’t 
know about the hold until August 28, 
long after the hold was implemented. 
Therefore, they could not have felt 
pressure. But this makes no sense. 
First, they found out about it long 
before August 28. Multiple witnesses 
testified that the Ukrainians showed 
‘‘impressive diplomatic tradecraft’’ in 
learning quickly about the hold, and, 
of course, they would know. The DOD 
release was announced in June. U.S. 
agencies knew about it in July. It 
should be no surprise that the first in-
quiries about the aid were on July 25, 
the same day as the call. 
You see, it doesn’t matter if extor-
tion lasts 2 weeks or 2 months. It is 
still extortion, and Ukraine certainly 
felt the pressure. Other Ukrainian offi-
cials also expressed concerns that the 
Ukrainian government was being sin-
gled out and penalized for some reason. 
And they were, by President Trump. 
Do you know how else you know they 
felt the pressure from the hold? Presi-
dent Zelensky finally relented and was 
planning to do the CNN interview. Ulti-
mately, right around the time of Presi-
dent 
Zelensky’s 
conversation 
with 
President Trump, which is the subject 
of the classified document that I urge 
all Senators to look at, President 
Zelensky canceled the CNN interview. 
But the damage was already done. 
The evidence is clear. The question 
for you is whether it is OK for the 
President to withhold taxpayer money, 
aid for our ally—our friend at war—for 
a personal political benefit; whether it 
was OK for the President to sacrifice 
our national security for his own elec-
tion. It is not OK to me, it is certainly 
not OK with the American people, and 
it should not be OK to any of you. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, President’s counsel, the Amer-
ican people, once again, we are gath-
ered here, not as Democrats or Repub-
licans, not as the left or the right, not 
as progressives or conservatives, but as 
Americans doing our constitutional 
duty during this moment of Presi-
dential accountability. As House man-
agers, we thank you for your courtesy, 
your attentiveness, and your hospi-
tality. 
At the heart of article II, obstruction 
of Congress, is a simple, troubling re-
ality. President Trump tried to cheat, 
he got caught, and then he worked hard 
to cover it up. The President tried to 
cheat, he got caught, and then he 
worked hard to cover it up. 
Patrick Henry, one the Nation’s 
great patriots, once said that ‘‘the lib-
erties of a people never were, nor ever 
will be secure, when the transactions of 
their rulers may be concealed from 
them.’’ 
Let’s now address the effort by Presi-
dent Trump and his team to cover up 
his wrongdoing. By July of 2019, White 
House officials were aware of serious 
allegations of misconduct by President 
Trump regarding Ukraine, but instead 
of halting the President’s corrupt 
scheme, they worked overtime to con-
ceal it from the American people. 
As additional evidence of the Presi-
dent’s 
wrongdoing 
mounted, 
White 
House lawyers redoubled their efforts 
to prevent Congress and the American 
people from learning of the President’s 
misconduct. 
At the same time, top administration 
officials—including Secretary of State 
Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Esper, 
and National Security Advisor John 
Bolton—tried to convince President 
Trump to lift the hold on the security 
assistance. 
They 
failed. 
President 
Trump was determined to carry out his 
corrupt scheme. 
The military and security aid was 
only released on September 11 after the 
hold became public, after the House 
launched an investigation, and after 
Congress learned about the existence of 
a whistleblower complaint. The $391 
million in security aid was only re-
leased because President Trump was 
caught redhanded. 
The actions of President Trump and 
high-level White House officials al-
lowed his abuse of power to continue 
beyond the watchful eye of Congress 
and, most importantly, the American 
people. 
As we have discussed at length, on 
July 10, Ambassador Sondland told the 
Ukrainians and other U.S. officials 
that he had a deal with Acting Chief of 
Staff Mick Mulvaney to schedule the 
White 
House 
meeting 
President 
Zelensky wanted, if the new Ukrainian 
leader committed to the phony inves-
tigations that President Trump sought. 
As you have seen in testimony shown 
during this trial, following that meet-
ing, National Security Council offi-
cials, Dr. Fiona Hill and LTC Alex-
ander Vindman immediately reported 
this information to John Eisenberg, 
the Legal Advisor for the National Se-
curity Council and a Deputy Counsel to 
the President. According to Dr. Hill, 
Mr. Eisenberg told her that he was also 
concerned about that July 10 meeting. 
On the screen is Dr. Hill’s deposition 
testimony where she explains Mr. 
Eisenberg’s reaction, saying: 
I mean, he wasn’t aware that Sondland, 
Ambassador Sondland was . . . kind of run-
ning around doing a lot of these . . . meet-
ings and independently. We talked about the 
fact that . . . Ambassador Sondland said he’d 
been meeting with Giuliani and he was very 
concerned about that. And he said he would 
follow up on this. 
Mr. Eisenberg was very concerned 
about that and said that he would fol-
low up on this. 
Dr. Hill further testified that Mr. 
Eisenberg told her that he followed up 
with his boss, the distinguished White 
House Counsel, Pat Cipollone. How-
ever, because the President blocked 
Mr. Eisenberg from testifying in the 
House, we do not know what, if any-
thing, he or Mr. Cipollone did in re-
sponse to this deeply troubling infor-
mation. What we do know is that 
President Trump’s effort to cheat con-
tinued with reckless abandon. By fail-
ing to put the brakes on the wrong-
doing after that July 10 meeting—even 
after they were notified by concerned 
national security officials—the White 
House attorneys allowed it to continue 
unchecked. 
Right around the same time that the 
July 10 meetings at the White House 
took place, the Office of Management 
and Budget began executing President 
Trump’s illegal order to withhold all 
security assistance from Ukraine. 
On July 10, Robert Blair, an assistant 
to the President, communicated the 
hold to the Acting Director of the Of-
fice of Management and Budget, Rus-
sell Vought. On July 18, an Office of 
Management and Budget official com-
municated the hold to other executive 
branch agencies, including the Depart-
ment of State and the Department of 
Defense. And a week later, on July 25, 
President Trump had his imperfect 
telephone call with President Zelensky 
and directly pressured the Ukrainian 
leader to commence phony political in-
vestigations as part of his effort to 
cheat and solicit foreign interference 
in the 2020 election. 
The July 25 call marked an impor-
tant turning point. If there was any

ficials and attorneys about whether 
President Trump was directly involved 
in the Ukraine scheme, as opposed to 
just a rogue operation being led by Ru-
dolph 
Giuliani 
or 
some 
other 
underlings, after July 25, there can be 
no mistake that the President of the 
United States was undoubtedly calling 
the shots. 
Thereafter, the complicity of White 
House officials with respect to the 
coverup of the President’s misconduct 
intensified. Immediately after the July 
25 
call, 
both 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman and his direct supervisor, 
Tim Morrison, reported their concerns 
about the call to Mr. Eisenberg and his 
Deputy, Michael Ellis. In fact, within 
an hour after the July 25 call, Lieuten-
ant Colonel Vindman returned again a 
second time to Mr. Eisenberg and re-
ported his concerns. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. I was concerned by the 
call. What I heard was inappropriate and I 
reported my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg. It is 
improper for the President of the United 
States to demand that a foreign government 
investigate a U.S. citizen and a political op-
ponent. 
I was also clear that if Ukraine pursued an 
investigation, it was also clear that if 
Ukraine pursued investigation into the 2016 
elections, the Bidens and Burisma, it would 
be interpreted as a partisan play. This would 
undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing bipar-
tisan support, undermining U.S. national se-
curity and advancing Russia’s strategic ob-
jectives in the region. 
I want to emphasize to the committee that 
when I reported my concerns on July 10th re-
lating to Ambassador Sondland and then on 
July 25th relating to the President, I did so 
out of a sense of duty. I privately reported 
my concerns in official channels to the prop-
er authority in the chain of command. My 
intent was to raise these concerns because 
they had significant national security impli-
cations for our country. I never thought that 
I’d be sitting here testifying in front of this 
committee and the American public about 
my actions. When I reported my concerns, 
my only thought was to act properly and to 
carry out my duty. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Timothy 
Morrison, the National Security Coun-
cil’s Senior Director for Europe and 
Russia, also reported the call to Mr. 
Eisenberg and asked him to review the 
call, which he feared would be ‘‘dam-
aging’’ if leaked. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Now, Mr. Morrison, short-
ly after you heard the July 25th call, you tes-
tified that you alerted the NSC legal advisor, 
John Eisenberg, pretty much right away. Is 
that right? 
Mr. MORRISON. Correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And you indicated in your 
opening statement, or at least from your 
deposition, that you went to Mr. Eisenberg 
out of concern over the potential political 
fallout if the call record became public and 
not because you thought it was illegal. Is 
that right? 
Mr. MORRISON. Correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. But you would agree, 
right, that asking a foreign government to 
investigate a domestic political rival is inap-
propriate. Would you not? 
Mr. MORRISON. It’s not what we rec-
ommended the President discuss. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The July 25 
call was at least the second time that 
National Security Council officials had 
reported 
concerns 
about 
President 
Trump’s pressure campaign to White 
House lawyers—the second time—who 
now clearly understood the gravity of 
the ongoing misconduct. 
But because the President blocked 
Mr. Eisenberg from testifying without 
any justification, the record is silent as 
to what, if any, actions he or the White 
House Counsel took to address Presi-
dent Trump’s brazen misconduct and 
abuse of power. We do know, however, 
that instead of trying to halt the 
scheme, White House lawyers facili-
tated it by taking affirmative steps to 
conceal evidence of President Trump’s 
misconduct. For example, after Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman and Mr. Mor-
rison reported their concerns related to 
the July 25 call to the National Secu-
rity Council lawyers, they tried to 
bury the call summary. They tried to 
bury it. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman 
testified that the National Security 
Council lawyers believed it was ‘‘appro-
priate to restrict access’’ to the call 
summary ‘‘for the purpose of the 
leaks’’ and ‘‘to preserv[e] the integ-
rity’’ of the transcript. 
According 
to 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman, Mr. Eisenberg ‘‘gave the go- 
ahead’’ to restrict access to the call 
summary. Mr. Morrison testified that 
he learned in late August, after he 
raised concerns that the call record 
might leak and be politically damaging 
to the President, that the call sum-
mary had been placed on a highly clas-
sified National Security Council serv-
er. The call record was placed on a 
server that is reserved for America’s 
most sensitive national security se-
crets and covert operations, not rou-
tine calls with foreign leaders. 
Apparently, Mr. Eisenberg claimed at 
the time that burying the call tran-
script on a highly classified server was 
a ‘‘mistake.’’ 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Now, in a second meeting 
with Mr. Eisenberg, what did you rec-
ommend that he do to prevent the call 
record from leaking? 
Mr. MORRISON. I recommended we re-
strict access to the package. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Had you ever asked the 
NSC legal advisor to restrict access before? 
Mr. MORRISON. No. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you speak to your su-
pervisor, Dr. Kupperman, before you went to 
speak to John Eisenberg? 
Mr. MORRISON. No. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you subsequently 
learn that the call record had been put in a 
highly classified system? 
Mr. MORRISON. I did. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And what reason did Mr. 
Eisenberg give you for why the call record 
was put in a highly classified system? 
Mr. MORRISON. It was a mistake. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. He said it was just a mis-
take? 
Mr. MORRISON. It was an administrative 
error. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In Mr. Mor-
rison’s view, the July 25 call record did 
not meet the requirements to be placed 
on a highly classified server. 
At his deposition, Mr. Morrison testi-
fied that the call record was placed on 
the server by ‘‘mistake.’’ However, 
even after this alleged ‘‘mistake’’ was 
discovered, the July 25 call summary 
was not removed from the classified 
system because someone was trying to 
hide it. It was not until a launch of the 
House impeachment inquiry in late 
September, and after intense public 
pressure, that the rough transcript of 
the July 25 call was released. 
Again, because Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. 
Ellis refused to testify in the House, we 
do not know exactly how the July 25 
call record ended up on this highly 
classified National Security Council 
server. What we do know is that Mr. 
Eisenberg ordered access restricted 
after multiple officials, like Dr. Fiona 
Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, 
advised him of the scheme to condition 
a White House meeting on phony polit-
ical investigations. They strongly sug-
gested there was an active attempt to 
conceal the clear evidence of the Presi-
dent’s wrongdoing. Instead of address-
ing the President’s misconduct, Mr. 
Eisenberg seemingly tried to cover it 
up. 
Why did Mr. Eisenberg place the July 
25 call summary on a server for highly 
classified material? Did anyone senior 
to Mr. Eisenberg direct him to hide the 
call record? Why did the call record re-
main on the classified server even after 
the so-called error was discovered? Who 
ordered the coverup of the call record? 
The American people deserve to know. 
Following the July 25 call, the Presi-
dent’s scheme to pressure Ukraine for 
political purposes intensified, appar-
ently unchecked by any effort to stop 
it from the White House Counsel’s Of-
fice. After the July 25 call, Ambas-
sadors Sondland and Volker worked 
with the President’s personal lawyer, 
Rudolph Giuliani, to procure a public 
statement from President Zelensky to 
announce phony investigations into 
Joe Biden and the CrowdStrike con-
spiracy theory being peddled by Presi-
dent Trump. At the same time, Presi-
dent Trump continued to withhold the 
White House meeting and security as-
sistance from Ukraine in a manner 
that broke the law. 
As these efforts were ongoing, White 
House attorneys reportedly received 
yet another warning sign that the 
President was abusing his power. Ac-
cording to a published report in the 
New York Times, the week after the 
July 25 call, an anonymous whistle-
blower reported concerns that the 
President was abusing his office for 
personal 
gain. 
The 
whistleblower’s 
complaint landed with the CIA’s Gen-
eral Counsel’s office. Although the con-
cerns related directly to the Presi-
dent’s own misconduct, the CIA’s Gen-
eral Counsel, Courtney Elwood, alerted 
Mr. Eisenberg. Over the next week, Ms. 
Elwood, Mr. Eisenberg, and their depu-
ties reportedly discussed the whistle-
blower’s concerns, and they deter-
mined, as required by law, that the al-
legations had a ‘‘reasonable basis.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S535 
January 24, 2020 
So, by early August, White House 
lawyers began working, along with the 
attorneys at the Department of Jus-
tice, to cover up the President’s wrong-
doing. They were determined to pre-
vent Congress and the American people 
from 
learning 
anything about the 
President’s corrupt behavior. Although 
senior Justice Department officials, in-
cluding Attorney General Bill Barr, 
were reportedly made aware of the con-
cerns about corrupt activity, no inves-
tigation into President Trump’s wrong-
doing was even opened by the DOJ. 
As White House and Justice Depart-
ment lawyers were discussing how to 
deal with the whistleblower’s concerns, 
on 
August 
12—another 
important 
date—the whistleblower filed a formal 
complaint with the inspector general 
for the intelligence community. 
In accordance with Federal law, on 
August 26, the inspector general trans-
mitted the whistleblower’s complaint 
to the Acting Director of National In-
telligence, Joseph Maguire, along with 
the inspector general’s preliminary 
conclusion that the complaint was 
both credible and related to a matter of 
urgent concern. Instead of transmit-
ting the whistleblower’s complaint to 
the House’s and Senate’s distinguished 
Intelligence Committees, as required 
by law, the Acting Director of National 
Intelligence notified the White House. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
The CHAIRMAN. I’m just trying to under-
stand the chronology. [So] you first went to 
the Office of Legal Counsel, and then you 
went to White House Counsel? 
MAGUIRE. We went to the—repeat that, 
please, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. I’m just trying to under-
stand the chronology. You first went to the 
Office of Legal Counsel, and then you went 
to the White House Counsel? 
MAGUIRE. No, no, no, sir. We went to the 
White House first to determine—to ask the 
question— 
The CHAIRMAN. That’s all I want to know 
is the chronology. So you went to the White 
House first. So you went to the subject of the 
complaint for advice first about whether you 
should provide the complaint to Congress? 
MAGUIRE. There were issues within this, a 
couple of things: One, it did appear that it 
has executive privilege. If it does have execu-
tive privilege, it is the White House that de-
termines that. I cannot determine that, as 
the Director of National Intelligence. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Under Fed-
eral law, the Acting Director of Na-
tional Intelligence was required to 
share the whistleblower’s complaint 
with Congress—period, full stop. If that 
had occurred, the President’s scheme 
to withhold security assistance and a 
White House meeting—being sought by 
the new Ukrainian leader—in order to 
pressure Ukraine for his own, personal 
political gain would have been exposed. 
To prevent that from happening, the 
President’s lawyers and top-level advis-
ers adopted a two-pronged coverup 
strategy: first, block Congress and the 
American people from learning about 
the whistleblower’s complaint; second, 
try to convince President Trump to lift 
the hold on the security assistance be-
fore anyone could find out about it and 
use that evidence against him. 
As to the first prong, sometime after 
the Acting Director of National Intel-
ligence told the White House Counsel’s 
Office about the complaint on August 
26, Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Eisenberg re-
portedly briefed the President. They 
likely discussed with President Trump 
whether they were legally required to 
give the complaint to Congress. They 
stated that they were consulting with 
the Office of Legal Counsel at the De-
partment of Justice. The Acting Direc-
tor of National Intelligence testified 
that he and the inspector general con-
sulted with the Office of Legal Counsel, 
which opined without any reasonable 
basis that he did not have to turn over 
the complaint to Congress. 
On September 3—the day after the 
statutory deadline for the Director of 
National Intelligence to provide the 
complaint to this body and to the 
House—the Office of Legal Counsel 
issued a secret opinion, concluding 
that, contrary to the plain language of 
the statute, the Acting Director of Na-
tional Intelligence was not required to 
turn over the complaint. The coverup 
was in full swing. 
The Office of Legal Counsel opined 
that the whistleblower’s complaint did 
not qualify as an urgent concern and 
therefore did not have to be turned 
over. What could be more urgent than 
a sitting President’s trying to cheat in 
an American election by soliciting for-
eign interference? What could be more 
urgent than that? That is a constitu-
tional crime in progress, but they con-
cluded it was not an urgent matter. 
Acting Director of National Intel-
ligence Maguire testified that the Of-
fice of Legal Counsel’s opinion did not 
actually prevent him from turning over 
the complaint to Congress. Instead, 
based upon his testimony, it is clear 
that he withheld it on the basis that 
the complaint might deal with infor-
mation he believed could be covered by 
executive 
privilege, 
but 
President 
Trump never actually invoked execu-
tive privilege. He never actually in-
voked executive privilege, nor did he 
inform Congress that he was doing so 
with respect to this complaint. Instead, 
the White House secretly instructed 
the Acting Director of National Intel-
ligence to withhold the complaint 
based on the mere possibility that ex-
ecutive privilege could be invoked. By 
doing so, the White House was able to 
keep the explosive complaint from 
Congress and the American public 
without ever having to disclose the 
reason it was withholding this informa-
tion. 
But truth crushed to the ground will 
rise again. There is a toxic mess at 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue, and I humbly 
suggest that it is our collective job, on 
behalf of the American people, to try 
to clean it up. President Trump tried 
to cheat. He got caught. Then he 
worked hard to cover it up. 
There have been many great Presi-
dents throughout the history of this 
Republic—great Republican Presidents 
and great Democratic Presidents. Per-
haps one of the greatest Presidents was 
Abraham Lincoln. He once said that 
any man can handle adversity, but if 
you want to test a man’s character, 
give him some power. 
America is a great nation. We can 
handle adversity better than any other 
country in the world. Whenever Amer-
ica has found itself in a tough spot, we 
have always made it to the other side. 
We were in a tough spot during the 
Civil War, when America was at risk of 
tearing itself apart, but we made it to 
the other side. We were in a tough spot 
in October of 1929, when the stock mar-
ket collapsed, plunging us into the 
Great Depression, but we made it to 
the other side. We were in a tough spot 
in December of 1941, when a foreign 
power struck, plunging us into a great 
conflict with the evil empire of Nazi 
Germany, but America made it to the 
other side. We were in a tough spot in 
the 1960s when dealing with the inher-
ent contradictions of Jim Crow, but we 
made it to the other side. We were in a 
tough spot on September 11, when the 
Towers were struck and when young 
men and women, like JASON
CROW, 
were sent to Afghanistan to fight the 
terrorists there so we didn’t have to 
fight the terrorists here, and we made 
it to the other side. 
America is a great country. We can 
handle adversity better than any other 
nation in the world, but what are we 
going to do about our character? 
President Trump tried to cheat and 
solicit foreign interference in an Amer-
ican election. That is an attack on our 
character. President Trump abused his 
power and corrupted the highest office 
in the land. That is an attack on our 
character. President Trump tried to 
cover it all up and hide it from Amer-
ica and obstruct Congress. That is an 
extraordinary attack on our character. 
America is a great nation. We can 
handle adversity better than any other 
country in the world, but what are we 
going to do about our character? 
Mr. Manager CROW. As the crisis 
around the President’s hold deepened 
throughout our government, the Presi-
dent’s own top advisers redoubled their 
efforts to lift the hold on military aid 
and stem the fallout in case it went 
public, and it did go public. On August 
28, POLITICO publicly reported that 
the President was withholding the 
military aid. 
As you have heard, the public disclo-
sure of the President’s hold in late Au-
gust caused deep alarm among Ukrain-
ian officials. It also caused U.S. offi-
cials to redouble their efforts once 
again. 
At the end of August, Secretary of 
State 
Pompeo, 
Defense 
Secretary 
Esper, and Ambassador Bolton report-
edly tried to convince President Trump 
to release the military aid, but they 
failed. The President wanted the hold 
to remain. That prompted Duffey, the 
political appointee charged with imple-
menting the hold, to send an email on 
August 30 to the DOD, stating: ‘‘Clear 
direction from POTUS to hold.’’ This is

consistent with Laura Cooper’s deposi-
tion testimony, when she said that 
they were ‘‘hopeful this whole time 
that Secretary Esper and Secretary 
Pompeo would be able to meet with the 
President and just explain to him why 
this was so important and get the funds 
released,’’ but, instead, the President 
held firm. 
Even as the President’s own Cabinet 
officials were trying to convince him 
to lift the hold, White House lawyers 
were receiving new reports about the 
President’s abuse. 
On 
September 
1, 
Vice 
President 
PENCE met with President Zelensky in 
Warsaw, 
and 
immediately 
after, 
Sondland had a side conversation with 
the top Ukrainian Presidential aide. 
Morrison was privy to these conversa-
tions, and when he returned from War-
saw, he reported to Eisenberg the de-
tails. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And what did Ambassador 
Sondland tell you that he told Mr. Yermak? 
Mr. MORRISON. That the Ukrainians 
would have to have the prosecutor general 
make a statement with respect to the inves-
tigations as a condition of having the aid 
lifted. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And you testified that you 
were not comfortable with what Ambassador 
Sondland had told you. Why not? 
Mr. MORRISON. Well, I was concerned 
about what I saw as essentially an additional 
hurdle to accomplishing what I had been di-
rected to help accomplish, which was giving 
the President the information that he needed 
to determine that the security sector assist-
ance could go forward. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. So now there’s a whole 
other wrinkle to it, right? 
Mr. MORRISON. There was the appearance 
of one, based on what Ambassador Sondland 
represented. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And you told Ambassador 
Taylor about this conversation as well. Is 
that right? 
Mr. MORRISON. I promptly reached out to 
Ambassador Taylor to schedule a secure 
phone call. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And in your deposition, 
you testified that his testimony, other than 
one small distinction between President 
Zelensky and the prosecutor general, was ac-
curate as to what you told him. Is that cor-
rect? 
Mr. MORRISON. About that conversation, 
yes. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And, generally speaking, 
you confirmed everything that Ambassador 
Taylor told you, except for that one thing 
and a small other ministerial matter relat-
ing to the location of the meeting. Is that 
correct? 
Mr. MORRISON. Correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Now, did you tell Ambas-
sador Bolton about this conversation as 
well? 
Mr. MORRISON. I have reached out to him 
as well and requested his availability for a 
secure phone call. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And what was his response 
when you explained to him what Ambassador 
Sondland had said? 
Mr. MORRISON. Tell the lawyers. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you go tell the law-
yers? 
Mr. MORRISON. When I returned to the 
States, yes. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And did he explain to you 
why he wanted you to tell the lawyers? 
Mr. MORRISON. He did not. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Now, this wasn’t 
the first time—and it wouldn’t be the 
last—that 
Ambassador 
Bolton 
in-
structed other government officials to 
report 
details 
of 
the 
President’s 
scheme to White House lawyers. 
Now, let’s be clear. When government 
employees have concerns about wheth-
er something is legal, they often go to 
their agency’s lawyers. And it was hap-
pening an awful lot around this time. 
Recall that Bolton also instructed Dr. 
Hill 
to 
report 
to 
the 
lawyers 
Sondland’s statements about requiring 
an announcement of the investigations 
as a condition for a White House meet-
ing—what Bolton called Sondland’s 
‘‘drug deal’’ with the President’s top 
aide, 
Mick 
Mulvaney. 
Ambassador 
Bolton’s testimony would obviously 
shine further light on these concerns 
and what or who, if anyone, in the 
White House or the Cabinet did to try 
to stop the President at this time. 
After the President’s hold on mili-
tary aid became public in late August, 
there was increasing pressure on the 
President to lift the hold. On Sep-
tember 3, a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators sent a letter to Acting White 
House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. 
An excerpt from that letter is in front 
of you. The Senators expressed ‘‘deep 
concerns’’ that the ‘‘Administration is 
considering not obligating the Ukraine 
Security Initiative funds for 2019.’’ The 
Senators’ letter also urged that the 
‘‘vital’’ funds be obligated ‘‘imme-
diately.’’ 
On September 5, the chairman and 
the ranking member of the House For-
eign Affairs Committee sent a joint 
letter to Mulvaney and OMB Director 
Russell Vought. That letter also ex-
pressed ‘‘deep concern’’ about the con-
tinuing hold on the military aid. 
The same day, Senators MURPHY and 
JOHNSON
visited Kyiv and met with 
President Zelensky, along with Ambas-
sador Taylor. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. On September 5th, I 
accompanied Senators JOHNSON and MURPHY 
during their visit to Kyiv. When we met with 
President Zelensky, his first question to the 
Senators was about the withheld security as-
sistance. My recollection of the meeting is 
that both Senators stressed that bipartisan 
support for Ukraine in Washington was 
Ukraine’s most important strategic asset 
and that President Zelensky should not jeop-
ardize that bipartisan support by getting 
drawn in to U.S. domestic politics. 
I had been making and continue to make 
this point to all of my official Ukrainian 
contacts. But the odd push to make Presi-
dent Zelensky publicly commit to investiga-
tions of Burisma and alleged interference in 
the 2016 election showed how the official for-
eign policy of the United States was under-
cut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. 
Giuliani. 
Mr. Manager CROW. The Senators 
sought to reassure President Zelensky 
that there was bipartisan support in 
Congress for providing the military 
aid. 
Also on September 5, the Washington 
Post editorial board reported concerns 
that President Trump was withholding 
the aid and a meeting to force Presi-
dent Zelensky to announce investiga-
tions to benefit his personal political 
campaign. 
The editors wrote: 
‘‘[W]e are reliably told that the President 
has a second and more venal agenda: He is 
attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to inter-
vene in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election by 
launching an investigation of the leading 
Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump 
is not just soliciting Ukraine’s help with his 
Presidential campaign; he is using U.S. mili-
tary aid the country desperately needs in an 
attempt to extort it. 
Despite these efforts to get the Presi-
dent to lift the hold and the now-public 
discussion about the President’s abuse 
of power, the scheme continued. Two 
days later, on September 7, Morrison 
went back to the White House lawyers 
to report additional details he had 
learned from Ambassador Sondland 
about the President’s scheme—again, 
at the direction of Ambassador Bolton. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Now, a few days later, on 
September 7th, you spoke again to Ambas-
sador Sondland, who told you that he had 
just gotten off the phone with President 
Trump. Isn’t that right? 
Mr. MORRISON. That sounds correct, yes. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What did Ambassador 
Sondland tell you that President Trump said 
to him? 
Mr. MORRISON. If I recall this conversa-
tion correctly, this was where Ambassador 
Sondland related that there was no quid pro 
quo, but President Zelensky had to make the 
statement and that he had to want to do it. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And by that point, did you 
understand that the statement related to the 
Biden and 2016 investigations? 
Mr. MORRISON. I think I did, yes. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And that that was essen-
tially a condition for the security assistance 
to be released? 
Mr. MORRISON. I understood that that’s 
what Ambassador Sondland believed. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. After speaking with Presi-
dent Trump? 
Mr. MORRISON. That’s what he rep-
resented. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Now, you testified that 
hearing this information gave you a sinking 
feeling. Why was that? 
Mr. MORRISON. Well, I believe if we’re on 
September 7th, the end of the fiscal year is 
September 30th, these are 1 year dollars, the 
DOD and the Department of State funds, so 
we only had so much time. And, in fact, be-
cause Congress imposed a 15 day notification 
requirement on the State Department funds, 
September 7th, September 30th, that really 
means September 15th in order to secure a 
decision from the President to allow the 
funds to go forward. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you tell Ambassador 
Bolton about this conversation as well? 
Mr. MORRISON. I did. I did, yes. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And what did he say to 
you? 
Mr. MORRISON. He said to tell the law-
yers. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And why did he say to tell 
the lawyers? 
Mr. MORRISON. He did not explain his di-
rection. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Again, ‘‘tell the 
lawyers.’’ 
Ambassador 
Sondland’s 
call 
with 
President Trump on September 7 also 
prompted deep concern by Ambassador 
Taylor, which you have already heard 
about.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S537 
January 24, 2020 
On September 8 and 9, Ambassador 
Taylor exchanged WhatsApp messages 
with 
Ambassadors 
Sondland 
and 
Volker, describing his ‘‘nightmare’’ 
scenario that ‘‘they give the interview 
and don’t get the security assistance.’’ 
He then goes on to say: ‘‘The Russians 
love it. (And I quit.)’’ 
After the hold on the military aid be-
came public, the White House took two 
actions in early September. 
First, the White House and the Jus-
tice Department ensured that the Act-
ing DNI continued to withhold the 
whistleblower complaint from Con-
gress, in clear violation of the law. 
And second, the White House at-
tempted to create a cover story for the 
President’s withholding of the assist-
ance. 
Approximately 2 months after Presi-
dent Trump had ordered the freeze, 
Mark Sandy received an email from his 
boss, Michael Duffey that, for the first 
time, gave a reason for the hold. Sandy 
testified that in early September he re-
ceived an email from Duffey ‘‘that at-
tributed the hold to the President’s 
concern about other countries not con-
tributing more to Ukraine.’’ 
Again, after months of scrambling, 
this was the first time any reason had 
been provided for the hold. 
And according to Sandy, it was also 
only in early September—again, after 
the White House learned of the whistle-
blower complaint and the hold became 
public—that the White House requested 
data from OMB on other countries’ as-
sistance to Ukraine. 
So let’s recap why we know the con-
cern about burden-sharing was bogus. 
First, for months, no reason was given 
to the very people executing the mili-
tary aid who had been actively search-
ing for answers about why the aid was 
being held. 
Second, 
remember 
the 
supposed 
interagency 
process 
performed 
by 
OMB? Well, it was fake. 
And third, after the hold went public 
and the White House became aware of 
the whistleblower, they started scram-
bling to develop another excuse. Public 
reports confirm this. 
A November 24 news report, for in-
stance, revealed that in September, Mr. 
Cipollone’s lawyers conducted an inter-
nal records review. The review report-
edly ‘‘turned up hundreds of documents 
that reveal extensive efforts to gen-
erate an after-the-fact justification for 
the decision and a debate over whether 
the delay was legal.’’ 
The President’s top aides were trying 
to convince the President to lift the 
hold in late August and early Sep-
tember, and White House officials were 
actively working to develop an excuse 
for the President’s scheme and devise a 
cover story in the event it was exposed, 
and soon it would be. 
On September 9, the chairs of the 
House 
Intelligence 
Committee, 
the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform 
publicly announced a joint investiga-
tion of President Trump and Mr. 
Giuliani’s scheme. And this is when the 
music stops and everyone starts run-
ning to find a chair. 
Word of the committees’ investiga-
tion spread quickly through the White 
House to the NSC. Morrison recalled 
seeing and discussing the letter with 
NSC 
staff. 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman 
also 
recalled 
discussions 
among NSC staff members, including 
Morrison’s deputy, John Erath, about 
the investigation. 
The same day, there were efforts at 
OMB to create a paper trail to try to 
shift the blame for the President’s hold 
on security assistance away from the 
White House. Duffey sent an email to 
Elaine McCusker that contradicted 
months of email exchanges and stated 
falsely 
that 
OMB 
had 
in 
fact 
‘‘authoriz[ed] DOD to proceed with all 
processes necessary to obligate funds.’’ 
Duffey was attempting to shift all the 
responsibility for the delay onto the 
Pentagon. 
McCusker 
replied: 
‘‘You 
can’t be serious. I am speechless.’’ 
Now, all of this—including OMB’s ef-
forts to shift blame to the Pentagon, 
the White House’s effort to create a 
cover story for the hold on security as-
sistance—was a continuation of the 
coverup. 
It started with the White House law-
yers’ failure to stop the scheme after 
the July 10 meeting was reported to 
them, continued with attempts to hide 
the July 25 call summary, and esca-
lated with the White House’s illegal 
concealment of the whistleblower com-
plaint from Congress. 
On September 10, the House Intel-
ligence Committee requested that the 
DNI provide a copy of the whistle-
blower complaint as the law requires. 
But DNI continued to withhold the 
complaint for weeks. 
The same day, it was announced that 
Ambassador Bolton was resigning or 
had been fired. It is unclear whether 
Ambassador Bolton’s departure from 
the White House had anything to do 
with his opposition to the hold on mili-
tary aid, but, of course, Ambassador 
Bolton could shed light on that himself 
if he were to testify. 
The next day, on September 11, Presi-
dent Trump met with Vice President 
PENCE, 
Mulvaney, 
and 
Senator 
PORTMAN to discuss the hold. Later 
that day, the President relented and 
lifted the hold after his scheme had 
been exposed. 
The President’s decision to release 
the aid, like his decision to impose the 
hold, was never explained. Cooper testi-
fied that President Trump’s lifting of 
the hold ‘‘really came out of the blue. 
. . . It was quite abrupt.’’ 
The only logical conclusion, based 
upon all of this evidence, is that the 
President lifted the hold on September 
11 because he got caught. 
The President’s decision to lift the 
hold without any explanation is also 
very telling. If the hold was put in 
place for legitimate policy reasons, 
why lift it arbitrarily with no expla-
nation? 
By lifting the hold only after Con-
gress had launched an investigation— 
when, as Lieutenant Colonel Vindman 
testified, none of the ‘‘facts on the 
ground’’ had changed since the hold 
had been put in place—the President 
was conceding that there was never a 
legitimate purpose. 
Since the hold was lifted, the Presi-
dent has paid lip service to purported 
concerns about corruption and burden- 
sharing. But the administration has 
taken no concrete steps before or since 
those statements were made to show 
that it really cares. 
The record is clear. Before he got 
caught, the President had no interest 
in anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine. 
And, as you have already learned, 
those people who really were concerned 
about these issues—like Congress, this 
Senate, the DOD, and the State De-
partment—had already gone through 
the process to address them. 
As Ambassador Sondland testified, at 
no point did the President ask him to 
discuss 
additional 
contributions 
to 
Ukraine from the EU countries, nor did 
President Trump push Ukraine to un-
dertake any specific anti-corruption 
reforms. 
Now, the President’s counsel will 
likely say that his lifting of the hold 
shows his good faith. They will say 
that because Ukraine ultimately re-
ceived 
the 
aid 
without 
President 
Zelensky having to announce the sham 
investigations, then there was no abuse 
of power. As a legal matter, the fact 
that the President’s corrupt scheme 
was not fully successful makes no dif-
ference. Trump’s abuse occurred at the 
moment he used the power of the Presi-
dency to assist his reelection cam-
paign, undermining our free and fair 
elections and our national security. 
But, importantly, President Trump 
almost did get away with it. As dis-
cussed 
earlier, 
President 
Zelensky 
agreed during his September phone call 
with Ambassador Sondland to do a 
CNN interview during which he would 
announce the investigations. On Sep-
tember 12, Ambassador Taylor person-
ally informed President Zelensky and 
the Ukrainian Foreign Minister that 
President Trump’s hold on military as-
sistance had been lifted. On September 
13, 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
and 
David 
Holmes met with President Zelensky 
and his advisers and urged them not to 
go forward with the CNN interview. 
It was not until September 18 and 
19—around the time that President 
Zelensky spoke with Vice President 
PENCE—that the Ukrainians finally 
canceled the CNN interview. 
The President has also repeatedly 
pointed to President Zelensky’s public 
statements that he did not feel pres-
sured by Trump. Not only unsurprising, 
it is also irrelevant. The question is 
whether President Trump used the 
power of the Presidency to coerce 
President Zelensky into helping him 
win a political campaign. 
But 
we 
know 
that 
President 
Zelensky was pressured. He kept delay-
ing and delaying because he did not

January 24, 2020 
want to be a pawn in U.S. domestic pol-
itics. 
In fact, President Zelensky remains 
under pressure to this day. As Holmes 
testified, there are still things the 
Ukrainians want and need from the 
United States, including a meeting 
with the President in the Oval Office, 
which has still not been scheduled. And 
yes, Ukraine remains at war and needs 
U.S. military aid, including aid that is 
still delayed from last year. For these 
reasons, Mr. Holmes explained: 
I think [the Ukrainians are] being very 
careful. They still need us now going for-
ward. In fact, right now President Zelensky 
is trying to arrange a summit meeting with 
President Putin in the coming weeks, his 
first face-to-face meeting with him to try to 
advance the peace process. 
He needs our support. He needs—he needs 
President Putin to understand that America 
supports Zelensky at the highest levels. So 
this doesn’t end with the lifting of security 
assistance hold. Ukraine still needs us, and 
as I said, still fighting this war this very 
day. 
When President Trump, for his own 
personal political gain, asked for a 
favor from President Zelensky, he did 
exactly what the Framers feared most: 
He invited the influence of a foreign 
power into our elections. He used the 
power of his office to secure that ad-
vantage and jeopardized our national 
security. 
Yet President Trump maintains that 
he was always in the right and that his 
July 25 call with President Zelensky 
was ‘‘perfect.’’ President Trump has 
made it clear that he believes he is free 
to use his powers the same way, to the 
same ends, whenever and wherever he 
pleases. Even more troubling, he is 
even doubling down on his abuse, invit-
ing other countries to interfere in our 
elections. 
What does all of this tell you? It tells 
you that Ambassador Sondland was 
correct when he told Holmes after 
hanging up with President Trump on 
July 26 that the President doesn’t care 
about Ukraine. He only cares about the 
‘‘big stuff,’’ meaning stuff that helps 
him personally. 
The bottom line is that the President 
used the powers of his office for per-
sonal political gain. He did so know-
ingly, deliberately, and repeatedly, and 
his misconduct continues to this day. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, just 
for your orientation, this will be the 
last presentation on article I, and, Mr. 
Leader, I think at the conclusion of 
this presentation would be a logical 
point to take a break. 
This last section on article I deals 
with the injury to our national inter-
ests and our national security. 
When 
President 
Trump 
used 
Ukraine’s leader for a political favor 
and withheld critical military aid to an 
ally in exchange for that favor, he did 
exactly what our Framers feared most: 
He invited foreign interference in our 
elections and sold out our country’s se-
curity for his personal benefit and be-
trayed the Nation’s trust to a foreign 
power. 
The President’s scheme to pressure 
Ukraine to do his political dirty work 
harmed our national security, under-
mined our free and fair elections, and 
even today—even today—threatens the 
very foundation of our democracy. 
When the President argues that his 
call was ‘‘perfect,’’ that he did nothing 
wrong, what he is really saying is that 
there is nothing wrong with a Presi-
dent asking a foreign government to do 
a personal favor, that there is nothing 
wrong with the President pressuring 
that foreign country to interfere in our 
elections for his personal benefit, that 
there is nothing wrong with with-
holding congressionally appropriated 
taxpayer-funded military assistance to 
that foreign country to extort that 
country to help the President cheat to 
win an election. 
But there are a great many things 
wrong with that. Most significant for 
the purposes that bring us here today, 
the Constitution does not permit it. 
The Constitution does not permit it be-
cause that conduct is the quintessen-
tial abuse of power—the use of official 
power for personal gain, putting per-
sonal interests over the national inter-
ests, and placing personal benefits over 
our Nation’s security. 
The President’s conduct that we out-
lined yesterday harmed our national 
security. That is without a doubt. It 
endangered our elections and it has 
sent our country on a dangerous path 
that if left unchecked will cause irrev-
ocable damage to the balance of power 
contemplated in our Constitution. If 
someone sacrifices the national inter-
est in favor of his own and is not re-
moved from office, our democracy is in 
jeopardy. It is just that simple. 
The grave consequences of President 
Trump’s misconduct demand our atten-
tion. Let me take these issues in turn, 
beginning with this harm to national 
security. 
First, the President’s abuse of power 
had immediate consequences to our se-
curity. Ukraine is a burgeoning democ-
racy entangled in a hot war with Rus-
sia. By withholding military aid, Presi-
dent Trump not only denied Ukraine 
much-needed military equipment but 
also weakened Ukraine’s position in 
negotiations over the end of the war 
with Russia. Because of President 
Trump’s 
corrupt 
actions, 
Vladimir 
Putin was emboldened at a pivotal mo-
ment ahead of those sensitive negotia-
tions to attempt to end the war. An 
emboldened Russia is a threat to the 
United States and global security 
around the world. 
The President’s willingness to put 
himself over country undercut our Eu-
ropean allies’ confidence in America’s 
commitment to deterring Russian ag-
gression, and it signaled to adversaries 
and friends alike that the President of 
the United States, the most powerful 
man in the world, our Commander in 
Chief, could be influenced by manipu-
lating his perception of what was best 
for his personal interests. 
Now, I have no doubt that the Rus-
sians, and probably every other nation 
that has the capacity, does a psycho-
logical profile of the President of the 
United States, as we profile other lead-
ers. If a President can be so easily ma-
nipulated to disbelieve his own intel-
ligence agencies, to accept the propa-
ganda of the Kremlin, that is a threat 
to our national security. That is just 
what has happened here, but that is not 
all. 
President Trump’s willingness to en-
tangle our foreign allies in a corrupt 
political errand also undermined the 
credibility of Americans to promote 
the rule of law and fight corruption 
abroad. 
This is ‘‘Trump first,’’ not ‘‘America 
first,’’ not American ideals first. And 
the result has and will continue to be 
great harm to our Nation if this Cham-
ber does not stand up and say it is 
wrong, if you do not stand up and say 
this is not only wrong, not only unac-
ceptable 
but 
conduct 
incompatible 
with the Office of the Presidency. If it 
really is incompatible with the Office 
of the Presidency, if you cannot faith-
fully execute that responsibility, if you 
cannot bring yourself to put your Na-
tion’s interests ahead of your own, it 
must be impeachable, for the Nation 
remains at risk. 
Let’s consider the big picture, and 
probably 
a 
question 
many 
people 
around the country are asking: Why 
does Ukraine matter to the United 
States? Why does Ukraine matter to 
the United States? Because we are 
talking about a small country that 
many people know very little about. 
Well, this small country, this ally of 
ours, is a country hungry for reform 
and eager for a stronger relation with 
its most powerful, important ally, the 
United States. We are talking about 
ourselves and what it means to the 
strength of our own democracy and de-
mocracies around the world when coun-
tries like Ukraine are fighting our 
fight against authoritarianism. It used 
to be our fight, and God help us if it is 
not our fight still. 
Russian President Putin declared the 
collapse of the Soviet Union to be the 
greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 
20th century. Ukraine’s vote for inde-
pendence in December 1991 was the 
final nail in the Soviet Union’s coffin. 
That made Ukraine’s greatest moment 
Putin’s greatest tragedy. 
When it declared independence from 
Soviet domination, Ukraine inherited 
roughly 1,900 Soviet nuclear warheads, 
enough firepower to level every major 
American city several times over—1,900 
Soviet nuclear warheads. In exchange 
for Ukraine’s surrendering this arsenal, 
the United States, Russia, and the 
United Kingdom reached an under-
standing called the Budapest Memo-
randum of 1994. They committed in this 
memorandum to respecting the borders 
of an independent Ukraine and also to 
refrain from using the threat or use of 
force against Ukraine. This was an 
early success of the post-Cold War pe-
riod.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S539 
January 24, 2020 
Despite its commitment to respect 
Ukraine’s independence, of course, Rus-
sia continued to meddle in Ukraine’s 
affairs. Ambassador Taylor recounted 
how events took an even more sinister 
turn in 2013: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. In 2013, Vladimir 
Putin was so threatened by the prospect of 
Ukraine joining the European Union that he 
tried to bribe the Ukrainian President. This 
triggered mass protests in the winter of 2013 
that drove that President to flee to Russia in 
February of 2014, but not before his forces 
killed 100 Ukrainian protesters in central 
Kyiv. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Angered by 
the fall of the Kremlin-backed leader 
in Kyiv, President Putin ordered the 
invasion of Ukraine—specifically, a re-
gion known as Crimea. Russia’s aggres-
sion was met with global condemna-
tion. 
(Videotape presentation.) 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We don’t have 
the sound there, but you can see the 
images of that conflict on the screens 
before you. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of De-
fense Laura Cooper testified as to the 
stakes for U.S. national security: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. COOPER. Russia violated the sov-
ereignty of Ukraine’s territory. Russia ille-
gally annexed territory that belonged to 
Ukraine. They also denied Ukraine access to 
its naval fleet at the time. And to this day, 
Russia is building a capability on Crimea de-
signed to expand Russian military power 
projection far beyond the immediate region. 
Ms. CARSON. In 2014, were there concerns 
in Washington, here in Washington, and Eu-
ropean capitals that Russia might not stop 
in Ukraine? 
Ms. COOPER. I was not in my current posi-
tion in 2014, but it is my understanding that 
there was significant fear about where Rus-
sian aggression would stop. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. One Amer-
ican—a war hero and statesman who 
was no stranger to this body—recog-
nized the threat posed by Russia’s in-
vasion 
of 
Crimea: 
Senator 
John 
McCain. 
In an interview, he declared: ‘‘We are 
all Ukrainians.’’ Senator McCain ad-
vised that this is a chess match remi-
niscent of the Cold War, and we need to 
realize that and act accordingly. He 
was, of course, absolutely right. 
Consistent with the commitments 
made to Ukraine in 1994, the United 
States and Europe responded to Rus-
sia’s invasion by imposing significant 
sanctions on Russia. We joined Europe 
in providing Ukraine billions of dollars 
in economic support to help it resist 
Russian influence, and the Senate ap-
proved, by an overwhelming bipartisan 
majority, vital security assistance to 
help rebuild Ukraine’s military, which 
the former Russian-backed leader of 
Ukraine had starved of resources. 
This strong bipartisan support for 
Ukraine 
reflected 
what 
Senator 
McCain said was an opportunity for the 
United States to undermine Russian le-
verage in Eastern Europe by building a 
‘‘success’’ in Ukraine. Senator McCain 
outlined this vision: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
JOHN MCCAIN. . . . Putin also sees—here’s 
this beautiful and large and magnificent 
country 
called 
Ukraine. 
And 
suppose 
Ukraine, finally, after failing in 2004, gets it 
right, democracy, gets rid of corruption, 
economy is really improving and it’s right 
there on the border of Russia. And so I think 
it makes him very nervous if there were a 
success in Ukraine in bringing about a free 
and open society and economic success, 
which is not the case in Russia, as you know, 
which is propped up by energy. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Achieving the 
Ukrainian 
success 
that 
Senator 
McCain and many of us hoped for 
proved to be a daunting task, but sev-
eral witnesses who testified before the 
House said Volodymyr Zelensky’s land-
slide election in April 2019 was a game 
changer. Here is how U.S. diplomat 
David Holmes explained the ‘‘historic 
opportunity’’ created by his election: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
DAVID HOLMES. Despite the Russian ag-
gression, over the past 5 years, Ukrainians 
have rebuilt a shattered economy, adhered to 
a peace process, and moved economically and 
socially closer to the West, toward our way 
of life. 
Earlier this year, large majorities of 
Ukrainians again chose a fresh start by vot-
ing for a political newcomer as President, re-
placing 80 percent of their parliament, en-
dorsing a platform consistent with our demo-
cratic values, our reform priorities, and our 
strategic interests. 
This year’s revolution at the ballot box un-
derscores that, despite its imperfections, 
Ukraine is a genuine and vibrant democracy 
and an example to other post-Soviet coun-
tries and beyond, from Moscow to Hong 
Kong. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So American 
support for Ukraine’s security and re-
form is critical not only to our own na-
tional security but to other allies and 
emerging 
democracies 
around 
the 
world. The widely accepted fact of 
Ukraine’s importance to our national 
security 
makes 
President 
Trump’s 
abuse of power and withholding of vital 
diplomatic and military support all the 
more disturbing. 
First, witnesses assessed that with-
holding the military aid likely helped 
to prolong the war against Russia. 
When wars drag on, more people die. 
Ambassador Taylor testified to this 
sober reality. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
The CHAIRMAN. I take it, if the provision 
of the U.S. military assistance would save 
Ukrainian lives, that any delay in that as-
sistance may also cost Ukrainian lives. Is 
that true? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Chairman, of course 
it’s hard to draw any direct lines between 
any particular element of security assistance 
and any particular death on the battlefield. 
But it is certainly true that that assistance 
had enabled Ukrainian Armed Forces to be 
effective and deter and to be able to take 
countermeasures to the attacks that the 
Russians had— 
The CHAIRMAN. I think you said that a 
Ukrainian soldier lost their life while you 
were visiting Donbas. 
Ambassador TAYLOR. We keep very care-
ful track of the casualties. And I noticed, on 
the next day, the information that we got, 
that one was killed, four soldiers were 
wounded on that day. 
The CHAIRMAN. And, indeed, Ukrainians 
lose their lives every week. 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Every week. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. David Holmes 
also testified that prolonging the war 
in Ukraine resulted in additional cas-
ualties. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
DAVID HOLMES. As we sit here today, 
Ukrainians are fighting a hot war on Ukrain-
ian territory against Russian aggression. 
This week alone, since I have been here in 
Washington, two Ukrainian soldiers were 
killed and two injured by Russian-led forces 
in eastern Ukraine despite a declared cease- 
fire. I learned overnight that seven more 
were injured yesterday. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Withholding 
the aid has real consequences to real 
soldiers with real families. Bear in 
mind that U.S. aid is fully 10 percent of 
Ukraine’s defense budget—10 percent. 
That is not an extra bonus. That is nec-
essary aid for Ukraine to defend itself 
on the frontline. 
Now, a second consequence of Presi-
dent Trump’s withholding of military 
assistance was that it emboldened Rus-
sia, our adversary. Here is Laura Coo-
per, a Pentagon official, who oversaw 
the military aid. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. CARSON. So what about today? If the 
U.S. were to withdraw its military support of 
Ukraine, what would effectively happen? 
Ms. COOPER. It is my belief that, if we 
were to withdraw our support, it would em-
bolden Russia. It would also validate Rus-
sia’s violation of international law. 
Mr. CARSON. And which country stands to 
benefit the most—would stand to benefit the 
most from such a withdrawal? 
Ms. COOPER. Russia. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Russia was not 
only emboldened on the battlefield. 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
testified 
that 
President Trump’s corrupt withholding 
of military assistance and his failure to 
host President Zelensky in the Oval Of-
fice was a ‘‘sign of weakness’’ to Mos-
cow. It harmed Ukraine’s negotiating 
position, even as recently as December 
9 when Zelensky and Putin met to dis-
cuss the conflict in the east shown in 
this photo. 
Ambassador Taylor explained: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
The CHAIRMAN. I think you also testified 
that Russia was watching closely to gauge 
the level of American support for the 
Ukrainian government. Why is that signifi-
cant? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. This is significant, 
Mr. Chairman, because the Ukrainians, in 
particular under this new administration, 
are eager to end this war, and they were 
eager to end it in a way that the Russians 
leave their territory. These negotiations, 
like all negotiations, are difficult. Ukrain-
ians would like to be able to negotiate from 
a position of strength or at least more 
strength than they now have. Part of that 
strength, part of the ability of the Ukrain-
ians to negotiate against the Russians with 
the Russians for an end to the war in 
Donbas, depends on United States and other 
international support. If we withdraw or sus-
pend or threaten to withdraw our security 
assistance, that’s a message to the Ukrain-
ians, but it’s at least as important, as your 
question indicates, Mr. Chairman, to the 
Russians, who are looking for any sign of

weakness or any sign that we are with-
drawing our support for Ukraine. 
The CHAIRMAN. And so, when the Ukrain-
ians learned of the suspension of the mili-
tary aid, either privately or when others 
learned publicly, the Russians would be 
learning also, and they would take that as a 
lack of robust U.S. support for Ukraine. Is 
that right? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. That’s correct, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. And that would weaken 
Ukraine in negotiating an end to the war in 
Donbas. 
Ambassador TAYLOR. It would. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Indeed, the aid 
doesn’t just supply much needed weap-
ons to Ukraine. It is a symbol of sup-
port, a signal of strength, a signal of 
the backing of the United States. With-
holding that aid, even for a period of 
time, undermined all of those things. 
President Trump’s actions toward 
Ukraine also undercut worldwide con-
fidence in the United States as a reli-
able security partner. Maintaining that 
confidence is crucial to the strength of 
our alliances in Europe to deterring 
Russia and ultimately protecting and 
projecting 
democracy 
around 
the 
world. 
The United States has roughly 68,000 
troops stationed in Europe. They serve 
alongside troops from 28 other coun-
tries that comprise the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, or NATO. They 
are holding the line against further 
Russian aggression. It was U.S. leader-
ship that led to the creation of NATO 
70 years ago as the Iron Curtain was de-
scending across the heart of Europe, 
and it is American leadership that 
makes NATO work today. 
NATO is also affected because other 
countries, friends and foes alike, know 
that we are committed to our collec-
tive defense; that an attack against 
one nation is an attack against all of 
us. That principle deterred a Russian 
invasion of Europe during the Cold 
War. It has only been invoked once by 
NATO in the aftermath of the Sep-
tember 11 terrorist attacks. New York 
is a long way from the frontlines with 
Russia, but our European allies stood 
with us after that dark day. 
They deployed tens of thousands of 
troops to Afghanistan and joined us in 
fighting the al-Qaida terrorists who at-
tacked the Twin Towers and the Pen-
tagon. 
Now, Ukraine is not a member of 
NATO, 
but 
Russia’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine was a threat to the peace and 
security of Europe. Moscow’s aggres-
sion threatened the rules of the road 
that have kept the peace in Europe 
since World War II, the sacrosanct idea 
that borders cannot be changed by 
military force. 
If we had not supported Ukraine in 
2014, if Members of this body had not 
voted overwhelmingly on a bipartisan 
basis for military assistance to rebuild 
Ukraine’s military, there is no ques-
tion it would have invited further Rus-
sian adventurism in Ukraine and per-
haps elsewhere in the heart of Europe. 
It would have weakened our allies and 
exposed U.S. troops stationed in Eu-
rope to greater danger. 
Deterring Russia requires persist-
ence—not just one military aid pack-
age or one Oval Office meeting but a 
sustained policy of support for our 
partners. We only deter Russia by con-
sistently demonstrating support for 
our friends—friends like Ukraine. 
George Shultz, who served as Ronald 
Reagan’s Secretary of State, under-
stood this. He compared diplomacy and 
alliance management to gardening. He 
said: 
If you plant a garden and go away for six 
months, what have you got when you come 
back? Weeds. Diplomacy is kind of like that. 
You go around, talk to people, you develop a 
relationship of trust and confidence, and 
then if something comes up, you have that 
base to work from. 
President Trump’s decision to trans-
form the military aid and Oval Office 
meeting into leverage was the equiva-
lent of trampling all over George 
Shultz’s garden, crushing Ukraine’s 
confidence in the United States as a 
partner. He also caused our NATO al-
lies to question whether we would 
stand with them against Russia. Lead-
ers in European capitals now wonder 
whether personal political favors and 
not treaty obligations guide our for-
eign policy. 
Colleagues, this is how alliances 
wither and die and how Russia wins. 
Ambassador Taylor made clear that is 
why it is so important to our security 
that we stand with Ukraine. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, as 
my colleague, Deputy Assistant Secretary 
George Kent, described, we have a national 
security policy, a national defense policy 
that identifies Russia and China as adver-
saries. The Russians are violating all of the 
rules, treaties, understandings that they 
committed to that actually kept the peace in 
Europe for nearly 70 years. Until they in-
vaded Ukraine in 2014, they had abided by 
sovereignty of nations, of inviolability of 
borders. That rule of law, that order that 
kept the peace in Europe and allowed for 
prosperity as well as peace in Europe was 
violated by the Russians. And if we don’t 
push back on that, on those violations, then 
that will continue. And that, Mr. Chairman, 
affects us. It affects the world that we live 
in, that our children will grow up in, and our 
grandchildren. This affects the kind of world 
that we want to see abroad. So that affects 
our national interest very directly. Ukraine 
is on the front line of that conflict. 
We understood that in 2017, the first 
year of the Trump administration, and 
it appeared the Trump administration 
understood it as well. We understood it 
in 2018, and the Trump administration 
understood that as well. We understood 
that in 2019, and the Trump adminis-
tration appeared to as well—at least it 
did until it didn’t. It did until some-
thing of greater importance and sig-
nificance came along. That event of 
greater significance to the Oval Office 
was the emergence of Joe Biden as a 
candidate for President, and then that 
military support, which had increased 
during the Trump administration, was 
suddenly put on hold for inexplicable 
reasons. 
Ukraine got the message. It wasn’t 
very inexplicable to Ukraine. What is 
more, Russia got the message. It 
wasn’t very inexplicable to Russia, 
which had pushed out the whole propa-
ganda theory that it was Ukraine that 
had interfered in our election and not 
Russia. 
So that consensus among the Con-
gress and the administration, among 
the right and the left and the center, 
that, as Ambassador Taylor explained, 
this is not only vital to Ukraine’s secu-
rity and the post-World War II order 
that has kept the peace in Europe for 
70 years, but it is vital to us and our se-
curity as well, that all broke down. 
That all broke down over an effort led 
by the President and his agent Rudy 
Giuliani and his agents Parnas and 
Fruman to overturn all of that—over-
turn a decades-long commitment to 
standing up to Russian aggression. 
We have so tremendously benefited. 
No country has benefited more from 
the international rules of the road, the 
international order, than the United 
States. It gave us the peace and sta-
bility to prosper like no other nation 
has before, and we are throwing it 
away. We are throwing it away. We are 
undermining the rule of law. We are 
undermining the principle that you 
don’t invade your neighbor. We are un-
dermining the key to our own success. 
And for what? For help with a political 
campaign. To quote Bill Taylor, that is 
crazy. That is crazy. 
If our allies can’t trust us to stand 
behind them in a time of need, we will 
soon not have a single ally left. I know 
it is painful to see some of our allies 
and how they talk about this President 
because when they talk about this 
President, they are also talking about 
the United States. It is painful to see 
our allies distance themselves from the 
United States. It is more than painful; 
it is dangerous. It is dangerous to us. I 
think it was Churchill who once said 
there is nothing worse than allies ex-
cept having no allies. 
If we are going to condition our sup-
port for our allies on their willingness 
to be dragged kicking and screaming 
into our politics, if we are going to 
condition the strength of our alliance 
on whether they will help us cheat in 
an election, we are not going to have a 
single ally left, and not a single one of 
us in this Chamber is ever going to be 
able to say to one of our counterparts 
to respect the rule of law without it 
being thrown in our face. 
Promoting the rule of law and fight-
ing corruption is central to our foreign 
policy. It distinguishes U.S. global 
leadership from the transactional ap-
proach favored by authoritarian adver-
saries. 
The inherently corrupt nature of the 
President’s demand that Ukraine in-
vestigate his political opponent under-
mined the credibility of efforts to pro-
mote the rule of law and combat cor-
ruption in Ukraine and around the 
world. Indeed, the President engaging 
in the very conduct at home that our 
policy fights abroad sabotages long-
standing bipartisan pillars of American 
diplomacy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S541 
January 24, 2020 
This was a problem, not least because 
the 
pervasive 
corruption 
within 
Ukraine leaves its politics and econ-
omy susceptible to Russian influence 
and subterfuge. 
Ambassador Yovanovitch emphasized 
that U.S. policy in Ukraine has long 
recognized that the struggle against 
corruption and defending against Rus-
sia are, in fact, two sides of the very 
same coin. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Corruption 
makes Ukraine’s leaders ever vulnerable to 
Russia, and Ukraine people understand that. 
That’s why they launched the Revolution of 
Dignity in 2014, demanding to be a part of 
Europe, demanding transformation of the 
system, demanding to live under the rule of 
law. 
Ukrainians wanted the law to apply equal-
ly to all people, whether the individual in 
question is the President or any other cit-
izen. It was a question of fairness, of dignity. 
Here, again, there is a coincidence of inter-
ests. Corrupt leaders are inherently less 
trustworthy while an honest and account-
able Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.- 
Ukrainian partnership more reliable and 
more valuable to the United States. 
A level playing field in this strategically 
located country, bordering four NATO allies, 
creates an environment in which U.S. busi-
ness can more easily trade, invest, and prof-
it. 
Corruption is also a security issue, because 
corrupt officials are vulnerable to Moscow. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. During that 
conversation that we related in the 
past, when Ambassador Volker urged 
his 
Ukrainian 
counterpart, 
Andriy 
Yermak, not to investigate the past 
President of Ukraine and Yermak 
threw it back in his face—you remem-
ber the conversation: Oh, you mean 
like the investigation you want us to 
do of the Clintons and the Bidens. They 
taught us something in that conversa-
tion. They taught us that we had for-
gotten, for that moment, our own val-
ues. 
Just listening to the Ambassador 
right now, I was thinking how inter-
esting it is that Ukrainians chose to 
describe their revolution as a Revolu-
tion of Dignity. Maybe that is what we 
need here—a revolution of dignity at 
home, a revolution of civility here at 
home. Maybe we can learn a lot more 
from our Ukrainian ally. 
In short, it is in America’s national 
security 
interest 
to 
help 
Ukraine 
transform into a country where the 
rule of law governs and corruption is 
held in check. 
As we heard yesterday, anti-corrup-
tion policy was a central part of the 
talking points provided to President 
Trump before his phone calls with 
President Zelensky on April 21 and 
July 25. President Trump, of course, 
didn’t mention corruption, but, impor-
tantly, those same foreign policy goals 
remained intact following the call, as 
Tim Morrison testified. Anti-corrup-
tion reforms—institutional reforms— 
remain a top priority to help Ukraine 
fight corruption. 
President Zelensky was swept into 
office on an anti-corruption platform. 
Immediately, he kept his promise and 
introduced numerous bills in Ukraine’s 
Parliament. In a sign that he intended 
to hold himself accountable, Zelensky 
even introduced a draft law on Presi-
dential impeachment. He also intro-
duced a bill to restore punishment of 
top officials found guilty of ‘‘illicit en-
richment.’’ 
President 
Trump’s 
self-serving 
scheme 
threatened 
to 
undermine 
Zelensky’s 
anti-corruption 
work. 
Zelensky’s successful anti-corruption 
reforms would have advanced U.S. se-
curity. Instead, President Trump’s de-
mands undermined that effort to bring 
about reform to Ukraine. 
Here is George Kent, a rule of law 
and corruption expert at the State De-
partment. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. KENT. U.S. efforts to counter corrup-
tion in Ukraine focus on building institu-
tional capacity so that the Ukrainian Gov-
ernment has the ability to go after corrup-
tion and effectively investigate, prosecute, 
and judge alleged criminal activities using 
appropriate institutional mechanisms, that 
is, to create and follow the rule of law. That 
means that if there are criminal nexuses for 
activity in the United States, U.S. law en-
forcement should pursue the case. If we 
think there’s been a criminal act overseas 
that violates U.S. law, we have the institu-
tional mechanisms to address that. It could 
be through the Justice Department and FBI 
agents assigned overseas, or through treaty 
mechanisms, such as a mutual legal assist-
ance treaty. 
As a general principle, I do not believe the 
United States should ask other countries to 
engage in selective politically associated in-
vestigations or prosecutions against oppo-
nents of those in power because such selec-
tive actions undermine the rule of law, re-
gardless of the country. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So it is clear: 
What President Trump did when abus-
ing his office and demanding Ukraine 
open an investigation into Joe Biden 
was not fighting corruption. It was not 
part of established U.S. anti-corruption 
policy. That corrupt pressure campaign 
for his own, personal political benefit 
in fact subverted U.S. anti-corruption 
efforts in Ukraine and undercut our na-
tional security. 
President Trump is not fighting to 
end corruption in Ukraine, as my col-
league in the House, Mr. HIMES, point-
ed out during one of our hearings. He 
was 
trying 
to 
aim 
corruption 
in 
Ukraine at Vice President Biden and 
our 2020 election. 
Selective, politically motivated pros-
ecutions of political opponents under-
cut governance in Ukraine. President 
Trump’s demand that Zelensky help 
him do precisely what U.S. diplomats 
for decades advised Ukrainian officials 
not to do completely undercut the 
credibility of efforts to promote the 
rule of law there. The demand also un-
dercut the U.S. moral standing and au-
thority in the eyes of a global audi-
ence. 
Once again, here is George Kent. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Mr. Kent, is pressuring 
Ukraine to conduct what I believe you have 
called ‘‘political investigations’’ a part of 
U.S. foreign policy to promote the rule of 
law in Ukraine and around the world? 
Mr. KENT. It is not. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Is it in the national inter-
ests of the United States? 
Mr. KENT. In my opinion, it is not. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Why not? 
Mr. KENT. Because our policies, particu-
larly in promoting the rule of law, are de-
signed to help countries. And in Eastern Eu-
rope and Central Europe, that is overcoming 
the legacy of communism. In the communist 
system in particular, the Prosecutor General 
Office was used to suppress and persecute 
citizens, not promote the rule of law. So, in 
helping these countries reach their own aspi-
rations to join the Western community of 
nations and live lives of dignity, helping 
them have the rule of law, with strong insti-
tutions, is the purpose of our policy. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. So, in other words, it is a 
purpose of our foreign policy to encourage 
foreign nations to refrain from conducting 
political investigations. Is that right? 
Mr. KENT. Correct. And, in fact, as a mat-
ter of policy, not of programming, we often-
times raise our concerns, usually in private, 
with countries that we feel are engaged in 
selective political prosecution and persecu-
tion of their opponents. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Ambassador 
Yovanovitch aptly summarized 
the 
global consequences and harm to U.S. 
national security resulting from Presi-
dent Trump’s demand that Ukraine in-
vestigate his political opponent. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Such con-
duct undermines the U.S., exposes our 
friends, and widens the playing field for 
autocrats like President Putin. Our leader-
ship depends on the power of our example 
and the consistency of our purpose. Both 
have now been opened to question. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The issues I 
just covered are not a matter of policy 
disagreement over foreign policy and 
national security. Article I asserts that 
the President was engaged in no such 
policy at all but, instead, sold out our 
policies and our national interests for 
his own personal gain and to help him 
corrupt the next election. That is the 
core conduct of an impeachable of-
fense. 
The President’s abuse of power also 
affected our election integrity. 
The Framers of our Constitution 
were particularly fearful that a Presi-
dent might misuse or abuse the power 
of his office to undermine the free and 
fair elections at the heart of our de-
mocracy. Sadly, that moment has ar-
rived. President Trump’s repeated so-
licitation of a Ukrainian investigation 
was a clear effort to leverage foreign 
interference and bolster his prospects 
in the 2020 election; in other words, to 
cheat in his election. 
In our democracy, power flows from 
the will of the people as manifested in 
free and fair elections. One person, one 
vote is fundamental in our democracy. 
President Trump’s invitation of for-
eign interference in the 2020 election— 
for the purposes of helping him win an 
election—undercut the Constitution’s 
commitment to popular sovereignty. 
Americans are now left to wonder if 
their vote matters or if they are simply 
pawns in a system being manipulated

January 24, 2020 
by shadowy foreign forces working on 
behalf of the corrupt interests of a law-
less President. Over the long term, this 
weakens our democratic system’s ca-
pacity for self-governance by encour-
aging apathy and nonparticipation. 
Cynicism makes it easier for enemies 
to influence our politics and undermine 
the national good. Indeed, this is pre-
cisely what Vladimir Putin intended 
when he meddled in the 2016 election: 
for us to become more cynical; for us 
to lose faith in the notion that the 
American system of government is su-
perior to the corrupt, autocratic model 
of government that he has erected in 
Russia and sought to export to places 
like Ukraine. 
These are not the free and fair elec-
tions Americans expect or demand if 
foreign powers are interfering. How can 
we know that our elections are free 
from foreign interference, whether by 
disinformation or hacking or fake in-
vestigations? We must not become 
numb to foreign interference in our 
elections. 
Our elections are sacred. If we do not 
act to put an end to the solicitation of 
foreign interference in our election by 
the President of the United States, the 
effect would be corrosive to our elec-
tions and our values. Future Presidents 
may believe that they, too, can use the 
substantial power conferred on them 
by the Constitution in order to under-
mine our system of free and fair elec-
tions, that they, too, can cheat to ob-
tain power or keep it. That way lies 
disaster for the great American experi-
ment in self-governance. 
As you have seen, there is powerful 
evidence that President Trump will 
continue to betray the national inter-
est to a foreign power and further un-
dermine both our security and democ-
racy. This creates an urgent need to re-
move him from office before the next 
election. 
To explain the nature of that con-
tinuing threat, let me describe Russia’s 
ongoing efforts to harm our elections, 
the President’s corrupt refusal to con-
demn or defend against those attacks, 
his statements confirming that he wel-
comes foreign interference in our elec-
tions so long as this is meant to help 
him and his conduct, proving that he 
will persist in seeking to corrupt elec-
tions at the expense of our security and 
at the expense of those elections. 
Let’s start with Russia’s ongoing at-
tacks on our democracy. At the heart 
of the President’s Ukraine scheme is 
his decision to subscribe to that dan-
gerous conspiracy theory that Ukraine, 
not Russia, was responsible for inter-
fering in 2016. President Trump and his 
men pressured Ukraine into inves-
tigating this bogus piece of Russian 
propaganda, and in doing so, they aided 
Putin’s concerted plot to undermine 
our security and democracy. 
Special Counsel Mueller warned that 
Putin’s plot was ongoing: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
HURD. Is this—in your investigation, did 
you think this was a single attempt by Rus-
sia to get involved in our election, or do you 
find evidence to suggest they’ll try to do this 
again? 
MUELLER. Oh, it wasn’t a single attempt. 
They’re doing it as we sit here, and they ex-
pect to do it during the next campaign. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Not a single 
attempt. They’re doing it as we sit 
here, and they expect to do it in the 
next campaign. 
That was Special Counsel Mueller’s 
stark warning. And we now know that 
Director Mueller was right. Just the 
other week, we saw public reporting 
that Russian hackers may be using 
phishing emails to attack Ukrainian 
gas company Burisma, presumably in 
search of dirt on Joe Biden. Those are 
the same tactics deployed by the same 
adversary, Russia, that the special 
counsel warned about in the last elec-
tion. It may be Russia once again at-
tempting to sway our election for one 
candidate, this time through Ukraine. 
Indeed, President Trump, to this very 
day, refuses to accept the unanimous 
assessment of our intelligence commu-
nity and law enforcement professionals 
that Russia interfered in the 2016 cam-
paign and poses a threat to the 2020 
Presidential election. Instead, he views 
it from his own personal lens—whether 
it is an attack on the legitimacy of his 
2016 electoral victory. 
Special Counsel Mueller’s testimony 
on July 24, 2019, the day before the 
President’s 
call 
with 
President 
Zelensky, 
contradicted 
President 
Trump’s claim that his was ‘‘a clean 
campaign.’’ Mueller found that individ-
uals associated with the 2016 campaign 
of the President welcomed Russia’s of-
fers of assistance and adjusted their po-
litical strategy so that then-Candidate 
Donald Trump might benefit from Rus-
sia’s assistance. 
When they were subsequently asked 
by U.S. law enforcement about their 
activities, President Trump’s advisers 
repeatedly lied. In Helsinki in July of 
2018, however, President Trump refused 
to acknowledge the Russian threat to 
our elections. When a reporter explic-
itly asked whether he believed Putin or 
the U.S. intelligence agencies on the 
issue of foreign interference in the 2016 
election, President Trump said: ‘‘I 
don’t see any reason why it would 
be’’—Russia—and 
talked 
about 
the 
DNC server. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. So let me just say that 
we have two thoughts. You have groups that 
are wondering why the FBI never took the 
server. Why haven’t they taken the server? 
Why was the FBI told to leave the office of 
the Democratic National Committee? I’ve 
been wondering that. I’ve been asking that 
for months and months, and I’ve been 
tweeting it out and calling it out on social 
media. Where is the server? I want to know, 
where is the server? And what is the server 
saying? 
With that being said, all I can do is ask the 
question. My people came to me—Dan Coats 
came to me and some others—they said they 
think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he 
just said it’s not Russia. 
I will say this: I don’t see any reason why 
it would be, but I really do want to see the 
server. But I have—I have confidence in both 
parties. I really believe that this will prob-
ably go on for a while, but I don’t think it 
can go on without finding out what happened 
to the server. What happened to the servers 
of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on 
the DNC? Where are those servers? They’re 
missing. Where are they? What happened to 
Hillary Clinton’s emails? Thirty-three thou-
sand emails gone—just gone. I think, in Rus-
sia, they wouldn’t be gone so easily. I think 
it’s a disgrace that we can’t get Hillary Clin-
ton’s 33,000 emails. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I am sure you 
remember this. It was, I think, unfor-
gettable for every American. But I am 
sure it was equally unforgettable for 
Vladimir Putin. I mean, there he is, 
the President of Russia, standing next 
to the President of the United States 
and hearing his own Kremlin propa-
ganda talking points coming from the 
President of the United States. Now, if 
that is not a propaganda coup, I don’t 
know what is. 
It is the most extraordinary thing. It 
is the most extraordinary thing: the 
President of the United States stand-
ing next to the President of Russia, our 
adversary, saying he doesn’t believe his 
own intelligence agencies. He doesn’t 
believe them. He is promoting this 
kooky, crazy server theory cooked up 
by the Kremlin, right next to the guy 
who cooked it up. It is a breathtaking 
success of Russian intelligence. I don’t 
know if there has ever been a greater 
success of Russian intelligence. What-
ever profile Russia did of our Presi-
dent, boy, did they have him spot-on. 
Flattery and propaganda. Flattery and 
propaganda is all Russia needed. 
As to Ukraine, well, they needed to 
deliver a political investigation to get 
help from the United States. I mean, 
this is just the most incredible propa-
ganda coup. As I said yesterday, it is 
not just that the President of the 
United States, standing next to Vladi-
mir Putin, is reading Kremlin talking 
points; he will not read his own na-
tional security staff talking points, but 
he will read the Kremlin ones. It is not 
just that he adopts the Kremlin talk-
ing points. That would be bad enough. 
It is not bad enough, it is not damaging 
enough, it is not dangerous enough to 
our national security that he is under-
mining our own intelligence agencies. 
It is not bad enough that he under-
mines those very agencies that he 
needs later, that we need later to have 
credibility. 
We just had a vigorous debate over 
the strikes against General Soleimani, 
and the President has made his argu-
ment about what the intelligence says 
and supports. How do you make those 
arguments when you say the U.S. intel-
ligence community can’t be believed? 
Now, we have had a vigorous debate 
about what that intelligence has to 
say. That is not the issue here. The 
issue here is you undermine the credi-
bility of your own intelligence agen-
cy—you weaken the country—for when 
you need to rely on them, for when you 
need to persuade your friends and your 
allies that ‘‘you can trust us when we

tell you this is what the intelligence 
shows.’’ How do you make that argu-
ment, as the President of the United 
States, when you have just told the 
world you trust the Russians more 
than your own people? You trust Rudy 
Giuliani more than Christopher Wray. 
How do you make that case? And if you 
can’t make that case, what does that 
mean to our security? 
But that is not the end of it. It is not 
just the propaganda coup. It is not just 
the undermining of our agencies. It is 
also that the buy-in to that propa-
ganda meant that Ukraine wasn’t 
going to get money to fight the Rus-
sians. 
I mean, that is one hell of a Russian 
intelligence coup. They got the Presi-
dent of the United States to provide 
cover for their own interference with 
our election. They got the President of 
the United States to discredit his own 
intelligence agencies. They got the 
President of the United States to drive 
a wedge between the United States and 
Ukraine. They got the President of the 
United States to withhold aid from 
Ukraine in a war with Russia, in a war 
that is claiming Ukrainian lives every 
week. 
Has there ever been such a coup? I 
would submit to you, in the entire 
length of the Cold War, the Soviet 
Union had no such success—no such 
success. And why? Because a former 
mayor of New York persuaded a Presi-
dent of the United States to sacrifice 
all of that for a cheap shot at his polit-
ical opponent, for a smear against his 
political opponent. Was it worth it? I 
hope it was worth it. I hope it was 
worth it for the President because it 
certainly wasn’t worth it for the 
United States. 
Now, you can see President Trump 
did not blame Vladimir Putin and the 
Russian 
intelligence 
agencies 
who 
interfered in our election for the ques-
tions surrounding his victory. He did 
not blame the people who worked for 
his campaign and were subsequently 
convicted of lying to our law enforce-
ment agencies. No. He blamed the in-
vestigators—Special Counsel Mueller, 
the man in charge of getting to the 
bottom of Russia’s interference in 2016. 
And he chose to believe Vladimir 
Putin, a former Russian intelligence 
officer, rather than his own intel-
ligence agencies. 
We can see a pattern here. President 
Trump solicited interference from Rus-
sia as a candidate in 2016, and then his 
campaign 
welcomed 
Russian 
inter-
ference in the election. 
In Helsinki, President Trump chose 
to believe Putin over his own agencies: 
‘‘I don’t see any reason why it would 
be’’—referring to Russia. Instead of de-
nouncing Russia’s interference, he de-
nounced those investigating Russia’s 
interference, and he raised that now-fa-
miliar DNC CrowdStrike server thing: 
‘‘I really do want to see the server. I 
don’t think it can go on without find-
ing out what happened to the server.’’ 
That is the exact same server that 
President Trump demanded Ukraine 
investigate during his July 25 call with 
President Zelensky. 
When the President talked about the 
DNC server in Helsinki, with Vladimir 
Putin standing by his side, he was ref-
erencing the same discredited con-
spiracy theory about the Ukraine in-
terference in 2016 that Putin repeatedly 
promoted. 
Let’s look at this Washington Post 
article from July 2018. 
In the end, Trump’s performance alongside 
Putin in the Finnish capital seemed like a 
tour through his most controversial con-
spiracy theories, tweets and off-the-cuff 
musings on Russia—except he did it all while 
abroad, standing just feet from Putin, the 
leader of one of America’s greatest geo-
political foes. 
The spectacle in Helsinki also underscored 
Trump’s eagerness to disregard his own ad-
visers, his willingness to flout the conclu-
sions of his own intelligence community— 
that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections— 
and his apparent fear that pressing Putin on 
the subject might cast doubt on his electoral 
victory. 
White House officials told the Wash-
ington Post that President Trump’s re-
marks in Helsinki were ‘‘very much 
counter to the plan.’’ 
That is another understatement of 
the century. If that sounds familiar, it 
is because the witnesses who testified 
before the House as part of the im-
peachment inquiry all said the same 
thing about the July 25th phone call. 
The President ignored vital national 
security issues he was supposed to 
raise and instead raised disproven con-
spiracies about 2016 and the DNC serv-
er—the very same Russian propaganda 
he publicly endorsed in Helsinki. 
Do you think it is going to stop now? 
Do you think if we do nothing it is 
going to stop now? All of the evidence 
is to the contrary. You know it is not 
going to stop. 
The President just told one of the 
Members of this body he still wants 
Biden investigated. It is not going to 
stop unless the Congress does some-
thing about it. 
President Trump’s betrayal began in 
2016, when he first solicited Russian in-
terference in our election. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Candidate TRUMP. Russia, if you’re listen-
ing, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 
emails that are missing. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. That betrayal 
continued in Helsinki in 2018, when, as 
we saw, he rejected the intelligence 
community’s assessment about Rus-
sian interference in that same elec-
tion—when he criticized U.S. officials 
investigating the Russian interference 
and instead promoted Putin’s con-
spiracy theory about Ukraine. 
The betrayal continued in 2019 when 
he carried out a scheme to cheat in the 
2020 election by demanding that the 
leader 
of 
Ukraine—a 
U.S. 
partner 
under military attack by Russia—an-
nounced an investigation into the same 
baseless conspiracy theory about a 
DNC server and the bogus allegations 
about Vice President Biden. 
The abuse of power continues. He is 
still trying to cheat in the next elec-
tion, even after the scheme came to 
light. Even after it became the subject 
of an impeachment inquiry, it contin-
ued, and the false statements about it 
continued. 
President Trump repeatedly asserted 
that he had a prerogative to urge for-
eign nations to investigate U.S. citi-
zens who dare to challenge him politi-
cally. 
Just for a minute, we should try to 
step into the shoes of someone else. My 
father used to say, you don’t under-
stand a person until you step in their 
shoes. I also thought he invented that 
wisdom himself until I watched ‘‘To 
Kill a Mockingbird’’ and found out that 
Atticus Finch said it first. 
Let’s try to step into someone else’s 
shoes for a moment. Let’s imagine it 
wasn’t Joe Biden. Let’s imagine it was 
any one of us. Let’s imagine the most 
powerful person in the world was ask-
ing a foreign nation to conduct a sham 
investigation into one of us. What 
would we think about it then? Would 
we think that is good U.S. policy? 
Would we think he has every right to 
do it? Would we think that is a perfect 
call? 
Let’s step, for a minute, into Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch’s shoes, and we are 
the subject of a vicious smear cam-
paign that no one in the Department 
we work for, up to the Secretary of 
State, thinks has a shred of credibility. 
Let’s step into her shoes for a minute. 
We spent our whole life devoted to pub-
lic service, served in dangerous places 
around the world, and we are hounded 
out of our post. And one day someone 
releases a transcript of a call between 
the President of the United States and 
a foreign leader, and the President says 
there is going to be some things hap-
pening to you, or to you, or to you, or 
to you, or to you. How would you feel 
about the President of the United 
States? Would you think he was abus-
ing the power of his office? If you 
would, it shouldn’t matter that it 
wasn’t you. It shouldn’t matter that it 
was Marie Yovanovitch. It shouldn’t 
matter that it was Joe Biden. I will tell 
you something. The next time it just 
may be you. It just may be you. 
Do you think for a moment that any 
of you, no matter what your relation-
ship with this President, no matter 
how close you are to this President—do 
you think for a moment that if he felt 
it was in his best interest he wouldn’t 
ask you to be investigated? Do you 
think for a moment that he wouldn’t? 
If somewhere deep down below you 
realize that he would, you cannot leave 
a man like that in office when he has 
violated the Constitution. It shouldn’t 
matter that it was Joe Biden. It could 
have been any of us. It may be any of 
us. It shouldn’t matter that it was 
Marie Yovanovitch. It will be some 
other diplomat tomorrow, for some 
other pernicious reason. 
It goes to what Mr. JEFFRIES said. It 
goes to character. You don’t realize 
how important character is in the 
highest office in the land until you

don’t have it, until you have a Presi-
dent willing to use his power to coerce 
an ally to help him cheat, to inves-
tigate one of our fellow citizens—one of 
our fellow citizens. 
Yes, he is running for President. He 
is still a U.S. citizen. He is still a U.S. 
citizen, and he deserves better than 
that. 
Of course, it wasn’t just Ukraine. It 
wasn’t just Russia. There is the invita-
tion to China to investigate the Bidens. 
It is not going to stop. 
On September 19, Rudy Giuliani was 
interviewed by Chris Cuomo on CNN. 
You have probably all seen the clip. 
When asked specifically if he had urged 
Ukraine to look into Vice President 
Biden, Mr. Giuliani replied imme-
diately: ‘‘Of course I did.’’ ‘‘Of course I 
did.’’ 
It shouldn’t matter that it was Joe 
Biden. It wasn’t Hunter Biden there. It 
was Joe Biden. It wasn’t Hunter Biden 
on that call. It was Joe Biden. It 
shouldn’t matter whether it was Hun-
ter Biden or Joe Biden. We are talking 
about American citizens. It shouldn’t 
matter to any of us which American 
citizens. 
He hasn’t stopped urging Ukraine to 
conduct 
these 
investigations. 
Mr. 
Giuliani hasn’t. Donald Trump hasn’t. 
To the contrary and consistent with 
everything we know about the Presi-
dent, he has done nothing but double 
down. 
During the first week of December, 
Mr. Giuliani traveled to Ukraine and 
Hungary 
to 
interview 
the 
corrupt 
former Ukrainian prosecutors, who had 
been pushing these false narratives 
about Vice President Biden and this 
kooky 
conspiracy 
about 
2016. 
Mr. 
Giuliani met with current members of 
the Ukraine Parliament who have ad-
vocated for that same fraudulent inves-
tigation. 
In June of last year, President 
Trump told ABC News that he would 
take political dirt from a foreign coun-
try if it was offered again. 
If he has learned anything from the 
tumult of the last 3 years, it is that he 
can get away with anything, can do it 
again. He can’t be indicted. He can’t be 
impeached—can’t, if you believe our 
Attorney 
General, 
even 
be 
inves-
tigated. 
Our Founders worried about a situa-
tion just like this. James Madison put 
it simply: The President ‘‘might betray 
his trust to foreign powers.’’ In his 
farewell address, George Washington 
warned Americans ‘‘to be constantly 
awake, since history and experience 
prove that foreign influence is one of 
the most baneful foes of republican 
government.’’ 
John Adams, in a letter to Thomas 
Jefferson wrote: 
You are apprehensive of foreign Inter-
ference, Intrigue, Influence. So am I. But as 
often as Elections happen, the danger of for-
eign influence recurs. 
Or to quote the President’s Chief of 
Staff: 
Get over it. There is going to be politics in 
foreign policy. 
Well, I don’t think that was John 
Adams’ point, and I don’t think that 
was James Madison’s point, and I don’t 
think that was George Washington’s 
point. If it was, they would have said: 
‘‘Get over it.’’ But they recognized, as 
I know we recognize, what a profound 
danger that would be for that to be-
come the new normal. 
Another election is upon us. In 10 
months, voters will undertake their 
most important duty as citizens by 
going to the polls and voting for their 
leader. And so we must ask: What role 
will foreign powers play in trying to in-
fluence the outcome? And if they take 
the President’s side, who will protect 
our franchise if the President will not? 
As charged in the first Article of Im-
peachment, President Trump has dem-
onstrated that he will remain a threat 
to national security and the Constitu-
tion if allowed to remain in office and 
has acted in a manner grossly incom-
patible with self-governance and the 
rule of law. 
Based on the abuse of power for 
which he was impeached and his ongo-
ing powers to solicit foreign influence, 
both directly and through Mr. Giuliani, 
there can be little doubt that President 
Trump will continue to invite foreign 
interference in our elections again and 
again. That poses an imminent threat 
to the integrity of our democracy. 
Our Founders understood that a 
President like Donald Trump might 
one day grasp the reins of power: an 
unremorseful, overreaching executive, 
faithful to himself only, and willing to 
sacrifice our democracy and national 
security for his own personal advan-
tage. His pattern of conduct—repeat-
edly soliciting foreign interference in 
our elections for his own benefit—con-
firms that he will stop at nothing to 
retain his power. He willfully chose to 
place his own personal interests above 
the country’s and the integrity of our 
elections. 
There is every reason to believe that 
will continue. He has stonewalled Con-
gress and ordered executive branch 
agencies—organizations that work for 
the American people, not for the Presi-
dent—to join in his obstruction. He de-
ployed Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine to con-
tinue advancing a scheme that serves 
no other purpose than advancing his 
2020 reelection prospects. He attacked 
witnesses, public servants, patriots, 
who stayed true to their oath and lev-
eled with the American people about 
the grave national injury that resulted 
from the President’s misconduct. And 
he continued to urge foreign nations to 
investigate American citizens that he 
views as a threat. The threat that he 
will continue to abuse his power and 
cause grave harm to the Nation over 
the course of the next year, until a new 
President is sworn in or until he would 
be reelected is not a hypothetical. 
Merely 
exposing 
the 
President’s 
scheme has not stopped him from con-
tinuing this destructive pattern of be-
havior that has brought us to this som-
ber moment. He is who he is. That will 
not change, nor will the danger associ-
ated with him. Every piece of evidence 
supports the terrible conclusion that 
the President of the United States will 
abuse his power again, that he will con-
tinue to solicit foreign interference to 
help corruptly secure his reelection. He 
has shown neither remorse nor ac-
knowledgement of wrongdoing. If you 
can believe that July 25 was a perfect 
call, that asking for investigations of 
your political opponents and using the 
power of your office to make it so is 
perfectly fine, then, there is nothing 
that would stop you from doing it 
again. 
President Trump has abused the 
power of his office and must be re-
moved from that office. 
Mr. MCCONNELL, I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I suggest a 15-minute recess. 
There being no objection, at 3:30 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 4:04 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will come to order. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, first of all, I 
want to join my colleagues in just 
thanking you for your patience and 
your indulgence. 
What I can tell you today is that we 
are closer today than we were yester-
day because I am prepared to present 
article II: Obstruction of Congress. 
The second Article of Impeachment 
charges the President with misusing 
the powers of his high office to ob-
struct the House impeachment inquiry. 
We are here today in response to a 
blanket order issued by President 
Trump directing the entire executive 
branch to withhold all documents and 
testimony from that inquiry. 
President Trump’s obstruction of the 
impeachment inquiry was categorical, 
indiscriminate, and historically un-
precedented. And its purpose was clear: 
to impede Congress’s ability to carry 
out its duties under the Constitution to 
hold the President accountable for high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
As part of his effort to cover up evi-
dence of his scheme to solicit foreign 
interference in the upcoming election, 
President Trump did something no 
President has ever dared to do in the 
history of our Republic. President 
Trump directed the entire executive 
branch not to cooperate with the 
House’s impeachment inquiry. Presi-
dent Trump blocked every person who 
works in the White House and every 
person who works in every department, 
agency, and office of the executive 
branch from providing information to 
the House as part of the impeachment 
inquiry. 
This was not about specific, narrowly 
defined security or privacy issues. Nor 
was it based on potential privileges

January 24, 2020 
available to the executive branch. In-
deed, President Trump has not once as-
serted executive privilege during this 
process. 
This was a declaration of total defi-
ance of the House’s authority to inves-
tigate credible allegations of the Presi-
dent’s misconduct and a wholesale re-
jection of Congress’s ability to hold the 
President accountable. 
The President’s order, executed by 
his top aids, substantially interfered 
with the House’s constitutionally au-
thorized power to conduct an impeach-
ment inquiry. 
At President Trump’s direction, the 
White House itself refused to produce a 
single document or record in response 
to a House subpoena that remains in 
full force and effect, and it continues 
to withhold those documents from Con-
gress and from the American people. 
But it is not just the White House. 
Following President Trump’s order, the 
Office of the Vice President, the Office 
of Management and Budget, the De-
partment of State, the Department of 
Energy, and the Department of Defense 
all continued to refuse to produce a 
single document or record in response 
to 71 specific requests, including 5 sub-
poenas. 
Additionally, 
following 
President 
Trump’s order, 12 current or former ad-
ministration 
officials 
continue 
to 
refuse to testify as part of the House’s 
impeachment inquiry—not only cur-
rent 
administration 
officials 
but 
former administration officials as well. 
Nine of those witnesses, including sen-
ior 
officials 
with 
direct 
firsthand 
knowledge of the President’s actions, 
continue to defy subpoenas for testi-
mony because of the President’s order. 
And yet, despite President Trump’s ob-
struction, as you have heard and seen 
throughout the House managers’ pres-
entation of the facts of the President’s 
scheme, 
the 
House 
gathered 
over-
whelming evidence of his misconduct 
from courageous public servants who 
were willing to follow the law, comply 
with subpoenas, and tell the truth. 
On the basis of that formidable body 
of evidence, the House adopted the first 
Article of Impeachment. These wit-
nesses also testified with great speci-
ficity about extensive documents, com-
munications, and records in the posses-
sion of the White House and other 
agencies 
regarding 
the 
President’s 
scheme to coerce Ukraine’s leader to 
help his reelection. 
As you have heard over the past few 
days, the House was, therefore, able to 
develop an extensive catalog of specific 
documents and pertinent communica-
tions that go to the heart of the Presi-
dent’s wrongdoing and which the Presi-
dent has ordered be concealed from 
Congress and the American people. 
Revelations of evidence harmful to 
the President have only continued 
since the House compiled its investiga-
tive reports. Recent court-ordered re-
leases under the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act, as well as disclosures to the 
media, have further demonstrated that 
the White House, OMB, State Depart-
ment, and other agencies are actively 
withholding highly relevant documents 
that could further implicate the Presi-
dent and his subordinates. 
Over time, these documents and this 
evidence will undoubtedly come to 
light, and I ask this body to not wait to 
read about it in the press or in a book. 
You should be hearing this evidence 
now—hearing this evidence now. 
Now, there is one point that I would 
like to make very clear. President 
Trump’s wholesale obstruction of Con-
gress strikes at the very heart of our 
Constitution and our democratic sys-
tem of government. 
The President of the United States 
could undertake such comprehensive 
obstruction only because of the excep-
tional powers entrusted to him by the 
American people. Only one person in 
the world has the power to issue an 
order to the entire executive branch. 
That person, Senators, as you know, is 
the President. And President Trump 
used that power not to faithfully exe-
cute the law but to order agencies and 
employees of the executive branch to 
conceal evidence of his misconduct. 
Now, I know that no other American 
could seek to obstruct an investigation 
into his or her wrongdoing in this way. 
We all know that no other American 
could use the vast powers of our gov-
ernment 
to 
undertake 
a 
corrupt 
scheme to cheat to win an election and 
then use those same powers to suppress 
the 
evidence 
of 
his 
constitutional 
crime. We would not allow—I am con-
vinced that we would not allow any 
member of our State or local govern-
ments to use the official powers of 
their office to cover up crimes and mis-
deeds. As this body is well aware, may-
ors and Governors have gone to jail for 
doing so. Sheriffs and police chiefs are 
certainly not immune. If we allow 
President Trump to escape account-
ability, we will inflict lasting damage 
on the separation of powers among our 
branches of government—our funda-
mental system of checks and balances. 
It would inflict irreversible damage by 
allowing this Commander in Chief and 
establishing 
precedence 
for 
future 
Presidents to act corruptly or abu-
sively and then use the vast powers of 
their office—the Office of the Presi-
dency—to 
conceal 
their 
own 
mis-
conduct from Congress and the Amer-
ican people. In other words, we would 
create a system that allows this Presi-
dent and any future President to really 
do whatever he or she wants. 
It is an attack on congressional over-
sight, not just on the House but also on 
the Senate’s own ability to oversee and 
serve as a check on this and future 
Presidents in both Republican and 
Democratic administrations. Without 
meaningful 
oversight, 
without 
the 
power of impeachment, Americans will 
have to come to accept a far greater 
likelihood of misconduct by the Oval 
Office, and they would not be able to 
look to other branches of government 
to hold their President—the people’s 
President—accountable. 
Executive power without any sort of 
restraint, without oversight, and with-
out any checks and balances is abso-
lute power. We know what has been 
said about absolute power: ‘‘Absolute 
power corrupts absolutely.’’ 
This is the very opposite of what the 
Framers intended. The Framers of the 
Constitution 
purposefully 
entrusted 
the power of impeachment to the legis-
lative branch so that it may protect 
the American people from a corrupt 
President. Well, the times, Senators, 
have found us. If Congress allows Presi-
dent Trump’s obstruction to stand, it 
essentially nullifies the impeachment 
power. 
Senators, we are the keepers, the 
protectors, the defenders of what the 
Framers intended. We must hold any 
unprincipled and undisciplined Execu-
tive accountable. 
Senators, I know that this is not 
easy. I don’t take this moment lightly. 
These are tough times. I remember 
quite a few tough times during my 27 
years as a law enforcement officer, but 
we must stop this President. Today we 
will explain why. 
First, we will review key facts re-
garding the scope and breadth of Presi-
dent Trump’s unprecedented actions to 
stop the House’s impeachment powers. 
As you well know, we covered many of 
these facts on Tuesday when we ex-
plained in depth what evidence the 
President had blocked from Congress. 
We addressed documents we know the 
White House and other agencies are 
concealing. We addressed testimony 
the President’s aides would provide if 
they testified under oath. We will, 
therefore, review the documents and 
witnesses briefly. 
Second, after surveying relevant his-
tory and constitutional law, we will ex-
plain why obstruction of Congress in 
and of itself warrants impeachment 
and removal from office. 
Finally, we will demonstrate that 
President Trump is without question 
guilty of obstruction of Congress, that 
his defenses lack any legal foundation, 
and that his actions pose a dire and 
continuing threat to the foundation of 
our constitutional framework. 
This is very simple. It is simple. The 
President abused the powers entrusted 
in him by the American people in a 
scheme to suppress evidence, escape ac-
countability, and orchestrate a mas-
sive coverup, and he did so in plain 
sight. His obstruction remains ongoing. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, Senators, President’s 
counsel: 
Before I start, I, too, want to thank 
all the Senators for being so patient 
and being such good listeners. It re-
minds me, quite frankly, of one of the 
first days that I went to what was af-
fectionately 
called 
‘‘baby 
judge 
school.’’ When we first got started, 
those were the first two things they 
told us—that we needed to be patient 
and that we needed to listen and that 
we needed to be fair and always give 
the opportunity to be heard to each 
side.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S546 
January 24, 2020 
I am going to say that you have cer-
tainly been playing a very good role as 
judges because, although I know the 
press calls you jurors, I know that you 
are in the role of judges, and I com-
mend you for being good listeners and 
for having the patience to listen to us 
these last 2 days and in our final re-
marks today. So thank you all. 
Ms. DEMINGS has given us an over-
view of the second Article of Impeach-
ment: Obstruction of Congress. 
So let us now turn to the facts of the 
case because to fully appreciate the 
scope and the scale of the President’s 
wrongdoing and the size of the coverup 
he has orchestrated, it requires an un-
derstanding of the evidence that he has 
lawlessly hidden from Congress and the 
American people. 
President Trump categorically, indis-
criminately, 
and 
in 
unprecedented 
fashion obstructed Congress’s impeach-
ment inquiry; in other words, he or-
chestrated a coverup. He did it in plain 
sight. 
First, from the beginning, the Trump 
administration sought to hide the 
President’s misconduct by refusing to 
turn over the Intelligence Committee 
whistleblower complaint. That com-
plaint would sound the first alarm of 
the President’s wrongdoing. 
Second, the President issued an order 
prohibiting the entire executive branch 
from participating in the impeachment 
inquiry—no cooperation, no negotia-
tion, nothing—or as we say in Texas, 
nada. 
Following 
the 
President’s 
orders, 
Federal agencies refused to produce 
documents, and key witnesses refused 
to testify. In fact, the President sanc-
tioned specific directions to officials, 
ordering them to defy congressional 
subpoenas. Third, and perhaps the most 
reprehensible of all, the President 
waged a campaign of intimidation 
against those brave public servants 
who did come forward to comply with 
their obligation under the law. 
Senators, as I mentioned, I am a law-
yer and a former judge. I have never 
ever seen anything like this from a liti-
gant or a party in any case, not any-
where. But from the very beginning of 
this scandal, President Trump has 
sought to hide and cover up key evi-
dence. 
The coverup started even before the 
House began to investigate the Presi-
dent’s Ukrainian-related activity. It 
began when the White House sought to 
conceal the record of Donald Trump’s 
July 25 call with the President of 
Ukraine by placing it on a highly clas-
sified system. But, as we have said be-
fore, there was no legitimate national 
security reason to do so. The coverup 
continued. A top OMB official in-
structed the freeze to be ‘‘closely 
held.’’ In other words, ‘‘Don’t say any-
thing to anybody.’’ 
Senators, you know that in order to 
lock in the hold of the funding, the 
President was required to notify Con-
gress about the amount of money in-
volved and why he was intending to 
freeze it. Instead, the White House 
tried to keep the freeze secret. 
Maybe they kept it a secret because 
a senior White House aide, Rob Blair, 
accurately predicted to his boss, Mick 
Mulvaney, to ‘‘expect Congress to be-
come unhinged’’ if it learned that bi-
partisan aid approved for a valuable 
foreign partner was being frozen for the 
President’s personal gain. 
But the coverup reached its peak 
soon after August 12 because, on Au-
gust 12, a whistleblower filed a lawful 
and protected complaint intended for 
Congress with the inspector general of 
the intelligence community. The Presi-
dent, who was the subject of the com-
plaint, learned of the filing well before 
Congress and the American people. 
In an effort to conceal the whistle-
blower’s concerns, the White House and 
the Department of Justice took an un-
precedented step. No administration 
had ever intervened in such a manner 
before. But President Trump maneu-
vered to keep the whistleblower’s con-
cerns from the congressional Intel-
ligence Committee. 
In the history of the Intelligence 
Committee Whistleblower Protection 
Act, no credible and urgent complaint 
had ever, ever been withheld from Con-
gress—not ever before. It was through 
immense public pressure and vigorous 
oversight by the House that the Trump 
administration ultimately produced a 
complaint to the House and Senate In-
telligence Committees. I will add that 
even when it was produced, it was 
weeks after the legal deadline. 
If the President’s efforts to conceal 
the whistleblower’s concerns had suc-
ceeded, Congress would never have 
learned about the existence of the com-
plaint, let alone the allegations that it 
contained. But this attempt to hide 
key information from Congress was 
only the first sign of what was to come. 
Following new, deeply troubling rev-
elations about the President’s July 25 
call, on September 24, the Speaker of 
the House announced that the House 
investigations 
into 
the 
President’s 
scheme to pressure Ukraine for per-
sonal gain would be folded into the on-
going impeachment inquiry. Just days 
later, the President began to attack 
the legitimacy of the House impeach-
ment inquiry. 
While standing on the tarmac at An-
drews Air Force Base, President Trump 
argued that the House impeachment 
inquiry ‘‘shouldn’t be allowed.’’ He 
claimed ‘‘There should be a way of 
stopping it—maybe legally, through 
the courts.’’ 
Let’s watch the President and what 
he had to say: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
The PRESIDENT. My call was perfect. The 
President, yesterday, of Ukraine said there 
was no pressure put on him whatsoever. 
None whatsoever. And he said it loud and 
clear to the press. What these guys are 
doing—Democrats—are doing to this country 
is a disgrace and it shouldn’t be allowed. 
There should be a way of stopping it—maybe 
legally, through the courts. 
Ms. 
Manager 
GARCIA 
of 
Texas. 
‘‘There should be a way of stopping it.’’ 
Soon after, President Trump took 
the matter into his own hands. The 
President used his authority and his of-
fice to wage a relentless and mis-
leading public campaign to attack the 
impeachment inquiry. 
The President spent time at rallies, 
at press conferences, and on Twitter 
trying to persuade the American people 
that the House’s inquiry was invalid 
and fraudulent. 
Here are just a few of President 
Trump’s comments about the impeach-
ment inquiry. He called it ‘‘a witch 
hunt,’’ ‘‘a COUP,’’ ‘‘an unconstitu-
tional power grab,’’ and ‘‘a fraud 
against the American people.’’ He said 
it is ‘‘the phony Impeachment Scam,’’ 
‘‘the phony Impeachment Hoax,’’ the 
‘‘Ukraine Hoax,’’ and ‘‘a continuation 
of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt 
in the history of our Country.’’ 
Those are probably some of the ones 
that I can repeat here. And it didn’t 
stop. The attacks did not end there. 
President Trump turned from rhetoric 
to action. 
On October 8, the White House sent a 
letter to Speaker NANCY
PELOSI
in-
forming her that President Trump 
would seek to completely obstruct the 
impeachment inquiry. They sent this 
letter. 
White 
House 
stationery. 
I 
shouldn’t say this—I am a lawyer—but 
it is very lawyerly. It is an eight-page 
letter. You know, lawyers can’t do one 
thing in one page; we have to do it in 
seven or eight. This was eight pages, 
and it is long. No worries, I am not 
going to read it all. I just want to get 
to the bottom line. It says: ‘‘President 
Trump cannot permit his Administra-
tion to participate in this partisan in-
quiry under these circumstances.’’ 
He was just saying: We are not going 
to cooperate. 
The letter is dated, again, October 8, 
and it is signed by Pat Cipollone, who 
is here, of course, with us today as the 
lead counsel for the President. 
The President did not make any 
claim of privilege. The President did 
not make any attempt to compromise. 
He had no valid excuse. Although we 
are all too familiar with President 
Trump’s rhetoric and rants, these 
words in this letter on White House 
stationery, signed by his lead counsel 
here today, have consequences. These 
words have consequences. They were 
more than just ink on a page. They 
were more than just eight pages of 
words. 
In the days that followed, President 
Trump’s agencies and officials followed 
his order to conceal information from 
Congress. Over the past few days, you 
have heard in extensive detail from all 
of us about some of the specific and in-
criminating documents that the Presi-
dent has withheld from Congress. But, 
again, here is the bottom line: The 
House investigating committees sought 
a total of 71 specific categories of docu-
ments from 6 different agencies and of-
fices. President Trump blocked every 
single one of these requests—all of 
them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S547 
January 24, 2020 
Between September 27 and October 
10, the investigating committees issued 
subpoenas to the Department of State, 
the White House, the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, Department of De-
fense, and the Department of Energy. 
The committees always remained open 
to working with the executive branch 
to discuss and prioritize the subpoenas. 
Some agents initially suggested that 
they might comply. For example, a few 
days after receiving the subpoena, the 
Department of State staff reached out 
to the committee to ‘‘discuss accom-
modations.’’ 
As you all know, the accommodation 
process is when Congress and the exec-
utive branch discuss priorities and con-
cerns so that the committee gets what 
it needs most efficiently, while mini-
mizing any burden to the agency. 
On October 7, the committee staff 
met with State Department officials. 
During that conversation, the commit-
tees made a good-faith attempt to en-
gage the Department in negotiations. 
To start, the committees requested 
that the Department prioritize produc-
tion of a narrow set of nonprivileged 
documents. 
The 
Department’s 
rep-
resentatives stated that they would 
take the request back to senior State 
Department officials, but that was the 
end. That was the end. Those priority 
documents were never provided to the 
committees. 
In addition to the State Department, 
the Department of Defense also showed 
an initial interest in cooperating. Dur-
ing an October 13 television appear-
ance, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper 
stated repeatedly that the Department 
of Defense would seek to comply. He 
said on air, on TV, that they would 
seek to comply with the subpoena. 
In an exchange on ‘‘Face the Na-
tion,’’ he was specifically asked: 
Question. Very quickly, are you going to 
comply with the subpoena that the House 
provided you and provide documents to them 
regarding the halt to military aid to 
Ukraine? 
Answer. [From the Secretary] Yeah we will 
do everything we can to cooperate with the 
Congress. Just in the last week or two, my 
general counsel sent out a note as we typi-
cally do in these situations to ensure docu-
ments are retained. 
[But, again, the question is] Is that a yes? 
Answer. [By the Secretary] That’s a yes. 
Question. You will comply with the sub-
poena? 
Answer. [Again, by the Secretary] We will 
do everything we can to comply. 
These are his very own words: We can 
comply. 
But remember that October 8 letter 
from the White House Counsel sent to 
the Speaker stating the President’s po-
sition of total defiance. President 
Trump—again, I will quote it. It said: 
‘‘President Trump cannot permit his 
Administration to participate in this 
partisan 
inquiry 
under 
these 
cir-
cumstances.’’ 
So every department and every of-
fice, top to bottom, of the executive 
branch was under these instructions. 
You know, that is about 2 million pub-
lic servants, top to bottom. The execu-
tive branch was all ordered by Presi-
dent Trump not to provide information 
to Congress. The President offered no 
accommodation and no opportunity for 
negotiation. 
Ultimately, each agency and office 
followed the President’s order. In re-
sponse to each subpoena, the Trump 
administration 
produced 
no 
docu-
ments—nothing, nada—and the agen-
cies and offices made clear that it was 
due to the President’s instructions. 
They always deferred to that October 8 
letter. 
For example, despite the Secretary’s 
initial signal of cooperation—I gave 
you the quote from when he was asked 
specifically on TV. He said they would 
try to cooperate. But despite that, the 
Department of Defense later refused to 
respond to the committee’s subpoena. 
In a letter to the committees, the De-
partment of Defense echoed many of 
the White House’s unsupported legal 
arguments and concluded: ‘‘In light of 
these concerns, and in view of the 
President’s position as expressed in the 
White House Counsel’s October 8 letter, 
and without waiving any other objec-
tions to the subpoena that the Depart-
ment may have, the Department is un-
able to comply with your request for 
documents at this time.’’ 
In a TV interview on ‘‘Face the Na-
tion, they tried to ask him again. When 
asked by Chris Wallace on FOX News: 
Question. And—but do you feel Congress 
has a right to oversight and to be able to see 
documents from the Pentagon about a pro-
gram that was approved by Congress? 
Answer. Well, they do, but provided it’s 
done in the right and proper way. And I 
think that was the issue. Again, I think my 
reputation is pretty good in terms of being 
very transparent. I like to communicate 
with members of Congress. But in this case, 
they were—my recollection is that there 
were technical and legal issues that prohib-
ited us from doing exactly what was re-
quested by Congress. 
So he said he would try to cooperate, 
to seek to comply, but now they are 
back-peddling. But, Senators, there 
were no valid technical or legal argu-
ments. None were put forth to justify 
the stonewalling of the impeachment 
inquiry. 
The 
documents 
President 
Trump is withholding are highly rel-
evant, responsive, and would further 
our understanding of the President’s 
scheme. 
Here is just a sampling of the docu-
ments we know exist that are cur-
rently being withheld: National Secu-
rity Advisor John Bolton’s notes, Am-
bassador Taylor’s first-person cable to 
Secretary 
Pompeo, 
emails 
between 
OMB and other agencies about the 
President’s directive to place a hold on 
the Ukraine military aid, and the hun-
dreds of heavily redacted documents 
that 
the 
administration 
has 
now 
turned over to third parties under 
FOIA court orders. 
Certainly the documents released 
pursuant to the FOIA lawsuits were 
not subject to any claims of privilege 
or confidentiality or burden. The ad-
ministration released them publicly. 
By contrast, the President turned over 
nothing in response to the House im-
peachment investigation. 
Senators, there still is another com-
ponent of the President’s obstruction 
that I want all of us to focus on. 
Not only did the President block 
agencies and offices from producing 
documents, his administration also 
blocked current and former officials 
from identifying, producing, or even re-
viewing relevant documents. 
First, the Trump administration ac-
tively discouraged its employees from 
even identifying documents responsive 
to the committees’ request. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary George 
Kent testified in his deposition that he 
informed the State Department attor-
ney 
about 
additional 
responsive 
records that the Department had not 
collected. According to Kent, the De-
partment attorney ‘‘got very angry’’ 
and ‘‘objected to [Mr. Kent] raising of 
the additional information.’’ He ‘‘made 
clear that he did not think it was ap-
propriate for [Mr. Kent] to make the 
suggestion.’’ 
So here is a lawyer telling the wit-
ness: Don’t say that. I just—frankly, as 
a lawyer and former judge, I just can’t 
believe something like this would hap-
pen. But Kent responded that he was 
just trying to ‘‘make sure that the De-
partment was being fully responsive.’’ 
Second, the Trump administration 
refused to permit individual witnesses 
to produce relevant documents them-
selves. 
After the State Department failed to 
respond to voluntary requests for docu-
ments at the beginning of the inves-
tigation, the committee sent document 
requests to six individual State Depart-
ment employees. Secretary Pompeo ob-
jected to the committee’s request to 
State officials, calling them ‘‘an act of 
intimidation and invitation to violate 
federal court laws.’’ He also claimed 
that the House inquiry was ‘‘an at-
tempt to intimidate, bully, and treat 
improperly the distinguished profes-
sionals of the Department of State.’’ 
Now we were the bullies. But let’s be 
clear: His statement has been contra-
dicted by actual State Department pro-
fessionals from whom the committees 
sought documents. Kent testified that 
he ‘‘had not felt bullied, threatened, 
and intimidated’’ by the House. In fact, 
Kent said that the language in Sec-
retary Pompeo’s letter, which had been 
drafted by a State Department attor-
ney, was without consulting Mr. Kent. 
He said: ‘‘It was inaccurate’’—‘‘inac-
curate.’’ Then the State Department 
ordered witnesses to withhold docu-
ments from Congress. 
For example, on October 14, the De-
partment sent a letter to Kent’s per-
sonal 
attorney 
warning—warning: 
‘‘Your client is not authorized to dis-
close to Congress any records relating 
to official duties.’’ 
Certain witnesses defied those orders 
and produced the substance of key doc-
uments, providing critical insight into

the President’s scheme. Other wit-
nesses produced documents to the 
Trump administration so they could be 
turned over to Congress, but now the 
administration is also sitting on those 
documents and is refusing to turn them 
over. Ambassador Taylor testified that 
he turned over documents to the 
Trump 
administration 
but, 
to 
his 
knowledge, they had not been produced 
to the House. 
Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. QUIGLEY. But has any of the docu-
ments that you turned over, to your knowl-
edge, been turned over to the committee? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. No. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Sen-
ators, I will confirm. The committees 
have not seen not one of these docu-
ments—none. 
Finally, if it could be any worse— 
well, it is—a Trump administration of-
ficial, Ambassador Sondland, informed 
us that he was not even permitted to 
review his own relevant records in 
preparation for their testimony. Again, 
this would be his own records so that 
he could prepare to testify. 
Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. I have not had 
access to all of my phone records, State De-
partment emails, and many, many other 
State Department documents. And I was told 
I could not work with my EU staff to pull to-
gether the relevant files and information. 
Having access to the State Department ma-
terials would have been very helpful to me in 
trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and 
met and when and what was said. 
My lawyers and I have made multiple re-
quests to the State Department and the 
White House for these materials. Yet these 
materials were not provided to me, and they 
have also refused to share these materials 
with this committee. These documents are 
not classified and, in fairness—and, in fair-
ness—should have been made available. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Of 
course, we agree. 
At President Trump’s order, agencies 
and offices refused to produce docu-
ments in response to the committee’s 
requests, and they refused to allow in-
dividual witnesses to do so either. 
So let’s recap. No documents—zero, 
goose egg, nada—in response to over 70 
requests—70 requests and 5 subpoenas. 
There was no attempt to negotiate, no 
genuine 
attempt 
to 
accommodate. 
There was categorical, indiscriminate, 
and unprecedented stonewalling. 
Again, never in my time as a lawyer 
or as a judge have I seen this kind of 
total disrespect in defiance of a law-
fully issued subpoena—and all on Presi-
dent Trump’s orders. And it could con-
tinue because this obstruction of Con-
gress is real, and it is beyond—be-
yond—comparison. 
This 
President 
should be removed. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, let’s turn to 
President Trump’s efforts to stop wit-
nesses from testifying. 
No other President facing impeach-
ment has taken the extreme step to 
prohibit executive branch witnesses 
from testifying before Congress. Even 
President Nixon, who famously at-
tempted to defy a subpoena for tape re-
cordings of his conversations, let his 
most senior staff testify before Con-
gress. 
I remember listening on TV as John 
Dean testified before the Senate Water-
gate Committee. He was the Presi-
dent’s lawyer. President Nixon didn’t 
block him. Not only did President 
Nixon allow his staff to testify before 
Congress; he publicly directed them to 
testify and without demanding a sub-
poena. 
Actually, with the Senate Watergate 
investigation, President Nixon said: 
All members of the White House staff will 
appear voluntarily when requested by the 
committee. They will testify under oath, and 
they will answer fully all proper questions. 
Now 
compare 
that 
to 
President 
Trump. 
He 
publicly 
attacked 
the 
House’s impeachment inquiry, calling 
it ‘‘constitutionally invalid,’’ and he 
ordered every single person working in 
the executive branch to defy the House 
impeachment inquiry. 
As just discussed, in the letter to the 
Speaker of the House, the White House 
Counsel said that President Trump 
‘‘cannot permit his administration to 
participate.’’ 
No President ever used the official 
power of his office to prevent witnesses 
from giving testimony to Congress in 
such a blanket and indiscriminate 
manner. There is no telling how many 
government officials would have come 
forward if the President hadn’t issued 
this order. 
Let’s look at some of the witnesses 
who followed the President’s orders. 
The House issued subpoenas to com-
pel the testimony of three officials at 
the Office of Management and Budget: 
Acting Director Russell Vought, Asso-
ciate Director Michael Duffey, and As-
sociate Director, Brian McCormack. 
According to testimony in the House, 
which was reinforced by emails re-
cently revealed through the Freedom 
of Information Act lawsuits, OMB was 
just central to the President’s hold on 
security assistance to Ukraine. Its offi-
cials served as conduits for the White 
House to implement the hold without 
directly engaging the agencies that ac-
tually supported release of the aid. 
President Trump directed these three 
OMB officials to violate their legal ob-
ligation by defying lawful subpoenas, 
and they followed his orders. 
This isn’t just an argument. It is a 
fact. In response to House subpoenas, 
OMB sent a letter to Chairman SCHIFF 
refusing to comply. This is what the 
letter said: ‘‘As directed by the White 
House Counsel’s October 8, 2019, letter, 
OMB will not participate in this par-
tisan 
and 
unfair 
impeachment 
in-
quiry.’’ 
In that simple statement, OMB ad-
mitted several key points. First, Mr. 
Cipollone’s letter of October 8 was an 
official 
directive 
from 
the 
White 
House. 
Second, President Trump’s blanket 
order applied to OMB and the three of-
ficials subpoenaed by the House. 
Third, President Trump’s blanket 
order not only directed them to refuse 
to participate voluntarily; it also di-
rected them to defy House subpoenas. 
Fourth, President Trump’s blanket 
order directly prevented the three OMB 
officials from providing testimony to 
the House. 
There is no question about the scope 
of President Trump’s order. It was 
total. There is no question about the 
intent of the order. It was clearly un-
derstood by administration officials, as 
shown by OMB. And there is no ques-
tion the order had an impact. It di-
rectly prevented the House from get-
ting testimony from the three senior 
officials at OMB. 
So here we are. The President of the 
United States issued an official order 
forbidding every single person who 
works for the executive branch of our 
government from giving testimony to 
the House as part of an impeachment 
investigation. That order prevented the 
House from getting testimony from 
witnesses who knew about the Presi-
dent’s conduct. 
The matter is simple. It is plain to 
see. The question we here in Congress 
must ask is whether we are prepared to 
turn a blind eye to a President’s ob-
struction—obstruction 
not 
only 
of 
oversight but also the power to deter-
mine whether Congress may gather evi-
dence in an impeachment proceeding. 
If the Senate is prepared to accept 
that, it will mean that not only Presi-
dent Trump but all Presidents after 
him 
will 
have 
veto 
power 
over 
Congress’s ability to conduct oversight 
and the power of impeachment. The 
House was not prepared to accept that, 
and that is why the House approved ar-
ticle II. 
As you consider what you think 
about this, please know that President 
Trump’s blanket order was not the end 
of his campaign to obstruct the im-
peachment inquiry. Actually, it was 
just the beginning. 
In addition to his total ban of gov-
ernment witnesses, President Trump 
also sent specific explicit orders. He di-
rected key witnesses to defy subpoenas 
and to refuse to testify as part of the 
House’s impeachment inquiry. 
As you know, the House subpoenaed 
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney. We wanted his testimony. 
At a White House press briefing in 
October—I know you have seen it be-
fore—Mr. Mulvaney confirmed what we 
had suspected. Mr. Mulvaney admitted 
that President Trump withheld the aid 
to pressure Ukraine into announcing 
an investigation into the conspiracy 
theory that Ukraine interfered in the 
2016 elections. Here are his words. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. MULVANEY. Did he also mentioned to

the DNC server? Absolutely, no question 
about that. But that’s it, and that’s why we 
held up the money.

January 24, 2020 
Mulvaney to testify, but on the day of 
Mr. Mulvaney’s scheduled deposition, 
the White House sent a letter to his 
personal attorney. It prohibited him 
from obeying the subpoena. The letter 
said: 
‘‘The 
President 
directs 
Mr. 
Mulvaney not to appear at the Com-
mittee’s scheduled deposition.’’ 
When he issued this order, President 
Trump doubled down on his previous 
blanket order. He did so after the 
House voted to approve resolution 660, 
which in no uncertain terms made 
clear that Mr. Mulvaney was being sub-
poenaed to testify in an impeachment 
investigation. 
This order was the first of many. 
President Trump also ordered another 
White House official, Robert Blair, not 
to testify. Mr. Blair is Mr. Mulvaney’s 
senior adviser and his closest aide. He 
was involved in communications about 
the hold on Ukraine aid. 
The day after his initially scheduled 
deposition, Mr. Blair’s personal attor-
ney sent a letter to the House. It said: 
‘‘Mr. Blair has been directed by the 
White House not to appear and tes-
tify.’’ 
The House also wanted testimony 
from John Eisenberg, the senior attor-
ney on President Trump’s National Se-
curity Council. As you have heard over 
the past few days, key witnesses, in-
cluding Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colo-
nel Vindman, said they were concerned 
by President Trump’s efforts to pres-
sure Ukraine. They were told to report 
these concerns to Mr. Eisenberg. 
The day before his scheduled deposi-
tion, the White House sent a letter to 
Mr. Eisenberg’s personal attorney. It 
said: 
‘‘The 
President 
directs 
Mr. 
Eisenberg not to appear at the Com-
mittee’s deposition.’’ Now, that lan-
guage is starting to sound familiar. 
Mr. Eisenberg’s personal attorney 
then sent a letter to the House. The 
letter said this: 
Under these circumstances, Mr. Eisenberg 
has no other option that is consistent with 
his legal and ethical obligations except to 
follow the direction of his client and em-
ployer, the President of the United States. 
Accordingly, Mr. Eisenberg will not be ap-
pearing for a deposition at this time. 
Now, that language, I think, is im-
portant. And it is telling. It shows that 
President 
Trump’s 
order 
left 
Mr. 
Eisenberg with ‘‘no other option that is 
consistent with his legal and ethical 
obligations.’’ By directing him to defy 
a lawful subpoena, President Trump 
created a legal and ethical problem for 
Mr. Eisenberg. 
I am sure you know, contempt of 
Congress can be punished as a criminal 
offense. It carries the possible sentence 
of up to 12 months in jail. No President 
has ever dared, during an impeachment 
inquiry, to officially and explicitly 
order government witnesses to defy 
House subpoenas. You don’t have to 
consider 
high-minded 
constitutional 
principles to understand why this was 
wrong. It is simple, really. By ordering 
specific government officials to defy 
congressional 
subpoenas, 
President 
Trump forced those officials to choose 
between submitting to the demands of 
their boss or breaking the law. Nobody 
should abuse a position of power in 
that way. But President Trump specifi-
cally ordered all three of these senior 
White 
House 
officials—Mulvaney, 
Blair, 
and 
Eisenberg—to 
defy 
the 
House’s subpoenas and refuse to tes-
tify. 
President Trump’s efforts to conceal 
his actions didn’t stop there, and they 
didn’t stop at the front door of the 
White House. No less than 12 other wit-
nesses were specifically ordered not to 
testify. One of those witnesses, Ulrich 
Brechbuhl, 
hasn’t 
been 
highlighted 
much over the past few days, but the 
way he fits into the story is worth not-
ing. 
Mr. Brechbuhl is a senior official at 
the State Department. Like these 
other senior officials, he was ordered 
not to testify. In a letter to the House, 
his attorney said: ‘‘Mr. Brechbuhl has 
received a letter of instruction from 
the State Department directing that he 
not appear.’’ Mr. Brechbuhl is still an-
other person who could shed light on 
President Trump’s actions. He was 
kept updated on Rudy Giuliani’s broad-
er efforts in Ukraine. He had firsthand 
knowledge of Secretary Pompeo’s in-
volvement. For one thing, he handled 
Ambassador Yovanovitch’s recall from 
Ukraine, though he refused to meet 
with her in the aftermath. 
Also, 
messages 
by 
Ambassador 
Volker show that Mr. Brechbuhl knew 
about Mr. Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine 
as they occurred. On July 10, Ambas-
sadors Taylor, Volker, and Sondland 
discussed Rudy Giuliani’s push abroad. 
While discussing the problems Rudy 
was creating by meddling in official 
U.S. foreign policy, Ambassador Taylor 
noted that he ‘‘briefed Ulrich this 
afternoon.’’ Also on August 11, Ambas-
sador Sondland emailed Mr. Brechbuhl 
to ask him to brief Secretary Pompeo 
in the statement he was negotiating 
with President Zelensky, the aim of 
‘‘making the boss happy enough to au-
thorize an invitation.’’ 
Ambassador Sondland wrote to him: 
Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Z 
to be delivered for our review in a day or 
two. The contents will hopefully make the 
boss happy enough to authorize an invita-
tion. 
Now, State Department Executive 
Secretary Lisa Kenna answered Ambas-
sador Sondland several hours later, let-
ting him know that she passed that in-
formation on to Secretary Pompeo. 
Let’s pause here and consider why this 
message to Mr. Brechbuhl, which the 
State Department continues to con-
ceal, is important. In this exchange, 
Ambassador Sondland told Brechbuhl 
that he had negotiated a deal to get 
President Zelensky to make a state-
ment and that Sondland hoped that the 
promised statement would ‘‘make the 
boss happy enough to authorize an in-
vitation.’’ 
It shows that senior State Depart-
ment leadership, including Secretary 
Pompeo, was quite aware of the deal to 
trade an invitation to the White House 
for 
a 
statement 
from 
President 
Zelensky. 
Indeed, Ambassador Sondland con-
firmed that he kept them in the loop. 
Here is his testimony: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. We kept the 
leadership of the State Department and the 
NSC informed of our activities, and that in-
cluded communications with Secretary of 
State 
Pompeo; 
his 
counselor, 
Ulrich 
Brechbuhl; his Executive Secretary, Lisa 
Kenna; and also communications with Am-
bassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, Mr. Morrison, and 
their staff at the NSC. They knew what we 
were doing and why. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Eight other 
witnesses were also ordered not to tes-
tify as part of the House’s impeach-
ment inquiry, but those eight wit-
nesses came forward anyway, despite 
the President’s efforts to prevent them 
from testifying. All of the following 
witnesses were told not to testify: Am-
bassador Marie Yovanovitch, Ambas-
sador Gordon Sondland, Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary of State George Kent, 
Ambassador Bill Taylor, Deputy As-
sistant Secretary of Defense Laura 
Cooper, Deputy Associate Director at 
OMB Mark Sandy, State Department 
official Catherine Croft, and State De-
partment official Christopher Ander-
son. Each of these eight witnesses fol-
lowed the law. They obeyed House sub-
poenas, and they testified before the 
House. 
In all, we know that by issuing the 
blanket order and later specific orders, 
President Trump prevented at least 12 
current or former administration offi-
cials 
from 
testifying 
during 
the 
House’s impeachment inquiry. He spe-
cifically forced nine of those witnesses 
to defy duly authorized subpoenas. 
The facts are straightforward, and 
they are not in dispute: 
First, in the history of our Republic, 
no President ever dared to issue an 
order to prevent even a single govern-
ment witness from testifying in an im-
peachment inquiry. 
Second, President Trump abused the 
power of his office by using his official 
power in an attempt to prevent every 
single person who works in the execu-
tive branch from testifying before the 
House. 
Finally, President Trump’s orders, in 
fact, prevented the House from obtain-
ing key witness testimony from at 
least 12 current or former government 
officials. 
President Trump’s orders were clear; 
they were categorical; they were indis-
criminate; and they were wrong. They 
prevented key government witnesses 
from testifying. There is no doubt. 
That is obstruction, plain and simple. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice, now let us turn to some final 
sets of facts. In a further effort to si-
lence his administration, President 
Trump engaged in a brazen effort to 
publicly attack and intimidate the 
dedicated public servants who came 
forward to testify. To be clear, these

January 24, 2020 
witnesses didn’t seek the spotlight in 
this way. For years, they had quietly 
and effectively performed their duties 
on behalf of our national interest and 
on behalf of the American people. 
Why would they seek the spotlight in 
this way, knowing that the President 
of the United States would lead the 
chorus of attacks against them. And he 
did. In response, the President issued 
threats, openly discussed possible re-
taliation, attacked their character and 
patriotism, and subjected them to 
mockery and other insults—the Presi-
dent. The President’s attacks were 
broadcast to millions of Americans, in-
cluding the witnesses, their families, 
their friends, and their coworkers. This 
campaign of intimidation risked dis-
couraging witnesses from coming for-
ward voluntarily or complying with 
mandatory subpoenas for documents 
and testimony. And, as we all know, 
witness 
intimidation 
is 
a 
Federal 
crime. 
There is simply not enough time 
today to walk through each of the 
President’s attacks on the House’s wit-
nesses, but let’s talk about a few. As I 
am sure my colleagues recall, the 
House subpoenaed Ambassador Marie 
Yovanovitch for public testimony. Am-
bassador Yovanovitch’s first tour was 
in Somalia, an increasingly dangerous 
place as that country’s civil war pro-
gressed. During a different tour, Am-
bassador Yovanovitch helped to open a 
U.S. Embassy, during which time the 
Embassy was attacked by a gunman 
who sprayed the Embassy building 
with gunfire. Ambassador Yovanovitch 
has also served as an ambassador to 
Armenia and served the U.S. Embassy 
in Moscow. As Chairman SCHIFF said 
earlier, she has served in some dan-
gerous places around the world on be-
half of our interests and the interests 
of the American people. 
President Trump’s Under Secretary 
of State for Political Affairs described 
Ambassador Yovanovitch as ‘‘an excep-
tional officer, doing exceptional work 
at a critical embassy in Kyiv.’’ But 
during Ambassador Yovanovitch’s pub-
lic 
testimony, 
President 
Trump 
tweeted: 
Everywhere 
Marie 
Yovanovitch 
went 
turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how 
did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, 
where the new Ukrainian President spoke 
unfavorably about her in my second phone 
call with him. It is a U.S. President’s abso-
lute right to appoint ambassadors. 
In that same hearing, Chairman 
SCHIFF asked Ambassador Yovanovitch 
for her reactions to the President’s at-
tacks during her testimony before the 
House. Let’s listen to that exchange. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SCHIFF. Ambassador, you’ve shown 
the courage to come forward today and tes-
tify, notwithstanding the fact you were 
urged by the White House or the State De-
partment not to, notwithstanding the fact 
that, as you testified earlier, the President 
implicitly threatened you in that call 
record. And now the President, in real-time, 
is attacking you. What effect do you think 
that has on other witnesses’ willingness to 
come forward and expose wrongdoing? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. It is very in-
timidating. 
Mr. SCHIFF. It is designed to intimidate, 
is it not? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. I mean, I 
can’t speak to what the President was trying 
to do, but I think the effect is to be intimi-
dating. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Well, I want to let you know, 
Ambassador, that some of us here take wit-
ness intimidation very, very seriously. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. The House 
also subpoenaed the public testimony 
of Ambassador William B. Taylor, an-
other career public servant, who grad-
uated at the top of his class from West 
Point, served as an infantry com-
mander in Vietnam, and earned a 
Bronze Star and an Air Medal with the 
‘‘V’’ device for Valor. 
Yet, shortly after Ambassador Taylor 
came forward to Congress, President 
Trump publicly referred to him as a 
Never Trumper without any basis. 
Then, when a reporter noted that Sec-
retary of State Mike Pompeo had hired 
Ambassador Taylor, President Trump 
responded: 
‘‘Hey, 
everybody 
makes 
mistakes.’’ He then had the following 
exchange about Ambassador Taylor. 
Let’s listen. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. He’s a Never Trumper. 
His lawyer is the head of the Never Trump-
ers. They’re a dying breed, but they are still 
there. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambas-
sador Taylor has since stepped down 
from his position as our chief diplomat 
in Ukraine. 
In addition to his relentless attack 
on witnesses who testified in connec-
tion to the House’s impeachment in-
quiry, the President also repeatedly 
threatened and attacked the member of 
the intelligence community who filed 
the anonymous whistleblower com-
plaint. In more than 100 statements 
about the whistleblower over a period 
of just 2 months, the President publicly 
questioned the whistleblower’s motives 
and disputed the accuracy of the whis-
tleblower’s account. 
But 
most 
disturbing, 
President 
Trump issued a threat against the 
whistleblower and those who provided 
information to the whistleblower. Let’s 
listen. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. I want to know who’s 
the person, who’s the person who gave the 
whistleblower 
the 
information. 
Because 
that’s close to a spy. You know what we used 
to do in the old days when we were smart? 
Right? The spies and treason, we used to 
handle it a little differently than we do now. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. The Presi-
dent’s need to conceal his actions was 
so extreme that he even attacked the 
credibility of those witnesses who 
served our country in combat. This in-
cluded Active Duty military personnel 
and veterans who earned the Purple 
Heart and Bronze Star, among other 
battlefield recognition. But President 
Trump showed utter disregard for such 
patriotism. For example, President 
Trump attacked Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman during his testimony on No-
vember 19, seeking to question his loy-
alty to the United States. The Presi-
dent retweeted that Lieutenant Colo-
nel Vindman was offered the position 
of Defense Minister for the Ukrainian 
Government three times. Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman, the national security 
director for Ukraine, has been an Ac-
tivity Duty Army officer for more than 
20 years. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman 
earned a Purple Heart for wounds he 
sustained in an improvised explosive 
attack or device in Iraq. 
President Trump’s campaign of in-
timidation is reprehensible, debases 
the Presidency, and was part of his ef-
fort to obstruct the impeachment in-
quiry. The fact that it is the President 
of the United States making these 
threats tells us something. It tells us 
that the President desperately wanted 
to keep witnesses from testifying and 
thus further obstruct Congress’s in-
quiry. 
Senators, we cannot, and we must 
not, condone President Trump’s at-
tacks 
on 
whistleblowers 
and 
wit-
nesses—people who truly have the abil-
ity to put our country first. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Now that we 
have carefully reviewed the facts and 
have described the President’s categor-
ical obstruction of Congress, we ad-
dress questions of law. This discussion 
need not be abstract. The President’s 
obstruction impacts the Senate di-
rectly. It impacts the constituents you 
represent. It impacts you because your 
job as a Member of Congress is to hold 
the executive branch in check. This is 
true no matter who occupies the White 
House or which party controls the 
House or Senate. And the further the 
President—any 
President—departs 
from the law in the Constitution, the 
more important it is for you to do your 
job. 
I suspect that there is common 
ground here. We all know that in order 
for Congress to do its work, we must 
have information. What is reasonable 
policy? What is the administration 
doing? Do we support it? Should we op-
pose it? Should we enact legislation to 
correct the problem? Asking questions, 
gathering information, making deci-
sions based on the answers—this is one 
of the fundamental functions of Con-
gress. 
I suspect that we agree on this as 
well: Our ability to do that work de-
pends on gathering information. It de-
pends on the power of the congres-
sional subpoena. Even when you make 
a polite request for information from a 
friendly administration, that request is 
backed by the threat of a subpoena. 
And although the power of the con-
gressional subpoena has been affirmed 
repeatedly by the courts, enshrined in 
the rules of the House and Senate, and 
respected by executive branch agencies 
for centuries, if the President chooses 
to ignore our subpoenas, our powers as 
a branch of government—our ability to 
do our jobs, our ability to keep an ad-
ministration in check, our ability to 
make sure that the American people

are represented by a Congress, not just 
by a President—are diminished. 
Please know that we are not talking 
about a disagreement over the last few 
documents at the end of a long produc-
tion schedule. We are talking about a 
direct order from the President of the 
United States to completely disregard 
all our subpoenas, to deny us all infor-
mation the President wants to keep se-
cret. This is in order to deprive Con-
gress of our ability to hold an adminis-
tration accountable. It is a bid to neu-
ter Congress, to render the President 
all powerful since Congress could not 
have any information the President 
didn’t want us to have. Without infor-
mation, we cannot act. 
We must ask: Is there a consequence 
for a President who defies our sub-
poenas absolutely; who says to all 
branches of the administration ‘‘Do not 
obey 
a 
single 
congressional 
sub-
poena’’—categorically, without know-
ing the subject of the subpoena—just 
‘‘Never answer a congressional sub-
poena’’; who denies Congress the right 
to any information necessary to chal-
lenge his power? 
Would Madison, Hamilton, and Wash-
ington support removing a President 
who declares that the Constitution lets 
him do whatever he wants and who bra-
zenly adds that he can ignore any ef-
fort to investigate, even when backed 
by subpoenas that the law requires him 
to obey? The answer to all these ques-
tions is a resounding yes. 
Before diving in, I would like to set 
the historical scene. The Framers were 
wise. And so they worried that Presi-
dents would abuse their power for per-
sonal gain. They feared that someday a 
President might mistake himself for a 
King—whose decisions cannot be ques-
tioned, whose conduct cannot be inves-
tigated, whose power transcends the 
rule of law. Such a would-be King 
would certainly think things like ‘‘I 
have the right to do whatever I want as 
president.’’ He might believe that it is 
‘‘illegitimate’’ for anyone to inves-
tigate him. Of course, not even the 
Framers could have imagined a Presi-
dent would say these things out loud. 
A President with this view of raw 
power would attack anyone who tried 
to hold him to account, branding them 
‘‘human scum’’ and ‘‘the Enemy of the 
People.’’ He would argue that courts 
had no power to enforce subpoenas 
against him. 
He would conscript his allies to ridi-
cule Congress. He would harass wit-
nesses who testified against him, de-
claring it was disloyal to question his 
conduct. He would use the powers of 
his high office to sabotage our system 
of checks and balances. All of this we 
have seen in the last few years—indeed, 
in the last few months. 
The Framers wrote the impeachment 
clause to protect the American people 
from such a President. The impeach-
ment clause exists to protect our free-
dom and our democracy in between 
elections. It exists to remind Presi-
dents that they serve the public, not 
the other way around. It is a reminder 
to Presidents that they answer to 
something greater than themselves. It 
confirms that nobody in America is 
above the law, not even the President. 
As we have discussed, the impeach-
ment power does not magically protect 
us when a President commits high 
crimes and misdemeanors. In Benjamin 
Franklin’s words, the Framers left us a 
Republic—if we can keep it. 
One way we can uphold that promise 
is to do our duty as elected Members of 
Congress to hold the executive branch 
in check. That responsibility is part of 
the constitutional design. The burden 
is ours, regardless of our political 
party, no matter who sits in the Oval 
Office. 
In the ordinary course, when we do 
our jobs, we do our Nation a service by 
holding the executive branch—both its 
political leadership and its professional 
core—accountable to the people for its 
actions. 
When the President’s conduct ex-
ceeds the usual constitutional safe-
guards, it falls on the House to inves-
tigate Presidential wrongdoing and, if 
necessary, to approve Articles of Im-
peachment. It then falls on the Senate 
to judge, convict, and remove Presi-
dents who threaten the Constitution. 
This entire framework depends on 
Congress’s ability to discover and then 
to thoroughly investigate Presidential 
malfeasance. If Presidents could abuse 
their power and then conceal all the 
evidence from Congress, the impeach-
ment clause would be a nullity. We the 
people would lose a vital protection. 
That is why officials throughout his-
tory have repeatedly recognized that 
subpoenas served in an impeachment 
inquiry must be obeyed, including by 
the President. It is why, before Presi-
dent Trump, only a single official in 
American history has ever defied an 
impeachment subpoena. And that is 
why that official, Richard Nixon, faced 
Articles of Impeachment for doing so. 
As the House Judiciary Committee 
reasoned in its analysis of Nixon’s ob-
struction: ‘‘[U]nless the defiance of the 
[House] subpoenas . . . is considered 
grounds for impeachment, it is difficult 
to conceive of any President acknowl-
edging that he is obligated to supply 
the relevant evidence necessary for 
Congress to exercise its constitutional 
responsibility in an impeachment pro-
ceeding.’’ 
Representative Robert McClory, a 
Republican from Illinois, explained the 
importance of this Article of Impeach-
ment for our separation of powers. He 
said: 
. . . if we refuse to recommend that the 
President should be impeached because of his 
defiance of the Congress with respect to the 
subpoenas that we have issued, the future re-
spondents will be in the position where they 
can determine themselves what they are 
going to provide in an impeachment inquiry 
and what they are not going to provide, and 
this would be particularly so in the case of 
an inquiry directed toward the President of 
the United States. So, it not only affects this 
President but future Presidents. 
That is where we find ourselves now 
but with even greater force. 
President Nixon authorized other ex-
ecutive branch officials and agencies to 
honor their legal obligations. He also 
turned over many of his own docu-
ments. President Trump, in contrast, 
directed his entire administration— 
every agency, every office, and every 
official—not to cooperate with the im-
peachment inquiry. As in Nixon’s case, 
President Trump’s obstruction is mere-
ly an extension of his coverup. 
As 
in 
Nixon’s 
case, 
President 
Trump’s obstruction reveals conscious-
ness of guilt. Innocent people do not 
act this way. They do not hide all the 
evidence. And like Nixon, President 
Trump has offered an assortment of ar-
guments to excuse his obstruction. But 
as was true in Nixon’s case, none of 
these excuses can succeed. 
At bottom, these arguments amount 
to a claim that the President can dic-
tate the terms of his own impeachment 
inquiry. President Trump’s lawyers 
may insist his grounds for defying Con-
gress are unique and limited; that they 
only apply here, just this one time; 
that it was the House, not the Presi-
dent, that broke from precedent; that 
he would gladly comply with subpoenas 
if only the House would do as he in-
sists. 
That is pure fantasy. The President’s 
arguments are not a one-ride ticket. 
They are not unique to these facts. Un-
less they are firmly and finally re-
jected here, these bogus excuses will 
reappear every time Congress inves-
tigates 
any 
President 
for 
serious 
abuses of power—every single time. 
They will constitute a playbook for ig-
noring oversight, available to all fu-
ture Presidents—Democratic and Re-
publican. 
These arguments are not consistent 
with 
the 
Constitution. 
They 
are 
lawyerly window dressing for an un-
precedented, dangerous power grab. 
Plenty of Presidents and judges have 
complained about impeachment inquir-
ies, declaring their own innocence, at-
tacking the House’s motives, and in-
sisting that due process entitled them 
to all sorts of things. But no President 
or judge—except Richard Nixon—has 
ever defied subpoenas on that basis. 
And no President or judge—none—has 
ever directed others to defy subpoenas 
categorically across the board. They 
have all eventually recognized their 
obligations under the law. President 
Trump stands alone. 
If President Trump is permitted to 
defy our subpoenas here in an impeach-
ment inquiry, when the courts have 
said the congressional power of inquiry 
is at its highest, imagine what future 
Presidents will do when we attempt to 
conduct routine oversight. 
President Trump is the first leader of 
this Nation to declare that nobody can 
investigate 
him 
for 
official 
mis-
conduct, except on his own terms. In 
word and in deed, President Trump has 
declared himself above the law. He has

to conceal as much of the evidence 
from the American people and from 
this body as he can. In that, he must 
not succeed. If President Trump is al-
lowed to remain in office after this 
conduct, historians will mark the date 
that this Senate allowed this President 
to break one of our mightiest defenses 
against tyranny. They will wonder why 
Congress so readily surrendered one of 
its core constitutional powers. They 
will wonder why Congress admitted 
that a President can get away with 
anything, can violate any constitu-
tional rule, any liberty, any request for 
information, and get away with it sim-
ply by saying: I don’t have to answer 
your questions. Congress has no power 
to make me answer questions about my 
conduct. 
That is what is at stake. In the fu-
ture, people will despair that future 
Presidents will abuse their power with-
out fear of consequences or constraint. 
Let’s begin with a legal premise of 
the second Article of Impeachment. 
Congress has the power to inves-
tigate 
Presidents 
for 
official 
mis-
conduct. This premise is indisputable. 
In article I of the Constitution: 
All legislative powers herein granted shall 
be vested in the Congress of the United 
States, which shall consist of a Senate and 
House of Representatives. 
Each House may determine the rules of its 
own proceedings. 
Our investigations are grounded in 
article I of the Constitution, which 
grants Congress all legislative powers 
and authorizes each House to deter-
mine its own rules. As the Supreme 
Court has explained, the Constitution 
thus vests the House and the Senate 
with the power of inquiry, that it is 
‘‘penetrating and far-reaching.’’ 
Moreover, Congress can effectuate 
that power of inquiry by issuing sub-
poenas commanding the recipient to 
provide documents or to testify under 
oath. Compliance with subpoenas is 
mandatory. It is not at the option of 
the executive or the President. As the 
Supreme Court has explained: 
[I]t is unquestionably the duty of all citi-
zens to cooperate with the Congress in its ef-
forts to obtain the facts needed for intel-
ligent 
legislative 
action. 
It 
is 
their 
unremitting obligation to respond to sub-
poenas, to respect the dignity of the Con-
gress and its committees, and to testify fully 
with respect to matters within the province 
of proper investigation. 
More recently, U.S. District Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson has elaborated: 
[B]latant defiance of Congress’ centuries- 
old power to compel the performance of wit-
nesses is not an abstract injury, nor is it a 
mere banal insult to our democracy. It is an 
affront to the mechanism for curbing abusers 
of powers that the Framers carefully crafted 
for our protection, and, thereby, recalcitrant 
witnesses actually undermine the broader in-
terests of the people of the United States. 
In recognition of the important role 
that congressional inquiries play in 
protecting 
our 
democracy 
and 
in 
guarding the American people, it is un-
lawful to obstruct them. 
Of course, while Congress inves-
tigates many issues, one of the most 
important is misconduct in the execu-
tive branch. 
There is a long history of congres-
sional investigations into the execu-
tive branch. To name a few especially 
famous cases, Congress has inves-
tigated claims that President Lincoln 
mishandled Civil War military strat-
egy; the infamous Teapot Dome scan-
dal under President Harding; President 
Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate 
scandal; President Reagan’s involve-
ment in the Iran-Contra affair; Presi-
dent Clinton’s real estate dealings and 
the 
Monica 
Lewinsky 
scandal; 
warrantless wiretapping under Presi-
dent George W. Bush; and attacks on 
personnel in Benghazi under President 
Obama. 
Since the dawn of the Republic, 
Presidents have recognized Congress’s 
power to investigate the executive 
branch. Even in sensitive investiga-
tions involving national security and 
foreign policy, Presidents have pro-
vided Congress with access to senior of-
ficials and important documents. 
For example, in the Iran-Contra in-
quiry, President Reagan’s former Na-
tional Security Advisor, Oliver North, 
and the former Assistant to the Presi-
dent for National Security Affairs, 
John Poindexter, testified before Con-
gress. President Reagan also produced 
‘‘relevant excerpts of his personal dia-
ries to Congress.’’ 
During the Clinton administration, 
Congress obtained testimony from top 
advisers, 
including 
the 
President’s 
Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, his Chief 
of Staff Erskine Bowles, White House 
Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, and White 
House Counsel Jack Quinn. 
In the Benghazi investigation, Presi-
dent Obama made many of his top 
aides available for transcribed inter-
views, including National Security Ad-
visor Susan Rice and Deputy National 
Security Advisor for Strategic Commu-
nications 
Benjamin 
Rhodes. 
The 
Obama administration, in that case, 
also produced more than 75,000 pages of 
documents, including 1,450 pages of 
White House emails, with communica-
tions of senior officials on the National 
Security Council. 
To be sure, certain House Repub-
licans complained loudly that the 
Obama administration’s response to 
the Benghazi investigation was insuffi-
cient. Just imagine how they would 
have reacted if Obama had ordered 
total defiance of all subpoenas. They 
would have been outraged. Why? Be-
cause Congress unquestionably has the 
authority to investigate Presidential 
conduct. 
Not only does Congress have the 
power to investigate the Executive, 
but, as we have discussed, article I of 
the Constitution gives the House the 
sole power of impeachment. The Fram-
ers intended this power to be the cen-
tral check on out-of-control Presi-
dents. But it does not work automati-
cally. The House must investigate, 
question witnesses, and review docu-
ments. Only then can it decide whether 
to approve or not approve Articles of 
Impeachment. 
Therefore, 
when 
the 
House determines that the President 
may have committed high crimes and 
misdemeanors, it has the constitu-
tional duty to investigate his conduct. 
In such cases, the House acts not 
only pursuant to its ordinary legisla-
tive authority but also serves as a 
‘‘grand inquest of the Nation’’ because 
an impeachment inquiry wields one of 
the greatest powers of the Constitu-
tion—a power that exists specifically 
to constrain Presidents. 
Its subpoenas are backed with the 
full force of the impeachment clause. 
They cannot be thwarted by ordinary 
executive privileges or ordinary objec-
tions. It is therefore presumed—as 
President Polk conceded over 150 years 
ago—that ‘‘all the archives and papers 
of the Executive Departments, public 
or private, would be subject to . . . in-
spection’’ and ‘‘every facility in the 
power of the Executive [would] be af-
forded to enable [the House] to pros-
ecute the investigation.’’ What inves-
tigation? The impeachment investiga-
tion of President Polk. 
President’s Polk’s statement, which 
we will return to, was no outlier. Presi-
dents have long understood that they 
must comply with impeachment in-
quiries. Consistent with this under-
standing, in the history of the Repub-
lic, no President has ever claimed the 
unilateral prerogative to categorically 
defy a House impeachment inquiry. On 
the contrary, every President facing 
this issue has agreed that Congress 
possesses a broad and penetrating 
power of inquiry when investigating 
grounds for impeachment. 
This 
directly 
refutes 
President 
Trump’s claim that he obstructed Con-
gress to protect the Office of the Presi-
dent. Every prior occupant of his office 
has disavowed the limitless power that 
he asserts. That matters. 
As the Supreme Court explained just 
a few years ago: 
[L]ong settled and established practice is a 
consideration of great weight in a proper in-
terpretation of constitutional provisions reg-
ulating the relationship between Congress 
and the President. 
Let’s take a quick tour of the histor-
ical record. To begin at the beginning— 
a sweltering summer in Philadelphia, 
1787—the Framers discussed at length 
the balance between Presidents and 
Congress. Remember, they had just 
fought a bloody war to rid themselves 
of a tyrant, and they were very con-
scious they didn’t want another tyrant. 
When impeachment came up, they 
agreed it would limit the President’s 
authority. But a strong majority of 
Framers saw that as a virtue, not a 
vice. They wanted to empower the 
President but also to keep his power 
from getting out of hand. 
Yet impeachment could not serve 
that role if the House was unable to in-
vestigate the President for suspected 
high crimes and misdemeanors. This 
was recognized early on, starting with 
our very first President. In 1796, the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S553 
January 24, 2020 
House requested that President Wash-
ington provide it sensitive diplomatic 
materials relating to the hugely un-
popular Jay Treaty with Great Britain. 
President Washington declined since 
this request intruded upon his execu-
tive functions. But Washington agreed 
that impeachment would change his 
calculus. In the ensuing debates, it was 
noted on the House floor that Wash-
ington had admitted ‘‘that where the 
House expresses an intention to im-
peach, the right to demand from the 
Executive all papers and information 
in his possession belongs to it.’’ 
‘‘All papers and information.’’ This 
was only the first of many references 
to that point in our constitutional tra-
dition. For example, less than 40 years 
later, in 1833, Justice Joseph Story re-
marked upon the dangers of Presi-
dential obstruction. He wrote: 
The power of impeachment will generally 
be applied to persons holding high offices 
under the government; and it is of great con-
sequence that the President should not have 
the power of preventing a thorough inves-
tigation of their conduct. 
Consistent with this teaching, Presi-
dent Polk later offered his clear and in-
sightful explanation of why Presidents 
must honor all impeachment sub-
poenas. As I mentioned just moments 
ago, he said: 
It may be alleged that the power of im-
peachment belongs to the House of Rep-
resentatives, and that with a view to the ex-
ercise of this power, that House has the right 
to investigate the conduct of all public offi-
cers under the government. This is cheer-
fully admitted. 
Decades later, during our first Presi-
dential impeachment inquiry, Presi-
dent 
Andrew 
Johnson 
recognized 
Congress’s power to thoroughly inves-
tigate him and his executive branch 
subordinates. 
In 1857, for example, the House Judi-
ciary Committee obtained executive 
and Presidential records. The com-
mittee interviewed Cabinet officers and 
Presidential aides about Cabinet meet-
ings and private conversations with the 
President by his top aides and Cabinet 
officials. Multiple witnesses, moreover, 
answered questions about the opinions 
of the President’s, statements made by 
the President, and the advice given to 
the President. There is no evidence 
that Johnson ever asserted any privi-
lege to prevent disclosure of Presi-
dential conversations to the committee 
or failed to comply with any of the 
committee’s requests. 
Thus, in the first 80 years of the Re-
public, Presidents Washington, Polk, 
and Johnson, along with members of 
committees of the House and a Su-
preme Court Justice, all recognized 
that Congress is authorized by the Con-
stitution to investigate grounds for im-
peachment and that Presidents are ob-
ligated to give all information re-
quested. President Trump’s attempt to 
stonewall Congress would have shocked 
those Presidents. 
With only a few exceptions, invoca-
tions of the impeachment power sub-
sided from 1868 to 1972. Yet, even in 
that period, while objecting to ordi-
nary legislative oversight, Presidents 
Ulysses S. Grant, Grover Cleveland, 
and Theodore Roosevelt each noted 
that Congress could obtain key execu-
tive branch documents in an impeach-
ment inquiry. They thus confirm yet 
again that impeachment is different. 
Under the Constitution, it requires full 
compliance. 
Then came Watergate, when Presi-
dent Nixon abused the power of his of-
fice to undermine his political oppo-
nents. But even Nixon—even Nixon— 
understood that he must comply with 
subpoenas for information relating to 
his misconduct. Thus, he stated in 
March 1973, regarding the Senate’s Wa-
tergate investigation: 
All members of the White House staff will 
appear voluntarily when requested by the 
committee. They will testify under oath, and 
they will answer fully all proper questions. 
As a result, many senior White House 
officials 
testified, 
including 
White 
House Counsel John Dean, White House 
Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, and Dep-
uty Assistant to the President Alex-
ander Butterfield. 
In addition, Nixon produced many 
documents in response to congressional 
subpoenas, including notes from meet-
ings with the President. 
As the House Judiciary Committee 
explained at the time, 69 officials had 
been subjected to impeachment inves-
tigations throughout American his-
tory. Yet, ‘‘with the possible exception 
of one minor official who invoked the 
privilege 
against 
self-incrimination, 
not one of them challenged the power 
of the committee conducting the inves-
tigation to compel the production of 
evidence it deemed necessary.’’ 
President 
Nixon’s 
production 
of 
records was incomplete, however, in a 
very important respect: He did not 
produce tape recordings of key Oval Of-
fice conversations. In response, the 
House Judiciary Committee approved 
an Article of Impeachment against the 
President for obstruction of Congress. 
Twenty-four years later, the House 
undertook impeachment proceedings 
against President Clinton. Consistent 
with precedent and entirely unlike 
President Trump, Clinton ‘‘pledged to 
cooperate fully with the [impeach-
ment] investigation.’’ Ultimately, he 
provided written responses to 81 inter-
rogatories from the Judiciary Com-
mittee, and 3 witnesses provided testi-
mony during the Senate trial. 
As this review of the historic record 
proves, Presidents have long recognized 
that the Constitution compels them to 
honor subpoenas served by the House 
in an impeachment inquiry. 
Stated simply, President Trump’s 
categorical blockade of the House—his 
refusal to honor any subpoenas, his 
order that all subpoenas be defied with-
out even knowing what they were—has 
no analog in the history of the Repub-
lic. Nothing even comes close. He has 
engaged in obstruction that several of 
his predecessors have expressly said is 
forbidden and that led to an Article of 
Impeachment against Nixon. 
President Trump is an outlier. He is 
the first and only President ever to de-
clare himself unaccountable and to ig-
nore subpoenas backed by the Con-
stitution’s impeachment power. If he is 
not removed from office and if he is 
permitted to defy the Congress en-
tirely, categorically, and to say that 
subpoenas from Congress in an im-
peachment inquiry are nonsense, then 
we will have lost—the House will have 
lost, and the Senate, certainly, will 
have lost—all power to hold any Presi-
dent accountable. 
This is a determination by President 
Trump that he wants to be all power-
ful. He does not have to respect the 
Congress—he does not have to respect 
the representatives of the people. Only 
his will goes. He is a dictator. This 
must not stand. That is another reason 
he must be removed from office. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Senators, we have now shown 
how the extreme measures President 
Trump took to conceal evidence and 
block witnesses defies the Constitution 
and centuries of historical practice; 
but there is more to this story, and it 
only 
further 
undermines 
President 
Trump’s case. The position he has 
taken is not only baseless as an histor-
ical matter; it is also inconsistent with 
the Justice Department’s stated reason 
for refusing to indict or prosecute 
Presidents. 
The Department of Justice’s unwill-
ingness to indict a sitting President 
creates a danger that the President 
can’t be held accountable by anyone, 
even for grave misconduct. To its cred-
it, the Department of Justice recog-
nized that risk. In its view, ‘‘the con-
stitutionally 
specified 
impeachment 
process ensures that the immunity 
would not place the President ‘above 
the law.’’’ 
This argument by the Justice De-
partment is really important. In justi-
fying its view that a President can’t be 
held criminally liable while in office, 
the DOJ relies on Congress’s ability to 
impeach and remove a President, but 
the Justice Department’s rationale 
falls apart if the ‘‘constitutionally 
specified impeachment process’’ can’t 
function because the President himself 
has obstructed it. 
The Supreme Court correctly noted 
in Nixon v. Fitzgerald—and that is not 
Richard Nixon; it is Judge Nixon— 
‘‘vigilant oversight by Congress’’ is 
necessary to ‘‘make credible the threat 
of impeachment.’’ 
The President should not be treated 
as immune from criminal liability be-
cause he is subject to impeachment but 
then be allowed to sabotage the im-
peachment process itself. That is what 
this President did. That places him 
dangerously above the law and beyond 
the separation of powers. Presidents 
can’t be above the law. Presidents, like 
everyone else, must obey subpoenas 
served in an impeachment inquiry. 
In 1880, the Supreme Court explained: 
‘‘Where the question of such impeach-
ment is before either [House of Con-
gress] acting in its appropriate sphere

on that subject, we see no reason to 
doubt the right to compel the attend-
ance of witnesses, and their answer to 
proper questions, in the same manner 
and by the use of the same means that 
courts of justice can in like cases.’’ 
Almost a century later, Judge John 
Sirica’s influential opinion on the Wa-
tergate ‘‘roadmap’’ in 1974 emphasized 
the special weight assigned to Congress 
in an impeachment. 
He wrote: 
[I]t should not be forgotten that we deal in 
a matter of the most critical moment to the 
Nation, an impeachment investigation in-
volving the President of the United States. 
It would be difficult to conceive of a more 
compelling need than that of this country 
for an unswervingly fair inquiry based on all 
the pertinent information. 
That same year, the Supreme Court 
decided the famous case of Nixon v. 
United States. That is President Nixon. 
I was standing just across the street 
from the Court when the case was 
handed down, and I remember seeing 
the reporters running down those mar-
ble steps, clutching the Court’s unani-
mous decision. That decision forced the 
release of key Oval Office tapes that 
President Nixon had tried to cover up 
by invoking executive privilege. In 
short order, it led to the resignation of 
President Nixon. 
The plaintiff in that case was actu-
ally the special prosecutor, Leon Ja-
worski, who had been appointed to in-
vestigate the Watergate burglary and 
who had issued subpoenas for the Nixon 
tapes. The Supreme Court upheld these 
subpoenas against President Nixon’s 
claim of executive privilege. It rea-
soned that his asserted interest in con-
fidentiality could not overcome the 
constitutionally grounded interest in 
the fair administration of criminal jus-
tice. 
In reaching that conclusion, the 
Court said: 
The ends of criminal justice would be de-
feated if judgments were to be founded on a 
partial or speculative presentation of the 
facts. The very integrity of the judicial sys-
tem and public confidence in the system de-
pend on full disclosure of all the facts, with-
in the framework of the rules of evidence. 
That reasoning, which was a unani-
mous decision by the Supreme Court in 
the Nixon tapes case, applies with full 
force—indeed, greater force—to im-
peachments. 
The House Judiciary Committee rec-
ognized this when it approved an Arti-
cle of Impeachment against President 
Nixon for obstruction of Congress. 
It reasoned as follows: 
If a generalized Presidential interest in 
confidentiality cannot prevail over ‘‘the fun-
damental demand of due process of law in 
the fair administration of justice,’’ neither 
can it be permitted to prevail over the funda-
mental need to obtain all the relevant facts 
in the impeachment process. Whatever the 
limits of legislative power in other con-
texts—and whatever need may otherwise 
exist for preserving the confidentiality of 
Presidential conversations—in the context of 
an impeachment proceeding the balance was 
struck in the favor of the power of inquiry. 
Accordingly, President Trump’s con-
duct is unprecedented and, actually, of-
fensive to the precedents, and it is in-
consistent with his duty—his oath—to 
faithfully execute the laws. That obli-
gation to see that the laws are faith-
fully executed is not just about enforc-
ing statutes; it is a duty to be faithful 
to the Constitution—every part of it— 
as stated in the text and understood 
across history, and it is a duty that he 
has violated by obstructing Congress 
here. 
I want to make one additional point 
regarding the judiciary. 
Presidents have an obligation to 
comply with Congress’s impeachment 
inquiry regardless of whether a court 
has reviewed the request. We make this 
point even though, I think, President 
Trump’s lawyers would be making a 
mistake to raise it. After all, the Presi-
dent’s lawyers can’t have it both ways. 
They can’t argue here that we must go 
to court and then argue in court that 
our case can’t be heard. 
Anyway, the House’s ‘‘sole Power of 
impeachment’’ wouldn’t be ‘‘sole’’ or 
much of a ‘‘power’’ if the House could 
not investigate the President at all 
without first spending years litigating 
before the third branch of government. 
It would frustrate the Constitution for 
the House to depend entirely on the ju-
diciary to advance its impeachment-re-
lated investigatory powers. 
Consistent with this understanding, 
before President Trump, the House had 
never before filed a lawsuit to require 
testimony or documents in a Presi-
dential impeachment. We didn’t have 
to. No President had ever issued a blan-
ket ban on compliance with House sub-
poenas or challenged the House to find 
a way around his unlawful order. In 
this strange and unprecedented situa-
tion, it is appropriate for Congress to 
reach its own judgment that the Presi-
dent is obstructing the exercise of its 
constitutional power. 
As 
then-Representative 
LINDSEY 
GRAHAM explained in 1998 during the 
Clinton proceedings, where we served 
together on the Judiciary Committee: 
‘‘The day Richard Nixon failed to an-
swer that subpoena is the day he was 
subject to impeachment because he 
took the power from Congress over the 
impeachment process away from Con-
gress, and he became the judge and 
jury.’’ 
There is still another reason it would 
be wrong and dangerous to insist that 
the House cannot take action without 
involving the courts, and that reason is 
delay. 
Consider just three lawsuits filed by 
House committees over the past two 
decades to enforce subpoenas against 
senior executive branch officials. I 
served on the Judiciary Committee 
when we decided that we needed to 
hear from former White House Counsel 
Harriet Miers. 
In Committee on the Judiciary v. 
Miers, the Judiciary Committee tried 
to enforce a subpoena that required her 
to give testimony about the conten-
tious firing of nine U.S. attorneys. The 
committee served the subpoena in 2007. 
We negotiated—as the courts indicate 
you should—with the White House, and 
we finally filed suit in March of 2008. 
We won a favorable district court order 
in July 2008, but we didn’t receive tes-
timony from Miers until June of 2009. 
That was 2 years. 
In Committee on Oversight and Gov-
ernment Reform v. Holder, the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government 
Reform tried to force Attorney General 
Eric Holder to produce additional docu-
ments relating to the so-called Oper-
ation Fast and Furious. The committee 
served the subpoena in October 2011. 
They filed suit in August 2012. They 
won a series of orders requiring the 
production of documents, but the first 
such order did not issue until August of 
2014—nearly 3 years. 
In Committee on the Judiciary v. 
McGahn, the House Judiciary Com-
mittee sought to enforce a subpoena to 
require 
White 
House 
Counsel 
Don 
McGahn to give testimony regarding 
matters relating to the special coun-
sel’s investigation. We served that sub-
poena in April of last year. We filed 
suit in August of last year. We won a 
favorable district court order in No-
vember of last year. The court of ap-
peals stayed that ruling and didn’t 
hear 
arguments 
until 
early 
this 
month—with an opinion and, poten-
tially, a Supreme Court application 
likely to follow. We will likely not 
have an answer this year. 
Sometimes courts move quickly, but, 
here, they have not—not at all. Even 
when the House urges expedited action, 
it usually takes years, not months, to 
get evidence through judicial pro-
ceedings. 
The President can’t put off impeach-
ment for years by ordering total defi-
ance of the House and then insist that 
the House go to court even as he argues 
that it can’t go to court. That is espe-
cially true when the President doesn’t 
just raise one or two objections to spe-
cific subpoenas but orders a blanket, 
governmentwide coverup of all evi-
dence. 
That kind of order makes this clear. 
The President sees himself completely 
immune 
from 
any 
accountability— 
above 
the 
law. 
It 
reveals 
his 
pretentions, really, to absolute power. 
It confirms he must be removed from 
office. 
Here is the key point: President 
Trump’s obstruction of Congress is not 
merely unprecedented and wrong; it is 
also a high crime and misdemeanor, as 
the Framers used and understood that 
phrase, warranting his immediate re-
moval from office. To see why, let’s re-
turn to first principles. 
As the Framers deliberated in Phila-
delphia, George Mason posed a pro-
found question: ‘‘Shall any man be 
above justice?’’ 
That question wasn’t a hypothetical. 
The Framers had just rebelled against 
England, where one man, the King, was 
in fact above justice. 
By authorizing Congress to remove 
Presidents for egregious misconduct,

the Framers rejected that model. Un-
like 
Britain’s 
King, 
the 
President 
would answer to Congress and, thus, to 
the Nation, if he engaged in serious 
wrongdoing, because the impeachment 
power exists not to punish the Presi-
dent but to check Presidents. It can’t 
function if Presidents are free to ignore 
all 
congressional 
investigation 
and 
oversight. 
An 
impeachment 
scholar, 
Frank 
Bowman, said this: 
Without the power to compel compliance 
with subpoenas and the concomitant right to 
impeach a president for refusal to comply, 
the impeachment power would be nullified. 
So the consequences of Presidential 
obstruction go beyond any particular 
impeachment inquiry. They go to the 
heart of the impeachment power itself. 
They weaken our shield against a dan-
gerous or corrupt President. 
Now, of course, Presidents are still 
free to raise privacy, national security, 
or other concerns in the course of an 
impeachment inquiry. There is room 
for good-faith negotiations over what 
evidence will be disclosed, although 
there is a strong presumption in favor 
of full compliance with congressional 
subpoenas. 
But when a President abuses his of-
fice, abuses his power to completely 
defy House investigators in an im-
peachment inquiry, when he does that 
without lawful cause or excuse, he at-
tacks the Constitution itself. When he 
does that, he confirms that he sees 
himself as above the law. 
President Nixon’s case is inform-
ative. As noted, President Nixon let his 
senior officials testify, he produced 
many documents. He did not direct 
anything like a blanket indiscriminate 
block of the House’s impeachment in-
quiry. Still, he did defy subpoenas 
seeking records and recordings of the 
Oval Office. 
Now, President Nixon claimed that 
his noncompliance was legally defen-
sible. He invoked the doctrine of execu-
tive privilege. The judiciary rejected 
that excuse. 
The committee emphasized that ‘‘the 
doctrine of separation of powers cannot 
justify the withholding of information 
from an impeachment inquiry.’’ After 
all, ‘‘the very purpose of such an in-
quiry is to permit the House, acting on 
behalf of the people, to curb the ex-
cesses of another branch, in this in-
stance the Executive.’’ 
‘‘Whatever the limits of legislative 
power in other contexts—and whatever 
need may otherwise exist for pre-
serving the confidentiality of Presi-
dential conversations—in the context 
of an impeachment proceeding the bal-
ance was struck in favor of the power 
of inquiry when the impeachment pro-
vision was written into the Constitu-
tion. 
Now, ultimately, the committee ap-
proved an article against Nixon be-
cause he sought to prevent the House 
from exercising its constitutional duty. 
Article III charged Nixon with abus-
ing his power by interfering with the 
discharge of the Judiciary Committee’s 
responsibility to investigate fully and 
completely whether he had committed 
high crimes and misdemeanors. Presi-
dent Nixon’s third Article of Impeach-
ment explained it this way: 
In refusing to produce these papers and 
things, Richard M. Nixon, substituting his 
judgment as to what materials were nec-
essary for the inquiry, interposed the powers 
of the Presidency against the lawful sub-
poenas of the House of Representatives, 
thereby assuming to himself functions and 
judgments necessary to the exercise of the 
sole power of impeachment vested by the 
Constitution in the House of Representa-
tives. 
In all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted 
in a manner contrary to his trust as Presi-
dent and subversive of constitutional govern-
ment, to the great prejudice of the cause of 
law and justice, and to the manifest injury of 
the people of the United States. . . . 
President Nixon’s case powerfully 
supports the conclusion that Presi-
dential defiance of a House impeach-
ment inquiry constitutes high crimes 
and misdemeanors. 
You know, I have been thinking a lot 
about the Founders and have been re-
reading the Constitution and the notes 
from the Constitutional Convention. It 
was just a little over 230 years ago that 
they met in Philadelphia, not too far 
from here. They had been at it for a 
long time. They didn’t know whether 
the constitution they were going to 
write would sustain freedom, but they 
were trying to create a completely dif-
ferent type of government. 
On July 20, Governor Morris said 
this: 
The magistrate is not the king. The people 
are the king. 
George Mason, of Virginia, on that 
same day said: 
Shall any man be above Justice? Above all, 
shall that man be above it who can commit 
the most extensive injustice?’’ 
And Elbridge Gerry argued that he 
hoped that the maxim that the chief 
magistrate could do no wrong ‘‘would 
never be adopted here.’’ 
Now, finally, on September 8, they 
adopted the impeachment clause in the 
U.S. Constitution, but I hope that we 
will remember the admonition that we 
should never accept the fact that the 
magistrate—the President—can do no 
wrong. 
They crafted the Constitution to pro-
tect our liberty and the liberty of those 
who will follow us. 
Professor 
Noah 
Feldman 
talked 
about the Constitution in his testi-
mony before the House. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Noah FELDMAN. A President who says, as 
this President did say, I will not cooperate in 
any way, shape, or form with your process, 
robs a coordinate branch of government, he 
robs the House of Representatives of its 
basic constitutional power of impeachment. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. You know, a 
President who does that also endangers 
the American people by stripping away 
the 
Constitution’s 
final 
safeguard 
against Presidents who abuse power 
and harm the Nation. Such a President 
acts like a King, which the Founders 
were fighting against. That is what 
they wrote out of the Constitution. A 
President cannot be immune from 
oversight, accountability, and even 
simple justice in the exercise of the 
powers entrusted to him. 
We can’t let that stand in this case. 
The President must forfeit the powers 
that he has abused and be removed 
from office. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, counsel for the President, my 
colleagues, the American people who 
are assembled here today, I think we 
have our next break scheduled for 
within the hour, and so I find myself in 
the unenviable position of being the 
only thing standing between you and 
our dinner. But be not discouraged be-
cause I am going to try to follow the 
advice of a former Sunday school 
teacher of mine. I grew up in the Cor-
nerstone Baptist Church in Brooklyn. 
She said: Jeffries, on the question of 
public 
presentations, 
be 
brief, 
be 
bright, and be gone. 
And so I am going to try to do my 
best. 
Presidents are required to comply 
with 
impeachment 
subpoenas. 
This 
President has completely defied them. 
That conduct alone is a high crime and 
misdemeanor. 
The facts here are not really in dis-
pute. President Trump’s defense ap-
pears to be: I can do whatever I want to 
do. Only I can fix it. I am the chosen 
one. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. Then I have an Article 
II, where I have the right to do whatever I 
want as president. Nobody knows the system 
better than me. Which is why I alone can fix 
it. Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen 
one. Somebody had to do it. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Is that who 
we are as a democracy? 
President Trump can’t address the 
substance of our case. He therefore 
complains about process, but these pro-
cedural complaints are baseless ex-
cuses, and they do not justify his at-
tempts to hide the truth from Congress 
and from the American people. 
The President’s arguments fail for 
four simple reasons. First, the House, 
not the President, has the ‘‘sole Power 
of Impeachment’’ and the soul power 
‘‘to determine the Rules of its Pro-
ceedings.’’ That is article I, section 2, 
of the Constitution. 
Second, 
President 
Trump’s 
‘‘due 
process’’ argument has no basis in law, 
no basis in fact, no basis in the Con-
stitution. President Trump may not 
preemptively deny any and all coopera-
tion to the House and then assert that 
the House’s procedures are illegitimate 
because they lack his cooperation. 
Third, President Trump’s claim that 
he is being treated differently com-
pletely lacks merit. Despite what he 
contends, the House provided President 
Trump with greater protection than 
what was given to both President 
Nixon and President Clinton. The fact

that President Trump failed to take 
advantage of these procedural protec-
tions does not mean they did not exist. 
President Trump is not the first 
President to complain about House 
procedures. He won’t be the last. He is 
not the first one to challenge the mo-
tives of any investigation or certainly 
an impeachment inquiry. Such com-
plaints are standard operating proce-
dure from the article II executive 
branch. 
President Johnson, President Nixon, 
President Clinton had plenty of com-
plaints, but no President—no Presi-
dent, no President—has treated such 
objections as a basis for withholding 
evidence, 
let 
alone 
categorically 
defying every single subpoena—none— 
except Donald John Trump. 
Finally, the obligation to comply 
with an impeachment subpoena is 
unyielding. It does not dissipate be-
cause the President believes House 
committees should invite different wit-
nesses, give his defenders unfettered 
subpoena power, or involve his personal 
lawyers at the deposition stage of the 
process, when that has never been 
done. 
And if a President can defy Congress 
on such fragile grounds, then, it is dif-
ficult to imagine why any future Presi-
dent would ever comply with an im-
peachment or investigative subpoena 
again. 
Now, throughout our history, im-
peachments have been rare, and the 
Supreme Court has made clear that it 
is wary of intruding on matters of im-
peachment. This, of course, leaves 
room for interbranch negotiation, but 
it does not allow the President to en-
gage in blanket defiance. 
President Trump’s objections are not 
genuinely rooted in the law. They are 
not good-faith legal arguments. We 
know that because President Trump 
said early on he would fight all sub-
poenas. We know that because he de-
clared the impeachment inquiry ille-
gitimate before it even adopted any 
procedures; we know that because he 
has denounced every single effort to in-
vestigate him as a witch hunt; and we 
know that because he never even 
claimed executive privilege during the 
entire impeachment proceeding. 
President Trump’s first excuse for 
obstructing Congress is his asserted be-
lief that he did nothing wrong—that 
his 
July 
25 
call 
with 
President 
Zelensky was ‘‘perfect.’’ 
In the October 8 letter sent by his 
Counsel, President Trump asserted the 
prerogative to defy all House sub-
poenas because he has declared his own 
innocence. As Mr. Cipollone put it, at 
President Trump’s behest, ‘‘the Presi-
dent did nothing wrong,’’ and ‘‘there is 
no basis for an impeachment inquiry.’’ 
Yes, the White House Counsel includes 
this in a formal letter to the House, 
defying every single subpoena. 
As we have shown in our discussion 
of the first Article of Impeachment, 
these claims of innocence are baseless. 
They lack merit. We have provided 
overwhelming evidence of President 
Trump’s guilt. 
The President cannot unlawfully ob-
struct a House impeachment inquiry 
because he sees no need to be inves-
tigated. One of the most sacred prin-
ciples of justice is that no man should 
be the judge in his own case, and yet 
that is exactly what President Trump 
has been determined to do. But this is 
America. He cannot be judge, jury, and 
executioner. Moreover, the President 
cannot simply claim innocence and 
then walk away from a constitu-
tionally mandated process. 
Even President Nixon did not do 
that, as we have previously estab-
lished. Congress has a constitutional 
responsibility to serve as a check and 
balance on an out-of-control executive 
branch. Our responsibility is not to 
this President; it is to the American 
people. 
Blanket Presidential defiance would 
bring a swift halt to all congressional 
oversight of the Executive. That prin-
ciple would have authorized categor-
ical obstruction in the impeachments 
of President Johnson, President Nixon, 
and President Clinton. In each of those 
cases, the House was controlled by a 
different party than the Presidency, 
and the President attacked those in-
quiries as partisan. Yet those Presi-
dents did not view their concerns with 
excessive partisanship as a basis for 
defying every single subpoena. 
The purpose of an impeachment in-
quiry is for the House to collect evi-
dence to determine, on behalf of the 
American people, whether the Presi-
dent may have committed an impeach-
able offense because the Constitution 
vests the House alone with the ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment.’’ 
A President who serves as the judge 
of his own innocence is not acting as a 
President. That is a dictator. That is a 
despot. That is not democracy. 
The President also believes, it ap-
pears, that blanket obstruction is jus-
tified because the House did not ex-
pressly adopt a resolution authorizing 
an impeachment inquiry or properly 
delegate such investigatory powers to 
its committees. 
The full House voted in January in 
advance of the inquiry to adopt rules 
authorizing committees to conduct in-
vestigations, issue subpoenas, gather 
documents, and hear testimony. 
Beginning in the spring and summer 
of 2019, evidence came to light that 
President Trump and his associates 
might have been seeking the assistance 
of 
another 
foreign 
government, 
Ukraine, to influence the upcoming 
2020 election. 
On September 9, the House inves-
tigating committees announced they 
were launching a joint investigation. 
They requested records from the White 
House and the Department of State. 
This investigation was consistent with 
all rules approved by the full House. At 
the same time, evidence emerged that 
the President may have attempted to 
cover up his actions and prevent the 
transmission of a whistleblower com-
plaint to the Intelligence Committees 
of the Senate and the House. 
Given the gravity of these allega-
tions and the immediacy of the threat 
to the next Presidential election, the 
Speaker of the House, a constitutional 
officer, explicitly named in article I, 
announced on September 24 that the 
House would begin a formal impeach-
ment inquiry. There is nothing in the 
Constitution, nothing in Federal law, 
nothing in Supreme Court jurispru-
dence that required a formal vote at 
the time. 
The President has put forth fake ar-
guments about process because he can-
not defend the substance of these alle-
gations. 
Following the announcement of the 
impeachment inquiry, the House inves-
tigating committees issued additional 
requests—and then subpoenas—for doc-
uments and testimony. The commit-
tees ‘‘made clear that this information 
would be collected as part of the 
House’s 
impeachment 
inquiry 
and 
shared among the Committees, as well 
as with the Committee on the Judici-
ary as appropriate. 
Then, on October 31, the full House 
voted to approve H. Res. 660, which di-
rected the House committees to ‘‘con-
tinue their ongoing investigations as 
part of the existing . . . inquiry into 
whether sufficient grounds exist for the 
House of Representatives to exercise 
its Constitutional power to impeach 
Donald John Trump.’’ 
In addition to affirming the ongoing 
House impeachment inquiry, H. Res. 
660 set forth procedures for open hear-
ings in the Intelligence Committee and 
for additional proceedings in the Judi-
ciary Committee. 
Every step in this process was fully 
consistent with the Constitution, the 
rules of the House, and House prece-
dent. 
The House’s autonomy to structure 
its own proceedings for an impeach-
ment inquiry is grounded in the Con-
stitution. The President’s principal ar-
gument to the contrary is that no com-
mittee of the House is permitted to in-
vestigate any Presidential misconduct 
until the full House acted. 
As a Federal district court recently 
confirmed, the notion that a full House 
vote is required to authorize an im-
peachment inquiry ‘‘has no textual 
support in the U.S. Constitution [or] 
the governing rules of the House.’’ 
The investigations into misconduct 
by Presidents Andrew Johnson, Nixon, 
and Clinton all began prior to the 
House’s consideration and approval of a 
resolution authorizing the investiga-
tions. 
Recently, under Republican control, 
the Judiciary Committee considered 
the impeachment of the Commissioner 
of the Internal Revenue Service fol-
lowing a referral from another com-
mittee and absent a full vote of the 
House for an impeachment inquiry. 
There is no merit to President 
Trump’s argument that the full House

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S557 
January 24, 2020 
had to vote. The sequence of events in 
this particular case largely tracks 
those in the Nixon proceedings. There, 
the 
House 
Judiciary’s 
proceedings 
began in October of 1973, when resolu-
tions calling for President Nixon’s im-
peachment were introduced in the 
House and referred to the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Over the next several months, the 
committee investigated the Watergate 
break-in and coverup, among other 
matters, using its existing investiga-
tory authorities. The committee also 
hired a special counsel and other attor-
neys to assist in these efforts. Most im-
portantly, all of this occurred before 
the House approved a resolution direct-
ing the Judiciary Committee to inves-
tigate whether grounds to impeach 
Richard Nixon existed. 
In this instance, the committees 
began the investigation with their ex-
isting powers authorized by the full 
House. That course of events is en-
tirely consistent with the Richard 
Nixon precedent. It is also common 
sense. After all, before voting to con-
duct an impeachment inquiry, the 
House must ascertain the nature and 
seriousness of the allegations and the 
scope of the inquiry that may follow 
their actions. 
President Trump’s second excuse also 
fails. Let’s now address the President’s 
so-called due process and fairness argu-
ment. The President has phrased his 
complaints in the language of ‘‘due 
process.’’ He has complained that the 
procedures were not fair, even though 
they reflect prior practice and strike a 
reasonable 
balance 
between 
Presi-
dential involvement on the one hand 
and the House’s obligation to find the 
truth on the other. 
Presidents come and Presidents go. 
They have all sharply criticized House 
procedures, but no President has ever 
treated those objections as a basis for 
complete defiance. No President has 
ever done that. 
In the context of a House impeach-
ment inquiry, it is fair to say that the 
President is a suspect—a suspect who 
may have committed a high crime or 
misdemeanor. He cannot tell the detec-
tives investigating the possible con-
stitutional crime what they should do 
in the context of their investigation. 
In the President’s October 8 letter, 
Mr. Cipollone complains that he was 
denied ‘‘the most basic protections de-
manded by due process under the Con-
stitution and by fundamental fair-
ness,’’ including ‘‘the right to cross-ex-
amine witnesses, to call witnesses, to 
receive transcripts of testimony, to 
have access to evidence,’’ and ‘‘to have 
counsel present.’’ 
It sounds terrible, but it is not accu-
rate. 
The President appears to have mis-
taken the initial phases of the im-
peachment inquiry for a full-blown 
trial. The trial phase of the impeach-
ment inquiry is taking place right now. 
Chairman Peter Rodino of the Judici-
ary Committee once observed, as it re-
lated to the impeachment proceedings 
against President Nixon, that ‘‘it is not 
a right but a privilege or a courtesy’’ 
for 
the 
President 
to 
participate 
through counsel. 
An impeachment inquiry is not a 
trial; rather, it entails a collection and 
evaluation of facts before a trial oc-
curs. In that respect, the House acts 
like a grand jury or a prosecutor inves-
tigating the evidence to determine 
whether charges are warranted or not. 
Federal grand juries and prosecutors do 
not allow targets of their investigation 
to coordinate witness testimony. The 
protections that the President labeled 
as ‘‘due process’’ do not apply here be-
cause 
those 
entitlements 
that 
he 
sought, many of which were actually 
afforded to him—but those entitle-
ments that he sought would not nec-
essarily be available to any American 
in a grand jury investigation. 
Moreover, it should be clear that the 
House, notwithstanding this frame-
work, has typically provided a level of 
transparency in impeachment inquir-
ies, particularly as it relates to Presi-
dents. 
In past impeachment inquiries, this 
has typically meant that the principal 
evidence relied upon by the House Ju-
diciary Committee is disclosed to the 
President and to the public, though 
some evidence in past proceedings has 
actually remained confidential. 
The President has typically been 
given an opportunity to participate in 
the proceedings at a stage when evi-
dence has been fully gathered and is 
presented to the Judiciary Committee. 
President Trump was given the chance 
to do that in this case, but he declined. 
Presidents have been entitled to 
present evidence that is relevant to the 
inquiry and to request that relevant 
witnesses be called. President Trump 
was given the chance to do that in the 
House impeachment inquiry before the 
Judiciary Committee, but he declined. 
Under H. Res. 660, President Trump 
received procedural protections not 
just equal to but in some instances 
greater than that afforded to Presi-
dents Nixon and Clinton. So let’s be 
clear. The privileges described in the 
October 8 letter were in fact offered to 
President Trump as they had been in 
prior 
impeachment 
inquiries. 
The 
President was able to review all evi-
dence relied on by the House inves-
tigating committees, including evi-
dence that the minority’s public report 
identified as favorable to President 
Trump. 
During the Judiciary Committee pro-
ceedings, the President had opportuni-
ties to present evidence, call witnesses, 
have counsel present to raise objec-
tions, cross-examine witnesses, and re-
spond to the evidence raised against 
him. 
As the Rules Committee report ac-
companying H. Res. 660 noted, these 
privileges are ‘‘commensurate with the 
inquiry process followed in the cases 
of’’ 
Nixon 
and 
Clinton. 
President 
Trump simply chose not to avail him-
self of what had been afforded to him. 
The fact that President Trump de-
clined to take advantage of these pro-
tections does not excuse his blanket, 
unconstitutional obstruction. Unlike 
the Nixon and Clinton impeachments, 
in this particular instance, the argu-
ment that the President has made—the 
argument that he has made as it re-
lates to the investigative process—is 
not analogous. 
In this case, the House conducted a 
significant portion of the factual inves-
tigation itself because no independent 
prosecutor was appointed to inves-
tigate the allegations of wrongdoing 
against President Trump. Attorney 
General William Barr refused to au-
thorize a criminal investigation into 
the serious allegations of misconduct 
against the President. They tried to 
whitewash the whole sordid affair. Left 
to their own devices, the House inves-
tigating committees followed standard 
best practices for investigations, con-
sistent with the law enforcement inves-
tigation into Presidents Nixon and 
Clinton, in advance of their impeach-
ments. 
The committees released transcripts 
of all interviews and depositions con-
ducted during the investigation. Dur-
ing the investigation, more than 100 
Members of the House participated in 
the so-called closed-door proceedings— 
more than 100 Members of the House, 47 
of whom were Republicans. They all 
had the opportunity to ask questions. 
They all had the opportunity to ask 
questions with equal time. 
The 
Intelligence 
Committee 
held 
public hearings with 12 of the key wit-
nesses testifying, including several re-
quested by the House Republicans. It is 
important to note that the very same 
procedures in H. Res. 660 were sup-
ported by Acting White House Chief of 
Staff Mick Mulvaney when he served as 
a member of the Oversight Committee 
and 
by 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Mike 
Pompeo when he served as a member of 
the Select Committee on Benghazi. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOWDY. I can just tell you in the pri-
vate interviews there is never any of what 
you saw Thursday. It is one hour on the Re-
publican side, one hour on the Democrat 
side—which is why you are going to see the 
next two dozen interviews done privately. 
Look at the other investigations being done 
right now. The Lois Lerner investigation 
that was just announced, was that public or 
private? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. If this proc-
ess was good enough for other Presi-
dents, why isn’t it good enough for 
President Trump? 
Representative Gowdy finished that 
statement by saying: ‘‘The private ones 
have always produced the best re-
sults.’’ ‘‘The private ones,’’ according 
to Trey Gowdy, ‘‘have always produced 
the best results.’’ 
President Trump complained that his 
counsel was not afforded the oppor-
tunity to participate during the Intel 
Committee’s proceedings. But neither 
President Nixon nor President Clinton 
were permitted to have counsel partici-
pate in the initial fact-gathering stages

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S558 
January 24, 2020 
when they were investigated by special 
counsel, independent counsel. 
President Nixon certainly had no at-
torney present when the prosecutors 
and grand juries began collecting evi-
dence about Watergate and related 
matters. President Nixon did not have 
an attorney present in this distin-
guished body when the Senate Select 
Committee on Watergate began inter-
viewing witnesses and holding public 
hearings. Nor did President Clinton 
have an attorney present when pros-
ecutors from the Office of Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr deposed wit-
nesses and elicited their testimony be-
fore a grand jury. 
President Trump’s attorney could 
have cross-examined the Intel Commit-
tee’s counsel during his presentation of 
evidence before the House Judiciary 
Committee. That would have func-
tioned as the equivalent opportunity 
afforded to President Clinton to have 
his 
counsel 
cross-examine 
Kenneth 
Starr, which he did, at length. 
President Trump was provided a level 
of transparency and the opportunity to 
participate consistent with the highest 
standards of due process and fairness 
given to other Presidents who found 
themselves in the midst of an impeach-
ment inquiry. 
The President—and I am winding 
down—the President’s next procedural 
complaint is that it was unconstitu-
tional to exclude agency counsel from 
participating in congressional deposi-
tions. The basis for the rule excluding 
agency counsel is straightforward. It 
prevents agency officials who are di-
rectly implicated in the abuses Con-
gress is investigating from trying to 
prevent their own employees from 
coming forward to tell Congress and 
the American people the truth. It is 
common sense. The rule protects the 
rights of witnesses by allowing them to 
be accompanied in depositions by per-
sonal counsel, a right that was afforded 
to all of the witnesses who appeared in 
this matter. 
Agency attorneys have been excluded 
from congressional depositions of exec-
utive branch officials for decades under 
both Republicans and Democrats, in-
cluding Republican Chairman Dan Bur-
ton, Republican Chairman Darrell Issa, 
Republican Chairman Jason Chaffetz, 
Republican Chairman Trey Gowdy, Re-
publican Chairman KEVIN BRADY, and 
Republican Chairman Jeb Hensarling, 
just to name a few. 
Again, the Constitution provides the 
House with the sole power of impeach-
ment and the sole authority to deter-
mine the rules of its proceedings, 
which were fair to all involved. Given 
the 
Constitution’s 
clarity 
on 
this 
point, the President’s argument that 
he can engage in blanket obstruction is 
just dead wrong. 
President Trump also objects that 
the House minority lacked sufficient 
subpoena rights. But the subpoena 
rules that were applied in the Trump 
impeachment inquiry were put into 
place by my good friends and col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
House Republicans, when they were in 
the majority. We are playing by the 
same rules devised by our Republican 
colleagues. 
President Nixon did not engage in 
blanket obstruction. President Clinton 
did not engage in blanket obstruction. 
No President of the United States has 
ever acted this way. 
Lastly, we should reject President 
Trump’s suggestion that he can con-
ceal all evidence of misconduct based 
on unspecified confidentiality inter-
ests. Those are his exact words, ‘‘con-
fidentiality interests.’’ Not once in the 
entire impeachment inquiry did he 
ever actually invoke executive privi-
lege. 
Perhaps that is because executive 
privilege cannot be invoked to conceal 
evidence of wrongdoing. Perhaps that 
is because executive privilege does not 
permit blanket obstruction that in-
cludes blocking documents and wit-
nesses 
from 
the 
entire 
executive 
branch. 
Perhaps 
President 
Trump 
didn’t invoke executive privilege be-
cause it has never been accepted as a 
sufficient basis for completely and to-
tally defying all impeachment inquir-
ies and subpoenas. Or perhaps Presi-
dent Trump didn’t invoke executive 
privilege 
because 
when 
President 
Nixon did so, he lost decisively, unani-
mously, clearly before the Supreme 
Court. 
Whatever 
the 
explanation, 
President Trump never invoked execu-
tive privilege. So it is not a credible 
defense to his obstruction of Congress. 
President Trump has lastly suggested 
that his obstruction is justified be-
cause his top aides are ‘‘absolutely im-
mune’’ from being compelled to testify 
before Congress. Every Federal court 
to consider the so-called doctrine of 
‘‘absolute immunity’’ has rejected it. 
In 2008, a Federal court rejected an 
assertion by the 43rd President of the 
United States that White House Coun-
sel Harriet Miers was immune from 
being compelled to testify, noting that 
the President had failed to point to a 
single judicial opinion to justify that 
claim. 
And on November 25 of last year, an-
other Federal judge rejected President 
Trump’s claim of absolute immunity 
for former White House Counsel Don 
McGahn. The court concluded: 
Executive branch officials are not abso-
lutely immune from compulsory congres-
sional process—no matter how many times 
the Executive branch has asserted as much 
over the years—even if the President ex-
pressly directs such officials [not to comply]. 
The court added: ‘‘[Simply stated], 
the primary takeaway from the past 
250 [-some-odd] years of recorded Amer-
ican history is that Presidents are not 
kings.’’ 
The President is not a King. 
President Trump tried to cheat. He 
got caught, and then he worked hard to 
cover it up. He must be held account-
able for abusing his power. He must be 
held accountable for obstructing Con-
gress. He must be held accountable for 
breaking his promise to the American 
people. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
My foreign policy will always put the in-
terests of the American people and American 
security above all else. Has to be first, has to 
be. That will be the foundation of every sin-
gle decision that I will make. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. What does 
it mean to put America First? America 
is a great country, but, above all else, 
I think America is an idea—a precious 
idea. It is an idea that has withstood 
the test of time—an enduring idea— 
year after year, decade after decade, 
century after century, as we continue a 
long, necessary, and majestic march 
toward a more perfect Union. America 
is an idea: one person, one vote; liberty 
and justice for all; equal protection 
under the law; government of the peo-
ple, by the people, and for the people; 
the preeminence of the rule of law. 
America is an idea. We can either de-
fend that idea or we can abandon it. 
God help us all if we choose to abandon 
it. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
we will take a 30-minute break for din-
ner. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, at 6:45 p.m. 
the Senate, sitting as a Court of Im-
peachment, recessed until 7:32 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I have spoken with 
Congressman SCHIFF and his team, and 
it looks like we have a couple more 
hours. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, counsel 
for the President, impeachment exists 
not to inflict personal punishment for 
past wrongdoing but, rather, to protect 
against future Presidential misconduct 
that would endanger democracy and 
the rule of law. 
President Trump remains a threat in 
at least three fundamental ways: 
First, he continues to assert in court 
and elsewhere that nobody in the U.S. 
Government can investigate him for 
wrongdoing, making him unaccount-
able. 
Second, his conduct here is not a one- 
off; it is a pattern of soliciting foreign 
interference in our elections to his own 
advantage and then using the powers of 
his office to stop anyone who dares to 
investigate. 
Finally, the President’s obstruction 
is very much a constitutional crime in 
progress, harming Congress, as it delib-
erates these very proceedings, and the 
American people, who deserve to know 
the facts. 
A President who believes he can get 
away with anything and can use his of-
fice to conceal evidence of abuse 
threatens us all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S559 
January 24, 2020 
President Trump is the first Presi-
dent in U.S. history to say he is im-
mune from any effort to examine his 
conduct or check his power. He claims 
he is completely immune from crimi-
nal indictment and prosecution while 
serving as President. He claims he can 
commit any crime—even shoot some-
one on Fifth Avenue, as he has joked 
about—with impunity. The President’s 
own lawyers have argued in court that 
he cannot even be investigated for vio-
lating the law under any circumstance. 
No President of either party has ever 
made claims like this. 
If an investigation somehow does un-
cover misconduct by the President, as 
this investigation has done, the Presi-
dent believes he can simply quash it. 
He claims the right to end Federal law 
enforcement investigations for any 
reason—or none at all—even when 
there is credible evidence of his own 
wrongdoing. 
Added together, the President’s posi-
tions amount to a license to do any-
thing he wants. No court has ever ac-
cepted this view and for good reason: 
Our Founders created a system in 
which all people—even Presidents—are 
bound by the law and accountable for 
their actions. 
In addition to claiming that he is im-
mune from criminal process, President 
Trump contends that he is not ac-
countable to either Congress or the ju-
diciary. He has invoked bizarre legal 
theories to justify defying congres-
sional investigations. He has argued 
that Congress is forbidden from having 
the courts intervene when executive 
branch 
officials 
disregard 
its 
sub-
poenas. He has sued to block third par-
ties from complying with congressional 
subpoenas. 
Perhaps most remarkably, President 
Trump has claimed that Congress can-
not investigate his misconduct outside 
of an impeachment inquiry, while si-
multaneously claiming that Congress 
cannot investigate his misconduct in 
an impeachment inquiry. Of course, 
President Trump considers any inquiry 
to be illegitimate if he thinks he did 
nothing wrong, doubts the motives of 
Congress, or decides that he would pre-
fer a different set of rules. 
Let’s review the President’s position. 
He can’t be investigated for crimes. He 
can end any Federal law enforcement 
investigation into him. He is immune 
from any State law enforcement inves-
tigation. Neither he nor his aides can 
be subpoenaed. He can reject subpoenas 
based on broad, novel, and even re-
jected theories. When he does reject 
subpoenas, Congress is not allowed to 
sue him, but he is allowed to sue to 
block others from complying with con-
gressional subpoenas. Congress defi-
nitely can’t investigate him outside of 
an impeachment inquiry, and, again, it 
can’t investigate him as part of one. 
The bottom line is that the President 
truly believes that he is above the law. 
This is not our system, and it never has 
been. The President is a constitutional 
officer. Unlike a King, he is account-
able to the Constitution. But this 
President doesn’t believe that, and 
that is why we are here. 
Remember, the precedent that you 
set in this trial will shape American 
democracy for the future. It will gov-
ern this President, and it will govern 
those who follow. If you let the Presi-
dent get away with his obstruction, 
you risk grave and irreparable harm to 
the separation of powers itself. 
Representative Lawrence Hogan, a 
Republican from Maryland, made this 
point during the Nixon impeachment 
hearing. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOGAN (Republican). The historical 
precedent we are setting here is so great be-
cause in every future impeachment of a 
President, it is inconceivable that the evi-
dence relating to that impeachment will not 
be in the hands of the executive branch 
which is under his controls. So I agree with 
the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Seiberling, if 
we do not pass this article today, the whole 
impeachment power becomes meaningless. 
Mr. Manager CROW. This leads us to 
a second consideration: the President’s 
pattern of obstructing. 
Article 
II 
describes 
President 
Trump’s impeachable conduct in ob-
structing Congress. On its own, that 
warrants removal from office. Yet it 
must be noted that the President’s ob-
struction fits a disturbing pattern. 
As stated in article II, President 
Trump’s 
obstruction 
is 
‘‘consistent 
with [his] previous efforts to under-
mine United States Government inves-
tigations into foreign interference in 
United States elections.’’ 
Another 
example 
is 
President 
Trump’s attempts to impede the spe-
cial counsel’s investigation into Rus-
sian interference with the 2016 election, 
as well as the President’s sustained ef-
forts to obstruct the special counsel 
after learning that he was under inves-
tigation for obstruction of justice. 
The special counsel’s investigation 
addressed an issue of extraordinary im-
portance to our national security and 
democracy: the integrity of our elec-
tions themselves. Rather than aid the 
special counsel’s investigation, how-
ever, 
President 
Trump 
sought 
to 
thwart it and used the powers of his of-
fice to do it. 
After learning that he himself was 
under investigation, President Trump 
ordered the firing of the special coun-
sel, sought to curtail the special coun-
sel’s 
investigation, 
instructed 
the 
White House Counsel to create a false 
record and make false public state-
ments, and tampered with at least two 
key witnesses in the investigation. 
The pattern is as unmistakable as it 
is unnerving. 
In one moment, President Trump 
welcomed and invited a foreign nation 
to interfere in an election to his advan-
tage, and the next, he solicited and 
pressured a foreign nation to do so. 
In one moment, President Trump 
used the powers of his office to ob-
struct the special counsel, and the 
next, he used the powers of his office to 
obstruct the House impeachment in-
quiry. 
In one moment, the President stated 
that he remained free to invite foreign 
interference in our elections. In the 
next, he, in fact, invited additional for-
eign interference in our elections. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. By the way, likewise, 
China should start an investigation into the 
Bidens. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Indeed, Presi-
dent Trump placed his fateful July 25 
call to President Zelensky just 1 day 
after the special counsel testified in 
Congress about his findings. 
As Professor Gerhardt testified be-
fore the Judiciary Committee: 
The power to impeach includes the power 
to investigate, but, if the president can 
stymy this House’s impeachment inquiry, he 
can eliminate the impeachment powers as a 
means for holding him and future presidents 
accountable for serious misconduct. If left 
unchecked, the president will likely con-
tinue his pattern of soliciting foreign inter-
ference on his behalf in the next election. 
I must emphasize that President 
Trump’s obstruction persists to this 
day. 
The second Article of Impeachment 
charges a high crime in progress. As a 
result, the President’s wrongdoing did 
not just harm the House as we have 
performed our own constitutional duty; 
it is also harming the Senate, which is 
being deprived of information you need 
before the votes you will soon take. 
And, of course, the true victim is the 
American people, who deserve the full 
truth. 
As we have discussed, the President 
claims that all the evidence he is hid-
ing and covering up would actually 
prove his innocence. To borrow a 
phrase from the late Justice Scalia, 
that claim ‘‘taxes the credulity of the 
credulous.’’ 
President Trump has used all the au-
thority of his office to block the full 
truth from coming to light. He has de-
fied subpoenas and ordered others to do 
so. He has publicly intimidated and 
threatened witnesses. He has attacked 
the House for daring to investigate 
him. And he has lobbed an endless vol-
ley of personal attacks on witnesses 
and meritless complaints about proce-
dure to sow confusion and distract the 
American people. 
The President’s abuses are unfolding 
before our eyes, and they must be 
stopped. 
Before I conclude, I think you all de-
serve an explanation from me as to 
why I am standing here. There has 
been a lot of conversation in the last 
few years about what makes America 
great, and I have some ideas about 
that. I happen to think that what 
makes America great is that genera-
tion after generation, there have been 
Americans who have been willing to 
stand up and put aside their self-inter-
est to make great sacrifices for the 
public good, for our country. I know 
because I have seen people do that. 
Like some of the people in this Cham-
ber, I have seen people give everything 
for this country so we could sit here 
today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S560 
January 24, 2020 
Now, this isn’t politically expedient. 
It certainly isn’t for me. It is hard. It 
requires sacrifice. It is uncomfortable. 
But that is the very definition of ‘‘pub-
lic service’’; that we are here to give of 
ourselves for the country, for others, at 
sacrifice to ourselves. Those who have 
given so much for this country deserve 
nothing less from us now than to try to 
honor those sacrifices. I have tried to 
do that the last few days. My time is 
done, and it is now your turn. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Chief Justice, 
Senators, counsel for the President, 
you will be pleased to know this is the 
last presentation of the evening. And 
as I started last night, I made reference 
to some good advice I got from an en-
couraging voice that said: Keep it up 
but not too long. 
Tonight I got some equally good ad-
vice: To be immortal, you don’t need to 
be eternal. I will do my best not to be 
eternal. 
The first point I would like to make 
is I am tired. I don’t know about you, 
but I am exhausted, and I can only 
imagine how you feel. But I am also 
very deeply grateful for just how you 
have attended to these presentations 
and discussions over the last few days. 
I am deeply grateful. I can tell how 
much consideration you have given to 
our point of view and the President’s 
point of view, and that is all we can 
ask. At the end of the day, all we can 
ask is that you hear us out and make 
the best judgment that you can, con-
sistent with your conscience and our 
Constitution. 
Now, I wanted to start out tonight 
with where we began when we first ap-
peared before you about a week ago, 
and that is with the resolution itself, 
with what the President is charged 
with in the articles and how that holds 
up now that you have heard the evi-
dence from the House. 
Donald Trump was impeached in arti-
cle I for abuse of power, and that arti-
cle provides that: 
In his conduct of the office of the President 
of the United States—and in violation of his 
constitutional oath faithfully to execute the 
office of President of the United States and, 
to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, 
and defend the Constitution of the United 
States, and in violation of his constitutional 
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed—Donald J. Trump has abused the 
powers of the Presidency, in that: 
Using the powers of his high office, Presi-
dent Trump solicited the interference of a 
foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 
United States Presidential election. 
‘‘President Trump solicited inter-
ference 
of 
a 
foreign 
government, 
Ukraine, in the 2020 election.’’ 
That has been proved. 
He did so through a scheme or course of 
conduct that included soliciting the Govern-
ment of Ukraine to publicly announce inves-
tigations that would benefit his reelection, 
harm the election prospects of a political op-
ponent, and influence the 2020 Presidential 
election to his advantage. 
That has been proved. 
President Trump also sought to pressure 
the Government of Ukraine to take these 
steps by conditioning official United States 
Government acts of significant value to 
Ukraine on its public announcement of the 
investigations. 
That has been proved. 
President Trump engaged in this scheme or 
course of conduct for corrupt purposes in 
pursuit of personal political benefit. 
That has been proved. 
In so doing, President Trump used the pow-
ers of the Presidency in a manner that com-
promised the national security of the United 
States and undermined the integrity of the 
United States democratic process. 
That has been proved. 
He thus ignored and injured the interests 
of the Nation. 
That has been proved. 
President Trump engaged in this scheme or 
course of conduct through the following 
means: 
(1) President Trump—acting both directly 
and through his agents within and outside 
the United States Government—corruptly 
solicited the Government of Ukraine to pub-
licly announce investigations into— 
(A) a political opponent, former Vice Presi-
dent Joseph R. Biden, Jr.; and 
That has been proved. 
(B) a discredited theory promoted by Rus-
sia alleging that Ukraine—rather than Rus-
sia—interfered in the 2016 United States 
Presidential election. 
That has been proved. 
(2) With the same corrupt motives, Presi-
dent 
Trump—acting 
both 
directly 
and 
through his agents within and outside the 
United States Government—conditioned two 
official acts on the public announcements 
that he had requested— 
(A) the release of $391 million of United 
States taxpayer funds that Congress had ap-
propriated on a bipartisan basis for the pur-
pose of providing vital military and security 
assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian ag-
gression and which President Trump had or-
dered suspended. 
That has been proved. 
(B) a head of state meeting at the White 
House, which the President of Ukraine 
sought to demonstrate continued United 
States 
support 
for 
the 
Government 
of 
Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. 
That has been proved. 
(3) Faced with the public revelation of his 
actions, President Trump ultimately re-
leased the military and security assistance 
to the Government of Ukraine, but has per-
sisted in openly and corruptly urging and so-
liciting Ukraine to undertake investigations 
for his personal political benefit. 
That has been proved. 
These actions were consistent with Presi-
dent Trump’s previous invitations of foreign 
interference in United States elections. 
That has been proved. 
In all of this, President Trump abused the 
powers of the Presidency by ignoring and in-
juring national security and other vital na-
tional interests to obtain an improper per-
sonal political benefit. 
That has been proved. 
He also betrayed the Nation by abusing his 
high office to enlist a foreign power in cor-
rupting democratic elections. 
That has been proved. 
Wherefore President Trump, by such con-
duct, has demonstrated that he will remain a 
threat to national security and the Constitu-
tion if allowed to remain in office, and has 
acted in a manner grossly incompatible with 
self-governance and the rule of law. 
That has been proved. 
President Trump thus warrants impeach-
ment and trial, removal from office, and dis-
qualification to hold and enjoy any office of 
honor, trust, or profit under the United 
States. 
That will be for you to decide. But 
the facts have been proved. Those facts 
are not contested. We have met our 
burden. 
Article II: Obstruction of Congress. 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and the President 
‘‘shall be removed from Office on Impeach-
ment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Brib-
ery, 
or 
other 
high 
Crimes 
and 
Mis-
demeanors.’’ In his conduct of the office of 
President of the United States—and in viola-
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to 
execute the office of President of the United 
States and, to the best of his ability, pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the 
laws 
be 
faithfully 
executed—Donald 
J. 
Trump has directed the unprecedented, cat-
egorical, and indiscriminate defiance of sub-
poenas issued by the House of Representa-
tives pursuant to its ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment’’. 
That has been proved. 
President Trump has abused the powers of 
Presidency in a manner offensive to, and 
subversive of, the Constitution, in that: 
The House of Representatives has engaged 
in an impeachment inquiry focused on Presi-
dent Trump’s corrupt solicitation of the 
Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 
2020 United States Presidential election. 
That has been proved. 
As part of this impeachment inquiry, the 
Committees 
undertaking 
investigation 
served subpoenas seeking documents and tes-
timony deemed vital to the inquiry for var-
ious Executive Branch agencies and offices, 
and current and former officials. 
That has been proved. 
In response, without lawful cause or ex-
cuse, President Trump directed Executive 
Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to 
comply with those subpoenas. 
That has been proved. 
President Trump thus interposed the pow-
ers of the Presidency against the lawful sub-
poenas of the House of Representatives, and 
assumed to himself functions and judgments 
necessary to the exercise of the ‘‘sole Power 
of Impeachment’’ vested by the Constitution 
in the House of Representatives. 
That has been proved. 
President Trump abused the powers of his 
high office through the following means: 
(1) Directing the White House to defy a 
lawful subpoena by withholding the produc-
tion of documents sought therein by the 
Committees. 
That has been proved. 
(2) Directing other Executive Branch agen-
cies and offices to defy lawful subpoenas and 
withhold the production of documents and 
records from the Committees—in response to 
which the Department of State, Office of 
Management and Budget, Department of En-
ergy, and Department of Defense refused to 
produce a single document or record. 
That has been proved. 
(3) Directing current and former Executive 
Branch officials not to cooperate with the

Committees—in response to which nine Ad-
ministration officials defied subpoenas for 
testimony, namely John Michael ‘‘Mick’’ 
Mulvaney, 
Robert 
B. 
Blair, 
John 
A. 
Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, Preston Wells Grif-
fith, Russell T. Vought, Michael Duffey, 
Brian McCormack, and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl. 
That has been proved. 
These actions were consistent with Presi-
dent Trump’s previous efforts to undermine 
United States Government investigations 
into foreign interference in United States 
elections. 
That has been proved. 
Through these actions, President Trump 
sought to arrogate to himself the right to de-
termine the propriety, scope, and nature of 
an impeachment inquiry into his own con-
duct, as well as the unilateral prerogative to 
deny any and all information to the House of 
Representatives in the exercise of its ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment.’’ 
That has been proved. 
In the history of the Republic, no Presi-
dent has ever ordered the complete defiance 
of an impeachment inquiry or sought to ob-
struct and impede so comprehensively the 
ability of the House of Representatives to in-
vestigate ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. 
That has been proved. 
This abuse of office served to cover up the 
President’s own repeated misconduct and to 
seize and control the power of impeach-
ment—and thus to nullify a vital constitu-
tional safeguard vested solely in the House 
of Representatives. 
This has been proved. 
In all of this, President Trump has acted in 
a manner contrary to his trust as President 
and subversive of constitutional government, 
to the great prejudice of the cause of law and 
justice, and to the manifest injury of the 
people of the United States. 
That has been proved. 
Wherefore, President Trump, by such con-
duct, has demonstrated that he will remain a 
threat to the Constitution if allowed to re-
main in office, and has acted in a manner 
grossly incompatible with self-government 
and the rule of law. 
That has been proved. 
President Trump thus warrants impeach-
ment and trial, removal from office, and dis-
qualification to hold and enjoy any office of 
honor, trust, or profit under the United 
States. 
That will be for you to determine. 
Let me say something about this sec-
ond article. The facts of the President’s 
defiance of Congress are very simple 
because they were so uniform, because 
they were so categorical, because they 
are so uncontested; yet do not mistake 
for a moment the fact that it was sim-
ple and quick to present that course of 
conduct compared with the sophisti-
cated campaign to coerce Ukraine into 
thinking that that second article is 
any less significant than the first. Do 
not believe that for a moment. If there 
is no article II, let me tell you some-
thing: There will never be an article I. 
If there is no article II, there will never 
of any kind or shape or form be an arti-
cle I. 
And why is that? Because, if you and 
we lack the power to investigate a 
President, there will never be an arti-
cle I. Whether that article I is an abuse 
of power or that article I is treason or 
that article I is bribery, there will 
never be an article I if the Congress 
can’t investigate an impeachable of-
fense. If the Congress cannot inves-
tigate the President’s own wrongdoing 
because the President prevents it, 
there will never be an article I because 
there will be no more impeachment 
power. It will be gone. It will be gone. 
As I said before, our relationship 
with Ukraine will survive. God willing, 
our relationship with Ukraine will sur-
vive, and Ukraine will prosper. We will 
get beyond this ugly chapter of our his-
tory. 
Yet, if we are to decide here that a 
President of the United States can sim-
ply say, Under article II, I can do what-
ever I want, and I don’t have to treat a 
coequal branch of government like it 
exists, and I don’t have to give it any 
more than the back of my hand, that 
will be an unending injury to this 
country—Ukraine will survive, and so 
will we—but that will be an unending 
injury to this country because the bal-
ance of power that our Founders set 
out will never be the same if a Presi-
dent can simply say: I am going to 
fight all subpoenas. 
I will tell you something else. Truism 
in the courts is just as true here in the 
Senate. When they say, ‘‘Justice de-
layed is justice denied,’’ if you give 
this President or any other the unilat-
eral power to delay as long as he or she 
likes—to litigate matters for years and 
years in the courts—do not fool your-
self into thinking it is anything less. 
In April, it will be a year since we 
subpoenaed Don McGahn, and there is 
no sign of an end to that case. I will 
tell you, when it gets to the Supreme 
Court, you might think that is the end, 
but it is just the end of the first chap-
ter because Don McGahn is in court, 
saying: I am absolutely immune from 
testifying. 
Now, that has been rejected by every 
court that has looked at it. We will see 
what the court of appeals says, and 
then we will see if it goes to an en banc 
court of appeals, and then we will see 
what the Supreme Court says. When we 
prevail in the Supreme Court, do you 
know what happens? That is not the 
end of the matter. It goes back to the 
trial court, and then—well, they can’t 
claim absolute immunity anymore. 
They can’t claim that. They don’t even 
have to bother showing up. 
So now we are going to turn to plan 
B, executive privilege, where ‘‘we can’t 
and won’t answer any of the questions 
that are really pertinent to your im-
peachment inquiry.’’ Let’s start out in 
district court and then go to the court 
of appeals and then go to the en banc 
and then go to the Supreme Court. 
You can game the system for years. 
Justice delayed is justice denied, and 
so it is true about Presidential ac-
countability. When you suggest or I 
suggest or anyone suggests or the 
White House suggests ‘‘why didn’t the 
Congress—why didn’t the House—just 
exhaust their remedies?’’—as if in the 
Constitution, where it says ‘‘the House 
shall have the sole Power of Impeach-
ment’’ there is an asterisk that reads: 
‘‘after exhausting all court remedies 
and seeking relief in the district court 
and seeking relief in the court of ap-
peals and, after that, going to the Su-
preme Court’’—let’s not kid ourselves 
about what that really is. 
What that really means is you allow 
the President to control the timing of 
his own impeachment or if it will ever 
be permitted to come before this body. 
That is not an impeachment power. 
That is the absence of an impeachment 
power. 
Article II is every bit as important as 
article I. Without article II, there is no 
article I ever again, no matter how 
egregious this President’s conduct or 
any other’s. It is fundamental to the 
separation of powers. If you can’t have 
the ability to enforce an impeachment 
power, you might as well not put it in 
the Constitution. 
Shortly, the President’s lawyers will 
have a chance to make their presen-
tation. As we will not have the ability 
to respond to what they say, I want to 
give you a little preview of what I 
think they are going to have in store 
for you so that, when you do hear it, 
you can put it into some perspective. 
I expect that they will attack the 
process, and I don’t think that is any 
mystery. I want to tell you both what 
I expect they will share with you and 
what it really means. When you cut 
through all of the chaff, what does it 
really mean that they are saying? This 
is what I expect they will tell you. 
The process was so unfair. It was the 
most unfair in the history of the world 
because, in the House, they took depo-
sitions. How dare they take deposi-
tions? How dare they listen to Trey 
Gowdy? How dare they follow the Re-
publican 
procedures 
that 
preceded 
their investigation? How dare they? 
They were so secretive in the bunker 
in the basement, as if whether it is on 
the ground floor or in the basement or 
on the first floor makes any difference. 
There were those supersecret deposi-
tions in which only 100 Members of 
Congress—equivalent to the entire Sen-
ate—could participate. That is how se-
cret they were. That is how exclusive 
they were. Every Democrat, every Re-
publican on the three committees 
could 
participate. 
Of 
course, 
that 
wasn’t enough, so you even had more 
storm the SCIF, right? So you have 100 
people who can participate, but as you 
heard earlier, the Republicans were not 
allowed to participate. 
OK. That is just false. Do you know 
how we did it in those supersecret 
depositions? You can look this up your-
selves because we released the tran-
scripts. We got an hour. They got an 
hour. We got 45 minutes. They got 45 
minutes. We did that back and forth 
until everyone was done asking their 
questions. 
You are going to hear that Chairman 
SCHIFF was so unfair, he wouldn’t allow 
us to ask our questions. Well, there 
were certain questions I didn’t allow,

questions like ‘‘Who is the whistle-
blower? because we want to punish that 
whistleblower.’’ Some of us in that 
House and in this House believe we 
ought to protect whistleblowers. So, 
yes, I did not allow the outing of the 
whistleblower. 
When 
they 
say 
the 
chairman 
wouldn’t allow certain questions, that 
is what they mean. It means that we 
protect people who have the courage to 
come forward and blow the whistle, and 
we don’t think—though the President 
might—that they are traitors and 
spies. To believe that someone who 
blows the whistle on misconduct of the 
serious nature that you now know took 
place is a traitor or a spy, there is only 
one way you can come to that conclu-
sion, and that is if you believe you are 
the state and that anything that con-
tradicts you is treason. That is the 
only way that you could conceive of 
someone who exposes wrongdoing as 
being a traitor or a spy, but that is ex-
actly how this President views those 
who expose his wrongdoing—because he 
is the state. Like any good monarch, 
he is the state. 
You will hear the President wasn’t 
allowed to participate in the Judiciary 
Committee. Well, that is false, too, as 
you know. The President had the same 
rights in our proceedings as President 
Nixon and President Clinton. Nonethe-
less, you will hear it was so unfair. 
One other thing that was really un-
fair was that all of the subpoenas were 
invalid because the House didn’t pass a 
resolution announcing its impeach-
ment inquiry—never mind that we ac-
tually did. The problem was, they said, 
well, we had not, and then we did. Then 
the problem was, well, you did. 
Of course, as you know, the Constitu-
tion says the House will ‘‘have the sole 
Power of Impeachment.’’ If we want to 
do it by House resolution, we can do it 
by House resolution. If we want to do it 
by committee, we can do it by com-
mittee. It is not the President’s place 
to tell us how to conduct an impeach-
ment proceeding any more than it is 
the President’s place to tell you how 
you should try it. 
So, when you see that eight-page dia-
tribe from the White House Counsel, 
saying we should have been able to 
have had a resolution in the House or 
we should have been able to have had 
‘‘this,’’ what you should hear—what 
they really mean—is Donald Trump 
had the right to control his own im-
peachment proceeding, and it is an out-
rage that Donald Trump didn’t get to 
write the rules of his own impeachment 
proceeding in the House. If you give a 
President that right, there is no im-
peachment power. You will hear them 
say that. 
You will hear them complain about 
depositions that were the same as the 
Republicans’ or the right to participate 
that was the same as with Clinton and 
Nixon and that, by the way, they were 
not allowed to call witnesses, they 
said. Well, 3 of the 12 witnesses that we 
heard in our open hearings were the 
minority’s witness requests. You will 
hear those arguments, that it was the 
most unfair in history. The fact is we 
have the same process. 
In those other impeachments, the 
majority did not surrender its sub-
poena power to the minority. Do you 
know what it did? It said you can sub-
poena witnesses, and if the majority 
doesn’t agree, you can force a vote. 
That is the same process we have here. 
The majority does not surrender its 
subpoena power. It didn’t in the prior 
impeachments, and it didn’t in this 
one. When they say the process was un-
fair, what they really mean is, Don’t 
look at what the President did. For 
God’s sake, don’t look at what the 
President did. 
I think the second thing you will 
hear from the President’s team will be 
to attack the managers. Those man-
agers are just awful. They are terrible 
people, especially that Schiff guy. He is 
the worst. He is the worst. In exhibit A, 
he mocked the President. He mocked 
the President. He mocked the Presi-
dent as if he was shaking down the 
leader of another country like he was 
an organized crime figure. He mocked 
the President. He said it was like the 
President said: Listen, Zelensky, be-
cause I am only going to say this seven 
times. 
Well, I discovered something very 
significant by mocking the President, 
and that is, for a man who loves to 
mock others, he does not like to be 
mocked. As it turns out, he has got 
pretty thin skin. Who would have 
thought? Never mind that I said I 
wasn’t using his words before I said it 
and that I wasn’t using his words after 
I said it and that I said I was making 
a parody of his words. It is an outrage, 
he mocked the President—that SCHIFF, 
terrible. 
They will attack other colleagues, 
too, for things said in the heat of de-
bate here on the floor as we were 
reaching the wee hours in the morning, 
and they will attack some of my col-
leagues who aren’t even in this Cham-
ber. Maybe they will attack The Squad. 
That is a perennial favorite with the 
President. If they attack The Squad, 
you should ask: What does that have to 
do with the price of beans? 
You can expect attacks on all kinds 
of Members of the House that have 
nothing to do with the issues before 
you. When you hear those attacks, you 
should ask yourself: Away from what 
do they want to distract my attention? 
Nine times out of ten, it will be the 
President’s misconduct. Look for it— 
attacks on the managers, attacks on 
other House Members, attacks on the 
Speaker, attacks on who knows what. 
It is all of the same ilk. Whatever you 
do, just don’t consider the President’s 
misconduct. 
You will also hear attacks on the 
Constitution. Of course, it will not be 
framed as attacking the Constitution, 
but that is really what it represents, 
and that is: Abuse of power doesn’t vio-
late the Constitution. 
Presidents of the United States have 
every right to abuse their power. That 
is the argument. 
OK. I know it is a hard argument to 
make, right? Presidents have a con-
stitutional right to abuse their power, 
and how dare the House of Representa-
tives charge a President with abusing 
his power? 
Now, I am looking forward to that 
constitutional 
argument 
by 
Alan 
Dershowitz because I want to know 
why abusing power and trust is not im-
peachable now, but it was a few years 
ago. The last time I checked, I don’t 
think there was significant change to 
the Constitution between the time he 
said it was impeachable and the time 
he is saying now that, apparently, it is 
not impeachable. So I am looking for-
ward to that argument. 
But I am also looking forward to Ken 
Starr’s presentation because, during 
the Clinton impeachment, he main-
tained that a President not only could 
but must be impeached for obstructing 
justice, that Clinton—Bill Clinton— 
needed to be impeached because he lied 
under oath about sex, and to do so ob-
structed justice. 
You can be impeached for obstruct-
ing justice, but you cannot be im-
peached for obstructing Congress. 
Now, I have to confess I don’t know 
exactly how that is supposed to work 
because the logical conclusion from 
that is Ken Starr is saying that Bill 
Clinton’s mistake was in showing up 
under subpoena, that Bill Clinton’s 
mistake was in not saying: I am going 
to fight all subpoenas. Bill Clinton’s 
mistake was in not taking the position 
that under article II he could do what-
ever he wanted. 
Does that really make any sense? 
You can be impeached for obstructing 
your own branch of government, but 
you cannot be impeached for obstruct-
ing a coequal branch of government. 
That would make no sense to the 
Framers. I have to think, over the cen-
turies, as they have watched us, they 
would be astonished that anyone would 
take that argument seriously or could 
so misapprehend how this balance of 
power is supposed to work. 
So I look forward to that argument, 
and maybe, when they make that argu-
ment, they can explain to us why their 
position on abuse of power isn’t even 
supported by their own Attorney Gen-
eral. So I hope they will answer why 
even 
their 
own 
Attorney 
General 
doesn’t agree with them—not to men-
tion, by the way, the constitutional 
law expert called by the Republicans in 
the House who also testified, as to 
abuse of power, that it is impeachable, 
that you don’t need a crime. It is im-
peachable. 
When you hear them make these ar-
guments—cannot 
be 
impeached 
for 
abusing your power—this is what it 
really means: We cannot defend his 
conduct, so we want to make it go all 
away without even having to think 
about it. You don’t even need to think 
about what the President did because

the House charged it wrong, so don’t 
even consider what the President did. 
That is what that argument means. We 
can’t defend the indefensible, so we 
have to fall back on this: Even if he 
abused his office, even if he did all the 
things he is accused of, that is per-
fectly fine. Nothing can be done about 
it. 
You will also hear, as part of the de-
fense—and you heard this from Jay 
Sekulow. I think it was the last thing 
he said: ‘‘The whistleblower.’’ And then 
he stepped back to the table. ‘‘The 
whistleblower.’’ 
I don’t really know what that means, 
but I suspect you will hear more of 
that. ‘‘The whistleblower.’’ ‘‘The whis-
tleblower.’’ It is his or her fault that 
we are here. ‘‘The whistleblower.’’ 
You know, I would encourage you to 
read 
the 
whistleblower 
complaint 
again. When you read that complaint 
again, you will see just how remark-
ably accurate it is. It is astonishingly 
accurate. 
You know, for all the times the 
President is out there saying that the 
complaint was all wrong, was all 
wrong, you read it—now that you have 
heard the evidence, you read it, and 
you will see how remarkably right the 
whistleblower is. 
When that complaint was filed, it 
was obviously before we had our depo-
sitions and had our hearings, all of 
which obviated the need for the whis-
tleblower. 
In the beginning, we wanted the 
whistleblower to come and testify be-
cause all that we knew about was the 
complaint, but then we were able to 
hear from firsthand witnesses about 
what happened. 
Then something else happened. The 
President and his allies began threat-
ening the whistleblower, and the life of 
the whistleblower was at risk. And 
what was the point in exposing that 
whistleblower at the risk of his or her 
life when we had the evidence we need-
ed? What was the point, except retribu-
tion? Retribution—and the President 
wants it still. 
Do you know why the President is 
mad at the whistleblower? Because, but 
for the whistleblower, he wouldn’t have 
been 
caught, 
and 
that 
is 
an 
unforgiveable sin. He is the State, and 
but for the whistleblower, the Presi-
dent wouldn’t have been caught. For 
that he is a spy, and he is guilty of 
treason. 
Now, what does he add to this? Noth-
ing but retribution—a pound of flesh. 
You will also hear the President’s de-
fense: They hate the President. They 
hate the President. You should not 
consider the President’s misconduct 
because they hate the President. 
Now, what I have said—I will leave 
you to your own judgments about the 
President. I only hate what he has done 
to this country. I grieve for what he 
has done to this country. 
But when they make the argument to 
you that this is only happening be-
cause they hate the President, it is just 
another of the myriad forms of ‘‘Please 
do not consider what the President 
did.’’ 
Whether you like the President or 
you dislike the President is immate-
rial. It is all about the Constitution 
and his misconduct. If it meets the 
standard of impeachable conduct, as we 
have proved, it doesn’t matter whether 
you like him; it doesn’t matter wheth-
er you dislike him. What matters is 
whether he is a danger to the country 
because he will do it again, and none of 
us can have confidence, based on his 
record, that he will not do it again be-
cause he is telling us every day that he 
will. 
You will hear the further defense 
that Biden is corrupt—that Joe Biden 
is corrupt, that Hunter Biden is cor-
rupt. This is their defense. It is another 
defense because what they hope to 
achieve in a Senate trial is what they 
couldn’t achieve through their scheme. 
If they couldn’t get Ukraine to smear 
the Bidens, they want to use this trial 
to do it instead. So let’s call Hunter 
Biden. Let’s smear the Bidens. Let’s 
succeed in the trial with what we 
couldn’t do with this scheme. That is 
the goal. 
Now, I don’t know whether Rudy 
Giuliani, who said he was going to 
present his report to some of the Sen-
ators, has presented his report. Maybe 
he has. Maybe you will get to see what 
is in Rudy Giuliani’s report. Maybe you 
will get to see some documents smear-
ing 
the 
Bidens 
produced 
by—who 
knows? Maybe these same Russian, 
corrupt former prosecutors. 
But make no mistake about what 
that is about. It is about completing 
the object of the scheme through other 
means, through the means of this trial. 
You may hear the argument that 
what the President is doing when he is 
obstructing Congress is protecting the 
office for future Presidents because 
there is nothing more important to 
Donald Trump than protecting the Of-
fice of the Presidency for future Presi-
dents. And I suppose when he withheld 
military aid from Ukraine, he was try-
ing to protect future Presidents. And 
when he sought to force a foreign 
power to intervene in our election, he 
was doing it on behalf of future Presi-
dents because future Presidents might 
likewise wish to cheat in a further 
election. 
I don’t think that argument goes 
very far, but I expect you will hear it. 
I expect you will hear it. 
You may hear an argument that the 
President was really concerned about 
corruption, 
and 
he 
was 
concerned 
about 
the 
burden-sharing. 
I 
won’t 
spend much time on that because you 
have heard the evidence on that. There 
is no indication that this had anything 
to do with corruption and every, every 
bit of evidence that it had nothing to 
do with fighting corruption or burden- 
sharing. Indeed, nothing about the bur-
den changed between the time he froze 
the aid and the time he released the 
aid. There was no new effort to get oth-
ers to contribute more, and Europe 
contributes a great deal as it is. This is 
an after-the-fact rationalization. 
You probably saw the public report-
ing that there was an exhaustive effort 
after the fact to come up with a post 
hoc rationalization for this scheme. I 
would like to show you the product of 
that investigation, but I will need your 
help because it is among the docu-
ments they refuse to turn over. They 
will show you just what an after-the- 
fact invention this argument is. 
Now, I expect you will hear the argu-
ment that Obama did it. Obama did it. 
That may take several different forms, 
but the form of ‘‘Obama did it’’ that I 
am referring to is ‘‘Obama also with-
held aid.’’ Honestly, I think that argu-
ment is an insult to our intelligence 
because the argument is that Obama 
withheld aid from Egypt, and he made 
a condition with it. 
Obama withheld aid from Egypt after 
they 
had 
a 
revolution 
and 
cir-
cumstances changed. And do you know 
something? He didn’t hide it from Con-
gress. In fact, Congress supported it. 
Yes, there are times when we withhold 
aid for a good policy reason—not a cor-
rupt effort to get help in your election. 
The American people know the dif-
ference between right and wrong. They 
can recognize the difference between 
aid that is withheld for a malicious 
purpose and aid that is held in the best 
interests of our national security. But 
you will hear the ‘‘Obama did it’’ argu-
ment. 
You will hear the call was perfect. 
You will hear the call was perfect. I 
suspect the reason they will make the 
argument that the call was perfect is 
because the President insists that they 
do. I don’t think they really want to 
have to make that argument. You 
wouldn’t either. But they have a client 
to represent, so they will make the ar-
gument that the call was perfect, and 
they will also make the argument that 
Ukraine thinks the call was perfect. 
Ukraine says there was no pressure. 
What that really means is that 
Ukraine wants a future. Ukraine knows 
it is still beholden to us for aid. 
Ukraine still hasn’t gotten in through 
the door of the White House. Ukraine 
knows if they acknowledged that they 
were shaken down by the President of 
the United States, the President of the 
United States will make them pay. So 
when you hear them say that Ukraine 
felt no pressure and their proof is be-
cause the Ukraine President doesn’t 
want to call the President of the 
United States a bad name, you will 
know why—because they need Amer-
ica. They need America. The Framers 
did not expect you to leave your com-
mon sense at the door. 
Now, you will also hear the defense 
that the President said there was ‘‘no 
quid pro quo.’’ The President said there 
was ‘‘no quid pro quo.’’ I guess that is 
the end of the story. This is a well- 
known principle of criminal law—that 
if the defendant says he didn’t do it, he 
couldn’t have done it.

If the defendant learns he has been 
caught and he says that he didn’t do it, 
he couldn’t have done it. That doesn’t 
hold up in any courtroom. It shouldn’t 
hold up here. 
You also will hear a variation of ‘‘no 
harm no foul.’’ They got the money. 
They got the money, and they got the 
meeting—even 
though 
they 
didn’t. 
They got the meeting on the sideline of 
the U.N.—kind of a drive-by. But they 
got a meeting—no harm no foul, right? 
The meeting on the sidelines is pretty 
much the same thing, right, as a head- 
of-state meeting in the Oval Office? Of 
course, it is not. 
Why do you think, at the meeting at 
the United Nations, the President of 
Ukraine was still saying: Hey, when am 
I going to get to come to town? He cer-
tainly recognizes the difference, and we 
should too. What is more, there is 
every bit of harm and every bit of foul 
in withholding aid from an ally at war 
and releasing it only when you are 
caught. 
Russia knows now about the wedge in 
our relations with Ukraine. The mo-
ment Russia found out about this—and 
I have to imagine, given how good their 
intel services are, they did not have to 
wait for POLITICO to break the story 
any more than Ukraine. In fact, there 
is so deep a penetration of Ukraine, I 
would have to expect that the Russians 
would have found out at least as early 
as the Ukrainians did, if not earlier. 
The moment Ukraine learned and 
Russia learned, there was harm, be-
cause Ukraine knew they couldn’t 
trust us and Russia knew they could 
take advantage of us. There was imme-
diate harm, and just because someone 
is caught, because a scheme is thwart-
ed, doesn’t make that scheme any less 
criminal and corrupt. You get no pass 
when you get caught. 
I expect one of the defenses you will 
see is they will play you certain testi-
mony from the House where my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
ask questions like these: Did the Presi-
dent ever say he was bribing Ukraine? 
Did you ever see him actually bribe 
Ukraine? Did you hear him say that he 
was going to bribe Ukraine? Did you 
personally see this yourself? If you 
didn’t see it, if he didn’t lay it out for 
you, then it could not have happened. 
Two plus two does not equal four. You 
are not allowed to consider anything 
except for a televised confession by the 
President, and, even then, don’t con-
sider it. 
So I imagine you will hear some of 
that testimony where witnesses are 
asked—they work for the Defense De-
partment: Did the President ever tell 
you that he was conditioning the aid? 
Never mind that these are people who 
don’t necessarily even talk to the 
President, but I expect you will see 
some of that. 
As I mentioned before, you will hear 
the defense say: We claim privilege. 
You can’t impeach the President over 
the exercise of privilege. Never mind 
the fact that they never claimed privi-
lege; they never asserted privilege. And 
do you know why? Do you know why 
they never actually invoked privilege 
in the House? It is because they know 
that if they did, they would have to 
produce the documents and they would 
have to show what they were redact-
ing, and they didn’t want to do even 
that. They knew for the overwhelming 
majority of the documents and witness 
testimony there was no even colorable 
claim of privilege. So they didn’t even 
want to invoke it. All they were saying 
is ‘‘Maybe someday.’’ But you will hear 
that you can’t be impeached for a 
claim of privilege they never made. 
So what do all these defenses mean? 
What do they mean? What do they 
mean collectively when you add them 
all up? 
What they mean is, under article II, 
the President can do whatever he 
wants. That is really it. That is really 
it, stripped of all the detail and all the 
histrionics. What they want us to be-
lieve is that the President can do what-
ever he wants under article II, and 
there is nothing that you or the House 
can do about it. 
Robert Kennedy once said: 
Moral courage is a rarer commodity than 
bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it 
is the one essential, vital quality for those 
who seek to change a world that yields most 
painfully to change. 
‘‘Moral courage is a rarer commodity 
than bravery in battle.’’ I have to say, 
when I first read that, I wasn’t sure I 
agreed. Moral courage is a rarer qual-
ity than courage in battle. It just 
doesn’t seem right. I wasn’t sure I real-
ly agreed, and for a Democrat not to 
agree with a Kennedy is kind of a her-
esy. I am sure my GOP colleagues feel 
the same way about the Kennedys from 
Louisiana. After all, what can be more 
brave than courage in battle? What 
could be more rare than courage in bat-
tle? But then I got to visit, as I know 
all of you have, our servicemembers 
around the world and see just how 
blessed we are with an abundance of 
heroes by the millions who have joined 
the service of this country—service-
members who, every day, demonstrate 
the most incredible bravery. I just have 
the greatest respect for them, for peo-
ple like JASON CROW and John McCain 
and Daniel Inouye and so many others 
who served in this body or the other or 
who never served in office, by the mil-
lions, around the country and around 
the world—the most incredible respect. 
It is an amazing thing, how common is 
their uncommon bravery. 
My father is 92. He is probably watch-
ing. He is part of the ‘‘greatest genera-
tion.’’ He left high school early to join 
the service. He tried to enlist in the 
Marine Corps, and he failed the phys-
ical. At the end of World War II, he 
failed the physical for bad eyesight and 
flat feet—which was apparently enough 
to fail the physical. So 2 weeks later, 
he went and tried to enlist in the 
Army, thinking: Maybe it is a different 
physical standard, and even if it isn’t, 
maybe I will get a different physician. 
As it turned out—same standard, same 
physician. He recognized my father, 
and he said: Weren’t you here 2 weeks 
ago? 
And my father said: Yeah. 
And he said: Do you really want to 
get in that bad? 
And my father said: Yeah. And he 
was in the Army. 
So the war was over, and he never 
left the United States. When he left the 
service, he went to the University of 
Alabama. About midway through, he 
wanted to get on with his life, and he 
left college and went out into the busi-
ness world. It is something he will al-
ways regret—leaving college early—but 
I think in many ways he got a better 
education than I did. 
I think I was lucky to get a good edu-
cation, but I think those like JASON— 
and others who served in the military 
and also went to school—got the best 
education. But I think there are cer-
tain things you can only learn by being 
in the military. Certainly, you can’t 
really learn about war without going 
to war, and maybe there are things you 
just can’t learn about life without 
going to war. So those of you who have 
served have the most complete edu-
cation I think there is. 
Even so, is moral courage really 
more rare than that on a battlefield? 
And then I saw what Robert Kennedy 
meant by moral courage. He said: ‘‘Few 
men are willing to brave the dis-
approval of their peers, the censure of 
their colleagues, [and] the wrath of 
their society.’’ 
Then I understood by that measure 
just how rare moral courage is. How 
many of us are willing to brave the dis-
approval of our peers, the censure of 
our colleagues, and the wrath of our so-
ciety? 
Just as those who have not served in 
the military can’t fully understand 
what service means, so, too, there is a 
different kind of paternity or sorority 
among those who have served in the 
House. I always tell my constituents 
that there are two kinds of jobs in Con-
gress, and it is not Democrats or Re-
publicans; it is those in a safe seat, and 
those in an unsafe seat. I am sure the 
same is true of those in a safe State or 
an unsafe State. It is why I think there 
is a certain chemistry between Mem-
bers who represent those swing dis-
tricts and States—because they can 
step into each other’s shoes. 
One of the things that we in this fel-
lowship of officeholders understand 
that most people don’t is that real po-
litical courage doesn’t come from dis-
agreeing with our opponents but from 
disagreeing with our friends and with 
our own party because it means having 
to stare down accusations of disloyalty 
and betrayal: He’s a Democrat in name 
only or she’s a Republican in name 
only. 
What I said last night, if it resonated 
with anyone in this Chamber, didn’t re-
quire courage. My views, as heartfelt 
as they are, reflect the views of my 
constituents. But what happens when

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S565 
January 24, 2020 
our heartfelt views of right and wrong 
are in conflict with the popular opinion 
of our constituents? 
What happens when the devotion to 
our oaths, to our values, to our love of 
country depart from the momentary 
passion of the large number of people 
backing us? Those are the times that 
try our souls. 
CBS news reported last night that a 
Trump confidante said that GOP Sen-
ators were warned: ‘‘Vote against the 
President, and your head will be on a 
pike.’’ I don’t know if that is true. 
‘‘Vote against the President, and 
your head will be on a pike.’’ I have to 
say when I read that—and again, I 
don’t know if that is true, but when I 
read that, I was struck by the irony. I 
hope it is not true. I hope it is not true. 
I was struck by the irony of the idea, 
when we are talking about a President 
who would make himself a Monarch, 
that whoever that was would use the 
terminology of a penalty that was op-
posed by a Monarch—‘‘head on a pike.’’ 
Just this week America lost a hero, 
Thomas Railsback, who passed away on 
Monday, the day before this trial 
began. Some of you may have known or 
even served with Congressman Thomas 
Railsback. He was a Republican from 
Illinois and the second ranking Mem-
ber on the House Judiciary Committee 
when that committee was conducting 
its impeachment inquiry into Presi-
dent Nixon. 
In July of 1974, as the inquiry was 
coming to a close, Congressman Rails-
back began meeting with a bipartisan 
group of Members of the House—three 
other Republicans and three Demo-
crats. Here in the Senate they might 
have called them the Gang of 7. 
They gathered and they talked and 
they labored over language and ulti-
mately helped develop the bipartisan 
support for the articles that led a 
group of Republican Senators, includ-
ing 
Barry 
Goldwater 
and 
Howard 
Baker, to tell President Nixon that he 
must resign. 
Some say that the Nixon impeach-
ment might not have moved forward 
were it not for those four courageous 
Republicans led by Congressman Rails-
back, and it pained the Congressman 
because he credited Nixon with giving 
him his seat and with getting him 
elected. He did it, he said, because 
‘‘seeing all the evidence, it was some-
thing we had to do because the evi-
dence was there.’’ One of his aides, Ray 
LaHood, eulogized him saying: He felt 
an obligation to the Constitution to do 
what is right. 
Now, soon, Members of this body will 
face the most momentous of deci-
sions—not, as I said at the outset, be-
tween guilt and innocence, but a far 
more foundational issue: Should there 
be a fair trial? Shall the House be able 
to present its case with witnesses and 
documents through the use of sub-
poenas as has been the case in every 
impeachment trial in history? 
Now, the President’s lawyers have 
been making their case outside of this 
Chamber, threatening to stall these 
proceedings with the assertion of false 
claims of privilege. Having persuaded 
this body to postpone consideration of 
the witnesses and documents, they now 
appear to be preparing the ground to 
say it will be too late to consider them 
next week. 
But consider this: Of the hundreds of 
documents that we have subpoenaed, 
there is no colorable claim and none 
has been asserted. To the degree that 
you could even make a claim, that 
claim has been waived. To the degree 
that even superficially the claim would 
attach, it does not conceal misconduct. 
And what is more, to the degree that 
there were a dispute over whether a 
privilege applied, we have a perfectly 
good judge sitting behind me empow-
ered by the rules of this body to resolve 
those disputes. 
When the Chief Justice decides where 
a narrow application of privilege ought 
to apply, you will still have the power 
to overrule him. How often do you get 
the chance to overrule a Chief Justice 
of the Supreme Court? You have to 
admit, it is every legislator’s dream. 
So let us not be fooled by the argu-
ment that it will take too long or per-
suaded that the trial must be over be-
fore the State of the Union. This is no 
parking ticket we are contesting and 
no shoplifting case we are prosecuting. 
It is a matter of high crimes and mis-
demeanors. 
How long is too long to have a fair 
trial—fair to the President and fair to 
the American people? The American 
people do not agree on much, but they 
will not forgive being deprived of the 
truth and certainly not because it took 
a back seat to expediency. 
In his pamphlet of 1777, ‘‘The Amer-
ican Crisis,’’ Thomas Paine wrote: 
Those who expect to reap the blessings of 
freedom must . . . undergo the fatigue of 
supporting it. 
Is it too much fatigue to call wit-
nesses and have a fair trial? Are the 
blessings of freedom so meager that we 
will not endure the fatigue of a real 
trial with witnesses and documents? 
President Lincoln, in his closing mes-
sage to Congress in December 1862, said 
this: 
Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. 
We of this Congress and this administration 
will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No 
personal significance, or insignificance, can 
spare one or another of us. The fiery trial 
through which we pass, will light us down, in 
honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. 
I think he was the most interesting 
President in history. He may be the 
most interesting person in our history. 
This man, who started out dirt poor— 
dirt poor. Like hundreds of thousands 
of other people at the time, he had 
nothing—no money and no education. 
He educated himself. He educated him-
self. But he had a brain in that head, a 
brilliance in that mind that made him 
one of the most incredible, not just 
Presidents, but people in history. 
I think he is the most interesting 
character in our history. Out of the 
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of 
other Americans at the time, why him? 
Why him? 
I think a lot about history, as I know 
you do. Sometimes I think about how 
unforgiving history can be of our con-
duct. 
We can do a lifetime’s work, draft the 
most wonderful legislation, help our 
constituents, and yet we may be re-
membered for none of that. But for a 
single decision, we may be remem-
bered, affecting the course of our coun-
try. 
I believe this may be one of those 
moments—a moment we never thought 
we would see, a moment when our de-
mocracy was gravely threatened and 
not from without but from within. 
Russia, too, has a constitution. It is 
not a bad constitution. It is just a 
meaningless one. In Russia, they have 
trial by telephone. They have the same 
ostensible rights we do to a trial. They 
hear evidence and witnesses, but before 
the verdict is rendered, the judge picks 
up the telephone and calls the right 
person to find out how it is supposed to 
turn out. Trial by telephone. Is that 
what we have here—a trial by tele-
phone, someone on the other end of the 
phone dictating what this trial should 
look like? 
The Founders gave us more than 
words. They gave us inspiration. They 
may have receded into mythology, but 
they inspire us still. And more than us, 
they inspire the rest of the world. They 
inspire the rest of the world. 
From their prison cells in Turkey, 
journalists look to us. From their in-
ternment camps in China, they look to 
us. From their cells in Egypt, those 
who gathered in Tahrir Square for a 
better life look to us. From the Phil-
ippines, those who were the victims 
and their families of mass extrajudicial 
killings, they look to us. From Elgin 
prison, they look to us. From all over 
the world, they look to us. 
Increasingly, they don’t recognize 
what they see. It is a terrible tragedy 
for them. It is a worse tragedy for us, 
because there is nowhere else for them 
to turn. They are not going to turn to 
Russia. They are not going to turn to 
China. They are not going to turn to 
Europe with all of its problems. They 
look to us because we are still the in-
dispensable Nation. They look to us be-
cause we have a rule of law. They look 
to us because no one is above that law. 
One of the things that separates us 
from those people in Elgin prison is the 
right to a trial. It is a right to a trial. 
Americans get a fair trial. 
So I am asking you. I implore you. 
Give America a fair trial. Give Amer-
ica a fair trial. She is worth it. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 2398, 
VETERAN HOUSE ACT OF 2020 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 2398, which amends the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 and title 
38, of the United States Code to expand eligi-
bility for the HUD-VASH program. 
The bill directs the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs to submit annual homeless veteran re-
ports to the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs 
of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives. 
This amendment will help to ensure that the 
rate of homelessness among veterans in the 
United States does not increase. 
Currently, 107,000 veterans are homeless 
on any given night, while double this amount 
will experience homelessness at one point in 
their lives. 
The Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment (HUD), is a government agency 
dedicated to fulfilling the need for affordable 
housing in America. 
VASH is a jointly-administered permanent 
supportive housing program for disabled Vet-
erans experiencing homelessness in which VA 
medical Centers provide referrals and case 
management while Public Housing Agencies 
(PHAs) administer the Section 8 housing 
vouchers. 
The VASH program expands access to 
HUD for homeless veterans. 
H.R. 2398 adds the word ‘‘veteran’’ to the 
Housing Act’s authorizing language, thus 
strengthening the Veterans’ Affairs Supportive 
Housing (VASH) program. 
This change will increase the total number 
of permanent government-issued housing ben-
efits to veterans most vulnerable to homeless-
ness. 
The services provided by the programs 
would assist veterans in both attaining and 
sustaining permanent housing. 
Homelessness among the American veteran 
population is far too high in the United States 
and we must be proactive in giving back to 
those who have given so much to us. 
I ask my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle to support H.R. 2398.

RICK TAYLOR 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend the life and leg-
acy of the late Pennsauken, New Jersey resi-
dent, The Honorable Rick Taylor. 
The late Rick Taylor and his family lived in 
Pennsauken, New Jersey, where he served as 
Pennsauken 
Township’s 
Mayor, 
Deputy 
Mayor, and Township Committeeman for 25 
years and served as a longtime educator at 
Pennsauken Public schools. 
Rick Taylor earned his master’s degree in 
education administration from Glassboro State 
College and moved to Pennsauken in 1969. 
His lengthy career in the township’s schools 
began when he was hired as a Pennsauken 
High School English teacher and held that po-
sition for eight years before advancing to the 
role of assistant principal, which he held for a 
decade. Rick then became principal of two 
Pennsauken elementary schools for nine 
years. He also served as an assistant football 
coach and head golf coach at Pennsauken 
High School and spent 15 years as director of 
personnel for the Pennsauken School District. 
Along with his dedication to students and 
education, Rick also served in positions of 
civic leadership. He served on the township 
committee for 25 years and served as Mayor 
for nine terms. He also served as a Lector at 
St. Stephen’s and was on the board of the Di-
ocese of Camden’s Office of Black Catholic 
Ministry. Additionally, Mr. Taylor was a Com-
missioner on the Delaware River Port Author-
ity Board and was reappointed to the Board by 
Governor Christie in 2017. 
Among his many accomplishments, Rick re-
ceived Camden County’s MLK Freedom Medal 
for his service to the community of Penn-
sauken for over 40 years and for his work as 
a tireless advocate for children, youth and 
families. 
The residents of Pennsauken, New Jersey 
greatly adored and appreciated Mr. Taylor. His 
passing is a great loss to Pennsauken and our 
entire community, as well as a deeply per-
sonal loss for those who were privileged to 
call him a friend and mentor. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring the late Rick Taylor, of Pennsauken, 
New Jersey, a dedicated public servant who 
fought tirelessly for his students, fellow edu-
cators, his committee members and for the 
constituents of Pennsauken, New Jersey.

HONORING LOUIS GILL 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Louis Gill in celebration 
of his decades of work as a dedicated volun-
teer, leader, and activist in the City of Passaic 
and the Polish community. 
Born to Mr. Ludwig Gill and Ms. Leona 
Stolarz, Mr. Gill’s commitment to service 
began very young. After graduating from Pas-
saic High School in 1957, he attended 
Fairleigh Dickinson College and received a 
bachelor’s degree in Accounting in 1961. After 
becoming the Work Experience and Career 
Exploration Program (W.E.C.E.P.) Coordinator 
and teacher at the Paterson Board of Edu-
cation, Mr. Gill continued to earn multiple de-
grees and certifications for business, edu-
cation, and administration. Following his years 
in school, Mr, Gill founded his own store, Gill’s 
Market, right in his hometown of Passaic. 
Mr. Gill married his beloved wife Mary in 
1963 in Passaic, New Jersey. Together, they 
raised four children and are grandparents to 
four grandchildren. Five years after his wed-
ding, Mr. Gill began his lifelong career in pub-
lic service. He was appointed to the Passaic 
Alcohol and Beverage Control Commission, 
where he served for five years, three of which 
he was the Chairman. In 1977, he was elected 
to the Passaic City Council, where he served 
for another 19 years and eventually became 
the President of the City Council. During his 
service there, Mr. Gill was elected to the New 
Jersey General Assembly to represent the 
36th District for two terms in 1987. 
Mr. Gill’s service to his community here in 
New Jersey and to the Polish community is 
extensive. While pursuing higher education 
and serving his local community, he was the 
Grand Marshall of the Pulaski Day Parade and 
President of the Sons of Poland for five years. 
He also joined the League of American Poles, 
and was a part of the Board of Directors for 
the Polish Cultural Center and Clifton Commu-
nity Center. In addition to getting involved with 
the Polish community, Mr. Gill was also a part 
of the Chopin Singing Society for 50 years, 
where he served as President. 
Mr. Gill’s service to his community is a cred-
it to his character, and he has consistently 
been recognized for his work. He was award-
ed the Outstanding Citizen Award from the 
Pulaski Association of Police and Fire Depart-
ments in 1978. In the following year, he re-
ceived the Citizen of the Year Award from the 
Policemen’s Benevolent Association. Finally, 
as a member of the Passaic-Clifton Y.M.C.A., 
Mr. Gill received the Recognition For Service 
Award in 1985. 
The job of a United States Congressman in-
volves much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to working with and recognizing the 
efforts of individuals like Mr. Gill. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our col-
leagues, friends, family, and the residents of 
New Jersey in recognizing Louis Gill for his 
outstanding work, as we celebrate his dec-
ades of distinguished service to the State of 
New Jersey and the members of his family 
and community.

The Huppes have shared decades of life 
and love together, marrying on January 31, 
1945. Since that date, their family has grown 
to include one daughter, four grandchildren, 
eight great-grandchildren, and one great-great 
grandson, all while living in the same home in 
Rochester. 
Together they have enjoyed many adven-
tures, celebrated great achievements, and per-
severed through life’s challenges. Mr. Huppe 
answered his nation’s call, serving in the Pa-
cific during World War II, where his distin-
guished service earned him the Silver Star. 
And Mrs. Huppe recently celebrated her 100th 
birthday in May 2019. May your love and com-
mitment continue to serve as an inspiration to 
us all. 
On behalf on my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
wish Mr. and Mrs. Huppe a very happy 75th 
anniversary. I hope they enjoy a wonderful 
celebration with their family.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 180TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF SUMPTER TOWN-
SHIP 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 180th anniversary of 
Sumpter Township. 
Sumpter Township can trace its origins back 
to the revolutionary war era. As one of the 
original bounty land act areas off the Erie 
Canal, Sumpter’s first settlers were revolu-
tionary war soldiers looking for large land 
tracks and farm land out west. On April 6, 
1840, the Township of Sumpter—named after 
revolutionary war General Thomas Sumter— 
was officially formed, home to a total of 228 
residents. In the years that followed, Sumpter 
Township became a busy town with shopping 
districts, a town hall, the first producing oil well 
in Wayne County, and its own school district. 
Since its humble beginnings in the mid-nine-
teenth century, Sumpter Township has grown 
and transformed significantly. Today, Sumpter 
Township is a diverse community of 9,549 
residents drawing from a variety of ethnic and 
socio-economic backgrounds. Even 180 years 
later, Sumpter Township continues to be an 
important component of our Michigan commu-
nity. Its woodlands, wetlands, prairies, parks, 
and abundant wildlife are natural treasures for 
all Michiganders to value and enjoy, and its 
welcoming, neighborly, and tight-knit commu-
nity serves as a model that others should 
strive to emulate. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the 180th anniversary of 
Sumpter Township. As one of Michigan’s ear-
liest communities, it is my wish that Sumpter 
Township continues to be a pleasant place for 
people to live, work, and enjoy the vast beauty 
Michigan has to offer. Congratulations on this 
historic milestone, and best of luck in the 
years ahead. 
HONORING THE BRUCE 
ELEMENTARY 3 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to give special recognition to the Bruce 3, the 
three first graders who integrated Bruce Ele-
mentary School in Memphis in 1961, and to 
the artist who so thoughtfully depicted that his-
toric event in a mural on the school’s cafeteria 
walls. Harry Williams, Dwania Kyles and 
Menelik Fombi were the courageous pioneers, 
part of the Memphis 13, who integrated the 
Memphis school system that year. 
Memphian Jamond Bullock’s mural of the 
Bruce students was unveiled in a ceremony 
on January 17 at which I was proud to speak. 
I reminded the current students, teachers, 
Shelby County School Board officials, other 
alumni and school supporters that it was my 
friend, the late Civil Rights advocate and long-
time judge Russell Sugarmon, who came up 
with the idea that it should be first graders in-
tegrating Memphis’ public schools. This was 
unlike the practice at Little Rock Central High 
School in Arkansas, in 1957, where older stu-
dents who were integrating the school incurred 
the taunts of angry mobs and federal troops 
were called in to keep the peace. 
Judge Sugarmon said that escorting the Ma-
lone twins, Sheila and Sharon, into Gordon El-
ementary School in 1961 was one of his 
proudest moments. The Bruce 3 endured the 
loneliness and ostracism of being the only Af-
rican Americans in the otherwise all-white 
school, and did not even share the same 
classrooms. They were heroes and so were 
their courageous parents. 
Menelik Fombi’s father, A.W. Willis Jr., was 
a leading Civil Rights advocate and Russell 
Sugarmon’s law partner at the time. A.W. Wil-
lis Jr. and Russell Sugarmon were the first 
and second African Americans elected to the 
Tennessee General Assembly since Recon-
struction. Dwania Kyles’ father, the late Rev-
erend Samuel Billy Kyles, pastor of Monu-
mental Baptist Church, was one of the last to 
speak with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. before 
he was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel in 
April 1968. 
Artist Jamond Bullock, founder of AlivePaint, 
is a nationally recognized mural designer and 
painter who has enlivened the walls of build-
ings in Memphis with uplifting imagery. His 
Bruce Elementary painting, which he com-
pleted over two and a half months during 
school holidays and off hours, was inspired by 
the courage of the three Bruce students, and 
he has said he is proud that current students 
will be reminded of their predecessors’ cour-
age and sacrifice. He has done our city a 
great service. I was pleased to speak with the 
Bruce students, young and old, and to cele-
brate this important chapter in Memphis and 
American history. 
HONORING 
THE 
30TH 
ANNUAL 
MARTIN 
LUTHER 
KING, 
JR. 
YOUTH ORATORICAL CONTEST 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the 35th Annual Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Day Celebration and the cornerstone of the 
event, the 30th Annual Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Youth Oratorical Contest, hosted by the Prince 
William Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma 
Theta Sorority, Incorporated. 
Every year, members of the community 
gather on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day to reflect 
upon the past year and receive a message of 
hope from the youth of today and leaders of 
tomorrow. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. will forever be enshrined in our his-
tory as the formative figure in the quest for 
justice through civil dialogue. 
Dr. King has continued to be an inspiration 
to all for generations. Many have answered 
his call to both stand up and call out inequal-
ities that we still see today. The struggle for 
freedom that Dr. King was fighting for was 
brought to the forefront during the March on 
Washington. On that day, while standing in 
front of the Lincoln Memorial, Dr. King fa-
mously said ‘‘Let Freedom Ring’’ which is fit-
tingly the theme for this year’s Oratorical Con-
test. He wanted our youth to have the future 
they are seeing today, free to reach unlimited 
heights. The talented students who are partici-
pating in this contest are true examples of the 
continuous efforts Dr. King wanted from us all. 
I congratulate the following contestants in 
the 30th Annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Youth 
Oratorical Contest: 
Middle School Contestants: Nyela Asterilla 
Anderson—Hampton Middle School; Kamari 
Chisolm—Bull Run Middle School; Myles 
Lainer—Manassas Park Middle School. 
High School Contestants: Zion Fozo—Poto-
mac High School; Jessica Gyamfi—Colgan 
High School; Hanaan Khabir—Osbourn Park 
High School. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in commending the Prince William 
Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Soror-
ity, Inc. for showcasing the power of purpose-
ful and meaningful communication reminiscent 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and in congratu-
lating the talented youth of the 2020 MLK 
Youth Oratorical Contest.

2016. Although she had the task of juggling 
the roles of a full-time wife, mother of two 
daughters, a student, and an employee, her 
life has been quite a challenge and a reward-
ing experience. As she continued the journey 
to pursue her degree and stay actively en-
gaged in her community, she is reminded of 
an encouraging scripture, ‘‘For I know the 
plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans 
to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to 
give you hope and a future’’ (Jeremiah 29:11). 
Captain Peppers enrolled in the Master of 
Education in Curriculum and Instruction with a 
concentration in Leadership Cognate at Liberty 
University. After 22 years since completing her 
studies at Jackson State University, she main-
tained a 4.0 GPA during her first semester in 
the program, only by God’s grace and mercy. 
Veronica received a new assignment in the 
Mississippi Army National Guard as a Training 
Officer of the 298th Combat Sustainment Sup-
port Battalion in Philadelphia, Mississippi, 
where she provides operation and training 
management guidance to the battalion for 
more than 630 service members. Her addi-
tional duties included Equal Opportunity Advi-
sor, Antiterrorism Officer, and Family Readi-
ness Group Coordinator. 
She is a graduate of Leadership Madison 
County (1990) and a current life member of 
both National Guard Association of the United 
States and National Guard Association of Mis-
sissippi, where she currently serves on the 
board of directors as the Company Grade Offi-
cer Representative. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Captain Veronica Peppers.

IOWAN OF THE WEEK MARY 
CAMPOS 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Ms. Mary Campos, a longtime 
Iowan civil rights activist. Campos was the first 
Latina inducted into the Iowa Women’s Hall of 
Fame. In 2017, she received the American 
Civil Liberties Union Edward S. Allen Award 
for her time helping non-English speaking fam-
ilies learn English and helping them through 
the steps to become a U.S. Citizen. She has 
also earned the Ohtli Award, the highest honor 
given from the Mexican government to a Mexi-
can descendent for her work assisting Mexi-
can immigrants. She has served on the Iowa 
Civil Rights Commission and the League for 
United Latin American Citizens and was one 
of the founders of the National Black and 
Brown Forum. Campos, who turned 90 in No-
vember, is still serving her community in var-
ious capacities. 
Ms. Campos received an honorary nursing 
degree from the Des Moines Area Community 
College. Al Exito, a catalyst for the empower-
ment of Latino youth in Iowa, conducted the 
third annual Mary E. Campos Luncheon where 
DMACC President, Rob Denson, presented 
the honorary degree. Al Exito started the Mary 
E. 
Campos 
Scholarship 
to 
help 
honor 
Campos’ dream of seeing young people, es-
pecially students of color, earn higher edu-
cation degrees and fill positions of leadership 
within their communities. 
It is an honor to celebrate the outstanding 
achievements of Ms. Campos and celebrate 
the determination and hard work that she and 
other activists like her have put into Iowa. I 
have great respect and admiration for folks 
who stand up for people who can’t always 
stand up for themselves, and I am humbled by 
Ms. Campos’ decades and decades of bravery 
and compassion. 
I applaud Ms. Mary Campos for her unwav-
ering dedication. Let us be of service this Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. Day, and remember the im-
portant work of Dr. King that lives on in people 
like Mary Campos.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LARRY J. 
RAVEN 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the life of Larry J. Raven, who 
passed away on January 6, 2020. Larry was 
an appointee to the City of Fresno Parks 
Commission, the blue-ribbon Zoo Commission 
and the General Plan Commission for over 40 
years. 
Larry J. Raven was born on January 25, 
1939 in Selma, California to Isabel and Phil 
Raven and was a lifelong Fresno County resi-
dent. He and his older brother, Jerry W. 
Raven started a dairy on their parent’s ranch 
when Larry was just 13. Larry was active in 
Future Farmers of America at Selma Union 
High School, serving as president in 1957. He 
earned the title of California Farmer and in 
1958 achieved the highest honor of American 
Farmer. In 1961, he and his brother opened a 
drive-thru grocery store in Selma and sold 
their own brand of milk, Roselane. 
In June of 1963, Larry married the love of 
his life Penny Nichelini. Two years later, 
Penny and Larry opened the first R Pantry 
Market, a drive-thru grocery market. In a few 
short years they had 9 convenience stores 
and an additional 3 old fashioned meat mar-
kets called, Holy Cow Meat Markets. Always 
ahead of his time, the R Pantry Markets, Inc. 
was the first franchised convenience market 
chain in the state of California and the first 
business in the state to offer self-service gaso-
line pumps. 
In the 1970s, Larry and Penny purchased 
an old winery in Selma, renamed it Raven Al-
cohol Distillery, and converted it to California’s 
first fuel alcohol distillery, producing thousands 
of gallons of product daily. He became a na-
tional expert on the conversion of molasses to 
fuel alcohol and obtained a U.S. Patent in 
2002 for his ‘‘Process and Apparatus for Con-
version of Biodegradable Organic Material into 
Product Gas’’. 
In the 1970s, both Larry and Penny became 
licensed California Real Estate brokers and 
founded The Raven Company. Shortly after, 
Larry became a licensed California Contractor 
and built his first subdivision in Selma, eventu-
ally building over 1,000 family homes and 
neighborhoods. For the America’s Bicenten-
nial, Larry spearheaded the idea of planting 
thousands of red, white and blue petunias 
along the old boulevard and it was designated 
‘‘America’s Largest, Private Bicentennial Dis-
play’’. Larry was an outspoken supporter of 
the completion of Highways 41, 180 and 168 
and invited the California Highway Commis-
sion to meet in Fresno; at his urging the Com-
mission voted to allocate the funds to build 
Highway 41. 
In the 1980s, Larry and his sons began the 
yuletide tradition of ‘‘Candlelight Christmas on 
Huntington Boulevard’’ with over 100 home-
owners decorating their homes which de-
lighted tens of thousands of visitors annually 
and continued for 21 years. Larry also orga-
nized an effort to paint the 52 classic 
lampposts in the historic mile, becoming the 
largest private improvement ever made to city 
property and featured in Sunset Magazine. 
Between 2010–2015, the couple acquired sev-
eral ranches with plans to build subdivisions. 
As a result, Larry went back to his roots and 
became a successful farmer, devoting most of 
his time to a 120-acre ranch in Sanger with or-
anges and almonds. 
Larry is survived by his wife, Penny and 
their sons Tagge and Corbyn; Corbyn’s wife 
Stephanie Raven and their four children, Bella, 
Carsyn, Audrey Grace and Declyn Raven; his 
brother Jerry W. Raven and wife LaVerne 
Raven and many nephews and a niece. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Larry J. Raven. His 
commitment and dedication to the Central Val-
ley community left an impact on many. We 
join his family and friends in honoring his great 
life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
KATHLEEN WEBER 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Kathleen Weber, who 
passed away on January 18, 2020, at the age 
of 75 after a lifetime of public service to her 
community. 
Born in Santa Rosa on August 27, 1944, 
Kathleen was raised by her father who worked 
in the insurance industry and her mother who 
designed costumes for the Santa Rosa Junior 
College theater program. She met and fell in 
love with Ed Weber at in the theater program 
at Santa Rosa Junior College and married him 
in 1964. Kathleen worked in the medical field 
and the former Mattei Brothers clothing store, 
before embarking on what became an out-
standing and renowned baking career. 
Kathleen’s father-in-law introduced her to 
baking bread on his personal wood-burning 
oven. This quickly became a full-time hobby 
for Kathleen, which blossomed into a profes-
sion through study under renowned brick-oven 
baker Alan Scott. The Webers fashioned their 
own oven based on Mr. Scott’s design, and 
proceeded to launch a business that has since 
been credited with renewing the appeal of 
slow-rise bread regionally. Their biggest break 
came when they became the bread supplier to 
Thomas Keller, world famous chef and owner 
of French Laundry restaurant. Mr. Keller later 
became a close friend and collaborator with 
the Webers. 
In 2004, the Webers opened Della Fattoria 
as a breakfast, lunch, and weekend brunch 
restaurant where Kathleen worked tirelessly to 
welcome patrons and give back to her home-
town community. Around 2016, the Webers’ 
son, Chef Aaron, started a prix-fixe dinner 
menu focusing on the farm-to-table method 
Kathleen had started with Della Breads, and in 
2018, added to it a full dinner menu. In 2019, 
Della Fattoria undertook a large dining hall ex-
pansion onto two adjacent properties, and 
their daughter, Elisa, oversaw the interior de-
sign and fabrication of the furniture, making 
the business venture another full family effort. 
One of the first on the West Coast to com-
mercially produce bread using the brick oven 
process, Kathleen and her family took local 
door-to-door offerings into a regional and high 
demand delicacy. She became a published 
author with ‘‘Della Fattoria Bread,’’ a recipe 
book seeking to make high-quality baking 
more accessible to the home cook. In addition 
to her culinary contributions to the community 
and support of the local food movement and 
local business chamber, Kathleen’s public 
service expanded to include providing meals 
to first responders in Petaluma during the 
Sonoma County wildfires. She is credited for 
always looking for new ways to get Petaluma 
on the map. 
Kathleen is survived by her husband Ed, her 
two children Aaron and Elisa, and her two 
grandsons Jakob and Samuel. While she will 
be greatly missed by many, Kathleen Weber’s 
legacy will live on through the indelible posi-
tive impact she had on this community and 
beyond.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHARLES A.

SCHOOL AS IT IS NAMED A 2019 
NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Charles A. Lindbergh Ele-
mentary School as it is named a 2019 Na-
tional Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education. The school’s impact on the 
children of our community is worthy of com-
mendation. 
Located in Dearborn, Charles A. Lindbergh 
Elementary School is a cornerstone of our 
Michigan community. The school is dedicated 
to helping students reach their full potential as 
empathetic, balanced, and goal-oriented lead-
ers who strive to effect change and make 
meaningful contributions to their communities. 
With a focus on cultivating strong relation-
ships, Charles A. Lindbergh Elementary builds 
a positive and supportive school culture that 
helps students gain the confidence they need 
to embrace academics and accomplish any-
thing they set out to achieve. 
The National Blue Ribbon Award is a pres-
tigious honor, only bestowed upon the most 
outstanding schools. By inspiring children to 
achieve greatness by learning and leading 
every day, Charles A. Lindbergh Elementary 
School is a deserving recipient of this great 
honor. Charles A. Lindbergh Elementary has 
made a difference in our community and con-
tinues to be a place where students, edu-
cators, and families work together to create a 
safe, welcoming, and academically rigorous 
program that promotes success. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Charles A. Lindbergh Elemen-
tary School as it is named a 2019 National 
Blue Ribbon School. The award is a testament 
to the exceptional guidance of its teachers and 
staff who work every day to ensure quality 
educational experiences, achievement out-
comes, and success for each and every stu-
dent. I am grateful for the school’s profound 
impact on our community and wish it contin-
ued success in the years ahead.

Friday, January 24, 2020 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today

dent Donnette Petersen on celebrating her 
100th birthday. 
Donnette has been a Green River resident 
for much of her life. She has been a staple of 
the Green River community and was known 
as quite the cook when she was younger and 
would host large dinner parties with friends. 
Donnette has been an example to her commu-
nity and that was evidenced by the outpouring 
of support at her birthday parties. This is a 
wonderful time to celebrate Donnette and 
thank her for her contributions to Green River 
and the great state of Wyoming.

HONORING THE CAREER OF BILL 
FREY 
HON. JAMES A. HIMES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor one of the heroes of the fight for decent 
housing and meaningful opportunity for every 
American—my role model, my former boss, 
and my friend, Bill Frey. Bill will attempt to re-
tire from Enterprise Community Partners at the 
end of January after three decades of shaping 
that institution, mentoring generations of com-
mitted leaders and improving the lives of 
countless Americans. I say attempt, because 
Bill’s soul-deep commitment to fighting the 
world’s fight and to servant leadership will not 
fade with the passage of time. 
Enterprise’s need, and the respect Bill com-
mands in the world of community develop-
ment, may conspire to make Bill’s attempt at 
retirement a rare failure for a man who has 
achieved everything, and always for others. 
Bill’s deep commitment to selfless service, 
his unusual humility, and his intuitive sense for 
gentle leadership is leavened by an impish 
humor that makes Bill irresistible to all, from 
the formerly homeless new renter to the senior 
banking executive, to the faith and community 
leaders that he empowered and supported 
across a lifetime. 
Madam Speaker, the years in which I 
worked for Bill Frey were years of inspiration, 
learning and always laughter. I grew immeas-
urably watching Bill’s steady hand, his coura-
geous personal fights, and the example he set 
for so many of us. 
I’m not going to say I will miss him, because 
as I said, I suspect he’s not really going any-
where. And even if he does manage to spend 
more time with his wonderful family and grow-
ing collection of grandchildren, his legacy 
touched so many of us forever. Thank you, 
Bill.

RECOGNIZING 
ELIZABETH 
RINK 
AND MONICA SKEWES OF BOZE-
MAN AND ADRIANN RICKER OF 
FORT PECK 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Elizabeth Rink and Monica 
Skewes of Bozeman, and Adriann Ricker of 
Fort Peck for their dedication to and pursuit of 
finding solutions to public health issues con-
fronting Montana. 
Rink, Skewes, and Ricker, an enrolled 
member of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and 
Sioux Tribes, have spent years working with 
members and leaders of the Fort Peck Indian 
Reservation 
community 
on 
public 
health 
issues it faces. Through community-based re-
search, they are helping develop trauma-in-
formed policies for reservation agencies. All 
three are working vigorously alongside tribal 
members to find solutions. Montana State Uni-
versity faculty members Rink and Skewes as 
well as Ricker from Fott Peck Community Col-
lege were recently selected for the Inter-
disciplinary Research Leaders Program, which 
is supported by the Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation. The fellowship allows them to 
continue this important work. 
Their goal is to equip Fort Peck’s leaders 
with data that can guide their policymaking. 
Their research supports a more compas-
sionate, community-centered approach to ad-
dress the long-term needs of those seeking 
help. The three researchers say if a person 
never heals from tragic circumstances like 
substance abuse or addiction then the harmful 
cycles don’t end. 
Rink, Skewes, and Ricker empower Fort 
Peck leaders with data. As a result of their 
work and collaboration, tribal leaders have 
more information to better understand these 
complex public health issues. Their research 
and work are making a difference: many of 
members of the community are more accept-
ing of and sensitive to these challenges and 
hardships than they were before. 
Madam Speaker, for their community col-
laboration and tireless work to promote posi-
tive community change, I recognize Elizabeth 
Rink and Monica Skewes of Bozeman, and 
Adriann Ricker of Fort Peck for their Spirit of 
Montana.

IN HONOR OF HELEN ZIGMOND 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember and honor the life of Cheyenne 
resident Helen Zigmond. 
Born in Czechoslovakia on October 27, 
1927, Helen and her family were abducted 
and taken to Auschwitz during the Nazi occu-
pation in WWII. In 1954 Helen and her hus-
band, Eugene, moved to Cheyenne where 
they stayed for the rest of their lives. Helen 
took pride in her music store and was active 
in the local synagogue and the community. 
Helen was the last known Holocaust survivor 
in Wyoming and her presence in the Chey-
enne community will be greatly missed. Her 
story, and those of other survivors, must serve 
as a reminder to future generations that we all 
have an obligation to pledge ‘‘Never Again.’’ 
Again, Madam Speaker, I want to honor and 
celebrate the life of Helen Zigmond and ex-
tend my condolences to her friends and fam-
ily.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF BILLIE 
AUBRY HITT 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Billie Aubry 
Hitt, who passed away on January 21st at the 
age of 81. 
Billie, a lifelong resident of Calhoun County, 
Mississippi, answered the call to serve our 
great nation with the National Guard and later 
enlisted in the United States Air Force. His ca-
reer took him all over the world, then brought 
him back home to Mississippi at the Columbus 
Air Force Base. Billie later retired and returned 
to Calhoun County, where he served as both 
Justice Court Judge and as Sheriff. 
Billie, a member of Lewis Memorial United 
Methodist Church, set an example of faith for 
his family to follow. He was an active member 
in his community with the Post 50 American 
Legion, Disabled American Veterans, National 
Order of Trench Rats, Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, Mississippi Sons of Confederate Vet-
erans, the Calhoun City Rotary Club, the Sons 
of Confederate Veterans Camp 1969 and the 
Calhoun County Republican Party. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, 
Geneise Winters Hitt, as well as many friends 
and family members. Billie Hitt’s life was one 
of service, grace, love for his family, and com-
munity. He will be greatly missed by all whom 
he encountered.

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable

work, dedication and the desire to serve oth-
ers. 
Mrs. Tate and her husband, Nelson, are

dedication and tenacity to serving her commu-
nity and desire to be an example for all.

HATHA-
WAY FOR A DISTINGUISHED CA-
REER WITH THE THIRD JUDICIAL 
CIRCUIT COURT 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Cynthia Gray Hathaway 
on her retirement and recognize her years of 
distinguished service with the Third Judicial 
Circuit Court of Michigan. Her contributions to 
our community are worthy of commendation. 
Cynthia Gray Hathaway received her bach-
elor’s degree in business administration from 
Wayne State University and earned her mas-
ter’s degree in criminal justice from the Univer-
sity of Detroit. While working toward her mas-
ter’s, Hathaway simultaneously was employed 
by the Detroit Recorder’s Court Probation De-
partment where she became intrigued about 
law. Later, Hathaway pursued this interest and 
received her law degree from the Detroit Col-
lege of Law. 
Cynthia Gray Hathaway has become a cor-
nerstone of our Michigan community. As a 
judge of the Third Circuit Court in Wayne 
County, Hathaway’s commitment to justice 
and the residents of Michigan has made a dif-
ference. Beyond her work in a professional ca-
pacity, Hathaway has also been a dedicated 
community member who is active in the 
NAACP, Detroit Urban League, the Women’s 
Economic Club, and the Reggie McKenzie 
Foundation, among many others. Hathaway is 
known for her high degree of professionalism, 
kind demeanor, and passion for helping every-
one she encounters. She has demonstrated 
her commitment to the entire Michigan com-
munity, and it my honor and privilege to recog-
nize her distinguished work today. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Cynthia Gray Hathaway as 
she retires from the Third Circuit Court. We 
thank her for her many years of service and 
leadership and wish her the best of luck in all 
future endeavors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E70 
January 24, 2020 
The American Legion Auxiliary is a premier 
service organization that has been a vital 
asset to our community. By providing support 
for our veterans, our military, and their fami-
lies, the American Legion Auxiliary shapes a 
positive future in an atmosphere of fellowship, 
patriotism, and peace. 
Founded in 1919, the American Legion Aux-
iliary boasts almost one million members from 
a range of different backgrounds. This past 
year, the organization oversaw more than 40 
million volunteer hours and raised $37 million 
for charities across the U.S. 
Specifically, the American Legion Auxiliary’s 
Gilbert D. Karsten Post 33, has been a pillar 
in our community through their support of vet-
erans, sponsorship of local events, and exten-
sive youth development programs. Their tire-
less work has dramatically increased the qual-
ity of life for veterans and their families across 
West Michigan. 
The post gets their name from the late Gil-
bert Dean Karsten, an American army Cor-
poral who was killed on the battlefields of 
France on August 2, 1917. Gilbert D. Karsten 
was born in Zeeland, MI, on April 20, 1898, 
and joined the U.S. Army just days after the 
U.S. declared war on Germany. His death 
made him the first World War I casualty from 
Zeeland, and the community has continued to 
honor his sacrifice by using his name to help 
further their commitment to serving local vet-
erans and their families. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating the American Legion Auxiliary and 
the Gilbert D. Karsten Post 33 for their 100 
years 
of 
dedicated 
service 
to 
veterans 
throughout our country and in West Michigan.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF CHARLES 
PENNINGTON 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of my 
friend, Charles Pennington, Junior, who was a 
true American patriot and an economic devel-
opment engine for London, Kentucky. 
Charlie was a thriving work horse every day 
that he had the ability to serve others. He 
dedicated 26 years to law enforcement, first 
as a Kentucky State Trooper, until he was 
drafted for the Korean War. He honorably 
served this great Nation in the U.S. Army from 
1955 to 1959. When he returned home to 
American soil, he was sworn in as a Laurel 
County Sheriff’s Deputy. One year later, he 
became a Deputy U.S. Marshal and partici-
pated in some of the nation’s most historic 
moments in time. In fact, he escorted the first 
African American student into an integrated 
school and was featured in Norman Rock-
well’s captivating painting of that fateful day. 
During my first year in office, representing 
Kentucky’s Fifth Congressional District, I was 
honored to recommend Charlie’s promotion to 
U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Ken-
tucky. President Ronald Reagan appointed 
him to the role, serving 67 Kentucky counties, 
until his retirement. 
During what could have been long restful 
years of retirement, Charlie invested his time 
and energy to recruiting businesses and cre-
ating new jobs in Laurel County through the 
London Planning and Zoning Commission and 
the London Laurel County Industrial Author-
ity—and he wasn’t just good at it, he was 
great. Charlie helped transform Laurel County 
into an industrial hub for our entire region. He 
was instrumental in developing a desperately 
needed new industrial park, which now right-
fully bears his name. Thanks to his tireless ef-
forts to lay a healthy economic foundation and 
landscape in Laurel County, the I–75 corridor 
will continue to progress for generations to fol-
low. 
Aside from his official duties, Charlie volun-
teered countless hours to the Laurel County 
Fire Department and other civic organizations. 
He made a difference in our region and we 
can already see the growth made possible by 
his dedication. I am forever grateful for his 
friendship and partnership on economic devel-
opment projects over the years. My wife, Cyn-
thia, and I extend our heartfelt condolences to 
Charlie’s entire family and his countless 
friends across the state.

RECOGNIZING THE PUBLIC SERV-
ICE AND RETIREMENT OF KEVIN 
J. BRADY 
HON. CAROL D. MILLER 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Kevin J. Brady, who is retiring 
from his position as Executive Director over 
the Greater Huntington Park & Recreation Dis-
trict. Mr. Brady has been involved in various 
public service roles, both inside and outside 
the hills of Appalachia, for well over 32 years. 
Mr. Brady is truly a dedicated civil servant 
whose work has sought to significantly benefit 
the quality of life of Southern West Virginia 
and the Tri-State Region surrounding Hun-
tington. 
In 1989, Mr. Brady started his life of service 
by becoming a Landscape Coordinator for 
Hamilton County, Tennessee. During this time, 
Mr. Brady pioneered several projects that 
oversaw the management of the Tennessee 
Riverwalk, Tennessee Riverpark, and the 
Chester Frost Park. Excelling in his duties, Mr. 
Brady would later become the Director of 
Parks for the City of Chattanooga. He served 
in these roles for a total of 20 years until 2009 
when he moved to Juneau, Alaska to serve as 
their Superintendent of Parks and Landscape; 
however, when the Greater Huntington Park & 
Recreation District needed an Executive Direc-
tor in 2010, he answered the call to return to 
the heart of Appalachia. 
Over the last ten years, Mr. Brady has prov-
en time and time again that he is a true asset 
to Huntington and the Mountain State. His 
passion project, St. Cloud Commons all-inclu-
sive playground, has already brought happi-
ness to countless children in Huntington. It is 
because of people like Mr. Brady that make 
me proud to represent West Virginia’s Third 
Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally recognize Mr. 
Brady for this momentous achievement. I ask 
you and my colleagues to join me in sending 
him, his wife Suzanne, his daughter Rhiannon, 
and their three grandchildren, gratitude and 
well wishes upon his retirement.

ELIAS ‘‘LOUIE’’ HORIATES 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend the Penn-
sauken, New Jersey resident Elias ‘‘Louie’’ 
Horiates, a Camden County Town Hall Hon-
oree. 
Elias Horiates was born in Greece in 1933, 
he was the oldest of nine brothers and sisters. 
At the age of fourteen, his family immigrated 
to the land of opportunity, the United States of 
America, to start a new life in the Township of 
Pennsauken, New Jersey. 
In 1956, at the age of 23 he was drafted 
into the United States Army and defended our 
great nation overseas. Mr. Horiates completed 
basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey and 
began his first two years of service overseas 
in Germany. After his return to the United 
States he continued his service at Fort Camp-
bell and at the Armory on 42nd and Federal 
Street. During his service Mr. Horiates re-
quested a special discharge to return home for 
temporary leave to elope with his childhood 
sweetheart, Hrisoula. Mr. Horiates was lucky 
enough to receive a generous 60-day leave to 
return home, one that was rarely granted. 
In 1962, Mr. Horiates completed his service 
in the United States Army as a sergeant after 
6 years of valiant service. When he returned 
home from his military service, Mr. and Mrs. 
Horiates bought their first home in Penn-
sauken, New Jersey along the road of West 
River Drive where they would raise their family 
of three sons and one daughter. 
Back in his hometown, Mr. Horiates went on 
to work for Hutchinson Plumbing for 45 years. 
Mr. Horiates served two terms as the Presi-
dent of Saint Thomas Greek Orthodox Church 
and served as the President of the American 
Hellenic Educational Progressive Association 
of South Jersey. 
Mr. Horiates is a proud and patriotic Amer-
ican, he values the time he spent in the United 
States Army and cherishes his life and the op-
portunities he was given in our great country. 
In their retirement, Louie and Hrisoula have 
continued to live in their home in Pennsauken, 
New Jersey for fifty-five years as active mem-
bers in their community and country. Their leg-
acy continues with their four children, seven 
grandchildren and their four great-grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Mr. Elias ‘‘Louie’’ Horiates, of Penn-
sauken, New Jersey, a resident dedicated to 
his community and who served his country 
valiantly.

IN RECOGNITION OF RORY GAM-
BLE AS HE RECEIVES THE LET 
FREEDOM RING AWARD 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Rory Gamble’s distin-
guished career and honor his remarkable work 
as he receives the Rainbow PUSH Let Free-
dom Ring Award. Gamble’s contributions to 
our community are worthy of commendation. 
In 1974, Rory Gamble joined the UAW after 
he was hired at the Ford Motor Co. Dearborn 
Frame Plant. He quickly became active in 
UAW Local 600 and has since become a cor-
nerstone of the labor union. Throughout his 
tenure, Gamble has served in numerous elect-
ed and appointed positions including plant 
trustee, alternate benefit representative, bar-
gaining committee chair, and director, to name 
a few. Gamble’s leadership and ability to work 
through difficult challenges were recognized 
by many, leading him to be elected a vice 
president of the UAW in June 2018. Most re-
cently, Gamble was named President of the 
UAW by the UAW International Executive 
Board on December 5, 2019. 
As the UAW’s first black president, Rory 
Gamble is recognized as a humble, compas-
sionate, and honest leader who strives to ef-
fect meaningful change throughout all his 
work. Gamble took over the reins of the UAW 
at a critical moment in the union’s history and 
has spent his first weeks instituting a series of 
ethics reforms and policy changes to set the 
UAW back on course. Despite the hardships, 
Gamble has remained optimistic and is dedi-
cated to working together to navigate through 
the challenges. Gamble’s work has truly made 
a difference, and his guidance will be impera-
tive in the UAW’s future success. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Rory Gamble. Gamble’s tenac-
ity for change and commitment to improving 
the lives of UAW members, their families, and 
the communities in which they live makes him 
a deserving recipient of the Let Freedom Ring 
Award. I am grateful for his impact on our 
community and wish him continued success in 
the years ahead.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND AC-
COMPLISHMENTS OF KEVIN AN-
DREW GALLAGHER 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of my friend Kevin Andrew 
Gallagher, who has been diagnosed with a 
terminal illness. I had the opportunity to attend 
a service ‘‘celebrating the life and antics of 
Kevin Gallagher’’ at the National Ornamental 
Metal Museum last Sunday at which my friend 
was honored by his many friends, relatives 
and colleagues. It was his opportunity to see, 
and for his children to see, how he will be re-
membered. Kevin, 48, a masterful public rela-
tions and government relations consultant, 
was my campaign manager and put together 
a great team for my election victory for Con-
gress in 2006, one of the first elections in 
which we were able to get beyond race and 
gender. Kevin also worked on A C Wharton’s 
first campaign for Shelby County Mayor and 
later served as his director of public affairs. He 
also worked on Jim Strickland’s first run for 
the Memphis City Council. He was appointed 
to the Tennessee Commission on Children 
and Youth by Governor Don Sundquist and 
was involved in reforming the juvenile justice 
system. He served on the Center City Com-
mission and on the boards of the Memphis 
Redbirds, the Riverfront Development Cor-
poration and the National Ornamental Metal 
Museum. In fact, Kevin is a blacksmith and 
bladesmith who said that when he got tired of 
talking to people, ‘‘I go beat on metal.’’ The 
museum where the service was held has cre-
ated a scholarship program in his name to 
support the development of emerging black-
smiths and metalsmiths. At the service, one 
friend recalled that he was ‘‘fueled by a sense 
of humor,’’ but never punched down; he tar-
geted political authority and had a funny way 
of speaking truth to power. Another recalled 
the work he did to get the criminal records of 
past offenders expunged so they could find 
work and how he helped struggling artisans 
through addictions and hard times. Kevin also 
liked to cook and catered dinners for various 
groups. He had a food blog and recently pub-
lished Always Have A Chicken: A Cookbook 
For My Kids with 75 family recipes. Kevin’s 
wife, Stacy, and his three children, Clayton 
Stone, Molly Gallagher and Spencer Galla-
gher, attended Sunday’s service to express 
their love and saw that love returned. Kevin 
has led a wonderful life and has made a dif-
ference in the lives of so many others. He will 
be forever remembered.

HONORING DR. RONALD D. MOORE 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Dr. Ronald D. Moore of 
Chowchilla, California, who passed away on 
January 14, 2020. Dr. Moore leaves behind a 
legacy of steadfast service to his country, 
community, and family. 
Dr. Moore was born in Madera, California 
on October 16, 1939 and graduated from 
Chowchilla High School in 1957. Later that 
year, he joined the United States Marine 
Corps Reserve and later went on to graduate 
from Fresno State. In 1961, he married Shirley 
Marie Pacheco at St. Joachim’s Catholic 
Church in Madera. Dr. Moore attended Officer 
Candidate School in 1966 and was commis-
sioned a 2nd Lieutenant after graduating as 
the honor man of his platoon. Dr. Moore then 
began a distinguished career as a Marine. 
Dr. Moore served in Vietnam as a platoon 
leader, executive officer, and company com-
mander from 1967 to 1968 and upon his re-
turn, was promoted to Captain. He then 
served with the Fifth Marine Division, Third 
Regiment until he retired in 1969. During his 
service, he was awarded many medals, in-
cluding the Navy Commendation Medal with a 
bronze ‘‘V’’, the National Service Defense 
Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, and the Re-
public ofVietnam Gallantry Cross—Foreign 
with a bronze service star, among others. 
After his retirement from the Marines Corps, 
Dr. Moore returned to Chowchilla with his fam-
ily and began his career in education as a 
teacher and coach of football and track at 
Chowchilla Union High School. Dr. Moore later 
became the Superintendent of Schools and 
held that position for 23 years until his retire-
ment in 1999. 
Throughout his life, Dr. Moore remained in-
volved in his community and committed to 
making it a better place. He was a member of 
many organizations including VFW Post 9886, 
the Third Marine Division Association, the Ma-
rines Memorial Club of San Francisco, Rotary 
International, and the Fresno State Bulldog 
Foundation, where he was honored as ‘‘Hero 
of the Game’’ at a Fresno State football game 
in 2017. 
Dr. Moore enjoyed spending time with his 
family and traveling with his wife Shirley. To-
gether, they traveled to a variety of countries, 
including a return to Vietnam in 2006 and par-
ticularly 
enjoyed 
their 
annual 
Caribbean 
cruises. As a lifelong student of history, Dr. 
Moore published two novels in retirement, 
‘‘Chopper Caper’’ and ‘‘Dragon Force: The 
Last Salute.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in honoring a man whose service to 
our country and his community have undoubt-
edly made the world a better place. It is both 
fitting and appropriate we honor him as many 
gather to celebrate his legacy. I wish Dr. 
Moore’s family and friends the best as they 
celebrate his life.

IN MEMORY OF ED WALDHEIM 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the incredible life of Ed Waldheim, 
who passed away on December 9, 2019 at 
the age of 81. Mr. Waldheim was a lifelong 
off-road enthusiast who spent decades advo-
cating passionately for expanding access to 
public lands. 
Ed Waldheim was born in San Francisco in 
1938. After growing up in Argentina, he joined 
the United States Army when he became an 
adult and later settled in Southern California. 
In the 1970s California deserts, Ed learned to 
ride motorcycles and developed his passion 
for recreating on public lands. He helped off- 
roaders band together to advocate for contin-
ued access to public lands and was an early 
supporter of the California Off Road Vehicle 
Association (CORVA). Over his career of pub-
lic advocacy, he served as President of 
CORVA, and saw membership triple as he 
fought to keep areas of the California desert 
open to off-roaders. Ed received Golden Hel-
met Award from the Off-Highway Motor Vehi-
cle Division of California’s Department of 
Parks and Recreation, CORVA’s Off-Roader 
of the Year award, and the Bureau of Land 
Management’s Volunteer of the Year Award. 
However, Ed was probably best known for his 
work as founder of the nonprofit Friends of 
Jawbone, which promotes better riding in the 
Jawbone Canyon OHV area. 
Ed Waldheim’s dedication to our public 
lands was unrivaled, and his spirit will live on

IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND 
JESSE L. JACKSON 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, 
Sr. for his lifelong commitment to the better-
ment of society. His contributions to our com-
munity are worthy of commendation. 
As an undergraduate, Rev. Jackson became 
involved in the civil rights movement. In 1965, 
he went to Selma, Alabama to march with Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. and became a worker 
in King’s Southern Christian Leadership Con-
ference. On April 4, 1968, Jackson was in 
Memphis, Tennessee when the civil rights 
leader was assassinated and has been com-
mitted to furthering Dr. King’s mission ever 
since. Today, Rev. Jackson has established 
his own legacy and continues to be one of 
America’s foremost civil rights, religious, and 
political figures. He is a passionate activist 
committed to making the world a better place 
and has been hailed by many for his work in 
human and civil rights and non-violent social 
change. Rev. Jackson has received over forty 
honorary doctorate degrees and was awarded 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Presi-
dent Bill Clinton in 2000, to name a few of his 
numerous accolades. 
In 1971, Rev. Jackson founded Operation 
PUSH and later established the National Rain-
bow Coalition. In 1996, the two organizations 
merged to form Rainbow PUSH, a nonprofit 
organization dedicated to pursuing social jus-
tice, civil rights, and political activism. Over 
twenty years later, Rainbow PUSH continues 
to be a multi-racial, multi-issue, and progres-
sive international organization committed to 
fighting for social change. With a mission to 
protect, defend, and gain civil rights by pro-
moting economic and educational equality, 
Rainbow PUSH is a critical resource. The or-
ganization uplifts our community’s most vul-
nerable, helping to employ the unemployed, 
educate children, provide healthcare, and pro-
mote peace and justice around the globe. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Sr. His 
lifetime of dedicated service has made our 
world a better place and furthers the great leg-
acy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Like Dr. 
King, Rev. Jesse Jackson continues to inspire 
others to work toward freedom, social justice 
and equality.

the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 
Kevin oversaw a plethora of projects and man-
aged a sizable, dedicated team that ensured 
that public funds were judiciously and effi-
ciently employed. 
Kevin graduated from Nebraska Wesleyan 
University with degrees in biology and chem-
istry. Soon after, Kevin chose to serve his 
country as a U.S. Navy officer of which he de-
voted nine honorable years. Even after his 
service, Kevin dedicated more of his time 
working as a manager for the Naval Audit 
Service where he artfully juggled a multitude 
of assignments that ensured that our Navy 
was handling its programs effectively. How-
ever, Kevin could not stop there, he joined the 
EPA in 2008 where he provided his technical 
expertise and leveraged his skills in manage-
ment and oversight. While at the EPA, Kevin’s 
hard work earned him a top leadership posi-
tion as the Deputy Assistant Inspector Gen-
eral, then later to his current position as As-
sistant Inspector General. 
Kevin’s remarkable career is worthy of dis-
tinction and his retirement from the EPA is 
both a solemn, yet joyful moment. His passion 
for both public service and the environment, 
highlights the vibrant culture at the EPA. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask you to 
join me in recognizing Mr. Christensen on a 
job well done. On behalf of America’s First 
District, we say thank you.

LUNAR NEW YEAR 2020 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the cultural and historical signifi-
cance of Lunar New Year in 2020, the Year of 
the Rat. 
As you may know, Asian Americans are the 
fastest growing ethnic group in the United 
States. With the continued expansion of Asian 
diaspora, Lunar New Year is now observed by 
millions of Asian Americans and by many non- 
Asian Americans in the United States. This 
tradition that began in China more than 4,000 
years ago, is now widely celebrated across 
the world. 
Lunar New Year, often referred to as Spring 
Festival in various Asian countries, is cele-
brated with family reunions, community activi-
ties and cultural performances. This is tradi-
tionally a time to wish upon others good for-
tune, health, prosperity, and happiness. Begin-
ning on the second new moon following the 
winter solstice, or the first day of the new year 
according to the lunisolar calendar, Lunar New 
Year extends into the full moon 15 days later. 
According to the lunisolar calendar, the 15th 
day of the new year is called the Lantern Fes-
tival. This year, Lunar New Year officially be-
gins on January 25th. 
Lunar New Year is a special time for fami-
lies to come together and celebrate the occa-
sion, which is why, when I was a state legis-
lator, I proposed making Lunar New Year a 
New York City school holiday. I later worked 
with the mayor and successfully established 
Lunar New Year as an official school holiday 
for all public schools in the city, and this year 
marks the fifth anniversary of this tradition. 
Students, including my two boys, are now able 
to fully celebrate with their families on Lunar 
New Year without facing any consequences 
for missing school should the holiday fall on a 
school day. This designation recognizes and 
appreciates the important immigrant story of 
AAPIs. 
Additionally, as the first Asian American 
elected to Congress from New York, I am 
proud to introduce today a resolution to recog-
nize the significance of this holiday. I am also 
grateful to the 68 Representatives who are 
joining me in introducing this resolution to rec-
ognize the cultural and historical significance 
of the holiday in 2020. 
Madam Speaker, I believe Lunar New Year 
is not only about recognizing the many con-
tributions the Asian American community has 
made, and continues to make, but it is about 
honoring and acknowledging that our nation’s 
strength lies in its diversity. Happy Lunar New 
Year to everyone celebrating in my district in 
Queens and across the United States.

HONORING LYONS FILMER 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate Ms. Lyons Filmer on 
the occasion of her retirement as radio station 
KWMR’s long-standing program director. Ms. 
Filmer has been associated with KWMR, a 
nonprofit radio station located in Point Reyes, 
California, for nearly two decades and is a 
cherished and vital voice of the community. 
A native of San Francisco, Ms. Filmer is a 
graduate of Middlebury College in Vermont, 
where she studied sociology and worked on 
the college radio station. Upon graduation, she 
returned to the San Francisco Bay Area and 
worked as a volunteer programmer at KPFA in 
Berkeley. 
Ms. Filmer joined KWMR in 1999. She was 
quickly promoted to Program Manager as the 
station undertook technical upgrades, gained 
its FM broadcast license from the Federal 
Communications Commission, and expanded 
its reach and signal into other parts of West 
Marin. During her tenure at KWMR, she has 
featured countless local luminaries, activists, 
and artists on the station, and has ably hosted 
the 
local 
news 
segment 
Epicenter 
and 
KWMR’s on-air literacy program, Turning 
Pages. She was part of a leadership team that 
now finds KWMR on three different FM signals 
in Marin County, and a station whose signal 
can now be heard deep into Sonoma County. 
The station’s role as emergency-services bea-
con for the region has extended in recent 
years as the region has been beset by floods, 
fires, droughts, and earthquakes. 
In her capacity as Program Director, Ms. 
Filmer has trained numerous on-air hosts as 
part of the station’s mandate to be a commu-
nity resource for all. As a DJ, her confident 
and mellifluous voice sets the standard for a 
top-tier radio personality. Ms. Filmer can be 
heard, by turns, informing her audience about 
a local news event, reading from non-fiction 
books about nature, and celebrating a new 
album of contemporary music. Known around 
the KWMR offices for her good humor, atten-
tion to detail, and tenacious loyalty to her be-
loved KWMR, Ms. Filmer’s successful career 
may be most notable for her zeal for forging 
lasting connections in her community. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Lyons Filmer for her many years of incom-
parable leadership at KWMR. While Ms. 
Filmer is stepping down as Program Director, 
she has pledged to continue to be an on-air 
presence at the station. Her leadership will be 
missed, but I join with her many listeners who 
look forward to hearing from Ms. Filmer in her 
new role and wishing her well on her future 
endeavors.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
JONATHAN 
WOLMAN AS HE RECEIVES THE 
LET FREEDOM RING AWARD 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Jonathan Wolman’s distin-
guished life and career as he receives the 
Rainbow PUSH Let Freedom Ring Award. 
Wolman’s contributions to our community are 
worthy of commendation. 
Jonathan Wolman was the editor and pub-
lisher of The Detroit News for twelve years. 
Wolman’s years at The Detroit News capped 
a career spanning five decades serving in 
newsrooms from Denver to Washington, DC. 
Before serving as a top executive at The De-
troit News, Wolman previously worked as a re-
porter and as Washington bureau chief and 
executive editor at the Associated Press. 
Throughout his tenure, Wolman covered some 
of the biggest and most consequential stories 
of his time and was regarded as a compas-
sionate, effective, and dedicated leader. 
After a long battle with pancreatic cancer, 
Jonathan Wolman died on April 15, 2019 in 
Detroit. His passing is a loss for our entire 
community, but his legacy will be remembered 
for generations to come. Johnathan Wolman 
is—and will continue to be—recognized as 
one of the most outstanding and impactful 
journalists of the last century. He championed 
hard news coverage that was fair, transparent, 
and balanced and was instrumental in keeping 
the Detroit News among the best regional 
newspapers in the country. Beyond his work in 
journalism, Wolman applied his skills to lend 
support to civil rights issues, particularly the 
Fannie Lou Hammer’s voting rights campaign 
in Mississippi that compelled thousands of Af-
rican Americans to become registered voters. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the distinguished life of Jona-
than Wolman. Wolman embodied all the char-
acteristics of a dedicated journalist. He dem-
onstrated a profound commitment not only to 
fairness, accuracy, and objectivity, but to tack-
ling some of our nation’s most difficult ques-
tions regarding race and economic equality. 
His work provides a lasting example for what 
we should all endeavor to accomplish—to ef-
fect change, speak the truth, and not sit idly 
by.

OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, due to un-

IN APPRECIATION OF DR. DAVID 
PATE’S SERVICE TO IDAHO AND 
ST. LUKE’S HEALTH SYSTEM 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank Dr. David C. Pate for his service to 
the great state of Idaho as he retires from St. 
Luke’s Health System following a decade of 
achievement and success there. 
I’m proud to say one of the best health care 
systems in the United States is in my home 
state of Idaho, thanks in large part to Dr. 
Pate’s transformative leadership. Dr. Pate has 
served as president and CEO of St. Luke’s 
Health System for the past 10-plus years. 
When Dr. Pate came to St. Luke’s in 2009, 
he pledged to turn the health-care system into 
a national leader in quality. He has done ex-
actly that. Under his leadership, St. Luke’s has 
earned the distinction of being a Top 15 
Health System in the U.S. for six years in a 
row; it is one of only four in the entire nation 
to have achieved this objective level of excel-
lence, ranking it with the Mayo Clinic. 
His academic background is equally impres-
sive. Dr. Pate received his bachelor’s degree 
from Rice University, his medical degree from 
Baylor College of Medicine and his law degree 
cum laude from the University of Houston Law 
Center. He completed his residency training at 
Baylor College of Medicine and is board-cer-
tified in internal medicine. A physician and a 
lawyer, Dr. Pate has been a wealth of knowl-
edge regarding health-care policy and law and 
a sought-after speaker throughout his career. 
As noteworthy as Dr. Pate’s career and ac-
colades are, what has struck me the most 
about him is how he treats everyone he 
meets. He is an ethical, approachable and 
personable man, and his warm and genuine 
demeanor, coupled with his remarkable exper-
tise, has made him an inspiring leader to med-
ical professionals in Idaho and across the 
country. 
He has mentored many young professionals 
and mid-career executives, and gone out of 
his way to meet with and advise leaders and 
executives in health care, education and other 
industries. At St. Luke’s, Dr. Pate has been 
known to surprise hardworking employees with 
cards, gifts, pop-up pizza parties, and other 
gestures of appreciation and respect. He has 
touched the lives of nurses, physicians, sup-
port staff members, and patients. He has 
shaved his head to support children with pedi-
atric cancer, donned a pink mullet to bring 
awareness to breast cancer—and regularly, 
without fanfare, has given blood to support all 
those in need through the American Red 
Cross. 
In addition to his medical career, Dr. Pate is 
an author, lecturer, teacher, volunteer and ac-
tive member of various professional boards 
and committees. A father of two adult daugh-
ters and a proud grandfather, Dr. Pate and his 
wife, Lynette, call the Treasure Valley of Idaho 
home. 
I am proud to honor Dr. Pate for his service 
to health care in Idaho, and would like to con-
gratulate him on a well-deserved retirement.

HONORING DR. HILLIARD 
LAWRENCE LACKEY III 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
pubic servant, Dr. Hilliard Lawrence Lackey, 
III. 
Hilliard Lawrence Lackey, III, was born to 
the late Hilliard Lawrence, Jr. and Cora Lack-
ey on October 9, 1942. 
Dr. Lackey earned three degrees from Jack-
son State University: Bachelor of Arts in His-
tory and Political Science, Master of Science 
Degree in Education Administration/Super-
vision and an Education Specialist Degree in 
Educational Administration. Dr. Lackey also 
earned a Master of Arts in Historical Geog-
raphy at the University of Arkansas and a 
Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Higher Edu-
cation Administration at the University of Mis-
sissippi. 
Dr. Hilliard L. Lackey was an Assistant Pro-
fessor of History and Alumni President (2004 
to 2010) before he became Assistant to the 
Executive Vice President for External Affairs at 
Jackson State University (1967 to 2002). He 
also taught at LeMoyne-Owen College in 
Memphis in 2003 and 2004, and parts of 2005 
and 2006. 
Dr. Lackey’s talent and hobbies include: 
being a football referee and baseball umpire; 
a columnist for the Mississippi Link, St. Louis 
American, Clarksdale Press Register, and The 
Scoop; and a television program host for 
Scope and radio news director of the WMPR 
radio station. 
Dr. Lackey is married to the love of his life, 
former Lillian Troupe, a math teacher at Pow-
ell Middle School. They have four beautiful 
children: Dr. Katrina Lackey Davis, a Medical 
Doctor at the University of Tennessee Medical 
School; Hilliard L. Lackey, IV, a recipient of a 
bachelor’s degree from the University of Ar-
kansas; Tahirih Charryse Lackey, a Ph.D. can-
didate at Georgia Tech; and Darryl William 
Lackey, an undergraduate student at Jackson 
State University who retired from Jackson 
State in 2010. 
Dr. Lackey became a writer at an early age 
and published a book, ‘‘Marks, Martin and the 
Mule Train’’ in 1998 because there was no 
written information about the events of the 
Mule Train and the Poor People’s Campaign 
during 1968 from Marks, MS to Washington, 
D.C. 
Another major accomplishment is that Dr. 
Lackey was the First Black Park Ranger at 
Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Carlsbad, 
New Mexico during the summers of 1964, 
1965, 1966. 
Dr. Lackey felt it was his appointed duty to 
answer the call of President Lyndon Baines 
Johnson and help integrate the National Park 
Service. Although he was terrified as a young 
man being so far away from the cotton fields 
of Marks, his birthplace, he conquered his 
fear. 
Dr. Lackey survived three summers, mas-
tered his job and paved the way for others. 
One of his encouraging encounters was when 
a black custodian working at the site put down 
his broom and became a Park Ranger during 
the time of his last year working there. 
Dr. Lackey also an unpublished book about 
being the First Black Park Ranger at Carlsbad 
Caverns National Park, New Mexico. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Hilliard Lawrence Lack-
ey for his successes and accomplishments.

OF 
MAUREEN 
TAYLOR AS SHE RECEIVES THE 
LET FREEDOM RING AWARD 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Maureen Taylor’s distin-
guished career and honor her remarkable 
work as she receives the Rainbow PUSH Let 
Freedom Ring Award. Taylor’s contributions to 
our community are worthy of commendation. 
In 1983, Maureen Taylor received her Bach-
elor of Social Work from Marygrove College, 
where she was the distinguished valedictorian 
of her graduating class. After graduation, Tay-
lor quickly immersed herself in social causes 
and became a dedicated community activist 
for poor and low-income families. In 1993, 
Taylor became the State Chair of the Michigan 
Welfare Rights Organization, the union for 
public assistance recipients and low-income 
people and was elected Treasurer of the Na-
tional Welfare Rights Union in 1994. 
Maureen Taylor makes a difference in our 
community. She has worked with countless 
people, residents, and community organiza-
tions to stop water, gas, and electricity shut 
offs for thousands of low-income families. Be-
yond this, Taylor has testified on the local, 
state, and federal level about the plight of poor 
people and continues to work with administra-
tors and public officials to draft policies that 
protect poor and low-income families. Taylor’s 
work has a profound impact on our community 
and reflects many of the teachings of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. by selflessly giving a voice 
to those who are silenced, powerless, or sup-
pressed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Maureen Taylor. Taylor’s te-
nacity for change and commitment to improv-
ing the lives of our community’s most vulner-
able makes her a deserving recipient of the 
Let Freedom Ring Award. I am grateful for her 
impact on our community and wish her contin-
ued success in the years ahead.

CELEBRATING RALPH OWENS’ 30 
YEARS OF SERVICE AS MAYOR 
OF LAVONIA 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Mr. Ralph Owens for 
his retirement as Mayor of the City of Lavonia. 
Mayor Owens retired on December 31, 2019, 
after serving the people of Lavonia as Mayor 
for over 30 years. 
Since first being elected to the Lavonia City 
Council in 1987 and, two years later, being 
elected Mayor in 1989, Mayor Owens has 
dedicated over 30 years to serving the people 
of Lavonia. During his tenure as mayor, Mr. 
Owens oversaw dramatic changes to the city’s 
departments and emergency services. When 
Mayor Owens took office, the city’s police de-
partment had only six officers and two police 
cruisers at their disposal. His expansion of the 
city’s police department and their capabilities 
resulted in the construction of a new complex, 
hiring of an additional eight officers, and pro-
viding each officer with their own vehicle. 
Throughout his 30 years of service, Mr. 
Owens remained focused on Lavonia’s eco-
nomic and industrial growth. As chair of the 
Franklin County Industrial Building Authority, 
he worked to successfully bring new busi-
nesses to the community, such as the 
AutoZone Distribution Center and St. Mary’s 
Sacred Heart Hospital, who now employ hun-
dreds of people in and around the area. 
In 2012, Owens was honored for his leader-
ship by being named the Georgia Mountains 
Regional Commission’s (GMRC) Elected Offi-
cial of the Year Award. The GMRC focuses on 
advancing economic and administrative co-
operation amongst the various Northeast 
Georgia communities. As mayor of Lavonia, 
Mr. Owens made considerable efforts to do 
his part in representing the interests of the 
people of Lavonia. 
In addition to being named Georgia Moun-
tains Regional Commission’s Elected Official 
of the Year 2012, Mayor Owens was also re-
cently named Lavonia Chamber of Com-
merce’s Good Citizen of the Year and was 
honored with the Margaret Ayers Award for 
Civic Health. 
For over three decades, Mayor Owens has 
made great sacrifices to serve the people of 
Lavonia. I want to congratulate him and his 
wife, Judy, on his retirement. But most of all, 
I want to thank him for dedicating his life to 
the betterment of the people of Lavonia.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND 
OPENING OF MALEK AL-KABOB’S 
DEARBORN LOCATION 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the grand opening of Malek 
Al-Kabob in Dearborn. The restaurant is a be-
loved institution in our community and the 
opening of its new location is cause for cele-
bration. 
Malek Al-Kabob was founded by chefs Abu- 
Fahd and Abu-Snan whose culinary careers 
began at an early age. After growing up in the 
Republic of Yemen, both migrated separately 
to the United States seeking the American 
Dream. After beginning their careers in the 
food industry, the two met as sous chefs and 
developed a close friendship due to their 
shared backgrounds and love for Middle East-
ern cuisine. After working side by side for 
years, Abu-Fahd and Abu-Snan decided to 
open an enterprise of their own. In the years 
that followed, the two opened several res-
taurants that have quickly become favorites in 
the communities in which they operate. 
In January of 2006, Malek Al-Kabob first 
opened its doors in Taylor. The location be-
came a popular destination in the Downriver 
community and was quickly recognized as one 
of 
the 
best 
Middle 
Eastern 
restaurants 
throughout the entire Metro Detroit region. 
Today, I am proud to celebrate Malek Al- 
Kabob as it expands. The opening of its new 
location in Dearborn not only exemplifies the 
restaurants continued success, but is a testa-
ment to the hard work of its staff and the pride 
its chefs put in to each and every dish. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in recognizing the grand opening of 
Malek Al-Kabob’s Dearborn location. The ex-
pansion represents a big step forward for the 
restaurant and will offer our community a new 
opportunity to come together to celebrate Mid-
dle Eastern cuisine.

HONORING MICHAEL A. GATER 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Mr. Michael A. Gater, a native 
of Jackson, Mississippi. He is a proud 1984 
honors’ graduate of Jackson State University 
and holds a Bachelor’s degree in Business 
Management. 
In July 2019 Mr. Gater was named the Di-
rector of Human Resources for the Jackson

the governing entity for the Jackson-Medgar 
Wiley Evers International Airport (JAN) and 
Hawkins

Airport 
(HKS). He is responsible for managing and in-
tegrating broad, comprehensive human re-
source management programs and safety for 
the Authority at JAN and HKS. 
For over twenty-one years, Mr. Gater dedi-
cated his career to enhancing the manage-
ment of resources related to employees. Prior 
to joining the Jackson Municipal Airport Au-
thority, he served as the Regional Site Human 
Resources Manager at Faurecia Automotive 
Seating for its Madison and Cleveland, Mis-
sissippi plants. His experience spans several 
industries (Auto Manufacturing, Cable and En-
tertainment, Waste Services and Retailing),

RECOGNIZING THE 2020 MARCH 
FOR LIFE 
HON. F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR. 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Madam Speaker, I 
proudly recognize the 47th annual March for 
Life. 
I am incredibly proud of the thousands of 
Americans, especially those from Wisconsin, 
who have traveled to Washington this week to 
defend the sanctity of life and protect the 
rights of the unborn. Throughout my tenure in 
Congress, I have been a staunch advocate for 
pro-life issues and have always supported ef-
forts to preserve human life at every stage of 
development. As Chairman of the House Judi-
ciary Committee, I shepherded the partial-birth 
abortion ban through Congress. It was one of 
my greatest honors to watch President George 
W. Bush sign it into law. I have also fully sup-
ported every effort in Congress to stop feder-
ally funded abortions, both in the United 
States and abroad. 
I want to thank everyone who participated in 
this year’s march and am grateful for all who 
stand for the unborn, but were unable to make 
it to Washington. We still have much work 
ahead of us to advance pro-life protections 
and your voices must be heard.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF SOS COMMUNITY 
SERVICES 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 50th anniversary of 
SOS Community Services. 
SOS Community Services was founded on 
the campus of Eastern Michigan University in 
1970. Seeing a need for drug-related crisis 
intervention in Washtenaw County, student 
and faculty volunteers came together to estab-
lish the organization to offer food, shelter, and 
emergency services to their struggling neigh-
bors and peers. As the organization grew, 
SOS Community Services began to take a 
more central role in directing services toward 
families and individuals with housing hard-
ships, establishing numerous assistance pro-
grams and opening several shelters to help 
people in need. 
Half a century later, SOS Community Serv-
ices continues to be an important resource for 
many in the Washtenaw County community. 
Every year, SOS provides assistance and 
housing services to nearly 7,000 people and 
particularly strives to help parents become 
self-sufficient by connecting them with employ-
ment opportunities, local resources, and stable 
housing options. Through their comprehensive 
work in Washtenaw County, SOS Community 
Services has improved our community and 
transformed thousands of lives. Their critical 
services enable people to regain hope, con-
fidence, and dignity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the 50th anniversary 
of SOS Community Services. For five dec-
ades, SOS Community Services has been a 
valuable resource to many in Washtenaw 
County. The organization’s commitment to our 
community sets an example we all should 
strive to emulate.

HONORING EDWARD ‘‘BOONE’’ 
GREEN 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Edward ‘‘Boone’’ Green, 
who passed away on September 30, 2019, at 
the age of 74 after a lifetime of exemplary 
service to his community. 
Born in 1945 in Monroe, Louisiana, Mr. 
Green’s family migrated to California in search 
of well-paying factory jobs and settled in Marin 
City when he was ten years old. His parents 
found employment with Marinship Corporation. 
As a young man, Mr. Green attended 
Tamalpais High School, and he developed 
what became a lifelong passion for boxing. 
In 1989, he became a boxing coach and es-
tablished the only boxing club in Marin City. 
The Marin Boxing Club quickly grew from a 
small outdoor training program into a full-scale 
training facility at the Marin City Recreation 
Center. He also established the non-profit One 
Kid at a Time. Mr. Green used boxing as vehi-
cle to teach important life skills, including 
health and nutrition and the importance of a 
strong work ethic. Eventually, Mr. Green went 
on to teach fitness and boxing classes for 
adults at College of Marin. 
Mr. Green was known as a tough coach, al-
ways expecting the best from his fighters, and 
he was regarded for his kindness and gen-
erosity. Mr. Green discreetly offered financial 
assistance to single mothers throughout the 
community and opened his home to young 
men in need of support. 
Mr. Green was a well-respected member of 
the community who will be remembered for his 
generous spirit, passion for boxing, and com-
mitment to religion. He is survived by his wife 
Ida Green, his children Apollo and Grace 
Green, a grandson, as well as his large ex-
tended family. While he will be greatly missed, 
Mr. Green’s legacy will live on through the in-
delible positive impact he had on his many 
friends, family, and the community at large.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
CONGRESS-
MAN JOHN CONYERS, JR. AS HE 
RECEIVES THE LEGACY AWARD 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Congressman John Conyers’ 
distinguished life as he receives the inaugural 
Legacy Award from Rainbow PUSH. After a 
remarkable 
political 
career, 
Congressman 
Conyers died on October 27, 2019. His pass-
ing is a loss for our entire community, but his 
legacy will be remembered for generations to 
come. 
John James Conyers, Jr. was born in De-
troit on May 16, 1929. After enlisting in the 
army in 1950 and serving in Korea as a sec-
ond lieutenant, Conyers returned home to 
Michigan and enrolled in Wayne State Univer-
sity, where he earned his bachelor’s degree in 
1957 and a law degree in 1958. Upon gradua-
tion, Conyers began his political career as a 
legislative aide to Representative John D. Din-
gell, Jr. and continued working in state gov-
ernment and as a lawyer until running for Con-
gress himself. 
Representative John Conyers, Jr. was the 
longest-serving African American in the history 
of Congress. Elected in 1964, Conyers rep-
resented Michigan in Congress for more than 
five decades. Throughout his tenure, Conyers 
was a fierce champion for civil rights, social 
justice, and economic equality. Conyers was 
an outspoken leader who took strong stands 
on some of our nation’s most challenging 
issues. Days after the assassination of Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Conyers became the 
leading voice in the fight to enshrine Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday as a national hol-
iday. On April 8, 1968, Conyers first intro-
duced the legislation, but the bill stalled. Yet, 
thanks to Conyers’ unrelenting persistence 
and painstaking efforts to recognize the civil 
rights icon, Congress passed the bill nearly 
twenty years later. On November 3, 1983, 
President Ronald Reagan signed the bill, for-
mally designating the third Monday of January 
as Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Congressman John 
Conyers. Conyers will forever be remembered 
as a trailblazer on issues of equality, civil 
rights, and social justice. He passionately 
worked to make his Michigan community a 
better place, and his legacy provides a lasting 
example of what we all should strive to ac-
complish.

HONORING FIRE CHIEF TROY S. 
JACKSON 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the memory of a fallen Colorado hero. 
On December 16, our community mourned the 
passing of South Metro Fire Rescue’s Oper-
ations Chief Troy Jackson. In 2013, Chief 
Jackson was diagnosed with a rare, job-re-
lated terminal cancer which ultimately took his 
life. Despite the physical and emotional chal-
lenges of his illness, Chief Jackson triumphed 
as a phenomenal leader and mentor during 
his battle with cancer. 
Chief Jackson began his professional fire-
fighting career in 1990. In his three-decade 
career he rose through the ranks, ultimately 
reaching the rank of Assistant Chief. Through-
out his career, Chief Jackson excelled at each 
level he served. His passion for training and 
safety is evidenced by his numerous awards 
and commendations for exceptional service. 
Chief Jackson worked diligently to help for-
ever change the culture of South Metro Fire 
and the American fire service. Jackson was a 
pioneer in reducing exposure and protecting 
firefighters. Specifically, Jackson initiated pol-
icy changes and equipment upgrades to pro-
mote aggressive firefighter decontamination 
following fires—and these policies have since 
spread across the United States. His pro-
grams, leadership, and vision help keep other 
firefighters from suffering from health problems 
like the one that took his life. There’s no doubt 
that Chief Jackson’s legacy lives on in our 
community, the fire service, and our country. 
His passion to protect and improve the health 
and safety of our emergency responders is of 
the greatest testament to his selfless leader-
ship. 
Chief Jackson leaves behind his supportive 
family including his loving wife, Lori, and chil-
dren Covey and Carley. Along with the entire 
South Metro Fire Family, they mourn our loss 
and commit to continuing his legacy. I am 
honored to recognize this American Hero in 
this chamber, the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. 
It is impossible to count the number of lives 
Chief Jackson touched as a firefighter, but we

94TH ANNIVERSARY OF JEWISH 
NATIONAL FUND-USA 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, on Jan-
uary 26, 1926, Jewish National Fund was es-
tablished in the United States, starting a 
uniquely American effort to support non-profit 
development in Israel. Its six action areas in-
clude ecology and afforestation; water; com-
munity development; research and develop-
ment; tourism and recreation; and education. 
Jewish National Fund-USA remains the old-
est tree-planting organization in the world, and 
February 10, 2020, marks the Jewish Festival 
of Tu BiShvat, the New Year for trees. 
The Jewish National Fund has planted over 
250 million trees that cleanse the air and pro-
vide a habitat for birds and other wildlife. 
Israel is the only country in the world that has 
a higher number of trees in the 21st century 
than in the previous century. 
Today, we pay tribute to Jewish National 
Fund-USA, an organization that brings the 
United States and Israel closer together. I 
commend the organization’s lay leadership 
and partners on this 94th anniversary, who 
continue to work tirelessly to make this earth 
a better place.

HONORING MR. MICHAEL ANTHONY 
MARTIN 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Michael Anthony Martin, 
a Weslaco, Texas native who became a na-
tional champion on Monday, January 13, 
2020, as a member of Louisiana State Univer-
sity’s National Championship football team. 
Martin, a freshman wide receiver for the 
LSU Tigers helped his team beat the Clemson 
Tigers with a final score of 42–25 to claim the 
College Football National Championship at the 
Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, 
Louisiana. The game was an exhilarating bat-
tle that went back and forth between the two 
teams until LSU pulled away in the second 
half. 
Michael Martin is the son of Randy and Mari 
Fuentes-Martin who raised their three children 
in the Rio Grande Valley. before moving to 
Louisiana. There Michael joined the LSU Tiger 
football team as a walk-on in 2018 and was 
redshirted his true freshman year. Prior to Mi-
chael’s first year with the LSU Tigers, he 
played his senior season at the University 
Laboratory School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 
where he was a standout baseball and football 
player. Michael transferred to University Lab-
oratory from Weslaco High School after his 
junior year, where he grew up learning the ins 
and outs of the sport. 
While attending University Laboratory as a 
senior, Michael lead his team to a perfect 13– 
0 record, which helped them to capture the 
2017 Louisiana Division-II State Champion-
ship. During the state title game against De La 
Salle High School, Michael returned a 54-yard 
punt for a touchdown, helping University Lab-
oratory clinch the state championship against 
De La Salle. Throughout the 2017 football 
season at University Laboratory, Michael 
scored four touchdowns for the team and led 
the team with four interceptions. 
I know that Michael is just getting his life 
going, but I want to pause and honor the ac-
complishments he has reached at such a 
young age. I look forward to what is ahead for 
him, both on and off the field. I wish him the 
best of luck as he continues his studies and 
football career at LSU, and I know that he will 
continue to make our community in the Rio 
Grande Valley proud. 
I thank his family for instilling in him the val-
ues and morals needed to be a National Foot-
ball Champion and know they have been sup-
portive of him since birth. 
Today, it is with great honor, admiration, 
and respect that I recognize the achievements 
of a young outstanding individual, Michael An-
thony Martin, who is now a Division I college 
football champion.

HONORING DEJUAN WATTS, SR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 24, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. DeJuan 
Watts, Sr., a remarkable individual with phe-
nomenal communal involvement impacting the 
lives of others through service and outreach in 
the community. 
As a lifelong resident of the Mississippi 
Delta, Dejuan Watts, Sr. exemplifies the nec-
essary intangible characteristics of persever-
ance, selflessness, integrity, and resilience. 
While every human should exemplify these 
qualities, there are certain individuals who 
epitomize those assets and adopt standards 
far beyond those as essential peculiarities. It 
takes special mentorship and unwavering 
commitment to become one of those individ-
uals. Dejuan Watts, Sr. embeds this into indi-
viduals who have been heartened by his nu-
merous services positively affecting commu-
nities, careers, and ultimately lives. 
Mr. Watts has proven to be a socially and 
academically incisive individual. A graduate of 
Quitman County High School, COGIC Semi-
nary, and a current student of Liberty Univer-
sity working untiring hours within our commu-
nities and beyond, he continually expresses 
adoration for being involved in encouraging 
the well-being of others. Though willingly help-
ing each person possible is important, he has 
a partiality for helping young men. Over the 
last 30 years, Mr. Watts has worked alongside 
Boyz to Men Mentoring, Youth Opportunities 
Unlimited, Quitman County School District, 
Quitman County Development Organization, 
M. S. Palmer Performing Arts, and most re-
cently Tougaloo College’s Delta Health Part-
ners Healthy Start Initiative. Through the latter 
mentioned, Mr. Watts utilizes social work serv-
ices aimed to empower and encourage young 
men to be present and active fathers to grow 
and sustain healthy family relationships. Com-
pleting countless hours of community service 
and volunteerism he continually seeks oppor-
tunities to serve, illustrating his work ethic, 
generosity, and leadership. 
Dejuan Watts whole heartedly shows the 
importance of family in the community: as hus-
band of Pearl Gordon Watts; father of two 
sons: Dejuan, Jr. and Torian Watts; two 
daughters in love: Nakisha and Jalisa Watts; 
and two very special grandchildren: Harlem 
and Kingston. He also serves as clergy in the 
community, appointed by the Northern Mis-
sissippi Jurisdiction Presiding Bishop and as 
Pastor of Rose Chapel Church of God In 
Christ in Crenshaw, MS. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. DeJuan Watts, Sr. as 
an unwittingly committed member of our com-
munity. Given his devotion to continual im-
provement of youth, health, and wellness 
DeJuan Watts, Sr. upholds moral and ethical 
standards of remarkable caliber.
