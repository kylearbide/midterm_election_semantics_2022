NEED FOR ACTIVE FOREST 
MANAGEMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, President Trump came to Cali-
fornia to be briefed on the horrific fires 
now raging in that State. Instead, he 
got a lecture from Governor Newsom 
and his staff on climate change. 
Well, if Gavin Newsom actually be-
lieves that if we all just ride our bikes 
to work and set our thermostats to 80 
degrees that these wildfires will go 
away, then he is completely delusional. 
Excess timber comes out of the forest 
in only two ways: It is either carried 
out or it burns out. For most of the 
20th century, we carried it out. It is 
called logging. 
Every year, the U.S. Forest Service 
foresters would mark off excess timber, 
and then we auctioned it off to lumber 
companies that paid us to remove it, 
funding both local communities and 
the forest service. We auctioned graz-
ing contracts on our grasslands. The 
result was healthy forests, fewer fires, 
and a thriving economy. 
But beginning in the 1970s, we began 
imposing environmental laws that have 
made the management of our lands all 
but impossible. Draconian restrictions 
on logging, grazing, prescriptive burn-
ing, and herbicide use on public lands 
have made modern land management 
endlessly time consuming and, ulti-
mately, cost prohibitive. A single tree 
thinning plan typically requires 4 years 
and more than 800 pages of analysis. 
The costs of this process exceed the 
value of timber, turning land mainte-
nance from a revenue-generating activ-
ity to a revenue-consuming one. 
Since 1980, these laws have produced 
an 80 percent decline in timber har-
vested off of the Federal forests and a 
concomitant increase in acreage de-
stroyed by fire. In California, the num-
ber of sawmills has declined from 149 to 
just 27. 
Now, these laws were passed with the 
promise they would improve the for-
ests. Well, after more than four dec-
ades, I think we are entitled to ask: 
How are the forests doing? 
An untended forest is just like an 
untended garden. It will grow and grow 
until it chokes itself to death. In a 
morbidly overcrowded State, stressed 
trees fall victim to disease, pestilence, 
drought, and, ultimately, catastrophic 
wildfire. In many regions of the Sierra, 
timber density is now four times great-
er than the land can support. 
We have been trying for years to re-
form these laws, resume active forest 
management, and restore our forests to 
health; yet the environmental leftists 
have blocked us every year. Instead, 
politicians use the excuse of climate 
change. 
Really? These environmental laws 
generally apply only to public lands. 
Today, you can easily tell the bound-
aries between private and public lands 
solely on the condition of the forests. 
How clever of the climate only to deci-
mate the public lands. 
The climate has changed much over 
the centuries, but the problem has not. 
When Juan Cabrillo dropped anchor in 
Santa Monica Bay in October of 1542, 
the height of the Santa Ana fire sea-
son, he named it the Bay of Smoke. Be-
fore western civilization, paleontolo-
gists tell us that we lost between 4 and 
12 million acres a year to wildfire in 
California. 
Modern forests and land management 
brought that destruction down to just 
a quarter of a million acres during the 
20th century. That annual destruction 
is now back up to 3 million acres a 
year. 
That is not a new normal; that is the 
old normal reasserting itself. That is 
not climate change; that is how nature 
deals with overgrown lands. And once 
destroyed, it can take centuries for our 
forests to regrow. 
We began active forest management 
to break that cycle. We decided we 
wanted every generation to enjoy our 
forests. So we introduced scientific for-
est management to do a little gar-
dening and keep our forests healthy by 
suppressing brush and harvesting ex-
cess timber so it couldn’t crowd itself 
to death. And it worked, until the envi-
ronmental laws abandoned science for 
ideology.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4720 
September 23, 2020 
The planet has been warming and 
cooling for millennia. Warmer tem-
peratures make it all the more impor-
tant to match tree density to the abil-
ity of the land to support it. That 
means more logging, not less. 
California has taken draconian meas-
ures to reduce carbon dioxide emis-
sions, at a terrible cost for the quality 
of life of Californians. We now suffer 
some of the highest costs for energy in 
the country; we have destroyed our 
manufacturing base; and we can’t guar-
antee enough electricity to keep our 
refrigerators running. Yet a single cat-
astrophic fire makes a mockery of all 
of these laws and the sacrifices they 
impose on our people. 
Governor Newsom says he has no pa-
tience for such views. Well, that is a 
tragedy for all Californians and for all 
of California’s forests.

IN 
SUPPORT 
OF 
THE 
VETERAN 
HIGH 
ALTITUDE 
AND 
SUICIDE 
RESEARCH ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MCADAMS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on the VA High Alti-
tude and Suicide Research Act. I intro-
duced this bipartisan bill to combat a 
very serious threat to our veteran pop-
ulation. 
After serving and protecting our 
country, our veterans return home 
only to face new threats. Studies show 
that veteran suicide is one-and-a-half 
times higher than nonveteran suicides. 
We must do everything we can to un-
derstand why our Nation’s heroes are 
taking their own lives, and we must do 
more to prevent more tragic deaths. 
In talking with suicide prevention 
experts in my home State of Utah, I 
am told that we need to better under-
stand the possible connection between 
high altitude and suicide. That is what 
my bill does. 
The VA High Altitude and Suicide 
Research Act compels the VA to study 
the link between veteran suicide and 
high altitude. It also requires the VA 
to establish effective treatment plans 
that respond to the threats and to save 
lives. 
As a nation, we have a responsibility 
to prevent future tragedies and provide 
these servicemembers with the care 
that they so desperately deserve. 
I thank the House for taking up this 
important legislation, and I urge adop-
tion. 
SUPPORT FOR A SUSTAINABLE, CLEAN ENERGY 
ECONOMY 
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of two of my 
bills included in the Clean Economy 
and Jobs Innovation Act. This legisla-
tive package takes bold and important 
steps toward a sustainable, clean en-
ergy economy. It is not only good for 
our health and for our environment, 
but it is good for our economy. 
I am particularly pleased to see my 
legislation included in the package, the 
Solar Energy Research and Develop-
ment Act. This bill authorizes solar en-
ergy research, development, and de-
ployment within the Department of 
Energy. 
Utah is a national leader in solar 
technology and is projected to produce 
over 1,000 megawatts of solar power in 
the next 5 years. My bill addresses the 
very serious threat of climate change, 
while supporting clean energy jobs. 
I am also pleased to see my air qual-
ity bill included. The Background 
Ozone Research Study Act directs the 
EPA and the National Academies of 
Science to study the sources of back-
ground ozone pollution and to provide 
actionable steps for cleaning our air. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill supports our 
clean energy economy and addresses 
our very serious need to address the 
climate crisis. 
IN SUPPORT OF THE FAITH IN CONGRESS ACT 
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the FAITH in Congress Act. 
This bipartisan legislation, introduced 
by my colleague STEPHANIE MURPHY, 
seeks to restore trust and faith in Con-
gress as an institution. 
As I travel throughout my district 
and talk with Utahns, there is a com-
mon theme that I hear from people of 
all political walks. That is that our po-
litical system is broken, and we need 
to change the way Washington does 
business. So this bill takes common-
sense, concrete steps to restore that 
faith through five central pillars: 
No automatic pay increases for Mem-
bers of Congress, which I have fought 
against since I was first sworn in; 
No budget, no pay; 
No first-class Member travel at tax-
payer expense; 
A lifetime ban on lobbying by former 
Members of Congress; and 
Prioritizing bipartisan bills over par-
tisan bills. 
That is it. Five simple steps that we 
should all be able to rally behind. 
Mr. Speaker, this is common sense, 
and I urge the House to take up and 
pass this legislation without delay.

HONORING 
STAFF 
ASSISTANTS, 
LEGISLATIVE CORRESPONDENTS, 
AND LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to thank those young men and 
women who have served the people of 
Illinois and the country as staff assist-
ants, legislative correspondents, and 
legislative assistants. 
I include in the RECORD a list of their 
names. 
Blanford,

(Anderson); Risolute, Scott; Sarley, Chris; 
Schonert, Neil; Tvrdy, Joe; Uram, Steve; 
Wolf, Saralyn (Tucker); Youssefiani, Darius. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, staff as-
sistants are the first person a visitor 
sees or hears in my D.C. office. First 
impressions are lasting impressions, so 
even though they are the lowest on the 
totem pole, they are very important. 
Staff 
assistants 
welcome 
visitors 
from the district. They help direct 
them and, many times, conduct tours 
of the Capitol. They help constituents 
with hotel information and lists of 
other tourist venues. 
Flags flown over the Capitol are 
highly sought after. These flags are re-
quested 
for 
memorial 
events 
and 
thank-yous. Many times they are need-
ed in a timely manner and, most times, 
have a specific date that the flag 
should be flown. Staff assistants ensure 
that this is done. 
The tough part of the job is answer-
ing the phones. Sometimes these calls 
are overwhelming and will get rolled to 
another staff member. Many times the 
callers are just plain mean and nasty. 
Just like in baseball, if the caller says 
the magic words, they are gone. There 
is no need to put my staff in that posi-
tion. It is sad that adults act this way 
and young adults have to put up with 
it. 
The next position in my office is the 
legislative 
correspondent. 
For 
me, 
these folks are concerned with writing 
and mailing letters in response to in-
quiries. Since I do not do bulk mail-
ings, this job is even more important in 
that individual letters received by my 
office receive an individual response by 
me. Most of the time, I have constitu-
ents thanking me for responding. Very 
few times did we drop the ball, and if 
we did, I would circle back with my 
staff and we would get a letter out. 
The legislative correspondent has the 
legislative assistant’s help with the 
letter, which will be reviewed by my 
legislative director and the chief of 
staff. The legislative correspondent 
gets an idea of the width and the 
breadth and the depth of policy issues 
that constituents are concerned with. 
It is a great place to start. 
Sometimes, on a very contentious 
issue, I will draft the letter myself. 
These letters have to come from the 
heart. 
Legislative correspondents usually 
move to the legislative assistant posi-
tion. Legislative assistants start spe-
cializing in specific policy areas. They 
may have some background in these 
areas, or they can be totally foreign to 
them. This is where a college degree 
based upon research, analysis, and 
writing pays off. 
As a member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, my subcommittees 
have to be covered. But it is not un-
common for staff members to carry a 
diversified portfolio of issues that they 
have to follow.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4721 
September 23, 2020 
Can you imagine having to follow the 
evolving world of energy issues while 
also being responsible for education, 
veteran affairs, and foreign policy? 
This is a smaller example of the larger 
issues Members have to be on top of 
every day. The only way we can do that 
is with the help of our legislative as-
sistants, and for that, I thank them. 
From this position, some have con-
tinued to become legislative directors, 
work on a committee, become chief of 
staff, work in the private sector, or re-
turn home to start other careers. Some 
may even find their way back to D.C. 
as a Member of Congress. This does 
happen. 
What a great benefit to have these 
young men and women sacrifice their 
time to serve the country. It is stress-
ful; there are long hours; their com-
pensation is limited, especially consid-
ering the high cost of living in D.C. 
Whenever they leave this place, they 
will have an appreciation that gov-
erning is difficult and that most Mem-
bers come to D.C. with a real desire to 
serve, just as they did. They have my 
thanks.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF 
WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in support of H.R. 
1923, the Women’s History and Nine-
teenth Amendment Centennial Quarter 
Dollar Coin Program Act. This bill will 
celebrate 100 years of women’s suffrage 
by 
featuring 
women 
leaders 
from 
across the country on quarter dollar 
coins. 
We have been working to advance 
this bill for over 3 years, and I am so 
proud to have the endorsement of var-
ious stakeholders and the support of 
the United States Mint and Treasury 
on this legislation. 
Let me first thank my co-lead, Con-
gressman ANTHONY GONZALEZ, as well 
as our Senate counterparts, Senators 
CATHERINE
CORTEZ
MASTO
and DEB 
FISCHER, for their efforts, and for all of 
our staff for working diligently on this 
legislation. 
And I thank my good friend Con-
gresswoman MAXINE WATERS and the 
Financial Services Committee for their 
leadership and commitment to getting 
this bill to the floor. There is bipar-
tisan and bicameral support for this 
legislation. 
My 
good 
friend, 
Congresswoman 
BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN’s legislation 
on 
semiquincentennial 
coins 
com-
memorating the 250th anniversary of 
the United States is included in this 
coin package, and I thank her for 
spearheading the efforts on that initia-
tive. 
Finally, let me thank my dear friend, 
former U.S. Treasurer, Rosie Rios, who 
was really instrumental in shaping this 
legislation years ago, and for her in-
credible work to raise the visibility of 
women in every space and place to re-
inforce the critical role women have 
played and continue to play in history. 
I am deeply grateful for her leadership. 
Finally, let me just specifically ac-
knowledge my staff, my former legisla-
tive director, Emma Mehrabi, for early 
on never missing a beat with diligence 
and strategic work in getting this bill 
to the floor, and also my current legis-
lative director, Gregory Adams, who 
really has taken this bill to the finish 
line. 
H.R. 1923 will create a new series of 
circulating quarters, starting in 2022, 
featuring trailblazing women in Amer-
ican history. It is my hope that women 
of all backgrounds, diverse American 
women, will be chosen and depicted, 
celebrating the accomplishments of 
our Nation’s historical leaders, think-
ers, 
innovators, 
activists, 
freedom 
fighters, women who have contributed 
to achievements in many, many fields: 
civil 
rights, 
abolition, 
suffrage, 
science, and technology, the arts and 
humanities, 
education. 
Because 
of 
these women our country is better for 
them and their leadership. 
Much like the previous and cele-
brated 50 State Quarters program, the 
women featured on these coins and 
their images will be selected with 
broad public input. Each Governor will 
engage with members of the general 
public and local groups focused on in-
creasing the inclusion of women or im-
proving the quality of life for women to 
recommend a prominent, trailblazing 
woman to represent their State or ter-
ritory to be featured on their State 
coin. 
It is my hope that through this proc-
ess the broader American public can 
engage in a dialogue and celebration of 
the contributions of these women, en-
suring that their legacy and contribu-
tions are more widely known, under-
stood, and valued in each and every 
corner of our country. 
Mr. Speaker, driving to the Capitol 
this morning, traffic was stopped at 
the corner. I saw the hearse carrying 
the casket of our beloved Justice Gins-
burg to the Supreme Court. I said a 
prayer as I witnessed the procession, 
and thought about her life and how she 
paved the way for racial and gender 
equality, and I thought about it in the 
context of this bill today, and the phe-
nomenal women who this country will 
have a chance to get to know. I thank 
her for her life, her legacy, and for 
what she has done to ensure that 
women now have their rightful place in 
history. 
f 
RECOGNIZING BRAIN ANEURYSM 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Brain Aneu-
rysm Month, the time when we spread 
awareness of the signs and symptoms 
and seek increased research into treat-
ment and prevention. 
This month has a very special con-
nection to northeast Florida that I 
would like to take just a moment to 
share. 
Trinity Love Hoblit was born with a 
rare form of primordial dwarfism and 
grew to be only 29 inches tall. Despite 
her small size, the love and joy she 
brought into this world was larger than 
life. Throughout her life, she battled 
brain aneurysms and underwent nu-
merous surgeries to help alleviate the 
symptoms. 
Sadly, on June 30, 2015, Trinity 
passed away. She was only 14 years of 
age. 
To continue her life legacy, her par-
ents, Olivia and Phil Hoblit, estab-
lished the Trinity Love Hoblit Founda-
tion, headquartered in Amelia Island, 
Florida. Its purpose is to support and 
fund neurological research, training, 
and treatment for brain aneurysms, 
strokes, and other cerebrovascular con-
ditions at hospitals in northeast Flor-
ida and around the country. 
So in honor of Trinity and the foun-
dation in her name, please listen close-
ly to the risk factors and signs and 
symptoms of brain aneurysms. 
The risk factors include: Smoking, 
high blood pressure, older age, alcohol 
and/or drug abuse, and family history. 
The symptoms of a brain aneurysm 
include: Severe headache, pain above 
one eye or behind one eye, blurred or 
double vision, difficulty speaking or 
swallowing, numbness or weakness on 
one side of the body, and seizures. 
Please do not ignore these symptoms, 
and promptly seek medical care if you 
experience any of them, especially if 
you are having the worst headache of 
your life. When it comes to brain aneu-
rysms, awareness is the beginning of 
prevention and cure. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I offer my 
heartfelt thanks to Olivia and Phil 
Hoblit, the Trinity Love Hoblit Foun-
dation, their board of directors, and ad-
visory committee members for the 
lives they are helping to save every 
day. 
Through their important work, the 
loving memory of Trinity Love Hoblit 
will live on forever.

JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, and I rise today, Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the many persons 
who are peacefully protesting and de-
manding justice for Breonna Taylor; 
peacefully protesting and demanding 
justice. 
But I also rise, Mr. Speaker, for the 
many persons who may never protest, 
but believe that Breonna Taylor de-
serves justice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4722 
September 23, 2020 
I rise, Mr. Speaker, because my heart 
is heavy. It is difficult to comprehend 
some of the things that are happening 
in this country. It is expected that 
there will be some announcement in 
the near future as to the fate of the of-
ficers who were engaged in the no- 
knock intrusion; a no-knock intrusion. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you and 
the world what justice for Breonna 
Taylor would look like. Justice for 
Breonna Taylor would look the same as 
it would if Breonna Taylor were of a 
different hue. She was an African- 
American female. She was in her apart-
ment. She was not breaking the law. 
Justice for Breonna Taylor would 
look the same way it would look for 
Breonna Taylor if she was were a White 
woman; a White woman in her apart-
ment; a White woman not breaking the 
law; a White woman who had the police 
intrude into her home, as it were, with 
a no-knock warrant. This is what jus-
tice would look like for Breonna Tay-
lor. 
And at some point in this country we 
have to acknowledge that there is a 
perception that there is a system of 
justice that is not blind, a system of 
justice that sees the color. And when 
the color of the person is known, jus-
tice can sometimes turn a blind eye. 
So today I rise, and I demand justice 
for Breonna Taylor, the same justice 
that she would get if she were a dif-
ferent hue, in her home, 26 years old, 
committing no crime; the same justice. 
And, finally, if we continue to allow 
the perception to exist that injustice 
can be justified, it will not bode well 
for our country. 
I stand for peaceful protest, and I de-
nounce any form of protest other than 
peaceful protest. 
I demand justice for Breonna Taylor. 
f 
AGRICULTURAL SUMMIT FOR OUR 
FARMERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, during the August recess 
I had the pleasure of hosting one of my 
favorite annual events, an agriculture 
summit 
in 
Cresson, 
Pennsylvania, 
Cambria County. 
The event took place for the second 
year in a row at Mount Aloysius Col-
lege, and I was pleased to have several 
special guests join me, both in person 
and virtually. 
Participating in the summit to lend 
their expertise were: USDA Under Sec-
retary Bill Northey; Pennsylvania Sec-
retary of Agriculture Russell Redding; 
and Pennsylvania Farm Bureau Presi-
dent, Rick Ebert. 
Joining our discussion were nearly 
100 virtual attendees from across the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
Our discussion centered around a 
number of important policy issues im-
pacting our Nation’s farmers, including 
a discussion on what they hope to see 
in the next round of coronavirus relief. 
I always look for opportunities to en-
gage directly with farmers and ranch-
ers and producers and processors. This 
year’s agriculture summit provided 
valuable feedback about how the pan-
demic has affected rural America; feed-
back that will be critical as Congress 
continues to address the impacts of the 
pandemic on the agricultural sector. 
Prior to the coronavirus, the farm 
economy had been in a multiyear 
slump. Just as things were starting to 
look up, with USMCA signed into law 
and new trade deals in the works, this 
pandemic hit all of us hard, particu-
larly our farm families. 
I have heard a great deal of positive 
feedback across the board about the 
USDA 
Farmers 
to 
Families 
Food 
Boxes. Not only is this program pro-
viding fresh, nutritious foods to fami-
lies in need, it also is helping farmers 
sell crops that may otherwise go to 
waste. 
I have been impressed with the qual-
ity of the program, particularly with 
the oversight and efficiency. Thanks to 
the Farmers to Families Food Box Pro-
gram, more than 90 million boxes have 
been delivered to families in need. 
Another program that has been help-
ing our farmers is the Coronavirus 
Food Assistance Program, or CFAP. 
Now, I couldn’t believe it, but one of 
the farmers I met while back in my dis-
trict for August recess had not heard of 
the program and how it could help his 
family farm. 
I want to urge my colleagues, espe-
cially now that the second round of 
CFAP has been made available, to con-
tinue to spread the word about this 
valuable resource. 
While we have supported the agri-
culture industry in the previous COVID 
relief efforts, many of our farmers are 
wondering what is next. 
It is my hope that we put politics 
aside and finally come together on a bi-
partisan agreement that will support 
our hardworking essential employees 
in the agriculture industry, as well as 
our critical industries.

RECOGNIZING COACH TOM FLORES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
during Hispanic Heritage Month. We 
know that millions and millions of His-
panics for generations have made so 
many contributions to our country in 
every way of life. 
Today, I want to recognize the distin-
guished career of Coach Tom Flores, a 
trailblazer in the Latino community in 
the sport of professional football. 
A son of immigrants from Mexico, a 
native of my hometown, Fresno, Cali-
fornia, Coach Flores was a gifted high 
school and collegiate athlete and later 
made an indelible mark on professional 
football. 
Playing for the Oakland Raiders’ sil-
ver and black, Flores became the first 
Hispanic starting quarterback in the 
NFL. 
But his success didn’t stop there. 
After ending his playing career, he 
went on to Super Bowl XI as an assist-
ant coach for the Raiders. Whether 
they be the Oakland Raiders, the Los 
Angeles Raiders, or now the Las Vegas 
Raiders, we all know the silver and 
black, with a great deal of pride. 
Four years later, he led the team to 
victory as a head coach, becoming the 
first Hispanic head coach to win a 
Super Bowl. He did it twice. 
To this day, he is only one of two 
people in history to win multiple Super 
Bowls as a player, an assistant coach, 
and a head coach. 
Despite his success, he never forgot 
where he came from. That is Tom. 
We hope and pray the third time is a 
charm and that he will be inducted 
into the NFL’s Hall of Fame in Canton, 
Ohio. 
Since leaving professional football, 
Coach Flores has used his influence to 
bring educational opportunities to the 
valley home where he came from 
through the Tom Flores Youth Foun-
dation. 
He has raised nearly $2 million to 
support local school districts, science, 
art, and athletic programs. He never 
forgot where he came from. 
Before the pandemic, he was also 
scheduled to be an honored guest for 
Fresno’s annual FresYES Fest. 
Sadly, despite such a decorated ca-
reer, he was passed over for induction 
in the Professional Football Hall of 
Fame back in February. It was not the 
first time. 
In January, I introduced legislation 
calling for the recognition of his sig-
nificant achievements in the sport and 
for his induction into the Professional 
Football Hall of Fame. 
Recently, the Professional Football 
Hall of Fame Selection Committee an-
nounced Coach Flores as the single fi-
nalist in the 2021 class in a new coach 
category. This development is welcome 
news and opens the door for Coach Flo-
res to receive the overdue recognition 
he deserves. 
So, we recognize the important con-
tributions Hispanic Americans have 
made to our culture, to our commu-
nities, in every way of life in the 
United States. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Tom Flores resolution to honor the in-
valuable contribution he has made to 
his community, to our country, and to 
America’s game. It is time. 
HONORING JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the passing of Supreme Court 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, RBG. 
For all Americans, I believe Friday 
night was a sad evening as we learned 
the news. Justice Ginsburg truly made 
a difference, both during her tenure on 
the Court and through her long career. 
Justice Ginsburg inspired 
people. 
Justice Ginsburg inspired women. Jus-
tice Ginsburg inspired young women. 
Justice Ginsburg broke the glass ceil-
ing in so many different ways through

her fierce advocacy for women’s rights 
and civil justice. 
Justice Ginsburg’s keen ability to 
build bridges between conservatives 
and liberal Justices garnered the re-
spect of all jurists, regardless of their 
political 
philosophy, 
something 
we 
should take note of here in the people’s 
House of Representatives, that we 
bridge the gap between our political 
differences and remember that we are 
Americans first. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg always re-
minded us that we are Americans first 
and that equal justice under the law is 
always the credo of the American way. 
Justice Ginsburg served in so many 
ways for so many examples on how to 
balance the scales of justice. Our Na-
tion will mourn Justice Ginsburg’s loss 
and honor her legacy for generations to 
come, I truly believe, because she is a 
role model for all.

HONORING CARL NUNZIATO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. RYAN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak about H.R. 5023, which names 
the Department of Veterans Affairs 
community-based outpatient clinic in 
Youngstown, 
Ohio, 
as 
the 
Carl 
Nunziato VA Clinic. 
This bill was recommended to my of-
fice and strongly supported by leaders 
within my congressional district’s vet-
erans community because they rightly 
wish to honor one of their own for his 
exemplary service. I thank them and 
Chairman 
MARK
TAKANO, 
Ranking 
Member Dr. PHIL ROE, and their respec-
tive staffs for helping our office bring 
this bill to the floor, as well as my own 
staff, Zach Prager and Ivan De La Cruz 
Santiago. 
Today is a red-letter day, Mr. Speak-
er, in my book because in the midst of 
all that is going on nationally, all the 
controversies, Congress can still put its 
differences aside to take time and rec-
ognize a true American hero: Carl 
Nunziato. 
Carl was born in Youngstown, Ohio, 
in 1938, graduating from Rayen High 
School. After marrying his high school 
sweetheart, Clara, he would go on to 
attend college at Youngstown State 
University. 
Through the university’s Reserve Of-
ficer Training Corps program, Carl 
earned a commission as a second lieu-
tenant in the United States Army. It 
was with his heart filled with love and 
devotion to his family, his hometown, 
and his country that he set off for the 
battlefields of Vietnam. 
All those who served with Carl tes-
tify to his unmatched fighting spirit. If 
you ever found yourself in a foxhole 
with chaos all around you, Carl was the 
guy you wanted there with you because 
no matter what happened, you could be 
sure of one thing: Carl would never 
quit. Never. 
Life would test Carl in ways that 
most Americans can’t even imagine. 
On November 22, 1966, Carl lost both of 
his legs when an enemy mortar round 
impacted less than 3 feet away from 
him as he was running toward his 
unit’s command center. 
On that battlefield, and over the next 
2 years at home, Carl would fight for 
his life not far from where we stand 
today, at Walter Reed National Mili-
tary Medical Center. Carl may have 
walked out of that hospital on two 
prosthetic legs, but his resolve was 
more steadfast than before he walked 
in. 
Carl 
returned 
to 
his 
hometown, 
Youngstown, Ohio, enrolled in law 
school at Case Western Reserve, and 
with graduation began yet another bat-
tle: the fight for veterans and all 
Americans with disabilities. 
As an attorney utilizing a wheelchair 
in the 1970s, most of the courthouses he 
encountered lacked the accessibility 
that he and other Americans like him 
needed to be able to simply get his job 
done. 
Carl saw the problem and seized the 
initiative, as he had always done with 
obstacles he encountered in life. Carl 
created a committee to fight for vet-
erans with disabilities and became a 
relentless advocate on behalf of all of 
those with the same conditions. 
But Carl went even further. He estab-
lished a task force to improve veterans 
services in Youngstown at a time when 
the VA sent the city a single nurse 
once a week when the Mahoning Valley 
had 40,000 veterans. 
Carl wanted a VA clinic. VA said no. 
Carl didn’t take no for an answer. 
Carl’s efforts came to fruition in 1991 
when the VA finally established an 
outpatient clinic in Youngstown. 
Today, Carl continues to be a stellar 
citizen, not just for Youngstown, not 
just for the people of Ohio, not just for 
vets, not just for people with disabil-
ities, but for all Americans. 
Carl works tirelessly with the VA to 
continue improving the care received 
by veterans. Carl relentlessly pursues 
improving care and services for all 
Americans with disabilities. 
The naming of this clinic, Mr. Speak-
er, is a small measure in comparison to 
what he has accomplished on behalf of 
our country’s heroes and all of those 
with disabilities. 
Carl never quits—never has quit, 
never will quit. And I am humbled to 
have the privilege of representing an 
individual of this caliber in this Cham-
ber. 
I will say, finally, when other vets 
and citizens from our community look 
at Carl’s portrait hanging in this clinic 
and they see his name, they will know 
that things can get better. With effort, 
with grit, you can make a difference as 
long as you never quit, as long as you 
never take no for an answer.

States around our Nation. Send Your 
spirit of healing and well-being among 
those who suffer, and Your angels to 
protect the many healthcare workers 
who place their own well-being in dan-
ger every day. 
Comfort those today in the Supreme 
Court who begin the public mourning

Ginsburg. Console those many who 
worked with and near her over so many 
years.

medical conditions. Fifty-four million 
Americans could lose health insurance 
coverage without this important pa-
tient protection, including nearly 7 
million people stuck with COVID–19, 
the newest pre-existing condition. 
COVID–19 has killed 200,000 Ameri-
cans in less than 8 months, and 288,000 
new COVID–19 cases were diagnosed in 
the last 7 days alone. The United 
States has 5 percent of the world’s pop-
ulation and 25 percent of COVID–19 
cases because the White House’s re-
sponse to COVID–19 was slow, sloppy, 
and chaotic. Now that same White 
House wants to kill the only law that 
protects Americans from COVID–19, 
the newest pre-existing condition. 
We need a White House that protects 
American families and sides with the 
American people, keeping them and 
their families healthy and safe.

RECOGNIZING THE RIVET 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, I had 
the pleasure of touring the newest 
branch of the Centre County Discovery 
Space called The Rivet. 
The Rivet is a 5,000-square-foot com-
munity workshop that aims to connect 
people and ideas to create and inno-
vate. Members of the Centre County 
community can take advantage of open 
shop hours and classes that teach tech-
nical skills, critical thinking, and 
interactive learning. 
At The Rivet, individuals can learn 
how to use 3D printers, woodworking 
machines, a pottery studio, CAD soft-
ware, and the list goes on. America 
needs a qualified and skilled workforce. 
In Pennsylvania jobs in the trades 
have been growing at roughly 3 percent 
each year, but job seekers with the 
qualifications for these positions aren’t 
matching that growth. That is what we 
call ‘‘the skills gap.’’ 
I was encouraged by the work that 
The Rivet is doing by providing an out-
let for those who are seeking a career 
powered by career and technical edu-
cation. 
I want to thank Rivet manager 
Camille Sogin for her work to provide 
CTE opportunities in Centre County.

REMEMBERING GIANA HUTTON 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to remember Giana Hutton, 
one of my constituents and a pas-
sionate advocate for education and eq-
uity. She was a member of Alpha 
Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. 
Giana grew up in Flossmoor, Illinois, 
and 
attended 
Parker 
Junior 
High 
School and Homewood-Flossmoor High 
School. She obtained her BA in history 
from Williams College in 2010 at just 18 
years of age. Later, she completed a 
master’s of science in public policy and 
management from Carnegie Mellon 
University, one of our Nation’s most 
prestigious programs. 
Between her studies, she interned for 
Illinois Senator Roland Burris, sup-
porting staff working on education and 
judiciary policy. 
Most recently, she was working as a 
program analyst for the Office of the 
State Superintendent of Education in 
Washington, D.C. In this role, she di-
rectly supported the educational suc-
cess of District students by helping 
programs work better and be more ef-
fective. 
She had recently been accepted in 
the District’s Certified Public Manager 
Program Cohort at GW University. 
Giana is survived by her fiance, par-
ents, and sister. Giana will be greatly 
missed by all, especially the young 
people whose lives she positively im-
pacted through her work. 
As we remember her life and legacy, 
we must recommit to her passion: edu-
cational equity and the opportunity for 
every young American to receive a 
quality education. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE 40TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHRONICLE 
(Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 40th anniversary of 
the founding of The Chronicle, a week-
ly newspaper in my district. 
The Chronicle was established by 
Mark Frost in 1980 in Glens Falls, New 
York. Through hard work and deter-
mination, Mark turned an initial in-
vestment of $1,700 into a successful 
newspaper and small business. He re-
mains the publisher and editor today, 
alongside their team who have been 
with The Chronicle for decades. 
In that time, The Chronicle has es-
tablished a loyal base of readers and 
advertisers, becoming truly a corner-
stone of the community. 
The Chronicle has also hosted events 
to provide a forum for discussion and 
to bring Glens Falls residents together, 
especially through The Chronicle Book 
Fair. The fair is an opportunity to 
highlight and connect local authors 
and publishers and discover books of 
all genres. 
Annual events like this are impor-
tant to strengthen and grow the fabric 
of our communities, and I know many 
who are looking forward to safely re-
suming them as soon as possible. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District 
and the United States Congress, I 
would like to thank Mark Frost, his 
family, and the entire Chronicle team 
for their contributions to the commu-
nity and congratulate them on reach-
ing this important 40-year milestone. 
f 
PHILIPPINE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
WILD. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today, 
across 
the 
Philippines, 
Rodrigo 
Duterte’s brutal regime is using the 
pretext of a so-called anti-terrorism 
law to ramp up efforts targeting labor 
organizers, workers, and political oppo-
nents. This law allows suspects to be 
detained by the police or military 
without charges for as long as 24 days 
and placed under surveillance for up to 
90 days. 
In response to these abuses, I intro-
duced the Philippine Human Rights 
Act, which would block U.S. funding 
for police or military assistance to the 
Philippines—outlining a series of basic 
criteria which would have to be met in 
order to resume such funding. 
I am proud to stand alongside so 
many faith and civil society organiza-
tions in advocating for this legislation. 
And I am especially proud to stand 
with leaders of the U.S. labor move-
ment: the AFL–CIO, the SEIU, the 
Teamsters, the Communication Work-
ers of America. They understand that 
in fighting for their brothers and sis-
ters in the labor movement abroad, 
they are also helping safeguard their 
own rights and dignity here at home. 
Let us make clear that the United 
States will not participate in the re-
pression. Let us stand with the people 
of the Philippines. 
f 
HISTORIC ABRAHAM ACCORDS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the Post and Courier of 
Charleston on September 19 editorial-
ized ‘‘Good news at last from the Mid-
dle East.’’ 
‘‘A series of friendship treaties be-
tween Bahrain and the United Arab 
Emirates with Israel, midwifed by his 
(Trump’s) unorthodox Middle East dip-
lomatic team, provides constructive 
news from a region that sorely needs 
it.’’ 
‘‘With strong support from his first 
United 
Nations 
ambassador, 
Nikki 
Haley, Mr. Trump rejected his prede-
cessor’s 
ambiguous 
stance 
toward 
Israel and strongly supported the Jew-
ish nation. With worries increasing 
about Iranian aggression and power, 
some Arab nations began looking at 
Israel as a potential ally rather than 
an enemy.’’ 
‘‘But Mr. Trump has been construc-
tive in limiting Iranian interference in 
Iraq and promoting friendship between 
Israel and major Sunni Arab nations 
. . . he deserves credit for seizing the 
moment to take an important step to-
ward creating a more peaceful region.’’ 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

CONGRATULATIONS TO MIKE 
TOBIN 
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, my friend, Mike Tobin, is re-
tiring. 
Mike 
and 
I 
met 
through 
LifeQuest, which serves people with de-
velopmental disabilities. Mike has been 
on the board and he receives support 
from LifeQuest. 
Now, he is a Minnesota Twins and a 
Kansas Jayhawks fan, just like I am, 
but he serves as a role model to me. 
Mike has always been a hard worker, 
whether at Pizza Ranch or Elixir or 
anywhere else. He is a good person, al-
ways with a smile on his face, treating 
people warmly and with respect. 
He is honest. A few years ago, Mike 
found $300 in cash in an envelope on the 
street, and of course, he would turn it 
over to the police. 
So congratulations, Mike, on your 
65th birthday and on your retirement. 
Thank you for showing me and every-
one else how to properly live life.

RECOGNIZING CLEAN ENERGY 
WEEK 
(Mr. CURTIS asked and was given

Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of Clean Energy 
Week, an opportunity to celebrate bi-
partisan support for the wide variety of 
clean energy sources strengthening 
America’s national security while also 
preserving our environment for future 
generations. 
The environment is, and should be, a 
bipartisan issue. That is why I am 
proud to lead, with my friend Congress-
man LOWENTHAL of California, a bipar-
tisan resolution in support of Clean En-
ergy Week. 
In fact, my legislation was intro-
duced by 71 original cosponsors, divided 
almost evenly between Republicans 
and Democrats. This goes to show that 
we can and must work across the aisle 
to be better caretakers of our planet, 
and I plan to continue the pursuit of 
these positive bipartisan policies while 
in Congress.

WILDFIRES BURNING IN 
CALIFORNIA 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, fire sea-
son continues to rage on in California 
and in the West, and it continues to 
underline the need for us to have active 
management 
of 
our 
forests, 
our 
wildlands, our grasslands, everything 
to do with fire season and the increased 
fuel loads that we are seeing. 
We hear a lot of talk about climate 
change. Well, I keep coming back to, If 
the climate is changing, what are we 
doing about it? 
We can argue over whether it is man-
made climate change or nature caused, 
we are still allowing our forests, our 
grasslands, our wildlands to be over-
loaded with fuel, and that puts our 
towns, people’s livelihoods in great 
danger and great peril. 
I could list time after time the trage-
dies that we have seen in northern 
California with people losing their 
homes, portions of small towns, their 
livelihoods because we are not doing 
the job on our Federal lands, and we 
are not telling the environment groups 
to back off with their lawsuits that 
prevent the work from being done that 
so desperately needs to be done. 
We have to get cracking on this and 
get our job done here as Federal rep-
resentatives to help save our rural 
areas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4726 
September 23, 2020 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 1129, 
providing for consideration of three 
measures. 
First, the rule provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy 
Jobs and Innovation Act, under a 
structured rule. The rule provides 90 
minutes of debate equally divided 
among and controlled by the chairs and 
ranking minority members of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce and 
the Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology. The rule self-executes a 
manager’s amendment, makes in order 
98 amendments, and provides en bloc 
authority and one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 6270, the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Disclosure Act of 2020, under a 
closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Financial 
Services, and it provides one motion to 
recommit. 
Finally, the rule provides for the con-
sideration of H.R. 8319, the Continuing 
Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Ex-
tensions Act, under a closed rule. The 
rule provides for 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, the bills contained in 
this rule are about meeting our respon-
sibility here at home and living up to 
our values abroad. 
First is H.R. 8319, a continuing reso-
lution to keep our government funded 
through December 11. Fortunately, we 
won’t need to call this bill up because 
a compromise passed this House last 
night by a vote of 359–57. That is quite 
an accomplishment because sometimes 
we can’t even agree on what to have for 
lunch here, yet we were able to come 
together to keep this government open. 
That is good news for the American 
people. 
Second is H.R. 4447, a sweeping en-
ergy package that will help our Nation 
lead the world once more in clean en-
ergy. Investing in renewable energy 
like wind and solar won’t just help us 
combat the threat of climate change; 
they will help us create jobs here at 
home that can never be outsourced. 
It is especially important that we are 
considering this package right now. 
There are wildfires raging in places 
like California, Oregon, and Wash-
ington 
that 
are 
leaving 
a 
heart-
breaking path of destruction. Sci-
entists are unequivocal: These fires are 
just the latest indication that climate 
change is real and is happening right 
now. This is not some long-off threat 
that we can leave for our kids or 
grandkids. This is happening today. 
By addressing it, we won’t just pro-
tect our environment. We will create 
jobs at a time when our country badly 
needs 
them. 
Because 
of 
the 
coronavirus, our country is facing the 
worst economy since the Great Depres-
sion. The Labor Department said last 
week that 12.6 million Americans are 
collecting unemployment benefits. One 
year ago, that number stood at just 1.7 
million. 
Renewable energy can and should be 
part of the equation in rebuilding this 
economy because, make no mistake, 
Mr. Speaker, jobs in things like solar 
energy will be created. The only ques-
tion is whether they are created here 
or in other countries like China. I want 
them made in America. 
Lastly, the Rules Committee consid-
ered two bills on Monday to help de-
fend the human rights of Uyghurs and 
other ethnic minorities who have suf-
fered horrific human rights abuses at 
the hands of the Chinese Government: 
H.R. 6210, the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act, and H.R. 6270, the 
Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act. 
I am proud to have authored H.R. 
6210, which passed the House with an 
overwhelming 406–3 vote yesterday. I 
also strongly support H.R. 6270, the 
Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act, 
authored by my colleague, Representa-
tive JENNIFER WEXTON. 
It is disappointing that some Repub-
lican Members may oppose the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Disclosure Act that re-
quires disclosures about products made 
with forced labor from a region where 
crimes against humanity and perhaps 
genocide are being committed by the 
Chinese Government. 
As many as 1.8 million Uyghurs and 
other predominantly Muslim minori-
ties have been arbitrarily detained in 
mass internment camps and subjected 
to forced labor, torture, political in-
doctrination, and other severe human 
rights abuses. 
We know forced labor is widespread 
and systematic, and audits are simply 
not possible because workers cannot 
speak freely and honestly about work-
ing conditions given the heavy surveil-
lance and intimidation by the Chinese 
Government. 
This legislation is essential to pro-
tect American investors and consumers 
through stronger disclosure require-
ments alerting them to the presence of 
Chinese and international companies 
whose operations enable the mass in-
ternment and population surveillance 
of Uyghurs and other Muslim minori-
ties. 
Such involvements represent clear 
and material risks to shared values and 
the corporate reputations of these com-
panies and U.S. investors and con-
sumers. 
It seems the only argument against 
this bill is that it is similar to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo con-
flict minerals provision from years 
ago, but the comparison simply just 
doesn’t hold water. 
Free enterprise, as we know it, 
doesn’t exist in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region. It should not be 
compared to Africa in terms of the 
business climate or access. 
The Xinjiang economy is tightly con-
trolled and directed by the Chinese 
Government and Communist Party. It 
is built on a foundation of forced labor 
and repression. International observ-
ers, the press, and government officials 
are restricted from even traveling 
there. 
Just this week, a number of re-
spected supply chain auditing firms say 
they will no longer conduct inspections 
in Xinjiang because of the hostile envi-
ronment ruled by fear. 
The argument against this legisla-
tion is that the DRC conflict minerals 
provision was bad because businesses 
left that region because they didn’t 
want to or could not disclose their sup-
ply chains. Well, it is long past time 
for U.S. and international companies 
to reassess their supply chains and find 
alternatives to production in Xinjiang 
where forced labor is widespread and 
embedded in the regional economy. 
We don’t think Chinese, U.S., and 
international companies should be ex-
ploiting the Uyghur and other Muslim 
people in allowing global supply chains 
to be contaminated with forced labor. 
So I hope on both sides of the aisle, 
but I say this to my Republican col-
leagues, to those who might be consid-
ering a ‘‘no’’ vote, think long and hard 
before voting against the bill that 
would help reveal the extent of how the 
Chinese Government’s system of forced 
labor has contaminated global supply 
chains. 
I am proud to stand in solidarity 
with the Uyghur people and, indeed, all 
the people living under the rule of the 
Chinese Government in their struggle 
to live freely, practice their religious 
beliefs freely, and speak their own lan-
guage freely. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join 
with us and give this rule and under-
lying bills a broad bipartisan vote so 
we can fulfill our obligations here at 
home and around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman MCGOVERN for yielding me 
the customary 30 minutes, and I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this rule consists of two 
bills, including H.R. 4447, the Demo-
crat’s energy package. It consists of 38 
bills with a total cost of $135 billion. 
The bill includes burdensome mandates 
and an incredibly high price tag. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear, Repub-
licans support reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions in the United States by scal-
ing up clean energy innovation with 
less regulation. Unfortunately, this bill 
adds new regulatory hurdles that make 
the clean energy technology deploy-
ment much more difficult to build. 
Regulations hurt innovations, espe-
cially at such a high price tag.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4727 
September 23, 2020 
The bill fails to put forward policies 
that will reform the permitting and li-
censing process required to finance, 
build, expand, and modernize energy 
infrastructure. Instead, the bill spends 
billions of dollars on unfocused re-
search without spending money on in-
vestments and infrastructure. 
Republicans have introduced numer-
ous bills this Congress that will build, 
expand, and modernize our energy in-
frastructure. 
b 1130 
They remove regulatory barriers to 
building nuclear, natural gas, and hy-
dropower infrastructure. These are all 
clean and reliable sources of genera-
tion that will power America, protect 
the environment, and keep our country 
secure. 
The mandates contained in the bill 
will drive up energy and transportation 
costs for American consumers. For ex-
ample, one of the mandates in the bill 
will mandate energy efficiency build-
ing codes, which the home building in-
dustry says will drive up the cost of 
housing to consumers without propor-
tional savings in energy costs. 
H.R. 4447 will lead our country down 
the wrong path. We don’t want to Cali-
fornia the Nation with blackouts and 
high 
utility 
costs. 
Even 
minority 
groups are suing California utilities 
over their high energy costs. And be-
lieve it or not, California utilities ac-
tually pay Arizona for their renewable 
energy to take it off of their hands dur-
ing certain times of the year. That is 
totally insane. 
I regularly meet with constituents 
and companies in Arizona who say they 
moved from California to Arizona be-
cause California’s incredibly burden-
some regulations stifle growth. Califor-
nia’s current energy crisis was predict-
able and avoidable, but they ignored 
the scientists and engineers who main-
tain the electric grid and, instead, 
mandated their own version of the 
Green New Deal. In doing so, California 
forced the retirement of stable base-
load power generation without a reli-
able option in place. 
The Democrats may claim that H.R. 
4447 is a bipartisan bill. While it in-
cludes some bipartisan provisions, it is 
not a bipartisan bill. It was crafted 
solely by Democrats with no input 
from Republicans. Many of the provi-
sions amount to billions of dollars of 
new and overlapping programs that had 
little to no process or regular order. 
I sit on the Rules Committee, where 
my 
colleagues 
reminisce 
regularly 
about how we used to operate through 
a 
committee 
system 
with 
regular 
order: a legislative hearing, a sub-
committee markup, a full complete 
markup. Apparently, those days are 
gone. Now the Democrats legislate by 
posting a one-sided bill one week and 
putting it on the floor the following 
week. 
Public laws do not come out of this 
process well, only partisan politics and 
messaging bills. We all know that. 
Mr. Speaker, this rule also contains 
H.R. 6270, the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Disclosure Act. 
The United States is an honorable 
and noble country that must not tol-
erate the gross human rights abuses 
perpetrated by Chinese leaders. While 
the bill takes strong action to ensure 
American businesses are not complicit 
in China’s forced labor programs, there 
are outstanding concerns in the bill 
that may harm U.S. businesses. 
For instance, the bill requires public 
companies to file disclosures with the 
SEC if they imported manufactured 
goods or other materials that origi-
nated in or are sourced in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region and dis-
close whether those goods originated in 
forced labor camps. These entities 
would also have to disclose the nature 
and extent of the commercial activity 
related to each good or material, the 
gross revenue and net profits attrib-
utable, and whether they intend to 
continue importing the good. 
China’s atrocities against Uyghurs 
and other Muslim minority groups 
must come to an end, and we voted on 
that bill yesterday in a bipartisan fash-
ion. We must ensure that items made 
with forced labor are not allowed to 
enter our markets. 
To do our jobs properly in Congress, 
we must allow bills to run their course 
through committees for proper debate, 
discovery, and amending. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to diverge from 
what we are considering today and rec-
ognize some of the people here who 
help us all navigate how legislation is 
considered. 
There are staff here that work day in 
and day out to make this Chamber 
function smoothly so that we can get 
things done on behalf of the American 
people. They aren’t Democratic or Re-
publican staff. They serve both sides 
without fear or favor. That team in-
cludes the staff in the Office of the Par-
liamentarian. 
Tom Wickham has served in that of-
fice for the last 25 years. As House Par-
liamentarian, he became a master of 
House procedure. And make no mis-
take, having an encyclopedic knowl-
edge of how this place operates is no 
small thing, Mr. Speaker. 
Tom is now retiring after serving 
with distinction for many years. I want 
to recognize him, and I want to thank 
him for that service here today. 
Now, I could say a lot about Tom. On 
a physical level, Tom is usually the 
tallest person in the room, and a lot of 
people fit in this room. On a human 
level, Tom always makes time for ev-
eryone, from the most senior Members 
to the most junior staff. Unless he is in 
a meeting, the door to his office right 
across the hall is literally left open all 
the time. 
He has perfected the art of dry par-
liamentary humor. It is incredibly im-
pressive when someone can make ger-
maneness, 
promptly 
motions, 
and 
Deschler’s Precedents funny. 
Tom is always willing to listen to ar-
gument and never too proud to change 
his mind or say he was wrong about 
something in the face of new informa-
tion. 
To me and my staff, Tom Wickham 
appears to know everything about the 
rules and history of this House. But he 
is quick to say that he knows nothing 
about the Senate whenever we ask a 
Senate question; although, we suspect 
he knows everything about the Senate 
as well and just doesn’t want to offend 
his friend, Elizabeth, the Senate Par-
liamentarian. 
Tom has guided us through some tur-
bulent times. He has advised the pre-
siding officer during times of heated 
debate, even yelling at times. He has 
been on that rostrum through impeach-
ment proceedings and opening day ses-
sions, during late nights often followed 
by all-too-early mornings. 
He has seen it all, and we are lucky 
to have had him at our side through it 
all. He will be missed, but we congratu-
late him on a well-deserved retirement. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to congratu-
late Jason Smith for being named the 
new House Parliamentarian. Many of 
us already know Jason pretty well, 
having worked with him in his prior 
role as Deputy Parliamentarian. His 
know-how made an impression, since 
he was named to this new role after a 
bipartisan 
recommendation, 
and 
I 
think that also is a tribute to his 
skills. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rank-
ing Member COLE for working with me 
on this. I valued his advice and coun-
sel, as I do so often as we serve to-
gether on the Rules Committee. His 
wisdom made this process largely an 
apolitical one. 
I could not ask for a better partner 
at the Rules Committee than the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma, TOM COLE. He 
and I try to put this institution first, 
and I know that Jason will, too. 
It is clear Jason has the confidence of 
both sides of the aisle, and that is no 
small thing. I look forward to working 
with him in his new role. 
The truth is we are lucky to have 
such dedicated staff in the Parliamen-
tarian’s Office, and that includes Anne 
Gooch, who works with us day in and 
day out, whether it is at 7 a.m. or 11 
p.m. My staff and I have her on speed 
dial. Her work also makes our work 
possible, and we are grateful. 
So we have a lot of debates on this 
floor, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
all 
to 
make 
progress on behalf of the American peo-
ple, but it is important during mo-
ments like this that we also recognize 
people whose work behind the scenes 
makes this progress possible. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to pay 
this tribute to these incredible people, 
and I want to say thank you, thank 
you, thank you. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4728 
September 23, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE), my good friend, the 
ranking member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman, my good friend, for 
yielding. 
I want to begin by responding to 
some of my friend’s kind remarks, the 
chairman. 
We belong to different parties. We 
sometimes have our different points of 
view in the committee itself, which 
means on occasion we are going to be 
taking contrasting positions with one 
another, but I think one of the com-
mon traits that we have is that we 
both revere the institution of the 
House of Representatives and all of its 
procedures. 
I think we also really respect the 
staff, the personal staff, the committee 
staff, and, most especially, the profes-
sional staff of the House itself. What an 
extraordinary role they play in allow-
ing us to do our job. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to join Chairman 
MCGOVERN in paying tribute to a dedi-
cated public servant. 
Tom Wickham, the House Parliamen-
tarian, has served this House with 
honor and distinction for the past 25 
years and will be taking a well-de-
served retirement at the end of this 
month. 
Tom has expertly advised five Speak-
ers and countless Members and staff 
throughout his distinguished tenure. 
His exceptional knowledge and under-
standing of the rules, procedures, and 
parliamentary precedent has been in-
valuable to this institution, and he will 
be sorely missed. 
Mr. Speaker, I am also proud to con-
gratulate Jason Smith, the current 
Deputy Parliamentarian, on his ap-
pointment as the sixth Parliamen-
tarian of the House. 
The Rules Committee has the benefit 
of working with the Parliamentarian’s 
Office, frankly, more than any other 
committee, and I have every con-
fidence that Jason will lead the office 
with the same standard of excellence 
his 
predecessors, 
particularly 
Mr. 
Wickham, have set. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I just want to 
take a moment to thank Chairman 
MCGOVERN for seeking my opinion dur-
ing the process to select our next Par-
liamentarian. That is not something he 
was required to do, but it speaks vol-
umes about his respect for this institu-
tion and the role that the Parliamen-
tarian plays for the minority, particu-
larly on the Rules Committee, that he 
was interested in our perspective on 
this important decision. 
Let me close with this. My friend, 
the chairman, said that Mr. Wickham 
had seen everything. 
Well, we are hopeful that you don’t 
write about everything that you have 
seen, and that you remember us as 
fondly as we remember you. But the 
sad thing is not very many people get 
to see your work and what you and 
your colleagues in the Parliamentar-
ian’s Office have done for each and 
every Member of this institution. Even 
our own Members quite often don’t un-
derstand how indispensable your deci-
sions and recommendations are to each 
side, to facilitate a full and open de-
bate, to make sure that every person 
has an opportunity to express their 
opinion in the appropriate way under 
the procedures and rules of the House. 
So I just want to personally thank 
you for the extraordinary job you have 
done for all of those who have the 
privilege of being Members and, frank-
ly, for our staffs as well, who work so 
closely with you and whom you advise 
so frequently and so professionally. We 
will really, really, really miss you, but 
we thank you for making sure that we 
had an adequate successor in place in 
Mr. Smith and a superb supporting 
staff that reflects your leadership. 
So we thank you for your hard work 
in a very bipartisan way, your profes-
sionalism, your decency, and, frankly, 
the honorable way in which you have 
discharged your duties for 25 years. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
think the gentleman from Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE) would agree with me that 
we both learned more from the Parlia-
mentarian’s Office than we ever knew 
was possible as we engaged in trying to 
get a replacement for Mr. Wickham. 
Our admiration for the staff there has 
only increased. 
I just want to say one final thing 
here. 
Normally, 
under 
normal 
cir-
cumstances, this Chamber would be 
filled with Members, which I think we 
would all have preferred in order to 
give you a proper sendoff. Obviously, 
outside events have made that impos-
sible, but we want you to know that ev-
erybody in this Chamber appreciates 
your incredible work. So I ask every-
body who is here to give you a round of 
applause and say thank you. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1145 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
immediately consider Small Business 
Committee Ranking Member STEVE 
CHABOT’s H.R. 8265 to reopen the Pay-
check Protection Program to Amer-
ica’s 30 million small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
LESKO. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
amendment would ensure our Nation’s 
smallest and most vulnerable firms get 
the support they need by allowing an 
opportunity for a second PPP loan 
with specific funds set aside for small 
businesses with 10 or fewer employees, 
expand the list of eligible covered ex-
penses, simplify the loan forgiveness 
process, and extend PPP through the 
end of 2020. 
I think all of us can agree that this is 
very vital for our small businesses and 
their workers in America. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. KATKO), my good friend. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, there are seven legisla-
tive days remaining on the House cal-
endar before this Chamber is scheduled 
to recess for more than a month. As 
every Member of this body knows, 
Americans are counting on us to use 
this time to respond to the sustained 
impact of the pandemic on our commu-
nities. 
Unfortunately, our constituents are 
left waiting as partisanship continues 
to block compromise and political in-
terests continue to stand in the way of 
efforts to deliver relief to our constitu-
ents. 
For this reason, I support efforts to 
defeat the previous question and bring 
up commonsense legislation to support 
America’s small businesses during this 
unprecedented crisis. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
has been a critical, bipartisan success 
and an important example of what we 
can achieve when we work together for 
the good of the American people. In my 
district alone, PPP loans have deliv-
ered critical assistance to thousands of 
local businesses and helped save nearly 
200,000 jobs. 
Although these loans played a piv-
otal role in helping small businesses 
navigate the immediate impact of the 
pandemic, many still face a dire eco-
nomic outlook and uncertain road to 
recovery. 
Absent congressional action, entre-
preneurs and business owners across 
this great country will have no choice 
but to close their doors. 
If the previous question is defeated, 
my colleagues will bring up legislation 
to authorize a second round of PPP 
loans for America’s most vulnerable 
businesses and extend the program 
through the end of 2020. 
Critically, this bill will also set aside 
funds for our smallest businesses and 
make necessary simplifications to the 
loan forgiveness process. These provi-
sions are not only critical to pro-
tecting our country’s 30 million small 
businesses and the jobs they create; 
they represent a commitment to relief 
measures both parties can agree on. 
Considering these changes would rep-
resent a critical first step in bringing 
bipartisan relief measures to the floor 
and delivering comprehensive relief for 
every American. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote to defeat the previous question.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4729 
September 23, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I just want to say for the record that 
if my Republican friends want to know 
why there is no agreement on another 
coronavirus relief package including 
PPP, they should call their friend 
MITCH MCCONNELL because this House 
did its job. 
We passed the HEROES Act more 
than 125 days ago to help cash-strapped 
State and local governments, to help 
businesses on the brink, and to help 
Americans struggling in the middle of 
this pandemic. 
A lot of people are suffering. Hunger 
has increased in this country. Senate 
Republicans can’t even come to an 
agreement amongst themselves. They 
couldn’t even get their entire caucus 
on board, let alone Democrats. 
The HEROES Act is bipartisan, but 
even that hasn’t been enough to get 
MITCH MCCONNELL to take it up. Appar-
ently, he couldn’t find the time, Mr. 
Speaker, but he is moving with light-
ning speed to confirm a new Supreme 
Court Justice. 
Are you kidding me? In the middle of 
a pandemic he can’t find the time to 
provide a vote on a package to help the 
American people and small businesses? 
Our restaurants are in deep trouble. 
Those of us who come from States— 
like I do in Massachusetts—outdoor 
dining is going to cease pretty soon be-
cause it is getting cold, and they don’t 
know how they are going to get 
through the winter. And we can’t even 
get the Senate to debate this stuff? 
More than 200,000 Americans are 
dead. The President says, Oh, every-
thing is going great. 200,000 people are 
dead. Compare that to Canada or other 
countries that actually had a plan to 
manage this pandemic. Countless mil-
lions have been infected. 
The Senate needs to act. And shame 
on them for not acting. 
It should be more than just an assem-
bly line that rubber-stamps conserv-
ative judges. There is legislating to do, 
and none more important than dealing 
with the impacts of this pandemic. 
I don’t know whether the Senate ma-
jority leader has a heart of stone or 
what, but it is inexcusable. It is uncon-
scionable. It is unbelievable that he 
hasn’t acted, and so I urge my Repub-
lican colleagues to pick up the phone 
and call him and tell him to do some-
thing. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded not to engage in per-
sonalities toward the Senate or its 
Members. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, wow, that was an im-
passioned speech by the chairman, but 
I have to remind the chairman that 
there were a lot of Democrat liberal 
wish lists in the relief package that 
were passed, including releasing pris-
oners that were 50 years old and older— 
didn’t matter what they were charged 
with—from prison and giving $1,200 re-
lief payments to illegal immigrants 
using taxpayer dollars. 
So maybe if Speaker PELOSI and the 
Democrats would have actually talked 
to Republicans before they pushed 
through a bill, there would have been 
more bipartisan support to help small 
businesses and the American people. 
With this previous question and the 
amendment, we are trying to do just 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON), 
my friend. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today and ask that we defeat the pre-
vious question and move to pass Con-
gressman CHABOT’s bill. 
We are now in our sixth month of 
this pandemic. In our efforts to combat 
this virus, the backbone of our econ-
omy, our small businesses, have suf-
fered greatly. Only now, after months 
of government-imposed restrictions, is 
our economy starting to reopen and we 
are seeing the unemployment drop, in 
part, but not throughout our economy. 
Even in my home State of Nebraska, 
with the lowest unemployment rate in 
the Nation, some of our small busi-
nesses are still struggling. While res-
taurants and bars are getting back to 
work, others are still shut down. Our 
live music venues, our playhouses, our 
travel and tour companies are still fac-
ing some very dark times and may not 
open for 3 months. Some may never re-
open without Congressman CHABOT’s 
bill. 
Congress needs to put our partisan 
differences aside. Stop playing elec-
tion-year political games and come to-
gether to help the American people. 
While we may be divided on if we 
should bail out cities that were strug-
gling financially prior to COVID, we 
can all agree that certain segments of 
our economy are struggling in every 
city. 
This bill will help our Nation’s small-
est, most vulnerable businesses in 
every city. It will expand eligibility 
and expand the PPP throughout the 
end of the calendar year to help these 
businesses in every city. 
We can agree that this is needed from 
the East Coast to the West Coast and 
everywhere 
in-between. 
Congress 
should act now. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat the 
previous question and move to pass the 
low-hanging fruit of the Chabot bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the good news and what 
is comforting to me is that the Amer-
ican people get this. They understand 
where the problem is. 
And I would just say to my friends 
who don’t like everything in the HE-
ROES Act, the way this process is sup-
posed to work is we pass a bill in the 
House, the Senate passes a bill, and 
then we have a conference committee 
and we work out the details. 
Well, the only negotiating that has 
been going on is Democrats have been 
negotiating with themselves. We have 
actually lowered the request in the 
original HEROES Act—which I person-
ally think is not the right thing to do, 
but I get it—to get something done. 
There is nothing in here that helps 
communities who are trying to deal 
with the school situation. In some 
places schools are opening, in some 
places they are not but there are all of 
these new expenses on how to make the 
classroom safer. 
When my friends say, Oh, we don’t 
want to give any more money to cities 
and towns to deal with that, I don’t 
know whether you talk to your super-
intendents, or your teachers, or your 
principals, or parents, but this is real 
and they are looking for some help. 
I mean, we are in the middle of a pan-
demic. We haven’t seen anything like 
this since 1918. It has impacted our en-
tire economy and you would never 
know it. You would never know it 
based on the inaction and the indiffer-
ence over in the Senate. 
I mean, it just takes my breath away 
when we have leaders there, Repub-
lican leaders, who won’t even come to 
the negotiating table. And I just find 
that appalling. 
I will just say one other thing. I urge 
everybody to vote for the previous 
question because let me just tell you 
something that some people don’t ap-
preciate; if you defeat the previous 
question, they get to bring up whatever 
they want to bring up. 
They can bring up this, they can 
bring up whatever. They basically take 
control of the House. And they may say 
they are going to bring up this, but 
who knows what they will bring up. 
And so this is a bad procedural maneu-
ver, but it is designed to give them 
power. 
And, again, what I am learning here 
is that we don’t share the same values 
on a lot of these things. I find that par-
ticularly disconcerting during a pan-
demic. 
In the past, after 9/11, I was here. 
George W. Bush was President. I didn’t 
agree with him on a lot of stuff, but he 
helped bring this country together and 
get us all reading off the same sheet of 
music in terms of our response. It is 
very different now. 
So I would urge my colleagues again 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the previous question, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I can 
guarantee Chairman MCGOVERN, if we 
defeat 
the 
previous 
question, 
my 
amendment is what will be brought up 
to help small businesses and their 
workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. REED). 
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend for yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I had a speech prepared 
to give, but I am not going to read that 
speech because I think the chairman 
from Massachusetts highlighted the 
crux of the problem we face in this 
Chamber today. 
We don’t trust each other any longer 
in this institution. As he just alluded

to, don’t give over the floor, don’t give 
over control of this body to the other 
side because we don’t know what the 
Republicans will bring up. 
I give my word that what we would 
bring up is a bill that will provide im-
mediate relief under the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program of $138 billion to our 
small businesses, our families, and in-
dividuals who are suffering in America 
today. 
We need to start trusting each other 
again. We don’t trust each other in this 
institution and that is what is causing 
the American people to suffer. 
I ask my colleagues: When you vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this previous question, be on 
notice. You are turning your back on 
the American people that need the 
Paycheck Protection Program assist-
ance today. And when you make that 
vote, you do it with your eyes wide 
open. You do it on notice that you will 
be turning your back on those individ-
uals who cry out for help as we speak 
here on this floor today. 
What we are talking about here is 
that we need to do our job as Congress. 
Now, I have done everything in my 
power 
personally 
over 
the 
last 
3 
months to work with our Senate col-
leagues, to work with the White House, 
to work in a bipartisan fashion to do a 
bigger package than the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program. But I will take what 
I can get. 
There should be bipartisan support 
for this Paycheck Protection Program 
relief that we are talking about here 
today. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat the 
previous question, vote ‘‘no,’’ and join 
us and trust us in standing with the 
American people. 
b 1200 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for 
the gentleman from New York, and I 
appreciate his efforts at trying to find 
common ground and trying to make 
this place work better. But I do take 
exception to a statement he made, that 
if you vote against this, then you are 
turning your backs on small busi-
nesses. 
Well, I can make that same argument 
to all of my Republican friends who 
voted against the HEROES Act. Not 
only did they turn their backs on small 
businesses, they turned their backs on 
schools and on people who right now 
are going hungry in this country. I can 
go right down the list of all the things. 
They are turning their backs on cities 
and towns that are not just blue cities 
and towns. 
Mr. Speaker, this notion that we 
have to define everything in terms of 
red and blue, in terms of whether they 
get 
assistance, 
I 
find 
very 
dis-
concerting. I never question a vote in 
favor of disaster relief if a red State 
was hit by a hurricane or an earth-
quake or a fire. You try to do the right 
thing. 
So spare us the indignation, because 
the deal is, we passed something here 4 
months ago, and there has been no ac-
tion. We all know that we weren’t 
going to get everything. The Speaker 
brought it down by $1 trillion, hoping 
that that would spur a negotiation, and 
there is nothing yet. By the way, the 
Senate can’t even get its act together 
amongst its own Republicans, never 
mind with Democrats. 
So we need to do something. Hope-
fully, before we leave here, the Senate 
majority leader will pick up the phone 
and work with the Speaker and with 
the White House, and we can get some-
thing here. 
Quite frankly, all of us, if it is not 
done, are willing to come back here on 
a moment’s notice. We have all been 
told by our majority leader to be pre-
pared to come back here in a nano-
second if we can get a deal. 
But to leave schools behind, to leave 
hungry people behind, and to leave 
countless others who have been im-
pacted by this virus behind, this is a 
big deal. It is a big deal. We need to 
help our small businesses, and we have 
to help others as well. 
Let’s hope rationality will prevail, 
common sense will prevail, and we can 
come together similar to the way we 
did on the continuing resolution yes-
terday. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Boy, I have read some 
media reports where actually there 
were members of the Democratic Party 
in the U.S. House of Representatives in 
swing 
districts 
who 
pleaded 
with 
Speaker PELOSI to have a relief pack-
age, and she is the one who said: Oh, 
no. 
So I have to respectfully disagree 
with the gentleman’s analogy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, it has now been over 46 
days since the Paycheck Protection 
Program, also known as PPP, was shut 
down. This means that small busi-
nesses have been prevented from apply-
ing for CARES Act funding through the 
PPP for over a month and a half now. 
This also means that real people’s jobs 
continue to be in jeopardy through no 
fault of their own. 
This is just unacceptable, Mr. Speak-
er. This is unacceptable because small 
businesses play an outsized role in our 
economy. They employ half of all 
workers in this country. Think about 
that. Nearly one out of every two 
workers in this country are employed 
by small businesses. Not only do small 
businesses employ millions of people, 
but they are also this Nation’s job cre-
ators. They create approximately two 
out of every three new jobs in this 
country. 
Beyond statistics, they are the heart-
beat of Main Streets all across Amer-
ica. They are the corner store, the 
neighborhood coffee shop, and the res-
taurant in the town or village. They 
are the fabric of commerce in my home 
State of Ohio, as they are in Florida, in 
Texas, in California, and all across this 
country. Their workers clock in early 
and often retire after the sun sets. 
Simply put, they are America’s busi-
nesses. 
Unfortunately, COVID–19 continues 
to challenge their very existence. Now 
is the time to act. We really should 
have acted 46 days ago. We have an op-
tion before us today, this very day. If 
we defeat today’s previous question, 
then we can move directly to my legis-
lation to reopen the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program to all those small busi-
nesses all over the country that are 
clamoring to get them and that really 
need them. 
H.R. 8265 would provide targeted as-
sistance to small businesses that truly 
need the Federal Government’s help. 
The legislation gives small businesses 
the opportunity to receive a second 
PPP if they can demonstrate a signifi-
cant revenue reduction of 25 percent. 
Additionally, it adds more flexibility 
in how PPP dollars can be spent and 
still be eligible to have those loans for-
given. 
Many of our Nation’s small busi-
nesses 
are 
still 
struggling 
signifi-
cantly. We need to work quickly to 
provide a path forward for as many of 
them as possible. Just as small busi-
nesses meet and exceed the expectation 
of their customers, let’s meet the needs 
of small businesses across the country. 
Let’s defeat the previous question and 
restart the PPP, the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program. 
Our 
economy 
is 
depending 
upon 
America’s small businesses, and Amer-
ica’s small businesses are depending 
upon us here today. This vote really 
does matter. Usually, these things are 
procedural, but this is an opportunity 
not just to help those small businesses 
but, most importantly, those people 
who work for them and the families 
they support. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me remind all of my 
colleagues this is a procedural vote, 
and this is a very common practice of 
my Republican colleagues on a regular 
basis to urge a defeat of the previous 
question so they can bring up whatever 
they want to bring up. 
The gentleman just said that we need 
to move quickly. My question is: Where 
have you been? Where have you been? 
Four months ago—4 months ago—we 
passed a bill that would provide relief 
to our small businesses and to our 
cash-strapped communities, many of 
them forced to lay off first responders. 
Where have you been? Have you 
picked up the phone and called MITCH 
MCCONNELL? Have you lobbied any of 
your Republican colleagues on the Sen-
ate side? Nothing. 
We are about to recess. I think every-
body knows that people back home are 
not happy with the obstructionism and 
the Senate doing nothing. So let’s toss 
out a procedural vote, and we can use 
that as cover. Talk about being cyn-
ical.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4731 
September 23, 2020 
We had an opportunity. We still have 
an opportunity to come together and 
do something that will help all Ameri-
cans. Instead, this is the best we can 
do, no promises to talk to the Senate, 
no nothing. 
It is just frustrating because people 
are hurting, and it is not enough at the 
last minute to come up with a proce-
dural vote that doesn’t mean anything 
and all along having been opposed to 
the HEROES Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I can 
guarantee that if we were in the major-
ity, we would be able to do a relief 
package that didn’t include liberal 
wish lists that could actually pass the 
Senate and get signed into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN 
HERN). 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge defeat of the previous 
question so that we can immediately 
move to debate and pass H.R. 8265 and 
stop playing politics with American 
businesses and jobs. 
We all can name at least one favorite 
establishment that is now an economic 
casualty of coronavirus. Many small 
businesses are hurting, and they need 
our help. 
We came together in an incredible bi-
partisan way this spring to create the 
Paycheck Protection Program, but the 
fallout of these shutdowns is lasting 
longer than any of us dared believe, 
and our communities are now in need 
of swift action. 
That is exactly why we need a vote 
on H.R. 8265, which Democratic leader-
ship is currently preventing. There are 
over $135 billion still sitting in the 
funds that are authorized and appro-
priated. This bill gives small busi-
nesses with 25 percent revenue losses 
and under 300 employees the oppor-
tunity for a second cut at the PPP 
loan. It sets aside $25 billion specifi-
cally for mom-and-pop businesses with 
less than 10 employees, and it sim-
plifies the forgiveness process for loans 
under $150,000. 
Do it today. Do it today. We have 
plenty of time. To make it simple: 
Passing this bill saves jobs, but doing 
nothing sends those same people to the 
unemployment lines. The bills we are 
voting on today will never become law. 
Messaging bills can wait; extending 
this program cannot. 
I know that many of my colleagues 
across the aisle are frustrated with the 
lack of action on this issue. They like 
this bill and know it would help our 
communities. I know this because 
many have told me personally. If half 
of the Democrats who have privately 
told me they supported this legislation 
would vote for it, it would pass over-
whelmingly and would be law quickly. 
So I call on them today to stand up and 
do what is right. Their communities 
need them in this moment. America 
needs us all in this moment. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the Democrat 
leaders to stop playing politics with 
American businesses and jobs. I urge 
defeat of the previous question and im-
mediate consideration of H.R. 8265. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is unclear to me what 
this President would or would not sign. 
I am looking at a headline from CBS 
News: ‘‘Trump said coronavirus ‘affects 
virtually nobody,’ as U.S. surpasses 
200,000 deaths.’’ 
Talk about clueless here. We passed 
the HEROES Act to help our schools 
and our healthcare workers. I would 
like to think that there is no objection 
to 
helping 
our 
schools 
and 
our 
healthcare workers. We want to help 
our first responders. They are the he-
roes here. 
Why is that such a controversial 
thing to do? 
We wanted to pass the HEROES Act 
to provide more testing and tracing so 
we can contain this virus. We are doing 
that while the President of the United 
States is hosting superspreader events 
where people without masks are all 
bunched together. 
We passed the HEROES Act to sup-
port families who are struggling to pay 
their rent, and we passed the HEROES 
Act to help small businesses. 
It is time for my Republican friends 
to pick up the phone, call Senator 
MCCONNELL, and ask him to sit down 
and negotiate a deal that helps the en-
tirety of this country. I don’t see why 
that is so controversial, yet they won’t 
do it. They won’t do it. This is cynical 
politics, pure and simple. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, again, if 
the so-called HEROES Act would not 
have been chock-full of a bunch of lib-
eral wish lists but only concentrated 
on things that Republicans and Demo-
crats could have actually agreed to and 
would have passed the Senate and then 
signed into law, we would have had re-
lief to the American people by now. 
But I would assume that Chairman 
MCGOVERN knows that there were cer-
tain things in that bill that they knew 
in 
advance 
that 
the 
Republicans 
weren’t going to go for, like releasing 
prisoners into the communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
HERRERA BEUTLER). 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to urge Repub-
licans and Democrats to join us on this 
vote to extend the vital jobs-saving 
program, the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, which will provide relief to small 
businesses that desperately need it dur-
ing this public health crisis. It is not 
just the small businesses that will ben-
efit. It is actually for the workers who 
work in those businesses to keep their 
jobs. 
With talk that the House Democrat 
leadership is looking to finish our leg-
islative business and send us home 
early, we should be doing everything 
that we can in our power to provide 
that relief to small businesses that des-
perately need it. 
In my district in southwest Wash-
ington, almost 9,500 small businesses 
have accessed critical paycheck protec-
tion loans. Surgical Training Institute 
in Camas was able to keep its 22 em-
ployees employed. The little Neptune 
Theatre in Pacific County also took ad-
vantage of this program. Altogether, 
they have saved 92,000 jobs. 
That is 92,000 people—individuals, 
moms, dads, brothers, and sisters—who 
are able to continue providing for their 
families by putting food on the table 
and keeping a roof over their kids’ 
heads. 
This should not be a political foot-
ball. Across the Nation, the PPP has 
helped save millions of jobs, and small 
businesses have been able to keep their 
doors open and pay their employees. 
This is not a partisan issue. Let’s 
stop talking about what was done in 
the past. Let’s look forward and fix the 
problem. Join with us now and support 
extending this program. 
To me, it is a shame that small busi-
ness relief and relief for workers is a 
partisan issue. It should not be treated 
like a political football here in Con-
gress. This is not a hostage we should 
hold on to to get anybody’s wish list 
passed. We should pass this. 
The fact of the matter is that the 
PPP expired on August 8, and we have 
been in session many days between now 
and then. With nearly $135 billion still 
in the program, Congress must act now 
to free up these funds and get relief to 
those who need it most. 
Thousands of businesses across the 
country are on the brink of collapse 
and mass layoffs, and they are crying 
out for help. If we do not act now to ex-
tend the PPP, they could all go under. 
We are talking about our neighborhood 
mom-and-pop shops that are the back-
bone of our communities. We don’t 
have any more time to waste. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the pre-
vious question so the House can ad-
vance bipartisan relief to small busi-
nesses.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I un-
derstand why the gentlewoman doesn’t 
want to talk about the past, because 4 
months ago, she—as well as most Re-
publicans—voted ‘‘no’’ on the HEROES 
Act. They voted to deny help to small 
businesses. They voted to deny help to 
our schools, to our healthcare workers, 
to our first responders. 
Mr. Speaker, I get it. She and others 
are going to have to explain to their 
constituents why they did that, why 
they voted against the interests of 
their own constituents. So I get it. 
But the bottom line is this: If my Re-
publican friends want to help, pick up 
the phone and call their friend, MITCH 
MCCONNELL, and ask him to get serious 
about negotiating a compromise here 
so we can help small businesses and 
also help our schools and our first re-
sponders and our healthcare workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

H4732 
September 23, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, at a time 
when many Americans are struggling 
with the economic fallout from the on-
going pandemic, it is unfortunate that 
the Democratic majority is not coming 
up with solutions that can actually be 
signed into law. We need to negotiate 
with the Republicans in the Senate and 
the President and the Democrats to-
gether. That is what America wants. 
Instead, in this rule, we are focusing 
on a Green New Deal-type of energy 
package—one that didn’t work so well 
in California, as can be attested to by 
their rolling blackouts and other en-
ergy crises. 
Mr. Speaker, I would call on us to de-
feat the previous question so that we 
can add the amendment to, at least, 
help the small businesses and their 
workers. This is something we can do 
together. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ on the 
previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying measure, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my friend just men-
tioned ‘‘the least’’ we can do. Well, this 
is not the time to do the least of any-
thing. We are faced with a pandemic, 
haven’t seen the likes of this since 1918. 
This is a big deal. It impacts every part 
of our economy. And they are talking 
about ‘‘the least.’’ 
Well, you know what? We have to 
help our small businesses; we have to 
help our schools. We have to protect 
our first responders and our healthcare 
workers. This impacts everybody. And 
the notion that they can’t muster the 
political will to pick up the phone and 
ask the Senate to negotiate with us is 
really, really sad, and it is a disservice 
to the people of this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I get it. Like every-
thing in the HEROES Act—well, that is 
what a negotiation is for, you go back 
and forth, and you trade things off. I 
would argue everything in the HE-
ROES Act is necessary and important. 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge my col-
leagues to support the rule. It includes 
an important energy bill that will help 
us deal with the climate crisis, which 
is real—no matter what the President 
says, we have a climate crisis—and 
some human rights legislation as well, 
to stand up for the human rights of the 
Uyghurs, and make sure that no U.S. 
or international businesses are uti-
lizing forced labor by the Chinese Gov-
ernment against the Uyghurs. 
Mr. Speaker, again, we have a job to 
do here, and that is to provide relief 
during this pandemic. And it really is 
frustrating that my Republican friends 
have done nothing—done nothing—to 
help get us to a solution. 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge all my col-
leagues to join with us in support of 
the rule and the underlying measure. 
Please vote ‘‘yes’’ on the previous ques-
tion. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. LESKO is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1129 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this

tions to the paycheck protection program,

The bill shall be considered as read. All

SEC. 8. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question.

CARL NUNZIATO VA CLINIC 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 5023) to name the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs community- 
based outpatient clinic in Youngstown, 
Ohio, as the ‘‘Carl Nunziato VA Clin-
ic’’, and ask for its immediate consid-
eration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BROWNLEY of California.) Is there ob-
jection to the request of the gentleman 
from California? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5023 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Carl Nunziato graduated from Youngs-
town State University ROTC as the Distin-
guished Military Graduate in 1961 and com-
missioned into the U.S. Army. 
(2) While serving, Major (ret.) Nunziato 
was stationed in Thailand during the Lao-
tian Crisis. Major Nunziato later served two 
voluntary tours of combat duty in Vietnam. 
(3) On his second tour, then-Captain 
Nunziato was severely injured, losing both 
legs from a mortar attack while protecting a 
small Vietnamese village in Soui Da. 
(4) Major Nunziato spent two years at Wal-
ter Reed Military Hospital recovering from 
his wounds. He then returned home to North-
eastern Ohio where he enrolled in Case West-
ern University Law School earning a degree 
in 1971. Following retirement from active 
duty, Major Nunziato continuously cham-
pioned the rights of veterans and the dis-
abled, while establishing a distinguished ca-
reer in banking and finance. 
(5) Due to Major Nunziato’s tireless efforts, 
a Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient 
clinic was established in Youngstown. Addi-
tionally, his exhaustive work throughout 
Mahoning County has brought curb cuts, 
wheel chair ramps and other accessibility 
measures to county public buildings, univer-
sities and courthouses, affording more inde-
pendence to local disabled population. These 
efforts were borne from witnessing fellow 
disabled veterans denied justice and equal-
ity, after having fought and sacrificed for 
those same principles. 
SEC. 2. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AF-
FAIRS 
COMMUNITY-BASED 
OUT-
PATIENT 
CLINIC, 
YOUNGSTOWN, 
OHIO. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs com-
munity-based outpatient clinic in Youngs-
town, Ohio, shall, after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, be known and designated 
as the ‘‘Carl Nunziato VA Clinic’’. Any ref-
erence to such clinic in any law, regulation, 
map, document, record, or other paper of the 
United States shall be considered to be a ref-
erence to the Carl Nunziato VA Clinic. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, was read the 
third time, and passed, and a motion to 
reconsider was laid on the table.

Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF LIEUTENANT COLO-
NEL CHARLES S. KETTLES DEPART-
MENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MED-
ICAL CENTER. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Kettles 
was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on January 
9, 1930. 
(2) Lieutenant Colonel Kettles was drafted 
to the Army at age 21, and after attending 
Officer Candidate School, earned his com-
mission as an armor officer in the United 
States Army Reserve on February 28, 1953. 
(3) Lieutenant Colonel Kettles graduated 
from the Army Aviation School in 1953 be-
fore serving active duty tours in South 
Korea, Japan, and Thailand. 
(4) Lieutenant Colonel Kettles volunteered 
for active duty in 1963 when the United 
States was engaged in the Vietnam War. 
(5) Some of the awards and decorations 
earned by Lieutenant Colonel Kettles in-
clude the following: 
(A) The Medal of Honor. 
(B) The Distinguished Service Cross. 
(C) The Legion of Merit. 
(D) The Distinguished Flying Cross. 
(E) The Bronze Star Medal with one oak

(F) The Air Medal with numeral 27. 
(G) The Korean Service Medal. 
(H) The Vietnam Service Medal with one 
silver service star and one bronze service 
star. 
(I) The Master Aviator Badge. 
(6) The Medal of Honor citation for Lieu-
tenant 
Colonel 
Kettles 
states, 
‘‘Major 
Charles S. Kettles distinguished himself by 
conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while 
serving as Flight Commander, 176th Aviation 
Company (Airmobile) (Light), 14th Combat 
Aviation Battalion, Americal Division near 
Duc Pho, Republic of Vietnam. On 15 May 
1967, Major Kettles, upon learning that an 
airborne infantry unit had suffered casual-
ties during an intense firefight with the 
enemy, immediately volunteered to lead a 
flight of six UH–1D helicopters to carry rein-
forcements to the embattled force and to 
evacuate wounded personnel. Enemy small 
arms, automatic weapons, and mortar fire 
raked the landing zone, inflicting heavy 
damage to the helicopters; however, Major 
Kettles refused to depart until all heli-
copters were loaded to capacity. He then re-
turned to the battlefield, with full knowl-
edge of the intense enemy fire awaiting his 
arrival, to bring more reinforcements, land-
ing in the midst of enemy mortar and auto-
matic weapons fire that seriously wounded 
his gunner and severely damaged his air-
craft. Upon departing, Major Kettles was ad-
vised by another helicopter crew that he had 
fuel streaming out of his aircraft. Despite 
the risk posed by the leaking fuel, he nursed 
the damaged aircraft back to base. Later 
that day, the Infantry Battalion Commander 
requested immediate, emergency extraction 
of the remaining 40 troops, including four 
members of Major Kettles’ unit who were 
stranded when their helicopter was de-
stroyed by enemy fire. With only one flyable 
UH–1 helicopter remaining, Major Kettles 
volunteered to return to the deadly landing 
zone for a third time, leading a flight of six 
evacuation helicopters, five of which were 
from the 161st Aviation Company. During 
the extraction, Major Kettles was informed 
by the last helicopter that all personnel were 
onboard, and departed the landing zone ac-
cordingly. Army gunships supporting the 
evacuation also departed the area. Once air-
borne, Major Kettles was advised that eight 
troops had been unable to reach the evacu-
ation helicopters due to the intense enemy 
fire. With complete disregard for his own 
safety, Major Kettles passed the lead to an-
other helicopter and returned to the landing 
zone to rescue the remaining troops. Without 
gunship, artillery, or tactical aircraft sup-
port, the enemy concentrated all firepower 
on his lone aircraft, which was immediately 
damaged by a mortar round that shattered 
both front windshields and the chin bubble 
and was further raked by small arms and 
machine gun fire. Despite the intense enemy 
fire, Major Kettles maintained control of the 
aircraft and situation, allowing time for the 
remaining eight soldiers to board the air-
craft. In spite of the severe damage to his 
helicopter, Major Kettles once more skill-
fully guided his heavily damaged aircraft to 
safety. Without his courageous actions and 
superior flying skills, the last group of sol-
diers and his crew would never have made it 
off the battlefield. Major Kettles’ selfless 
acts of repeated valor and determination are 
in keeping with the highest traditions of 
military service and reflect great credit 
upon himself and the United States Army.’’. 
(b) DESIGNATION.—The medical center of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs in Ann 
Arbor, Michigan, shall after the date of the 
enactment of this Act be known and des-
ignated as the ‘‘Lieutenant Colonel Charles 
S. Kettles Department of Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center’’ or the ‘‘Lieutenant Colonel 
Charles S. Kettles VA Medical Center’’. 
(c) REFERENCE.—Any reference in any law, 
regulation, map, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the medical 
center referred to in subsection (b) shall be 
considered to be a reference to the Lieuten-
ant Colonel Charles S. Kettles Department of 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

SEC. 507. REPORT ON EFFORTS BY DEPARTMENT 
OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO IMPLE-
MENT SAFETY PLANNING IN EMER-
GENCY DEPARTMENTS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs 
must be more effective in its approach to re-
ducing the burden of veteran suicide con-
nected to mental health diagnoses, to in-
clude expansion of treatment delivered via 
telehealth methods and in rural areas. 
(2) An innovative project, known as Sui-
cide Assessment and Follow-up Engagement: 
Veteran Emergency Treatment (in this sub-
section referred to as ‘‘SAFE VET’’), was de-
signed to help suicidal veterans seen at 
emergency departments within the Veterans 
Health Administration and was successfully 
implemented in five intervention sites begin-
ning in 2010. 
(3) A 2018 study found that safety planning 
intervention under SAFE VET was associ-
ated with 45 percent fewer suicidal behaviors 
in the six-month period following emergency 
department care and more than double the 
odds of a veteran engaging in outpatient be-
havioral health care. 
(4) SAFE VET is a promising alternative 
and acceptable delivery of care system that 
augments the treatment of suicidal veterans 
in emergency departments of the Veterans 
Health Administration and helps ensure that 
those veterans have appropriate follow-up 
care. 
(5) Beginning in September 2018, the Vet-
erans Health Administration implemented a 
suicide prevention program, known as the 
SPED program, for veterans presenting to 
the emergency department who are assessed 
to be at risk for suicide and are safe to be 
discharged home. 
(6) The SPED program includes issuance 
and update of a safety plan and post-dis-
charge follow-up outreach for veterans to fa-
cilitate engagement in outpatient mental 
health care. 
(b) REPORT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall sub-
mit to the appropriate committees of Con-
gress a report on the efforts of the Secretary 
to implement a suicide prevention program 
for veterans presenting to an emergency de-
partment or urgent care center of the Vet-
erans Health Administration who are as-
sessed to be at risk for suicide and are safe

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 785. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 785, the Commander John Scott 
Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care 
Improvement Act. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
throughout 
the 
116th Congress, the House Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs has committed 
significant resources and energy with 
one goal in mind, addressing and help-
ing reduce veteran suicide. 
As a result, our committee has 
passed no less than 15 pieces of legisla-
tion that would address many of the 
upstream challenges that veterans con-
front, which can exacerbate mental 
health conditions and often lead vet-
erans into crisis. 
While we are not discussing all of 
these proposals today, I am hopeful 
that one bill, and the subject of today’s 
debate, S. 785, will provide additional 
tools and will lead to additional report-
ing that will inform our continued ef-
forts to address this multifaceted and 
complex challenge. 
There is no one solution to this issue, 
but I know that by working together 
we can continue to make meaningful 
progress. 
I also thank the members of my com-
mittee and other Members of this 
Chamber who offered legislation in the 
House to address gaps, enhance up-
stream prevention, and create addi-
tional resources to help veterans access 
care. Many of these components are in-
cluded in S. 785. 
Congressman SABLAN’s legislation in-
cluded in S. 785 extends VA healthcare 
to veterans for a 1-year period fol-
lowing discharge or release from active 
service. We know this is a crucial pe-
riod for veterans to be enrolled in and 
receive high-quality healthcare. 
Two provisions from Congressman 
CISNEROS’s bill are included in S. 785; 
one, directing VA to update its clinical 
practice guidelines for treating vet-
erans at risk of suicide, and the other 
mandating that VA develop clinical 
practice guidelines to standardize best 
practices for treating co-occurring sub-
stance use disorders, chronic pain, 
PTSD and/or traumatic brain injuries. 
b 1230 
Other members of my committee in-
troduced House companion legislation 
for key components of S. 785. 
Congresswoman LEE’s bill supported 
further telehealth expansion at the VA 
to capitalize on the use of technology 
and meeting veterans where they are. 
Congressman LAMB introduced legis-
lation to bring the VA’s complemen-
tary and integrated health services to 
even more veterans and also pushed the 
scientific enterprise to seek biomark-
ers and more tailored treatments for 
mental health problems through a new 
VA precision medicine initiative. 
Congressman 
BRINDISI’s 
bill 
will 
bring more resources to VA’s suicide 
prevention 
coordinators 
and 
more 
staffing in this critical area to VA 
medical centers. 
Madam Speaker, I want to say 
thanks to them and all our Members 
who introduced companion legislation 
to S. 785, and I now encourage my col-
leagues to join me in supporting S. 785. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of S. 785, the Com-
mander John Scott Hannon Veterans 
Mental Health Care Improvement Act 
of 2019. 
Today, and every day, approximately 
20 of our Nation’s veteran servicemem-
bers and members of the National 
Guard and Reserve will die by suicide. 
This bill is named after one of those 
veterans, 
Commander 
John 
Scott 
Hannon. 
One of its most important provisions 
is named after another, Staff Sergeant 
Parker Gordon Fox, who grew up in my 
district in east Tennessee. 
While we cannot bring back Com-
mander Hannon, Staff Sergeant Fox, or 
countless veterans like them, we can 
act by passing this bill today to help 
save the lives of the brothers and sis-
ters in arms they left behind. 
This Congress, both the House and 
Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committees 
have made it our priority to prevent 
veteran suicide. This bill represents 
the culmination of our work. 
We would not be here without the un-
wavering efforts of many individuals: 
Senators and Members of Congress 
from both sides of the aisle who have 
worked hard on the various compo-
nents of this bill; Secretary Wilkie and 
his team in VA and in the White House 
who have worked with us on a bipar-
tisan, bicameral basis to make sure we 
get it right; and our veterans service 
organization partners that have pro-
vided their input, expertise, and en-
couragement every step of the way. 
I would be remiss if I did not say a 
particular thank you to my friends and 
esteemed Senate colleagues, Chairman 
JERRY MORAN of Kansas and Ranking 
Member JON TESTER of Montana, the 
chairman and ranking member of the 
Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. 
I have had the honor and the privi-
lege of working with Senators MORAN 
and TESTER for many years, and I know 
that America’s veterans have no great-
er champions in the United States Sen-
ate than them. I am grateful for their

September 23, 2020 
hard work and steadfast leadership 
shepherding this bill to the President’s 
desk over the last year and a half. 
And, of course, I am also grateful to 
my friend and fellow leader of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, 
Congressman MARK
TAKANO
of Cali-
fornia. Since he took over the gavel 
last year, Chairman TAKANO has fo-
cused our committee’s work on veteran 
suicide prevention. I am proud to stand 
with him in pursuit of that goal. 
Veterans are 1.5 times more likely to 
die by suicide than nonveterans, in 
general, and veteran women are 2.2 
times more likely to die by suicide 
than nonveteran women. It is certainly 
not for lack of attention, effort, or de-
sire that the veteran suicide rate re-
mains as high as it has for as long as it 
has. 
When I came to Congress in 2009, the 
VA’s mental health budget was ap-
proximately $4 billion per year. When I 
leave Congress at the end of this year, 
the VA’s mental health budget will 
total approximately $10 billion. Over 
that nearly 12-year period, the veteran 
suicide rate has remained essentially 
the same, with approximately 20 lives 
lost per day. 
Finally lowering that number and 
eventually stopping veteran suicide al-
together will not be easy, but S. 785 
takes a number of different approaches 
that I believe will make a real dif-
ference to veterans in need. 
It includes provisions that would im-
prove access to care for veterans at 
risk of suicide; strengthening VA’s 
mental health workforce; expanding 
the availability of complementary and 
alternative techniques to improve vet-
eran quality of life; advancing impor-
tant research into diagnosis and treat-
ment of conditions like post-traumatic 
stress disorder, depression, anxiety, bi-
polar disorder, suicide ideation, and 
the connection between suicide and 
certain prescription medications; and 
support for servicemembers as they 
transition to civilian life, a time in 
which we know they are uniquely vul-
nerable 
to 
stresses 
and 
suicidal 
thoughts. 
S. 785 would also establish the Staff 
Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide 
Prevention Grant Program to support 
community-based organizations that 
provide needed care and other services 
to at-risk veterans in their neighbor-
hoods and backyards. 
The care and support that the VA of-
fers to veterans is second to none. 
Under 
President 
Trump’s 
direction 
these last 31⁄2 years, excellent strides 
have been made to increase access to 
care, expand veteran choice, strength-
en the veterans’ trust that they have in 
the VA healthcare system, and more. 
Only 6 of the 20 servicemembers and 
veterans who die by suicide each day 
had used VA care in the last 2 years 
prior to their death. Not all of those 
who have served are eligible for VA 
care. Even those who are eligible may 
sometimes find the barrier to entry to 
a VA medical center too high, espe-
cially when they already are stressed 
and struggling. 
If we truly want to prevent veteran 
suicide, I believe that we must expand 
the VA’s reach by partnering with 
well-respected 
community 
organiza-
tions that are meeting military fami-
lies where they are, developing long- 
lasting and meaningful relationships to 
help them heal, and connecting them 
with the VA and other sources of sup-
port that best suit their individual and 
family needs. 
The Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon 
Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program 
would create the mechanism to do that 
most effectively. It is based on the bi-
partisan IMPROVE Act, which is spon-
sored in the House by my good friend 
and ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Oversight and Investiga-
tions, 
Lieutenant 
General 
JACK 
BERGMAN of Michigan, and Congress-
woman CHRISSY HOULAHAN of Pennsyl-
vania. 
Both General BERGMAN and Congress-
woman HOULAHAN are veterans them-
selves, and I know their commitment 
to supporting their fellow veterans is 
deeply and strongly felt. I am grateful 
to both of them for their hard work and 
leadership on this bill and for their on-
going service to this country, first in 
uniform and now in Congress. 
As I mentioned in my opening, this 
grant program is named after one of 
east Tennessee’s own, Staff Sergeant 
Parker Gordon Fox. Parker grew up in 
Kingsport, Tennessee, very near to 
where I live, and joined the Army after 
high school graduation. He was only 25 
years old when he died this summer. 
I did not know Parker personally, 
but I have been touched by the loving 
legacy he left behind and the many 
wonderful comments I have heard from 
friends and family. 
My heart is with his family and 
friends today, and I hope that they 
take some comfort in knowing that 
Parker will forever be memorialized 
through this program that will help 
veterans like him across the country 
and, hopefully, save others from the 
deep grief they are now experiencing. 
It is Parker I will be thinking of 
when I vote in support of this bill 
today, and I hope that every one of my 
colleagues will join me. 
In closing, I would like any veteran 
listening today who may be struggling 
with their own thoughts of suicide to 
know that you do not have to struggle 
alone. These are trying times, but free 
and confidential support is available to 
you any time of the day or night by 
calling 1–800–273–8255 and pressing 1, 
texting 
838255, 
or 
visiting 
veteranscrisisline.net. It is okay not to 
be okay. Please reach out for help, if 
you need it, please. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member ROE for his 
kind words, and it is a pleasure to be 
here today to present this package of 
legislation on veteran suicide preven-
tion. 
I do appreciate his mentioning the 
veteran hotline, and I do want to also 
encourage veterans to know that it is 
okay to not be okay and to please call 
the number that Dr. ROE
just an-
nounced. I will try to make sure I re-
peat that later on during our session 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
LAMB), my good friend and vice chair-
man of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his hard work bring-
ing us this bipartisan, bicameral com-
promise that will get things done for 
our Nation’s veterans. 
Madam Speaker, my contributions to 
today’s bill are sort of a mix of old and 
new. We are dramatically increasing 
the investments and availability of 
age-old practices like acupuncture, 
meditation, yoga, nutritional coun-
seling, things that, when you talk to 
the 
veterans 
themselves, 
whether 
younger millennial-age veterans or 
grizzled Vietnam war veterans, they 
will tell you these are some of their fa-
vorite offerings at the local VA and 
some of the practices that make the 
biggest differences for people with 
chronic pain, stress, and anxiety. 
I have heard my Republican col-
leagues make the point many times 
that we have increased the VA’s budget 
without seeing much progress on the 
suicide rate. I agree. That is unaccept-
able. 
These are some of the least costly of-
ferings that the VA has to make: acu-
puncture and chiropractor. They come 
up again and again, and they are a 
minuscule part of the VA’s budget. We 
can make a small increase and make 
an enormous difference. 
We are also investing in another 
great opportunity to do research for 
biomarkers, precision medicine that 
will tell us how we can better treat the 
invisible wounds of war with new tech-
nologies; again, a small down payment 
today for the possibility of much more 
effective and much more cost-effective 
treatment going forward. 
The other important mix of old and 
new that we see today, Madam Speak-
er, is that we are making new invest-
ments—investing in new technology, 
offering new services to veterans—but 
we have done it in an old-fashioned 
way, which is that both sides work to-
gether. 
This will probably be my last chance 
to recognize our ranking member, Dr. 
ROE, before he leaves us at the end of 
this Congress. I just want to say, when 
I came to this Congress 21⁄2 years ago, 
my first committee assignment was on 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee when 
he was chairman. Dr. ROE was kind to 
me from beginning to end, taught me a 
lot about the needs of our Nation’s vet-
erans from the standpoint of a prac-
ticing physician, always with an eye on 
cost, but, above all, on veterans’ well- 
being.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4751 
September 23, 2020 
We thank Dr. ROE for his service, and 
our Nation’s veterans are better off for 
it. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), my good friend, who has served 
together with me for 12 years on the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee and vice 
chairs the committee. There is no 
greater advocate for veterans in this 
country than GUS BILIRAKIS. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for putting forth 
this bill, and I also thank my good 
friend Ranking Member ROE, who does 
an outstanding job. He has really done 
excellent work. It has been an honor to 
serve with him on behalf of our vet-
erans. I thank him so much for his 
service, his continuing service to our 
country and our true American heroes. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of S. 785, the Com-
mander John Scott Hannon Veterans 
Mental Health Care Improvement Act. 
This bill will help prevent veteran 
suicide by expanding access to care, 
services, and support for at-risk indi-
viduals within the VA healthcare sys-
tem and their local communities. It 
contains the IMPROVE Act, a bill by 
my friend General BERGMAN that I was 
proud to support as one of the first co-
sponsors. 
This section creates a grant program 
for community providers to collaborate 
and assist in suicide prevention serv-
ices and is modeled after the bipartisan 
SSVF program, which has been very 
successful in reducing veteran home-
lessness. We need new and innovative 
ways to tackle this tragic problem that 
our veterans are facing today. 
Tragically, 20 servicemembers and 
veterans take their own lives each day, 
not in combat, not by violent crime, 
but due to suicide. We must do every-
thing to stop this, Madam Speaker. 
We know, too, that many of those 20 
per day are not currently using VA 
services. That is why this grant pro-
gram may be particularly helpful, 
since it specifically targets to reach 
those veterans who are actively suici-
dal or at risk of suicide who are not 
current users of the VA health system. 
Madam Speaker, the status quo is 
unacceptable, and none of us should 
stand idly by and allow this epidemic 
of veteran suicide to continue. When 
we called on them, our heroes, these 
servicemembers and veterans answered 
the call to serve. It is time for us to an-
swer the call and support our heroes 
and get them the help that they have 
earned and deserve. 
b 1245 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Nevada (Mrs. LEE), my good 
friend and the chairwoman of the Sub-
committee on Technology Moderniza-
tion, and also the author of this impor-
tant piece of legislation. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I want to thank the chairman for 
bringing this bill in front of the House. 
And I stand today in support of S. 785, 
the Commander John Scott Hannon 
Veterans Mental Health Care Improve-
ment Act. 
In addition to making critical up-
dates related to VA transition assist-
ance, mental healthcare, and care for 
women veterans, this bill also includes 
an important provision that I cham-
pioned here in the House in the form of 
the VA Telehealth Expansion Act, 
which would provide entities with 
grants expanding telehealth capabili-
ties to serve veterans throughout the 
VA. 
We know the stat that over 20 vet-
erans take their life by suicide every 
day, and not one suicide is acceptable. 
And many of those veterans are not ac-
cessing VA care. We know that tele-
health is another venue to allow those 
veterans increased access, whether a 
veteran is homebound, in a rural com-
munity, in a community without ac-
cess to a VA clinic or a hospital, or as 
we have seen now during this pan-
demic, at high risk of dying if they 
catch COVID–19. This pandemic has 
shown us just how critical it is for our 
veterans 
to 
be 
able 
to 
access 
healthcare through telehealth. 
In my home State of Nevada, on the 
week that southern Nevada began re-
sponding to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the number of veterans in the southern 
Nevada healthcare system who had 
telehealth visits, the number was just 
under 150. Fast forward to just the 
week of July 19, we were providing over 
2,000 video visits to veterans in their 
homes via the VA Video Connect. That 
means that the telehealth video visits 
increased by over 1,000 percent. 
It is abundantly clear that telehealth 
has 
provided 
improved 
access 
in 
healthcare for so many veterans, and 
we must continue to invest in the VA’s 
telehealth capacity, and S. 785 does 
just that. 
Madam Speaker, finally, I want to 
give a special thank you also to Con-
gressman ROE, the ranking member, 
for his leadership on this committee. I 
have only been working with him for 
one term, but without a doubt, I want 
to thank him for his commitment to 
our veterans. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the kind 
words and those of Congressman LAMB 
also. It is very much appreciated. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
BERGMAN), from the Upper Peninsula 
where there are more deer than there 
are 
people. 
General 
BERGMAN
has 
served our country as a marine, in pri-
vate business as a pilot, and now as a 
Congressman, and I am indeed fortu-
nate to call him my friend. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, Dr. 
ROE is right, November 15 is fast ap-
proaching here where it is the opening 
of deer season in Michigan, so we anx-
iously await that. 
Madam Speaker, S. 785, the Com-
mander John Scott Hannon Veterans 
Mental Health Improvement Act of 
2019, will save veterans’ lives, and I rise 
in unequivocal support of this legisla-
tion. 
The flame of my passion to end vet-
eran suicide was lit long before I was 
elected to Congress, starting with Viet-
nam to the global war on terror. 
I would like to just take one extra 
opportunity to, again, welcome home 
my fellow veterans from Vietnam. You 
served your country in tough times, 
and we owe you that again and again 
for waiting so long to thank you. 
Because of that, in June 2019, I proud-
ly introduced the Improve Well-Being 
for Veterans Act, which proposed a 
grant program that would allow the VA 
to support the nationwide network of 
community organizations already pro-
viding lifesaving services to local vet-
erans and their families. And it would 
be effective in reaching the 60-plus per-
cent of veterans who die by suicide but 
are not within the VA system of care. 
The goal was to try something dif-
ferent when the status quo was not 
working. That was the driver here 
among all of us who chose to cosponsor 
the Improve Act. 
Within a 6-month period we gained 
over 250 bipartisan cosponsors, gained 
VSO support, and welcomed VA Sec-
retary Wilkie to testify before our 
committee. 
Now, the best possible version of this 
legislation lies at the heart of S. 785, 
which I strongly urge all of my col-
leagues to support. 
For over a decade, and despite bil-
lions of dollars spent within the VA 
trying their hardest, we have heard the 
same statistic over and over again, 20 
veterans die by their own hand every 
day. That is why this new approach and 
innovative approach and a different 
way of looking at things, maybe from 
the outside in, as opposed to the inside 
out, is long overdue. And I am excited 
to stay engaged and work with the ad-
ministration to ensure that it makes a 
difference, especially for the veterans 
in our rural and remote communities 
that are so vulnerable. 
You know, when you come in as a 
freshman—and I love to say that, being 
a freshman at the age of 70 a few years 
ago. I learned as a marine early on, you 
look for good leadership, and I will tell 
you, I found it in Dr. ROE as the Chair-
man of Veterans’ Affairs in my first 
term. 
Madam Speaker, I just wanted to say 
thank you to Dr. ROE for his leadership 
and for dropping the gavel on time 
every committee hearing, because that 
was one of his first bits of guidance to 
us as a committee, and he walked the 
talk. I thank him for his leadership. We 
are going to miss him, but he is not far 
away, and I have his phone number. 
Madam Speaker, I would also like to 
thank the 250-plus bipartisan cospon-
sors, and also both the majority and 
the minority staffs for working so hard 
to make this happen, and the VSOs. I 
thank my co-lead CHRISSY HOULAHAN, 
Senator BOOZMAN, Chairman MORAN,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4752 
September 23, 2020 
Ranking Member TESTER, Chairman 
TAKANO, and, once again, to Dr. ROE. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CISNEROS), my good 
friend and member of the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Com-
mander John Scott Hannon Veterans 
Mental Health Care Improvement Act. 
As this month marks National Sui-
cide Prevention Awareness Month, I 
am grateful the House and Senate Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committees are working 
across the aisle to improve mental 
health services for our veterans. I am 
proud that this package includes my 
bipartisan bill, the STOP Veteran Sui-
cide and Substance Abuse Act. 
We know that too many veterans 
struggling with mental health chal-
lenges, like PTSD, are often also deal-
ing with substance misuse issues and 
the impact of various traumas, includ-
ing military sexual assault. 
Given how common these co-occur-
ring problems are, VA healthcare pro-
viders need evidence-based guidance for 
working with multiple issues all at 
once. My bill ensures that the VA will 
develop and disseminate this clinical 
practice guideline to share best prac-
tices VA-wide. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representative MAST for working with 
me on this bill, and Chairman TAKANO 
for his tireless leadership on this issue. 
And I also want to thank Dr. ROE for 
his years of service to the country, 
both as a doctor, a soldier, and as a 
member of this committee and service 
in the House of Representatives. I 
thank him very much for his friend-
ship, always stopping to say hello. We 
are going to miss him here. But I know 
he will continue his service back in ci-
vilian life, and so I thank him very 
much for his years of service. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN), 
my good friend. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the chairman for bring-
ing this bill to the House. 
Madam Speaker, I rise as well to 
speak in favor of S. 785. 
This comprehensive package of legis-
lation complements the other VA bills 
we considered yesterday and today. I 
want to highlight two pieces of this 
bill, in particular. 
This bill aims to improve the mental 
health medical workforce at the VA. 
The vast majority of veterans who get 
their care at the VA love their experi-
ence, and that is because of the dedi-
cated VA workforce. 
However, we do need to address head- 
on the issue of staffing shortages. Ac-
cording to the most recent VA report, 
there are roughly 50,000 vacant posi-
tions at the VA at any given time, 
many of which are slots for healthcare 
providers. 
This bill would require the VA to cre-
ate a plan to address the staffing of 
mental healthcare providers at its fa-
cilities, and ensure that each medical 
center, like the one in Coatesville in 
my district, is staffed with a suicide 
prevention coordinator. 
This bill also includes the Staff Ser-
geant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Pre-
vention Grant Program, which would 
push funding for suicide prevention 
services out to vetted community orga-
nizations. This is a similar one that 
was proposed in the Improve Act, 
which I was proud to help lead with my 
colleague across the aisle, General 
BERGMAN. 
This will really help us reach the 
millions of veterans who do not use the 
VA for healthcare, or who are more 
comfortable talking about their men-
tal health concerns in a nongovern-
mental setting. It will also ensure that 
these organizations can refer veterans 
to the VA when needed, ensuring that 
there is a warm hand-off, which is so 
critical when someone is in crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I do want to take 
this opportunity to thank Chairman 
TAKANO for his leadership on this criti-
cally important issue. The fact that 
the House is poised to pass not only S. 
785, but also the chairman’s Veterans 
COMPACT Act, and a variety of other 
related bills, is truly a testament to 
his laser-like focus on this issue. 
Representative BROWNLEY, who leads 
the Women Veterans Task Force, also 
has been especially attentive to the 
barriers that women veterans face as 
well. VA research recently found that 
the share of women veterans using the 
VA has grown nearly 15 percent in 10 
years, and we need to ensure that this 
VA is adapting and continuing to be 
the veterans’ first choice for quality 
mental healthcare regardless of gender. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a pleas-
ure to work with General BERGMAN on 
the Improve Act, given our common 
background 
in 
service. 
General 
BERGMAN and I quickly connected last 
year over the importance of ensuring 
that we use all of the tools in our tool-
kit, the VA, community organizations, 
peer support groups, and more, to 
reach veterans in mental health crisis 
where they are and where they feel 
comfortable. 
Madam Speaker, I thank General 
BERGMAN and Ranking Member Dr. ROE 
for their leadership in getting to this 
moment as well. 
I would like to end by saying, it is 
okay to not be okay. If you are experi-
encing a crisis or know someone who 
is, please dial 1–800–273–8255, and press 
1. Again, 1–800–273–8255, and press 1. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, first of all, we have 
heard numerous speakers today speak 
eloquently about the problems we have 
with veteran suicide in this country 
and active duty servicemembers, I 
mean, a horrific number of 20, which 
we have not changed at all in the last 
20 years. 
b 1300 
Two decades and we are still having 
this problem, no matter how much 
money, so it was time to think outside 
the box, which I believe this did. No 
one bill, Madam Speaker, is going to 
solve this problem. 
We have read numbers to call. Look, 
reach out to a friend. If you have a 
friend or a pastor or someone who you 
trust, reach out to them if you are in a 
dark place, and then we will get you 
the help you need. We will get you the 
resources you need because most of 
these decisions, many of these, are im-
pulsive decisions that once they are 
avoided, that person can lead a fruitful, 
bountiful life. 
That is what we want. We want you 
to reach out, and we will get you the 
help you need to get you from the place 
you are to a place of a productive, help-
ful life. 
I thank all the Members, especially 
the chairman, who made this his pri-
mary goal, suicide prevention. I thank 
him for that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
passing S. 785. I thank all of my col-
leagues who worked on this bill on 
both sides of the aisle, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEAN). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
785. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

MENTING ENHANCED LEAD-TIME

tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
5245, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5245, as amended, the Stopping 
Harm 
and 
Implementing 
Enhanced 
Lead-Time for Debts for Veterans Act, 
or the SHIELD for Veterans Act. It 
would create important steps to im-
prove how VA handles overpayments 
made to veterans. The Department’s 
process for collecting overpayments 
that it makes must be fair and reason-
able and consider the potential hard-
ships when an error is discovered. This 
legislation does just that. 
Further, the legislation would make 
overpayments less common by improv-
ing the information available to bene-
ficiaries and modernize how veterans 
can provide updates to VA on their eli-
gibility and status. 
The SHIELD Act was sponsored by 
Chairman CHRIS PAPPAS, who leads our 
Oversight 
and 
Investigations 
Sub-
committee. The bill was developed 
based on hearings Chairman PAPPAS 
held during the session. The sub-
committee also conducted extensive 
oversight of VA collections. 
Finally, the legislation takes into ac-
count the experiences and input of vet-
erans service organizations that help 
veterans navigate what is an overly 
complex current collections process 
that leaves many understandably frus-
trated. 
I also appreciate the bipartisan na-
ture of this bill. Our oversight was con-
ducted with the minority that also of-
fered improvements to the bill, which 
were incorporated into the current lan-
guage. 
I support this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. I thank Mr. 
PAPPAS for sponsoring this important 
legislation and urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 5245, as amended. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5245, as amended, the 
SHIELD for Veterans Act. 
This bill would prohibit the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs from col-
lecting on debts from the Veterans 
Benefits Administration that arise out 
of VA’s failure to process changes in a 
veteran’s entitlement to benefits with-
in certain timeliness standards. 
Veterans should not face financial 
hardships due to delays or errors made 
by VA, nor should Congress accept that 
forgiving debts is a long-term solution. 
Rather, we need to strive to eliminate 
the creation of the debt in the first 
place. 
H.R. 5245 would do that by addressing 
one of the major root causes of debt. 
Certainly, veterans can add depend-
ents to their compensation or pension 
award using VA’s eBenefits online tool, 
and that change is effective imme-
diately. However, VA does not allow 
for the immediate removal of depend-
ents using that same tool.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4754 
September 23, 2020 
Because the removal of a veteran de-
pendent requires a manual review, a 
debt is often created because VA’s 
lengthy review process results in over-
payments to veterans that, by law, VA 
must attempt to recoup. 
I thank my good friend and fellow 
veteran, the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Disability Assistance 
and Memorial Affairs, Congressman 
MIKE BOST from Illinois, for amending 
this bill while it was being considered 
in committee to require VA to estab-
lish a process to allow a veteran to re-
move a dependent through eBenefits as 
seamlessly as they add a dependent. 
This would remove the bureaucratic 
and archaic hurdles of the current 
paper-based process and reduce the cre-
ation of debts. 
The remainder of the bill would 
streamline and improve VBA’s debt 
collection process, so veterans have a 
transparent 
understanding 
of 
their 
rights and how to dispute debts when 
they do occur. 
I thank the chairman and ranking 
member of the Subcommittee on Over-
sight and Investigation, Congressman 
CHRIS PAPPAS from New Hampshire and 
General JACK BERGMAN from Michigan, 
for their work on this bill. I also thank 
Chairman PAPPAS for amending the bill 
that we reported out of the committee 
to address late-identified CBO scoring 
issues. 
I believe that our bipartisan efforts 
produced a policy that is good for vet-
erans and taxpayers alike, and I en-
courage my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this bill today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS), my good 
friend, the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Oversight and Investiga-
tions, and also the author of this im-
portant piece of legislation. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
TAKANO and Ranking Member ROE for 
their words, as well as for their efforts 
to help us get to yes on this important 
piece of legislation. 
I rise in support of H.R. 5245, a bill I 
introduced along with my colleague, 
Congressman MAX ROSE, to fix some 
major problems directly affecting our 
veterans. 
Last year, I heard from one of my 
constituents, New Hampshire veteran 
Jeff Varney, who contacted my office 
for assistance. Jeff, like thousands of 
other veterans across the country, is 
facing tremendous financial hardship 
due to VA errors. 
Jeff was in disbelief when the VA in-
formed him that he needed to repay 
years of benefit overpayments because 
of an apparent error that VA made dec-
ades ago. 
So after a lifetime of service, and 
through no fault of his own, Jeff was 
told he is on the hook for more than 
$11,000, even though VA produced no 
accounting of how these debts were ac-
crued. 
Unfortunately, Jeff is not alone in 
this experience, and too many of our 
veterans are badly surprised when they 
receive letters saying they owe the VA 
money. Sometimes these debts reach 
thousands of dollars. During the hear-
ings held by our Oversight and Inves-
tigations 
Subcommittee, 
we 
heard 
from veterans service organizations 
about the pain and hardship that these 
surprises may bring. 
Last fiscal year, the VA collected $1.6 
billion in debts from veterans. Some-
times these debts result from mistakes 
in disability payouts, changes in eligi-
bility, or simple accounting errors that 
place an undue, unexpected financial 
burden on our veterans. 
It is long past the time to clean this 
issue up. That is why today I am ask-
ing my colleagues to support the 
SHIELD for Veterans Act, which re-
forms VA debt collection processes and 
ensures we are making good on the 
promises we have made to our vet-
erans. 
The SHIELD Act prevents VA from 
collecting overpayments that came as 
a result of their own delays in proc-
essing and requires the VA to provide 
our veterans notice of an overpayment 
and their plan to collect it. It also re-
quires VA to notify veterans of their 
ability to dispute the overpayment or 
request a waiver. 
Under this bill, VA will issue a report 
to Congress on a plan to improve com-
munications with our veterans on the 
debt issue. 
The last thing that my constituent 
needs, and other constituents need, is 
to be hounded by debt collectors, espe-
cially if they have done everything 
right. 
This is a bipartisan, commonsense 
bill, and I really want to thank the ma-
jority and minority staff for their 
work. I thank my ranking member, 
General BERGMAN, as well as Congress-
man BOST, for their contributions to 
helping make this bill better. 
It is simply unacceptable that VA’s 
mistakes or inefficiencies are going to 
hurt the men and women that they are 
supposed to serve 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this commonsense 
bill. It is one of the most common 
things we hear in our office, about an 
outrageous debt that a veteran owes 
back that they didn’t know they owed 
because of a bureaucratic snafu. We 
have all heard these cases. 
I thank my colleagues for bringing 
this up. We should have done this years 
ago. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I, 
too, urge passage of this commonsense 
solution. I very much also appreciate 
the bipartisan agreement that we have 
reached that this is, indeed, a problem 
we should have fixed many years ago. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in passing H.R. 5245, 
as amended, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5245, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from

tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
7105, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7105, as amended, the DELIVER 
Act. 
H.R. 7105, as amended, was intro-
duced by Representative MIKE LEVIN, 
chairman of the Subcommittee on Eco-
nomic Opportunity, in June of this 
year. But the package before us encom-
passes many of the issues his sub-
committee has worked on to reduce 
homelessness and improve employment 
opportunities for veterans. 
This bipartisan package encompasses 
seven bipartisan, bicameral pieces of 
legislation to improve the lives of vet-
erans experiencing hardships. 
First, section 101 of this package in-
cludes 
Chairman 
LEVIN’s 
Homeless 
Veterans Coronavirus Response Act. 
This section includes temporary au-
thorities for the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs to effectively assist vet-
erans during this difficult time. 
Madam Speaker, that means giving 
VA the ability to serve more meals and 
providing blankets, clothing, basic hy-
giene products, and permanent and 
temporary shelter to veterans experi-
encing homelessness. 
The section also allows VA flexibility 
to more quickly pay out grant and per 
diem payments. This means housing 
more veterans more quickly. 
Finally, Mr. LEVIN’s bill authorizes 
VA 
to 
use 
resources 
to 
contract 
healthcare services for veterans in the 
Health Care for Homeless Veterans, or 
HCHV, program during a public health 
emergency. 
b 1315 
These are crucial improvements that 
VA has asked for, and we stand with 
them to deliver this assistance. 
Now, section 102 of this legislation 
represents H.R. 2398 from Representa-
tive 
SCOTT
PETERS. 
His 
Veteran 
HOUSE Act would finally expand HUD- 
VASH to cover veterans with other- 
than-honorable discharges. 
Veterans with other-than-honorable 
discharges make up 3 percent of the 
population, but they compose 15 per-
cent of the homeless veteran popu-
lation. There is no question that this 
commonsense expansion of the pro-
gram would mean fewer homeless vet-
erans, and I thank Representative 
PETERS for his tireless work on this 
section. 
Now, included in section 103 of the 
bill is H.R. 3749, Representative PA-
NETTA’s Legal Services for Homeless 
Veterans Act. This would authorize VA 
to provide grants or enter into coopera-
tive agreements with eligible entities 
that provide legal services to homeless 
veterans and veterans at risk for home-
lessness. 
Madam Speaker, according to com-
munity organizations, legal services 
are one of the top unmet needs for 
homeless veterans. Under this section, 
VA would be required to consult with 
organizations that have experience pro-
viding services to homeless veterans 
when establishing these criteria and re-
quirements, and these grants or coop-
erative agreements would only be 
available to highly rated public or non-
profit entities. 
Additionally, 
Representative 
WILD 
has included legislation to ensure that 
at least 10 percent of the funds made 
available each fiscal year for this grant 
program must be reserved for providing 
legal services to homeless women vet-
erans. 
As we know, women veterans are the 
fastest growing population of homeless 
veterans, and I thank Representative 
PANETTA and Representative WILD for 
their work on this section. 
Section 104 of the underlying bill in-
cludes Representative BEATTY’s legisla-
tion to carry out a gap analysis study 
to determine if VA programs are prop-
erly serving homeless women veterans. 
Section 105 of the legislation rep-
resents bipartisan legislation just in-
troduced by Minority Leader MCCAR-
THY and Chairman LEVIN. Their legisla-
tion, the Reducing Veteran Homeless-
ness Act, would encourage VA to con-
tract out vacant HUD-VASH case-
worker positions, increase the grant 
per diem rates, and allow grant per 
diem participants to gain access to the 
homeless 
management 
information 
systems. This will make our commu-
nity providers more effective at deliv-
ering for their communities. 
Section 105 also includes Representa-
tive 
BROWNLEY’s 
Homeless 
Veteran 
Families Act. 
Many homeless veterans with chil-
dren are unable to obtain transitional 
housing and support assistance through 
the program because providers only re-
ceive payments from the VA for the 
veteran, not their minor dependents. 
This section would authorize VA to pay 
a partial per diem to GPD providers 
supporting our Nation’s homeless vet-
erans with children. 
Finally, this legislation would also 
have VA more accurately track HUD-

VASH case manager vacancies and help 
Congress determine how to more effec-
tively keep the program staffed so that 
it may most effectively serve our Na-
tion’s veterans. 
Sections 201 through 203 represent 
Ranking Member ROE and Chairman 
LEVIN’s Rapid Retraining Assistance 
Program for Veterans. Now, this pro-
gram will train 7,500 veterans who have 
been 
economically 
impacted 
by 
COVID–19, putting their skills and 
knowledge back to work in our econ-
omy. 
We have a commitment to our Na-
tion’s veterans to support them regard-
less 
of 
the 
challenges 
they 
face. 
COVID–19 is no different, and I am 
pleased that we were able to find a way 
to pass concrete employment measures 
for our Nation’s veterans. 
Last but certainly not least, sections 
204 through 207 represent Chairman 
LEVIN’s Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer 
William ‘‘Bill’’ Mulder, Retired, Tran-
sition Improvement Act. 
This section would make much-need-
ed improvements to our servicemem-
bers’ 
transition 
process, 
including 
more accessible transition sites and 
providing grants for organizations to 
assist with resume assistance, inter-
view training, and job recruitment 
training. 
All told, this is one of the most 
meaningful pieces of legislation deal-
ing with economic hardship we will 
have a chance to consider, and I am 
grateful to the countless Members of 
Congress for their hard work to make 
it a reality. 
Our time here is short, so we call on 
our colleagues in the Senate, who have 
also worked on many of these provi-
sions, to send this bill to the President 
before we finish our work this year. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all my 
colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 
7105, as amended. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself as 
much time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7105, as amended, the De-
pendable Employment and Living Im-
provements for Veterans Economic Re-
covery, or DELIVER, Act. 
This bill would help veterans who are 
homeless, provide needed job training 
and education benefits to veterans who 
are unemployed, and support veterans 
who are transitioning out of the mili-
tary and into civilian life. 
It would contain provisions that help 
homeless 
veteran 
service 
providers 
meet the increasing demands associ-
ated with the COVID–19 pandemic, pro-
vide additional flexibility to fund serv-
ices for homeless veterans with chil-
dren, authorize grant funding for legal 
services for homeless veterans, and as-
sist incarcerated veterans who are 
leaving the criminal justice system. 
This bill also contains the text of nu-
merous other bills that have been spon-
sored by Members on both sides of the 
aisle to better support those who have 
served. 
It contains the text of H.R. 8275, the 
Reducing Veteran Homeless Act of 
2020, which is sponsored by Republican 
Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY of California 
and Congressman MIKE LEVIN of Cali-
fornia, the chairman of the Sub-
committee of Economic Opportunity, 
to increase funding for transitional 
housing providers and improve case 
management in the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development—De-
partment of Veterans Affairs Sup-
portive Housing, or the HUD-VASH 
program, which we have used in my 
district numerous times. These efforts 
would help connect homeless veterans 
with stable housing and get them back 
on their own two feet. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to 
Leader MCCARTHY
and Congressman 
LEVIN
for bringing these important 
issues to our attention and working to 
address them. 
The DELIVER Act also contains an-
other bill that was introduced by Re-
publican Leader MCCARTHY, H.R. 5766, 
the VET TEC Expansion Act. 
The VET TEC program was created 
by Leader MCCARTHY in the Forever GI 
Bill in 2017 to support veterans pur-
suing careers in the technology sector 
by providing them with tuition and a 
living stipend as they complete their 
training. 
The VET TEC program is very pop-
ular among veterans, with over 1,100 of 
them completing the program and 
many already finding jobs with an av-
erage starting salary of $60,000 per 
year. That is money well invested when 
you have veterans getting those kinds 
of jobs. 
The VET TEC Expansion Act would 
help streamline processes and author-
ize additional funding for the VET TEC 
program so that even more veterans 
can benefit from it. 
Madam Speaker, I once again thank 
Republican Leader MCCARTHY, who is a 
champion for our Nation’s servicemem-
bers and veterans and never fails to 
support efforts for them to succeed, for 
his work on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, the DELIVER Act 
also contains two provisions that are 
named for Navy SEAL Chief Petty Offi-
cer William ‘‘Bill’’ Mulder, who trag-
ically died by suicide in 2017 after years 
of honorable service to our country. 
The first is H.R. 7111, which I was 
pleased to introduce this summer with 
Congressman 
LEVIN
and 
Senators 
JERRY
MORAN
of Kansas and JON 
TESTER of Montana, the chairman and 
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
As we work to restore the record- 
breaking economy we had in place be-
fore COVID–19, we must do all we can 
to prepare unemployed veterans for 
success in the new post-pandemic econ-
omy. My bill would do that by author-
izing a rapid retraining program for 
veterans who find themselves unem-
ployed as a result of COVID–19. 
Last month, it was estimated that 
there are 560,000 unemployed veterans 
in this country. The retraining pro-
gram my bill would create would put 
those veterans back on track to com-
pete for gainful, long-term employ-
ment opportunities. 
The second provision named after 
Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer Wil-
liam ‘‘Bill’’ Mulder is H.R. 2326, as 
amended, which was introduced by my 
friend Congressman LEVIN
and my 
friends Congressman BILIRAKIS
from 
Florida 
and 
Congressman 
JODEY 
ARRINGTON from Texas, who are, re-
spectively, the current and former Re-
publican leaders of the Subcommittee 
on Economic Opportunity. 
Their bill, which passed the House 
earlier this summer, would improve 
servicemembers’ transition to civilian 
life by authorizing a review of the cur-
riculum of the Transition Assistance 
Program, or TAP program, and author-
izing TAP at off-base locations and 
providing grant funds to community 
organizations that help servicemem-
bers as they transition. 
This bill is a culmination of the work 
the Subcommittee on Economic Oppor-
tunity started last Congress to improve 
TAP. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to 
Congressmen LEVIN, BILIRAKIS, and 
ARRINGTON for their continued work to 
support those transitioning out of the 
military and for including their bill in 
the DELIVER Act today. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank the Na-
tional Coalition for Homeless Veterans 
for their help in crafting the homeless 
veteran provisions in this bill and the 
numerous military and veteran service 
organizations that helped advocate for 
the employment, education, and transi-
tion provisions in the bill. Their stead-
fast advocacy is critical to getting vet-
erans into safe, stable homes and back 
to work, and I am grateful to them for 
their strong partnership that we have 
fostered in my nearly 12 years in Con-
gress. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all 
Members to support the DELIVER Act 
today, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LEVIN), my good friend 
and the chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Economic Opportunity, who is also 
the author of this impressive, com-
prehensive H.R. 7105. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman TAKANO for 
yielding. 
As chair of the House Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs’ Subcommittee on 
Economic Opportunity, and as a Rep-
resentative for tens of thousands of 
veterans around Marine Corps Base 
Camp Pendleton, I strongly believe 
that we have got to do more to support 
those who have served our country. We 
can’t allow men and women who have 
served to fall into homelessness, end up 
without a job, or go without the basic 
services that they deserve. 
Today, we are taking a significant 
step in making sure veterans are no

longer left behind. I am so proud to 
lead the DELIVER Act, a robust, ac-
tion-forward package to help get our 
veterans back on their feet. The legis-
lation includes six of my bipartisan 
bills to help get veterans the housing 
and employment opportunities they de-
serve. 
It includes the Homeless Veteran 
Coronavirus Response Act, a bill I in-
troduced with my friend, Representa-
tive GUS BILIRAKIS—I don’t see Gus 
here, but I am grateful to him—to ex-
pand and strengthen VA services to 
homeless veterans during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
It includes the Veteran HOUSE Act, 
a bill I co-led with my friend Rep-
resentative SCOTT PETERS, also from 
San Diego, to expand the HUD-VASH 
program to homeless veterans dis-
charged under conditions other than 
honorable. 
It includes the Reducing Veteran 
Homelessness Act, a bill I introduced 
with Republican Leader KEVIN MCCAR-
THY to ensure that homeless veterans 
and their families receive the resources 
and services they deserve by filling 
gaps in the HUD-VASH case manage-
ment system. 
It includes the Housing for Women 
Veterans Act, a bill I introduced with 
Representative FITZPATRICK to require 
the VA to complete an analysis of its 
programs that provide assistance to 
women veterans who are homeless to 
identify the areas in which such pro-
grams are failing to meet their needs. 
It includes the Veterans Economic 
Recovery Act, a bill I introduced with 
Ranking Member ROE. 
And we are all going to miss Dr. ROE. 
We are grateful for all that he does. 
That bill will, as Dr. ROE just said, 
create a rapid retraining program for 
unemployed veterans and reservists. 
And it includes the Chief Petty Offi-
cer William ‘‘Bill’’ Mulder Transition 
Improvement Act, a bill I introduced 
with 
my 
friend 
Representative 
ARRINGTON
to make the transition 
process easier for servicemembers re-
turning to civilian life. 
I have said it before, and I will say it 
again: Even one homeless veteran is 
one too many. 
b 1330 
We have a moral obligation to make 
robust Federal investments in pro-
grams to help get veterans off the 
street, and we have got to do a better 
job of ensuring that our Nation’s he-
roes have the housing assistance and 
services they need. Each of the bills 
that we have talked about today will 
make a real difference for the veterans 
I serve and countless others across the 
country. 
You hear a lot about how things in 
Washington are broken and how we 
can’t get a lot done around here, but I 
am 
very 
proud 
of 
the 
bipartisan 
progress we have made today for our 
veterans. I am hopeful the Senate will 
take the bill up quickly and get it on 
the President’s desk. 
I am just so grateful to everybody 
that has been involved, both the Mem-
bers and their staff. It was really a 
wonderful, bipartisan, bicameral effort. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON), a former member of the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee who I had 
the privilege of visiting in his district 
and I know his commitment to our vet-
erans. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
for the record, it is my friend, PHIL 
ROE, who likes to say that there would 
be no Texas if there weren’t a Ten-
nessee. I have to say that in his honor, 
and then I will have to defend my 
honor now when I go back to Texas. 
That is my gift to the gentleman as he 
departs. 
He is a distinguished gentleman and 
statesman and an effective leader for 
our Nation and for our veterans. I 
thank the gentleman for that from the 
bottom of my heart. 
I thank Chairman TAKANO for his ca-
maraderie and our common cause of 
serving the veterans. We served to-
gether when I was in my first term on 
the VA Committee, and he has a pas-
sion for our veterans. While we may 
disagree about things from time to 
time, I respect that about the gen-
tleman and I wish him all the best suc-
cess as we try to do right by those men 
and women who gave up their today so 
we could have our tomorrow. 
Now, to Chairman LEVIN, nothing 
would honor me more than to honor 
the Mulder family and my friend Bill 
Mulder. And for the gentleman to allow 
us to carry his name forward, rep-
resentative of the men and women who 
have served and who have returned 
with honor but with wounds that you 
can’t see and that end up taking their 
lives and taking so much from this 
country because they have so much 
more to offer, I thank the gentleman. 
We need to recognize when things are 
working around here, and I will say 
that any time we can govern for this 
great country and we can do the right 
thing and put our country first, I will 
commend anybody any day and all day. 
So God bless you gentlemen for your 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7105, a package that includes leg-
islation that I, along with Chairman 
LEVIN, introduced to honor Navy SEAL 
Chief Petty Officer Bill Mulder. This 
legislation aims to improve the VA’s 
transition assistance program to help 
our Nation’s servicemembers success-
fully reintegrate back into civilian life 
when they return home from serving 
our Nation. 
Bill Mulder was a friend, a leader, 
and an American hero who, as I men-
tioned, due to the invisible wounds 
that often plague our soldiers when 
they return, tragically ended his own 
life just a few months after retiring 
from serving our Nation with distinc-
tion. 
Our veterans face unique challenges 
when they return home and if we can 
do a better job on the front end, engag-
ing them earlier and providing them 
the 
education, 
training, 
equipping 
them to reintegrate so that we can, on 
the back end, prevent the struggles 
with addiction, unemployment, home-
lessness, suicide, that is the goal here. 
Those are things that disproportion-
ately affect our veterans and we can do 
something about it, and I believe this 
legislation will address that in a mean-
ingful way. 
As we recognize September as Na-
tional Suicide Prevention Awareness 
Month, I can think of no other cause 
more worthy for our support in this 
great body than helping our veterans 
transition to a more productive and 
healthy and fulfilling civilian life after 
they sacrificed so much for our coun-
try. 
By the way, I can’t think of a better 
way to honor Bill Mulder and those 
just like him. So I stand in support. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman 
from Texas an additional 1 minute. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
almost rushed the most important 
part. This is not only a cause worthy of 
our support as a Congress, but it will 
honor men and women just like Bill 
Mulder. I believe if we do it right, and 
if the VA and the Defense Department 
actually implement it right—that is 
the next big hurdle—then we will save 
lives. 
And that is why we got into this gig, 
right? We want to make a difference. 
We want to help our fellow Americans. 
We want to save lives. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
his kind words and comments, and I ap-
preciate his passion for our veterans. 
And I am very pleased that we can 
honor his friend by the naming of the 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, and I am prepared to close. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I am prepared to 
close, and I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
This is a bill that contains a lot of ef-
fort, as you can see, from both sides of 
the aisle, both Republicans and Demo-
crats, and as Mr. ARRINGTON said, try-
ing to do the right thing for our Na-
tion’s heroes. 
I remember in 2008 when I was a can-
didate for Congress, the HUD-VASH 
voucher program was rolled out. I 
didn’t really understand it. It is a pro-
gram that helps homeless veterans. 
And when I got into Congress, I re-
member General Shinseki, who was the 
Secretary at that time, stated that 
during the housing crisis there were 
over 100,000 homeless veterans in Amer-
ica, the wealthiest country in the 
world. I found that shameful. 
His goal was to eliminate homeless-
ness among veterans in the next 6

years. He didn’t achieve that goal, but 
it was a worthy goal. That number now 
is under 40,000, less than that. And, 
hopefully, with this bill that has help 
for families and children in it, that we 
can get these veterans off the street, 
and into productive lives. 
You can see in part of the bill that 
Congressman LEVIN, myself, and leader 
MCCARTHY supported, it takes veterans 
who have lost their jobs and gets them 
skills that they can transition into 
this new economy post-pandemic, and 
has money to take care of their fami-
lies. 
I know the transition assistance pro-
gram that was mentioned. I know when 
I got out of the military, the only 
thing I was worried about was the gate 
of the fort I was in hitting me on the 
backside on the way out. That is how 
much help I got at the end of Vietnam. 
Nobody really said: What are you going 
to do next? 
They just said: You are out of here. 
We had this little helmet, I remem-
ber, when I was in service, with two 
feet coming out from under it. And 
that meant you were short. You had 
less than 100 days left in-country. 
Well, today, we are doing a much bet-
ter job with our transitioning, and we 
are starting to think, when these 
young people go into the military to 
serve our country and our Nation and 
protect us, what are you going to do 
when you transition out? 
In other words, when you go in, start 
thinking about what you are going to 
do when your military career is over. 
This bill will help us get to that. I am 
very proud to encourage all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to say 
that this is a tremendously comprehen-
sive bill. It represents the tremendous 
work of Members from both sides of the 
aisle. 
I have to say that I am recalling at 
this very moment a woman veteran 
who drove all the way from Los Ange-
les into my district to a townhall 
meeting where she first made me aware 
of the issue of veterans with children 
not having enough money, not enough 
benefits to be able to get into homeless 
housing, and I am so pleased that the 
bill by Ms. BROWNLEY to address that 
issue is in this piece of legislation. 
I just urge all of my colleagues to 
pass H.R. 7105, as amended, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the DELIVER Act, a bipar-
tisan veterans legislative package that in-
cludes two bills that I have introduced this 
Congress, the VET TEC Expansion Act and 
the Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act of 
2020. 
I believe that a nation’s character can be 
judged by how well it treats its veterans when 
they complete their service and return home. 
Providing veterans with flexible education ben-
efits to meet current workforce needs and pro-
tecting our most vulnerable veterans from 
homelessness is the least that we can do as 
a country to repay our debt of gratitude. 
The VET TEC Expansion Act, which I intro-
duced with my colleague from California, Ro 
Khanna, builds upon the success of the exist-
ing VET TEC pilot program, which was cre-
ated by the original VET TEC Act that I intro-
duced and which President Trump signed into 
law in 2017 as part of a broader bipartisan 
veterans bill. Upon realizing the potential that 
non-traditional, ‘‘nanodegree’’ educational pro-
grams have for our veterans after visiting such 
a program in 2017, I discovered that GI Bill 
benefits did not cover the cost of enrolling in 
these types of programs, which is why I intro-
duced the VET TEC Act. 
The VET TEC pilot program began accept-
ing veteran applications in May 2019, and in 
seeking to keep the program aligned with its 
mission to provide veterans with access to 
technology-oriented and industry-responsive 
educational courses, I introduced the VET 
TEC Expansion Act just under one year after 
the pilot’s official launch. This bill would allow 
the VA to accept more course providers into 
the VET TEC pilot program, expand VET TEC 
pilot program eligibility to include certain 
servicemembers who are starting the transition 
to civilian life—so they may get a jumpstart on 
obtaining new skills that can help them secure 
a job—and would allow the VA to accept edu-
cation providers that offer part-time courses, 
such as night classes, into the pilot program. 
All of these provisions were developed in 
consultation with feedback from veteran orga-
nizations and I am confident that these 
changes will allow the VA to provide even 
more veterans with access to the most up-to- 
date, non-traditional educational courses pos-
sible. The VET TEC pilot program is incredibly 
popular, so I am pleased that the DELIVER 
Act also authorizes $30 million in additional 
annual funding for this pilot program until its 
expiration in Fiscal Year 2023. This funding in-
crease appropriately responds to the current 
overwhelming demand from veterans who are 
seeking to participate in non-traditional edu-
cational courses that prepare them for employ-
ment in our dynamic, technology-centric econ-
omy. An August 2020 VA report to Congress 
recently found that thousands of veterans who 
applied to participate in a VET TEC-approved 
course received a ‘‘Certificate of Eligibility’’ to 
participate beginning on October 1, 2020, the 
start of the 2021 Fiscal Year, as VET TEC’s 
popularity caused it to run out of funding in its 
first pilot year. To me, this is a strong testa-
ment to the demand for flexible educational 
benefits from our nation’s student veterans. 
The Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act of 
2020, which I introduced with my colleague 
from California, MIKE LEVIN, just last week, 
provides solutions to address issues that 
homeless providers have raised with me in re-
cent years. The successful HUD-VA Sup-
portive Housing Program (or HUD-VASH Pro-
gram) has long been plagued by understaffing 
of case managers, which prevents supportive 
housing vouchers allocated through the pro-
gram from reaching veterans in need. 
My legislation requires the VA to contract 
out HUD-VASH case manager services to 
community experts when these VA case man-
ager positions remain unfilled for a long period 
of time and HUD-VASH housing vouchers in 
the region remain unutilized. It also modern-
izes the VA’s Grant and Per Diem program so 
that homeless providers that participate in this 
program receive pay that is based on local or 
regional conditions rather than a standard 
across-the-board rate, in order to prevent pro-
viders operating in parts of the country with 
higher living costs from having to reduce serv-
ices. 
I would like to thank Subcommittee Chair-
man LEVIN, Committee Ranking Member PHIL 
ROE and the members of the House Veterans 
Affairs Committee for ensuring that our na-
tion’s veterans receive the supportive services 
that they deserve by including these two 
pieces of legislation in the DELIVER Act. Ac-
cordingly, I ask my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to join me in supporting this bill so 
that we may better serve the veterans who 
have so valiantly served our country. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7105, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to provide flexibility 
for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in 
caring for homeless veterans during a 
covered public health emergency, to di-
rect the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
to carry out a retraining assistance 
program for unemployed veterans, and 
for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

VENTION, ACCESS TO CARE, AND 
TREATMENT ACT OF 2020 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the

prevention for veterans, and care and

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
8247, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 8247, the Veterans Comprehensive 
Prevention, Access to Care, and Treat-
ment Act, or Veterans COMPACT Act. 
While passing S. 785, the Commander 
John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental 
Health Care Improvement Act can be 
viewed as a great success, no single 
piece of legislation can comprehen-
sively prevent the tragedy of veteran 
suicide. 
We must continually find and work 
to address gaps in prevention and care 
for 
veterans, 
especially 
those 
at 
heightened risk for suicide, including 
women veterans, veterans who have re-
cently separated from the military 
service, veterans who haven’t used VA 
healthcare recently, and veterans in 
acute crisis. 
The COMPACT Act contains nine 
provisions to further enhance veteran’s 
mental health and well-being and pre-
vent deaths by suicide. 
Madam Speaker, the House Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs approaches 
suicide prevention legislation within 
the CDC’s public health framework, 
emphasizing upstream prevention, tar-
geted interventions for those veterans 
at higher risk, and emergency care for 
those in suicidal crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4768 
September 23, 2020 
The COMPACT Act includes my pro-
vision to remove financial barriers and 
ensure that veterans in acute suicidal 
crisis or at imminent risk of self-harm 
will receive emergency stabilization 
care and never see a bill for it. 
COMPACT also offers two provisions 
designed to better understand the par-
ticular needs of women veterans by di-
recting the VA to report on women vet-
erans’ healthcare usage and the spe-
cific program needs of women veterans 
experiencing homelessness and housing 
insecurity. 
It also includes two provisions aimed 
at including veterans’ family members 
with veterans’ permission in education 
programs to better support their vet-
erans. When we take care of families, 
we also take care of veterans. 
Madam Speaker, this bill also man-
dates that VA report back to Congress 
on the details of Solid Start, a rel-
atively new VA approach to contacting 
and supporting veterans who have re-
cently separated from the military. 
This is a known high-risk period for 
suicide among veterans. 
COMPACT will ensure that veterans 
who haven’t used VA healthcare re-
cently get a reminder to come back in 
for VA services, so they don’t inadvert-
ently lose eligibility for some of those 
services. 
Because we know that VA police play 
important roles in keeping everyone 
safe on VA campuses, this bill requires 
new annual trainings to make sure 
that all VA police officers are familiar 
with mental health challenges and 
competent in crisis deescalation tech-
niques. 
Madam Speaker, finally, the COM-
PACT Act sets up an interagency task 
force to look at increasing veterans’ 
access to the outdoors and, in par-
ticular, use of our public lands for heal-
ing and recreation. 
I want to emphasize that the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs is al-
ways willing to work in a bipartisan 
and bicameral way to advance policies 
to support veterans. And to that end, 
we sought and incorporated feedback 
from stakeholders and we worked hard 
to find consensus with our House and 
Senate colleagues. 
Madam Speaker, even though the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs declined 
to appear and testify before us in the 
House on this bill, we incorporated its 
last-minute technical suggestions in 
the spirit of collaboration. And because 
of their commitment to finding com-
mon ground and for working with the 
House to reach an agreed-upon bipar-
tisan, bicameral piece of legislation, I 
want to thank Senators MORAN and 
TESTER, and Dr. ROE and their staffs 
for their tireless efforts in helping 
craft this bill. Because of their work, 
we are providing VA with additional 
tools and resources to reduce veteran 
suicide. 
We should be clear that while we will 
pass two important pieces of legisla-
tion today to address the tragedy of 
veteran suicide, this certainly does not 
mark the end of Congress’ obligation. 
We can and we must do more. 
Madam Speaker, we must implement 
key recommendations from the White 
House PREVENTS task force related 
to lethal means safety and community 
provider training. We must increase 
VA’s outreach to and care for minority 
and underserved veterans. 
We stand ready to move this nego-
tiated bill forward and immediately 
get back to work. My hope is that the 
Senate stands ready as well. Politics 
must never come before the debt we 
owe our veterans. 
Before I say my final words in this 
opening piece about this legislation, I 
want to just again reiterate to our vet-
erans out there who may be experi-
encing a crisis or who know a veteran 
who may be experiencing a crisis, to 
please call the Veterans Crisis Line at 
1–800–273–8255 and press 1. As Dr. ROE 
said earlier today, it is okay not to be 
okay. 
Again, 1–800–273–8255 and press 1, or 
text 838255. 
For deaf or hard of hearing, please 
call 1–800–799–4889. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in support of H.R. 
8247, as amended, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1345 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 8247, as amended, the Veterans 
Comprehensive Prevention, Access to 
Care, and Treatment Act of 2020. The 
Veterans COMPACT Act is sponsored 
by my friend and fellow leader of the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Chair-
man MARK TAKANO from California. I 
thank the chairman for introducing 
this bill, and I stand with him today in 
full support of it. 
This bill is a result of bipartisan, bi-
cameral negotiations with Senators 
JERRY MORAN from Kansas and JON 
TESTER from Montana, the chairman 
and ranking member of the Senate 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and I 
thank them for their efforts as well. 
To increase access to care to vet-
erans at imminent risk for suicide, the 
Veterans COMPACT Act would require 
VA to cover the cost of emergent sui-
cide care for veterans, including those 
with other than honorable discharges 
who are in crisis. 
To make VA campuses safer places of 
care and support for veterans in need, 
it will require the VA police officers to 
receive regular training in suicide pre-
vention. 
To ensure that veterans at risk of 
suicide receive appropriate help at 
home and their families are recognized 
and supported for the vital roles they 
play in the recovery process, it would 
expand training and support for family 
members and caregivers of veterans 
with mental health disorders. 
To support veterans during the vul-
nerable period of time in which they 
transition out of the military and into 
their civilian lives, the bill would cre-
ate 
a 
pilot 
program 
to 
allow 
transitioning servicemembers to share 
information about the challenges and 
stresses of transition and the benefits 
and services available through VA and 
other governmental and private-sector 
entities with their loved ones. 
To encourage veterans to engage in 
the VA healthcare system and take full 
advantage of the services VA provides, 
it would require VA to conduct out-
reach to veterans who have not been 
seen by VA within the prior 2 years. 
Remember, Madam Speaker, that over 
60 percent of those veterans who com-
mit suicide have not been in a VA 
healthcare facility in the last 2 years. 
To improve care to the growing num-
ber of women who are serving in uni-
form and seeking care as veterans, it 
will require VA to produce an annual 
report on women veterans’ use of VA 
care and a gap analysis of the programs 
that serve women veterans who are 
homeless or at risk. 
The bill also contains the text of 
H.R. 2435, the Accelerating Veterans 
Recovery Outdoors Act, which is spon-
sored by my friend, Congressman CHRIS 
SMITH from New Jersey, who is a senior 
Member here. Congressman SMITH is 
my friend, the former chairman of this 
committee, and a longtime champion 
of our Nation’s veterans. His bill would 
create a task force to examine what op-
portunities may exist for veterans to 
use our country’s bountiful national 
parks and other beautiful outdoor 
spaces to improve their health and 
wellness. As the saying goes, nature, 
time, and patience are the three great 
physicians. 
As an avid outdoorsman myself, I 
know the healing benefits that nature 
offers, and I am grateful to Congress-
man SMITH for his work to increase 
outdoor recreation for our Nation’s 
veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I hope all of my col-
leagues will join me in supporting the 
Veterans COMPACT Act, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. KELLY) to speak on 
H.R. 8247. 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues 
to support H.R. 8247, the Veterans 
COMPACT Act. This important pack-
age will help veterans struggling with 
mental health and slow the alarming 
rate of veteran suicides in this coun-
try. 
This package includes my bipartisan 
bill, H.R. 7747, which implements re-
porting requirements for the VA Solid 
Start program. The Solid Start pro-
gram is a new transitional program de-
signed to contact veterans three times 
during the first year after departing 
military service. 
Veterans are often at their most vul-
nerable as they transition to civilian 
life. From waking up to a less struc-
tured day to having to navigate the

often-frustrating VA benefits system, 
veterans 
can 
feel 
alone 
or 
over-
whelmed. But we can change that. 
The proactive engagement from this 
program has already produced positive 
results. In its first year, VA represent-
atives have helped more than 750 vet-
erans apply for disability benefits, and 
several veterans in crisis were imme-
diately connected to suicide prevention 
services. 
We need to build on that success. 
Sometimes all it takes is a friendly 
voice on the other end of the line to 
make a difference. 
I hope all of my colleagues will join 
me in supporting the Veterans COM-
PACT Act so we can give our veterans 
the support they deserve. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SMITH). My friend is the previous chair-
man of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee and a great advocate of our Na-
tion’s heroes. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. First of 
all, Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairman TAKANO. I give a special 
thanks to him and the ranking mem-
ber, Dr. ROE, for including my bipar-
tisan bill, H.R. 2435, the Accelerating 
Veterans Recovery Outdoors Act, into 
the COMPACT Act that is before the 
House today. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
introduced 
17 
months ago, I am especially grateful 
for the work of my good friend and col-
league, ADAM SMITH from Washington, 
the lead Democrat cosponsor, and all 
135 cosponsors of this legislation. 
I give special thanks to the veterans 
service organizations, outdoor groups, 
and a big, big shout-out to the Sierra 
Club for the groundbreaking work that 
they have done to advance outdoor 
recreation as an extraordinarily effec-
tive form of healing for veterans suf-
fering from PTSD and other psycho-
logical consequences from their serv-
ice. 
The legislation requires the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to establish 
an interagency task force on the use of 
public lands to provide medical treat-
ment and therapy to veterans through 
outdoor recreation. Specifically, the 
task force duties include, first, to iden-
tify opportunities to formalize coordi-
nation between the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, public lands agencies, 
and partner organizations regarding 
the use of public lands or other outdoor 
spaces for health and wellness for vet-
erans; second, to identify barriers that 
exist to providing veterans with oppor-
tunities 
for 
health 
and 
wellness 
through the use of outdoor recreation 
on public lands or other outdoor 
spaces; and, third, to develop rec-
ommendations to better facilitate the 
use of public lands or other outdoor 
spaces for promoting wellness and fa-
cilitating the delivery of health care 
and therapy for veterans. 
After an exhaustive—hopefully, an 
exhaustive—analysis, it will provide 
recommendations to Congress within a 
year. 
Madam Speaker, research has in-
creasingly shown that outdoor recre-
ation can be an effective form of treat-
ment and healing for veterans. While 
many nonprofit organizations, VSOs, 
and other private companies have used 
the outdoors to help heroes to heal, 
providing greater coordination among 
key Federal agencies will open up new 
opportunities for veterans on public 
lands and other outdoor spaces. 
Blake, Madam Speaker, is a combat- 
wounded veteran who served in Iraq. 
By the time he was 20, Blake was suf-
fering severe depression, anxiety, and 
post-traumatic 
stress 
disorder. 
He 
made three visits to the VA psychiatric 
wards and a substance abuse rehab. But 
it was a backpacking trip led by the Si-
erra 
Club 
Military 
Outdoors 
that 
changed his entire perspective. 
With growing hope, Blake began par-
ticipating in backpacking trips to Yo-
semite, Ansel Adams, and Big Bend. He 
says the shared experiences in the out-
doors taught him purpose, self-reli-
ance, and the healing powers of nature. 
Blake reports that ‘‘in every Texas 
sunrise in the desert or a sunset next 
to an alpine lake, I found more beauty 
and serenity than I thought existed. I 
found camaraderie with other veterans 
in sharing our stories on the trail. The 
darkness of what I had experienced 
couldn’t compare to the light I saw in 
watching a trout swim in the Merced 
River with Half Dome looming nearby. 
And when the depression, anxiety, and 
everything else that comes with PTSD 
creeps back into my life, I know just 
what to do: Strap on a pack and get 
outside.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
the legislation, and I thank my friends 
for including it in this bill. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
In closing, first of all, I want to 
thank the chairman for his persistence 
in getting this bill done and including 
Congressman SMITH. It is wonderful. 
I was out at Walter Reed a number of 
years ago. They were talking about 
PTSD, and I asked them: Well, do they 
like to fish? Would that help? 
Chris said: Sure. 
I said: Well, I have got some of the 
best trout streams in the world in my 
district. 
They said: Well, are they going to 
catch any fish? 
I said: They also have a fish hatchery 
in my district, and I guarantee they 
are going to catch fish. 
We had a wonderful event, and it does 
help. There is no question about it. 
I was just thinking, when Congress-
man SMITH
said that, almost every 
weekend, I am on the Appalachian 
Trail, which is very near my home, or 
other hiking trails with fellow vets out 
hiking. It is exactly as he described. It 
is therapeutic. I would encourage ev-
eryone to do it, especially now that we 
can begin to get out in this pandemic. 
I know that has kept a lot of people in 
their homes where they can’t get out 
and they feel trapped. Again, reach 
out. 
Again, I thank the chairman for his 
work on making this an important 
issue of the committee this year, and I 
appreciate his leadership on that. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I thank the ranking member for his 
assistance and partnership in getting 
COMPACT to the finish line. I cer-
tainly thank Chairman SMITH for his 
contribution. I agree with the chair-
man that the great outdoors—the tre-
mendous resources that we have in our 
country of our national parks—should 
be made more available and accessible 
to our veterans who are suffering the 
unseen wounds of war. So I thank the 
gentleman so much for his contribu-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I want to urge all of 
my colleagues to support H.R. 8247. I 
want to thank the staff; my own staff 
director, Ray Kelley; and the tremen-
dous expertise that we brought on and 
just the tremendous focus that they 
were able to achieve during the past 18 
months. 
This is, indeed, a huge milestone 
today, to be standing here and to see 
H.R. 8247 be passed before the House 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 8247, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary and Homeland Security, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 8247, the ‘‘Veterans Com-
prehensive Prevention, Access to Care, and 
Treatment Act of 2020’’, which makes numer-
ous improvements relating to Department of 
Veterans Affairs services offered during the 
transition period for veterans, suicide preven-
tion for veterans, in addition to care and serv-
ices for women veterans. 
First and foremost, I want to thank all of our 
armed servicemen and women for their self-
less dedication to our protection every day. 
This country owes you all a great debt for 
your sacrifice. 
It is no secret that the transition from active 
duty to civilian life poses numerous challenges 
and potential triggers to veterans. 
We have all heard the saying ‘‘it takes a vil-
lage’’. 
Providing support to veterans who have 
mental illnesses is no different. 
That is why I appreciate this bill’s hands-on 
approach to involve loved ones in providing 
care to veterans who are struggling with their 
mental health. 
For example, this bill creates a pilot pro-
gram on information sharing of the assistance 
and benefits available to veterans between the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and des-
ignated loved ones. 
This legislation also stipulates that the VA to 
carry out an education program for family 
members and caregivers of veterans with 
mental health disorders.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4770 
September 23, 2020 
It is well known that outreach continues to 
be a major obstacle for VA prevention efforts. 
H.R. 8247 seeks to address this issue by 
requiring the VA to contact veterans by mail, 
telephone, or email to urge them to come in 
for a VA exam, so that they remain ‘‘actively 
enrolled’’ in the VA health care system. 
These continuous check-ins are also key to 
addressing the startling suicide rates among 
veterans. 
For instance, veterans are 1.5 times more 
likely to die by suicide than Americans who 
never served in the military. 
For female veterans, the risk factor is 2.2 
times more likely to die by suicide. 
In 2017 alone, 6,100 veterans died by sui-
cide. 
H.R. 8247 improves upon the status quo of 
care for veterans with regards to mental health 
by promoting coordination between the VA 
and the Suicide Prevention Coordinator at the 
nearest VA facility. 
This will help in determining if the individual 
in crisis is eligible for other VA benefits and 
make referrals for appropriate follow-on care. 
Madam Speaker, I also applaud the bill’s 
designation of the VA as the primary payer. 
With this provision, we are not only remov-
ing the out-of-pocket costs for veterans with 
respect to emergent mental health, but we are 
also removing a barrier that prevents so many 
from seeking help. 
Veterans are truly heroes walking among 
us. 
Their sacrifices, and those of their families, 
allow civilians to enjoy the benefits of our free-
dom without a second thought. 
Without the brave efforts of all the soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guards-
men and women and their families, our coun-
try would not live so freely. 
I offer my deepest gratitude to our nation’s 
troops and reservists, their families, and the 
19.2 million veterans, including 28,227 in my 
own district. 
Nine in ten military families believe the pub-
lic does not understand or appreciate their 
sacrifices. 
Today, Congress has the opportunity to 
show its appreciation for our military personnel 
by voting for H.R. 8247. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8247, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

EQUAL 
ACCESS 
TO 
CONTRACEP-
TION FOR VETERANS ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3798) to amend title 38, 
United States Code, to provide for limi-
tations on copayments for contracep-
tion furnished by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3798 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equal Ac-
cess to Contraception for Veterans Act’’. 
SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON COPAYMENTS FOR CON-
TRACEPTION. 
Section 1722A(a)(2) of title 38, United 
States Code, is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘to pay’’ and all that fol-
lows through the period and inserting ‘‘to 
pay—’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraphs: 
‘‘(A) an amount in excess of the cost to the 
Secretary for medication described in para-
graph (1); or 
‘‘(B) an amount for any contraceptive item 
for which coverage under health insurance 
coverage is required without the imposition 
of any cost-sharing requirement pursuant to 
section 2713(a)(4) of the Public Health Serv-
ice Act (42 USC 300gg–13(a)(4)).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and insert 
extraneous material on H.R. 3798, as 
amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 3798, as amend-
ed, eliminates copayments on contra-
ceptive items at the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, ensuring that no vet-
erans, especially women veterans, face 
economic barriers to a critical compo-
nent of preventative healthcare. 
I thank Congresswoman BROWNLEY 
for introducing this bill and for her ef-
forts as chair of the Subcommittee on 
Health and the Women’s Veterans Task 
Force. 
Contraception is an essential part of 
healthcare, and more than 99 percent of 
women have used birth control at some 
point in their lives. Women veterans 
represent the fastest growing popu-
lation 
of 
veterans 
accessing 
care 
through VA, and many are of reproduc-
tive age. 
Contraception is widely available at 
VA, and veterans enrolled at VA can 
obtain oral contraceptives, shots, skin 
patches, vaginal rings, and long-acting 
reversible contraceptives, such as im-
plants or intrauterine devices or IUDs. 
In addition, the VA pharmacy dis-
penses 
over-the-counter 
contracep-
tives, including condoms and emer-
gency contraception. 
Requiring a copay for contraception 
creates an unnecessary economic bar-
rier to preventative healthcare. Women 
veterans are more likely to live in pov-
erty 
than 
male 
veterans, 
and 
transgender veterans are more likely 
to live in poverty than cisgender vet-
erans. Even a small copay can be insur-
mountable for someone trying to make 
ends meet. 
Madam Speaker, passing this bill is 
especially critical during the pan-
demic. During times of crisis, such as 
natural disaster and pandemics, the 
rate of unplanned pregnancy increases. 
When so many Americans are experi-
encing economic hardship, their access 
to healthcare should be something that 
they do not have to worry about. This 
bill has wide VSO support and is also 
supported by the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. 
I, again, thank Ms. BROWNLEY for her 
leadership on this issue. I thank Dr. 
ROE and the minority staff for working 
with us on this bill, and I look forward 
to working with our Senate counter-
parts to get it passed into law before 
the 116th Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 3798, as 
amended, the Equal Access to Contra-
ception for Veterans Act. 
This bill is sponsored by Congress-
woman JULIA
BROWNLEY
from Cali-
fornia. Congresswoman BROWNLEY
is 
the chairwoman of the Subcommittee 
on Health and the bipartisan Women’s 
Veterans Task Force, and I am grateful 
for her hard work and steadfast com-
mitment to improving care for all the 
men and women who have served our 
Nation in uniform. 
The Equal Access to Contraception 
Act would prevent the Department of 
Veterans Affairs from charging copay-
ments for contraceptive items and 
services that veterans receive in the 
VA. This would create parity between 
the VA healthcare system and the rest 
of the healthcare industry, which al-
ready exempts prescriptions for contra-
ception 
from 
cost-sharing 
require-
ments. 
Prior to coming to Congress, I spent 
30 years in private practice as a board- 
certified OB/GYN physician, so I know 
firsthand the importance of reproduc-
tive care and regular access to contra-
ception. I am proud to sponsor this bill 
today to increase access to contracep-
tion for the growing number of women 
who are volunteering for the military 
and enrolling in the VA healthcare sys-
tem following their brave service. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BROWNLEY), my good friend, 
the chairwoman of the Subcommittee 
on Health, and also the author of this 
important piece of legislation. 
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4771 
September 23, 2020 
that women veterans have access to 
the same contraception coverage as 
women currently serving in the mili-
tary and on the same basis of women 
who receive private healthcare. 
I thank the chairman for working 
with me to advance this legislation, 
and I am proud that my bill passed the 
committee with broad bipartisan sup-
port. 
As you may know, because of the Af-
fordable Care Act, all women using ci-
vilian health insurance may access 
basic contraceptive services, like the 
pill or an IUD, without a copay. 
Last year, the Access to Contracep-
tion for Servicemembers and Depend-
ents Act passed with overwhelming bi-
partisan support as part of the annual 
National Defense Authorization Act to 
ensure that TRICARE also provides 
this basic health benefit to service-
members and their dependents. While 
this was an important step, women vet-
erans currently do not receive this ben-
efit from the VA. 
Clearly, we need to make sure all 
women who have served our country 
receive the same care. My bill will fix 
this inequity. 
The benefits of contraception are 
widely recognized. Choosing when or if 
to have a family is essential to wom-
en’s health and to their economic secu-
rity. 
Today, there are 2 million women 
veterans living in the United States, 
and women comprise the fastest grow-
ing subpopulation of both the military 
and veteran populations. Yet, many of 
their health needs go unaddressed in a 
VA system that has not evolved to eq-
uitably serve a rapidly changing popu-
lation. 
As the chairwoman of the Women’s 
Veterans Task Force and chair of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs’ Subcommittee 
on Health, members of the task force 
and I have worked to identify dispari-
ties in healthcare for women veterans 
and, where necessary, introduce, advo-
cate for, and pass legislation that 
eliminates those gaps. 
Mr. Speaker, our veterans have sac-
rificed so much for us and our country. 
It is way past time that we address this 
inequity and fix this glaring gap in 
care of our women veterans. I urge my 
colleagues to support our women vet-
erans and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3798. 
Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I, too, 
would just like to publicly acknowl-
edge my gratitude to Dr. ROE. When 
the Speaker says the ‘‘gentleman from 
Tennessee,’’ I believe he truly is a gen-
tleman in the eyes, I think, of all Mem-
bers of Congress and, certainly, par-
ticularly mine. 
He is a great storyteller that under-
scores the point that he is making at 
all times. There is no question that his 
leadership and his advocacy for our 
veterans, both men and women, are un-
touchable and unwavering. I would say 
how much I have enjoyed working with 
him on the Committee of Veterans’ Af-
fairs, and I know that he will be missed 
by the entire House, but sorely missed 
within the Committee of Veterans’ Af-
fairs and our daily work there. 
I thank him for all that he has done. 
Whatever his next chapter is in his life, 
I hope that he and his new bride enjoy 
every minute of it. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I very, very much ap-
preciate the incredibly kind words. 
Some of those stories are probably 
even true that I tell. 
Mr. Speaker, I would take a point of 
personal privilege before I close. This 
will probably be the last time I am 
down here to speak on the House floor 
as the ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs before this 
Congress adjourns in January. 
Mr. Speaker, what an honor and 
privilege it has been. And you cannot 
be successful—and I think the chair-
man will also emphasize this—without 
an incredible staff. I have been so 
blessed with very, very, very com-
petent people on both sides of the aisle. 
And it has been fun working with Ray 
and the gentleman’s staff, and I thank 
him for that. They have always been 
respectful, and I have appreciated that. 
Mr. Speaker, you know it is probably 
time to retire from Congress when you 
have delivered one of your staff mem-
bers, which I have, that is on our side. 
Mr. Speaker, it is not about us. It is 
about the veterans that we serve—all 
of us in this incredible body. How many 
times in your life do you get an oppor-
tunity to really do good for people? 
I will tell you what has influenced 
me. I grew up in a military town, Fort 
Campbell, Kentucky, Clarksville, Ten-
nessee, where the 101st Airborne is. My 
scoutmaster, First Sergeant Thomas E. 
Thayer, was killed in 1965 in Vietnam. 
He left four children. I saw what it did 
to that family. I have never forgotten 
that. 
After my service was over—I served 
in Korea in 1973–1974 in the Second In-
fantry Division—I came back home, 
saw what happened to our Nation’s vet-
erans, how they were treated. That has 
changed. 
I am thankful that this country no 
longer treats the veterans like they did 
my Vietnam brothers and sisters who 
served. 
We had the opportunity in this com-
mittee, in a bipartisan way, as I said, 
to make a difference. In the last Con-
gress, we passed the Accountability 
and Whistleblower Protection bill; the 
Appeals Modernization that has helped 
so many people; the Forever GI Bill, 
and I used the GI bill when I got out of 
the military, and it helped me as a 
young family, and I know how it trans-
formed this country after World War II; 
the MISSION Act, and I could go on 
and on—the bills we passed yesterday 
and the bills we passed today, and we 
will pass Congresswoman BROWNLEY’s 
bill in just a moment here. 
I got an email last week. We get 
these all the time. We talked about the 
blue water Navy for, I don’t know, 10 
years, I guess. I get this email from a 
widow, who is a veteran, whose hus-
band died in his late forties with com-
plications of Agent Orange. He served 
on a service ship outside Vietnam that 
offloaded Agent Orange. 
Finally, after all these years and the 
work, Mr. Speaker, we got this passed 
in February, I think, of 2019. She got 
backpay and a stipend for her and her 
family for the service that her husband 
had done. She was a veteran who had 
served, too, but not there. I thank the 
entire body for doing that because you 
made a difference in this veteran’s life. 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the 
body, the committee, all the people 
who have worked, and I certainly want 
to support Ms. BROWNLEY’s bill and her 
kind words—I much appreciate that— 
and I encourage all Members to vote 
for this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, before I conclude my re-
marks on Ms. BROWNLEY’s important 
piece of legislation on making contra-
ception available on the same basis as 
the Department of Defense, I, too, want 
to add my words of praise to my col-
league and my partner in the work in 
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
Ranking Member Dr. PHIL ROE. 
Mr. Speaker, he has so much to point 
to, the proud list of accomplishments: 
The Blue Water Navy bill was some-
thing that had a chain of ownership. I 
happened to be the last one on the 
chain. I know that the gentleman put a 
lot of work into that. 
Even as we approach the month of 
October, we know that, finally, they 
are going to implement the caregiver 
portion of that bill. What a tremendous 
expansion of caregiver benefits that 
were previously only available to post- 
9/11 veterans. I lament that it took 
that long, but it is here. 
Let’s also think about the tremen-
dous progress we made on homeless-
ness. It is not done, and it is not over, 
but we made tremendous strides na-
tionwide in reducing veteran homeless-
ness. We just passed today a very com-
prehensive bill to deal with the re-
mains of homelessness, which remains 
a very serious problem in my own 
home State of California. 
Mr. Speaker, Dr. ROE
has helped 
shape our progress on veterans home-
lessness in so many areas of policy re-
lating to our Nation’s veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I join all of my col-
leagues in saying that the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs will miss him. 
I know his storytelling, but I learned 
late this year of his affection for the 
late folksinger John Prine. I know Dr. 
ROE plays the guitar, and I hope that 
before he leaves, he will regale us at 
some point with either one of his songs 
or one of the songs that he likes to 
play on that guitar. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in passing H.R. 3798, 
as amended, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ergy user in the United States. 
(2) Reducing energy and water use in Federal 
facilities— 
(A) saves taxpayer dollars; 
(B) reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the 
Federal sector; and 
(C) increases employee comfort and produc-
tivity.

to— 
(A) develop goals for energy and water use re-
duction in Federal facilities; and 
(B) to the maximum extent practicable, take 
measures that are life cycle cost effective. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that Federal agencies should— 
(1) for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2030, 
reduce average building energy intensity (as 
measured in British thermal units per gross 
square foot) at facilities of the agency by 2.5 
percent each fiscal year, relative to the average 
building energy intensity of the facilities of the 
agency in fiscal year 2018; and 
(2) for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2030, 
improve water use efficiency and management, 
including stormwater management, at facilities 
of the agency by reducing agency water con-
sumption intensity— 
(A) by reducing the potable water consump-
tion by 54 percent by fiscal year 2030, relative to 
the potable water consumption of the agency in 
fiscal year 2007, through reductions of 2 percent 
each fiscal year (as measured in gallons per 
gross square foot); 
(B) by reducing the industrial, landscaping, 
and agricultural water consumption of the 
agency, as compared to a baseline of that con-
sumption by the agency in fiscal year 2010, 
through reductions of 2 percent each fiscal year 
(as measured in gallons); and

SEC. 1413. USE OF ENERGY AND WATER EFFI-
CIENCY 
MEASURES 
IN 
FEDERAL 
BUILDINGS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) Performance contracting is a private fi-
nancing tool with guaranteed energy savings 
and has been used by the Federal Government 
for nearly 30 years. 
(2) Energy savings performance contracts and 
utility energy service contacts allow the Govern-
ment to invest in infrastructure using private 
sector financing and expertise, with a guarantee 
of results. 
(3) Use of performance contracting has saved 
the Government and taxpayers more than 
$18,000,000,000. 
(4) By law, performance contracts are guaran-
teed to provide savings to Federal agencies. 
(5) On average, performance contracts achieve 
savings in excess of the contractual and statu-
tory guarantee. 
(6) In a fiscally constrained environment, per-
formance contracting helps to address the Fed-
eral Government’s backlog of maintenance and 
supplement scarce operations and maintenance 
dollars. 
(7) The House of Representatives, the Senate, 
and the Office of Management and Budget have 
all acted to recognize the value of performance 
contracts by providing distinct budgetary con-
sideration of them; in the 115th Congress, the 
House of Representatives included section 5109 
in H. Con. Res. 71 to enable the greater use of 
performance contracting and to recognize their 
full cost savings benefits. 
(8) Federal agencies are not taking full ad-
vantage of the cost-effective energy efficiency 
measures that are available and documented. 
(9) Using performance contracts to carry out 
such energy efficiency measures would benefit 
taxpayers, the economy, and the environment. 
(b) REPORTS.—Section 548(b) of the National 
Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 
8258(b)) is amended— 
(1) in paragraph (3), by striking ‘‘and’’ at the 
end; 
(2) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at

formance contracts and utility energy service 
contracts of each agency, to the extent that the 
information is not duplicative of information 
provided to the Secretary under a separate au-
thority; 
‘‘(B) the quantity and investment value of the 
contracts for the previous year; 
‘‘(C) the guaranteed energy savings, or for 
contracts without a guarantee, the estimated 
energy savings, for the previous year, as com-
pared to the measured energy savings for the 
previous year; 
‘‘(D) a forecast of the estimated quantity and 
investment value of contracts anticipated in the 
following year for each agency; and 
‘‘(E)(i) a comparison of the information de-
scribed in subparagraph (B) and the forecast de-
scribed in subparagraph (D) in the report of the 
previous year; and 
‘‘(ii) if applicable, the reasons for any dif-
ferences in the data compared under clause 
(i).’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 90 
minutes equally divided among and 
controlled by the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce and the chair 
and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Science, Space, and

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and add extraneous material on 
H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and 
Innovation Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Clean Economy Jobs and In-
novation Act. This bill is a comprehen-
sive package that will spur clean en-
ergy innovation, electrify our transpor-
tation sector, make homes and busi-
nesses more energy efficient, and mod-
ernize our electric grid. 
The Clean Economy Jobs and Innova-
tion Act presents practical and achiev-
able clean energy policies that are pos-
sible for us to achieve this year. This 
legislation lays the groundwork for im-
portant and comprehensive future cli-
mate policy. 
The main goal of this energy package 
is to move provisions we believe have a 
chance at becoming law this Congress 
after negotiations with the Senate.

MURKOWSKI
and 
MANCHIN, 
who lead the Senate Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee, have been 
working on their own energy package 
in the Senate. 
H.R. 4447 sets new energy efficiency 
standards 
for 
buildings 
and 
funds 
grants to local communities for more 
efficient schools, homes, and municipal 
buildings. This is an inexpensive way 
to save energy and reduce electricity 
bills for homeowners and businesses, 
and it has broad support. 
This legislation also supports the de-
velopment and deployment of clean, re-
newable, and distributed resources, 
like solar and wind energy, which are 
crucial to reducing our dependency on 
fossil fuels. It also supports the trans-
mission projects needed to move clean 
energy around the country. 
Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
clean energy sector was booming. Last 
year, clean energy jobs grew at twice 
the rate of overall jobs, and as of Janu-
ary, more than 3 million Americans 
were employed in these jobs. It is crit-
ical that the clean energy industry re-
cover this same momentum to secure 
America’s clean energy leadership. 
These investments will result in new, 
good-paying American jobs all across 
the country. Every million dollars in-
vested in clean energy and energy effi-
ciency produces seven to eight jobs. 
That is roughly three times as many as 
investment in fossil fuels. 
The transition to a clean energy fu-
ture also depends upon upgrading our 
transportation infrastructure to sup-
port and encourage the adoption of 
electric vehicles, or EVs. This legisla-
tion invests more than $36 billion to 
help speed up the electrification of our 
transportation sector and make EVs an 
option for more communities. It also 
authorizes funding for clean school 
buses, electric vehicle charging equip-
ment, and other zero-emission vehicle 
programs. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation also 
addresses environmental justice by es-
tablishing and reauthorizing grant pro-
grams for impacted communities to 
better 
participate 
in 
the 
environ-
mental decisions in their backyards. It 
also increases information sharing so 
communities can be better informed 
about the risks in their neighborhoods. 
And it updates the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 to increase opportunities for legal 
relief. This is a critical start to ad-
dressing the disproportionate burden 
faced by environmental justice commu-
nities around the Nation. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, this legis-
lation includes a critical bipartisan 
provision that phases out the use of 
hydrofluorocarbons, a super pollutant. 
It has strong support on both sides of 
the aisle, including environmental and 
public health groups, the entire heat-
ing and cooling industry, the Chamber 
of Commerce, and the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers. It is one of 
the most important steps we can take 
now to create manufacturing jobs and 
boost our competitiveness while pro-
tecting our environment. 
I close by thanking the Energy Sub-
committee Chairman RUSH for his lead-
ership in moving many of the bills in-
cluded in this package through the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, many 
with strong bipartisan support. I also 
thank 
Chairwoman 
EDDIE
BERNICE 
JOHNSON and Chairman GRIJALVA for 
their critical contributions to this 
package and also Representative TOM 
O’HALLERAN for being the bill’s lead 
sponsor. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion that will modernize our energy 
system, create jobs, and take positive 
steps toward addressing the climate 
crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

As a result of our consultation, I agree to 
work cooperatively on H.R. 4447 and in order 
to expedite consideration of the bill the 
Science Committee will waive formal consid-
eration of this legislation. However, this is 
not a waiver of any future jurisdictional 
claims by the Science Committee over the

OF
REPRESENTA-
TIVES, 
Washington, DC, September 15, 2020. 
Hon. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN JOHNSON: Thank you for 
consulting with the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and agreeing to discharge 
H.R. 4447, the Expanding Access to Sustain-
able Energy Act of 2019, from further consid-
eration, so that the bill may proceed expedi-
tiously to the House floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will ensure our letters on H.R. 4447 are 
entered into the Congressional Record dur-
ing floor consideration of the bill. I appre-
ciate your cooperation regarding this legis-
lation and look forward to continuing to 
work 
together 
as 
this 
measure 
moves 
through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself 11⁄2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues 
to express my disappointment in how 
this bill came together, without reg-
ular order and ignoring input from 
really any Republicans. This is not the 
way to get things done in divided gov-
ernment or signed into law, and the 
statement that the White House sub-
mitted opposing the bill makes that 
very clear. 
I am disappointed because we had the 
opportunity to do things the right way 
in the committee through bipartisan-
ship. But unfortunately, the majority 
set aside our tradition of bipartisan-
ship in favor of a messaging bill and 
election year politics. Instead of work-
ing through the rough issues and re-
porting a bill that we could all be 
proud of, the majority took the easy 
road and cobbled together a wish list 
bill. They drafted it behind closed 
doors, didn’t release it for members to 
see until the very last minute, and so 
just now, in fact, they had to introduce 
a new manager’s amendment in the 
final hour to make the corrections and 
add the new language. 
We Republicans offered a lot of 
amendments to try and improve the 
bill, but the Rules Committee did not 
allow such things to happen. Our 
amendments to invest in technological 
innovation and clean energy will not 
even get a debate. My amendment, to 
reauthorize the Nation’s pipeline safe-
ty program and strengthen our work-
force of pipeline safety inspectors, was 
also rejected. How can we be opposed to 
pipeline safety? 
I have a number of concerns about 
the underlying bill, and many of the 
Democratic amendments which I think 
are likely to pass, but I share the con-
cern that H.R. 4447 will lead to higher 
energy costs and discourage innova-
tion. This bill is going to lead to fewer 
choices for consumers when it comes to 
home heating, appliances, and energy 
providers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself another 10 seconds. 
Madam Speaker, I am also alarmed 
by the provisions that will encourage 
frivolous lawsuits, lead to permitting 
delays and even more Federal man-
dates and regulations. 
So as we rebuild after the COVID 
pandemic, we should stay focused on 
reducing barriers to growth rather 
than creating more hurdles as this bill 
does. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TONKO), who is the 
chairman of the Environment and Cli-
mate Change Subcommittee. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I thank 
the gentleman from New Jersey for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I begin by thanking 
Chairs PALLONE, JOHNSON, and GRI-
JALVA for all of their hard work on this 
package. 
I have no delusions that this bill will 
solve climate change, but it can play a 
meaningful role in deploying clean en-
ergy and energy efficiency while sup-
porting improvements and cost reduc-
tions in technologies that we are going 
to need to achieve our decarbonization 
goals. 
This package does not have every-
thing in it that I would have wanted. 
However, my threshold for support is 
not whether it is perfect. The questions 
are: Would it be a net positive? Would 
it hasten our transition to clean en-
ergy? Would it play a role, even a mod-
est one, in reducing climate and tradi-
tional pollution? And would it create 
new American jobs? 
I think the answer to each of these 
questions is an obvious yes. 
This package is going to allow us to 
weatherize more low-income Ameri-
cans’ homes, build more EV charging 
infrastructure, and codify important 
environmental justice requirements, 
which have been ignored for the past 4 
years. 
It includes bills I have authored to 
support the Department of Energy’s Of-
fice of Wind, to streamline the permit-
ting process for distributed energy re-
sources, and to ensure that the re-
search dollars we authorize are pro-
tected by strong, scientific integrity 
policies. 
It also includes the American Innova-
tion and Manufacturing Leadership 
Act, bipartisan legislation that directs 
EPA 
to 
phase 
down 
hydrofluorocarbons, 
highly 
potent 
greenhouse gasses, by some 85 percent 
over 15 years. 
It will position the United States to 
lead the world in the transition to 
next-generation 
refrigerants, 
create 
33,000 manufacturing jobs, and ensure 
we do our part to avoid up to one-half 
degree Celsius in global warming be-
fore the end of this century. 
While I am encouraged that the Sen-
ate has reached agreement on HFCs, we 
are still reviewing the details. But I 
want to make certain that this provi-
sion is in those future negotiations. I 
look forward to continuing the discus-
sions with our Senate counterparts and 
getting the goals of this language en-
acted. 
This bill isn’t perfect, but with all 
the political uncertainty, this is a 
package we can take to the Senate and 
fight for important clean energy wins 
to be enacted this year. The clean en-
ergy transition cannot wait, and nei-
ther should we. 
I am eager to work with any Member 
of this Chamber on future legislation 
that is bold, ambitious, and rises to the 
scale of the climate crisis. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SHIMKUS), the top Republican 
on the Environment Subcommittee. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. It is 
great to be with my friends on the 
floor. 
I saw an E&E story earlier this week 
titled ‘‘House divided over impact, wis-
dom of clean energy bill.’’ Where but in 
D.C. can you take an 8-page bill and 
turn it into a 900-page bill? Not only 
that, it authorizes $135 billion with no 
offsets, and it divides your own Cau-
cus? You can’t outspend some Demo-
crats. 
When I testified against this bill at 
the Rules Committee on Monday, my 
friend Chairman PALLONE kept making 
the point that all he wanted to do was 
get to a conference with the Senate. 
Congressman TOM COLE asked if the 
House position wouldn’t be stronger 
with a bipartisan bill? I think the an-
swer is yes, it would, but that is not 
what we have here today. 
Let me debunk this myth of biparti-
sanship. There are 38 bills from the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee in this 
package, 38. Committee Republicans 
are neutral on four of them, and we 
support 11 and either oppose or have se-
rious concerns with the remaining 23. 
Of those 38 bills, we had no regular 
order on 15 of them. The chairman used 
to beat us about the head and shoulders 
about regular order. And I know this is 
an irregular time, but 15 of these bills 
had no regular order, no hearing, no 
subcommittee mark, and no full com-
mittee mark. Only two had legislative 
hearings.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4867 
September 23, 2020 
Even worse, at least three of the bills 
included were bipartisan deals that 
passed the committee or the House, 
and then Democrats went back on 
those deals and changed the language. 
Now we find out that an environmental 
stressors title was added in the man-
ager’s amendment that received no de-
liberation in the committee. 
But let me outline a few problems 
other than size, cost, and process, if 
that is not enough. 
Instead of removing barriers to pipe-
lines and transmission lines, this bill 
inserts new review criteria to infra-
structure permitting decisions. These 
provisions don’t just target fossil fuels; 
they delay deployment of the green en-
ergy Democrats say they want 
The RPM Act included in this bill al-
lows the EPA to establish a new Fed-
eral registry to monitor sales, track 
parts, and aid enforcement against not 
just race cars, but every car and truck 
on the road. 
The included HFC provisions totally 
and disingenuously flaunt the Inter-
state Commerce Clause by failing to 
preempt State laws. The included ac-
celerator provisions invite activists to 
further change the HFC standards 
through the EPA. The 5-year essential 
use exemption for products like asthma 
inhalers, fire suppression systems, and 
self-defense sprays is laughable when 
you find out that this exemption does 
not even become available until 2034, 
after HFCs have become less available 
and more expensive. 
The Blue Collar to Green Collar en-
ergy workforce grant program included 
in this bill excludes eligibility for not 
just fossil fuels but nuclear energy. So 
not only would a rush to green put peo-
ple out of work, this grant program 
would fail to provide equal opportuni-
ties for the biggest zero-emission en-
ergy sector. 
Let the buyer beware. This rush to 
green is exactly what the State of Cali-
fornia has done to their electricity 
grid. 
b 1645 
What do you see? We see rolling 
blackouts and we see higher costs. 
In this environmental justice world, 
it is a government-mandated injustice 
to poor communities, poor commu-
nities that already spend a higher per-
centage of their income on energy 
costs and will face even higher costs 
and with less reliability and, with that, 
less opportunity with the direction 
that this package takes us. 
This is very, very unfortunate. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. ESHOO), the chair 
of our Health Subcommittee. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee for his leadership 
and for what is being brought to the 
floor today. 
I am very pleased to be here in sup-
port of the Clean Economy Jobs and In-
novation Act. I think this is exactly 
what our country needs. It is looking 
into the future and saying this is the 
way we are going to shape it, that 
America will become a leader inno-
vatively relative to clean air and clean 
jobs, good-paying jobs. 
So this is something that is needed 
for our country: to promote clean en-
ergy and energy efficiency; to protect 
our planet, which is really facing an 
existential threat from the warming of 
the climate. 
I remember many years ago, Madam 
Speaker, as there was a debate going 
on at the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, I listened to both sides. They 
were going back and forth. There were 
clear differences. 
So, when it was my turn to speak, I 
said, ‘‘Remember this: I will see you on 
the floor,’’ meaning that something 
was going to happen in someone’s dis-
trict 
where 
there 
was 
accelerated 
flooding, accelerated fires, more power-
ful hurricanes and tornadoes, and then 
we have to come to the floor to clean 
up and try to repair and rehabilitate 
communities. So this is about our col-
lective future. 
Those who question the existence of 
climate change need only look to Cali-
fornia, where 10 of the 20 largest 
wildfires on record occurred in the last 
decade, including 5 this year alone. 
Our planet is sounding the alarm, 
and Congress needs to lead, respond to 
this, take it seriously, and be willing 
to change. Now, without action, we 
know what is going to happen. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from California. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman yielding me the 
additional time. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased that 
today’s package includes my legisla-
tion, the Smoke Planning and Re-
search Act. 
I talked about the fires, but what ev-
eryone needs to understand is what is 
so deadly about the wildfire smoke. 
The poisonous particulates are very 
dangerous for children because their 
lungs are still developing, very dan-
gerous for seniors, very dangerous for 
anyone to breathe, because it is a form 
of poison. 
We know that the smoke travels not 
only hundreds of miles, but thousands 
of miles. 
So this legislation funds the EPA and 
leading universities to study the public 
health effects of wildfire smoke, and I 
am so pleased that it is in the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
chairman for including it. I also want 
to thank Speaker PELOSI, who saw the 
merits of addressing this particular 
issue, and that it is, today, part of this 
critically needed clean energy package. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. LATTA). 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, my good friend from 
Michigan, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 4447, which represents a missed 
opportunity to advance true bipartisan 
policies that would secure our Nation’s 
energy future. 
America’s innovators have shown 
over the past 15 years that they are ca-
pable of spurring economic growth and 
reducing emissions as long as the 
United States has a regulatory envi-
ronment that is conducive to the devel-
opment and deployment of new tech-
nologies. 
In fact, according to an April EPA re-
port, national greenhouse gas emis-
sions have fallen by 10 percent since 
2005 and power sector emissions have 
fallen by 27 percent while, during the 
same period, our economy grew by 25 
percent. Unfortunately, H.R. 4447 would 
do nothing to cultivate the necessary 
regulatory environment to continue to 
build on these accomplishments. 
Another 
reason 
to 
be 
concerned 
about this bill is the price tag. At a 
time when our country is seeing record 
budget deficits, how has the majority 
chosen to respond? By spending over 
$135 billion in taxpayer funds on par-
tisan energy mandates that pick win-
ners and losers. 
Finally, my Republican colleagues 
and I offered amendments to improve 
this bill. My amendment would have 
authorized the establishment and oper-
ation of a uranium reserve to assure its 
availability in the event of a market 
disruption and to support strategic fuel 
cycle capabilities in the United States. 
This policy would result in lower car-
bon emissions, new jobs, and a more se-
cure world. 
Unfortunately, the majority ruled 
against this amendment, as well as 
those offered by my Republican col-
leagues on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee that would have ensured 
the American people would have access 
to affordable and reliable sources of en-
ergy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this partisan legisla-
tion. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), our majority 
leader, who has prioritized this bill and 
shepherded it to the floor. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chair of the committee for 
his focus and hard work on behalf of 
our environment and on behalf of re-
versing climate change and on behalf 
of the health and welfare of the Amer-
ican people. 
The global climate crisis is one of the 
greatest challenges of our time. We 
must confront climate change, and an 
essential part of that is investing in 
clean energy innovation. 
This alone is certainly not going to 
be enough to address the climate crisis 
we face, but it is a critical step forward 
that we can and must take now. That 
is why House Democrats are bringing 
forward the Clean Economy Jobs and 
Innovation Act today. 
I am sorry this is not a bipartisan 
bill because, like COVID–19, climate

September 23, 2020 
change is not a partisan issue. It 
should not be a partisan issue. 
This legislation represents progress 
in the fight against the climate crisis. 
It represents a significant investment 
in clean energy infrastructure and job 
creation. 
In addition to investing in clean en-
ergy production, distribution, and stor-
age, this legislation sets new energy ef-
ficiency standards—I believe my Re-
publican colleagues are for that; I hope 
they are for that—for buildings and 
provides funding for homes, schools, 
manufacturing facilities, and public 
buildings to upgrade and improve en-
ergy efficiency. That is in everybody’s 
best interests. 
This bill makes bold investments in 
wind and solar and advanced nuclear 
technologies, of which I am a very 
strong supporter, and in helping to 
decarbonize the fossil fuel sector. 
If we hope to meet the targets that 
climate scientists say are necessary to 
avoid 
the 
most 
catastrophic 
con-
sequences of climate change, many of 
which we are seeing as we speak today 
on the floor of this House, we are going 
to need to employ all of these tech-
nologies. 
Recognizing the need to fight for en-
vironmental justice, the Clean Econ-
omy 
Jobs 
and 
Innovation 
Act 
prioritizes the needs of those living on 
the front lines of the climate crisis, in-
cluding minority, Tribal, and low-in-
come communities. They can’t protect 
themselves. They don’t have the dol-
lars to do so. It is up to us to make 
sure that they are protected. 
We are also creating a clean energy 
workforce 
development 
program, 
championed by my dear friend BOBBY 
RUSH, to train workers to succeed and 
help America lead the clean energy 
revolution. 
While 
the 
Trump 
administration 
cedes the race to being a world leader, 
withdrawing from all the other nations 
of the world that have a consensus that 
we need to deal with climate change 
and we need to deal with it together, 
we withdraw from that agreement. 
We need to make sure that we con-
tinue to be a world leader in the clean 
energy economy to our foreign com-
petitors. This bill seizes the moment 
and takes advantage of the economic 
opportunities that come from taking a 
bold approach to the global climate 
crisis. House Democrats recognize that 
you can’t lead the clean energy econ-
omy if you refuse to believe that clean-
er energy is necessary. 
Until we get serious about the dan-
gers of the climate crisis, America will 
be unable to take advantage of its eco-
nomic opportunities. That is why, 
Madam Speaker, this bill is so very im-
portant and why I am urging all of my 
colleagues to join in supporting it. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
FRANK
PALLONE
of the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee; 
Chairwoman 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of the Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee; and 
Chairman RAU´ L GRIJALVA of the Nat-
ural Resources Committee for working 
so hard to bring this legislation to-
gether and advance it to the floor. 
Many of these bills that are incor-
porated here, I think, have Republican 
support, and this bill ought to have Re-
publican support. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all the 
Democratic members of those commit-
tees and Republicans who tried to work 
constructively and the bill sponsors for 
their hard work and contributions to 
this legislation. 
Today, the Democratic-led House, 
Madam Speaker, is doing its job for the 
people by supporting the development 
of a clean energy economy and taking 
important steps to tackle the climate 
crisis in a serious way that creates jobs 
and opportunities for our workers. 
During the civil rights era, there was 
a movie, ‘‘Mississippi Burning.’’ It had 
an effect of us addressing systemic rac-
ism in America. 
Now, much of America, millions of 
acres, are burning at historic levels. 
Storms in the Gulf are occurring at 
historic levels. Storms in the Atlantic 
along the Atlantic Coast and twisters 
in the Midwest are occurring at his-
toric levels. It is not appropriate for us 
to say, as the President said on COVID– 
19 and the deaths that occurred, ‘‘It is 
what it is.’’ 
We are here, Madam Speaker, be-
cause, when we see that what it is is 
not right, we ought to act, and that is 
what we are doing. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will vote ‘‘yes’’ for a cleaner 
environment, a safer environment, a 
healthier environment, and a more 
prosperous and successful America. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from West 
Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY). 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman UPTON for yielding. 
Well, Madam Speaker, here we go 
again: another partisan bill that lead-
ership contends will save the environ-
ment. But last week, experts testified 
that it will not prevent wildfires on the 
West Coast, droughts in the Midwest, 
or hurricanes on the East Coast. This is 
just another effort to gin up the liberal 
base and divide the House before the 
election. 
But what the bill does do is it creates 
uncertainty, increases consumer costs, 
and jeopardizes national security. 
Madam Speaker, I thought we were 
here to find solutions for the environ-
ment, but apparently not. 
The majority is deliberately mis-
leading the American public with this 
legislation. Have they no shame? Re-
member, this bill will not prevent 
wildfires, droughts, or hurricanes. 
Madam Speaker, Congress can do bet-
ter. America deserves better.

Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR), who chairs 
the Select Committee on Climate Cri-
sis and is also a member of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman PALLONE 
for yielding me the time. 
We are in the grips of a climate cri-
sis, a climate emergency, and time is 
running out. Time is running out to 
avoid the worst consequences of a heat-
ing planet. Time is running out to 
avoid the escalating costs that are 
weighing down families and businesses 
across America. 
So this Clean Economy Jobs and In-
novation Act is an important step. It 
brings us a little bit closer to the 
major ambitious steps that we must 
take towards a 100 percent clean en-
ergy economy. 
Here are a few things that are impor-
tant about this package. It follows the 
science. The scientists and experts tell 
us that we truly are running out of 
time to reduce carbon emissions and 
greenhouse gases. We must do it as 
soon as possible, but no later than 2050. 
That means we have to get going right 
away. 
This package also puts money back 
in the pockets of consumers and busi-
nesses and it will create thousands of 
jobs. These are the jobs that the 
younger generation are hungry for, in 
manufacturing and science, and build-
ing resilience among communities all 
across this country. 
This bill also empowers environ-
mental justice communities to address 
pollution and to protect their health. 
Very importantly, on a bipartisan 
basis, bicameral basis, we have to ad-
dress 
hydrofluorocarbons. 
A 
hydrofluorocarbon is a very damaging 
greenhouse gas, much more damaging 
than carbon dioxide. 
We have an opportunity in this Con-
gress 
to 
address 
those 
hydrofluorocarbons and bring them 
under control. If we don’t do this now, 
it is going to be much more difficult to 
do it in the future. 
So 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
PALLONE, 
Chairwoman JOHNSON, and I thank my 
colleagues for doing what they can. 
Next up are the ambitious policies to 
truly solve the climate crisis. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 4447, despite holding out 
hope that we would have a truly bipar-
tisan energy package moving through 
this body. 
As I look at the bill, we can’t ignore 
the tremendous price tag, $135 billion, 
without discussing the use of valuable 
taxpayer dollars. This bill’s price tag 
reflects the many subsidy programs 
that duplicate existing programs with-
out meaningful attention applied to ad-
dressing the regulatory burdens facing 
these industries. 
If the goal is to transition to a clean-
er energy economy, we won’t see real 
progress without a serious discussion 
about reforming existing regulatory 
barriers.

September 23, 2020 
An example is the cumbersome NEPA 
review process which has slowed infra-
structure projects for years and added 
countless sums in costs to projects, 
without any added benefit to the peo-
ple. 
Another concern I have with this bill 
is the focus on larger cities while leav-
ing rural communities, like the ones I 
represent in south Georgia, on the way-
side. If the goal is to spur on economic 
investments in the energy sector, the 
rural parts of America must be in-
cluded. 
There are also other concerns, such 
as expensive electric vehicle mandates 
and experimental technologies that 
will leave the taxpayer footing the bill. 
This package, unfortunately, is not 
reflective of extensive bipartisan work 
in committee to pass policies that 
would help us move forward. Instead, it 
is a wish list of expensive and duplicate 
programs that will bog down the sig-
nificant progress that has already been 
made here. 
There are some programs and ideas 
that deserve separate consideration be-
cause of bipartisan support, but unfor-
tunately, this package falls short. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may 
I ask how much time remains on each 
side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 11 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Michigan has 111⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ), a member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, environ-
mental injustices disproportionately 
impact underserved communities and 
communities of color around the coun-
try. 
We have experienced this firsthand in 
the Eastern Coachella Valley in my 
district—environmental hazards that 
worsen quality of life and harm the 
public’s health; children struggling to 
breathe on their way to school; resi-
dents with undrinkable water from 
high levels of arsenic. 
Let me be clear. Having clean water 
to drink and clean air to breathe is not 
a privilege just for the affluent few. It 
is a right and a common good for ev-
eryone. That is why I am glad my bill, 
H.R. 3923, the Environmental Justice 
Act of 2019, is passing the House this 
week as part of the Clean Economy 
Jobs and Innovation Act. 
My bill will strengthen protections 
for vulnerable populations, give im-
pacted communities the ability to hold 
big corporations and government ac-
countable, and provide needed funds to 
mitigate and prevent future instances 
of environmental injustice. 
I would like to thank Chairman PAL-
LONE
and 
Subcommittee 
Chairman 
TONKO for working with me on this im-
portant legislation. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN). 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the former chairman for 
yielding me the time today. 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 4447, the 
Democrat’s so-called energy package. 
This bill promotes a radical Green New 
Deal policy that would cost Americans 
more than $135 billion. Meanwhile, the 
bill provides no regulatory or perma-
nent reforms. 
If Democrats were serious about re-
ducing emissions, they would focus on 
getting clean technologies, like nu-
clear energy, to market quicker. 
I offered an amendment last night, 
but it was rejected by the Rules Com-
mittee which would facilitate efficient 
environmental reviews for nuclear re-
actor licensing. Its goal was to accel-
erate the deployment of nuclear reac-
tors which generate zero emissions dur-
ing electricity generation, if that is 
your goal, zero emissions. Unfortu-
nately, 
Democrats 
would 
rather 
weaponize our permitting laws for po-
litical motives. 
If we eliminate natural gas, or nu-
clear, in power generation and transi-
tion to 100 percent renewables, which 
H.R. 4447 seeks to do, the cost to na-
tional security would be detrimental. 
The United States would shift from 
being an energy-dominant country to 
being energy dependent at a cost to en-
ergy consumers because lower income 
Americans in this deal would pay more 
as a percentage of their disposable in-
come than others. 
It would be costly to the environ-
ment and our own security self-inter-
est. I don’t understand why my amend-
ments aren’t made part of this package 
other than the politics. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
H.R. 4447. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCNERNEY), also a 
member of our committee. 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Climate change is accelerating and 
poses a growing threat to our economy 
and to our world. We must address cli-
mate change with the urgency that it 
demands, and that means we must all 
take action. 
That is why I am proud to have intro-
duced two bipartisan pieces of legisla-
tion included in this package: the 
Smart Energy and Water Efficiency 
Act, which I authored with Representa-
tive KINZINGER, which aims to create 
an innovative water and energy re-
source management pilot program with 
the Department of Energy. 
The Advanced Nuclear Fuel Avail-
ability Act, which I co-led with Rep-
resentative FLORES, informed the lan-
guage in this package ensuring that 
adequate supplies of domestically pro-
duced high-assay low-enriched uranium 
are available in the United States, 
something that is essential for some of 
the advanced nuclear reactor designs 
that are currently being developed. 
The Clean Economy Jobs and Innova-
tion Act represents the type of strong, 
concrete steps that we must take to 
prevent the catastrophic impacts of 
climate change. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, may I 
ask how much time each side has re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Michigan has 91⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from New 
Jersey has 9 minutes remaining. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Michigan and former 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee for yielding me the time. 
I am disappointed that during Na-
tional Clean Energy Week we are con-
sidering a bill that fails to prioritize 
affordable and reliable energy for all 
Americans and only furthers the rad-
ical left’s socialist Green New Deal pri-
orities. 
H.R. 4447 spent more than $135 billion 
of hardworking Americans’ tax dollars 
while ignoring meaningful reforms of 
our rural communities. Specifically, 
they want to establish a $20 billion 
Federal green bank to subsidize pre-
ferred green projects at the expense of 
others, like nuclear energy. The bill 
would also exclude nuclear energy from 
their proposed Blue Collar to Green 
Collar energy workforce grant pro-
gram. This is unacceptable. 
Nuclear energy fuels our Nation 
while helping to provide America with 
environmental, economic, and national 
security. I am proud that Georgia’s 
12th Congressional District is home to 
two nuclear power plants: Plant Vogtle 
and Plant Hatch, almost 80 percent of 
Georgia Power’s nuclear capacity. 
This industry directly supports well- 
paying jobs, powers our national de-
fense, and currently generates nearly 
20 percent of our country’s electricity 
without any carbon emissions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, if my 
colleagues want to have a real policy 
discussion about clean energy and 
focus on solutions, they should oppose 
this partisan power grab and support 
nuclear energy. 
Georgia has some of the most com-
petitive electricity rates in the coun-
try thanks to our energy policy. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chair and the committees of 
jurisdiction for this bill. 
For too long, communities of color, 
indigenous communities, and economi-
cally 
oppressed 
communities 
have 
borne a disproportionate burden from 
toxic pollution and environmental deg-
radation. 
Communities experiencing environ-
mental injustice have been subjected

to systemic racial, social, and eco-
nomic injustice. 
This legislation will push all of our 
communities forward together, wheth-
er through the $20 billion clean energy 
and sustainability accelerator to fi-
nance and mobilize private investment 
in 
low-carbon 
technologies 
and 
projects; over $4 billion for research, 
development, demonstration, and com-
mercial application to advance cut-
ting-edge 
renewable 
energy 
tech-
nologies, including: solar, wind, geo-
thermal, and water power; or grants to 
local communities to improve energy 
efficiency, including workforce train-
ing and rebates for weatherization. 
It also authorizes over $36 billion for 
transportation electrification, which 
will help Nevada, including $650 million 
to 
deploy 
low- 
and 
zero-emissions 
school buses. 
I urge my colleagues to approve this 
measure. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I have 
two remaining speakers, so I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1715 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. STANTON). 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Clean 
Economy Jobs and Innovation Act. 
To better position ourselves for the 
21st century economy, we need to in-
vest in energy-efficient infrastructure 
that is both sustainable and makes 
good business sense. This bill does that 
by incorporating my legislation to re-
authorize the Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Block Grant program to 
provide grants to States, local govern-
ments, and our Native American Tribes 
to reduce fossil fuel emissions and con-
serve energy. 
When this program was last funded, 
local governments were able to pursue 
a large range of projects, from energy 
retrofits to deployment of LED street 
lighting and solar energy systems to 
electric vehicle charging stations and 
alternative fuel pumps. 
A national evaluation of the pro-
gram’s effectiveness found that with 
just 1 year of funding, 25.7 million met-
ric tons of carbon equivalent was 
avoided. And $5.2 billion in cumulative 
energy bill savings were produced, 70 
percent of which were realized by resi-
dential customers. 
Just imagine what we can achieve 
with the dedicated, multiyear funding 
this bill provides. It will create jobs, 
help consumers save on their energy 
bills, open new opportunities for local 
governments to invest in energy con-
servation, and reduce carbon pollution. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
PALLONE for his leadership on this leg-
islation. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN), 
who is the top Republican on the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my friend, the ranking 
member of the House Energy Sub-
committee and the former chairman of 
the full committee, Mr. UPTON, for 
yielding me this time. 
Tragically, I have to rise in opposi-
tion to H.R. 4447. 
This reminds me of the last time 
Democrats were in charge. This is now 
an 894-page bill. Some of it has been 
through committee. It has never been 
looked at in its entirety, and it has 
only been available for a few days with-
in the rules, but certainly not long 
enough for the American people to 
fully digest and know everything about 
it. It is unfortunate because I think we 
could do a lot more to come together 
and agree on a package that would 
cause our economy to really rebound 
and to drive clean innovation the 
American way. 
You see, Madam Speaker, the key to 
expanding clean energy and creating 
prosperous jobs in America is to actu-
ally reduce the barriers to building in-
frastructure, not increase them, and to 
deploy innovative new technologies 
that will ensure reliable, affordable en-
ergy 
for 
the 
economy. 
This 
will 
produce the economic rebound and the 
growth that we all want, growth that 
maintains 
environmental 
standards 
but creates economic opportunities, es-
pecially for the poor and the disadvan-
taged. It generates the resources for 
communities and families to prepare 
for their futures. 
In recent years, Madam Speaker, Re-
publicans have led successful efforts to 
enact laws that enable more rapid li-
censing of hydropower facilities, zero 
carbon emission hydropower. We are 
talking 
small 
scale 
in 
irrigation 
ditches that are now piped. We are cre-
ating new electricity with no emis-
sions. We are putting water into 
streams for fish. And we are pressur-
izing systems for farmers. 
We did more of that under a Republic 
majority, and there is more we can do 
now, but we are not. 
We want more seamless delivery and 
export of clean-burning natural gas. If 
you think of the conversion that has 
occurred from coal to gas, the reduc-
tion of emissions, we lead the world in 
reducing emissions. We have created 
enormous wealth and jobs in areas that 
had terrible poverty and needed eco-
nomic development. We have increased 
private-sector use of carbon capture 
technologies. 
I think there is great hope in the fu-
ture with our brilliant scientists to do 
even more in this space and to stream-
line licensing to enable advanced nu-
clear energy production. America has 
always led in that category, and there 
are new opportunities out there to do 
small-scale nuclear energy. 
We need to do more of that, but 
sadly, this bill doesn’t get us where we 
need to go. These are all good things 
for the economy and, frankly, good 
things for the planet. 
Madam Speaker, you won’t hear it 
from the radical left, but the United 
States has actually been leading the 
world in carbon reductions. It shows 
the largest absolute decline in emis-
sions of all countries since the year 
2000. Frankly, we have reduced carbon 
emissions more in total than Britain, 
France, Germany, and Canada com-
bined—combined, Madam Speaker. So 
the United States continues to improve 
its air quality for all communities. 
Particulate matter pollution is down 25 
percent to 44 percent in urban areas 
around the Nation since 2007. This is 
tremendous news for disadvantaged 
communities 
and, 
frankly, 
for 
all 
Americans. 
All this happened while the United 
States has reemerged as an energy su-
perpower on top of the economic boom 
of the shale revolution. So our job 
today should be to build upon that. 
Unfortunately, Democrats’ legisla-
tion goes in the other direction, I be-
lieve. It destroys some of these gains, 
and it is not the way we should do this. 
In this Congress, my Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce Republican col-
leagues have introduced a number of 
bills to encourage investment in infra-
structure, remove more regulatory bar-
riers to permitting and licensing to en-
sure affordable, reliable energy and to 
expand access to clean energy, promote 
nuclear innovation, and protect nat-
ural gas resources. 
Yes, we have a very aggressive, posi-
tive, and pro-environment energy agen-
da as Republicans. None of the amend-
ments based upon these reforms, unfor-
tunately, made it into H.R. 4447. No. 
Democrats kept those out, and that is 
a problem. 
Madam Speaker, you do not achieve 
a prosperous economy and advance 
clean energy innovations without re-
moving the barriers to building and de-
ploying new technology. You certainly 
don’t achieve this by focusing instead 
on enacting more than 135 billion bor-
rowed dollars in Federal spending, 
scores of new Federal subsidy pro-
grams, new regulations that delay 
siting and building, and raising elec-
tricity rates. This bill does that, and it 
increases the cost of new homes and in-
frastructure. 
Yet, that is what this 900-page gorilla 
does in the room. Sure, there are some 
bipartisan provisions, but that does not 
make this a workable bill for the 
American public. Taken together, pro-
visions in this bill will undermine any 
efforts to expand infrastructure or 
build the innovations. 
The bill ignores the priorities of 
rural Americans whose reliance on af-
fordable energy is critical to their pro-
ductivity and livelihoods. Instead, this 
bill gives billions for city-oriented 
green energy and efficiency programs, 
leaving the rural areas behind with 
nearly $50 billion in spending and man-
dates to drive a transformation toward 
electric vehicles that are sure to drive 
up electricity rates and transportation 
costs. 
Most troubling are new provisions 
concerning NEPA and other reviews 
seeded throughout this bill. These are

sure to lead to delay, litigation, and 
loss of opportunity. It will take longer 
to get a permit, longer to site a 
project, and longer to get a license, as 
if it didn’t take long enough now. 
The bill introduces, without any 
committee review, new private causes 
of action that are sure to benefit trial 
lawyers but at the expense of ordinary 
Americans who want more jobs and 
better opportunity. 
All of this will, unfortunately, keep 
investments sidelined and any projects 
funded in the bill on the lab table. This 
is not energy policy. This is Big Gov-
ernment prescription, and we should 
not support this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
you know the ordinary people that this 
legislation helps in my district are 
young African-American men unem-
ployed, 
young 
African-American 
women unemployed, LatinX men and 
women, young African-American men, 
young LatinX men and women, and as 
well high school graduates and beyond. 
That is the ordinary Americans in H.R. 
4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and In-
novation Act. 
So I thank Mr. PALLONE
and Ms. 
JOHNSON for their leadership. 
Let me tell you, Madam Speaker, the 
journey that I have taken. I have been 
an energy lawyer. I have worked in the 
arena where we have had fossil fuel. 
But do you know what, Madam Speak-
er? The Greater Houston Partnership, 
our chamber, has just designated a 
clean energy director to work on low 
carbon in our community. 
The transition to a low-carbon soci-
ety by investing in clean energy this 
bill provides, distributing energy re-
sources, an energy storage system, and 
a microgrid, all of which builds resil-
iency and are crucial to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
I introduced legislation dealing with 
wetlands to be able to ensure that the 
wetlands would be recaptured when 
they are being utilized for energy pro-
duction, and we use that for the envi-
ronment and for jobs. 
But here we have a response to the 
issue of low carbon. My district was 
devastated by Hurricane Harvey. That 
is climate change. So it is important to 
recognize that climate change dis-
proportionately 
impacts 
low-income 
communities 
of 
color. 
H.R. 
4447 
prioritizes clean energy projects lo-
cated 
in 
low-income, 
marginalized 
communities. 
My 
constituents 
are 
waiting in line for these jobs. It ad-
vances the development of technologies 
and practices that expand access to 
clean energy. 
I represent a community where con-
tamination by creosote came, and 
Superfund, trying to clean that up. In 
the meantime, people are suffering 
from cancer clusters. So when we talk 
about cleaning the environment and 
creating jobs, we are long overdue for 
the Clean Economy Jobs and Innova-
tion Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I want to answer the gentleman’s ques-
tion about ordinary Americans. These 
are 
ordinary 
Americans, 
some 
of 
whom, because of the climate change 
or the inequity in environmental injus-
tice, have faced the wrong side of en-
ergy. I want them to face the good side. 
So not only does the bill establish a 
clean energy workforce development 
program to educate and train the next 
generation of clean energy researchers, 
scientists, and professionals, but it also 
protects domestic manufacturing by 
requiring 
that 
any 
project 
funded 
under the act to construct, alter, main-
tain, or repair a public building or pub-
lic work only use iron, steel, and man-
ufactured goods produced in the United 
States. 
Madam Speaker, this is a new start, 
but it brings old friends to the table. It 
brings Houston with the Greater Hous-
ton Partnership with a clean energy di-
rector who wants to move toward low 
carbon. It brings energy companies 
that I questioned during the BP spill 
that indicated to me they have a huge 
environmental section in their corpora-
tions. We can all work together. 
I am a strong supporter of the Clean 
Economy Jobs and Innovation Act be-
cause it is going to bring jobs and re- 
envision America. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
House Judiciary and Homeland Committees, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 4447, the ‘‘Clean 
Economy Jobs and Innovation Act,’’ which 
makes long-overdue reforms to U.S. energy 
policy and authorizes major investments in the 
transition to a low-carbon future. 
This robust legislation promises to usher in 
a new era in American innovation, serving as 
a down-payment on comprehensive climate 
action. 
It includes: 
Programs to develop and deploy renewable 
and distributed energy resources; improve the 
efficiency of our homes and businesses; elec-
trify our transportation sector; modernize the 
grid and enhance its resiliency; prioritize the 
needs of environmental justice communities; 
and reduce carbon pollution from industrial 
and traditional sources. 
Taken together, these measures provide a 
path towards modernizing our energy system 
while also taking an important forward in ad-
dressing the current the climate crisis in addi-
tion to growing our economy. 
Specifically, this bill supports the transition 
to a low-carbon economy by investing in clean 
energy, distributed energy resources, energy 
storage systems, and microgrid, all of which 
build resiliency and are crucial to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Furthermore, H.R. 4447 sets new energy ef-
ficiency standards for buildings, which roughly 
count towards 30 percent of greenhouse gas 
pollution, and provides funding for schools, 
homes, municipal buildings, and manufac-
turing facilities to improve efficiency and de-
ploy energy-efficient technologies. 
Reducing our carbon output is crucial in the 
fight against this current climate crisis, and we 
are in a crisis. 
With wildfires raging on the west coast and 
multiple ‘‘500-year’’ floods on the Gulf Coast 
every few years, there is no room for denials 
or protestations against the existence of cli-
mate change. 
In 2017, Hurricane Harvey devastated my 
district. 
Rainfall from the storm was calculated to be 
between 50 and 60 inches in some areas, 
causing roughly $125 billion in damage, dis-
placing over 100,000 people, and leaving ap-
proximately 103 people dead. 
For years, climate scientists have warned 
that global warming is creating conditions that 
allow these storms to become more powerful, 
and perhaps even more frequent. 
According to the 2014 Climate Assessment, 
produced by the federal government, the 
amount of water vapor in the atmosphere has 
increased due to human-caused warming, 
causing extra moisture to be available to 
storm systems and resulting in heavier 
rainfalls. 
Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have 
been a staunch advocate for innovation and 
increased funding for research and develop-
ment, and I am proud that this bill prioritizes 
this too. 
H.R. 4447 authorizes over $4 billion for re-
search, development demonstration, and com-
mercial application to advance cutting-edge re-
newable energy technologies, including solar, 
wind, geothermal, and waterpower. 
It also drives investment in clean energy in-
novation by increasing funding for the Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, in-
cluding a path to double its funding by fiscal 
year 2025. 
Madam Speaker, it is no secret that climate 
change disproportionately impacts low-income, 
communities of color. 
H.R. 4447 prioritizes clean energy projects 
located in low-income and marginalized com-
munities and advances the development of 
technologies and practices that expand access 
to clean energy, including $25 million for 
grants 
to 
deploy 
energy 
storage 
and 
microgrids in rural communities and $1 billion 
for solar installations in low-income commu-
nities. 
In addition, the bill restores private rights of 
action against recipients of federal funding 
based on discriminatory disparate impacts. 
I have seen first-hand the reality of environ-
mental injustice in my own district. 
The Fifth Ward and the northeast neighbor-
hoods in Houston, Texas, are predominantly 
comprised of African American residents. 
They are some of the oldest and poorest 
communities in Houston. 
The median income in the area is $26,644, 
compared to $49,399 for all of Houston. 
About 35 percent of families here live in 
poverty, more than double Harris County’s 14 
percent poverty rate, according to the Census. 
It is also the location of a cancer cluster due 
to creosote contamination from the neigh-
boring railroad yard. 
For decades, a railroad company operated a 
wood treatment facility, dipping railroad ties in 
the preservative creosote, a cancer-causing 
chemical listed as a hazardous substance by 
the Environmental Protection Agency. 
The creosote emitted fumes, leached into 
the soil and ran through ditches when it rained 
or flooded. 
At my urging, the Texas Department of 
State Health Services (DSHS), conducted a

major study on the incidences of cancer clus-
ters in the Houston and found that ‘‘the num-
bers of esophagus, lung and bronchus and 
larynx cancers were statistically significantly 
greater than is expected based on cancer 
rates in Texas [writ large].’’ 
This is not a unique occurrence. 
The prevalence of cancer clusters and other 
health disparities in low-income, communities 
of color happens far too often across the na-
tion. 
This clean energy bill can help many neigh-
borhoods like these. 
The Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation 
Act also includes provisions to improve work-
force development and provide labor protec-
tions. 
Not only does the bill establish a clean en-
ergy workforce development program to edu-
cate and train the next generation of clean en-
ergy 
researchers, 
scientists, 
and 
profes-
sionals, but it also protects domestic manufac-
turing by requiring that any project funded 
under the Act to construct, alter, maintain, or 
repair a public building or public work only use 
iron, steel, and manufactured goods produced 
in the United States. 
As we seek to rebuild our economy from the 
devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, we 
must look to invest in sectors of the economy 
that are ripe for growth. 
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, clean en-
ergy was one of the biggest and fastest-grow-
ing employers across the country. 
In 2019, clean energy’s share of the entire 
energy workforce was 40 percent. 
In fact, Texas boasted the second-highest 
number of clean energy jobs with over 
233,000 clean energy workers. 
Furthermore, Texas served as the nation’s 
largest contributor of wind-generated jobs in 
the nation, with over 25,000 Texas working on 
wind energy and an additional 192,000 jobs in 
energy efficient heating and cooling systems, 
solar power, and electric vehicles. 
Madam Speaker, investing in clean energy 
and properly training the workforce for this 
new economic sector is the key to creating 
more high-paying jobs in the United States. 
According to the Brookings Institute, jobs in 
green energy sectors often pay better. 
Even for hourly workers in jobs like elec-
tricians and carpenters, which require a lower 
threshold of formal education, around 50 per-
cent of workers have completed only high 
school or less, and yet they earn higher 
wages than their counterparts in other indus-
tries. 
I applaud the forethought of this bill and ap-
preciate its dual focus of addressing the fac-
tors that contribute to the current climate crisis 
as well as seizing the economic opportunities 
that this challenge presents. 
I urge my colleagues from both parties to 
join me in voting to pass H.R. 4447. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Madam Speaker, Republicans do sup-
port clean energy, but we oppose 
wasteful government spending and top- 
down policies that make energy more 
expensive, reduce consumer choice, and 
threaten our energy security. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a Statement of Administration 
Policy from the Office of the President 
of the United States recommending a 
veto. The letter states: ‘‘H.R. 4447 
would lead to higher energy costs and 
discourage innovation and entrepre-
neurship’’ and ‘‘fails on several other 
measures.’’ 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 4447—CLEAN ECONOMY JOBS AND INNOVA-
TION ACT—REP. O’HALLERAN, D–AZ, AND 9 CO-
SPONSORS 
The Administration opposes passage of 
H.R. 4447. The Administration supports clean 
energy, job development, and the innovation 
economy and adheres to a bottom-up energy 
philosophy 
that 
promotes 
free-markets, 
funds scientific research, and honors the 
choices of producers and consumers. This 
bill, however, would implement a top-down 
approach that would undermine the Admin-
istration’s deregulatory agenda and empower 
the government to select favored solutions 
while reinstating big-government policies 
and programs. 
H.R. 4447 would lead to higher energy costs 
and discourage innovation and entrepreneur-
ship. This legislation would bypass well-es-
tablished 
processes 
and 
procedures 
and 
would impose substantial, unwarranted costs 
on Federal, State, and local agencies and 
other key stakeholders in both public and 
private sectors. It would do so by setting 
rigid energy savings and water consumption 
reduction targets for Federal agencies, re-
quiring State and local governments to es-
tablish strict building codes that are not 
grounded in available technologies, and man-
dating 
a 
rigorous 
transition 
from 
hydrofluorocarbon use in the private heating 
and cooling sector. 
H.R. 4447 also fails on several other meas-
ures. Its proposed creation of new workforce 
development, training, and other related pro-
grams is unnecessary and would lead to 
greater fragmentation of the workforce sys-
tem and duplication of efforts between Fed-
eral agencies. To support the substantial 
costs of these programs, the bill would au-
thorize billions in new annual spending. It 
would also create a ‘‘green bank’’ that would 
subsidize projects similar to well-known fail-
ures like Solyndra. It ignores the importance 
of permitting reform while endorsing more 
government control and mandates on goods 
and products without consideration of the 
cost to consumers. It would also set up new 
mandates and regulations that would undo 
the Administration’s significant progress in 
lowering emissions and cleaning our air and 
water. Finally, H.R. 4447 would interfere 
with how we have been designing our own en-
ergy and environment destiny free from the 
reins of the Paris Climate Accord and inter-
national agreements or organizations that 
ignore the clear lessons that have led to 
American energy independence. 
Since January 2017, the United States has 
experienced a remarkable turnaround in its 
energy fortunes. In a few short years, our 
Nation has achieved energy independence 
and become a net energy exporter and a 
world energy powerhouse. We have increased 
exports of United States Liquefied Natural 
Gas (LNG) by nearly five-fold and issued 20 
long-term authorizations for LNG exports to 
non-free trade agreement countries. The 
United States is the number one producer of 
oil in the world and has maintained its sta-
tus as the top producer of nuclear power and 
the top producer of natural gas, as well as 
the world’s second-leading generator of wind 
and solar power. Crucially, while dominating 
in energy production, the United States con-
tinues to lead the world in reducing energy- 
related carbon dioxide emissions. Americans 
now have greater access to energy that is 
abundant, affordable, clean, and reliable, and 
the Administration looks forward to con-
tinuing our successful approach to build on 
these achievements. 
If H.R. 4447 were presented to the Presi-
dent, his advisors would recommend that he 
veto the bill. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a letter from the 
National Association of Home Builders 
in opposition to the bill due to the ex-
pansion of Federal building codes with-
out meaningful provisions to safeguard 
housing affordability. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
OF HOME BUILDERS, 
Washington, DC, September 21, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: On behalf of the more than 140,000 mem-
bers of the National Association of Home 
Builders (NAHB), I am writing to express 
strong opposition to H.R. 4447, the Clean 
Economy Jobs and Innovation Act. Any ex-
pansion of the federal government’s author-
ity in the code development process without 
meaningful provisions to safeguard housing 
affordability is invasive, unnecessary, and 
unwise. NAHB has designated opposition to 
H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and Inno-
vation Act. as a key vote. 
H.R. 4447 undermines the independence of 
the consensus-based code development proc-
ess by expanding the federal government’s 
role and authority. This legislation man-
dates that the Department of Energy (DOE) 
establish national energy savings targets for 
residential construction. After the consensus 
codes-writing bodies approve a new model 
code, DOE is mandated to submit proposals 
directly to the code developer, absent of 
stakeholder input, if DOE deems the federal 
target has not been met by the model code. 
H.R. 4447’s Washington-knows-best regime 
fails to meaningfully factor in housing af-
fordability, and it avoids the critical checks 
and balances that are conducted by the code 
development stakeholders. This top-down ap-
proach denies the consensus bodies the free-
dom of decision-making, rendering the code 
development process irrelevant and super-
fluous. 
Further, H.R. 4447 mandates a new regu-
latory and reporting regime for states to jus-
tify their decision to modify their building 
codes. The bill creates additional burdens by 
demanding that states that seek access to 
parts of a $200 million grant program must 
provide notice of whether they have met the 
bill’s compliance mandates or justify why 
they cannot comply—a requirement that 
must be met every two years. This burden-
some process significantly limits the ability 
of states and local governments to focus on 
adopting newer codes if they are constantly 
required to demonstrate compliance with 
this legislation. 
NAHB has long supported the development 
and implementation of reasonable, practical, 
and cost-effective building codes and stand-
ards. NAHB works as a partner with all lev-
els of government to encourage energy effi-
ciency; however, we strongly oppose federal 
mandates that are not cost-effective and 
jeopardize housing affordability. Failure to 
consider the true economic costs of required 
energy-use reductions in model energy codes 
and establish reasonable payback periods for 
these investments will result in fewer fami-
lies being able to achieve the American 
dream of homeownership. 
For these reasons, NAHB is designating a 
key vote in opposition to H.R. 4447, the Clean 
Economy Jobs and Innovation Act. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES W. TOBIN III.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4873 
September 23, 2020 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may 
I ask how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 4 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
the Energy and Commerce portion of 
this debate. 
I find it strange, Madam Speaker, 
that the Republicans pose as the de-
fenders of fiscal responsibility and low-
ering the deficit when they have what 
I consider a dismal track record on 
that issue. 
In 2017, they rushed through a tax 
bill that only rewarded the wealthiest 
while drowning our children’s future in 
a sea of debt. 
What do Republicans do when they 
create deficits by cutting taxes with-
out paying for it? They propose cuts to 
existing programs and reject funding 
for initiatives that benefit everyday 
Americans. 
To be clear, the Congressional Budg-
et Office estimates that this bill would 
add a whopping zero dollars to the def-
icit. I stress that again: zero dollars to 
the deficit. 
But if the Republicans are so intent 
on talking about costs, they ought to 
look at the cost of climate inaction 
and the economic harm of letting our 
competitors lead the global clean en-
ergy technology race. By the end of the 
century, lost wages from climate-re-
lated damages will reach $155 billion; 
mortality from extreme temperatures 
will surpass $140 billion; and coastal 
property damage will approach $120 bil-
lion. All told, the U.S. economy could 
lose more than 10 percent of its GDP. 
The economic benefits of action, in 
contrast, 
are 
significant: 
limiting 
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will 
yield more than $20 trillion in global 
economic benefits annually in the 
same timeframe. 
The bill before us lays a strong foun-
dation for reaching these scientifically 
set climate targets. Meanwhile, House 
Republicans are using tired gimmicks 
to argue about a deficit they created, a 
claim the CBO has thoroughly de-
bunked. If we continue to entertain 
these tried and true delay tactics, we 
are going to lose the global clean en-
ergy race and ensure the worst effects 
of climate change. We will saddle our 
economy and generations to come with 
the cost of extreme weather and reduce 
economic productivity. This is already 
happening, Madam Speaker. 
But if we reduce our carbon pollution 
and 
invest 
in 
clean 
energy 
tech-
nologies, then we can both protect our 
environment and grow our economy. 
We can lead the world in energy inno-
vation and lead our allies in addressing 
the climate crisis. 
b 1730 
Now, it has been 13 years since Con-
gress last passed major energy legisla-
tion. 
Since 
then, 
the 
world 
has 
changed. 
Our 
energy 
needs 
have 
evolved. Technologies have matured, 
and the need for climate action has be-
come urgent. The policies that govern 
how we produce, transport, store, and 
use energy are outdated. Our energy in-
frastructure is in desperate need of 
modernization, 
and 
Federal 
invest-
ments in energy-related research, de-
velopment 
and 
deployment 
aren’t 
meeting the needs of the 21st century. 
We need to transition to a clean, low- 
carbon economy, and that requires 
major investments and reforms to U.S. 
energy policy. 
Madam Speaker, this bill, the Clean 
Economy Jobs and Innovation Act, in-
cludes a broad suite of measures to en-
able that transition in a way that cre-
ates 
jobs, 
reduces 
pollution 
and 
unleashes American innovation. 
The scope of the legislation—I know 
there have been comments about the 
size of the bill—the scope of this bill 
reflects our commitment to delivering 
ambitious and long overdue upgrades 
to our Nation’s energy system. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues, given what we are faced with 
today, please, this is why both sides of 
the aisle should support the underlying 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce has expired. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the threat of cli-
mate change is one of the most urgent 
threats we face. 
Today, as we speak, vast portions of 
the West Coast of our Nation are con-
sumed with wildfires. To the south, our 
country has already been repeatedly 
pounded by tropical storms and hurri-
canes this year. Severe weather and 
dangerous heat waves are becoming in-
creasingly commonplace. Coral reefs 
around the world are dying off, threat-
ening whole ecosystems, and the ocean 
is becoming more acidic, which puts in 
peril an entire food chain vital to feed-
ing humanity. 
The threat of climate change is here, 
and it is long past time for Congress to 
take action to combat it. 
Responding to climate change is also 
an opportunity to reinvent our econ-
omy and propel it into the 21st cen-
tury. We have the opportunity to make 
America the leader in a host of clean 
energy technologies that will boost our 
economy and bring good, high-paying 
jobs. 
H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs 
and Innovation Act, will do just that 
by investing unprecedented amounts in 
clean energy research and develop-
ment. This bill also makes long over-
due investments in grid modernization 
and large-scale energy storage, which 
are key to allowing us to unlock the 
full potential of intermittent renew-
ables and other clean energy invest-
ments. 
Finally, this bill makes a critical in-
vestment in carbon capture and stor-
age technology. We have to recognize 
that today, as we speak, most of the 
energy used for electricity, transpor-
tation, and industrial processes in our 
Nation and across the world are still 
produced from fossil fuels. To realisti-
cally hope to combat the worst effects 
of climate change, we have to invest in 
technologies that can clean up the bulk 
of our current pollution sources, both 
here and abroad. 
All of the 16 bills that the Committee 
on Science, Space and Technology con-
tributed to this package are bipartisan 
pieces of legislation. This reflects the 
broad support of these bills in both the 
environmental and business commu-
nity—having received support from 
groups as diverse as the NRDC, the 
U.S. 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce, 
the 
League of Conservation Voters, and the 
National Association of Manufacturers. 
Madam Speaker, I want to take a 
moment to thank our current Sub-
committee on Energy chair, LIZZIE 
FLETCHER, and our former chair, CONOR 
LAMB, for their hard work in getting us 
to this point today. 
I also thank my fellow committee 
chairs, FRANK PALLONE and RAU´ L GRI-
JALVA, for their tireless work on H.R. 
4447 and their commitment to fighting 
for climate change. 
H.R. 4447 will not, on its own, prevent 
climate change, but it is a vital first 
step in addressing this threat. If we 
don’t take the first step, we will never 
get anywhere in our efforts to address 
this growing crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am disappointed 
that we are here today to consider a 
massive, impractical messaging bill in-
stead of voting on real clean energy so-
lutions. 
At the very first Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology hear-
ing this Congress, I committed to ad-
dressing climate change and global 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
through 
science and technology. 
My Republican colleagues and I have 
worked in good faith to create bipar-
tisan legislation that supports much- 
needed research and development into 
nascent, clean energy technologies. 
And when I say bipartisan, I mean 
truly bipartisan. My friend across the 
aisle will try to characterize H.R. 4447 
as bipartisan. But that is not strictly 
accurate. This bill was written without 
Republican input, and we were given 
one week to read and consider 900 pages 
of legislative text. 
Some provisions in this bill were con-
sidered and passed with bipartisan sup-
port at the committee level, but they 
were changed without consultation be-
fore they were included in this bill. 
Other provisions have a single Repub-
lican 
cosponsor, 
which 
technically 
makes them bipartisan, but certainly

September 23, 2020 
doesn’t indicate that there is wide-
spread support from both parties. 
Madam Speaker, we do have truly bi-
partisan bills on research and develop-
ment of clean energy technologies. We 
could be considering those today. 
For instance, the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology has a 
long history of strong support from 
both sides of the aisle for basic re-
search. 
Why? Because without fail, basic re-
search has generated breakthrough 
technologies that have revolutionized 
energy production in America, making 
it cleaner, cheaper, and more efficient. 
Basic research at our national labs is 
pioneering technologies that capture 
carbon emissions from coal, natural 
gas, batteries that store energy from 
intermittent energy sources like wind 
and solar, and advanced nuclear reac-
tors that can provide cleaner, more af-
fordable power. 
This is the kind of work that private 
industry generally can’t perform be-
cause it is simply too risky to invest 
in. Government-funded basic research 
makes groundbreaking discoveries and 
American 
industry 
then 
translates 
that 
into 
marketable 
technologies, 
making our economy stronger, our en-
ergy production more efficient. 
So why does this bill largely ignore 
basic research? H.R. 4447 doesn’t in-
clude any support for the Department 
of Energy’s Office of Science, which 
drives basic research and represents 
more than half of the Department’s en-
tire civilian Federal R&D portfolio. 
Instead, the bill before us today 
spends $35 billion to increase funding 
for every applied energy office at the 
DOE. While applied energy programs 
play an important role in improving ef-
ficiency in various industry sectors, 
they can only do so much. This bill is 
throwing money at renewable energy 
industries that are already mature and 
competitive, instead of investing in the 
next generation of clean energy tech-
nology. 
If you will pardon the farming anal-
ogy, this is like spending all your 
money to build a better plow instead of 
investing in a tractor. 
If we truly want clean, affordable, 
sustainable energy for Americans, we 
can and must do better than this. 
Madam Speaker, I have introduced 
legislation designed to boost American 
competitiveness and address climate 
change. H.R. 5685, the Securing Amer-
ican Leadership in Science and Tech-
nology Act, will double funding for the 
Office of Science, update our research 
facilities and infrastructure, and im-
prove tech transfer. It is a thoughtful 
investment in the future of American 
science. 
And there are other bipartisan bills 
we could be considering today, all of 
which have close Senate companions 
and strong bipartisan Senate interest: 
H.R. 4091, the ARPA-E Reauthoriza-
tion Act, was passed out of the Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology last year after both sides came 
together to negotiate a consensus bill 
that doubles our investment in ARPA- 
E’s high-risk, high-reward research 
while establishing guardrails to make 
sure we are using our limited research 
dollars wisely. 
H.R. 5347, the Advanced Geothermal 
Research and Development Act, au-
thorizes cutting-edge geothermal re-
search and development so we can take 
advantage of this vast and largely un-
tapped renewable resource. 
And H.R. 2986, the Better Energy 
Storage Technology Act, or the BEST 
Act, authorizes a crosscutting research 
and development program to accelerate 
high-priority 
energy 
storage 
tech-
nology. This is critical to more effi-
cient and consistent use of renewable 
technologies, like solar and wind. 
Giving any one of these bills consid-
eration today, would guarantee more 
progress on clean energy technology 
than this messaging bill. 
If we are serious about addressing cli-
mate change and providing Americans 
with clean, affordable energy, we need 
to be serious about the basic research 
that supports the goal. 
Madam Speaker, I hope we can put 
aside partisan performances like this 
and instead focus on supporting re-
search into the next generation of 
clean energy technology. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER). 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman JOHNSON for this 
opportunity and for her bipartisan 
leadership 
of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Science, Space, and Technology during 
this Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4447 and the important 
bills from the Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology that are in-
cluded in this bill. 
I am proud to represent Houston, 
Texas, the energy capital of the world, 
and our country leads the world in en-
ergy production and innovation be-
cause of the work that we do in Hous-
ton. We innovate, we create, we re-
search, and we power the world. 
H.R. 4447 will help ensure that we 
continue to do so with a meaningful in-
crease in the Federal resources nec-
essary to develop critical energy tech-
nologies that we will rely on in our en-
ergy mix into the next century. 
As the center of energy expertise and 
experience in the country, my con-
stituents in Houston are well-posi-
tioned to utilize the financial support 
provided through this bill and to help 
chart the course for our energy future. 
I am particularly glad that to expand 
research and development of large- 
scale demonstration of carbon capture, 
utilization and storage technologies, 
this package includes legislation I 
helped lead with my friend from Fort 
Worth, Mr. VEASEY, the Fossil Energy 
Research and Development Act. 
Critical work on carbon capture is 
going on right now in my district, and 
we have a real opportunity to reduce 
carbon emissions through these and 
other carbon capture efforts. 
To continue the important work of 
modernizing the use of fossil fuels, 
Houston companies and universities 
will be eligible to compete for an esti-
mated $14 billion in grant funds made 
possible by this bill. 
I am also glad that this bill includes 
the ARPA-E Reauthorization, legisla-
tion passed through our subcommittee 
to reauthorize funding for the Depart-
ment of Energy’s Advanced Research 
Projects Agency-Energy to help ad-
vance 
high-potential, 
high-impact 
technologies in the early stages of de-
velopment. 
While I support these and other im-
portant provisions of this bill, I recog-
nize that it is not a perfect bill. I am 
disappointed that my amendment to 
address some outstanding issues re-
lated to eminent domain and pipeline 
construction was not made in order. 
Our conversation about our energy 
future is vital for all of us. I look for-
ward to continuing my work with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
ensure that we are able to build the in-
frastructure we need to ensure the reli-
able 
delivery 
of 
American 
energy 
across the country and to collaborate 
on the essential research that we need 
and that we focused on so much in our 
committee work. 
In the energy capital of the world, we 
have unique and critical expertise to 
offer this conversation, and it will help 
us chart a path forward together. 
Madam Speaker, this bill represents 
some of the things we can do together. 
And for that reason, I will vote in favor 
of it, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same.

Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. WEBER), the ranking member of 
the Subcommittee on Energy. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, when I testified before the Rules 
Committee on Monday, I called the bill 
before us today the 900-page gorilla in 
the room. This is it right here. Bipar-
tisan? It is about as bipartisan as two 
wolves and a lamb discussing what to 
have for dinner. 
Let me tell you, as I stand before you 
today, Madam Speaker, H.R. 4447, the 
Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation 
Act, has only picked up speed as it 
charges dangerously toward passage. 
Starting with the backroom process, 
98 out of 176 submitted amendments 
were made in order, and there seems to 
be no rhyme or reason why. I person-
ally submitted two that were ruled out 
of order. One was on nuclear research— 
you want to talk about clean energy, 
green—one on nuclear research and de-
velopment, and one was a simple sense 
of Congress to ensure the long-term 
stability of fossil fuels, the bedrock of 
our Houston economy that the gentle-
woman from Texas was just talking 
about.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4875 
September 23, 2020 
Yet my Democrat colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle have said this 
bill is a simple marker meant to pass 
the House and meet the Senate and 
their energy package at conference to 
iron out the details. The problem with 
that is that they are ignoring the real 
bipartisan, bicameral legislation that 
has already been ironed out. 
Let’s use it. That would be a new 
wrinkle in their thinking. 
My nuclear R&D amendment, which 
won’t even have a chance to be voted 
on, is composed of language that has 
support in the Senate and closely mir-
rors their Nuclear Energy Leadership 
Act, or NELA, a priority of Senator 
MURKOWSKI. 
This just goes to show that today’s 
bill and the rushed process behind it is 
simply another messaging exercise, 
that the Democrats have no intention 
of negotiating to the point of it actu-
ally being signed into law. 
There is a novel thought. 
On top of the hasty procedure to rush 
through regular order, this bill has 
been falsely labeled bipartisan, as our 
great friend from Oklahoma said. I 
have listened to my Science Com-
mittee Democrat colleagues boast that 
all of our relevant sections are bipar-
tisan. Really? Yet, Madam Speaker, 
they won’t mention that 7 of the 17 
bills that are cosponsored by Repub-
licans are not even on the Science 
Committee. 
When 
the 
Republican 
committee 
members who sat through hearings 
heard from the stakeholders and tried 
to amend these bills decided to oppose 
the legislation, the Democrats looked 
for any name with an ‘‘R’’ next to it 
just to check the box of ‘‘working to-
gether.’’ 
Once again, I will say it. If my col-
leagues on the other side were serious 
about ensuring that this bill is more 
than just an opportunity for another 
sound bite, they would bring together 
the correct parties to reach a con-
sensus the President would actually 
sign into law. 
Madam Speaker, I am disappointed 
in this wasted opportunity. The United 
States has the ability to lead the world 
in technology. We have the ability to 
lead the world in technological solu-
tions, and we can produce clean energy 
sources for the next generation, those 
jobs the gentlewoman from Houston, 
Texas, was talking about. But, sadly, 
today’s bill misses that mark. 
For that reason, I urge my colleagues 
to oppose this legislation. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), 
a very dynamic member of the com-
mittee. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Clean Economy 
Jobs and Innovation Act, which in-
cludes my Water Power Research and 
Development Act. 
Oceans cover more than 70 percent of 
the surface of our planet. Waves, cur-
rents, and tides can be used as a plenti-
ful, renewable resource to power our 
homes, buildings, and communities. 
According to the Department of En-
ergy, there is enough kinetic energy in 
waves and tides along the U.S. coast-
line to meet a significant portion of 
our Nation’s power needs. 
As we transition to a 100 percent 
clean energy economy, we have the op-
portunity to capture the power of the 
ocean to help mitigate the climate cri-
sis. Oregon is at the forefront of ma-
rine energy, thanks to the leadership of 
Oregon State University, the Pacific 
Marine Energy Center, and pioneering 
businesses like Vigor. 
Last year, I visited the Ocean Energy 
device, built by workers at Vigor, be-
fore it was deployed off the shores of 
Hawaii for a pilot. It was not until I 
was standing in front of this enormous 
device that I grasped the scale of this 
resource and what we can gain from it. 
Marine energy has tremendous poten-
tial as one of the last untapped renew-
able energy sources, and Federal in-
vestment can help unlock it. My bipar-
tisan Water Power Research and Devel-
opment Act would reauthorize funding 
for research, development, demonstra-
tion, and commercialization of marine 
energy within the Department of Ener-
gy’s Water Power Technologies Office. 
This funding supports the leading re-
search and development efforts at Pa-
cific Marine Energy Center and will 
help their efforts to establish a wave 
energy test facility off the coast of Or-
egon. 
As a member of the Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis, I am 
pleased that this package includes 
many provisions from our bold, com-
prehensive, science-based Climate Cri-
sis Action Plan. 
I thank Chairwoman JOHNSON, Con-
gressman YOUNG, and Congressman 
DEUTCH for their support. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bipartisan energy package. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BABIN), the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Space and Aero-
nautics. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, like 
many of my Republican colleagues, I 
had what I believed to be an essential 
amendment ruled out of order. Simply 
put, my amendment ensured that fossil 
fuel power generation systems were not 
left behind as we try to navigate a 
clean energy future. 
From schools to hospitals, too much 
of our critical infrastructure is cur-
rently dependent on the systems that 
we already have in place. No matter 
which side of the aisle you are on, you 
cannot argue against the fact that fos-
sil fuels are the status quo right now 
and some of the very cheapest. 
But we don’t get the chance. We will 
not have the chance to express that 
support today. Instead, we will get this 
Democrat 
dream 
sheet 
forcefully 
passed, only to then die with no Senate 
interest. We are missing a golden op-
portunity for bipartisan solutions. 
Rather than turn off the light switch 
and force our economy into a blackout- 
ridden future of renewable sources, we 
need to utilize what is still readily 
available to us. That is why I am sup-
portive of carbon capture, utilization, 
and storage. 
I believe that, when developed, these 
technologies stand to only improve our 
fossil fuel power generation and even 
hold the potential to make it a clean 
energy source. But, as written, the leg-
islation before us lacks a focus on crit-
ical basic research that will advance 
these technologies. 
Areas like advanced computing, man-
ufacturing, and materials research will 
maximize our Nation’s fossil fuel re-
sources. Simply building more dem-
onstration projects similar to those al-
ready in existence, like Petra Nova in 
Texas or the National Carbon Capture 
Center in Alabama, will not develop 
next-generation membranes for direct 
air capture or novel solvents for en-
ergy-efficient gas separation. 
Additionally, this bill makes out-
rageous funding increases to the De-
partment of Energy’s Office of Fossil 
Energy. Currently funded at $750 mil-
lion for fiscal year 2020, this bill in-
creases the office’s budget to a whop-
ping $3 billion in fiscal year 2025 and 
spends $15 billion over the next 5 years. 
I am intrigued that some of my Dem-
ocrat colleagues who have stated their 
goal to completely phase out fossil 
fuels in the next 10 years would support 
such a massive increase. At the same 
time, however, I am encouraged to see 
more folks on the other side of the 
aisle acknowledge the long-term neces-
sity of fossil fuels in our clean energy 
future. 
I am unquestionably a staunch sup-
porter of fossil fuels and, specifically, 
the DOE Office of Fossil Energy, but 
we must act in a fiscally responsible 
manner. We cannot undertake this 
massive funding increase of 300 percent 
while simultaneously increasing ap-
plied energy programs like wind and 
solar. This is a disservice to the al-
ready strapped American taxpayer, and 
I urge its rejection. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
LUCAS, my friend from Oklahoma, for 
his leadership on the Science Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
SWALWELL). 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and 
Innovation Act. 
I want to thank Speaker PELOSI, Ma-
jority 
Leader 
HOYER, 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON, Chairman PALLONE, and mi-
nority leadership for working to put 
this bill on the floor today. 
I would like to focus on title X of 
this bill, which is an amended version 
of my bill, H.R. 4481, the Securing En-
ergy Critical Elements in American 
Jobs Act of 2019.

September 23, 2020 
Title X addresses energy-critical ma-
terials, which are important compo-
nents of advanced technologies, includ-
ing cellphones, laptops, jet engines, gas 
and wind turbines, solar panels, and 
state-of-the-art batteries. 
Our Nation relies on imports for at 
least 80 percent of its domestic needs 
for 21 of 35 of these critical materials. 
Some of these materials are difficult to 
mine cost effectively, and China con-
trols 80 percent of the supply. Ensuring 
a reliable, responsible, and stable sup-
ply of critical materials is vital to our 
national, energy, and economic secu-
rity. 
Previously, the Department of En-
ergy established a limited-term Crit-
ical Materials Institute to help ensure 
a reliable supply of energy-critical ma-
terials. Unfortunately, CMI has never 
been specifically authorized. The lan-
guage I offered in title X would prop-
erly authorize and codify CMI. 
Additionally, the DOE would be re-
quired to utilize the expertise of Fed-
eral agencies, the private sector, and 
our national laboratories. Two of these 
laboratories, Lawrence Livermore and 
Sandia, are both in my congressional 
district. 
I would also like to thank my col-
leagues for including this language in 
the package, and Adam Rosenberg on 
the committee staff for his work on 
this topic and Adeola Adesina on my 
staff for the long work on this topic, 
which has been for over 6 years in our 
office. 
Tomorrow, I will launch the Critical 
Materials Caucus with my friend from 
Pennsylvania, 
Republican 
GUY 
RESCHENTHALER, to continue work on 
this issue. 
I urge all Members to support H.R. 
4447. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. WALTZ), an esteemed member 
of the Science Committee. 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, H.R. 
4447, the Clean Economy and Jobs In-
novation Act, authorizes research and 
development activities across the De-
partment of Energy’s applied energy 
programs. 
As my colleagues have noted, while 
there are several bipartisan provisions 
in this package, they are outweighed, 
unfortunately, by partisan priorities in 
a rushed and irresponsible legislative 
process. 
I think, by now, we can all recognize 
how many missed opportunities for 
true bipartisanship have been com-
plicated by this approach. Critical min-
erals is certainly one of them. 
Critical minerals play a vital role in 
our everyday lives. Battery storage, de-
fense systems, healthcare equipment, 
medicines, things that impact U.S. na-
tional security, economic growth, and 
energy independence are all reliant on 
secure and safe access to critical min-
erals. 
However, 
currently, 
the 
United 
States is dependent on other countries 
for 31 of 35 critical minerals identified 
by the Department of the Interior; and 
of these, 14 are imported to the U.S. at 
a rate of 100 percent. 
On the list are lithium and graphite 
that power clean energy solutions, all 
of which are controlled by China. 
China, in fact, holds an overwhelming 
advantage in access to critical min-
erals, and the COVID–19 pandemic has 
made it dangerously clear that we can-
not, as a nation, rely on China for our 
essential resources. 
In May, I introduced H.R. 7061, the 
American Critical Mineral Exploration 
Act, which builds on the successes of 
the Senate’s American Mineral Secu-
rity Act by taking a more comprehen-
sive approach to onshoring these crit-
ical mineral supply chains. 
b 1800 
Earlier this year, it seemed like 
many of these provisions would be con-
sidered in good-faith negotiations with 
Science Committee Democrats, but un-
fortunately, despite our shared goals, 
we have had to pause negotiations in 
order to now consider this partisan 
messaging bill that is on the floor 
today. This is a waste of the taxpayers’ 
money, and a waste of the few remain-
ing legislative days. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. WALTZ). 
Mr. WALTZ. This is why I offered an 
amendment to replace the critical ma-
terials text in H.R. 4447 with the Amer-
ican Critical Mineral Exploration Act, 
and I was disappointed to see it was 
not made in order. I find this sur-
prising, since my bill serves as an ex-
panded companion to the Senate’s Crit-
ical Mineral Security Act, which was 
included in Chairwoman MURKOWSKI’s 
American Energy Innovation Act, and 
House Democrats claim the goal of 
H.R. 4447 is to mirror that package. We 
clearly see that is not to be the case. 
It is time to get back to work on 
clean energy solutions, on bipartisan 
solutions, and addressing China. It is 
time to act on our promises of biparti-
sanship. The majority has now can-
celed our agreements on the China 
Task Force, clean energy, and critical 
minerals. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this legislation. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER), a 
distinguished scientist and member of 
the committee. 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Clean Economy Jobs 
and Innovation Act. 
This act includes provisions from the 
bipartisan H.R. 2986, the Better Energy 
Storage Act, or BEST Act, led by me, 
Mr. CASTEN, Ms. HERRERA
BEUTLER, 
and Mr. GONZALEZ. 
These provisions set forth a cross-
cutting program at the Department of 
Energy to advance a suite of energy 
storage technologies. It directs DOE to 
establish a research and development 
program for cost-effective, sustainable 
energy storage systems, including test-
ing and validation activities. 
It directs the Department to develop 
a 5-year strategic plan to continue to 
identify and refine research goals for 
the program, and it would establish an 
energy storage demonstration program 
to help put more energy storage sys-
tems on the electric grid. 
Energy storage technologies take 
many 
forms, 
including 
batteries, 
pumped hydropower, thermal energy 
storage, or chemical energy stored as 
hydrogen. The development of cost-ef-
fective storage systems will help re-
duce the intermittency issues of renew-
able generation sources like solar and 
wind energy and will also help provide 
grid services, such as frequency regula-
tion to ensure the stability of the elec-
trical supply that consumers depend 
on. And they will begin to address the 
seasonal variation, which is the final 
frontier of energy storage technology. 
In my home district of Illinois, re-
searchers at Argonne National Lab are 
leading a national collaboration to ac-
celerate the development of advanced 
batteries, 
including 
novel 
cathode, 
anode, and electrolyte designs, as well 
as new materials synthesis and charac-
terization tools. 
And that is why I am so pleased to 
see provisions of the BEST Act in the 
Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation 
Act. 
I would be remiss if I did not ac-
knowledge the hard work of my col-
league on the Science Committee, Mr. 
CASTEN, who introduced the Promoting 
Grid Storage Act of 2019. His bill con-
tained many important provisions that 
have helped strengthen the version of 
the BEST Act that we are considering 
within this package. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me and vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
H.R. 4447. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Indi-
ana (Mr. BAIRD), the ranking member 
of the Subcommittee on Research and 
Technology. 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in opposition to H.R. 4447, the 
Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation 
Act. 
My reason for this is like many of my 
Republican colleagues, it has a mis-
guided focus on applied energy, and al-
most no focus or attention to basic re-
search. 
The area I am concerned about is the 
lack of attention on biological and en-
vironmental research, BER. 
Just a few weeks ago, the Science 
Committee held a hearing on the De-
partment of Energy’s BER office. We 
heard how their world-class user facili-
ties and bioenergy research centers 
bring together researchers and data for 
open collaboration, not seen anywhere 
else in the world.

authorizes these user facilities and bio-
energy research centers, along with a 
host of other basic research provisions. 
My point is: That there are produc-
tive alternatives that have the right 
focus and are ready to be passed, in-
stead of this partisan package in front 
of us today. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB), 
a hardworking member of the com-
mittee. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank the chairwoman for bringing 
this bill to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I come from west-
ern Pennsylvania, home of the first oil 
well, home of coal and steel, home of 
the first nuclear power plant, home of 
the fracking revolution, and most im-
portantly, home of the people who 
built all of these things. 
And it is as a western Pennsylvanian 
today, not as a Democrat or Repub-
lican, but as a western Pennsylvanian 
that I am proud to have supported and 
contributed provisions to this bill. 
Both Democrats and Republicans will 
vote for this bill tomorrow—they will. 
And that is how it should be. 
Somehow people got the idea that en-
ergy was one more topic that should be 
politicized in America, and they are 
wrong. The future of energy is about 
jobs, not red jobs, not blue jobs, just 
jobs. And we know how to create jobs 
in America when we use our govern-
ment to win the race to new tech-
nologies. That is why I have never 
thought the best analogy here is the 
New Deal, it is the Manhattan Project. 
Back then, when we had a threat 
from outside our country, it required 
us to double down on all the nuclear 
science and then get it out of the lab 
and into the factories, into the power 
plants, into the construction camps. 
We created jobs. 
And just like that was a competition 
against Germany, and just like today, 
we still thank the Greatest Generation 
for refusing to tolerate Germany beat-
ing us to the bomb. Today, we should 
refuse to tolerate China beating us to 
those jobs. 
Someone will get these jobs. Some-
one will build the next advanced nu-
clear reactor. Someone will figure out 
how to build a gas-fired power plant 
with carbon storage, and someone will 
win the race on batteries. It should be 
us. And this bill will give us a leg up in 
each one of those technologies. There 
is no more time to waste. 
My colleagues across the aisle have 
raised fair points about their own ideas 
and legislation, but make no mistake, 
this bill is a blueprint for more jobs, 
less carbon, more science, less par-
tisanship, and we should all pass it 
without delay. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. FULCHER). 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
stand in opposition to H.R. 4447. A 
clean energy future is not possible 
without advanced nuclear energy. 
We are in a global competition. Rus-
sia is building seven reactors in Asia, 
has 22 more under contract in Asia and 
Europe, and proposals to put more in 
Africa. China is on pace to double nu-
clear capacity by 2030 and has stated it 
wants to build 6 to 8 reactors a year. In 
the U.S. we are currently building two. 
If we fall behind, so does our national 
security and geopolitical standing. 
That is why I introduced the Next 
Generation Nuclear Advancement Act, 
which was ruled out of order as an 
amendment. All sections of this act, 
the Nuclear Energy Strategic Plan, and 
Integrated Energy and Light Water Re-
actor Programs, have Senate counter-
parts with bipartisan support. 
These provisions need to be inserted 
for legislation to have a chance at be-
coming law; anything less is only use-
ful as a social media post. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. LURIA). 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this bill, H.R. 4447, 
and applaud the inclusion of nuclear 
power as a critical element of our en-
ergy future and our national security. 
As an engineer who operated nuclear 
reactors in the Navy, I saw firsthand 
that nuclear power, when deployed 
safely and responsibly, can play a key 
role in our future as a zero-carbon en-
ergy source. Advanced nuclear designs 
carry potential for our economy, our 
national security, and electrical grid, 
as they can provide a steady source of 
clean energy and reduce carbon emis-
sions. 
The Nuclear Energy Leadership Act 
section of this bill would jump-start in-
novation and advanced nuclear energy 
by authorizing $55 million per year 
through 2025 for an advanced reactor 
technologies program and establish the 
University Nuclear Leadership Pro-
gram to develop our future nuclear 
workforce. 
The inclusion of my bipartisan legis-
lation, the Nuclear Energy Leadership 
Act, in this bill will facilitate the path 
to market for advanced reactors and 
help the U.S. maintain international 
leadership in nuclear technology and 
safety. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chair-
woman JOHNSON
and Representative 
LAMB, and the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee for working 
with me on this important legislation, 
and for including the important ele-
ment of nuclear power in this energy 
package. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, as I said in my 
opening statement, as ranking member 
of the Science Committee, I am dis-
appointed we are debating a messaging 
bill today, rather than a substantive 
bipartisan bill, the kind that we 
worked on to address clean energy and 
climate change. 
I would like to thank my Republican 
colleagues, 
Energy 
Subcommittee 
Ranking Member WEBER, Space Sub-
committee Ranking Member BABIN, 
Research 
and 
Technology 
Ranking 
Member BAIRD, and Representatives 
WALTZ, CRENSHAW, and FULCHER, and 
many others for their hard work in 
championing energy R&D issues that 
will truly deliver on the promise of our 
clean energy future. 
It is not too late to make progress. If 
there is one thing to take away from 
this, it is that Science Committee Re-
publicans are ready and willing to 
work with our shared priorities. 
So let’s set aside this bipartisan mes-
saging exercise and start having seri-
ous conversations about supporting the 
basic research needed to make real 
progress in clean energy. 
Madam Speaker, I once again urge 
my colleagues to oppose this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Let me just simply say, our planet 
screams out for our help. This is not 
intended to be a Democratic exercise. 
It is a stand for a real need to give at-
tention to the climate change we are 
experiencing that can only get worse 
without us doing something. 
So I extend my hand to the Repub-
lican members of this committee to 
join us and understand that it is not 
just a political ploy that we are trying 
to do here, it is time for us to address 
climate change. We are suffering too 
much and losing to many unnecessary 
spent dollars dealing with the situation 
that we are in now. 
The people are depending on us to 
take the lead and address the problem. 
So I plead with you, join with us. This 
is not partisan; it is to save our planet. 
I ask you to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, 
further consideration of H.R. 4447 is 
postponed.

HONORING JAMES BENNETT 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to recognize the life of 
James Bennett. 
James was a loved, trusted, compas-
sionate, and hardworking young man. I 
had the pleasure and honor of knowing 
him his entire life. 
James was as gifted athletically as 
he was academically, a wrestler who 
notched 95 wins in high school and was 
also selected into the prestigious Na-
tional Honor Society and graduated 
from Rowan University in south Jer-
sey. 
The positivity and the energy that he 
brought to this world will be missed by 
everyone who had the pleasure of ever

knowing him. I know that I personally 
miss him very much. 
We all wish we had more time on this 
Earth with you, James, but know we 
know that you are looking down on 
your mom and your dad, your entire 
family, and your friends, and you are 
in Heaven right now. 
Rest in peace, my friend, and God 
bless you.

RECOGNIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
GARCI´A of Illinois). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 3, 
2019, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
ROY) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, last week, 
I took some time on the floor here in 
the House of Representatives to recog-
nize our important law enforcement 
community and what they mean to the 
American people and why this body 
should stand alongside, behind, and in 
defense of our law enforcement com-
munity unapologetically. 
Since speaking on the floor last 
week, I have been, frankly, inundated 
by 
emails, 
Instagram 
messages, 
Facebook messages, tweets, phone calls 
from I think all 50 States. The video 
from the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives has been seen almost 8 
million times. I, frankly, was blown 
away, but it just tells you how many 
Americans are looking for the leader-
ship of their country to stand by and 
stand alongside our law enforcement 
community. 
Some of the messages that we re-
ceived—and this isn’t about me, and 
this isn’t about any Member of this 
body, but these were some of the mes-
sages we received. 
This was sent to me: ‘‘Your speech 
about the 43 officers was moving. My 
father is a police officer. The world 
would make me feel as though I 
shouldn’t be proud of that, let alone 
give any support to the police. Thank 
you.’’ 
Another message: ‘‘Thank you for ad-
dressing the 43 law enforcement offi-
cers who have been killed this year so 
far. I am a law enforcement officer’s 
wife for over 20 years. My husband is a 
phenomenal human being and law en-
forcement officer. He has spent his life 
protecting strangers. I won’t rant. You 
know how we are living right now,’’ she 
said. ‘‘I just wanted to thank you for 
being bold and brave and having his 
six.’’ 
For the record, I don’t consider my-
self bold or brave. I just consider my-
self a representative of constituents 
who share my complete disbelief that 
this body refuses to take any action, to 
do anything as a body in unison to de-
fend and stand alongside our law en-
forcement community. 
It is an abject failure by the Speaker 
of the House of Representatives and 
this body that we have not passed a 
resolution; we have not joined to-
gether; we have not stood on the steps 
of the Capitol; we have not done a 
thing to stand alongside our law en-
forcement community who keep us safe 
every day. And I think that is an em-
barrassment. It is an embarrassment 
that the people’s House refuses to do 
that. 
Another message: ‘‘I start off first 
saying I am law enforcement, and I 
want to continue saying thank you for 
your support. I have watched your C– 
SPAN video so many times, and it gets 
me every time. It is just nice to have 
some people out here backing us.’’ 
Again, this is not about me. I wish 
there were 435 Members sitting here on 
the floor right now together, all doing 
that for these people, for those law en-
forcement officers. 
Another message: ‘‘Thank you, sir, 
for your speech in the House. We at the 
Nevada Highway Patrol were rocked by 
our first line of duty death since 2006. 
On March 27, 2020, Sergeant Ben Jen-
kins stopped on a snowy Nevada rural 
road to help a stranded motorist. After 
his attempts to get the motorist’s vehi-
cle unstuck failed, the motorist pulled 
out a .308 rifle and shot Sergeant Jen-
kins in the right shoulder. Sergeant 
Jenkins retreated to the back of his ve-
hicle, severely wounded, got ‘shots 
fired’ over the radio before he col-
lapsed. The suspect walked up to Ser-
geant Jenkins as he lay in the cold, 
snowy Nevada highway and shot him in 
the head. Sergeant Ben Jenkins died 
doing what any trooper would do when 
they see a stranded motorist. He would 
have helped anyone. He lost his life 
doing it.’’ This person said: ‘‘Your 
speech was impactful. Thank you for 
being our voice.’’ 
I don’t know the race of any of these 
people. I don’t. I don’t know the race of 
the officers. I don’t know the race of 
the perpetrators. I don’t know the race 
of any other victims. I literally have 
no idea. But these are people from all 
over the country, thousands calling in, 
tweeting, checking. They are hungry 
for a body that is supposed to represent 
them in the people’s House to stand up 
and just say a simple thank-you. Just 
say a simple, ‘‘We have got your back.’’ 
Since I spoke just under a week ago, 
three more officers have been killed in 
the line of duty. I read all the names of 
the 43 who have been killed last week. 
Here are three more: Investigator Luis 
Mario Herrera, on September 7; Deputy 
Sheriff Ryan Phillip Hendrix, on Sep-
tember 10; Sergeant Alvin R. Sugranes- 
LeBron, on September 16. 
That means we are up to 46 officers 
who have been killed thus far in 2020, a 
53 percent increase from the same pe-
riod in 2019. 
As I said last week, eight categorized 
as premeditated murder, two were a 
victim of unprovoked attacks, eight 
fatal shots were fired at point-blank 
range zero to 5 feet from the officer, 
eight shot in the front of the head, two 
in the back of the head, six in the neck, 
nine in the chest. 
We have an over 50 percent increase 
in officers killed in the line of duty, 
the law enforcement officers who rep-
resent the thin blue line between us 
and anarchy. 
My grandfather was the chief of po-
lice of Sweetwater, Texas. My great- 
great-grandfather was a Texas Ranger. 
I was proud to be an assistant United 
States attorney working with the law 
enforcement community. 
Where is the people’s House? Again, 
sitting here at 6:23, we had three votes 
this afternoon in series. We marched in 
here, we voted. We don’t have any de-
bate. We vote, we clean, we vote, we 
stand out on the steps, and we walk 
out. And, thus, has been the people’s 
House for the last 190 days. 
It is an embarrassment. We are sit-
ting here in an empty Chamber. We 
haven’t passed a PPP extension bill. 
We haven’t done the hard work of try-
ing to make sure our small businesses 
that are struggling in this environment 
survive. We sure as heck have not been 
on the floor of this body engaged in 
any kind of effort to pass a resolution, 
to sit here and have a moment of si-
lence, an understanding, a recognition 
for any member of the law enforcement 
community. 
With all due respect to the other 
side, where is the Speaker? Where is 
the Speaker of the House? Last Thurs-
day, after a number of us gave speeches 
about this issue, after I gave a speech, 
Speaker PELOSI came down to the floor 
of the House and said a handful of 
words: ‘‘We support peaceful dem-
onstrations. We participate in them. 
They are part of the essence of our de-
mocracy.’’ She went on: ‘‘That does not 
include looting, starting fires, or riot-
ing. They should be prosecuted. That is 
lawlessness.’’ 
Well, congratulations to the Speaker 
of the House for recognizing the rule of 
law. The body that passes laws, includ-
ing our Federal criminal laws, the body 
that represents the people, all 330 mil-
lion of them, the Speaker of that body 
came all the way down to the floor of 
the House of Representatives to ex-
plain to us that she supports the basic 
fundamentals of the rule of law but did 
not say a word about law enforcement 
and backing them up, did not say a 
word about calling out Antifa or BLM 
or any organization behind a lot of the 
activities going on around our country, 
endangering our communities, burning 
down stores, wrecking people’s lives, 
putting people in danger, letting people 
get killed, having officers put in dan-
ger. 
I read through a number of officers 
who have been killed throughout this 
process, and what are we doing? 
When we had a debate back in June 
when it was politicized, Senator SCOTT 
sent over legislation. Did we have any 
robust debate about that? No. We 
haven’t had a single vote on an amend-
ment on the floor of the House since 
May of 2016, and that is an absolute 
embarrassment. 
We have groups of people who sit up 
in the Rules Committee. They throw 
down a bill on the floor of the House of

Representatives, and we are supposed 
to march down here like lemmings, 
push a button yes or no, and then let 
leadership go out on the steps and give 
a press conference. 
How is that representation? Where is 
the Speaker? It is not enough to come 
down and give lip service for 10 seconds 
about riots and about how those are 
lawless but not come down here and ac-
tually recognize our men and women in 
uniform who are serving us in blue 
across the country. 
Or how about our Border Patrol? How 
about ICE? Many of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle like to go 
around saying defund ICE, abolish ICE, 
take away resources from Border Pa-
trol and ICE. 
Have they walked a mile in the shoes 
of the Border Patrol or ICE that I know 
on the border in Texas, where cartels 
have operational control of our border 
still to this day right now? We just had 
apprehensions of about 45,000 in Au-
gust, the second highest number in the 
last 6 years, second only to last year. 
Do you know why that number is low 
right now? Guess. Title 42 protecting 
our health because of the virus. Our 
men and women in uniform on the bor-
der of the United States serving their 
country, my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle say abolish them, get 
rid of them, when they are securing the 
border 
of 
the 
United 
States 
outmanned, 
outgunned. 
They 
can’t 
navigate the Rio Grande. 
I would invite any of my colleagues 
to come down along with my Demo-
cratic friend HENRY CUELLAR. He and I 
have cosponsored legislation to clear 
cane and open roads along the Rio 
Grande. Why can’t we do that? We 
could do that in a matter of seconds 
right on this floor and give our Border 
Patrol and give our ICE agents the 
ability to actually stop and stem the 
tide of the horrors being perpetrated by 
cartels along our border. 
We duck our head in the sand and ig-
nore it while little girls get raped and 
abused on the journey through Mexico; 
while we find stash houses with 50 peo-
ple in basements in Houston; while 
families get held hostage for ransom; 
while meth comes pouring across our 
border, fentanyl, cocaine, large quan-
tities, pouring across our border; all 
while we have been shutting down our 
way of life, causing people to have ex-
treme mental health concerns and 
issues and addictions being fed heavily 
by 
the 
Chinese 
running 
right 
up 
through the gut through Mexico, right 
into Texas, right into our country, and 
what are we doing? Playing politics 
with our border instead of doing what 
any sovereign nation would do, which 
is defend the border of the United 
States for the interests of our commu-
nity and the migrants who seek to 
come here, who are being abused, who 
are being sold into the sex trade, who 
are being held ransom by cartels. 
b 1830 
There is a bloody civil war going on 
along the border along the Rio Grande, 
and my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle come out and say, ‘‘kids in 
cages’’; they come out and say, ‘‘drink-
ing out of toilets.’’ 
It is just simply not true. I have been 
to these facilities. We have all been to 
these facilities. We know it is not true. 
The Speaker knows it is not true. Yet 
that is the stated position of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. 
‘‘Kids in cages,’’ the very barriers put 
up by the previous President and the 
previous President’s administration for 
what? To separate kids, to separate 
them from other dangerous individuals 
who may or may not be their family 
members, people coming across claim-
ing to be their parents. We don’t know. 
What are we supposed to do, just 
take them and throw them to the 
wolves? Or maybe we should have a 
system for trying to figure it out. 
And you go down there and you look 
and you see what our Border Patrol 
agents are doing, and you see what our 
ICE agents are doing: working hard to 
try to figure it out when you have 
900,000 people apprehended in fiscal 
year 2019. 
I didn’t make that number up. All 
right? This is how many people were 
apprehended. I am not talking about 
the ones who got away. I am talking 
about the ones who were apprehended, 
coming into our facilities, and we have 
to manage it. 
Where is the Speaker? Where is the 
Speaker for any member of our law en-
forcement community on the streets in 
any city in America, Federal, State, or 
local, Border Patrol, ICE? Where is the 
Speaker? Completely MIA, wandering 
around D.C. no doubt raising money for 
the D triple C or something to go have 
another political speech, but sure as 
heck not on the floor of the House of 
Representatives standing alongside law 
enforcement. 
Let’s consider the grand successes of 
this body of the House of Representa-
tives under Speaker PELOSI. 
Proxy voting. For the first time in 
the history of this body, under the 
Speaker of the House, this body, led by 
Democrats, is allowing proxy voting. 
Now, for those of you at home, what 
that means is that you can have a 
Member, as has happened, vote from a 
boat—get on a screen, log in, and vote 
from a boat. That happened. 
This body, if you are elected to it, 
you cannot delegate that which has 
been delegated to you under the Con-
stitution of the United States, by the 
people, that sacred obligation to rep-
resent them, you cannot delegate that 
to another. That is plainly and clearly 
unconstitutional. 
I look forward to that question get-
ting to the Supreme Court. I am proud 
to be a part of litigating that. I look 
forward to getting it to the Supreme 
Court so we can actually answer that 
question. 
We don’t need the Court to answer it. 
This body can answer it. It is plainly 
unconstitutional. 
Yet for the first time in our history, 
we have allowed and enabled proxy vot-
ing where a Member of this body can 
allow somebody else in this body to 
cast a vote for him or her. 
For two centuries, through the yel-
low fever of 1783, which took out 10 per-
cent of the population of Pennsylvania, 
the burning of the Capitol during the 
War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish 
flu of 1918, both World Wars, 9/11, Con-
gress never flinched from its constitu-
tional duty to assemble in the Capital 
City. 
Ten percent of Philadelphia in 1793— 
think about that—was wiped out. They 
found a way to meet. They found a way 
to carry out their solemn obligation. 
The Speaker continues to refuse reg-
ular order. I have already referred to 
that. We bypass the committee process, 
block amendments for every bill, effec-
tively shutting out participation for 
rank-and-file Members of both parties 
of the House. 
Just yesterday we voted on a con-
tinuing resolution to fund government 
$1.6 trillion, ladies and gentlemen. You 
are sitting back at home. Yes, another 
number stuck in front of a trillion— 
$1.6 trillion. 
Your august body, the House of Rep-
resentatives, representing you, had ap-
proximately 20 minutes to review the 
continuing resolution funding $1.6 tril-
lion of government, busting caps of 
busted caps already busted. 
That is your House of Representa-
tives, ladies and gentlemen, and I don’t 
think you should accept it. I don’t 
think the American people should ac-
cept this level of complete incom-
petence and disgrace that we are seeing 
on the floor of the House of Represent-
atives. 
Twenty minutes. 
How about that 72-hour rule? We like 
that? We adopt the rules every time we 
come into Congress. Seventy-two hours 
you must have to read legislation, they 
say. Does that ever happen? Let’s be 
honest. Does that ever happen? No. 
And when you go home and you talk 
to your constituents, they say: Why is 
Washington broken? 
I say: Because we never sit down at a 
table, roll our sleeves up, and do the 
work that you do in your home, that 
you do in your business, that you do in 
your nonprofit, that you do in your 
church to actually balance your budg-
et, to actually make tough decisions. 
We never do that. 
Democrats and Republicans should be 
appalled at the way this body has been 
operating. 
We should have debate. We should 
have votes. We should have amend-
ments. 
What are we afraid of? Bring your 
amendments down. I will vote, and I 
will go face my constituents and ex-
plain why. 
And you know what? There will be 
tough votes, and they will be used 
against you. 
And you know what? That is the 
process. 
I have already mentioned that the 
Speaker refuses to stand for law en-
forcement. It took months to even

come 
down 
here 
to 
condemn 
the 
looting and the rioting and the vio-
lence, and she still won’t condemn 
BLM or antifa. 
In July, the Speaker’s response to 
the chaos on the streets was: ‘‘People 
will do what they do.’’ 
Well, boy, oh boy, is that blowing the 
socks off of our law enforcement com-
munity getting the great leadership 
from the Speaker of the House that 
‘‘people will do what they do.’’ Well, 
they sure will if we don’t stand behind 
our law enforcement community and 
stand up for the rule of law. 
The Speaker infamously pushed an 
impeachment inquiry without a vote 
on the House floor for the first time in 
history. Now, that has played out. I 
haven’t heard much about impeach-
ment over the last 7 months. 
It gripped the Nation, supposedly. I 
think it gripped the body. I think it 
gripped half of this body. 
We spent 6 months essentially shut-
ting this Chamber down to pursue that 
inquiry, and now the Speaker is talk-
ing about impeachment again. 
The Speaker has refused to condemn 
the blatant anti-Semitism that some in 
her own party have used, and she her-
self has referred to Republicans as ‘‘en-
emies of the people,’’ the Speaker of 
the House. 
The Speaker recently referred to the 
peace agreements, the historic peace 
agreements between Israel and Bahrain 
and Israel and UAE—these are mas-
sively 
successful, 
important 
peace 
agreements. She referred to them as 
‘‘distractions’’—Israel, our great ally 
in the Middle East. 
These were great agreements. This is 
historic stuff. 
There are other countries considering 
it. Why? Because we led. 
We moved our Embassy to Jeru-
salem, and other countries followed. 
Why? Because we took out Soleimani. 
And what did the Speaker do? She 
wanted to condemn the President for 
taking out Soleimani, a murderous 
thug who targeted American soldiers. 
It was great that the President of the 
United States took out Soleimani. 
And now, as I said, the Speaker is 
threatening impeachment 2.0. Why? Be-
cause President Trump is daring—hold 
on, here it comes—daring to do what 
every President in the history of this 
country has done when there is a va-
cancy on the Supreme Court in the 
fourth year of their term, every one, 29 
times. 
That the President would exercise 
Article II authority to nominate an in-
dividual to fill a vacancy on the United 
States Supreme Court, for that—for 
that—the Speaker is suggesting we 
should consider Articles of Impeach-
ment 2.0. 
It is facially absurd. It is not an 
arrow in a quiver. It is facially absurd. 
It is an embarrassment to this institu-
tion. It is an embarrassment to this 
Congress. 
We should have an open and vital de-
bate about all of these issues we are 
talking about right here, amending, de-
bating, voting. No, no, no. We are going 
to go rattle that impeachment and go 
give some press conferences. This is 
just politicizing the process. 
Now, we have seen that before. We 
have seen this many times before, the 
politicization of this process. 
I was a lawyer on the Senate Judici-
ary Committee in 2003. I had the great 
honor and privilege of serving Senator 
JOHN CORNYN. I spent 5 years as a law-
yer on that committee working on a 
host of issues. One of the issues I 
worked on was nominations. 
Now, you might be asking: Who are 
these two women? 
Well, Judge Janice Rogers Brown 
was—if my memory serves correctly; I 
don’t have any notes; I am doing this 
from memory—a supreme court justice 
in California who was nominated to the 
Ninth Circuit. Priscilla Owen was nom-
inated to the Fifth Circuit. 
Now, in 2003, the Democrats in the 
United States Senate sought to stop— 
that is, filibuster—stop their nomina-
tions. 
Their great crimes? They were con-
servative women. And in one case, a 
minority conservative woman. Those 
were their great crimes in 2003, ladies 
and gentlemen. 
And that is what your Democrats in 
the United States Senate did: attack-
ing them, tearing them down, blowing 
up the very process that people are 
talking about right now, the confirma-
tion process. They attacked them, 
these two public servants. 
I met both of them. Very kind, nice 
people being ruthlessly attacked for 
simply being conservative women, or a 
conservative minority woman. 
We can’t have that. We can’t have 
those dastardly Republicans appointing 
someone who doesn’t fit the narrative 
by my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, but yet that is precisely what 
happened in 2003. 
What have we seen since? We saw the 
complete horror show that was the 
Kavanaugh hearing 2 years ago, an 
utter disgrace by Senate Democrats. 
But I also remember the 2005 con-
firmation of Sam Alito. I also was 
there for the Roberts confirmation. 
Ask Justice Alito’s lovely wife, Mar-
tha-Ann, how she feels about the way 
her husband was treated, attacked, 
torn down, vilified through his con-
firmation 
proceedings 
by 
Senator 
SCHUMER. 
It was vitriolic. It wasn’t just high-
lighting differences of views or judicial 
philosophy; it was targeting him per-
sonally and attacking. But that is the 
playbook that I have to suggest is the 
routine playbook for my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle in the United 
States Senate. 
Of course, that wasn’t the first time. 
We all know, in 1987, there was a new 
verb in the lexicon of the confirmation 
process called borking, because Judge 
Bork was borked. They took down 
Judge Bork. 
And, again, what was his great 
crime? He was a constitutional con-
servative. He was a constitutionalist. 
That was his great crime. 
It took a mere 4 years later for Jus-
tice Thomas, in his own words, to re-
ceive a ‘‘high-tech lynching.’’ 
b 1845 
I say to the ladies and gentlemen 
watching, watch the video. It is on my 
Twitter feed. You can go find it. Google 
it. Go watch the great biopic. You can 
go find that on PBS. There is a great 
documentary on the life of Clarence 
Thomas who was born into the relative 
poverty of Savannah, Georgia. He was 
raised by his grandfather. Read his 
book, ‘‘My Grandfather’s Son.’’ 
A life overcoming many obstacles to 
end up at Yale, and then to end up at 
the Supreme Court. And if you remem-
ber at his confirmation hearings, what 
did he say? He said: This isn’t worth it 
for the court at the hearings, when he 
was being pilloried, his character as-
sassinated. He said, You know what, 
the Supreme Court isn’t worth it. 
But you know what was worth it and 
the reason he came back, and the rea-
son he shoved it right back down the 
throats of those members of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, including, by the 
way, Chairman Joe Biden, because it 
was his character. It was his name, the 
name that he had inherited, and he had 
from his grandfather that loved him 
and raised him. 
It was his name and he brought that 
Senate Judiciary Committee to its 
knees. And we should be grateful for it 
because he has been an excellent jus-
tice on the United States Supreme 
Court, and he did not deserve the at-
tacks that he got. 
Let’s talk about the person to the 
left of Justice Thomas, Miguel Estrada. 
Does anybody know that name, remem-
ber that name? Miguel Estrada is a 
good human being. He is a good man. 
He was also a nominee in the Bush ad-
ministration in 2003, during that same 
time that I was describing with Janice 
Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen, and 
there were others. 
I think there were some 50 that were 
filibustered during that time. I can’t 
remember. Do you know why Miguel 
Estrada was filibustered? Ultimately, 
he was stopped. A deal was cut, and 
Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla 
Owen ended up on the bench. Miguel 
Estrada was not fortunate. 
Miguel Estrada was targeted and 
stopped precisely because he is His-
panic. That is a known truth in Wash-
ington, D.C., but nobody talks about it. 
Do you know why? 
Because of concerns about how a 
leaked memo was found. It was a 
leaked memo that was found on a serv-
er. It is the stuff that would be great 
for ethics classes in law school or 
undergrad about what folders are open 
and who can look at them and who can 
see them. It is a reasonable debate. 
But the fact of the matter is, there 
was a memo by Senate Democratic 
leadership saying we must stop him be-
cause he is a Hispanic. I say to the la-
dies and gentlemen who are watching

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4881 
September 23, 2020 
this, this is what is wrong with Wash-
ington, D.C. And what are we going to 
see transpire in the coming weeks? 
I hope we have a great celebration of 
Justice Ginsburg’s life this week. Obvi-
ously, it has transformed very quickly 
into what is next, but I hope we will 
stop and celebrate. 
But as we go forward, we know what 
is going to happen. We know it as sure 
as we are sitting here, as sure as the 
Sun comes up tomorrow that it doesn’t 
matter who the President nominates. 
He or she will be attacked viscously, 
violently. 
We certainly know that if Judge Bar-
rett is nominated, she will be attacked 
viciously. Her faith will be attacked vi-
ciously. The fact that she is a proud 
mom to, I think, seven, of whom I 
think two are adopted, she will be at-
tacked. 
Why is this? It is because we have 
made Washington, D.C., and its institu-
tions too consequential to the lives of 
Americans in a country in which we 
are supposed to live freely. 
We have taken issues that you are 
supposed to work out and debate at the 
State legislature and the local level 
and, at most, in this body, in this 
Chamber, in the Senate, and we have 
placed them into the hands of nine 
judges. 
So now every June everybody waits 
with bated breath outside of the Su-
preme Court Chamber. What great pro-
nouncement shall come down from on 
high? 
Why do we choose to live that way? 
Why don’t we choose to make decisions 
in this body? 
Why don’t we the people of this body 
make Article I great again? Why don’t 
we make Congress work again? 
I introduced legislation a year and a 
half ago called the Article I Act, de-
signed to take power away from the 
President and expand power here in 
times of emergencies, so you can’t have 
situations like we have now where over 
the last 30 years vast numbers of emer-
gencies have just been perpetual. And 
we still operate and give the executive 
branch authority to operate under 
these emergencies, 30 years later. That 
is facially absurd. 
Why don’t we fix that? I have had 
conversations with friends and col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who are interested in doing that. Why 
isn’t the Speaker? 
Look, I did that with a Republican 
President in the White House who is 
trying to secure the border, a propo-
sition with which I agree not just a lit-
tle, but strongly. It is our job to secure 
the border of the United States. I fully 
support the President in securing the 
border of the United States. 
I fully agree that it is an emergency 
at our border. I fully agree that we 
need to stop the cartels. I fully agree 
that we need to protect migrants who 
are seeking to come here. I fully agree 
that it is in the best interests of the 
people of the United States and the 
people who seek to come here for us to 
have a simple, secure border. 
No one could logically disagree with 
that statement, by the way. But we 
don’t deal with logic. We deal with 
grand statements, and emotion, and al-
legations of kids in cages. But why 
don’t we have a debate? 
This Republican introduced legisla-
tion in the time of a Republican Presi-
dent that would pull power back from 
that Republican President because I 
believe it is in the best interests of this 
body, this Chamber, the House of Rep-
resentatives. Why don’t we do it? 
Do it now, I say to my Democratic 
colleagues. Don’t wait to do it when 
there is a Democrat in the White 
House. Let’s do it now. It is our job to 
make Article I great again. 
Why do we turn virtually all of our 
power over to courts and executives? 
We see it unfolding before our very 
eyes right now in the course of this 
pandemic. 
What are we doing with respect to 
the pandemic? What are we doing with 
respect to COVID? 
We launch a $2 trillion missile in 
April, and we walked away. Now we 
have executives around the country 
who are making all sorts of decisions 
irrespective of what their State legisla-
tures might be doing. We have a lot of 
power being executed in our Article II 
executive branch without any checks 
or balances here because we are not 
doing our job. 
Let’s have those debates. Let’s bring 
Scott Atlas, Fauci, Birx, a host of 
other doctors, let’s bring them before 
this body; not in some random com-
mittee with a handful of people on it 
on a Zoom call. Bring them before this 
body and let’s hear from them and let’s 
cross-examine them. And let’s under-
stand what is at stake. Let’s make 
good decisions based on that and let’s 
make sure the American people know 
the facts. 
I happen to be one of those people 
who believes that we should take this 
virus very seriously, who has a 77-year- 
old father who survived polio, and a 71- 
year-old mother that I want to protect 
from the virus. I also happen to be 
somebody who believes that we have 
scared the bejesus out of the American 
people in such a way that we are caus-
ing them harm. 
They 
are 
having 
mental 
health 
issues. They are not getting cancer 
screenings. Suicides are up, addictions 
are up, and we just bury our head in 
the sand and go around, and some peo-
ple on the other side of the aisle 
scream 200,000, and they think that is 
an argument when it is not an argu-
ment. It is an irresponsible effort to in-
still panic in the American people for 
political purposes. And that is pre-
cisely what my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle are doing. 
Why don’t we have a debate and have 
a discussion and bring people forward 
and determine the facts and share 
those facts with the American people 
so we can open our society up again 
properly, wisely, but open. 
I am always mystified while I watch 
people running around talking about 
how much we need to be locked down, 
but they are drinking their bottle of 
water. Sitting at a hearing today I saw 
Dr. Fauci drinking his bottle of water. 
I see people saying we need to stay 
locked down. They are drinking their 
Starbucks coffee. I see them stop off 
and pick up Little Taco in Austin, 
Texas, or go pick up some food. 
Who made it? Who distributed it? 
Who brought it to them on the curbside 
service? Who brought them their latte? 
Who is making their electricity run? 
Essential workers? Who among us are 
fine with endangering essential work-
ers in grocery stores and power compa-
nies and food service so that some peo-
ple can pat themselves on the back 
saying, They are doing a great thing by 
staying locked down? 
Let’s study the data, the reports that 
came out just today from Brown Uni-
versity showing a relatively low trans-
mission rate for some kids in college in 
our schools. Let’s study that data. 
Let’s look at how many are hospital-
ized. Let’s talk about how we are going 
to achieve immunity. It might be a 
vaccine. It might be that some of the 
most healthy members of society con-
tinue to engage and operate and we 
build up immunity. 
That is what we do for other things. 
Let’s talk about that, instead of scar-
ing the heck out of the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. Speaker, this is no way for us to 
do our job. Our job is to represent each 
and every American and to be here and 
debate and to vote. 
I am going to say one more time, 
with all due respect to the Speaker of 
the House, I cannot, for the life of me, 
understand why this body cannot meet 
and stand up for our law enforcement. 
I cannot understand why this body 
cannot meet, debate, and vote on a 
PPP extension bill, or another form of 
that kind of legislation to make sure 
our small businesses can survive; the 
restaurants, the music venues, the 
wineries, distilleries, breweries, barber 
shops, hotels—all of the entities that 
are struggling to survive right now 
throughout this country. 
Where are we? We have been back 
now after a long hiatus for 10 days-ish, 
not really. We will be back next week. 
What are we doing? Let’s pass that. 
Let’s stand up with law enforcement. 
Let’s pass a bill to protect our small 
businesses. 
Let’s do the basic duty that is incum-
bent upon us as Members of the United 
States House of Representatives to rep-
resent the people who are asking us to 
do those things. It is our job. We are 
asking millions of Americans to do 
their job while we completely and to-
tally fail to do ours. 
Mr. Speaker, we are $27 trillion in 
debt. It is about to jump to $30 trillion, 
and we walk around here like nothing 
is going on. Drugs and narcotics are 
still flowing across our southern bor-
der, and we don’t do a thing about it. 
Law enforcement is getting attacked 
on the streets—targeted—buildings are

Mr. Speaker, I will close by just say-
ing, it is an honor to serve in the 
United States House of Representa-
tives, but this body has got to do bet-

job. It is time for us to stand up for

S5795 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2020 
No. 165 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Gracious God, empower our law-
makers to grow in grace. Make them 
gentle yet brave, confident yet humble, 
wise yet dependent on Your guidance. 
Lord, give them the wisdom to cul-
tivate a faith that perseveres, keeping 
them from growing weary in doing 
what is right. Strengthen their ability 
to see among their colleagues Your di-
vine image. May our Senators increase 
in favor with You and humanity. Fill 
them with a passion to live for Your 
glory. 
We praise You for being our helper, 
and we desire to magnify Your Holy 
Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION 
SYSTEM 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
quite often in our newspapers, you can 
read about a lot of city and State pen-
sion funds that are in trouble. There is 
one at the national level we have to 
deal with, so today I speak about the 
multiemployer pension system prob-
lems and the need for reform. 
According to the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation’s annual projec-
tions—and those reports were released 
last week—there is a very big need for 
reform. That is as important as ever 
and getting more important every day. 
The report estimates that the Multi-
employer Insurance Program will be-
come insolvent in 2026. That is a year 
later than predicted last year, so peo-
ple might feel a little more comfort, 
but that is only because we gave relief 
last year to the mineworkers’ plan. 
What is worse is that insolvency will 
come at the same time that the Cen-
tral States Pension Fund will become 
insolvent, then creating an even bigger 
strain on the PBGC’s insurance fund. 
Reaching a bipartisan reform agree-
ment continues to be critically impor-
tant. I am very encouraged by recent 
indications from my Democratic col-
leagues that they are interested in 
working with us to find a solution—a 
solution that will strengthen this im-
portant part of our retirement system 
while ensuring that taxpayers aren’t 
left holding the bag again in the fu-
ture. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
2 days ago, the Democratic leader 
threatened that if the Senate majority 
dares to play by the rules and behave 
like a majority, it would mean ‘‘the 
end of this supposedly great delibera-
tive body’’—‘‘the end of this supposedly 
great deliberative body.’’ 
Yesterday, 
we 
learned 
what 
he 
meant. We saw important Senate busi-
ness hurt by what amounted to a tem-
per tantrum. For some reason, the 
Democratic leader decided to vent his 
frustration 
by 
blocking 
the 
Intel-
ligence Committee—listen to this— 
from holding a bipartisan counterintel-
ligence hearing—by blocking the Intel-
ligence Committee from holding a bi-
partisan counterintelligence hearing. 
The committee was set to hear from 
Bill Evanina, the Director of the Na-
tional Counterintelligence and Secu-
rity Center. This is the Nation’s top 
counterintelligence 
official. 
Among 
other things, he works directly on pro-
tecting our elections and our politics 
from foreign interference. That is his 
job. They were going to hear from him. 
This is the same Democratic leader 
who declared a few weeks ago that if 
the Intelligence Committee did not 
stay close to Congress on election secu-
rity, it would be ‘‘an abdication of 
[their] duty . . . to protect our democ-
racy.’’ Just last week, he wrote me a 
letter saying election security had to 
be ‘‘above partisan politics.’’ But now 
the Democratic leader’s temper is more 
important. He denied Chairman RUBIO 
routine permission for the bipartisan 
committee to meet. He said: ‘‘[W]e 
won’t have business as usual here in 
the Senate.’’ 
Today, both the Intelligence Com-
mittee and the Armed Services Com-
mittee are scheduled to meet. They are 
set to speak with top intelligence and 
military officials about election secu-
rity. I guess we will find out whether 
the Democratic leader’s embarrassing 
theatrics were just a 1-day matinee or 
whether he means to make this a se-
ries. 
Our bipartisan committees have a 
great deal of work to do to safeguard

September 23, 2020 
our Nation and, in particular, to pro-
tect our elections, so I hope our col-
league from New York gets out of the 
way. 
But the Democratic leader didn’t 
stop there. A few minutes later, he de-
cided to cheapen a solemn and unifying 
moment and turned a draft unanimous 
resolution honoring Justice Ginsburg 
into one more depressing stunt for the 
TV cameras. 
Over the weekend, I wrote a resolu-
tion honoring the late Justice’s amaz-
ing life. Normally, such measures are 
adopted with unanimous, bipartisan 
support. That is exactly what we did 
after Justice Scalia passed. Every Sen-
ator recognized that our collective eu-
logy was no place to debate political 
questions—oh, but not this time. This 
time, the Democratic leader copy- 
pasted the tribute I had written, put 
his name on top, and added two divi-
sive references to our debate over what 
to do next. He didn’t devote any time 
or attention to the language praising 
Justice Ginsburg’s life and career. He 
did not suggest a single change to any 
of that. His sole focus was on turning a 
solemn routine and unanimous mo-
ment for Justice Ginsburg into a plat-
form for himself. 
Justice Ginsburg could not be more 
deserving of the honor of a formal Sen-
ate tribute. I hope our colleague from 
New York will let us pass one some-
time soon. 
f 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, I have already 
talked a lot about history this week, 
but before we shift focus to President 
Trump’s nominee, we need to review 
Senate history one more time. 
As we await the hurricane of mis-
representations and bad-faith attacks 
that seem almost guaranteed to pour 
out, we need to understand, in very 
clear terms, why our colleague from 
New York is a uniquely non-credible 
messenger when it comes to the Sen-
ate’s role in judicial confirmations. 
It was Senate Democrats who began 
our 
modern 
challenges 
with 
their 
treatment of Robert Bork in 1987, but 
the acrimony really got going in the 
early 2000s when a group of Senate 
Democrats took the almost-never-used 
tactic of filibustering nominations and 
turned it into a constant routine for 
the first time ever. 
So who was the main driving force 
behind these tactics? Let’s consult 
some New York newspapers from the 
year 2003: 
Schumer decided [to] put ideology on the 
front burner in the confirmation process. 
. . . ‘‘I am the leader (of the filibuster move-
ment), and you know, I’m proud of it,’’ said 
the senator from Brooklyn. 
Mr. Schumer urged Democratic colleagues 
. . . to use a tactic that some were initially 
reluctant to pursue, and that has since roiled 
the Senate. 
Throughout President Bush 43’s two 
terms, our colleague built an entire 
personal brand out of filibustering judi-
cial nominees. Talented, hard-working 
people’s careers were destroyed, like 
the brilliant lawyer Miguel Estrada, a 
close 
friend 
of 
now-Justice 
Elena 
Kagan, who says he is ‘‘extraordinary’’ 
and ‘‘thoughtful’’ and would have made 
‘‘an excellent addition to any Federal 
court.’’ People like that, literally, were 
destroyed by Democratic tactics. 
This version of the now-Democratic 
leader said filibustering judges was an 
essential part—an essential part—of 
the Senate. He said that if Republicans 
ever 
used 
the 
nuclear 
option 
to 
‘‘change the rules in midstream’’ be-
cause ‘‘they can’t get their way on 
every judge . . . it’ll be a doomsday for 
democracy.’’ 
But of course, in the very next Presi-
dential administration, the Democratic 
leader leapt at the chance to press that 
doomsday button himself. Democrats 
could not abide by President Obama’s 
being constrained by the same rules 
they had imposed on President Bush. 
They had no patience to taste their 
own medicine. So the Democratic lead-
er suddenly decided that ‘‘the old rules 
need to be modified.’’ He voted to use 
the nuclear option to lower the bar. 
So there actually has been one con-
sistent principle all this time. For the 
Democratic leader, two things qualify 
as a crisis when it comes to the courts. 
The sky is falling when a Democratic 
President does not get to confirm every 
last judge he or she wants, and the sky 
is falling when a Republican President 
gets to confirm any judge. 
Six 
months 
ago, 
our 
colleague 
walked across the street to the Su-
preme Court steps, stood in front of a 
crowd, and yelled: 
I want to tell you, Gorsuch! I want to tell 
you, Kavanaugh! . . . You will pay the price! 
You won’t know what hit you if you go for-
ward with these awful decisions! 
That is the Democratic leader in 
front of the Supreme Court of the 
United States. 
Just last night he said this: 
I tell the American people, everything you 
need and want, just about everything, will be 
taken away inexorably, month after month, 
year after year, decision by decision, by this 
new court. 
That is the argument. That is, appar-
ently, the argument. ‘‘Everything you 
need and want will be taken away.’’ Is 
this a discussion among Senators or an 
overdramatic line from a bad movie? 
The American people do not need any 
more revisionist history lectures, any 
more threats, or any more performance 
outrage from the side that launched 
this unfortunate fight and escalated it 
time after time after time. 
There is one right path before us. It 
does right by the judiciary, the Senate, 
the yet-unnamed nominee, and the 
American people. It is a fair hearing, a 
fair process, and a fair vote. That is 
what the American people ensured in 
2018 after the Democratic leader explic-
itly asked for a referendum on this ap-
proach to the judiciary. He got that 
referendum in 2018. The people decided. 
They shrunk his minority even further. 
Americans took care to ensure Sen-
ate Democrats could not stand in the 
way of a fair process. So that is exactly 
what the Senate will provide. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on another matter, yesterday the 
House passed a government funding 
resolution on a bipartisan basis. It will 
now make its way through the Senate. 
A few days ago, when House Demo-
crats released their first draft, Repub-
licans immediately spoke out about a 
huge omission. It intentionally ne-
glected the needs of farm country and 
rural America. They tried to use our 
Nation’s farmers and ranchers as a bar-
gaining chip. 
Fortunately, thanks to the leader-
ship of our colleague Senator ERNST, 
along with Senators HOEVEN, BOOZMAN, 
and many other Republican colleagues, 
we made it clear right away that we 
would not let Democrats leave farmers 
behind. 
The Commodity Credit Corporation 
is an essential source of funding for our 
farmers. For years it has been rou-
tinely refilled with bipartisan support, 
but this year Speaker PELOSI tried to 
take Middle America hostage for unre-
lated political brinksmanship. 
I am grateful to Senator ERNST and 
everyone who fought hard to fix the 
Democrats’ bill. Republicans kept the 
Speaker of the House from adding in-
sult to injury in such a challenging 
year for rural America. 
I know all Members will carefully re-
view the continuing resolution sent 
over by the House. I am optimistic 
that, with bipartisan cooperation, we 
will be able to make law well before 
the government funding deadline at the 
end of this month. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 4653 AND H.R. 8337 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I understand there are two bills at the 
desk due a second reading en bloc. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the bills by title for the 
second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4653) to protect the healthcare of 
hundreds of millions of people of the United 
States and prevent efforts of the Department 
of Justice to advocate courts to strike down 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act. 
A bill (H.R. 8337) making continuing appro-
priations for fiscal year 2021, and for other 
purposes. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place 
the bills on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I would object to 
further proceedings, en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will be 
placed on the calendar. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved.

who were here until late last night and 
made such persuasive arguments as to 
why the new Supreme Court Justice 
matters so much to the American peo-
ple, to their healthcare, the working 
people’s rights, to women’s rights, to 
preserving the right to choose, to mak-
ing sure we have a good green planet, 
to LGBTQ rights. They did an eloquent 
job. 
I hope America was listening because 
this nomination matters; it matters to 
the average daily lives of average 
Americans. And last night, by holding 
the floor until the late hours, Demo-
crats made really strong arguments. 
I thank my colleagues for doing that. 
Madam President, for the third day 
in a row, Leader MCCONNELL has come 
to the floor and completely ignored the 
‘‘principle’’ he established in 2016, 
when, mere hours after Justice Scalia 
passed away, Leader MCCONNELL said 
that ‘‘the American people should have 
a voice in the selection of their next 
Supreme Court Justice’’—his words: 
‘‘The American people should have a 
voice in the selection of their next Su-
preme Court Justice,’’ referring to the 
upcoming election. 
That election was more than 8 
months away. We are now only 42 days 
away. But the so-called McConnell 
rule—the supposed principle that the 
American people deserve a voice in the 
selection of a Supreme Court Justice— 
hasn’t come up. The Republican leader 
can’t mention it. No wonder he never 
mentions it. And he sticks to just di-
versionary, irrelevant remarks in his 
speeches on the floor instead of ad-
dressing the main issue—why he said 
one thing in 2016 and a different thing 
now. 
Instead, the Senate is forced to suffer 
these tortured explanations and mis-
leading precedents. At a press con-
ference yesterday, here is how the Re-
publican leader described the Senate 
role in confirming the Supreme Court 
Justices. He actually said: ‘‘[W]e have 
an obligation under the Constitution 
[to consider a Supreme Court Justice] 
. . . should we choose to take advan-
tage of it.’’ 
Did you catch that? Did you catch 
that? It is an obligation, but only if the 
Republican leader chooses to take ad-
vantage of it. I see. So, when there is a 
Democratic President, it is one of 
those obligations you don’t have to 
take advantage of, but when there is a 
Republican President, it is a solemn 
constitutional duty. 
Are we really supposed to swallow 
the argument that, when the Senate 
and the President are of the opposite 
party, one rule applies, but when they 
are of the same party, a different rule 
applies? I didn’t hear that right after 
Scalia died when Leader MCCONNELL 
explained why he was holding it up. 
So this idea that when it is one 
party, one rule applies and another 
party, a different rule applies, we have 
a term for that. It is called a double 
standard. 
If the leader really wants to discuss 
precedent—real 
precedent, 
not 
fic-
tion—we can dispatch with that con-
versation in about 30 seconds. 
Madam President, I have a par-
liamentary inquiry for the Chair: Is 
there a Senate precedent for con-
firming a Supreme Court nominee be-
tween July and election day in a Presi-
dential year? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Mate-
rials from the offices of the Secretary 
of the Senate do not show such a prece-
dent. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam 
President. 
July is long gone. August is over. We 
are now at the end of September. As 
you just heard—not from the Demo-
cratic leader but from the records in 
the Senate, as spoken by the Chair, 
there is no, no, no precedent for con-
firming a Supreme Court Justice be-
tween July and election day. The Re-
publican leader can come up with argu-
ments that twist things, that jump 
through hoops, but it doesn’t gainsay 
no, no, no precedent for any Supreme 
Court nominee being confirmed be-
tween July and election day. As you 
know, July is gone. August is over. We 
are now at the end of September. It is 
6 weeks before an election in which 
some people have already begun to 
vote. 
Simply, my Republican friends have 
no ground on which to stand—none. 
There is no logic to excuse flipping 
their position 4 years apart, under the 
same circumstances. There is no jus-
tification for the Senators who said on 
the record that they would ‘‘say the 
same thing if a Republican president 
were in office’’—‘‘say the same thing if 
a Republican president were in office’’ 
they said then, but it doesn’t apply 
now that we have a Republican Presi-
dent in office. There is no defense for 
the Senator who said: ‘‘Precedent set. 
Precedent set. I’m sure come 2020, 
you’ll remind me of that.’’ There is no 
place to hide for the Senator who said: 
‘‘You can say that I said, let the next 
president decide. Hold this tape. I want 
you to use my words against me.’’ 
Why are Senate Republicans going to 
such extreme lengths to ram through a 
Justice weeks before an election, mak-
ing a complete mockery of their pre-
vious ‘‘principle’’? Why are they com-
mitting a power grab so egregious that 
it risks shredding the last vestiges of 
trust that remain between our two par-
ties? For what? Because this is the 
only way for Republicans to achieve 
their radical, rightwing agenda—an 
agenda so far away from where average 
Americans think, even average Repub-
licans, that they wouldn’t dare bring 
such things on the floor of the Senate. 
Unable to thrust comically unpopu-
lar positions on the American people 
through Congress, they have to try 
through the courts—a cynical strategy 
that dates back to the 1950s. 
Republicans are sick and tired, for 
instance, of this annoying law, the Af-
fordable Care Act, and that it keeps 
providing healthcare to millions of 
Americans. They tried to repeal it in 
the House just about a million times, 
and they tried here, too, in the Senate 
but failed by one vote. So now they 
have taken it to the courts. 
President Trump and Republican at-
torneys general are suing right now to 
eliminate the entire law, including pro-
tections for up to 130 million Ameri-
cans with preexisting conditions. In 
fact, President Trump is meeting with 
those Republican attorneys general at 
the White House today, this afternoon. 
Less than a week after Justice Gins-
burg’s passing, the President is meet-
ing with the leaders of the Republican 
lawsuit against our healthcare law. Os-
tensibly, it is about how social media 
companies are biased against conserv-
atives, but who wants to bet that the 
healthcare lawsuit doesn’t come up? I 
would like for someone to ask them 
that. 
If he cared about healthcare and the 
American 
people, 
President 
Trump 
himself would ask the AGs to withdraw 
their lawsuit. I am calling on him to do 
it right now. I doubt he will, given his 
record, given his lack of concern for 
the American people’s healthcare, but 
he should. But, unfortunately, let’s re-
member, President Trump already told 
the American people his goal. He said: 
‘‘My judicial appointments will do the 
right thing, unlike Bush’s appointee 
John Roberts, on ObamaCare.’’ 
He is about to make a Supreme Court 
pick while there is an ongoing lawsuit 
that seeks to eliminate the Affordable 
Care Act. Hear that, America? The 
healthcare 
law 
you 
want, 
the 
healthcare 
law 
you 
need, 
the 
healthcare 
law 
that 
protects 
you 
against overreaching insurance compa-
nies that will not give you insurance 
when you have a preexisting condi-
tion—President Trump has said he will 
appoint a nominee who will undo it, 
and we know he said it because of what 
he said about Justice Roberts when 
Justice Roberts opposed his view on 
healthcare. 
Guess when the case is being heard in 
the Supreme Court, America. Novem-
ber 10, a week after the election. Is 
that why Senate Republicans are in 
such a rush to get a new rightwing Jus-
tice confirmed before the election—so 
that the Supreme Court can do what 
they failed to do here in the Senate— 
repeal this healthcare law, which pro-
tects so many Americans? 
Leader MCCONNELL slammed on the 
brakes while tens of thousands of 
Americans died from COVID, and now 
he is slamming his foot on the gas to 
approve a Supreme Court Justice who 
could rip away Americans’ healthcare 
in the middle of a pandemic. Shame. 
Shame.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5798 
September 23, 2020 
For 4 months, the Republican major-
ity delayed a COVID-relief package 
while the Nation suffered, but 1 hour— 
1 hour—after the news of Justice Gins-
burg’s passing broke, Leader MCCON-
NELL said ‘‘batten down hatches, we’re 
full steam ahead’’ on confirming an-
other rightwing Justice—a Justice who 
could undo Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s leg-
acy; who could rip away healthcare 
from millions of American families; 
who could decide there is no more right 
to choose for millions of American 
women—Roe v. Wade hangs in the bal-
ance here; who could crush unions for 
millions of American workers; who 
could make it harder to vote for mil-
lions of African Americans; who could 
end marriage equality for millions of 
LGBTQ Americans, like my daughter 
and her wife, who looked at each other 
this weekend and wondered, is our mar-
riage on the line? 
Average 
Americans 
are 
thinking, 
what are they going to lose with this 
new, hard-right, special interest-domi-
nated Supreme Court if—if—our Repub-
lican friends have their wish, which we 
are going to fight every step of the 
way? The stakes of this election, the 
stakes of this vacancy concern no less 
than the future fundamental rights of 
the American people. 
My friends on the other side will tell 
you that we are being hysterical, that 
they actually support protections for 
Americans with preexisting conditions. 
That is hysterical? Ask the mother 
whose son or daughter has cancer and 
can’t get insurance and watches their 
child 
suffer. 
That 
is 
not 
being 
hysterical; that is doing what we are 
supposed to do, not what the folks on 
the 
other 
side 
are 
doing—rushing 
through a Justice who, in a very strong 
likelihood if that Justice gets ap-
proved, would rip healthcare away 
from the American people. 
America, you have to ask yourselves, 
if Republicans will completely reverse 
themselves on a major principle when-
ever it suits them, what can you trust 
them on? How can you take their word 
seriously? 
Republicans have praised the legacy 
of Justice Ginsburg with flowery words 
about her impact, but in the resolution 
I offered yesterday, they even didn’t 
want to acknowledge her dying wish 
that she not be replaced until the next 
President is installed. 
President Trump had the gall, the te-
merity, the baseness to suggest her 
dying words were not issued by her. 
How low can the President go? 
Senate Republicans are working with 
every fiber of their being to confirm a 
Justice—despite her last wish, in con-
tradiction to her dying, most fervent 
wish—who will reverse her legacy. This 
is not speculation. This is not hyper-
bole. President Trump has said again 
and again and again that he wants the 
Supreme Court to ‘‘terminate’’ the 
healthcare law. He made it clear he has 
a litmus test: Any Trump nominee 
must want to strike down Roe v. Wade. 
For once, Republicans should be 
straight with the American people. 
They are fighting to reverse Justice 
Ginsburg’s legacy, not honor it. All of 
their speeches of praise run totally hol-
low and are belied by their actions. 
America, you can’t trust them at 
their word. You can’t trust them to 
protect your healthcare, and you defi-
nitely can’t trust this Senate Repub-
lican majority to protect you.

JOHNSON REPORT 
Mr. SCHUMER. While the rest of the 
country was busy fighting COVID, Sen-
ate Republicans have been abusing the 
power of the Senate to conduct opposi-
tion research for President Trump’s 
campaign. 
This morning, the chairman of the 
Homeland 
Security 
Committee 
re-
leased his report, which reads as if 
Putin wrote it, not U.S. Senators. The 
bogus narrative of this report, peddled 
by a Russian disinformation campaign, 
was disproved by every witness who 
testified. Despite their zeal to smear 
Vice President Biden and his family, 
Senate 
Republicans 
found 
no 
evi-
dence—no evidence—to support the 
conspiracy theories pushed by Putin’s 
intelligence agencies. 
Senators 
GRASSLEY
and 
JOHNSON 
should reimburse taxpayers for the 
money they wasted. This entire dis-
graceful affair and the Johnson report 
should be relegated to the dustbin of 
history. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I 
don’t think anyone is surprised that 
Democrats have not reacted well to the 
idea that President Trump will nomi-
nate a third Supreme Court Justice. 
After all, overreacting to Republican 
nominees is pretty much the Demo-
crats’ stock-in-trade. It doesn’t matter 
who the nominee is. To hear the Demo-
crats tell it, any Republican nominee is 
likely to bring about Armageddon. 
The fact that some Republican nomi-
nees in past years, and as recently as 
this past June, have sided with the lib-
eral wing of the Court more often than 
I would like has not in any way re-
strained Democrats’ hysteria each time 
a new Republican nominee is intro-
duced. 
I thought we had reached a low point 
2 years ago with the nomination of 
Justice 
Kavanaugh, 
who 
suffered 
months of character assassination at 
the hands of Democrats, but it turns 
out that was not the low point because 
we have reached a new low. 
As I said, it is no surprise the Demo-
crats have reacted with hysteria at the 
prospect of President Trump nomi-
nating another Supreme Court Justice. 
It was disappointing—but hardly sur-
prising—that 
yesterday 
the 
Demo-
cratic leader blocked a key Intel-
ligence Committee hearing on election 
security, a topic he has repeatedly in-
sisted is of overwhelming importance, 
to protest the thought of the Senate 
fulfilling its advice and consent role 
and confirming a principled, conserv-
ative woman. Even Speaker PELOSI’s 
overwrought statement that Repub-
licans are ‘‘coming after your chil-
dren,’’ seemed pretty much par for the 
course. 
Democrats have not limited them-
selves to temper tantrums. No, Demo-
crats have moved on to threats. Dare 
to confirm the President’s duly nomi-
nated nominee, Democrats are now 
saying, and if we win back the major-
ity in November, we will eliminate the 
legislative filibuster and pack the Su-
preme Court. 
In other words, if Republicans dare to 
fulfill the Senate’s role of advising and 
consenting to the President’s nominee, 
Democrats will upend our democratic 
institutions. They will eliminate the 
legislative filibuster, which is the Sen-
ate rule that helps ensure legislation 
that passes the Senate has to be at 
least somewhat bipartisan. 
And they will pack the Supreme 
Court. For those who need a brief re-
fresher on the concept of court pack-
ing, which had been largely consigned 
to the dustbin of history nearly a cen-
tury ago, the theory is as follows: If 
the Supreme Court is not deciding 
cases to your liking, add more Justices 
to the Court until you start getting the 
decisions that you want. In other 
words, let Republicans dare to fill the 
vacant slot on the Supreme Court, and 
Democrats will keep adding Justices to 
the Court until they can be assured 
they will get the outcome they want in 
every case. 
Yesterday, I referred to those Demo-
crats as undemocratic. Why did I say 
that? They are inconsistent with demo-
cratic government. In our system of

September 23, 2020 
government, you win some and you 
lose some. While it is no fun when you 
lose, that is how things sometimes go 
in a democracy. Have Republicans been 
enthusiastic 
when 
Democrat 
Presi-
dents have had nominees confirmed to 
the Supreme Court? No, but have Re-
publicans suggested that Democrat Su-
preme Court Justices are illegitimate? 
Have we suggested that the proper re-
sponse to a Democrat Supreme Court 
nominee is to pack the Supreme Court 
with additional Republican Justices to 
get a rubberstamp for Republican pri-
orities? No, of course not. 
While we may not like it when Demo-
crats are in charge, we know that Dem-
ocrat-run government is legitimate, 
just as Republican-run government is 
legitimate. It has become clear over 
the past few years—especially over the 
past few days—that Democrats think 
government is legitimate only when 
they are in charge. So Democrats are 
accusing Republicans of undermining 
our institutions by fulfilling our con-
stitutional role because that is exactly 
what we are doing: fulfilling our con-
stitutional role. 
Let’s be very clear about that. Re-
publicans are suggesting that we take 
up a Supreme Court nominee duly 
nominated by a duly elected President 
and confirm that nominee in accord 
with our constitutional advice and con-
sent role. 
Democrats are free to think that Re-
publicans should not consider this 
nominee, but it is absolutely indis-
putable 
that 
Republicans 
and 
the 
President are doing nothing more than 
carrying out a legitimate constitu-
tional prerogative. 
What Democrats are doing, on the 
other hand, is trying to ensure that 
only one party has a say in our govern-
ment—what some might call tyranny— 
and threatening retribution for the ex-
ercise of legitimate constitutional pre-
rogatives. That does pose a danger to 
our institutions. 
Take the Supreme Court. A year ago, 
several Democrats warned that the 
Court’s nonpartisan reputation was in 
jeopardy. Their argument was that the 
Court would look partisan if it did con-
tinue with a case the Democrats didn’t 
like. What on Earth do Democrats 
think will happen to the Court’s rep-
utation if they pack the Court with ad-
ditional Democrats to rubberstamp 
their policies? Do they really think 
Americans are going to see the Su-
preme Court as legitimate once it has 
been hijacked for partisan Democratic 
purposes? 
If you believe in our system of gov-
ernment, you have to believe that all 
Americans—not just those who agree 
with you—have a right to have a voice 
in the government. You are free to ve-
hemently disagree with 50 percent of 
your fellow Americans. You are free to 
dislike it when your party is not in 
charge. You are free to fight fiercely 
for the policies and candidates you be-
lieve in. But what you cannot do with-
out undermining our entire system is 
suggest that government is legitimate 
only when your party is in charge. 
If Democrats continue along this 
dangerous trajectory, if they continue 
to try to delegitimize the actions of a 
duly elected Senate majority and a 
duly elected President, they are the 
ones who will put our entire system at 
risk. 
If anyone wonders for a moment 
whether Democrats are advocating a 
principled position—if perhaps Demo-
crats really think it would be best for 
our country to eliminate the legisla-
tive filibuster Democrats have used so 
often 
or 
to 
expand 
the 
Supreme 
Court—one can simply ask whether 
Democrats will continue to advocate 
for these positions if President Trump 
is reelected and Republicans retain 
control of the Senate. Think about 
that one. I think everyone here knows 
what the answer to that question is, 
and the answer is no. 
As I suggested, Democrats’ threats 
are not going to stop Republicans from 
carrying out our constitutional role in 
considering the President’s nominee. 
One of the principle reasons that many 
GOP Senators, myself included, ran for 
office in the first place was to confirm 
principled judges to our courts—judges 
who understand that their role is to in-
terpret the law, not make the law. 
While many of my Democrat col-
leagues would like the courts to impose 
their policies when they can’t push 
them through Congress, Republicans 
know that legislation should come 
from Congress and not from the courts. 
The job of judges is to interpret the 
law as it is written, not to oppose Dem-
ocrat or Republican policies from the 
bench. 
My colleagues and I were elected and 
reelected, in part, because of our com-
mitment to confirming judges who 
would uphold the Constitution and the 
rule of law. We have followed through 
on that commitment over the past 4 
years, and we are going to keep fol-
lowing through by voting on the Presi-
dent’s nominee. 
Democrats can bluster. They can 
threaten. They can throw temper tan-
trums. But we will keep doing what we 
were sent here to do. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
AGRICULTURE 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, we are 
here to talk about agriculture. We are 
here to talk about those great farmers 
and ranchers who feed this country and 
feed the world. 
You know, when we talk about good 
farm policy, we are talking about 
something that benefits every single 
American every single day because our 
farmers and ranchers produce the high-
est quality, lowest cost food supply in 
the history of the world that benefits 
every single American every single 
day. That is just how important it is. 
How could we be reminded even more 
so right now than during this COVID 
pandemic of that abundant, safe, won-
derful food supply that we have every 
day thanks to our farmers and ranch-
ers, and there is so much that goes into 
it. 
As the Presiding Officer well knows, 
with Nebraska as his State and its 
being a big part of the incredible ag 
production in this country—as a mat-
ter of fact, there could be a little ri-
valry here with his contiguous State to 
the north in terms of cattle production 
or something like that—this is some-
thing that touches everybody every 
day and is so important. 
It is not just those farmers and 
ranchers who produce that food every 
day; it is the whole supply chain that 
has to work. Remember, that food sup-
ply has to be safe every day, not only 
tasty and affordable and abundant, and 
that is what we are talking about. This 
has become a big, big issue in the con-
tinuing resolution that we are working 
on right now in that the way we are 
funding the coronavirus food assistance 
programs, in part, is with the direct 
funding that we secured in the CARES 
Act and also from what they call the 
CCC, the Commodity Credit Corpora-
tion. With regard to the farm bill—the 
bipartisan farm bill that has incredibly 
strong support on both sides of the 
aisle in this body and the House—many 
of its very key programs are funded by 
the Commodity Credit Corporation. We 
put about $30 billion a year into that 
fund every year to make sure that 
those programs are funded to support 
our farmers and ranchers. 
That was not in the original House 
version that was going to be filed, so a 
group of Senators from ag States came 
together last week and had a colloquy 
in this body. They immediately went 
to work with our friends in the House 
who are also strong supporters of agri-
culture and now the continuing resolu-
tion that has passed the House over-
whelmingly, which we will be taking 
up, has that key funding in it. 
So we are really here to, once again, 
emphasize the importance of making 
sure we fund these farm programs, to 
make sure that we fund them in a 
timely way, and, again, to point out 
very clearly that this is funding that is 
being used expressly the way it was au-
thorized to be used both in the over-
whelmingly bipartisan farm bill we 
passed—the 5-year farm bill—but also 
in the CARES Act, in which we secured 
additional funding. Now the funding 
that is included in the continuing reso-
lution is exactly that funding that we 
put out there every year to make sure 
this farm bill is provided on time. 
It could not be more important than 
this year, when not only are our farm-
ers and ranchers fighting COVID but

September 23, 2020 
when they are fighting low commodity 
prices, challenges in the world of trade 
in their being targeted by China, fight-
ing challenges of tough weather, and 
on top of that, COVID. So, again, we 
have to be there for them. 
I thank the Members of the Senate 
and the House who worked very hard 
on this and the farm group, and I am 
going to kind of run through this whole 
roster here in a minute. 
Before I do that, I turn to the senior 
Senator from South Dakota—our whip 
here in the Senate and somebody who 
has worked on behalf of agriculture his 
whole life—and ask him for a few of his 
comments. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I say to 
my colleague from North Dakota how 
much we appreciate his leadership. He 
is a relentless advocate for the farmers 
and ranchers of North Dakota and 
across this country. We share a border, 
but we also have a lot of commonality 
in the people whom we represent. They 
are hard-working people who work 
from dawn to dusk to feed not only this 
country but the world. 
It has been no easy task being in ag-
riculture during these last few years 
for lots of reasons, as my colleague 
from North Dakota has pointed out, 
whether it be from, of course, most re-
cently, COVID, but also from chron-
ically low and depressed commodity 
prices, coupled with bad weather, cou-
pled with trade disputes, and difficul-
ties with markets here and around the 
world. Farmers and ranchers have had 
a tough and difficult road these past 
few years, so it is critically important 
that we continue to be there for them. 
As my colleague from North Dakota 
pointed out, there was a concern be-
cause what we had heard initially 
would be in the continuing resolution 
that was coming over from the House— 
that will fund the government and that 
we will pass, hopefully, later this week 
in the Senate—was not going to in-
clude funding for agriculture and for 
all of those programs that keep ag run-
ning that we authorized in the farm 
bill. 
A key Member of the House Agri-
culture Committee, Senator BOOZMAN, 
of Arkansas, who is also a key member 
of that committee—in fact, he is some-
body we hope to be the next chairman 
of that committee—and the current 
chairman of our authorizing com-
mittee, Senator ROBERTS, of Kansas, 
who, I think, will be down here in just 
a few minutes, all played an important 
role, along with the ag community. All 
of 
the 
organizations 
that 
Senator 
HOEVEN is going to talk about engaged 
right away when they realized what 
was happening, and we were able to 
work together to solve that. 
Now we will consider on the floor of 
the Senate the continuing resolution 
to fund the government that does in-
clude funding for the Commodity Cred-
it Corporation, which provides the 
funds that keep all of those agricul-
tural programs that we authorize when 
we do a farm bill. The last farm bill 
was in 2018, and we were all involved 
with that. It would keep all of those 
programs funded, and that is critically 
important. It has never been more im-
portant than it is right now in our 
coming out of the pandemic. Food se-
curity is an absolutely essential pri-
ority. It should be for our country, and 
it certainly should be for the Members 
of Congress in both the House and the 
Senate. 
I 
thank 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
HOEVEN. As I said, he is a strong, 
strong voice for our agricultural pro-
ducers. When he and I and those from 
Arkansas and Kansas and Nebraska— 
those of us from farm country—work 
together and put together coalitions at 
times like this, it is only due to that 
advocacy we have heard from Senator 
HOEVEN and others that has enabled us 
to be successful. 
I am glad that we have gotten the 
right outcome here, and it is some-
thing to celebrate. Obviously, our 
farmers and ranchers across the coun-
try are going to be, I think, enor-
mously grateful that we have been able 
to get this problem resolved. 
I thank the Senator for his leader-
ship, and I look forward to continuing 
to work with my colleagues on those 
issues that are important in farm coun-
try that will help our farmers and 
ranchers not only survive but, hope-
fully, prosper into the future. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senate’s 
majority whip for all of the work he 
has done. 
Again, he works for farmers day in 
and day out. He comes from South Da-
kota, which is a strong farming and big 
ranching State. He was instrumental in 
this effort, not only by his joining us 
last week in the colloquy but then by 
engaging in the negotiations as part of 
our leadership time, along with our 
majority leader, who held fast on this. 
I have to tell you that, as we nego-
tiated back and forth with the House, 
our leadership—Senator MCCONNELL, 
Senator 
THUNE, 
and 
others—held 
strong in saying: No, this is something 
that must be in the continuing resolu-
tion. Also, the administration—the 
President and the White House—was 
involved in this negotiation and held 
fast on this as well. 
This is one of the last pieces of the 
puzzle to come into place, but it is so 
very important that we have gotten it. 
As I say, we had seven Senators down 
on the floor last week who were talk-
ing about it, and those seven Senators 
were led by our Ag chairman, and I will 
I ask him to make a few comments as 
well. 
Again, let me thank those other Sen-
ators who have joined and will join 
us—Senator THUNE, from whom you 
just heard; Senator BOOZMAN, from 
whom you will hear in just a minute; 
Senator ERNST, of Iowa; Senator FISCH-
ER, of Nebraska; and Senator HYDE- 
SMITH, of Mississippi. All have strong 
ag backgrounds. I mean, they are peo-
ple who not only work on behalf of ag-
riculture but who are involved in agri-
culture. They are not just here, advo-
cating for it—they live it. It is a great 
group. 
They have also reached out to so 
many in the House, to the farm groups, 
to the commodity groups, and to the ag 
groups, which I will talk a little bit 
more about later. 
Let me turn to our Ag chairman, 
who, though still a relatively young 
man, has been in the House and the 
Senate for many years and has always 
been a tireless advocate for agri-
culture. He is a marine—once a marine 
always a marine. Semper Fi. He brings 
that attitude—that marine, you know, 
‘‘never turn back and never let up’’ at-
titude—and makes sure that he does 
everything he can on behalf of our 
farmers and ranchers. 
I yield to the chairman. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distin-
guished Senator for his comments. I 
appreciate the shout-out for the U.S. 
Marine Corps and to all of us who are 
marines. 
The Marine Corps taught me one 
thing, and that was that I could always 
do more than I thought I could. This is 
a good example of what happens when 
we work together as a team—when we 
work with our colleagues across the 
aisle—when we see a real problem that 
has come up. 
This was a situation for which I 
wanted to express my gratitude to all 
of the Members who joined together to 
provide certainty and predictability. 
This is what we sold the farm bill on— 
certainty and predictability. We had a 
situation that we faced, and it was 
really difficult to understand how this 
came about, but that is not the news 
today. The news today is good news in 
that we reached a compromise and 
found agreement to replenish the CCC, 
the Commodity Credit Corporation, in 
the continuing resolution, absent some 
of the barbed wire that was in there. 
I especially want to thank more than 
40 agriculture organizations, and I have 
the letter right here. I know both Sen-
ators who are in attendance here, as 
well as Senator THUNE and everybody 
concerned, are aware of it. It is to Ma-
jority 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, 
Speaker 
PELOSI, Leader SCHUMER, and Leader 
MCCARTHY. It is from 47 different farm 
organizations and commodity groups 
that speak for, I think, virtually every 
farmer, rancher, and grower in the 
country. So I give thanks to the 47. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed at this point in the RECORD this 
letter, dated September 15, 2020, from 
47 farm organizations and commodity 
groups. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5801 
September 23, 2020 
SEPTEMBER 15, 2020. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
MAJORITY
LEADER
MCCONNELL, 
SPEAKER
PELOSI, 
LEADER
SCHUMER
AND 
LEADER MCCARTHY: As Congress assembles a 
continuing resolution to extend government 
funding, we respectfully ask that you pro-
vide the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) with the resources necessary to con-
tinue assisting American farmers and ranch-
ers. To that end, reimbursement for the 
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) must 
be included in any measure to keep govern-
ment operating past the current fiscal year. 
For decades, CCC has been regularly re-
plenished to fund programs integral to the 
farm safety net that Congress has worked 
tirelessly to craft. Producers count on pro-
grams like Agriculture Risk Coverage, Price 
Loss Coverage, Dairy Margin Coverage, Mar-
keting Assistance Loans, conservation pro-
grams, and many others as they provide 
food, fuel and fiber for our nation. Without 
immediate CCC reimbursement, payments 
and programs would be significantly delayed, 
jeopardizing operations across the country. 
More than ever, farmers and ranchers need 
the certainty and support provided by farm 
programs. Low commodity prices, unjusti-
fied retaliatory tariffs, natural disasters, and 
a global pandemic have placed a tremendous 
burden on farm country. USDA’s most recent 
farm income projections forecast that cash 
receipts will be at their lowest level in more 
than a decade. Coupled with rising farm debt 
and a decrease in working capital, producers 
face challenges not experienced in decades. 
As the industry continues to endure hard-
ships during this unprecedented time, we 
urge you to include CCC reimbursement in a 
continuing resolution. Thank you for your 
consideration and continued efforts on behalf 
of American agriculture. 
Sincerely, 
Agricultural Retailers Association, Amcot,

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, if we 
had not done this, it would have re-
sulted in delays in the 2018 farm bill 
programs—the one that we passed here 
with 87 votes—and the ability farmers 
would have with the risk management 
tools. 
I would just simply point out that no 
matter what they grow or where they 
live, farmers, ranchers, and growers 
have done their part to ensure that our 
Nation’s food, fiber, and fuel supplies 
continue without disruption during 
these unprecedented times. They are 
counting on the Department of Agri-
culture—and, for that matter, the Con-
gress—to deliver a range of agriculture, 
nutrition, conservation, and forestry 
programs. 
More than 50 of these programs—here 
is the list—were in danger because of 
the uncertainty in replenishing the 
CCC funding and then due to some of 
the add-ons with regard to policy being 
difficult to understand. Well, they are 
easy to understand, but it is bad pol-
icy, bad precedent. 
We have put the Secretary of Agri-
culture in a very bad position in that 
he has announced the specifics of this 
program. I would urge all of my col-
leagues—more 
especially 
my 
col-
leagues across the aisle who have ex-
pressed great concern as to what is in 
this latest program and what isn’t—to 
get on the phone, and I will get on the 
phone with the Secretary. I know that 
Senator BOOZMAN and Senator HOEVEN 
will do the same. We all have concerns 
as to how this is going to work, and 
that has been true with all of the pro-
grams prior to this one. That is the 
way to express our concern with regard 
to getting something done. 
I do want to point out that my col-
leagues across the aisle, under the ban-
ner of nutrition programs—the SNAP 
program in particular, school lunches, 
et cetera—did point out that we had 
some real deficiencies with regard to 
keeping our commitment to these pro-
grams, more especially with COVID–19. 
I understand that, so that was in-
cluded. That is really what we are all 
about here—working in a bipartisan 
fashion on behalf of farmers, ranchers, 
and growers in agriculture. That is 
what we have always done on the com-
mittee. 
I thank my distinguished ranking 
member, and I thank everybody who 
brought this thing together. 
As the chairman of this committee, 
we were successful. As I indicated, in a 
bipartisan manner, we—87 Members of 
this Chamber—voted in favor of this 
legislation. These were some of the 
programs that were threatened: price 
loss coverage, agriculture risk cov-
erage, and marketing assistance loans. 
If you just go down the list of every-
thing farmers were depending on, all of 
a sudden, it was up in the air. Why that 
was true I am not quite sure, but this 
shows the extent of the damage that 
could have been done with the original 
request in the CR without the CCC 
funding. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed at this point in the RECORD a 
list of these programs that were in dan-
ger. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Price Loss Coverage; Agriculture Risk Cov-
erage–County; Agriculture Risk Coverage–In-
dividual; Marketing Assistance Loans; Eco-

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, find-
ing a bipartisan solution to replenish 
the CCC and to provide much needed 
certainty and predictability for all rea-
sons, all crops, all farmers, and all 
ranchers, I, again, appreciate the ef-
forts of my colleagues and those who 
represent them—the Nation’s farmers, 
ranchers, growers, rural stakeholders, 
everybody in rural and small-town 
America, and their lenders, who could 
not believe what we were about to face 
with pulling out the CCC funds with re-
gards to the CR, or the continuing res-
olution, to keep our government run-
ning and avoid a government shut-
down. 
So this agreement, the continuing 
resolution, represents a good step, a 
good bipartisan step. I really appre-
ciate that, although I must say we 
didn’t have to go down this road.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5802 
September 23, 2020 
There is a saying we have in Kansas 
that there are a lot cactus in the 
world. We don’t have to sit on every 
doggone one of them. And, boy, we sat 
on this one, and we sat on it too long. 
I want thank the staff, especially the 
Agriculture 
Committee 
staff, 
rep-
resenting all of our Members on the Ag 
Committee. 
They 
did 
tremendous 
work, making sure the right policy was 
there, making sure that at least the 
CCC was operating with the funds that 
they need to operate during the middle 
of COVID–19, and, again, on behalf of 
all of agriculture. 
So I want to again thank Senator 
HOEVEN for holding this discussion. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HOEVEN). The Senator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, before 
Chairman ROBERTS leaves, I just want-
ed to come down and lend my voice to 
him and Senators BOOZMAN, THUNE, 
and HOEVEN, and to Chairman ROBERTS 
and his staff for his work, and the Pre-
siding Officer. Thank you for spelling 
me in the Chair momentarily. Senator 
HOEVEN and his team have done great 
work as well. 
As Chairman ROBERTS
just said, 
there was no reason to have gone down 
this path and injected all of this par-
tisan uncertainty, holding farmers and 
ranchers and their communities and 
their lenders and their welders and 
their truckers hostage over the last 48 
hours. It served no policy purpose, and 
it continues to diminish public trust in 
this institution and our ability to serve 
our people. 
So I just want to commend you and 
Senator HOEVEN and your teams for the 
work that you have done. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, we are 
here today to commend our Republican 
leadership for forging a bipartisan 
compromise on a continuing resolution 
to avoid a government shutdown. 
In particular, I am so pleased that we 
reached an agreement that included 
full reimbursement to the Commodity 
Credit Corporation, which we have all 
been talking about—not only agree-
ment, but to take away the potential 
of unnecessary delays in farm and con-
servation payments, which are so im-
portant to our farmers. 
For decades, the CCC has been rou-
tinely reimbursed without fanfare, but, 
unfortunately, not so this year. Our 
farmers and ranchers have faced more 
than enough challenges this year—ex-
treme weather events, low commodity 
prices, market volatility, a global pan-
demic, and the list just goes on and on 
and on. They don’t need Washington to 
make things even more difficult. 
With passage of this bill, with the 
full CCC reimbursement, farm and con-
servation program payments will go 
out as planned and will offer farmers 
and ranchers a little more certainty 
and a little bit more predictability to 
continue growing the food and fiber for 
this Nation—not only for this Nation 
but for the world. 
These important programs—like Ag 
Risk Coverage, Price Loss Coverage, 
Market Assistance Loans, the Environ-
mental Quality Incentive Program, and 
others—were authorized in the 2018 
farm bill that was supported with an 
overwhelmingly 
bipartisan 
record 
number of votes in the Senate. 
So I want to really just thank all of 
those involved in this effort. They 
worked so, so very hard. A special 
thanks to Senator MCCONNELL and his 
staff and Chairman ROBERTS, whom we 
have with us now, who is certainly the 
voice of ag in the Senate and in Con-
gress. We are going to miss him great-
ly, as he decides to step aside. And also 
to Senator HOEVEN and the great work 
that he did through the ag appropria-
tions part of this. 
Then, as Senator ROBERTS
men-
tioned, there are the staffs that worked 
so, so very hard, and also the members 
of the Ag Committee who stepped up 
and really shouldered the burden and 
just did a tremendous job in really ex-
plaining to Congress and explaining to 
the public how important this issue 
was and that we simply could not go 
forward without getting it included. 
Then we are here, and we fight. We 
are kind of the tip of the stick and the 
spear in the ag community and worked 
really hard in that regard. We simply 
couldn’t get it done without the agri-
culture groups that worked so, so very 
hard, again, in educating the farmers. 
They understand how important this 
is, but, again, mobilizing them, mobi-
lizing the public so that we could have 
the great result that we did. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank the Senator from Arkan-
sas again for his diligence and hard 
work, and our Ag chairman. 
I just want to wrap up with some 
thank-yous, as well, and it starts with 
our Ag chairman, not only for his lead-
ership on the farm bill but then on 
making sure we fund these farm pro-
grams. 
I tell you, it has been something that 
I know Senator BOOZMAN agrees with 
me on. We have learned a lot from him, 
and we appreciate it. It has made a real 
difference for farmers and ranchers 
across this country. 
I want to thank, of course, all of the 
Senators that worked with us on this 
project—I named them earlier—but our 
House Members too. We reached out to 
Members of the House, whether it was 
the ranking member on the Ag Com-
mittee, Representative CONAWAY, or 
whether it was Representative FORTEN-
BERRY. There are many others that 
reached out and helped as well. 
I agree. I want to thank our staff, led 
by Tony Eberhard, my chief, and on 
the Agriculture side, by Morgan Ulmer 
and her whole crew, Shannon Hines, 
and, of course, RICHARD SHELBY, our 
leader on the Approps side, and some-
body whom you worked with for many, 
many years, Mr. Chairman. 
It takes all of these people working 
together. This was really important, 
not just for the farm bill but for that 
disaster assistance, the coronavirus 
food assistance funding that we are 
providing, as well, which our farmers 
and ranchers need so very much as we 
go through this COVID fight. 
So let me just wrap up. This is some-
thing that the Ag chairman brought 
up. I thought, as usual, right on. He 
said we wouldn’t have been able to get 
this done without the farm groups and 
the ranch groups stepping up and call-
ing their Member, whether it was their 
Senator or their House Member. 
Our chairman also already intro-
duced this into the RECORD—the let-
ter—which was so important. But I am 
going to take just a minute and read 
through those ag groups, if I could, as 
our way of finishing up with a thank 
you. 
I am just going to read through those 
47 groups: Agriculture Retailers Asso-
ciation, 
Amcot, 
American 
Agri- 
Women, American Cotton Producers, 
American Cotton Shippers Association, 
the American Dairy Coalition, Amer-
ican Farm Bureau Federation. 
I have got to say that the American 
Farm Bureau Federation took a real 
leadership role, so a special thanks 
there. 
But thanks to all of these groups: 
American Pulse Association, American 
Sheep Industry Association, American 
Soybean Association, American Sugar 
Alliance, Association of Equipment 
Manufacturers, Cotton Growers Ware-
house Association; Cotton Warehouse 
Association of America, Crop Insurance 
Professionals Association, National As-
sociation of Wheat Growers, National 
Barley Growers Association, National 
Cattlemen’s Beef Association, National 
Corn Growers Association, National 
Cotton Council, National Cotton Gin-
ners Association, National Council of 
Farmer Cooperatives, National Farm-
ers Union, National Milk Producers 
Federation, National Sorghum Pro-
ducers, National Sunflower Associa-
tion, Panhandle Peanut Growers Asso-
ciation, 
Plains 
Cotton 
Growers, 
Produce Marketing Association, Rural 
& Agriculture Council of America, So-
ciety of American Florists, Southeast 
Cotton Ginners Association, Southern 
Cotton Growers, Southwest Council of 
Agribusiness, U.S. Canola Association, 
U.S. Cattlemen’s Association, United 
Egg Producers, United States Peanut 
Federation, US Rice Producers Asso-
ciation, USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council, 
USA Rice, and Western Peanut Grow-
ers Association—all representing farm-
ers and ranchers. 
They produce the highest quality, 
lowest cost food supply in the world 
that benefits every single American, 
every single day. 
With pleasure I yield, for the final 
words, to our esteemed chairman. 
Mr. ROBERTS. I am not sure this is 
the final word. In the Senate of the 
United States there is no final word, I 
would assume. 
But this points out something that is 
just absolutely understandable—com-
mon sense. When people ask me how on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5803 
September 23, 2020 
Earth we got 87 votes together for a 
farm bill, with the tremendous help of 
the ranking member, Senator STABE-
NOW, it was pretty easy. 
We were holding hearings, as both of 
the Senators know. And people asked 
me: How do you get something like 
this done? 
It is just a huge undertaking. You 
have to listen to farmers. You have to 
sit on the wagon tongue and listen. 
Well, this time we didn’t have to sit 
on 
the 
wagon 
tongue 
and 
listen. 
United, they said: What on Earth is 
going on? How did this proposal get 
loose? In other words, keeping us out of 
the continuing resolution, given the 
problems that we are having, what on 
Earth is going on? 
And so it wasn’t much of a surprise 
to any of us when farmers—every one 
of them represented by the groups that 
the distinguished Senator has just list-
ed—said: Whoa. Wait a minute. We are 
getting left out. 
I think the leader in a conference 
said something about, well, other than 
the fact that we are treating agri-
culture and farmers like bums—I mean, 
it was pretty clear what was going on, 
and it was terribly counterproductive. 
I don’t know how people come up with 
these things. It is what it is. 
But we listened to farmers. We got 
the job done. We cooperated. It was bi-
partisan. 
Some of the nutrition programs were 
addressed. It was a good news story. We 
couldn’t have done it, however, with-
out the 47 groups that sounded the 
alarm. And so we have been able to do 
it over a period of about 3 or 4 or 5 
days. 
I thank everybody concerned. I think 
it is a good news story in the end re-
sult. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. Chairman, I also 
want to add Terry Van Doren to that 
list, who is here this morning on the 
floor. He worked tirelessly and stood 
firm in the negotiations. So, Terry, 
thank you to you as well. 
And, again, the final word, though, 
has to go—I think Senator BOOZMAN 
would agree with me—to our Ag chair-
man. Thanks so much. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me 
at the outset join in with my Repub-
lican colleagues. Coming from a farm 
State, I am glad that we have a bipar-
tisan continuing resolution until De-
cember 11. 
I am saddened that we don’t have the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
working 
through its normal process, nor the 
Budget Committee. This is the world 
we live in now—continuing resolutions. 
And this continuing resolution does in-
clude money for the Commodity Credit 
Corporation, which is the usual source 
of payments for agriculture programs 
agreed to in the farm bill. 
There was some question as to 
whether or not there was enough 
money in the CCC account to take care 
for the months to come. Now there is 
no question that it will be adequately 
funded. That is a positive thing. 
I also am happy to report that the 
early press reports that we saw sug-
gesting CCC funds were actually going 
to be diverted to oil companies—oil 
companies—was expressly prohibited as 
part of this negotiation. 
Understand what is behind this. 
These oil companies have benefited 
from a decision by the Trump adminis-
tration to give small refineries waivers 
when it came to the blending of eth-
anol with their product. The net result 
of that decision by the Trump adminis-
tration was that a large number of 
these small refineries were given waiv-
ers for blending, and, as a result, the 
actual production of ethanol declined 
dramatically. It is one of the major 
reasons that corn is grown and sold. It 
is for that use, and it was diminished 
dramatically. 
It was one of major reasons why, as 
the ethanol industry cratered, that 
farm income in many States was cut in 
half from what it normally has been. 
In just the last few days, there has 
been an attempt to rectify the situa-
tion, which should have been changed 
years ago, and rectifying it to say that, 
once again, there will be blending of 
ethanol with gasoline in the United 
States, which I support. And then 
someone suggested, well, let’s give an 
additional subsidy to the oil companies 
from the Commodity Credit Corpora-
tion—a terrible idea from the start. I 
am glad it is not included in this final 
product. 
Let me mention one other part of 
this that is included that I think bears 
notice, and that is the fact that there 
is an extension of the school feeding 
program for the next school year. 
We have an extraordinary situation 
with the COVID–19 pandemic where 
many schools are not bringing kids 
into the classroom. Many of these kids 
are being taught online across Amer-
ica. I know it because I know my 
grandkids are going through this. For 
those who are in lower income-quali-
fying categories, we have now extended 
in this continuing resolution the acces-
sibility of these school feeding pro-
grams for the next school year. That is 
important. Kids, if they are going to 
learn, have to have nutrition. We don’t 
want them suffering from hunger in 
the process in any way, shape, or form 
in this great Nation. 
I want to salute not just the CCC, 
which has been lauded over and over 
again in this last half hour, but this de-
cision that my side of the aisle was 
pushing for to extend school lunch and 
school feeding programs into the next 
school year. I think it will give some 
peace of mind to administrators who 
are trying to cope with the current sit-
uation. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, on a completely dif-
ferent subject—but related—we have 
lost 200,000 Americans to coronavirus. 
The predictions are that by election 
day there could be 300,000 deaths and by 
the first of next year, 400,000 deaths. 
My heart goes out to the families af-
fected. I listened as spokespeople for 
the administration talked about the 
wonderful job that they have done in 
defending 
America 
from 
the 
coronavirus. The numbers don’t back 
them up at all. 
The United States of America has 4.5 
percent of the global population, and 
yet as of this morning, we have 20 per-
cent of the COVID–19 deaths in the 
world—4.5 percent of the population, 20 
percent of the COVID–19 deaths. This 
great and powerful Nation, with the 
best doctors and hospitals and re-
searchers and pharmaceutical compa-
nies in the world, has one of the worst 
records in fighting this virus in the 
world. It is sad to think that you are 
five times more likely to be infected by 
COVID–19 in the United States than if 
you were living in Germany; twice as 
likely to be infected by COVID–19 in 
the United States than if you were liv-
ing in Canada. Canada, just across the 
border, has an infection rate half of 
what the United States has. What is it 
that they did that we didn’t do? 
Well, they came together as a nation 
with a national policy, and it worked. 
We didn’t. This President basically said 
to the Governors: You are on your own. 
As a consequence, there was a mad 
scramble to get protective equipment. 
There was a mad scramble for ventila-
tors. It was a free-for-all when it 
should have been a coordinated na-
tional policy. 
Then, when the public health experts 
told us the obvious, that we ought to 
use these masks, and we should prac-
tice social distancing, washing our 
hands, and avoiding crowds, the Presi-
dent of the United States said just the 
opposite. One day he wore a mask—I 
saw on television—when he visited a 
veterans hospital. I don’t know if he 
has ever worn one before or since. 
When the message from the public 
health experts who insisted that it was 
the best way to break the back of this 
pandemic, this President mocked them 
by holding rallies across the United 
States with all of his loyal fans point-
edly not wearing masks to show they 
really didn’t care—didn’t care about 
any of the public health advice, and we 
are paying the price for it. 
More people are infected in this 
country than Canada. We have double 
the rate here over Canada, five times 
the rate over Germany. So many more 
have died in this country who should 
be living today. The President, at var-
ious times, has said, when asked about 
the deaths: ‘‘It is what it is.’’ That is 
an off-the-cuff dismissal of the issue, 
which is beneath the dignity of any 
leader of either political party. 
Despite the urgent needs of families, 
businesses, workers, and unemployed 
Americans across the country, we 
haven’t followed through on the origi-
nal CARES Act, which passed in this 
Chamber on March 26. It was that date, 
by a vote of 96 to 0, that Republicans 
and Democrats said: We take this seri-
ously, March 26, and we are going to

September 23, 2020 
dedicate $3 trillion to make sure that 
we fight this virus and that we do ev-
erything in our power to cushion the 
shock of the economic impact of this 
virus on America. 
I went home after that, and people 
said: I can’t believe 96 to nothing. 
Democrats and Republicans agreed? 
Well, we did. There were some pro-
posals in there that were brandnew, 
such as the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram that Senators RUBIO and CARDIN 
constructed. I think I have been told 
they spent perhaps 2 weeks in writing 
this important program. Was it per-
fect? By no means. We realized, after a 
few weeks, it needed to be changed, and 
we changed it several times, but the 
concept was sound to give money to 
small businesses so they could keep 
people on the payroll, pay the mort-
gage, pay the rent, pay the utilities. 
These are the fundamentals that a 
business needed so that it might reopen 
and put people back to work. It was a 
great program. It should be extended 
even further. I think there should be a 
second round. 
I also think there should be a second 
round when it comes to unemployment 
benefits. The $600 a week, which we 
provided—which is incidentally subject 
to taxation, people should remember— 
but the $600 a week which we provided 
over and above State benefits made a 
dramatic difference in the lives of 
Americans. Critics from the outset 
said: It is going to make people lazy. 
Folks will just sit at home watching 
Netflix and eating bonbons. 
I don’t believe that. In fact, when 
you look at the reality of the situa-
tion, 70 percent of the people who have 
gone back to work in America—70 per-
cent of them—were earning less money 
at work then they did with unemploy-
ment benefits, and yet they went back 
to work. Why would they do that if it 
were just about whether you are going 
to be lazy or thrifty? It is because they 
want to be back to work for the bene-
fits, to do the work that they do and 
enjoy doing, and they knew that unem-
ployment was a temporary thing, as it 
should be, as people had an opportunity 
to return. 
So that expired July 31. The Presi-
dent has tried to extend it by Execu-
tive order. There is question as to 
whether he has the authority to do 
that. The President is also trying to do 
something which I still don’t under-
stand how to explain to anyone when it 
comes to payroll tax. He is allowing 
employers to decide whether to sus-
pend collection of the payroll tax to a 
later date. If that tax on your income 
of 6 percent or 7 percent is suspended, 
but yet you have to pay it all back at 
the beginning of the year, are Ameri-
cans prepared to have a double tax-
ation from their payroll check after 
the first of the year? In the meantime, 
that payroll tax is supposed to be used 
to fund Social Security and Medicare. 
If the President is not funding Social 
Security and Medicare, what does that 
do to the solvency and longevity of 
those programs? It raises a question as 
to whether they are going to be hurt by 
this temporary measure. It is a very 
confusing proposal by the President, 
but he has put it on the table, and we 
are now trying to sort out the impact 
it is going to have. 
We need to do more. We shouldn’t go 
home for this election empty handed 
when it comes to helping the families 
and businesses across America, and we 
need to start to help State and local 
governments. 
My State of Illinois has problems— 
plenty of them. When it comes to pen-
sions, for example, just like Kentucky, 
we have problems funding our pensions 
in Illinois. But we have a second set of 
problems created by the pandemic—the 
downturn in revenue which is going to 
have a dramatic impact on State budg-
ets in Illinois and other States. If we 
don’t help these State and local gov-
ernments get through this problem, 
they have no choice but to layoff im-
portant, vital employees—law enforce-
ment, firefighters, healthcare—just to 
name a few. 
When people talk about defunding 
the police, I am afraid that if we don’t 
give a helping hand to State and local 
governments, we are actually going to 
see the defunding of some law enforce-
ment across this country. That is why 
those on this side of the aisle have been 
pushing for State and local assistance 
as part of any package of relief that we 
pass. 
The majority leader knows this needs 
to be done. The playbook was right in 
front of him for another relief bill. We 
did it back in March with the CARES 
Act. To negotiate a real package with 
real solutions for the American people, 
the majority leader needs to show up 
at the negotiating table. It is impos-
sible to explain why Senator MCCON-
NELL
boycotted the negotiation ses-
sions between the White House and the 
Democratic leaders in Congress. There 
was an empty chair waiting for him, 
but he never filled it. 
I am introducing legislation this 
week to help workers who have been 
furloughed or laid off through the pan-
demic from losing their health insur-
ance. I can’t imagine a worse situation 
than in the midst of a public health 
crisis to lose your health insurance 
coverage. 
If you have been laid off, your op-
tions are a few—but only a few. You 
may qualify for Medicaid. It is pos-
sible. You might go to the Affordable 
Care Act and go on the exchange and 
find an insurance policy that works for 
you and your family. There is also an 
option called COBRA, where you would 
take the health insurance offered in 
your workplace and decide to keep it 
but pay the employer’s share as well as 
the employee’s share on premiums. The 
problem, of course, is that it is very ex-
pensive. 
On average, COBRA costs $600 a 
month to keep the health insurance 
you had at work for an individual, 
$1,700 a month for a family. Six hun-
dred dollars a week sounds like a lot of 
money—times 4 weeks, $2,400. But if 
$1,700 a month is going just to main-
tain your health insurance from where 
you worked, you can see there is vir-
tually no benefit. It is estimated that 
23 million workers can lose health cov-
erage during the course of this pan-
demic. That happens to just about mir-
ror the number who were given health 
insurance under the Affordable Care 
Act. Now they stand to lose—at least 
the same number stand to lose their 
health insurance because of the pan-
demic. Are we going to sit still for this 
or are we going to help these families? 
My bill, which I will be introducing 
with Senator CORTEZ MASTO and oth-
ers, will fully cover the cost of COBRA, 
enabling newly unemployed Americans 
to keep their healthcare coverage dur-
ing this difficult time. The legislation 
mirrors what passed in the Heroes Act 
in the House in May—in May, 4 months 
ago—and it is vital to help those whose 
jobs have been taken away by the pan-
demic. We have waited 4 months to do 
something here in the Senate, and we 
have done nothing. 
So MCCONNELL brought a bill up 2 
weeks ago that is so thin and so want-
ing that it really didn’t address the 
problems that this Nation faces. 
There is a new report from the Rob-
ert Wood Johnson Foundation that half 
of Chicago households report having 
lost their jobs. Some of those who lost 
their job are head of household, have 
been furloughed or are seeing reduc-
tions in wages or hours since the start 
of the pandemic. Half—half—of Chi-
cago’s households reported facing seri-
ous financial problems during the pan-
demic and have trouble caring for their 
children. Thirty-five percent reported 
that they used up all or most of their 
savings. This is a terrible situation—a 
challenging situation. We owe it to this 
country and the people we represent 
not to ignore it. 
As we know, the pandemic has dis-
proportionately affected our minority 
communities, with nearly 70 percent of 
Black families and 63 percent of Latinx 
families in Chicago reporting they are 
having serious financial problems—70 
percent of Black families, 63 percent of 
Latinx families. 
While those statistics reflect the re-
ality of many in Chicago, there is no 
doubt that this is also the story in 
many other cities across this Nation. 
That is why we need a Federal re-
sponse. We need to do what is nec-
essary to help these families, busi-
nesses, cities, and States get back on 
their feet. But instead, the Senate Re-
publicans proposed an inadequate, par-
tisan bill, with no negotiations with 
the other side of the aisle. They failed 
to prioritize the needs of struggling 
families. 
The bill has failed to provide another 
round of economic impact pay for fami-
lies or hazard pay for essential work-
ers. They fail to provide relief to 
States and local governments to help 
teachers, EMTs, firefighters, and po-
lice.

September 23, 2020 
A week from Thursday is October 1, 
which means another month’s rent will 
be due, and many families know they 
will not be able to pay it. We need help 
on a bipartisan basis. I agree with Fed-
eral Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, 
if we don’t move and move quickly to 
address this issue, the economy can 
sink even deeper, and recovery would 
be further in the distance. In the mean-
time, the death numbers in the United 
States would be even worse. 
I yield the floor.

The Senator from Idaho. 
NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, fellow 
Senators, I rise today in honor of and 
to speak about the importance of small 
businesses—in particular, in relation to 
National Small Business Week. 
Idaho’s small businesses are the en-
gine that powers our State’s economy. 
They provide us with not only goods 
and services, local jobs, and growth op-
portunities, but also immeasurable 
community value. 
With the onset and spread of COVID– 
19, this year has presented Idaho’s busi-
ness owners with challenges not seen in 
our lifetime. Even under normal cir-
cumstances, business ownership takes 
remarkable courage and commitment. 
With the pandemic, the challenges as-
sociated with entrepreneurship have 
increased 
dramatically. 
Throughout 
2020, Idaho’s small businesses have 
shown tremendous determination as 
they have strived to serve their cus-
tomers and keep their doors open to 
people in their communities. 
During this year’s National Small 
Business Week, I want to take this op-
portunity to recognize the resilience 
and 
courage 
of 
small 
businesses 
throughout the Gem State and encour-
age Idahoans to continue to support 
the local shops, restaurants, and busi-
nesses that make our communities vi-
brant. 
I firmly believe that small business 
relief is a shared, bipartisan priority. 
Here in the Senate, we will continue to 
work to deliver relief to Idaho’s small 
businesses so that we can get back on 
the path to recapturing the unprece-
dented prosperity our economy pro-
vided before this crisis began. 
Idahoans are set apart by their grit, 
self-reliance, and their deep commit-
ment to community. I am constantly 
reminded of this and proud of it when 
I see Idaho’s small businesses enduring 
and supporting one another through 
these uncertain times. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in honor of Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. Justice Ginsburg was 
a role model for many and a champion 
for all, and I was one of those. 
I would like to speak about what is 
at stake for the American public with 
this vacancy on the Court and why 
whoever is elected President in Novem-
ber should be the one who decides to 
fill this seat. 
Justice Ginsburg was, simply put, a 
phenomenal lawyer and jurist. She was 
small, and she was mighty. As a civil 
rights lawyer, she won key cases that 
established a woman’s constitutional 
right to equal treatment and confirmed 
the principle of equal rights for all. As 
a jurist, she further cemented these 
key principles into law. She brought 
them up, and she made them exist for-
ever. 
As a person, she brought smiles to 
our faces, and now she really does 
bring tears. 
Although small in stature, Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg was a formidable advo-
cate, strategist, and champion. I be-
lieve she will continue to serve as a 
major role model for generations of 
women, both young and old, for whom 
she paved the way, and I am one of 
those. We are in her debt today, and 
generations to come will be in her debt 
as well. 
Justice Ginsburg is also important to 
me personally. Her confirmation hear-
ing was the first I participated in as a 
newly elected Senator and as the first 
woman to sit on the Judiciary Com-
mittee in 1993. It was a long time ago. 
As I said before the committee in 
1993, it was not until I began preparing 
for Justice Ginsburg’s confirmation 
that I learned how she built the foun-
dation for women’s rights. Simply put, 
it was this: Before becoming a judge on 
the DC Circuit, Justice Ginsburg was 
the director of the ACLU’s Women’s 
Rights Project, where she won five 
cases before the Supreme Court. Amaz-
ing—five cases before people believed 
women had these rights. In one of these 
cases, Craig v. Boren, the Supreme 
Court held for the first time that the 
equal protection clause of the 14th 
Amendment applied to women. Can you 
believe it—actually applied to women. 
This is a very big addition because this 
really canceled out inequality. 
In other words, it is because of Jus-
tice Ginsburg’s advocacy as a lawyer 
that the government cannot discrimi-
nate against women on the basis of sex. 
For the female side of this room, this 
was really a major person whose works 
enabled us to run for this esteemed 
body and be part of it. 
It is no surprise, then, that Justice 
Ginsburg remained a fierce defender of 
women from the bench. 
She consistently reaffirmed a wom-
an’s right to choose and upheld Roe v. 
Wade against dozens of attacks. 
She invalidated the men’s-only pol-
icy at the Virginia Military Institute. 
Explaining that decision at a visit to 
VMI, Justice Ginsburg told cadets that 
she knew it ‘‘would make V.M.I. a bet-
ter place.’’ 
In 2007, she vehemently dissented in a 
case where the Court’s majority held 
that 
a 
woman—namely, 
one 
Lilly 
Ledbetter, with whom we have become 
familiar—was time-barred from suing

her employer for discrimination when 
she finally learned that her male col-
leagues had been paid more than her 
for several years. Justice Ginsburg’s 
dissent in this case became the basis 
for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, 
which we passed in 2009, making it pos-
sible to bring lawsuits when gender- 
based pay discrimination is actually 
uncovered. 
As a testament to the legal giant she 
was, Justice Ginsburg’s accomplish-
ments on behalf of women are just one 
part of her legacy, and that legacy I 
strongly believe is going to be honored 
more and more in the years to come. 
She died last Friday, just 46 days be-
fore the 2020 Presidential election. 
Importantly, 
under 
a 
Republican 
standard adopted in 2016, the Senate 
should not consider a Supreme Court 
nomination until after the inaugura-
tion of the next President, whoever 
that may be. Until recently, Repub-
licans have been intent on their own 
standard, which they used to block 
consideration 
of 
Merrick 
Garland, 
President Obama’s nominee, to fill Jus-
tice Scalia’s seat on the Court. Now, 
can we have one set of rules for Demo-
cratic Presidents and another for Re-
publican ones? I think not. To allow 
otherwise undermines not only our 
faith in Congress but also the faith of 
people that we are going to stick by 
what we do and be impartial in the ju-
dicial system. Now, just 41 days before 
the election, Senate Republicans must 
abide by their own standard. 
What is at stake? There is a great 
deal of attention this week as to whom 
the President might select. The simple 
truth, however, is this: No matter 
whom President Trump nominates, 
fundamental rights and protections 
must be considered because they be-
come at risk if the nominee doesn’t re-
spond positively and effectively to 
these. 
For example, in November, the Court 
will hear a renewed legal challenge— 
brought by the Trump administra-
tion—to the Affordable Care Act. Given 
President Trump’s promise to appoint 
a Justice who would strike down the 
Affordable Care Act, healthcare access 
and protections for the nearly 130 mil-
lion nonelderly Americans with pre-
existing conditions are really in cer-
tain peril, and we have every reason for 
serious consideration and opposition if 
this protection is not continued. 
It is unbelievable that during a pan-
demic that has already killed more 
than 200,000 Americans, this President 
and his allies are rushing a nomination 
that could leave up to 30 million Amer-
icans without healthcare. I hope that 
doesn’t happen. 
The next Justice will also decide 
cases concerning women’s reproductive 
rights, voting rights, access to justice, 
environmental protections, the rights 
of LGBT Americans, and the rights of 
American workers. Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg was a champion for all these 
rights and protections. She is very 
hard to replace, and it is important to 
think of those rights that need contin-
ued protection when the replacement is 
made by the President. 
We cannot allow the Senate and the 
President to jam through a nominee 
who will undo this legacy, which is so 
important to every American because 
every American has that legacy today, 
firm, and uses it virtually every day of 
their life. 
We are ready to fight, and we will do 
everything in our power to safeguard 
these hard-won rights and protections. 
It is really important. Of all the nomi-
nations I have sat as a fairly long-term 
member—since 1993—of the Judiciary 
Committee, 
these 
protections 
and 
rights are really all important and 
must be protected. They will be what 
we are looking at when the nominee 
comes to the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
BILLION DOLLAR BOONDOGGLE ACT 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I grew up 
on a family farm with modest means. 
As a young girl, I saw Washington, DC, 
as a place for men in big fancy suits 
and big fancy houses. While a lot has 
changed since that time—for one, there 
are a lot more women like me serving 
in the Senate—so much here is still the 
same. 
You see, too many folks in Wash-
ington get their paychecks from Amer-
ican taxpayers but don’t honor the 
folks who pay their salary. Instead of 
holding bad actors accountable, wheth-
er it is reckless spending or raunchy 
behavior on taxpayers’ time, it gets 
swept under the rug. 
Let me give you an example. I have a 
bill right now. It is called the Billion 
Dollar Boondoggle Act. It passed com-
mittee unanimously. It is actually one 
of the simplest bills I have ever intro-
duced. It literally requires the govern-
ment to report on projects that are, 
No. 1, behind schedule and, No. 2, over-
budget. It is a simple reporting require-
ment. Again, it passed through the 
committee unanimously. 
The bill has the support of my Re-
publican colleagues, but I am being 
stonewalled by my friends across the 
aisle. Folks, I cannot fathom why some 
Senate Democrats would oppose a re-
porting requirement to identify waste-
ful spending. 
You might ask: If this bill is so sim-
ple, why does it mean so much to you? 
Because it matters to my fellow Iowa 
taxpayers. They expect Washington to 
use their tax dollars wisely, not throw 
them down bottomless sinkholes that 
go unnoticed. Ask any small business 
owner in Iowa whether the bottom line 
allows them to be over-budget or be-
hind schedule. They would be out of 
business. They would be out of business 
in a heartbeat. Yet we can’t even pass 
a bill to report on these cost overruns, 
much less address them. I guess it is 
perfectly fine for Washington to take 
more and more from working families 
and small businesses. 
Folks, I think it is downright shame-
ful that we just can’t pass this simple 
bill. I will remind you again, it passed 
unanimously through committee. 
While there is a heck of a lot of polit-
ical posturing that goes on in the Sen-
ate, we have had moments when we 
have come together to rein in the tick-
er tape parade of Washington’s ex-
cesses. For instance, we passed my 
SQUEAL Act, which was signed into 
law as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act of 2017. I am proud of that effort 
because there is no reason Members of 
Congress should enjoy tax perks that 
don’t get enjoyed by everyone else. 
My bipartisan Program Management 
Improvement and Accountability Act 
was signed into law, creating more effi-
ciency and oversight in the Federal 
Government. 
I certainly have not stopped fighting 
to rein in Presidential perks. 
I have also worked with colleagues 
who couldn’t be more different from 
me politically, and we have actually 
accomplished really important things 
for the American people. I will name a 
few of those. We have fought against 
abuse in the Olympics. We have worked 
to stop prison rape. We have expanded 
telehealth and mental health services 
for our veterans. We have fought 
against opioids in our communities, 
and so much more. 
Working across the aisle really does 
take humility. It takes honesty, and it 
takes a firm belief in America and her 
people. But we can do this. I would 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
my bill and move it through the Sen-
ate. 
Living in Iowa, I am so blessed to be 
around the best people America has to 
offer. I am lucky not just to call these 
people farmers but also friends and 
neighbors. Iowans are strong. Iowans 
are resilient. And Iowans are brave. I 
have long said we need more of Iowa in 
Washington. I will keep fighting to 
make sure that happens. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, a 
5-foot-1-inch giant, Ruth Bader Gins-
burg changed this Nation—and the po-
tential of my own life—time and again, 
seeing no challenge too big and finding 
no cause too small to fight for. A 
woman with the softest voice, yet the 
most powerful words one could ever 
imagine, she made it her life’s work to 
lift up the voices of others who all too 
often had been silenced or ignored. 
With every case she argued, with 
every ruling she issued, with every dis-
sent she penned, Justice Ginsburg 
helped push our country toward that 
more perfect Union our Founders once

September 23, 2020 
wrote of in the Constitution she be-
lieved in so fiercely. 
Our democracy may have been found-
ed in the 18th century, but it wasn’t 
fully built when the ink dried on the 
Declaration of Independence. It was 
shaped and strengthened, forged and 
formed, not just by those whose faces 
loom large on Mount Rushmore but by 
someone who was often the smallest, 
quietest person in nearly every room 
she ever walked into. It is because of 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s brilliance and 
resilience that so many of us have the 
rights we too often take for granted, 
and it is because of her that who I am 
today is possible. 
Long before she was a Supreme Court 
Justice, she was a relatively unknown 
law school professor who altered the 
course of history when she argued that 
the equal protection promised under 
the 14th Amendment didn’t just mean 
equal protection for men. Her legal ge-
nius was captured in her first land-
mark victory and reflected in her 
choice of a male plaintiff to dem-
onstrate that discrimination on the 
basis of sex harms every American, 
male and female alike. 
Suddenly, thanks to this idealistic, 
young lawyer who spent her own law 
school years having her place ques-
tioned because of her sex, it became il-
legal to discriminate against women 
because they happened to be women. 
That same tenacity, that same trail-
blazing intellect, that same woman 
also helped pave the way for me to suc-
ceed in my career as a woman in the 
military. 
In 1973, she made sure that the equal 
rights for women she had helped to se-
cure extended to the women who were 
seeking to defend our Nation, arguing 
and winning her first case in front of 
the Supreme Court—getting the Jus-
tices to rule in an 8-to-1 fashion that 
the military could not give a female 
servicemember fewer benefits than her 
male counterparts. 
Her life, her position, and her title 
changed over the next couple of dec-
ades, as we all well know, but her con-
victions did not. It was 23 years after 
standing in front of the bench of the 
highest Court in the land to argue that 
our Armed Forces could not discrimi-
nate against a woman in their ranks 
that Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself sat 
on that very same bench and issued a 
ruling that changed everything for 
countless women who dreamed of serv-
ing their country in uniform. She 
struck down the State-funded Virginia 
Military Institute’s male-only accept-
ance policy, granting women the abil-
ity to learn and train alongside men at 
one of the top military academies in 
the Nation. 
In a ruling I plan to read out loud to 
my little girls some nights instead of 
their usual bedtime stories, she wrote 
of potential female VMI students, argu-
ing: ‘‘Generalizations about ‘the way 
women are,’ estimates of what is ap-
propriate for most women, no longer 
justify denying opportunity to women 
whose talent and capacity place them 
outside the average description.’’ 
I can’t begin to imagine the number 
of women generals and flag officers and 
servicemembers she paved the way for 
with those rulings, but I do know the 
story of one, not a flag officer—just 
me, myself. 
As I was a couple years into the 
Army when she wrote that decision, 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg helped make my 
career in the military possible. She 
helped make my hope of one day serv-
ing in a combat role regardless of my 
gender, of one day commanding a 
unit—despite most of my crew being 
men—achievable. It was because of her 
that my dreams had the opportunity to 
become a reality. 
You know, yesterday, I told my 5- 
year-old, Abigail—named for Abigail 
Adams, another feminist—that we were 
taking a field trip instead of our usual 
homeschooling routine, and I took her 
and her younger sister, Maile, to the 
steps of the highest Court in the land. 
I didn’t expect to get emotional, and I 
didn’t expect to tear up, but with Maile 
in my lap and Abigail by my side, I 
started to cry. I was crying because it 
was not just my military career Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg helped to make pos-
sible but my family too. 
I may never have been able to be-
come a mom if it were not for Justice 
Ginsburg. Without her, without what 
she did to safeguard healthcare and re-
productive freedoms, I might never 
have been able to get pregnant through 
IVF. I might never have been able to 
have my two little girls; never would 
have been able to watch Abigail place a 
bouquet of white roses on the steps of 
the Supreme Court if Ruth Bader Gins-
burg hadn’t spent decades in that very 
same building, defending my rights. 
She changed—no, she gave me the op-
portunity to achieve my life as it is 
today. 
Her passing isn’t just heartbreaking 
for me and for countless other women 
across this country; it is a loss for our 
entire Nation. It is a loss for justice, a 
loss for equality. 
While today I will continue to mourn 
everything we lost when she passed 
last Friday, I promise that tomorrow I 
am going to roll up my sleeves and 
honor her in the way I believe to be 
most true to how she lived her life—by 
fighting like hell for what is right and 
for all of our rights. 
My daughters might be too young to 
remember going to the Supreme Court 
to pay our respects to RBG, but they 
will know her legacy, and already, 
every day, they are living proof of its 
power. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

HOUSING REPORT 
Mr. 
BROWN. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
coronavirus has been the great revealer 
in our country. This crisis, of course, 
isn’t happening in a vacuum. It is lay-
ered atop a system that already was 
not working for a whole lot of people 
and that had centuries of racism built 
into it. 
Few places is that more true than in 
our housing system. When it comes to 
housing, like so many problems in this 
country, we have a President who 
makes things worse, not better. For 4 
years now, President Trump and his 
administration 
have 
systematically 
undermined fair housing. 
I would add, since the Senator from 
Utah is in the Presiding Officer’s chair, 
that I would do a shout-out for his fa-
ther and what he did as Secretary of 
HUD in the late sixties, early seventies 
in trying to move this country forward. 
That was obviously not in my pre-
pared remarks. I didn’t know that you 
would be presiding, but thank you. 
The Trump agenda—very different 
from the agenda in the Romney HUD 
administration—turned back the clock 
on civil rights protections that leave 
communities of color, people with dis-
abilities, and LGBTQ people behind. 
This week I released a comprehensive 
report from the Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs Committee, detailing the 
ways that President Trump has made 
inequality and segregation in housing 
worse and the work we have to do to 
undo the damage. 
More than 50 years after Congress 
passed the Fair Housing Act, access to 
housing remains not just unequal but 
separate and unequal. 
The contours of our country are too 
often still defined by Black, Latino, 
Asian or White neighborhoods, all with 
very different levels of access to re-
sources—schools, 
grocery 
stores, 
healthcare, clean air and water, public 
safety. 
This is not an accident; it has been 
done by design. For decades, the Fed-
eral Government not only condoned 
housing segregation and discrimina-
tion—perhaps 
unbelievably, 
perhaps 
not—it actively promoted it. 
We all know about Black codes. We 
know about Jim Crow, even if too 
many want to deny we are still living 
with this Jim Crow legacy today. It 
wasn’t just the most blatant racist 
laws; discrimination was woven into 
the creation of our modern housing 
system from the beginning. 
After the Great Depression, Presi-
dent Roosevelt created the govern-
ment-sponsored Home Owners’ Loan 
Corporation, the HOLC, and the Fed-
eral Housing Administration, the FHA. 
These could have been tools for ex-
panding 
opportunity 
for 
everyone. 
They did that for White Americans, but 
for Black Americans they did the oppo-
site. HOLC partnered with local real 
estate agents and appraisers to make 
what they called residential security 
maps. These maps used color coding to 
differentiate between supposedly high-

risk and low-risk neighborhoods, with 
green signifying the best neighbor-
hoods and red indicating a so-called 
hazardous area. 
Neighborhoods that were home to 
people of color—even a small percent-
age—were marked ‘‘declining’’ or ‘‘haz-
ardous.’’ That is what we know as red-
lining. 
It was despicable racism, woven into 
the fabric of our housing system. We 
still live with the results. Capital, in 
the form of low-cost, stable mortgages, 
flowed to White neighborhoods—like 
the neighborhood in which I grew up in 
Mansfield, OH—and dried up in Black 
neighborhoods or neighborhoods that 
were home to immigrants. 
White borrowers were able to build 
wealth through home ownership that 
could be passed down through families. 
Our government systematically denied 
Black families the same wealth-build-
ing opportunity. 
From 1934 through 1962, 98 percent— 
98 percent—of all FHA mortgages went 
to White homeowners—98 percent. 
It wasn’t until Dr. King’s assassina-
tion in 1968 that Congress finally 
passed the Fair Housing Act to outlaw 
discrimination and promote integrated 
communities. The Fair Housing Act 
was followed by the Home Mortgage 
Disclosure Act and Equal Credit Oppor-
tunity Act and the Community Rein-
vestment Act. These laws all provided 
powerful tools to root out discrimina-
tion and to invest in underserved com-
munities. 
But for too long, those laws simply 
weren’t implemented. 
Administrations of both parties ig-
nored the Fair Housing Act’s require-
ment that the Federal Government— 
this is a legal term—affirmatively fur-
ther fair housing. Minority commu-
nities, 
though, 
remained 
under-
invested. It took decades for all courts 
to say that if a housing policy has a 
discriminatory effect, it is, in fact, dis-
criminatory. That is pretty simple. If a 
housing policy has a discriminatory ef-
fect, it is, in fact, discriminatory. 
The government also didn’t collect 
enough housing data to root out dis-
criminatory 
housing 
that 
fed 
the 
subprime mortgage crisis. We know the 
2008 crisis stripped away much of the 
housing wealth that families of color 
had fought for. 
Today, access to housing and all the 
opportunity and stability that comes 
with it remains unequal. The African- 
American home ownership rate is near-
ly 30 percentage points below the White 
home 
ownership 
rate—30 
percent 
below. Analysts have tried to explain 
the diversity with income and edu-
cation as factors, but it never tells the 
whole story. With all else equal, simi-
larly situated African Americans are 
markedly less likely to own a home 
than their White counterparts. 
Black and Latino renters are also 
more likely to pay a larger share of 
their income toward housing than 
White renters, making it even harder 
to get by, even harder to save to buy a 
home. 
We know—and many of us have re-
peated many times—that one-quarter 
of renters in this country pay at least 
half their income in rent and utilities, 
meaning if one thing happens in their 
life—their car breaks down, their child 
gets sick, or they have a minor work-
place injury that keeps them out of 
work 4 or 5 days—everything in their 
lives can turn upside down. They can 
be evicted and all that happens with 
that. That is the legacy of redlining 
and racial exclusion at work. 
During 
the 
last 
administration, 
President 
Obama 
made 
significant 
strides in enforcing civil rights laws 
that have been on the book for decades. 
But 
instead 
of 
continuing 
that 
progress, President Trump has simply 
choked that progress. He has turned 
back the clock. He has undone the 
progress that so many of us fought for. 
Over the past 4 years, the Trump ad-
ministration has done several affirma-
tive—if you will—affirmative things to 
discriminate—not just that it didn’t 
get around to enforcing, but it has 
done things that, by themselves, have 
caused damage to the progress we have 
made. 
He appointed an OCC Director who 
undermined the Community Reinvest-
ment Act by making it less likely that 
banks will provide the loans, invest-
ments, and services that these commu-
nities need. 
The Trump administration cut back 
on housing data collection, allowing 
lending 
discrimination 
to 
go 
un-
checked. 
The administration tried to make 
mortgages more expensive and harder 
to get, particularly for people of color. 
The administration denied opportuni-
ties for home ownership to hundreds of 
thousands of young adults. 
The Trump administration forced 
families to choose between access to 
affordable 
housing 
and 
food 
and 
healthcare and a path to citizenship. 
The administration gutted the so- 
called disparate impact standard that 
helps root out policies that have hid-
den discriminatory effects. 
The Trump administration disman-
tled the affirmatively furthering fair 
housing rule, essentially telling com-
munities around the country: Don’t 
even bother trying to create a better, 
more equal housing system, and we 
will not help you if you want to. 
On and on and on it goes. 
I invite everyone to read our report 
and join us to take action. We have our 
work cut out for us to undo the damage 
President Trump has done and to get 
to work to actually erase the legacy of 
redlining and the legacy of Jim Crow 
and build a housing system that works 
for everyone. 
Housing is the foundation of so much 
in life, and when people start behind 
because they can’t get access to clean, 
accessible, fair—fair and safe housing, 
they, in many cases, simply can’t catch 
up. 
We have to restore the Fair Housing 
Act to its full strength. This means 
providing the tools to help commu-
nities create more inclusive housing 
markets, to end home lending discrimi-
nation, to strengthen fair housing 
oversight. 
We must break down barriers to 
home ownership and redesign our hous-
ing finance system so that it better 
serves Black and Brown communities. 
We have to protect the basic premise 
that LGBTQ people seeking shelter 
should be treated with the same dig-
nity and respect as every other person. 
I think some of these are just so obvi-
ous, so important in a society like 
ours. I will say that one again—the 
basic premise that LGBTQ people seek-
ing shelter should be treated with the 
same dignity and respect as every 
other American. 
We must provide long-overdue invest-
ments in housing and community de-
velopment in communities of color. 
Black families and other communities 
of color have endured too many dec-
ades of our country’s housing policies 
failing them. 
The same year we passed the Fair 
Housing Act, Dr. King gave a speech we 
call ‘‘The Other America.’’ In that 
speech, here is what he said: 
Our nation has constantly taken a positive 
step forward on the question of racial justice 
and racial equality. But over and over again 
at the same time, it made certain backward 
steps. 
The Trump administration is that 
backward step. Fundamentally, we all 
pretty much want the same thing—a 
home that is safe in a community we 
care about, where we can get to work 
and our kids have a good school, with 
room for our family, whether that is 
three kids or an aging parent or simply 
a beloved pet. 
You should get to define what home 
looks like for you. You should be able 
to find it. You should be able to afford 
it. You should be able to do it without 
the crippling stress of ‘‘Can I meet my 
rent payment or my mortgage every 
month?’’ 
For too many Black and Brown fami-
lies, that has been out of reach—to find 
it, to afford it, to live in it without 
crippling stress. 
Congress cannot ignore these chal-
lenges. We can’t keep allowing the 
Trump administration to gut the tools 
we have to make people’s lives better. 
If we want to make the economy 
work better for everyone—including 
communities of color that have been 
systematically excluded from oppor-
tunity—we cannot shrink from these 
challenges. That is the purpose of the 
report we are issuing today. When 
work has dignity, everyone can find 
and afford a place to call home. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PROTECT AND SERVE ACT 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, across 
the country, Americans watched in 
horror as news stations reported the 
shooting of two sheriff’s deputies in 
Los Angeles, who were brutally tar-
geted by a murderous, violent criminal. 
In North Carolina, just 2 days earlier, 
sheriff’s deputy Ryan Hendrix, a father 
of two young children, a man planning 
to get married, was murdered in cold 
blood while responding to a family 
under siege by an evil criminal. 
So far in 2020 alone, 37 law enforce-
ment officers have been murdered by 
violent criminals and hundreds have 
been wounded while protecting our 
communities. 
Despite these senseless deaths and 
the gruesome violence against police, 
there are those who support radical 
ideas like defunding or abolishing the 
police. These dangerous policies would 
allow criminals to roam free through-
out our communities, unchallenged and 
unafraid. 
The agitators pushing to abolish the 
police have sown the seeds of discord in 
our country by disrespecting law en-
forcement and disregarding their brave 
service to our Nation. Just look at 
Asheville, NC. Since June 1, over 30 po-
lice officers have left the law enforce-
ment profession. These brave men and 
women are tired of being attacked 
physically, emotionally, and person-
ally, simply for trying to keep their 
communities safe, every single damn 
day. 
They put on a uniform to go protect 
their community, not sure if they are 
going to come back safe, and they do it 
anyway, and we owe them a debt of 
gratitude. But they are sick of the op-
portunistic politicians like the Demo-
cratic leader and AOC attacking them 
for just doing their jobs. 
Worst of all is the specter of targeted 
attacks like those against the deputies 
in Los Angeles. The harmful rhetoric 
being used by the radical, anti-police 
leftists encourages an environment of 
hostility, which emboldens criminals 
and murderers. The result is brazen at-
tacks against law enforcement officers 
in broad daylight. 
In light of the toxic environment 
being created in this country, which 
devalues police, I believe the Senate 
must act to protect law enforcement 
officers and show them our support. 
That is why I have introduced the Pro-
tect and Serve Act with 16 of my Re-
publican colleagues. 
The Protect and Serve Act would 
punish criminals who target law en-
forcement officers and harm them. 
These criminals will receive up to 10 
years in prison, and if they murder or 
kidnap a law enforcement officer, they 
will get a life sentence. 
It is sad that Congress even needs to 
consider a bill to protect police offi-
cers, but let me be clear: Attacks 
against any law enforcement officers 
are no laughing matter. Congress must 
pass the Protect and Serve Act imme-
diately and boldly say there is no es-
cape from justice for dangerous crimi-
nals who intentionally assault or kill a 
law enforcement officer. 
Today, I call on every single Demo-
crat to support this commonsense leg-
islation. The question is simple: Do 
you support the men and women in 
blue who fight every day to keep our 
communities safe or do you support 
lawless, reckless, liberal mobs who 
want to defund the police? 
It is a yes-or-no question. You either 
back the blue or you back anarchy. 
As long as I am a U.S. Senator I will 
do everything I can to protect our men 
and women who protect our commu-
nities every single day. I expect and 
they deserve no less. 
I hope my Democratic colleagues can 
stand up to AOC, the Squad, and their 
radical liberal base and do the same. It 
is time to back the blue. It is time to 
restore safety in our communities. It is 
time to end the killing of law enforce-
ment officers and people just trying to 
protect us every single day. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I 
want to talk for a few minutes about 
securing our election process. 
At various times, in the last 4 years, 
there have been different levels of rea-
sons why the Federal Government 
needed to take over the election proc-
ess. For a while, it was that the process 
was too easily infiltrated by outside in-
fluences, and then it was COVID–19, 
and it was important that everybody 
vote in different ways than they have 
ever voted before, and somehow only 
the Federal Government could manage 
that. 
I would say that, in that, just as we 
look toward the 2020 elections, we have 
spent over $1 billion. I think it is $1.2 
billion in funding from the Congress. 
We have had dozens of hearings in the 
Rules Committee, the Judiciary Com-
mittee, and the Homeland Security 
Committee. There was a 31⁄2-year bipar-
tisan investigation that I was part of 
as part of the Intelligence Committee, 
and we have looked at this about every 
way we can. 
Right now, people across the country 
are beginning the process of casting 
their votes. This year, more than any 
other year up until now, we will have 
election day, but, really, we will have 
more like ‘‘election month,’’ and, in 
some States, it is going to be ‘‘election 
6 weeks’’ or ‘‘election 7 weeks.’’ 
So this process is starting right now. 
It is a process where people will decide 
who represents them in the White 
House and the Congress; or, in some 
cases, in city hall; in many cases, the 
Governor’s mansion; and in almost all 
cases, the general assembly; and in all 
cases, the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. 
Confidence in the voting process is 
the thread that holds the fabric of de-
mocracy together. Every time we need-
lessly get into a discussion about 
whether this process is fair or safe, I 
think it is harmful. Every time we 
need to have that discussion about 
whether it is fair or safe, it is, of 
course, not only helpful but totally ap-
propriate. 
This is the time when we need to be 
sure that our work has brought us to a 
good conclusion, rather than talking 
about the fact that the system is not 
going to work. The system is going to 
work. As the chairman of the Rules 
Committee, where we have the prin-
cipal election jurisdiction, or as a 
member of the Intelligence Committee, 
I spent a lot of time looking at this. I 
think we have been very serious in the 
Senate, particularly, in considering 
these issues and at looking at the 
threats to our election system itself. 
I am not going to talk much in the 
next few minutes about false informa-
tion and other things. In my view, all 
you have to do is turn on the television 
to find some false information and 
watch 
the 
campaign 
commercials. 
There is a nugget of truth, perhaps, but 
most of them—many of them have lit-
tle more than a nugget of truth in 
them. 
Sure, I am concerned about false in-
formation. I am particularly concerned 
about it if it comes from foreign gov-
ernments, from those who wish our 
country ill. But there is a lot of infor-
mation out there—a lot more informa-
tion than there has ever been before— 
and people should be very thoughtful 
about the information they take in. 
I am not going to talk a lot about 
that. I want to talk about the election 
system itself because, in my view, the 
election-day system is as secure as it 
has ever been. The registration system 
is as secure as it has ever been. 
Four years ago, the Obama adminis-
tration—a little later than this—said: 
There is a big problem, and we are 
going to declare the election structure 
a structure of national significance, 
and we are going to play a different 
role than we have ever played before. 
There was no anticipation that this 
was going to happen and not much dis-
cussion. 
Election officials all over the coun-
try immediately said: Oh, no, you are 
not. You are not going to just decide in 
October of an election year that you 
are going to take over the election sys-
tem and declare it a system of national 
significance, a system of critical sig-
nificance to the future of the Nation. 
Of course it is, but it didn’t become 
that in October of 2016. 
But the message was clear that we 
needed to build those stronger ties 
with local and State election authori-
ties. We needed to do everything we

September 23, 2020 
could, as we saw the efforts by some 
foreign actors and some people in their 
basements trying to see if they could 
get into the voter registration system 
and do something with it. We have 
done more of that—well, we have done 
all we can think of, in my view. We did 
a lot of it before 2018, and that never 
stopped. 
For 20 years, Congress has done all 
we can think of to help make the sys-
tem work better. We have spent over $1 
billion in the past 4 years. We have en-
couraged them to update, and we have 
seen updates of antiquated systems. 
Systems that didn’t have a ballot trail 
and other things have all been gen-
erally replaced, and where they haven’t 
been, I think they are on even higher 
alert. We have helped them increase 
their cyber security. We have re-
sponded to COVID–19 with help to local 
governments, which in some cases was 
used for establishing polling places and 
even maybe paying extra to election 
judges. 
While we provided those resources, it 
has been for a long time and still is up 
to local and State officials, who are the 
closest to the people they work for, to 
do everything they can to secure those 
elections. I spent about 20 years doing 
that, part of it as a local election offi-
cial in Missouri, a county official, and 
part of it as the Missouri secretary of 
state, the chief election official. 
Earlier this month, I had a chance to 
be in Kansas City when the county 
clerks and election authorities were all 
meeting. Most of them were there at a 
distanced meeting to talk about elec-
tion responsibility. Others were vir-
tually there to talk again about the ab-
solute commitment they have made to 
the people they work for to conduct 
elections in a way that is both free and 
fair. I think that is what is going to 
happen. 
Clearly, again, there are efforts by 
foreign 
adversaries—Russia, 
China, 
Iran, North Korea, and others—to 
interfere with our elections, but we 
want to be sure and I believe have been 
sure that Federal agencies have been 
providing the resources they needed to 
investigate bad actors, to punish bad 
actors, and to do everything they could 
to protect the American election sys-
tem. 
We are in a much different place than 
we were 4 years ago. Election authori-
ties—State and, in many cases, local— 
know the name of the person at Home-
land Security with whom they have 
had now a 4-year relationship or a 2- 
year relationship or a 1-year relation-
ship, and when they get a call the day 
before the election, they are going to 
know that is a call from somebody who 
not only is there to help them that day 
but has been there to help them up 
until now. 
The Rules Committee has held four 
hearings since the 2018 election—one on 
election security, one on how we are 
preparing for the 2020 election, one on 
oversight of the U.S. Election Assist-
ance Commission, and in addition to 
that, putting people on the Federal 
Election Commission to fill vacancies 
that had been there for a long time. 
The Judiciary Committee has looked 
into things like the social media com-
panies 
that 
are 
trying 
to 
stop 
disinformation. 
Homeland Security has drawn out a 
roadmap and has put the kinds of pro-
tections into the system that you want 
to have in the system for equipment 
that counts votes, the registration sys-
tem that is available on election day. 
The Intelligence Committee, as I said 
before, conducted a 31⁄2-year investiga-
tion on foreign meddling in the last 
election, and the administration is 
holding those perpetrators account-
able. 
The Justice Department has secured 
indictments 
against 
three 
Russian 
companies. Twenty-six people involved 
with Russia’s influence campaign in 
2016 have been impacted by that. The 
Justice Department has sanctioned 46 
other people and 18 businesses. 
One of the things we didn’t have in 
2016 was a cyber offense. We had a 
cyber defense and I think the best in 
the world at that moment—I hope it 
still is—but we didn’t have a cyber of-
fense. 
I remember being in an Intel hearing 
in 2017—this was early 2017—when the 
question was put to our intel commu-
nity: Have you ever been told by the 
President of the United States that 
you should have offensive action taken 
against these bad actors? The answer 
by all of them was no. But it was 
March or April of 2017. The President of 
the United States who hadn’t given 
that direction for the previous years 
was not the current President, who, 
not too long after that, did give that 
direction. 
By 2018, when we sought cyber of-
fense, we had our own cyber offense. 
They know who they are, and they 
know the price they paid and the price 
they would pay again. Thousands of 
members of the intelligence commu-
nity have been working to keep an eye 
on that part of keeping our elections 
secure. 
Providing Federal support to State 
and local officials is the right ap-
proach. Frankly, I have been in favor 
of providing a little more yet this year, 
but that appears to be part of a bill 
that we just can’t seem to agree to 
even though somewhere between the 
targeted Senate bill and the Problem 
Solvers’ bipartisan bill in the House 
that was released a week or so ago, 
there is clearly a settlement there that 
would likely include a little more elec-
tion security assistance. But we are 
getting pretty late to add much to the 
system; we need to now be sure that 
what is in the system really works. We 
don’t need a Federal takeover. 
Many of you heard me say before 
that late in 2016, President Obama said: 
‘‘There is no serious person out there 
who would suggest somehow that you 
could even rig America’s elections, in 
part because they’re so decentralized in 
the numbers of votes involved.’’ I think 
he is exactly right. The diversity of the 
system is the strength of the system. 
I personally think the best place to 
vote is at a polling place on election 
day. I don’t always get to vote that 
way. But if you want to have all the in-
formation that happens between the 
start of the campaign and the day you 
vote, the only way you get that is vot-
ing on election day. If you want to see 
your ballot go into a ballot box or into 
the counting system and know that 
happened, you better get that on elec-
tion day. 
But many people will vote in other 
ways, particularly this year. Usually, 
the other ways are a little more com-
plicated, but they are still protected by 
comparison 
of 
signatures 
in 
most 
States. Usually, there is still going to 
be included an indication on the voter 
roll that goes to the polling place that 
somebody has already received another 
ballot. There are safeguards there. 
For reasons we all understand, more 
people are going to vote earlier in this 
election than ever before. I know our 
election officials in our State and I sus-
pect all over the country are planning 
for what they can do to still have the 
most information available possible on 
election night, but it is unlikely that 
we are going to know everything we 
want to know on election night. 
If you don’t want to vote at a polling 
place on election day or can’t vote at a 
polling place on election day, you 
should still vote. Confidence in every-
thing you hear or read should not be 
complete, but I think confidence that 
the election system itself is going to 
tabulate the results that came in and 
the votes that were cast is a pretty 
safe bet. 
Politics can become heated and noisy 
during an election season, but at the 
end of the day, the American people 
need to understand that we are doing 
all we can to give them the ability to 
cast their ballots with minimal obsta-
cles and maximum confidence that 
what happens on election day is what 
the voters voted to do on election day. 
With that, I yield the floor.

CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
this is a ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ good 
news-bad news speech. 
The good news from last week is on 
business community support for carbon 
pricing. What is carbon pricing? Well, 
remember that IMF—the International 
Monetary Fund—pegs the fossil fuel 
subsidy in the United States at more 
than $600 billion per year, so the en-
ergy market is dramatically tilted to 
favor fossil fuels. Carbon pricing helps

September 23, 2020 
set that right, helps make an even 
playing field. It is economics 101. And 
carbon pricing makes a lot of sense. 
What happened last week? The Busi-
ness Roundtable, made up of all of 
these giant American corporations and 
more—these are the top 50 that I could 
fit on this chart, but there are 200 of 
them—came out in support of carbon 
pricing. Their report warned that the 
consequences of climate change for 
global prosperity and socioeconomic 
well-being are significant. The world 
simply cannot afford the costs of inac-
tion. 
The Business Roundtable’s report 
went on to urge companies to ‘‘align 
policy goals and [greenhouse gas] emis-
sions reduction targets with scientific 
evidence.’’ Listen to the scientists. We 
could do more of that. 
The BRT said that a key component 
of science-based climate policy should 
be a price on carbon. Here is what they 
said: 
A price on carbon would provide an effec-
tive incentive to reduce [greenhouse gas] 
emissions and mitigate climate change, in-
cluding through the development and deploy-
ment of breakthrough technologies. . . . Es-
tablishing a clear price signal is the most 
important— 
The most important— 
consideration for encouraging innovation, 
driving efficiency, and ensuring sustained 
environmental and economic effectiveness. 
So this is big news—these are big 
companies—and this is good news. 
These 
companies 
at 
the 
Business 
Roundtable employ more than 15 mil-
lion people. They have more than $7.5 
trillion in revenues. Their unified voice 
is a good thing and a big deal. 
With all of that good news from all of 
these big American corporations, what 
is the bad news? The bad news is that 
corporate America often shows one 
face to the world and a very different 
face to Congress, and the face they 
show to Congress is not at all aligned 
with this policy they just announced to 
the world. This discrepancy, this mis-
alignment, is a persistent problem, and 
it needs to be fixed. 
The problem has three dimensions. 
One, even these companies don’t pay 
much attention to climate change in 
their lobbying and election activities. 
For most, it is zero attention. 
By the way, that silence is deafening 
around here, and that silence by these 
companies is compounded by the trade 
associations through which they con-
solidate their lobbying work. Most 
trade associations do nothing on cli-
mate. 
Here is Coke and Pepsi’s trade asso-
ciation. By the way, here are Pepsi and 
Coke on the list of companies that 
joined the Business Roundtable pro-cli-
mate, pro-carbon-price statement. But 
when they lobby, here is their Amer-
ican Beverage Association, the trade 
association. As you can see, they 
haven’t been spending much money 
lately, and they haven’t been spending 
anything on climate. 
In 2009 and in 2010, they spent a lot of 
money. Why? Because we were starting 
to work on ObamaCare and there was 
an idea that the companies that sold 
sugary beverages that created health 
issues should help pay the cost of the 
health issues that their sweetened bev-
erages created. So off to battle went 
the American Beverage Association 
with millions and millions of dollars in 
spending. 
This, by the way, is just the number 
of lobbyists. This is their spending. So 
if they cared about climate change and 
wanted to put a little bit of lobby pres-
sure on, this is what they are capable 
of doing. This is what they are doing. 
Here is a pitch, in my hands right 
here, entitled ‘‘TechNet: Remaining 
Legislative Priorities for 2020.’’ This is 
13 pages of advocacy for all the things 
the tech sector wants from Congress 
through 
their 
trade 
association, 
TechNet—13 pages. The list goes on and 
on. ‘‘Top priorities,’’ and then page 
after page, in small print, of all the pri-
orities, of all the things that they want 
Congress to do for them—and there is 
not 
a 
single 
mention 
of 
climate 
change, not a single mention of carbon 
price. 
What do you think Congress will re-
spond to—general noise made to the 
world or your specific asks to Con-
gress? 
Here is the list of companies whose 
CEOs signed that Business Roundtable 
report and came out for action on cli-
mate and a carbon price and who are 
also in TechNet, which, the week be-
fore, came here with 13 pages of legisla-
tive priorities that didn’t include ei-
ther climate change or carbon price. 
You have to line things up, you guys. 
These are big players. Look at them: 
Honeywell, Amazon, Microsoft, Cisco, 
Dell, Visa, GM, Apple, Comcast, Oracle, 
Accenture, 
Hewlett-Packard, 
and 
PayPal—all on both sides of the issue 
within the same week here in Congress. 
So those are the trade associations 
that do nothing on this issue. 
It gets worse because there are trade 
associations that are our worst en-
emies on climate action. In fact, 
InfluenceMap has done some research 
and tracked which groups and which 
corporations are the most climate 
friendly and which are the most cli-
mate hostile. If you look all the way 
over, right next to Marathon Petro-
leum in hostility is the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce. There was actually a tie. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 
the National Association of Manufac-
turers were statistically tied as the 
two worst climate obstructers in Amer-
ica. 
So they are out here, having worked 
hammer and tongs to stop climate leg-
islation and prevent a carbon price, 
and you have the Business Roundtable 
statement supporting action on cli-
mate change and supporting a carbon 
price. 
So here are the companies that are 
members of the Business Roundtable 
and came out last week for action on 
climate change and supported a carbon 
price and that are also members of the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which re-
lentlessly opposes all serious climate 
action and, specifically, a carbon price. 
Look at them all. Look at them all. 
I don’t know if the camera can pan in 
on that, but these are some of Amer-
ica’s biggest corporations. I would bet 
you that, if this group said, ‘‘Hey, we 
have just made a new decision over in 
the Business Roundtable, wearing our 
Business Roundtable hat,’’ and went to 
the Chamber and said, ‘‘We are not 
going to do your opposition any longer; 
we are not going to support your oppo-
sition to climate action; we are actu-
ally serious about being for climate ac-
tion and a carbon price’’—if all of those 
companies actually said that to the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and threat-
ened to quit if they didn’t clean up 
their act at the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, that would make a very big dif-
ference. 
And around here that would make a 
very big difference because the Cham-
ber is the biggest kahuna of lobbying. 
It is electioneering all the time, usu-
ally against Democrats, almost inevi-
tably for the worst candidate on cli-
mate, and they are over in courts and 
in regulatory agencies opposing cli-
mate action all the time. So why sup-
port that if what you really support is 
doing something on climate, including 
a carbon price? 
So the National Association of Manu-
facturers was the other group in a tie 
with the Chamber for America’s worst 
climate obstructer. These are all the 
companies whose CEOs signed the Busi-
ness Roundtable statement supporting 
climate action and supporting carbon 
pricing and are members of one of the 
two worst climate obstructers in Amer-
ica, at the same time. So that creates 
a little bit of a problem. 
Now, I should go back to the Cham-
ber one just briefly and put a caveat in 
here. We don’t know who all the Cham-
ber members are. It is a very secretive 
organization. Many of its members re-
port that they are members of the or-
ganization, and that is how we can as-
semble a list like this. But if the com-
pany doesn’t report that they are mem-
bers, we don’t know. 
So this is not necessarily complete, 
but this is all that we can know out of 
this secretive, very oppositional, worst 
climate obstructer organization—the 
Chamber of Commerce. 
There 
are 
some 
other 
odd 
discordances 
among 
these 
Business 
Roundtable leaders. We go back to 
Business Roundtable membership who 
signed on this; that is, companies like 
Google, Amazon, AT&T, and Verizon, 
which are on the BRT list. There is 
Verizon right there. They are donors to 
something called the Competitive En-
terprise Institute. 
The Competitive Enterprise Institute 
is the group that put that flagrant, 
some would say almost nutty, climate 
denier Myron Ebell onto the EPA tran-
sition team. The Competitive Enter-
prise Institute is a dramatic antagonist 
to either anything serious on climate

September 23, 2020 
or a price on carbon. Yet companies 
that signed this Business Roundtable 
statement support the Competitive En-
terprise Institute. 
Many people will remember when we 
came to the floor in groups of Senators 
to talk about the web of denial and the 
web of front groups that the fossil fuel 
industry set up to hide their hands and 
do their dirty work and stop climate 
action in Congress. That is the Com-
petitive 
Enterprise 
Institute 
right 
there—right there, right smack in the 
middle of the web of fossil-fuel-funded 
climate denial, and Google, Amazon, 
AT&T, and Verizon were all supporting 
that group while supporting the Busi-
ness Roundtable. 
Now, none of this would matter much 
if Congress was just a sideshow and it 
was really up to corporations to do 
their own thing, but that is not the 
case. Action in Congress is actually the 
main event in succeeding on climate. 
That is why the fossil fuel industry has 
worked so hard to set up this web to 
deny climate science and to obstruct 
climate action here in Congress. 
So when these Business Roundtable 
companies come to Congress through 
their other groups and say, ‘‘Don’t 
bother on climate’’ or ‘‘Don’t do a car-
bon price,’’ it matters. And it makes it 
a little hard to really take action in 
Congress based on their statement that 
they support climate action and a car-
bon price when, through other groups, 
they are funding the opposition to the 
position that they claim to support. 
So, to the BRT, thank you for what 
you did. I don’t want to under appre-
ciate that. It is a big deal. It is a good, 
good thing. But now you have to make 
it real. You have to make it real in 
Congress. No more zero effort from 
you. No more zero effort from your 
trade associations. No more support for 
our biggest climate obstructers from 
you. 
If you want the results of what you 
asked for, you have to align your ac-
tions in Congress with your values. 
Align what you say in that statement 
with what you do through your groups 
here in Congress. That ought not to be 
much to ask—to align what you do in 
Congress with what you say you want 
to do to the outside world. 
I have a few suggestions, if you are 
interested. One, think about commis-
sioning a lobbying and electioneering 
audit of your own company. If you are 
the CEO, commission an audit of your 
own company’s lobbying and election-
eering so you actually know what your 
company is doing on climate. 
I suspect a lot of the CEOs signed 
this in good faith. They don’t know. So 
commission an audit. Learn what your 
company is really doing on climate. 
Do an audit of your trade associa-
tions. If you are a member of a trade 
association, get in there and see what 
they are up to. I bet that you will find 
that what I say is true. 
Three, demand that your trade asso-
ciations declare where they get their 
money. It seems obvious that the rea-
son that the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce and the National Association of 
Manufacturers became the two worst 
climate obstructers in America is be-
cause they were paid to. If you, CEOs 
on 
the 
Business 
Roundtable, 
had 
known that, this might not have hap-
pened. We might not have been here by 
now. 
It is very likely that the Chamber 
and the NAM leaders snuck up on you, 
taking floods of fossil fuel money that 
they didn’t tell you about and selling 
out their organizations to the fossil 
fuel industry, leaving you high and 
dry, having to explain why you are sup-
porting 
the 
two 
worst 
climate 
obstructers in America. 
So do your audit, and then give those 
trade associations a deadline to align 
with your policy or you will quit—you 
will quit on the deadline if they 
haven’t. Don’t let them slow-walk you 
through endless discussion and process 
while they are still loading up on fossil 
fuel money and running fossil fuel er-
rands in your names. Don’t let them do 
that. 
Finally—finally—recommendation 
five, ask your lawyers. Ask your law-
yers, particularly if you are on the 
board of climate obstructer groups: If 
these groups were trafficking in fraud-
ulent information, what is the board’s 
responsibility? That is a lawyer ques-
tion. 
If they loaded up with fossil fuel 
money, how was your due diligence on 
the board of that organization in de-
tecting that warning signal that your 
trade association had loaded up with 
fossil fuel money and was arguing 
against your position when it came to 
Congress, carrying the water for the 
fossil fuel industry? Your lawyers may 
have some advice about whether you 
have met due diligence. 
Final point, climate is not really a 
partisan issue. It wasn’t in 2007 to 2009, 
when Senator CARDIN and I got here 
and the Senate had multiple bipartisan 
climate bills. 
It wasn’t in 2008, when Republican 
John McCain had climate on his party 
platform as the Republican nominee. It 
all started with Citizens United in 2010, 
when the fossil fuel industry was al-
lowed to trade up its political weap-
onry from muskets, corporate PACs, to 
tactical nukes, unlimited spending, se-
cret super PACs, phony front groups— 
the whole apparatus of climate ob-
struction. 
Today, as a result of that, the Repub-
lican Party has been so captured that 
on climate it is little more than the po-
litical wing of the fossil fuel industry. 
It doesn’t have to be that way. 
To these big companies who signed 
this wonderful pledge: Fix your poli-
tics, push back on the fossil fuel ob-
struction, clean up your obstructor 
trade associations, wake up your sleep-
ers, and make climate a real priority in 
Congress, and you will see what looks 
like magic begin to happen. 
For you all, it is less time to wake up 
to climate change than it is time to 
wake up to your own political indiffer-
ence and presumably unknowing com-
plicity in the political logjam on cli-
mate action that the fossil fuel indus-
try has deliberately created here in 
Congress. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator WHITEHOUSE for his 
longstanding leadership in the U.S. 
Senate on addressing the concerns of 
climate change. He has been there 
every week, every day, leading us to 
take action to prevent the horrors of 
climate change. 
We have made some progress but not 
enough under his leadership. We have 
to do more, as he points out, and what 
he just told our colleagues. But I just 
really want to thank the Senator—as I 
look at the wildfires in the West, I look 
at the frequency of the hurricanes, 
when I look at the receding shorelines 
in Maryland, as I look at our efforts on 
the Chesapeake Bay—and recognize 
that if we don’t do what we need to do, 
what science tells us we could do on 
carbon emissions, we are doing this at 
our own peril. 
It is not just America. It is the global 
communities. It is our leadership glob-
ally. Senator WHITEHOUSE and I trav-
eled with other Members of the Senate 
to the climate meetings, and we made 
progress. We have to get back to it. I 
just want to thank Senator WHITE-
HOUSE for his leadership. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, on Sunday, the Wash-
ington National Cathedral marked the 
200,000 American lives lost to COVID–19 
by tolling the Bourdon Bell 200 times— 
once for every 1,000 lives lost. Nearly 
113,000 people have died since May 15, 
when the House of Representatives 
passed a comprehensive COVID–19 re-
lief package known as the Heroes Act. 
As of September 20, the 7-day moving 
average for new infections was over 
41,000. The 7-day moving average for 
new deaths was almost 800. Put another 
way, from a fatality standpoint, we 
have the equivalent of the 9/11 terrorist 
attack every 4 days. The United States, 
which has 4.3 percent of the world’s 
population, accounts for 21.1 percent of 
the COVID–19 deaths worldwide. 
When President Trump delivered his 
Inaugural Address in January 2017, he 
stated: 
This American carnage stops right here 
and stops right now. We are one nation. . . . 
We share one heart, one home, and one glo-
rious destiny. . . . So to all Americans in 
every city near and far, small and large, 
from mountain to mountain, from ocean to 
ocean, hear these words—you will never be 
ignored again. 
Fast forward to last week when 
President 
Trump—referring 
to 
the 
total U.S. fatalities—said: 
If you take the blue states out, we’re at a 
level that I don’t think anybody in the world 
would be at. We’re really at a very low level. 
Of course, talking about COVID in-
fection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5813 
September 23, 2020 
President Trump has said many ap-
palling things. Dividing America dur-
ing a pandemic into so-called blue and 
red States and devaluing the lives of 
Americans from blue States may be 
one of the most appalling things so far. 
As former Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity and Republican Governor of 
Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, remarked, 
‘‘It’s so unworthy of a president. It’s 
beyond despicable. It’s soulless. It’s al-
most unspeakable in the middle of the 
pandemic to try to divide the country 
on a political basis when COVID–19 is 
really bipartisan.’’ 
Not only was President Trump’s 
statement 
appalling, 
beyond 
des-
picable, and soulless, it belies the fact 
that COVID–19 does not care about 
State boundaries or any other bound-
aries. The States that President Trump 
lost in the 2016 election currently ac-
count for about 12,000 more COVID 
deaths than the States that he won. 
But the 11 States with the highest 
number of COVID–19 cases per million 
residents are all States that he won, 
and 14 of the 19 States with caseloads 
above the national average are States 
that he won. So the grim gap is clos-
ing, but it really should not matter be-
cause we are the United States of 
America. I wish President Trump could 
understand that. 
Speaker PELOSI has stated that she 
intends to keep the House in session 
until Congress passes another com-
prehensive COVID–19 relief package. 
And I agree with the Speaker. 
The Senate may adjourn as soon as it 
passes the fiscal year 2020 continuing 
resolution to keep the Federal Govern-
ment open. I fear this would be a grave 
mistake and an abdication of our duty. 
The Senate should take up the Heroes 
Act. The so-called skinny amendments 
Senators 
JOHNSON
and 
MCCONNELL 
brought to the floor over the past few 
weeks were so woefully inadequate 
they failed the fundamental test of 
serving as the beginning block for a bi-
partisan compromise. Even President 
Trump indicated the Senate Repub-
licans need to do more. 
I would like to take the next few 
minutes to outline some of the things 
we need do to respond appropriately to 
the twin health and economic crises 
our Nation faces. 
Remember when President Trump 
promised that the novel coronavirus 
would 
magically 
disappear 
as 
the 
weather got warmer? Well, that did not 
happen, and now summer has turned to 
autumn; the weather is starting to get 
cold again; and the flu season is ap-
proaching. 
The 
next 
COVID–19 
supplemental 
package should include provisions that 
increase the Federal Matching Assist-
ance Payment, FMAP, and maintain 
Medicaid payments and permanently 
expand 
telehealth 
flexibilities 
that 
have increased healthcare access to pa-
tients around the country and address 
health disparities that COVID–19 pan-
demic has worsened. 
The Urban Institute estimates 12 mil-
lion additional Americans will turn to 
Medicaid 
for 
access 
to 
affordable 
healthcare amid the pandemic. In my 
State, more than 45,000 Marylanders 
are newly enrolled in Medicaid. At the 
same time, State revenues are plum-
meting, leaving States facing budget 
deficits that could amount to $555 bil-
lion through 2022. 
If unaddressed, these budget short-
falls will lead States to making dra-
matic cuts to Medicaid, just as they 
did during the past economic down-
turns, at a time when those newly and 
previously enrolled need healthcare the 
most. The National Governors Associa-
tion has called on Congress to further 
raise the FMAP and maintain access to 
essential Medicaid benefits. 
Another important policy that will 
increase access to healthcare services 
during the COVID–19 pandemic is per-
manently extending telehealth permis-
sions and privileges implemented under 
the CARES Act. Specifically, Congress 
should permanently remove regulatory 
barriers so that patients in rural, un-
derserved, and urban areas can use 
telehealth to see their primary care 
providers, mental health counselors, 
and 
chronic 
disease 
management 
teams. Reimbursement for these serv-
ices should adequately reflect the care 
delivered and allow patients to use 
their homes to receive these services. 
Telehealth increases access to care in 
areas with workforce shortages and for 
individuals who live far away from 
healthcare facilities, have limited mo-
bility or transportation, or have other 
barriers to accessing care. 
This is a bipartisan proposal to ex-
pand telehealth. It makes abundant 
sense. We have done it. Now let’s make 
it permanent. That helps rural Amer-
ica; that helps people who have a hard 
time with transportation to get to 
where they need to be; it is more effi-
cient; and it is safer. Let’s make sure 
that is done before we leave. 
At a time when many are unable to 
visit their health provider in person, 
we must depend on telehealth to de-
liver high-quality healthcare to mil-
lions of Americans around the country. 
We have seen how COVID–19 has dis-
proportionately affected communities 
of color, highlighting how the United 
States fails to extend critical re-
sources, support, and healthcare access 
to these communities. According to the 
data from the CDC, communities of 
color experience higher rates of hos-
pitalization and death from COVID–19 
than White people do. Black Ameri-
cans, Native Americans, Alaskan Na-
tives are five times more likely to be 
hospitalized than White people are. 
African-American Marylanders ac-
count for 30 percent of our State’s pop-
ulation but 41 percent of its COVID fa-
talities. Marylanders of Latin Amer-
ican descent account for 17 percent of 
the State’s population but 21 percent of 
its cases. 
This is why the next supplemental 
package must focus on and contain 
policies that address health disparities 
that 
have 
been 
worsened 
by 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
I have authored two bills focused on 
addressing health disparities: One, the 
REACH Act, with Senator SCOTT of 
South Carolina; and, two, the COVID– 
19 Health Disparities Action Act with 
Senator MENENDEZ. Both bills create 
targeted grant programs that would 
help community-based organizations 
and local health departments provide 
culturally appropriate outreach, edu-
cation, and health services to Black, 
Latino, indigenous, and our commu-
nities of color. Both bills are important 
steps to rectifying the ills of systemic 
racism from going forward. 
Communities of color have long-
standing and tragically appropriate 
mistrust with the medical community, 
for good reason, sadly. Our government 
deliberately misled Black patients and 
research 
participants 
during 
the 
Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Today, phy-
sicians 
still 
undertreat 
or 
under-
diagnose pain in patients of color. The 
REACH Act and the COVID–19 Health 
Disparities Action Act should be in-
cluded in the next COVID–19 supple-
mental to help promote trust within 
the communities of color for future 
COVID–19 responses, as we look beyond 
the pandemic. 
Since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, our State and local govern-
ments have faced significant financial 
challenges to meet declining revenues, 
as well as emergency costs related to 
COVID–19. It is well beyond time we 
listen to those on the ground dealing 
with the COVID–19 pandemic and pro-
vide them the resources they need. 
What does this mean for commu-
nities back home? For our municipali-
ties, it is funding for first responders 
and community services. For our coun-
ties, it is funding for schools. For our 
States, it is funding for public health. 
The revenue losses our State, county, 
and local governments face are dra-
matic, and they threaten to cause deep, 
lasting cuts to public safety, edu-
cation, public health, and other critical 
essential services that will adversely 
affect far beyond the public health bat-
tle against COVID–19. 
Our Governors have issued a bipar-
tisan plea. Governor Cuomo of New 
York, a Democrat, and Governor Hogan 
of Maryland, a Republican, who are the 
chair and previous chair of the Na-
tional Governors Association, respec-
tively, joined with all of our Nation’s 
Governors—all—in April to say they 
need help from the Federal Govern-
ment. 
They need help to maintain critical 
missions 
of 
public 
safety, 
public 
health, and public education with at 
least $500 billion for our States and ad-
ditional funding for local governments 
beyond what we already provided under 
the CARES Act. 
The Heroes Act, which has passed the 
House, provides $875 billion for our 
State and local governments. Of that 
amount, $500 billion goes to meet the 
State’s needs, and $375 billion goes to 
meet local government needs, with 
one-half to the counties and one-half to

municipalities. This funding goes di-
rectly to counties and local govern-
ments of all sizes to support their ur-
gent needs. The funding is meant to ad-
dress urgent COVID–19 response activi-
ties, and State and local governments 
may also use it to replace lost revenue 
to avoid making draconian cuts to es-
sential services. 
That would go a long way to meeting 
the needs of our local first responders, 
our police, our firefighters, our sanita-
tion workers, and our educators. 
The Senate Republicans’ HEALS Act, 
in its most recent iteration, provides 
no new funding to help State and local 
governments; rather, they merely ex-
tend the deadline for use using CARES 
moneys. That is not adequate. We must 
do more. 
This is too little, too late. Our State 
and local communities in Maryland 
have already allocated funding for pro-
grams that support renters, small busi-
nesses, and support frontline workers 
who face increased risk of exposure to 
COVID–19. Those dollars are spoken 
for. 
I urge my colleagues to recognize the 
lasting harm the failure to support our 
State and local governments will cause 
and support the NGA’s bipartisan re-
quest to provide additional funding to 
State and local governments. 
If we learned anything when the 
school year ended so abruptly this past 
spring, it is a greater appreciation for 
our educators and the work they pro-
vide for our students in the classroom. 
It is so difficult to duplicate the inter-
action between educators and students, 
yet our colleagues across the aisle ap-
pear to be unwilling to provide our 
local school systems with the resources 
they need to allow school systems to 
educate students safely this fall. 
Our local school leaders are making 
incredibly difficult decisions while fac-
ing political pressures from the Trump 
administration to ignore public health 
recommendations from Federal, State, 
and local officials; legitimate concerns 
from educators on the safety of return-
ing to the classroom; and questions 
from parents who need answers on how 
to continue their child’s education 
while meeting their own work respon-
sibilities. 
With dwindling State and local gov-
ernment revenues because of COVID–19, 
the school leaders have already started 
to 
face 
budget 
crunches 
even 
as 
schools’ financial needs have increased 
things like cleaning supplies now nec-
essary to meet CDC public health guid-
ance, 
educational 
technology, 
and 
trainings for educators to meet the 
new demands of online education. 
Without 
additional 
Federal 
re-
sources, we fail to provide our local 
school leaders with the tools necessary 
to strike the balance between main-
taining the highest quality level of 
education for our children while pro-
tecting student and educator health. 
The Heroes Act provides $100 billion 
for a State-level Fiscal Stabilization 
Fund for education, with $90 billion for 
States to support their public institu-
tions of education. In Maryland, this 
would provide nearly $900 million for 
our local school districts for meeting 
the needs of growing numbers of low- 
income students and our children with 
special needs; retaining educators vital 
to the education of our children; and 
ensuring that schools have resources to 
improve the virtual learning environ-
ment that frustrated so many students, 
parents, and educators last spring. 
This funding would rightly support 
the decisions of local school and public 
health officials on how schools may re-
open in the fall, whether virtual or in- 
person or hybrid. It does not attempt 
to coerce school districts into reopen-
ing their classroom doors in an unsafe 
manner as the only way to receive 
critically necessary Federal funds. 
The Federal Government should pro-
vide local leaders with adequate re-
sources to support well-informed and 
reasoned public health decisions rather 
than dangerously mandating school re-
openings. In addition, the Federal Gov-
ernment needs to take the leadership 
in eliminating the digital divide. Ac-
cess to reliable internet service should 
be available to every household in 
America. 
The best action Congress can take to 
help small businesses is to provide 
State and local governments, health 
providers, and first responders with the 
resources they need to protect our 
communities from COVID–19, as I men-
tioned a moment ago. I am proud to be 
the ranking Democrat on the Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship Com-
mittee. I have worked very closely 
with Senator RUBIO on proposals. First, 
we have to get this COVID–19 under 
control. Only after it is safe for small 
businesses to resume full operations 
and safe for parents to send their chil-
dren to school will our economy truly 
begin to recover. 
Getting the virus under control is es-
pecially important for small businesses 
in the food services, hospitality, live 
events, travel and tourism sectors. 
Businesses in those sectors are espe-
cially reliant on large gatherings in 
order to make a profit. 
Restaurants, for example, have been 
able to make up for lost indoor dining 
capacity by increasing their outdoor 
dining capacity, which will become in-
creasingly difficult in many parts of 
the country as the weather gets colder 
and more inclement. 
Similarly, communities that rely on 
tourism revenues generated during the 
winter months, such as Deep Creek 
Lake in my home State of Maryland, 
are likely to experience decreased 
cashflow this year due to the pan-
demic. Employers on the Eastern Shore 
missed their prime summer months. 
Congress cannot leave small businesses 
and the communities that rely on them 
out in the cold. 
In addition to getting the pandemic 
under control, Congress must build on 
the lessons learned during past eco-
nomic downturns. The most important 
lesson is that there is no one-size-fits- 
all solution to rescue the economy dur-
ing a crisis. To help the most employ-
ers we can, Congress must preserve the 
multiple support tools in the toolkit. 
There is already bipartisan consensus 
that we must provide small businesses 
with a second Paycheck Protection 
Program loan. More than 3 months 
ago, Senators COONS, SHAHEEN, and I 
introduced legislation to create the 
Prioritized Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, which would provide vulnerable 
small businesses experiencing signifi-
cant losses due to COVID–19 with a sec-
ond capital infusion. Our proposal— 
P4—would allow small businesses that 
have 100 or fewer employees to receive 
a second PPP loan if they can dem-
onstrate a loss of revenue of 50 percent 
or more due to the pandemic. The bill 
would also reserve $25 billion for small 
businesses with 10 or fewer employees 
and extend the deadline to apply for an 
initial PPP loan through the end of 
this year. 
There is also bipartisan agreement 
on the need to improve the Economic 
Injury Disaster Loan Program, EIDL. I 
support Senator ROSEN’s and Senator 
WARREN’s efforts to shore up the EIDL 
Program so that more small businesses 
have access to the long-term, low-in-
terest rate loans the program makes 
available. With their maximum loan 
amount of $2 million and repayment 
terms as long as 30 years, EIDLs pro-
vide small businesses with flexibility, 
capital that they can use to retool 
their businesses to respond to COVID– 
19. 
There is also bipartisan agreement 
on the need to expand the employee re-
tention tax credit, which is a provision 
from legislation I introduced with Sen-
ator WYDEN that was included in the 
CARES Act. The House acted on this 
bipartisan agreement. The Heroes Act 
makes substantial enhancements to 
this program so that it could benefit 
close to 60 million workers and over 6 
million businesses. 
If the Senate fails to act now—before 
adjourning—to 
support 
small 
busi-
nesses by getting this pandemic under 
control and providing capital to our 
small businesses, our communities will 
pay a heavy price for that inaction, as 
many more small businesses will close 
their doors, and I am afraid they will 
do it permanently. 
Studies have shown that maintaining 
the employer-employee relationship is 
key to a swift, robust recovery. With 
tens of millions of Americans relying 
on unemployment benefits and perma-
nent job losses on the rise, it is critical 
that we do all we can to keep workers 
connected to their jobs and prevent 
further layoffs. I am disappointed that, 
despite bipartisan agreement on sev-
eral of the measures needed to support 
American small businesses struggling 
to survive COVID–19, the response to 
the pandemic has turned into a par-
tisan fight. 
For the sake of our communities and 
small businesses, I urge my Republican

colleagues and President Trump to ac-
cept Speaker PELOSI and Senator SCHU-
MER’s offer to meet Democrats in the 
middle so we can pass a bipartisan bill 
that helps our communities get COVID 
under control and begin the recovery 
process. 
The Heroes Act also extends the 
weekly $600 emergency Federal unem-
ployment payment. This special ben-
efit lapsed in July. President Trump’s 
program to provide $300 a week in 
emergency benefits through FEMA is a 
weak half measure, and Congress must 
do more. These extra 6 weeks will ex-
pire very shortly, and it comes out of 
the FEMA funds, which are desperately 
needed as we know how many emer-
gencies are occurring throughout our 
country with the wildfires and the hur-
ricanes. 
The full benefits the Heroes Act pro-
vides would strengthen the critical 
safety net for the record number of 
Americans who are unemployed as 
America faces its most serious eco-
nomic challenge since the Great De-
pression. 
By way of example in Maryland, we 
are seeing first-time claims for unem-
ployment benefits at a rate of about 
13,000 a week, peaking in early May, 
with nearly 110,000 new weekly claims 
filed. We have seen the total number of 
filings since March exceed 1.5 million. 
These are numbers that cry out for us 
to extend the unemployment benefits. 
We really need to do that, and we need 
to do that before we leave. 
These are some, but not all, of the 
issues we must address immediately 
and for a sustained period. Former 
President Harry Truman had a sign on 
his desk in the Oval Office that said: 
‘‘The buck stops here.’’ ‘‘Passing the 
buck’’ means something entirely dif-
ferent to President Trump. On March 
13, 2020, as we began to grasp the mag-
nitude and impacts of the coronavirus, 
President Trump said: ‘‘I don’t take re-
sponsibility at all.’’ That may be the 
most honest and accurate thing he has 
said since he has become President. We 
have ample evidence to take him seri-
ously. Therefore, it is up to Congress to 
provide the leadership and relief Amer-
icans desperately need. 
The House has done its part in pass-
ing the Heroes Act. It is now time for 
the Senate to act. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, here 
we are again. It is late September, and 
the budget work has not been com-
pleted yet. It seems terribly familiar to 
this body, and it is frustrating. It is 
not as if no one knew September was 
coming; it was on the calendar. When I 
first looked at it in January this year, 
September already existed on the cal-
endar. 
It is not as if we didn’t know what all 
the deadlines were. Everyone knew full 
well what all the deadlines were. 
We can say it is the pandemic that 
slowed everything down, except for the 
fact that all of the appropriations work 
could have already been done, and 
much of the committee work could 
have been done. Some was done by the 
House but not completed. It can be 
done by the Senate, but it was not. 
So here we are again, watching the 
countdown clock toward a government 
shutdown as we discuss what happens 
next. 
Things have been tied up this week 
with what is called a continuing reso-
lution. This body knows—others may 
not—that a continuing resolution is 
literally taking last year’s appropria-
tions bills, changing the dates, and 
moving them over to the new one. This 
particular 
continuing 
resolution 
stretches until December 11, when we 
would have to pick it up and pass more 
appropriations for another continuing 
resolution at that time. 
The fight this week has been over 
whether we are going to support rural 
America and agriculture. The House 
originally drafted a continuing resolu-
tion that left out all of the agriculture 
projects that were in it. The Senate, 
obviously, threw a fit over that and 
asked: Why are we supporting every-
thing, including benefits to Sri Lanka 
to get added to the House’s proposal for 
the continuing resolution, but you 
won’t do so for America’s farmers? 
So, in the back-and-forth conversa-
tion this week, the House had to ex-
tend. Then it went another day. Then 
the House finally put the agriculture 
projects back in—and still left in, by 
the way, benefit for Sri Lanka. 
Our ongoing conversations continue, 
though, about airlines. On October 1, 
airlines across the country are going to 
lay off 100,000 people—100,000. We have 
asked for some engagement on the 
issue of these airlines. In the CARES 
Act, back in March, we gave an exten-
sion to those airline workers so that 
the airline workers and the airlines 
could still stay connected to each other 
even when we were in this downtime. 
We are getting very close to a vaccine. 
It is like we can see the light on the 
other end of the tunnel, but it is not a 
train this time; it is actually light. We 
are going to get through this pan-
demic, but for whatever reason, the 
House refuses to deal with the issue of 
how to help airline workers at all, not 
even to do half of what was done in the 
past, not even to do a portion of what 
was done in the CARES Act. It has 
been exceptionally frustrating. 
It has been the same issue with the 
House in its not wanting to do any-
thing on the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. For the smallest businesses in 
America and for nonprofits, the House 
has put out a multitrillion-dollar pro-
posal, and it doesn’t even include any-
thing for small businesses. 
We have continued to ask how we can 
address the issue of small businesses 
here. How can we extend the Paycheck 
Protection Program and give a second 
round to the hardest hit businesses? We 
don’t think it is that unreasonable. As 
we are nearing the end, we need to help 
them bridge the gap at this point, but 
for whatever reason, it is not included 
either as we work our way through this 
process. 
Now, I don’t know what will happen 
in the next few hours as we deal with 
the continuing resolution that will 
come from the House, but there is no 
reason we should be talking about a 
government shutdown again. 
A year ago, I and Senator HASSAN, 
the Democratic Senator from New 
Hampshire, sat down to talk through 
how we could end government shut-
downs forever so that government 
workers across the DC region and 
across the country would not be living 
in fear of being furloughed and so that 
Americans who would want to be able 
to connect with different agencies 
would be able to do that at all times, 
but we would still be able to have the 
arguments that are needed to be able 
to resolve budget issues. 
It may be surprising to some people 
across the country that Republicans 
and Democrats don’t agree on every-
thing in the budget. Shocking, I know. 
We should be able to have that fight, 
though, on the budget, but it should 
not lead to a government shutdown in 
the process. Government shutdowns 
cost us money every time it happens. 
So my and Senator HASSAN’s simple 
resolution resolves the issue by just 
asking one question: Who needs pres-
sure applied to them to deal with the 
issue, and what is the pressure that 
needs to be applied? 
Our straightforward answer is this: 
Members of Congress and our staffs and 
the Office of Management and Budget 
and the White House should have the 
pressure applied to us to get it done. 
The easiest way to apply pressure to 
all of us is to take away our time. It is 
pretty straightforward. 
Here is our proposal: If you get to the 
end of the budget year and the appro-
priations work is not done, we will 
have mandatory quorum calls in this 
body at 12 noon every single day, 7 days 
a week, until we get all of the appro-
priations work done. None of us could 
travel. We would all stay here in DC. 
I will tell you that I really want to 
see my family on the weekends. I also 
have people back in my State with 
whom I have appointments whom I 
need to be able to see, and I have re-
sponsibilities there. I want to get back 
to my State of Oklahoma and be with 
those folks. 
I am sure all of you would love to get 
back to Oklahoma, but you would prob-
ably head back to your States instead. 
We want to be home. We want to be 
able to meet with our constituents. We 
want to take care of the practical 
needs that are there. The way to do 
that is to get our work done here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5816 
September 23, 2020 
I have had folks say: Well, just take 
away everyone’s money. Say, ‘‘No 
budget, no pay.’’ It makes a great 
bumper sticker. The problem is, as 
many people in this body know, there 
are a lot of folks in this body who are 
multimillionaires, and if they were 
honest, they would say their congres-
sional salaries are rounding errors to 
their investments every month. 
Good for you, but it is not a pressure 
point. Taking away your congressional 
salary is not an emphasis to actually 
get the work done. 
Taking away time is a way to be able 
to press people to actually get their 
work done. 
Senator HASSAN and I have worked it 
through the committee process; have 
passed it through the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee; and have set it up. It 
has already been rule XIV’d, and it is 
on our Calendar now. At any moment, 
we in this body could determine to end 
government shutdowns. We will never 
have one again. If we get to the end of 
the fiscal year, a continuing resolution 
will kick in automatically, and we will 
all stay until we finish the negotia-
tions for the appropriations work. 
However heated, however long that 
may take, we will stay and finish it 
until it is done. 
It is the right thing for us to do, and 
it is the right way to handle it. It is 
not pressure on the Federal workers. 
The Federal workers don’t have the 
ability to make the decision here. 
Some people say: Well, those folks in 
DC can just tough it out anyway. 
Well, it is not just those folks in DC, 
though there are a lot of folks in DC 
who are working very hard for Ameri-
cans all over the country. Just in my 
State of Oklahoma, there are 4,300 Fed-
eral employees who work in agri-
culture, who work for Housing and 
Urban Development, who work for the 
FAA—who work for all kinds of enti-
ties that take care of families in Okla-
homa. They also deserve the privilege 
of continuing their service to their 
neighbors, just as always, while we are 
resolving our differences here. 
So my request is the same as it was 
last year: Why are we talking about 
the possibility of there being a govern-
ment shutdown again when we could 
take that off the table forever with a 
straightforward, 
bipartisan 
proposal 
that says we will never again have a 
government shutdown? 
We will work out our differences be-
cause we do have differences, but we 
will not hold Federal workers hostage 
in the process. We will just stay and 
work out our differences. 
I look forward to seeing the vote on 
the continuing resolution and avoiding 
a shutdown again, but I look much 
more forward to never having shut-
downs again when Senator HASSAN’s 
and my bill is finally voted on and 
passed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Nevada. 
REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I stand 
here to honor the life and legacy of Su-
preme Court Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg. 
In everything Justice Ginsburg did— 
from her pivotal role in the fight for 
gender equality, to her storied legal ca-
reer, to her serving on the DC Court of 
Appeals and, ultimately, as a member 
of the U.S. Supreme Court—throughout 
her life’s journey, she used every ounce 
of her ability to give voice to the 
voiceless and build a more just and eq-
uitable world. 
Justice Ginsburg was a lion on the 
bench. She ruled on monumental and 
historic cases, and the decisions she 
made—and 
even 
the 
dissents 
she 
wrote—have shaped this country and 
set us on a better path. 
This 
remarkable 
woman 
inspired 
countless Americans to fight for the 
best of us even when it was hard, even 
when it was inconvenient. I know I 
wouldn’t be here without Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg’s leading the way. We have a 
responsibility to honor her legacy, her 
work, and the ethos of Justice Gins-
burg. Part of her legacy was her deci-
sion to uphold the constitutionality of 
the Affordable Care Act, and we have 
seen too many attempts to dismantle 
this key cornerstone of her legacy. 
In my time as Senator, I have met 
countless Nevadans, and I have had the 
chance to speak with Americans from 
all across the country. I can say with 
certainty that there is no issue that 
matters more to the American people 
than their health, especially now. 
This administration has worked since 
day one to take healthcare coverage 
and critical protections away from mil-
lions of Americans. It has failed time 
and 
again 
to 
dismantle 
the 
ACA 
through legislation, and it has also at-
tempted to destroy and dismantle the 
ACA through the courts. 
In one of my first actions as a Sen-
ator, I co-led and helped to introduce a 
resolution to defend the Affordable 
Care Act’s constitutionality against 
this administration’s assault. In my 
first speech on the Senate floor, I 
called on the Senate to take it up and 
pass it. I cannot even begin to count 
the number of Nevadans who have 
shared how they would be affected by 
the ACA’s demise. Everything is at 
stake if these individuals and these 
families are denied access to care. 
Justice Ginsburg’s replacement will 
help to decide whether individuals with 
preexisting conditions can be denied 
coverage and, thus, be left behind. Let 
me be clear: What this potentially 
means is that any of us with a pre-
existing condition could no longer ob-
tain health insurance. 
This next Justice will decide if we see 
an end to the tax credits that make 
healthcare coverage affordable for mid-
dle-income families. 
This next Justice will decide if we see 
an end to preventive care without 
copays. 
This next Justice will decide if we see 
an end to the ability of young adults, 
until the age of 26, to stay on their par-
ents’ insurance. 
This next Justice will decide if we see 
an end to expanded Medicaid benefits, 
which have helped over 200,000 Nevad-
ans get coverage. 
This next Justice is going to decide 
who has healthcare during an unprece-
dented and deadly pandemic that has 
already, tragically, taken the lives of 
over 200,000 Americans. 
This next Justice will also decide if 
the nearly 7 million Americans who 
have already tested positive for COVID 
can be denied healthcare coverage be-
cause they contracted a disease that 
this administration initially ignored 
and has been unable or unwilling to 
combat with a national plan. 
So much hangs in the balance for the 
American people. Millions could lose 
healthcare because of this Supreme 
Court pick. We could go back to a 
world in which people with preexisting 
conditions could not afford to pay for 
lifesaving 
medicine 
or 
treatment. 
Using the courts to take away the 
American people’s healthcare, espe-
cially at this moment in our Nation’s 
history, is not only cruel—it is dan-
gerous. 
Amid a global pandemic and the 
worst economy in generations, our top 
priority right now should be the needs 
of the American people—the relief and 
care that matches the urgency of this 
crisis. We cannot afford to play polit-
ical games or to threaten the American 
people’s health coverage when they 
need it the most. The American people 
deserve better. They deserve the sta-
bility and security of healthcare cov-
erage for themselves and their loved 
ones. 
I ask that my colleagues truly listen 
to the American people, who need us 
now more than ever. 
I had hoped that my Republican col-
leagues would have honored their own 
precedent in this process—the McCon-
nell rule—and ensured that the Amer-
ican people would have their say at the 
ballot box before filling any vacancy. 
Instead of political gamesmanship, I 
ask that my colleagues honor the dig-
nity of our democratic institutions and 
the health of the American people. 
In 2015, when asked how she would 
like to be remembered, Justice Gins-
burg responded: ‘‘As someone who . . . 
[helped] repair tears in her society, to 
make things a little better through the 
use of whatever ability she has.’’ 
That is how she wanted to be remem-
bered. 
We, too, have the ability to repair 
tears in our democracy, and we, too, 
have the ability to make sure things 
are better for all Americans by ensur-
ing that their health remains pro-
tected. 
I urge my colleagues to follow Jus-
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s example 
and honor her life and her life’s work. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5817 
September 23, 2020 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
on the floor today to talk about what 
the Senate and the House ought to be 
doing before we leave town for the elec-
tion, and that is helping people who are 
in need because of the impact of the 
coronavirus. 
I know this is the week when we are 
focused on the passing of Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, and that is appro-
priate. There is a lot of discussion also 
about filling her seat. 
We should, of course, all take time to 
mourn our Nation’s loss, but we are 
also in the middle of an unprecedented 
healthcare and economic crisis. I think 
we have a responsibility to continue 
working on COVID–19 legislation to re-
spond to those challenges. 
Since this crisis began, Congress has 
actually come together repeatedly, as 
Republicans and Democrats, House and 
Senate, and working with the White 
House, to pass five coronavirus relief 
bills—legislation to address both the 
healthcare crisis and the economic free 
fall that was caused by the virus and 
the shutdowns. The biggest of these 
bills was the one you hear about the 
most—the roughly $2 trillion CARES 
Act that was passed by a vote of 96 to 
0. 
Again, these have been bipartisan ef-
forts up until now. Unfortunately, 
since May, when the last of these five 
bills was enacted, partisanship has pre-
vailed over good policy, and Wash-
ington has been paralyzed, unable to 
come together for the public good. 
Last week I came to the floor to 
highlight how this dynamic has played 
out with regard to a single issue that 
has become strictly important for so 
many people in my home State of Ohio 
and around the country. That is the ex-
panded Federal unemployment insur-
ance 
supplement 
included 
in 
the 
CARES Act back in March. 
I had a tele-townhall last night. I am 
trying to do a tele-townhall or a 
Facebook Live townhall every week 
during the pandemic, in part just to 
stay in touch with people because it is 
so hard back home now to visit with 
people in person. Again last night, I 
had two callers call in, both of whom 
are taking advantage of the current 
$300-per-week Federal supplement pro-
vided really by the Trump administra-
tion, and they talked to me about how 
they are going to plan for the future. 
These are individuals who don’t have 
a job to go back to. One, by the way, is 
a musician who makes his living play-
ing music—the piano and singing and 
so on—at long-term care facilities, 
nursing homes, and each one of his pre-
vious clients has said that he is not 
welcome to come back now, for good 
reason. But that makes his life pretty 
tough because that is what he does for 
a living. 
So his question to me was this: You 
know, look, I really appreciate the 300 
bucks. I need it to get by. And I got my 
rent, I got my car payment, and what 
are you guys going to do about that? 
Well, the truth is, nothing at this 
point, and that is too bad because that 
$300 supplement has now ended. In ef-
fect, what the President did to con-
tinue some help at the Federal level 
had limits because he did it under the 
only choice he had, really, which was 
the Disaster Relief Fund, and that has 
now run out. So that is where we are. 
Early on in the pandemic, both Re-
publicans and Democrats recognized 
the need to bolster the State-run un-
employment insurance programs to 
help offset the massive job losses we 
saw in March and April. The initial 
amount was $600 per week, and it was 
provided by the CARES Act. It came at 
a big cost to taxpayers. It also provided 
an income source that made the dif-
ference for a lot of folks in the State of 
Ohio and around the country. 
During those early months, you re-
member the government was actually 
shutting down a lot of businesses, and 
workers were losing their jobs through 
no fault of their own, like this indi-
vidual last night—through no fault of 
his own not having a job. 
As the year has gone on, we have 
made progress. We slowed the spread of 
the coronavirus in most States. We 
have added more testing and personal 
protective gear. More and more parts 
of our economy have been able to re-
open in a safe and sustainable manner, 
and that is great. With the reopening, 
hiring has picked back up, and we now 
have far fewer people on unemploy-
ment insurance than we did at the be-
ginning of this pandemic. 
Unemployment is now about 8.4 per-
cent. That was the number for Au-
gust—down from over 15 percent back 
in the spring. That is a big change. 
Over 4 million jobs have been added. At 
the same time, 8.4 percent is still 
high—very high. Remember, we were at 
about 3.5 percent in February of this 
year. 
By the way, February was the 19th 
straight month of wage increases of 
over 3 percent. We had record-low un-
employment for many sectors of our 
economy, and here we are at 8.4 per-
cent. So we are not out of the woods 
yet. We still have a way to go. Ohio’s 
unemployment number just came out 
the day before yesterday. For August, 
it was 8.9 percent. So 10 percent unem-
ployment is something we are now 
under. In fact, we are under 9 percent, 
which is way, way faster than the pro-
jections. But still, 8.9 percent unem-
ployment in Ohio is something that we 
need to focus on. 
I will say that overall, we are going 
in the right direction and that unem-
ployment claims, I think, are now ei-
ther steadily dropping or holding level 
in almost every State. That is cer-
tainly true in Ohio. 
So it is fair that Congress wanted to 
take another look at that original un-
employment 
insurance 
supplement, 
which was set to expire at the begin-
ning of August, and it did expire, and 
we wanted to look at it to see what the 
new supplement ought to be given the 
changing economy and given some of 
the improvements that we saw and also 
given the need for more workers as 
more businesses were reopening. 
Now, $600 per week was a relatively 
generous benefit—to the point that the 
Congressional Budget Office, the non-
partisan group around here that gives 
us advice, said: If you kept that $600 
until next year—which is what the 
Democrats proposed in their Heroes 
Act—8 out of 10 people getting 600 
bucks a week would be paid more on 
unemployment insurance than they 
would be at their jobs. 
In other words, you would be making 
more money unemployed than you 
would if you were working. That is not 
the way unemployment insurance is 
supposed to work. That is not good for 
an economy that is trying to reopen. 
I have been all over my State and 
talked to employers—small, mid, large- 
size employers. I have talked to the 
nonprofits. I have talked to people who 
are working hard to try to provide care 
to people in the healthcare sector. 
They all tell me the same thing: That 
$600 is a problem because some people 
were not coming back to work because, 
again, for most of those people, they 
could make more on unemployment 
than they could working. So we needed 
to adjust it. Yet Democrats insisted 600 
or nothing—or nothing—and so we got 
nothing. 
Some of us had proposed $300. In that 
case, some people would be getting 
paid more on unemployment, but most 
would not. In fact, most of them would 
be getting less than some percentage of 
their salaries. But, again, if you lose 
your job through no fault of your own, 
particularly because of a government 
decision to shut down your sector—say 
a movie theater or a bowling alley or a 
bar—it seems to me that we ought to 
be helping. 
So the $300 that we proposed was to 
go until toward the end of the year, but 
Democrats said no—kind of a ‘‘my way 
or the highway’’ approach, like it is 
going to be $600 or we are going to give 
these people nothing. We gave people 
nothing. To me, that was a big mis-
take. 
A number of us came to the floor and 
actually said: Let’s continue $600 for a 
week so we can negotiate something. 
Democrats said: No. We want to end 
it. We don’t even want to have it tem-
porarily at $600 to be able to negotiate 
something between Republicans and 
Democrats. 
That is too bad. 
When Congress failed to act, Presi-
dent Trump and his administration 
stepped in, and they said: $300 is about 
the right number. We will provide the 
States a $300 supplement through what 
is called the Disaster Relief Fund.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5818 
September 23, 2020 
Now, in the CARES legislation we 
talked about earlier, which was the $2 
trillion legislation that passed 96 to 0 
around here, a lot of money went out 
for various causes—for our hospitals, 
for our schools, and for our families 
through unemployment insurance. But 
it also provided some funding for what 
is called the Disaster Relief Fund for 
COVID–19 purposes. So the President 
took some of that money for COVID–19 
purposes out of the Disaster Relief 
Fund and said: We are going to, for 6 
weeks, allow the States to use this $300 
supplement if they choose to do so. 
They also encouraged the States to 
provide their own match. What hap-
pened was, every State but two took 
the government up on that. So the vast 
majority of States said: Yes, we will do 
it. 
They didn’t add their match, by the 
way, but they did take the 300 bucks, 
and a lot of people have been helped by 
that because over the past 6 weeks, 
that funding has been available. Unfor-
tunately, sometimes it got paid as a 
lump sum because by the time the 
State systems figured out how to ad-
minister it, you know, we were close to 
the end of the 6 weeks. But people 
knew that was coming. They knew 
they had 300 bucks for paying their 
rent, paying their car payment, paying 
their mortgage, and that was helpful. 
That was helpful. 
Now we are at a point where Presi-
dent Trump’s emergency Lost Wages 
Assistance Program, which is what 
that was called—the Lost Wages As-
sistance Program under the Disaster 
Relief Fund—has tapped out. Forty- 
four billion dollars was made available 
to the States, leaving $25 billion in 
that Disaster Relief Fund because that 
$25 billion was what was projected to 
be necessary to deal with the natural 
disasters. 
So that is where we are today. Forty- 
four billion has been depleted. People 
who have had unemployment insurance 
since this disaster began are not going 
to have it now. It is going to end. For 
many people, it ended this week; for 
some, next week; for some, the week 
before. 
The point is, we as a Congress need 
to act. My view is, let’s provide some 
more funding for the Disaster Relief 
Fund, at least. If we can’t come to-
gether with a big COVID–19 package 
that helps the schools, that helps small 
businesses with the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, which I support extend-
ing, that helps with regard to getting 
more money for testing and getting our 
vaccine more quickly and getting the 
therapies up, let’s at least provide the 
administration with some funding in 
the Disaster Relief Fund so they can 
continue to respond to need. 
Let’s also provide them that funding 
because they need it for natural disas-
ters. What do I mean by that? Well, the 
other thing that has happened in the 
last 6 weeks, as you probably noticed, 
is that we have had a lot of natural dis-
asters in the West with fires and in the 
South with hurricanes. So that funding 
left in the Disaster Relief Fund ought 
to be supplemented for that purpose as 
well. 
This is a temporary program meant 
to provide a bridge while Congress acts. 
And it would be great if Congress were 
to act, but, frankly, I am getting kind 
of discouraged about Congress’s ability 
to come together again on a bipartisan 
basis, as much as I wish we would. 
I have spoken on the floor about 
what I think I can see as the points of 
compromise and the overlap between 
our two approaches because there is a 
lot of it. Every single Republican save 
1, 52 Members—a majority of the Sen-
ate—voted for a proposal a couple 
weeks ago that was viewed as a tar-
geted proposal that did provide help for 
COVID–19 for families, for small busi-
nesses, and for healthcare. 
Democrats had their own idea, which 
is the $3.5 trillion that they wanted. 
Ours was about $500 billion. There is 
something in between there. We could 
come together with something that is 
sensible, but it looks like that is un-
likely. 
So at a minimum, let’s move forward 
with these unemployment insurance 
supplements that we have been doing. 
Let’s give the administration the abil-
ity to do it again through the Disaster 
Relief Fund. This funding shortage 
would be easy for us to put into the 
legislation that is likely to come be-
fore this Chamber in the next 24 hours, 
which is the continuing resolution. 
That is the funding that is going to pay 
for government to continue operating. 
You know, Congress is supposed to 
pass individual appropriations bills. 
There are 12 of them. We didn’t do 
them this year because of the partisan 
gridlock around here, so once again we 
are turning to a continuing resolution 
to provide the funding going forward. 
The House is acting this week, and 
we are going to act this week or early 
next week, as I understand it. It would 
be the perfect place to put more fund-
ing into this Disaster Relief Fund for 
us to be able to provide that $300 ben-
efit that the administration has been 
providing to all States but two and to 
also provide for more help for the nat-
ural disasters that are upon us. 
Senator THOM TILLIS and I have pro-
posed legislation to do just that. We 
have a bill out there that we hope Con-
gress will be willing to pass, and we are 
also interested in adding it as an 
amendment to the continuing resolu-
tion, to the appropriations bill that is 
on its way through here. 
With Congress deadlocked on how to 
come up with a broader solution for 
COVID–19, let’s at least do this. Let’s 
say to the administration: We want 
you to continue this program that is 
now in place. The States know how it 
operates. The States have been imple-
menting it. 
My home State of Ohio has provided 
funding to people through this. We are 
appreciative of it. 
Our proposal is very straightforward. 
It simply appropriates $86.6 billion to 
replenish the Disaster Relief Fund, 
first to give FEMA the resources it 
needs to fully and effectively respond 
to the natural disasters that are hit-
ting parts of our country hard right 
now and those that are yet to come. 
The money won’t be wasted; it will be 
spent for appropriate things. 
Second, it would allow the $300 per 
week for the Lost Wages Assistance 
Program to continue through Novem-
ber 21, giving Congress what I hope 
would be more than enough time to 
come up with a broader solution to the 
COVID–19 issue. But at least through 
the period of time between now and 
just before Thanksgiving, people would 
be able to know they will continue to 
get this $300-per-week supplement to be 
able to put food on the table, pay the 
rent, or pay the car payment or the 
mortgage, and we as a Congress will be 
able to say to the people we represent: 
We haven’t forgotten about you. You 
lost your jobs through no fault of your 
own. We ought to be able to continue 
providing some help through this in-
terim period. 
This isn’t about political wins and 
losses; this is about lives and liveli-
hoods that are at stake. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in a bipartisan ef-
fort to support this important, com-
monsense legislation so we can bolster 
our response to the COVID–19 unem-
ployment crisis and to the natural dis-
asters that are currently facing our 
country. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to one of my 
personal heroes, Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. She spent her life in service 
to the American people, quite literally. 
Whether the Supreme Court was hear-
ing arguments about civil rights, re-
productive rights for women, pro-
tecting our environment, our precious 
water and air, or standing up for our 
workers, Justice Ginsburg could be 
counted on to put the needs of the 
American people first every time. 
She may not have looked like much 
of a fighter, but this tiny Jewish 
grandmother in the lace collar punched 
far above her weight. The American 
people were so fortunate to have her on 
their side of the ring. I feel fortunate 
as a woman in America. My daughter 
and my granddaughters, too, have 
known she was there over and over 
again, fighting for us. 
That certainly was the case on 
healthcare. I have said over and over 
again on the floor of the Senate that 
healthcare isn’t political; it is personal 
for each one of us. It is personal. Jus-
tice Ginsburg understood that in her 
bones. As a person who had experienced 
her own health challenges and health 
challenges in her family, she knew that 
when a beloved spouse is diagnosed 
with cancer or a child with a fever 
needs to go to the emergency room, 
politics is the last thing on their 
minds.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5819 
September 23, 2020 
When people tell me their healthcare 
stories, they don’t start by telling me 
whether they are a Democrat or a Re-
publican. That is because when it 
comes to healthcare and the health of 
our families, it simply doesn’t matter. 
People in Michigan just want to 
know that if they or their loved ones 
get sick or are hurt, they are going to 
be able to take them to the doctor and 
get the healthcare they need. Unfortu-
nately, with the loss of Justice Gins-
burg, Michigan families and families 
all across the country have an extra 
reason to be very concerned right now. 
One week after the election—just 1 
week after the election—the Supreme 
Court will hear arguments in the case 
that could overturn the Affordable 
Care Act, overturn everything, all of 
the protections—including, of course, 
the preexisting conditions coverage— 
all of it. By the way, the President of 
the United States, Donald Trump, has 
weighed in and is in favor of having 
that happen. 
Everything is at stake, including 
coverage for 17 million people through 
the expansion of Medicaid, where min-
imum-wage 
workers 
right 
now 
in 
States like Michigan that have ex-
panded Medicaid no longer have to pick 
between minimum-wage jobs and not 
working and having healthcare. It is so 
important. 
Also at stake is the ability for chil-
dren to remain on their parents’ health 
plans until age 26, which has trans-
formed so many families’ opportunities 
and young people’s opportunities, and 
coverage for preventive services like 
cancer screening and maternity care. 
Prior to the Affordable Care Act, you 
had to get extra coverage for mater-
nity care. It wasn’t viewed as basic. It 
was basic for me when I was having my 
children, and for women across the 
country, it is pretty basic. It wasn’t 
viewed as basic, essential care. It now 
is under the Affordable Care Act. 
Also at risk are mental health care 
and treatment for substance use dis-
orders, lower prescription drug prices 
for seniors, and protections for people 
with preexisting conditions. 
It is estimated that about half of 
Michigan 
families 
include 
someone 
with a preexisting condition, every-
thing from heart disease to asthma, to 
high blood pressure, to cancer. Nation-
wide, we are talking about 130 million 
people. How many more people now, 
after COVID–19, will have a preexisting 
condition? 
In other words, what happens in the 
next few months—what happens in 
terms of filling another Supreme Court 
vacancy, as well as what happens in 
the election—could have life-or-death 
consequences for Michigan families and 
families across the country. 
In case anyone has forgotten, we are 
in the middle of a once-in-a-lifetime 
pandemic. More than 200,000 Americans 
have already lost their lives, and unfor-
tunately that number is going up every 
single day. In my own State, nearly 
7,000 people have lost their lives—7,000 
moms 
and 
dads, 
grandmas 
and 
grandpas, brothers and sisters, children 
and friends. Even though some have 
survived COVID–19, they may be left 
with long-term health issues, from 
heart damage to breathing difficulties, 
to neurological problems, which, as I 
said before, creates preexisting condi-
tions. 
This is not the time to be ripping 
healthcare away from American fami-
lies. There is never a good time but 
certainly not now. Yet that is exactly 
the scenario we could be facing. 
As Justice Ginsburg said, ‘‘Health 
care is not like a vegetable or other 
items one is at liberty to buy or not to 
buy.’’ When a Michigan single mom 
discovers a lump and finds out that she 
has breast cancer, she can’t just hope 
it will go away. When a Michigan sen-
ior with diabetes needs insulin, he 
can’t just wait for a big sale and stock 
up when the price is right. When a 
child spikes a high fever in the middle 
of the night, her parents can’t just tell 
her: Well, you know, the money is 
tight right now, so you are going to 
have to wait to see a doctor. That is 
the horror for all of us as parents, that 
our child will get sick and we won’t be 
able to take them to the doctor. 
Healthcare isn’t political; it is per-
sonal. It isn’t about policy; it is about 
people—people. It is about the people 
in our States who sent us here to fight 
on their behalf. 
I sincerely hope that by the time the 
Senate votes on the next Supreme 
Court Justice—if, unfortunately, it 
comes before the people have their say 
about who should be making that nom-
ination and confirming that appoint-
ment—if that is going to be rushed 
through, jammed through by this Sen-
ate, I hope there will be four U.S. Sen-
ators on the other side of the aisle who 
will have the courage to stand up for 
the people who need healthcare—and, 
frankly, that is all of us. 
One thing I do know for sure is that 
the American people are courageous. 
Time and again, they have called us 
and written letters and have even come 
to DC to make their voices heard. 
From the amazing Little Lobbyists to 
ALS warrior Ady Barkan, to my friend 
Lauren Kovach, who fights so hard to 
find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease and 
other dementias, these folks would 
probably rather be spending their time 
doing something else, but they under-
stand that healthcare isn’t a luxury; it 
is a necessity. 
This should not be political. It is per-
sonal to each and every one of us. 
Again and again, people across the 
country have stepped up. They have 
gotten engaged. They have put their 
passion 
to 
work 
protecting 
our 
healthcare. Their voices and the voices 
of millions of Americans have made 
the difference in this Chamber to the 
majority in this Chamber—saying no 
to repealing the Affordable Care Act 
and ripping healthcare away from mil-
lions of Americans. That only hap-
pened because people stood up and 
made their voices known and were ac-
tively engaged in saying what was im-
portant to them and their families. 
It is easy to throw up our hands and 
give in and let the sadness and feelings 
of loss for Justice Ginsburg and all of 
the frustrations and chaos and the suf-
fering take over all of us, but RBG 
would never let that happen. If she 
were here right now, she would say: No, 
no, no. This is the moment to focus and 
engage and to fight even harder. 
When, as a Harvard Law student, she 
was asked by the dean why she felt en-
titled to take a slot that otherwise 
would have gone to a man, she didn’t 
let that faze her. When she struggled to 
land a job after graduation, she took to 
teaching at Rutgers School of Law and 
hid her second pregnancy under baggy 
clothes until her contract was renewed. 
She later challenged the New Jersey 
law that forced pregnant teachers to 
quit their jobs. When she was diag-
nosed with cancer for the first time in 
1999, she fought back and kept on fight-
ing for more than 20 years. 
It is time now for all of us to fight, 
all of us who care about our freedoms 
and our very way of life in this coun-
try. It is time to fight like our beloved 
RBG, like she did everyday of her life 
for us. 
Justice Ginsburg once said this: 
‘‘Fight for the things that you care 
about, but do it in a way that will lead 
others to join you.’’ I am asking the 
American people right now to join us 
in this fight. This is not a done deal. It 
is not over, and we all as Senators will 
be held accountable for what we do. 
Call your Senators, write emails and 
letters, talk to your friends and neigh-
bors, and let them know what is at 
stake—from healthcare and reproduc-
tive rights for women to protecting our 
air and clean water, to the capacity to 
be able to collectively bargain for 
wages and safety and benefits, to vot-
ing rights and civil rights. We can go 
on and on. It is all on the line right 
now. We need to step up and fight and 
not assume anything is a done deal. We 
need to hold our Republican colleagues 
accountable. 
Don’t let them get away with taking 
healthcare away from millions of peo-
ple. We did it before when we stopped 
the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. I 
think we have to fight now to do the 
same thing and vote like your life and 
the lives of your family depend on it, 
because they actually do. 
Justice Ginsburg dedicated her life to 
making our country more fair, more 
free, and more just. Now is the time to 
continue her fight for our future, for 
our 
children, 
and 
for 
our 
grand-
children. 
I yield the floor.

SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we

S5820 
September 23, 2020 
to examine the qualifications of that 
nominee and hold a vote here on a 
timely basis. 
This, of course, is set in line with the 
precedent set by Presidents and Sen-
ates that were elected long before we 
became Members of this body or were 
even born, and we are prepared to fol-
low suit. There were 29 times when 
there was a vacancy during the elec-
tion year where the party occupying 
the White House and the majority of 
the Senate were the same, and 29 times 
there were confirmation processes, and 
it will be the same again this year with 
the 30th. 
As always, we will be thorough. As a 
member of the Judiciary Committee, I 
have had the privilege of participating 
in a number of confirmation hearings 
for Supreme Court Justices. I know 
every member of the committee takes 
this job very seriously—our role of ad-
vice and consent under the Constitu-
tion. We will not rush the process. 
Every Member of this body will have 
an opportunity to vote for or against 
the nominee once the nominee is voted 
out of the Judiciary Committee. 
But it seems that for our friends on 
the other side of the aisle, precedent is 
not enough. The prospect of another 
Trump-appointed Supreme Court Jus-
tice has mobilized our Democratic col-
leagues to launch an attack that has 
been months in the making on our very 
independent judiciary. 
One of the hallmarks of our Constitu-
tion and our democracy is an inde-
pendent judiciary—an umpire, if you 
will—that will mediate the fight be-
tween the executive and legislative 
branches and rule on the very constitu-
tionality of the laws that are passed. 
Long before this vacancy even existed, 
though, 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
were sounding the alarm, suggesting 
they would expand or pack the Su-
preme Court with liberal Justices that 
will rubberstamp the political results 
they could not achieve through legisla-
tion. 
During the Presidential primary this 
year, candidates were especially eager 
to share their vision for a larger and 
solidly liberal Supreme Court. A num-
ber of our Senate colleagues were 
among those open to the idea, includ-
ing the current Democratic candidate 
for Vice President, the Senator from 
California. 
Over the last several months, Demo-
crats in both the House and the Senate, 
including House Judiciary Committee 
Chairman JERRY
NADLER, have ex-
pressed an interest in upending the in-
tegrity of the Supreme Court and its 
role in leading the independent judicial 
branch. Once the Supreme Court va-
cancy went from a possibility to a re-
ality, these comments have now turned 
into threats. 
Over the weekend, the junior Senator 
from 
Massachusetts 
tweeted 
that 
‘‘when Democrats control the Senate 
in the next Congress, we must abolish 
the filibuster and expand the Supreme 
Court.’’ 
The Senator from New York, the mi-
nority leader himself, reportedly told 
his Members on a call this weekend, 
which was reported in social media: 
‘‘Nothing is off the table.’’ 
Now, mistreatment of conservative 
nominees to the courts is nothing new, 
including 2 years ago, when Democrats 
waged 
an 
all-out 
smear 
campaign 
against Justice Kavanaugh. But now, 
even before the nominee is announced, 
our Democratic colleagues are taking 
aim at the institution itself. 
We know this isn’t the first time that 
our colleagues have floated institu-
tional changes to shift the political 
tide in their favor. When they lost the 
Senate majority, they decided they 
wanted to add new States. They are un-
interested in bipartisanship. So they 
want to end the legislative filibuster. 
And now they threaten to pack the 
court with liberal Justices to give 
them a political outcome. They are 
taking the saying, ‘‘if you can’t win 
the game, change the rules,’’ to a 
whole new level. 
This isn’t just political gamesman-
ship anymore. It is an assault on the 
Constitution itself, along with the in-
tegrity of our article III courts and our 
system of checks and balances. This 
court-packing threat isn’t new. It pre-
ceded the death of Justice Ginsburg in 
the creation of the vacancy that we 
will soon consider, but they are now 
trying to rebrand the reasoning behind 
it. 
Since the idea was previously viewed 
as too radical by members of their own 
party, with even Justice Ginsburg op-
posing it, they are trying to shift the 
blame to Republicans. By following the 
precedent of 29 judicial confirmation 
hearings occurring during an election 
year and undermining or challenging 
the Senate’s constitutional duty to 
provide advice and consent, our Demo-
cratic colleagues claim that it is we 
who are responsible for an attack on 
democracy. They, in effect, are holding 
the Supreme Court hostage in saying: 
Don’t make me kill the hostage. 
Democrats aren’t just trying to pre-
vent a single conservative Justice from 
joining the Court. They are trying to 
dismantle the very institution itself. 
The Supreme Court has had nine Jus-
tices for more than 150 years. As the 
balance has shifted in many different 
directions over the years, Members of 
Congress have respectfully refrained 
from 
engaging 
in 
such 
dangerous 
threats. 
This isn’t just about a conservative 
Justice or a liberal Justice. It is about 
preserving one of our most basic insti-
tutions—a free and independent judici-
ary. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Mr. President, now on another mat-
ter, by virtually any measure our econ-
omy was booming at the start of this 
year. Successful reforms under the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act allowed workers to 
keep more of what they earned and 
gave job creators the freedom to create 
new economic opportunities for the 
American people. 
Within the first 2 years of these 
changes, we experienced record gains in 
employment and increases in house-
hold income for families across the 
country, including Hispanic and Afri-
can-American households. New census 
data paints a clear picture of just how 
strong the economy was in 2019. The 
median household income reached an 
all-time high of $68,700. That is a 6.8- 
percent increase over the previous 
year. Not only that, if you look at the 
dollar amount alone, it is almost dou-
ble the next highest dollar amount in 
annual growth. 
As I said, Black and Hispanic Ameri-
cans each experienced a higher than 
average growth rate and historically 
low unemployment rates. Median earn-
ings increased 7.8 percent for women, 
compared to 2.5 percent for men, rep-
resenting progress in the fight to close 
the pay gap. 
The benefits of our booming market, 
though, didn’t stop there. The new jobs 
and opportunities created during this 
boom drew more workers who had been 
on the sidelines into the labor market, 
and the result was spectacular. The 
poverty rate dropped to 10.5 percent, 
which is the lowest since 1959. Every 
population group made gains. Regard-
less of race, gender, age, disability sta-
tus, or marital status, each group expe-
rienced a decline in the poverty rate. 
Make no mistake about it. We still 
have a long way to go to ensure that no 
family in America lives in poverty, but 
we also ought to be willing to assess 
progress when progress is made. There 
is no doubt that our economic engine 
was humming and the American people 
were seeing and feeling the benefits of 
our strong economy every single day. 
And then, of course, the pandemic hit. 
Suddenly, after years of adding new 
jobs and creating economic opportuni-
ties for millions of Americans, it felt 
like the gains we made were erased in 
the blink of an eye. 
Through no fault of their own, busi-
nesses were forced to close their doors 
to help slow the spread of the virus, 
and with no tables to wait on, cus-
tomers to serve, or travelers to accom-
modate, millions of workers were left 
without a way to earn a living. Well- 
meaning 
employers, 
sadly, 
handed 
their workers pink slips and said they 
hoped to have jobs for them to come 
back to once the pandemic was in the 
rearview mirror. 
Until that could happen, millions of 
Americans relied on enhanced unem-
ployment benefits, which ended at the 
end of July, including an extra $600 a 
week in Federal benefits. But there are 
still families across Texas struggling 
to make ends meet, and there are 
workers waiting to return to their jobs 
with no end in sight. 
While we have made progress against 
the virus, we have to make progress, 
too, in recovering our economy. In the 
beginning, restaurants and retailers 
began adding curbside service and de-
livery to regain some income, and 
throughout most of Texas now, these

businesses are able to open to 75 per-
cent of capacity. Gladly, we are seeing 
more and more workers returning to 
work and our children returning to 
school. 
In Texas, unemployment has steadily 
declined from a peak of 13.5 percent to 
6.8 percent in August. I think a lot of 
that progress is due to the success of 
the CARES Act and, especially, the 
Paycheck Protection Program, which 
sent more than $41 billion in more than 
417,000 different loans to small busi-
nesses in Texas alone. 
I am still hoping that we can come to 
an agreement on another coronavirus 
relief bill that would extend the Pay-
check Protection Program and provide 
some enhanced level of Federal em-
ployment benefits, but those measures 
alone will not support our economic re-
covery. We know that regaining lost 
ground will not happen overnight. It is 
going to take time for our country to 
return to the pre-pandemic economy 
that the President and Republican Sen-
ate fought so hard to achieve. 
As we consider the most effective 
ways to tune up our economic engine, 
our guiding principle should be that of 
the doctor-patient oath—the Hippo-
cratic oath: First, do no harm. 
Raising trillions of dollars in new 
taxes, as a number of leading Demo-
crats have suggested, would be coun-
terproductive. It wouldn’t grow the 
economy. It would kill the economy. In 
2009, as the Nation was fighting to re-
cover from the 2008 recession, Presi-
dent Obama was asked about the possi-
bility of raising taxes, and he didn’t 
mince words. He said: The last thing 
you want to do is raise taxes in the 
middle of a recession. 
That is exactly right, but that is ex-
actly the opposite of what the leading 
Democratic candidates, including the 
Democratic nominee for President, are 
advocating. They are advocating for a 
huge tax increase, even as we are hope-
fully closer to the end of the pandemic 
than we are the beginning. It is just 
the wrong medicine for what ails our 
economy, as President Obama noted. 
Families, we know, are still strug-
gling, workers are still hurting, and 
the American people need more money 
in their paychecks, not less. We need to 
look at what made the 2019 economy 
such a success and try to ensure that 
those changes prop us up for a strong 
comeback, and I think the best place to 
start is with the success of the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act. 
After it passed almost 3 years ago, I 
traveled across my State and met with 
business owners and employees who 
were reaping the immediate benefits. 
Those were in the form of new hires, 
bonuses, raises, and 401(k) match in-
creases. Employees at every business of 
every size were seeing the benefits of 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While some 
of the provisions of that law are perma-
nent, others are set to expire in 2025, 
and, without action, things like the 
lower income tax rate for individuals 
and the increased child tax credit will 
expire. 
As we work to support our country 
through the recovery process, we need 
to emulate the reforms that made our 
booming economy a reality in the first 
place. As I said, I don’t expect the road 
to recovery to be quick, but there are 
steps that we can take to make it easi-
er. 
First, we could do our job by sup-
porting the individuals and businesses 
hit hardest by the pandemic. Time and 
again, our Democratic colleagues have 
objected to us even considering legisla-
tion to continue those important provi-
sions of the CARES Act. We can take 
the government’s boot off of job cre-
ator’s necks, and we can fight to bring 
jobs back that were shipped overseas 
because we learned a lot about vulner-
able supply chains and manufacturing 
that needs to be returned to the United 
States. 
Following tax reform, millions of 
new jobs were created, and Americans 
brought home more of their hard- 
earned money. As a result, we reached 
3.5 percent unemployment—the lowest 
unemployment rate in a half a century. 
That progress was possible because of 
the right policies that increased take- 
home pay for workers and unleashed 
the power of the private sector. So I 
have no doubt, as we rebuild our econ-
omy, that we will do so if we continue 
to embrace the policies that made 2019 
a banner year. 
Let me just conclude by saying that 
we must pass another COVID–19 relief 
bill. Time and again, Speaker PELOSI 
has refused to negotiate in good faith 
to come up with a compromise. In the 
meantime, airlines that employ tens of 
thousands of people in my State and 
across the country will begin laying off 
their employees beginning October 1. 
Businesses that were sustained by the 
PPP program have now run out of 
those funds, and they need to be re-
plenished. 
I get questions time and again about 
the lapsing of the enhanced unemploy-
ment benefit that was part of the 
CARES Act. We tried to extend that at 
some reasonable level, but our Demo-
cratic colleagues objected, blocked it, 
and stopped it. 
What I fear, as Chairman Powell of 
the Federal Reserve and Secretary 
Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, have 
suggested, is that the massive stimulus 
that we provided, roughly $3 trillion 
through four bills that were passed on 
a bipartisan basis—that has sustained 
our economy and brought us to where 
we are today, even in the darkest of 
times through this pandemic, but if we 
leave here with our Democratic col-
leagues having prevented us from pro-
viding another COVID–19 relief bill, I 
think it guarantees nothing but pain 
for the economy, American workers, 
and American families. We should not 
go down that path or tolerate it. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Wash-
ington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to be allowed 
to finish my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
WASHINGTON STATE WILDFIRES 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
rise to speak about three critical mat-
ters impacting families in Washington 
State and across this country today. 
First of all, I would like to say that 
even though the wildfires in my State 
are being contained, thanks to the 
skilled work of brave and dedicated 
firefighters, wildfires and health im-
pacts of smoke are still creating haz-
ardous conditions throughout the Pa-
cific Northwest. Until we begin ad-
dressing the drivers of those natural 
disasters, like climate change, we 
know these crises and the suffering 
they bring will only continue getting 
worse. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Secondly, I want to talk about three 
nominees under consideration for the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, or the EEOC. 
One of these nominees is Jocelyn 
Samuels. She is exactly who workers 
need right now. As the coronavirus 
continues to impact workplaces across 
the country, workers are facing un-
precedented challenges, and they need 
a champion at the EEOC who will work 
tirelessly 
to 
defend 
their 
rights. 
Jocelyn Samuels is that champion. 
With almost 20 years of experience in 
the Federal Government, including at 
the EEOC itself, she has spent her ca-
reer working to address discrimination 
and making sure no one is treated un-
fairly because of their age, their race, 
or their disability. 
I am confident she will be an excel-
lent Commissioner. I am proud to vote 
to confirm her nomination and strong-
ly urge my Senate colleagues to join 
me in supporting her nomination. 
Unfortunately, the other two nomi-
nees already approved by the Senate— 
Andrea Lucas and Keith Sonderling— 
will 
likely 
have 
disastrous 
con-
sequences for workers’ rights. These 
are two people who have spent their ca-
reers working to protect corporations, 
not workers. 
As a lawyer, Andrea Lucas has never 
defended workers. Her only legal expe-
rience is defending corporations when 
workers tried to fight back against sex-
ual harassment or age discrimination 
and disability discrimination. That is 
exactly the opposite type of experience 
and values we need at the EEOC, which 
is why I voted against her nomination. 
Keith Sonderling’s record is no bet-
ter. During his time at the Trump ad-
ministration’s Department of Labor, 
Keith Sonderling worked to churn out 
policies that hurt workers. 
From his joint employer rule that 
lets massive corporations off the hook 
for minimum wage, overtime, and 
equal pay violations to his initiative 
that gives companies a ‘‘get out of jail 
free’’ 
card 
for 
wage 
theft, 
Keith 
Sonderling’s legacy at the DOL has 
made it harder for workers to fight for 
their rights and easier for companies to 
abuse them. For those reasons, I op-
posed his nomination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5822 
September 23, 2020 
Finally, right now, our Nation is fac-
ing truly trying times. Two hundred 
thousand 
lives 
have 
been 
lost 
to 
COVID, millions are unemployed, and 
we just lost a treasured American hero, 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
So much hangs in the balance now, 
and people are already voting and orga-
nizing to make sure their healthcare, 
their rights, and their futures are pro-
tected in this election. 
For those nationwide who have al-
ready cast their ballots and who will 
vote in the coming weeks for the future 
of our country and to help ensure 
trust—trust in our democracy—the 
people must have a vote in this nomi-
nation. 
The next President should choose 
Justice Ginsburg’s replacement as she 
wished to spare our democracy the 
painful chaos of making such a deci-
sion so close to an election. 
People are speaking out, and the Sen-
ate must listen, as Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL insisted only a few years 
ago. But, unfortunately, it seems like 
my colleagues on the other side are 
content to ignore these cries, just like 
they have neglected the cries of our 
constituents for a COVID–19 relief 
package that meets this moment in-
stead of shortchanging our commu-
nities 
because 
nothing—nothing 
is 
more important than pushing through 
their ideological agenda to jam as 
many partisan judges on the bench as 
possible, especially on the Supreme 
Court, and tip the balance of our Fed-
eral judiciary even further against ev-
eryday people, packing our courts to 
ensure we can’t make progress to de-
fend affordable healthcare and pre-
existing conditions protections or ad-
dressing the climate crisis or strength-
ening protections for workers or doing 
anything on the critical issues that 
people in my home State of Wash-
ington and around the Nation care so 
deeply about and that have been 
blocked time and again by the Repub-
lican Party. 
I will be doing absolutely everything 
I can to make sure everyone from 
Washington State to Washington, DC, 
and my Republican colleagues here in 
Congress know just how much is at 
risk if President Trump gets to appoint 
another hard-right nominee an unprec-
edented 41 days before a Presidential 
election. 
It is truly impossible to understate 
the consequences for families and com-
munities across the country now and 
for generations to come. President 
Trump has made it clear he wants a 
nominee who will gut protections for 
preexisting conditions, who will take 
healthcare away from millions of peo-
ple nationwide, and do everything they 
can to undermine basic rights and free-
doms and protections through the 
Court, including crucial worker protec-
tions that Justice Ginsburg, herself, 
helped secure and the EEOC is tasked 
with enforcing. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in voting today to honor an important 
part of Justice Ginsburg’s legacy and 
vote for the nomination of Jocelyn 
Samuels. Then let’s keep fighting for 
people’s healthcare, for protections for 
preexisting conditions, for workers’ 
rights, 
and 
voters’ 
rights, 
and 
LGBTQIA+ rights, and for the vision of 
a just and equal country—a just and 
equal country Justice Ginsburg fought 
so hard to advance. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
I come to the floor to talk about 
COVID in two ways. The Senator from 
Tennessee, who is presiding today, will 
appreciate this. She and I have a reg-
ular call with Governor Lee, our Gov-
ernor, and we just finished part of it. 
Her staff was on part of that. 
He gave some very interesting infor-
mation that I think would be impor-
tant to all Senators and to our coun-
try, and that is the significant learning 
loss that occurs when children aren’t 
in school. In Tennessee, Governor Lee 
and some national researchers have 
completed a study of the learning loss 
in the third grade for reading and math 
proficiency for children who were not 
in school from March through the sum-
mer. 
Now, you always have a learning loss 
in the summer, but for March through 
summer, this is what they found. Pre-
liminary data shows an estimated 50- 
percent decrease in proficiency rates in 
third grade reading and a projected 65- 
percent decrease in proficiency in 
math. That, in the Governor’s words, is 
a dramatic decrease. It shows that the 
vast majority of students learn in per-
son, the Governor said, with their 
teacher, and he is working to get a safe 
environment so that they can get back 
to school. 
The good news on that is, according 
to the Governor, 1,800 schools in Ten-
nessee are open, in person, and only 7 
of those schools have any sort of clo-
sure incident today—in other words, 
one class or one school closed because 
of COVID. So, this problem we are just 
discussing, hopefully, will not be as 
pronounced this semester in Tennessee 
because, except in Memphis and except 
in Nashville, almost all of our schools 
are open in person to some degree. 
The Governor went on to say that the 
March through the summer school 
closings produced a learning deficiency 
that is expected to be 2.5 times that of 
a normal summer rate. He also said the 
learning loss impacts early grades 
greater than later grades, placing those 
students further behind in the learning 
trajectory. Students with lower pro-
ficiency rates are also disproportion-
ately impacted by learning loss. In 
other words, students who are already 
behind fell behind even further as a re-
sult of leaving school in March. 
Then it shows that the research from 
the Organisation for Economic Co-op-
eration 
and 
Development, 
which 
worked with the Governor on these, 
shows that each additional year of 
schooling increases life income by an 
average of 7.5 to 10 percent. And with 
the loss of one-third of a year in effec-
tive learning—which is what we just 
heard about for just the students af-
fected by the closures—that organiza-
tion estimates it would lower a coun-
try’s gross domestic product by an av-
erage of 1.5 percent for the remainder 
of the century. 
I don’t know whether those numbers 
are exactly accurate, but the message 
is clear. Children, especially young 
children and especially young children 
who are further behind already, need to 
be in school so that they can be taught 
in person or their learning loss is dra-
matic. 
I ask unanimous consent to include 
in the RECORD the press release that 
Governor Lee of Tennessee released de-
tailing this dramatic learning loss. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
TENNESSEE RELEASES DATA SHOWING SIGNIFI-
CANT LEARNING LOSS AMONG K–12 STUDENTS 
PROJECTED LOSSES TIED TO PROLONGED SCHOOL 
CLOSURES AND TIME AWAY FROM CLASSROOM 
NASHVILLE, TN—Tennessee Governor Bill 
Lee and the Tennessee Department of Edu-
cation today released estimated data regard-
ing learning loss for Tennessee students re-
sulting 
from 
COVID–19 
school 
closures 
through the summer months. Preliminary 
data projects an estimated 50% decrease in 
proficiency rates in 3rd grade reading and a 
projected 65% decrease in proficiency in 
math. 
‘‘This data highlights the immense chal-
lenges that the COVID–19 pandemic has cre-
ated for our students and educators,’’ said 
Gov. Lee. ‘‘The vast majority of students 
learn best in-person with their teacher, and 
we’ll continue to help provide a safe environ-
ment for Tennessee students to get their 
educational journeys back on track.’’ 
While many students traditionally experi-
ence learning loss over the summer, projec-
tions show that learning loss from March 
school closures through the summer is ex-
pected to be 2.5 times that of a normal sum-
mer rate. Projections were developed in part-
nership with national researchers using his-
torical, Tennessee-specific data to provide 
additional learning loss estimates based on 
the extended school closures. 
‘‘We know that increased time away from 
school has negative implications for stu-
dents, which is compounded during extended 
building closures,’’ said Tennessee Commis-
sioner of Education Penny Schwinn. ‘‘The 
department is focused on ensuring we pro-
vide essential services and resources to miti-
gate learning loss and keep students on a 
path to success this new school year.’’ 
The learning loss impacts early grades 
greater than later grades, placing these stu-
dents further behind in the learning trajec-
tory as they progress through school. Stu-
dents with lower proficiency rates are also 
disproportionately 
impacted 
by 
learning 
loss, further exacerbating existing achieve-
ment gaps. 
Research from the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development on the 
economics of education shows that each ad-
ditional year of schooling increases life in-
come by an average of 7.5–10%. Further, a 
loss of one-third of a year in effective learn-
ing for just the students affected by the clo-
sures of early 2020 will, by historical data, 
lower a country’s GDP by an average of 1.5% 
over the remainder of the century. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Today, our com-
mittee—the Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions Committee—had its last

S5824 
September 23, 2020 
hearing of the year, and it was my last 
hearing as chairman of the committee. 
While we are on the theme of edu-
cation, one of the interesting—and I 
am here today to give a little report on 
what I consider to be an unprecedented 
sprint toward success in three areas: 
vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic 
testing. 
I asked Dr. Fauci, who was one of the 
witnesses, this question: Dr. Fauci, 
there are a lot of outbreaks on college 
campuses around the country as mil-
lions of students go back to thousands 
of colleges. Is the right thing to do to 
send the students home? 
He said: Absolutely not. That is the 
wrong thing to do. Segregate the stu-
dents from the other students in the 
college until they are well—and the 
people they have exposed until they are 
well—and then go on. Don’t send them 
home to infect their parents and their 
grandparents and the community from 
which they came. 
I think that is important advice for 
the college administrators all over 
America who are dealing with this 
issue very bravely. I know at the Uni-
versity of Tennessee they had a big 
outbreak. It was some poor judgment 
on behalf of a number of students who 
had just gone back to school. You can 
just imagine 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds, 
they all want to get together. Well, 
they got together, and they infected 
one another, and they had a big out-
break—maybe 750, the Governor said, 
but it is now down to 150. 
So Dr. Fauci’s advice to the school 
administrators is this: Isolate them, 
segregate them, track them, and don’t 
send them home. 
The hearing today included Dr. Fauci 
and Dr. Redfield from the Centers for 
Disease Control. It included Admiral 
Giroir, who is in charge of testing, and 
it included Dr. Hahn, who is the head 
of the Food and Drug Administration. 
Here was the first question I asked 
Dr. Hahn, who is the only person who 
knows when the vaccines that are 
being developed will be distributed. He 
doesn’t really know because he doesn’t 
know the date, nor do any of the career 
scientists at the FDA know the date 
when the data will show that the vac-
cine is safe and effective, and it will 
not be distributed until it is. 
So I said to Dr. Hahn: Who makes the 
decisions at FDA? Do you make the de-
cisions? Do the career scientists make 
the decisions? Or does the White House 
make the decisions about safety and ef-
fectiveness of a vaccine? 
He said: The career scientists make 
the decisions. The White House does 
not, and I will not make a decision 
about the safety and effectiveness of 
vaccines unless the career scientists 
and I agree that it is safe and effective 
according to independent and trans-
parent data. 
I asked Dr. Fauci this question. I 
said: Dr. Fauci, you have been around a 
while. You came on in the Reagan 
days. You have been in your job as 
head of infectious diseases since 1984. 
Here is my question: Is this adminis-
tration cutting corners on safety and 
efficiency? 
Dr. Fauci said: Absolutely not. 
I asked all four of the witnesses: If 
the vaccine is approved by the FDA, 
would you take it, and would you rec-
ommend your family take it? 
They said yes, that they had great 
confidence in the FDA. 
Here is a summary of what they told 
us today. Let’s start with vaccines: 
According to the administration, it is 
already manufacturing tens of millions 
of doses of six vaccines, and by the end 
of the year, there will be tens of mil-
lions of doses of these vaccines already 
manufactured, ready to distribute— 
first, of course, to the priority individ-
uals, those who are most vulnerable, 
healthcare workers, and others. 
Then, according to the administra-
tion, they expect to be able to produce 
300 to 700 million doses of vaccines by 
March or April of next year. That is 
unprecedented. 
When I was a kid, we were terrified 
by polio. I had classmates who were in 
an iron lung and parents who were wor-
ried their children might be just as 
well. It took 10 years to get a polio vac-
cine, and polio is now eradicated. 
For most of the vaccines that our 
children 
take 
before 
they 
go 
to 
school—like 
mumps, 
measles, 
and 
chickenpox—you have to take these 
vaccines in all 50 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia before you go to 
school. Most of them took 10 years to 
develop. 
If the optimism of the administra-
tion—they 
call 
it 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed—is accurate, vaccines will have 
been manufactured, and they are opti-
mistic that at least one of them will be 
approved before the end of the year. 
They know they will be manufactured 
because they are already doing that. 
They don’t know for sure, and they 
say: There is no guarantee of success, 
but we are optimistic that we will 
reach a goal that once was considered 
impossible and now seems likely. 
In other words, instead of waiting 10 
years for a vaccine to save lives, this 
vaccine for COVID–19 will be developed 
in less than a year if it is approved be-
fore the end of the year. 
That is an unprecedented success 
story, and it is only possible for a vari-
ety of reasons, which I will go into in 
a minute. 
The same is true with treatments. 
There are five treatments—medicines— 
for those who have contracted COVID– 
19. That is especially interesting to 
teachers 
and 
faculty 
members 
at 
schools and colleges. The children 
don’t seem to get as sick, but the older 
teachers could, and they do get sicker. 
So it helps to know that there is a 
treatment for COVID if you get sick. 
What we are told by Dr. Fauci, Dr. 
Redfield, Dr. Hahn, and others is that 
they are cautiously optimistic that 
new treatments will be available in the 
next 
few 
weeks—specifically, 
the 
monoclonal antibodies, the antibody 
cocktails that were developed and used 
during the Ebola crisis to help prevent 
and cure it. 
If these work—and, again, they only 
can be approved based on data from the 
FDA. They are not approved yet. They 
are in clinical trials, but late clinical 
trials. If they are approved in the next 
few weeks, then, if you come down with 
COVID, you will have an antibody 
cocktail that, in the case of the Ebola, 
proved to prevent and help cure it. 
Knowing that these vaccines are 
being manufactured and are likely to 
be approved by the end of the year and 
that treatments will be broadly avail-
able by the end of the year, in addition 
to the five that now exist, should help 
give Americans more confidence in 
going back to school, back to college, 
back to childcare, back to work, and 
out to eat. 
Then, there is a third success story, 
and that is diagnostic testing. The 
United States got off to a bumpy start 
with diagnostic testing. The first CDC 
test flopped, and we lost some time. 
But since then there has been an explo-
sion of diagnostic testing. 
Today, we have a capacity to deal 
with 90 million tests a month. Abbott 
Laboratories has announced that in Oc-
tober, it will produce 50 million rapid 
tests. You can get a result in 15 min-
utes with a higher degree of speci-
ficity—that means accuracy—and it 
costs 
$5. 
The 
administration 
has 
bought 150 million—the whole output— 
for the first 3 months of Abbott Lab-
oratories’ fast tests and is in the proc-
ess of distributing them to nursing 
homes, schools, colleges, childcare cen-
ters, and States. 
I was able to say to the Governor 
that if Tennessee gets its rough share 
of 2 percent of 150 million tests, that is 
a lot of tests for the State of Tennessee 
to be receiving over the next few 
weeks. 
Again, the importance of that is, be-
tween now and the time a vaccine is 
administered and treatments are wide-
ly available, the surest path back to 
school, back to work, and out to eat is 
an oversupply of diagnostic testing so 
you could have it whenever you want. 
Just as Governor Lee was saying, we 
have 1,800 schools open in person, Nash-
ville and Memphis worrying about 
whether they should open. I think if 
the teachers knew they had more 
treatments and if they could test 
whenever a class needs to test—a whole 
class—and do surveillance testing, that 
people would be safer and feel better 
about going back to school. 
The same would be true with the col-
leges and universities. If there is a 
breakout of 750 cases at the University 
of Tennessee and you can quickly do 
random surveillance testing of an en-
tire dorm or a dorm floor or a class of 
students, then you can feel better 
about keeping the place safe. 
The hearing was a good hearing. Dur-
ing the hearing, I thanked Senator 
MURRAY, my partner over the last 6 
years, the ranking Democrat. She is a

member of the Democratic leadership. 
She is pretty tough when she wants to 
be. Because she is, I like working with 
her, and we have been able to do a lot 
with our committee. 
We have 23 members on our com-
mittee. I thanked them today. I said, 
Senator Ted Kennedy used to say that 
we have the broadest jurisdiction of 
any committee in the Senate. I think 
we have the broadest range of views in 
the Senate of any committee. We have 
some very able advocates of those di-
verse points of view, and still, we have 
a very impressive record from fixing 
No Child Left Behind to 21st Century 
Cures, to the opioids bill, to passing 
important bipartisan legislation that is 
good for the country 
President Obama called the Every 
Student Succeeds Act a Christmas mir-
acle. Senator MCCONNELL said the 21st 
Century Cures Act was the most impor-
tant law of that Congress. 
I thanked Senator MURRAY and all 
the Democrats and Republicans on the 
committee for creating an environ-
ment where we can have our dif-
ferences of opinion but still get impor-
tant results. 
There was one other thing we dis-
cussed that I would like to mention. I 
see my friend from Connecticut on the 
floor. I know he wants to speak, and I 
will get out of the way so he can do it. 
But there were actually two things I 
wanted to briefly summarize, and then 
I will ask to put my statement into the 
RECORD. 
One was that the New York Times 
said on March 1, that the United States 
was as well prepared as any country for 
COVID. To the extent that was true, it 
was because of several Presidents and 
several Congresses doing such things 
as, in 2012, authorizing three standby 
manufacturing plants for vaccines. Of 
Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui, who 
is their principle adviser, said that 
they could not be producing four of 
those vaccines if those plants had not 
been put in place back then. 
In addition, earlier Congresses cre-
ated more authority for the FDA, for 
example, to do emergency-use author-
izations, which Dr. Hahn has used 
expertly. They have given the NIH 
record funding for 5 years in a row and 
new authority. All of this authority 
has been put to work by this adminis-
tration to do what I would call an un-
precedented sprint toward success on 
vaccines, treatments, and tests with-
out cutting corners on efficacy and 
safety. There is a risk, but the risk is 
to the taxpayers. 
The reason things are going so fast is 
because they are doing everything in 
parallel. They are manufacturing while 
they are developing the vaccine and 
while they are reviewing whether it is 
safe and effective. 
Then, at the end of that process—say, 
at the end of this year—if it is effec-
tive, we are ready to distribute it. The 
States have been asked to get ready. If 
it is not safe, if it is not effective, then, 
we lose the money. The taxpayers lose 
the money. 
I think most of us would be glad to 
lose that money if the result was that 
one or more of those vaccines turned 
out to be the one that produces 300 to 
700 million doses of vaccines that are 
safe and effective as we move into the 
new year. 
There is a lesson from all of this, and 
that is that the earlier Congresses and 
Presidents were visionary in this re-
spect: They built those standby manu-
facturing plants. They created BARDA. 
Senator BURR from North Carolina was 
one of the leaders of that, for example. 
Without that, we wouldn’t have this 
explosion of vaccines, treatments, and 
tests on the way. We need to do that 
again. 
Senator Bill Frist, the former major-
ity leader, testified before our com-
mittee with some others. He said we go 
from panic to neglect to panic, and we 
don’t do the hard things we need to do 
after the epidemic is over. 
The hardest thing to do is sustained 
funding. So we need sustained funding 
for manufacturing plants so they don’t 
go cold while we wait for the next pan-
demic. We need sustained funding for 
our stockpile so they are not depleted 
by budget problems. We need sustained 
funding for the strategic stockpile, and 
we need sustained funding for our 
State and local public health agencies, 
which are about 50 percent supported 
by Federal dollars. 
Sustained funding is something we 
don’t do very well—that means manda-
tory funding that needs advanced ap-
propriations. We like to do it year by 
year. But if we don’t do it, you can see 
what it costs us: 200,000 lives we lost al-
ready and $3 trillion we have already 
spent. So a little sustained funding to 
prevent the next pandemic would be a 
very wise investment, and we ought to 
do it now while we have our eye on the 
ball. 
Jared Diamond, who wrote ‘‘Guns, 
Germs, and Steel,’’ pointed out in a re-
cent article in the Wall Street Journal 
that, in his opinion, what is different 
about this vaccine is the jet plane— 
that people can fly from Wuhan to San 
Francisco or from San Francisco to 
Nashville, and pretty soon, suddenly, 
this is spreading all over the world. 
Jared Diamond said that the next pan-
demic could be next year. We hope it is 
not, but it could be, and we should be 
ready for it. 
So I wanted to report to the Amer-
ican people and to my colleagues in the 
Senate that we hear a lot about prob-
lems, but I think it is important to 
know that vaccines are being manufac-
tured, that the decisions are going to 
be made by scientists about when they 
are ready to distribute, that the States 
have been asked to get ready, that 
there are more treatments coming, 
likely, and that there has been an ex-
plosion of diagnostic tests. So, really, 
there should be plenty of diagnostic 
tests for anyone who wants to use them 
before very long in the United States. 
My theory has been for a long time 
that as soon as we had an oversupply, 
we wouldn’t have a problem or an 
issue. 
I thanked those four witnesses, Sen-
ator MURRAY, and my Republican and 
Democratic colleagues for monitoring 
this COVID–19. I am glad the hearing 
was broadly carried for 2 hours on 
many television networks. 
I hope it gave the American people 
some relief and sense that our chances 
of going back to school, back to col-
lege, back to childcare, back to work, 
and out to eat are increasingly good. It 
is very simple: Wear the mask, wash 
your hands, stay apart, and keep this 
unprecedented sprint toward vaccines, 
treatments, and diagnostic tests going. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise 
today to honor the life of Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg and to express my 
grave concerns at rushing to fill this 
Supreme Court vacancy rather than 
focus on the pandemic and its health 
and economic devastation. 
The passing of Justice Ginsburg is a 
monumental loss for our country, but 
she will leave an indelible mark as a 
historic and brilliant jurist, civil rights 
trailblazer, and personal hero to count-
less people. We can all take inspiration 
from her stalwart and lifelong crusade 
for equality, shaped by her own strug-
gles facing gender discrimination as a 
young lawyer, despite her outstanding 
education and obvious talent. 
Notably, one of her first and most 
important rulings as a Supreme Court 
Justice was when she wrote the major-
ity opinion that struck down the male-

only admissions policy at the Virginia 
Military Institute. In this and many 
other cases, Justice Ginsburg opened 
the door for generations to come and 
heralded a new era of equality so that 
those who were traditionally excluded 
and oppressed could truly partake in 
the American dream. 
Congress should honor Justice Gins-
burg’s legacy by grieving her loss with 
her family, her friends, and the rest of 
the Nation. More importantly, we 
should listen to the Justice’s wish that 
the Court she loved and served so hon-
orably should not be part of the elec-
tion season. My sense is Justice Gins-
burg recognized that, while the Court 
has become more political over time, 
filling her seat a month or so before an 
election would do incredible harm. 
Some say we need nine Justices. 
They certainly didn’t feel that way 
about Justice Scalia’s open seat. Rush-
ing here seems unnecessary, shows a 
disregard for history, and shows a lack 
of faith in the American people’s 
choice in November, but it appears 
they will not be thoughtful and wait. 
Instead, it is full steam ahead. 
I am angered and saddened that my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
are choosing to ram through a nominee 
who they know will not get broad sup-
port. While this is no different than 
their agenda over the last 4 years, the 
timing and circumstances could be not 
more startling or revealing as to their 
true priorities of power and stacking 
the deck. 
My colleagues have been rushing to 
issue statements pledging their support 
for a Supreme Court nominee that 
President Trump has not even nomi-
nated. However, in the 4 months since 
the Heroes Act passed the House, they 
have not been able to muster any ur-
gency to help the millions affected by 
the COVID pandemic. Indeed, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
keep bidding down the amount of as-
sistance they want to provide. 
Public health experts and economists 
alike have been sounding the alarm for 
weeks about what will happen if Con-
gress does not provide further assist-
ance. They warned that, without re-
sources for testing, contact tracing, 
and other critical public health inter-
ventions, the case counts and deaths 
will only increase. They warned that, 
without rental, unemployment, and 
food assistance, evictions would sky-
rocket and households with children 
will go hungry. They warned that 
States would have to resort to deep 
budget cuts and layoffs without addi-
tional aid. 
My 
Republican 
colleagues 
dis-
regarded 
these 
warnings 
even 
as 
COVID–19 numbers continued to climb 
and even after the pandemic unemploy-
ment assistance and Paycheck Protec-
tion Program expired. They looked for 
excuses not to act, only pausing to 
bring up their so-called skinny bills, 
which fell woefully short of providing 
the help that is needed for families, 
businesses, and the States. 
Due to the Trump administration’s 
mismanagement and Republicans’ in-
action, much of what these experts pre-
dicted is already happening, and we 
continue to pass grim milestones sig-
naling that we have failed to contain 
the virus and to adequately mitigate 
the economic fallout. 
More than 200,000 people have now 
died, and the Department of Labor re-
ports that nearly 30 million people are 
on unemployment. Despite the over-
whelming 
need, 
Republicans 
seem 
eager to move on and shift all of their 
attention to filling a Supreme Court 
seat in as little time as possible. 
They want to do it in a way that has 
never been done before. While other va-
cancies have arisen in an election year, 
the history is clear: The Senate has 
never confirmed a nomination to the 
Supreme Court this close to a Presi-
dential election. Yet it is looking more 
like Republicans want to barrel ahead 
and deny the American people a chance 
to weigh in. 
We have to ask ourselves: Why? One 
answer is easy: healthcare. My col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
along with President Trump, had com-
plete control of Congress and the White 
House for 2 years, and after spending 7 
years saying that they would repeal 
the Affordable Care Act, they tried 
with all of their might to do just that. 
What they didn’t anticipate was that 
the 
American 
people 
would 
turn 
against that effort. 
In 2017, I heard from countless con-
stituents, writing and emailing me, 
calling my office, approaching me at 
the grocery store and around Rhode Is-
land, telling me about how the ACA 
had benefited them and their families 
and urging me to do everything in my 
power to stop the Republican effort to 
repeal the law. I was not alone in this. 
I know my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle were hearing similar concerns 
from their constituents. 
President Trump and congressional 
Republicans did not expect that they 
wouldn’t be able to convince everyone 
in their party to go along with this 
scheme. As we all remember, late one 
night in July 2017, while voting on the 
Republican TrumpCare bill, my friend 
and 
my 
chairman, 
Senator 
John 
McCain, shortly before his death, cou-
rageously stood up and gave their pro-
posal a thumbs-down, saying enough 
was enough. 
The following year, the American 
people swiftly voted many Republicans 
out of office, handing control of the 
House of Representatives to Demo-
crats, largely because of healthcare. 
Democrats won by vowing to protect 
the ACA for the American people. 
So, now, President Trump and con-
gressional Republicans are counting on 
the courts to overturn the ACA for 
them. They have spent the last 3 years 
stacking the courts with judicial nomi-
nees who they think will rule against 
the ACA, regardless of the facts or 
merits of the case. 
With the passing of Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, they have their oppor-
tunity to add another anti-healthcare 
Justice to the Supreme Court, just 
days before the Court will begin argu-
ments on the Trump administration’s 
lawsuit to repeal the ACA. 
What is worse is that they are not 
going to wait until the election to pur-
sue this because they know the Amer-
ican people do not agree with them and 
they can’t take the chance that they 
will lose the election and, along with 
it, 
their 
opportunity 
to 
take 
healthcare coverage away from mil-
lions of Americans. 
Republicans’ fervor to fill a Supreme 
Court vacancy goes beyond disman-
tling affordable healthcare and denying 
healthcare to those with preexisting 
conditions. They are counting on a 
conservative supermajority on the Su-
preme Court to accomplish many of 
their 
extreme 
conservative 
goals, 
which they know the majority of the 
American people do not share. 
This will endanger so many of the 
rights that Americans have fought for 
decades to win. It could mean making 
our country less democratic by gutting 
what is left of the Voting Rights Act. 
It could mean overturning the right of 
women to make their own reproductive 
healthcare decisions, in consultation 
with their doctors, and the rights of 
LGBT individuals to live free of dis-
crimination. It could include stripping 
away environmental protections, which 
will become all the more important as 
climate change wreaks havoc in our 
communities. 
How these and many other issues are 
decided by the Supreme Court for the 
next several decades is hanging in the 
balance. That Republicans want to 
speed through their nominee shows not 
only their disdain for the will of the 
American people but, also, their lack of 
confidence that voters support these 
policy goals and those who wrongly 
espouse them. 
The only good that may come of this 
is that the American people will gain 
an even clearer understanding of what 
is at stake. The American public now 
has a clear choice, and I have no doubt 
that it will make the right one. They 
can see and understand what Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL is doing. 
At the very time the majority leader 
should be joining with us to protect the 
health of the American people in the 
midst of so much suffering and needless 
death during this pandemic, they are, 
instead, undertaking a misguided and 
unjustifiable effort to ram through a 
Supreme Court nomination. While I 
have little belief that Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL will change his plans, I 
would hope that my colleagues would 
take a moment and look at where we 
are. We can debate how we got here, 
but right now the matters before us are 
profound. I hope a few in the majority 
decide to reconsider and take a step 
back from their maximalist power the-
ory and leave this issue to the next ses-
sion. 
Until then, I will do everything I can 
to honor Justice Ginsburg and her

TRIBUTE TO DR. JAY BOX 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
more than 100,000 Kentuckians choose 
every year to pursue a degree or de-
velop their skills through the Ken-
tucky Community and Technical Col-
lege System, KCTCS. Composed of 16 
colleges within a short drive of vir-
tually 
every 
Kentucky 
household, 
KCTCS has helped over 1 million Ken-
tucky students receive an affordable 
and quality education. Today, I would 
like to recognize my friend, Dr. Jay 
Box, who has served as KCTCS’ second 
president for the last 5 years and is a 
leading architect of its success. As Jay 
retires at the end of this month, my 
home State will send him off with our 
sincere gratitude. 
Nearly two decades ago, Jay and his 
wife Gayle left Texas to join KCTCS. I 
am so glad they did. Jay brought with 
him a personal belief in the importance 
of lifelong learning to adapt to a 
changing workforce. That vision has 
served Jay and KCTCS’ students well 
while preparing them for 21st century 
careers. 
Jay was quickly recognized for his 
transformative leadership at Hazard 
Community 
and 
Technical 
College. 
Tapping into his talent, he was given 
statewide responsibilities as KCTCS 
vice president, chancellor, then finally 
its president. In each role, Jay has con-
stantly delivered for Kentucky stu-
dents. 
As president, Jay placed a renewed 
emphasis on helping students complete 
their degrees with a record number of 
graduates and credentials. He also en-
couraged schools to remove barriers, to 
support students pursuing GEDs and 
college credit at the same time, and to 
form partnerships with job creators to 
close the skills gap. As a result, grad-
uates are gaining the skills to meet 
local employers’ demands and enter the 
workforce prepared to fill good-paying 
jobs. 
His many achievements have brought 
national acclaim for both Jay and 
KCTCS. U.S. Secretary of Commerce 
Wilbur Ross and Advisor to the Presi-
dent Ivanka Trump appointed him to 
be the voice for community colleges on 
the American Workforce Policy Advi-
sory Board. Jay collaborates with lead-
ers from educational institutions, gov-
ernments, and some of the country’s 
largest employers to increase prepared-
ness in the workforce. Jay is also a 
member of the national board for Re-
building America’s Middle Class and 
the Bill and Melinda Gates Founda-
tion’s National Advisory Group. 
I have had the privilege to work di-
rectly with Jay to serve Kentucky’s 
students. I am particularly grateful for 
his leadership to save Southeast Ken-
tucky Community and Technical Col-
lege, SKCTC, from losing its ability to 
offer Federal student aid. Working 
closely with Jay, I inserted a legisla-
tive provision to give the school a rea-
sonable opportunity to make its case 
to the U.S. Department of Education. 
Jay and his team did just that, showing 
SKCTC’s many contributions to its 
students and community. I am proud 
to say the school continues to thrive 
and help prepare Kentucky students to 
excel in the workforce. 
Jay announced he would begin his 
well-deserved retirement in July. How-
ever, 
when 
the 
coronavirus 
crisis 
struck, he once again showed true lead-
ership. Jay delayed his retirement to 
continue serving Kentucky’s students 
and ensure KCTCS received the steady 
leadership transition it deserves. 
Over the years, Jay has helped edu-
cate students, encourage industry, and 
drive growth in nearly every corner of 
Kentucky. It is a remarkable legacy, 
and I hope he and Gayle are proud of 
their accomplishments. I ask my Sen-
ate colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating Dr. Jay Box on his retirement 
and to wish him many wonderful years 
to come.

TRIBUTE TO TOMMY TURNER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
when my friend Tommy Turner was 
first elected to lead LaRue County in 
1985, he was the youngest Kentuckian 
to ever serve as a county judge-execu-
tive. Now, 35 years later, Tommy re-
cently announced he would leave office 
as our Commonwealth’s longest cur-
rently serving county leader. Records 
bookend his service, and more accom-
plishments fill the years between. I 
would like to take a moment to con-
gratulate Tommy on his decades of 
leadership for LaRue County and to 
thank him for his many contributions 
to Kentucky. 
Every county judge-executive is re-
sponsible for local services such as the 
county’s budget and road maintenance. 
As LaRue County’s leader, however, 
Tommy was given an additional—al-
most sacred—charge. He helped pre-
serve the birthplace of our most fa-
mous Kentuckian, Abraham Lincoln. 
Tommy took seriously his role in hon-
oring Lincoln, and Kentucky will con-
tinue to benefit from his enthusiasm 
for our Nation’s 16th President. 
Along with a group of motivated citi-
zens, Tommy helped establish the Lin-
coln Museum in Hodgenville. In a typ-
ical year, thousands of tourists will 
visit the museum and the nearby Abra-
ham Lincoln National Historical Park. 
Tommy championed an effort to ex-
pand the National Park by coordi-
nating a donation to include Lincoln’s 
Boyhood Home on Knob Creek. This 
year, 
Kentucky 
Living 
Magazine 
named the Lincoln Museum as the 
Commonwealth’s Best Museum, a well- 
deserved distinction for their efforts to 
safeguard the Great Emancipator’s leg-
acy. 
In 2000, Congress created the Abra-
ham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission 
to prepare national celebrations for the 
President’s 
200th 
birthday. 
Rec-
ommended by Kentucky’s Governor at 
the time and appointed by the Presi-
dent, Tommy was a fine choice to serve 
as a commissioner. Hodgenville would 
later host the celebration’s National 
Opening Ceremony and lead the coun-
try in honoring President Lincoln. 
Over the years, I have worked with 
Tommy to preserve Lincoln’s heritage 
in LaRue County and to deliver for the 
community’s bright future. It has also 
been a privilege to join Tommy’s radio 
show to speak directly with local fami-
lies about their priorities and my work 
for Kentucky in the Senate. 
Tommy spent half of his life as 
LaRue County’s judge-executive. The 
results of his leadership can be seen 
across the county in its growth and op-
portunity. I would like to encourage 
my Senate colleagues to join me in 
thanking Tommy for his service and 
for preserving the memory of one of 
our 
country’s 
greatest 
leaders. 
In 
whatever comes next for Tommy, I 
wish him the best. I look forward to his 
continued contributions to our great 
Commonwealth.

SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
Mrs. Kelly Loeffler, of Georgia, rejects 
the assertion by Mr. CHUCK SCHUMER, 
of New York, that there is no precedent 
for a Supreme Court justice being con-
firmed after July 1 in a Presidential 
election year. 
In fact on three separate occasions, a 
duly-elected President appointed and 
the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court 
justice in a Presidential election year: 
John Hessin Clarke: confirmed by the 
Senate on July 24, 1916; George Shiras, 
Jr.: confirmed by the Senate on July 
26, 1892; and Melville Fuller: confirmed 
by the Senate on July 20, 1888. 
The Constitution does not limit the 
President’s nomination powers during 
the fourth year of his term.

NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS 
WEEK 
Mr. 
CARDIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today I thank the 30 million small 
businesses in America for their con-
tributions to our economy during this 
year’s National Small Business Week, 
which began on Sunday, September 20 
and ends on Saturday, September 26. 
National Small Business Week is the 
time of year when we come together to 
celebrate our Nation’s small businesses 
for their role in moving our economy 
forward by boosting local economies, 
improving industries through innova-
tion, and employing nearly half of our 
country’s workforce. 
Taking time to recognize our Na-
tion’s small businesses is especially 
important this year due to the many 
ways—big and small—that our small 
businesses have stepped up to help our 
communities get through the pan-
demic. 
In my home State of Maryland, I 
have seen distilleries use their facili-
ties to make hand sanitizer when sup-
plies were low; I have seen lacrosse 
equipment manufacturers produce face 
shields and masks for doctors and first 
responders; and I have heard stories 
about the many small government con-
tractors that are helping Federal agen-
cies address COVID–19. Today I am 
proud to recognize the founder of one 
of those small government contractors, 
Dr. Anton Bizzell, who has been named 
Maryland Small Business Person of the 
Year by the Small Business Adminis-
tration. 
Dr. Bizzell’s company, the Bizzell 
Group, is an 8(a) certified small busi-
ness that specializes in strategy and 
technology and works at the forefront 
of public health issues. Most recently, 
the Bizzell Group has been helping the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention keep our communities aware of 
the latest information regarding the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
After more than 25 years of experi-
ence in health services, policy, and 
management, Dr. Bizzell founded the 
Bizzell Group in 2010 to provide data- 
driven and innovative solutions to cli-
ents in an effort to build healthy, se-
cure, and connected communities. In 
the years since, the company has 
grown to include nearly 100 employees 
with four offices in Lanham, Rockville, 
Atlanta, GA, and the Democratic Re-
public of the Congo. 
Dr. Bizzell has said, ‘‘Business is 
most successful when done with integ-
rity, excellence, and heart, and success 
is when your end result makes the 
world a better place.’’ His philosophy is 
clearly at work at the Bizzell Group. 
Dr. Bizzell and the Bizzell Group are 
a shining example of the vital role 
small businesses and entrepreneurs 
play in our communities. In addition to 
the more than 100 jobs created by the 
Bizzell Group, Dr. Bizzell serves on the 
Maryland Board for the March of 
Dimes, and he is president of the Delta 
Lambda Chapter of the Alpha Phi 
Alpha Fraternity. 
I congratulate Dr. Bizzell for being 
named Maryland’s Small Business Per-
son of the Year, and I thank him and 
his colleagues at the Bizzell Group for 
their efforts to keep our communities 
informed about COVID–19 during this 
unprecedented public health crisis. I 
am proud to represent them in the U.S. 
Senate. 
Now more than ever, these contribu-
tions to our economy and communities 
deserve to be recognized. Dr. Bizzel and 
the many small business owners like 
him in communities across the nation 
are why I will continue to fight for 
Congress to pass another economic re-
lief bill that meets the needs of our 
communities and small businesses. So 
many of our Nation’s small businesses 
have stepped up for us, and Congress 
must once again do the same for them.

TRIBUTE TO RHONDA ZIMMERMAN 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise today in celebration of Rhonda 
Zimmerman, the Boys and Girls Club 
of Central Wyoming’s 2020 honoree. 
Since 1978, the Boys and Girls Clubs 
of Central Wyoming has worked to 
make a positive difference in the lives 
of children. Their mission is to inspire 
all youth, especially those who need 
them the most. They strive to help 
young people reach their full potential 
as productive, responsible, and caring 
citizens. The programs, leagues, and 
activities serve the children in our 
community by cultivating academic 
success, healthy lifestyles, and good 
character and citizenship. 
On October 21, 2020, the Boys and 
Girls Club of Central Wyoming will 
host the 22nd Annual Awards and Rec-
ognition Breakfast. Every year at this 
event, the Boys and Girls Club honors a 
member of the community who has 
made 
outstanding 
contributions 
to 
their organization, Wyoming youth, 
and the city of Casper. It is an inspir-
ing celebration. 
This year’s honoree is Rhonda Zim-
merman. She is an ideal choice to re-
ceive this honor because of her lifelong 
dedication to our children and families. 
With this award, the Boys and Girls 
Club of Central Wyoming shows their 
gratitude for Rhonda’s work, which 
mirrors the Club’s important mission. 
Rhonda has given of her time and tal-
ents to the youth of our community for 
her entire life. Being raised in the Zim-
merman family, she was taught the 
value of hard work and giving back to 
others. She grew up in Casper, the old-
est of her siblings, Mitch, Michael, and 
Renee, and with her loving parents, 
Gail, Lois, and later Anne. Their char-
acter contributed greatly to Rhonda’s 
Christian values and giving nature. 
Rhonda attended Casper College, earn-
ing an associate’s degree in criminal 
justice and social work and later 
earned her bachelor’s degree in social 
work from the University of Wyoming 
at Casper College. 
Rhonda’s passion for her community 
and the well-being of her neighbors has 
shown time and again through her 
work as a counselor at the Youth Crisis 
Center, the Wyoming Behavioral Insti-
tute, and Central Wyoming Counseling 
Center. In 2011, Rhonda cofounded Cas-
per Family Connections. Their mission 
is to provide children who are unable 
to live with one or both parents a safe 
and conflict-free environment. They 
provide also for healthy contact with 
the noncustodial family. They offer 
parenting classes as well as mental 
health services on top of their impor-
tant mission, giving children and fami-
lies a strong foundation on which to 
build. 
Family holds a particularly special 
place in Rhonda’s life. She raised two 
children, Greg and Kendra. Together, 
Greg and Rhonda own and operate E&F 
Towing and Transport in Casper. She 
also serves on the Boys and Girls Clubs 
of Central Wyoming board of directors 
along with her brother Mitch. 
Rhonda sets an example everyone can 
follow. She is the first to offer a help-
ing hand and shows a passion for im-
proving the lives of others. The Code of 
the West charges us to live each day 
with courage. Not only does Rhonda 
embody this principle, but she gives ev-
eryone around her the tools they need 
to live the same. Wyoming, Casper, and 
the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wy-
oming are fortunate to have her. 
It is with great honor that I recog-
nize this outstanding member of our 
Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, 
joins me in extending our congratula-
tions to Rhonda Zimmerman upon her 
selection for this special award.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
HISTORIC ASHE HOSPITAL 
∑ Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I rise 
today to honor the achievements of the 
organizations and people who led the 
successful redevelopment of Historic 
Ashe Hospital in Jefferson, NC. This 
once abandoned property on the Na-
tional 
Register 
of 
Historic 
Places 
today provides 46 affordable homes for 
seniors, people with disabilities, and 
homeless individuals at a time when 
affordable housing is needed more than 
ever. 
This incredible property was devel-
oped through the use of the Low-In-
come Housing Tax Credit, known as 
the Housing Credit. In North Carolina 
and across the country, it is one of our 
most important tools in the fight to 
provide affordable housing for at-risk 
families in our communities. More 
than 87,000 North Carolina homes have 
been developed using the Housing Cred-
it, and more than 3 million homes na-
tionwide. They serve our low-income

seniors, veterans, disabled individuals, 
and working families. 
That is why I am pleased to an-
nounce that this important site has 
been recognized by the Affordable 
Housing Tax Credit Coalition as a 2020 
recipient of the Charles L. Edson Tax 
Credit Award, which recognizes excel-
lence in the affordable housing indus-
try and organizations that have dem-
onstrated the most impactful use of 
the Housing Credit. 
Historic Ashe Hospital in Jefferson is 
no exception. The historic building in-
cludes a community room for residents 
to gather, office space for those now 
working from home, a library for resi-
dents of all ages, and a memory room 
with artifacts from the original hos-
pital. Wide hallways, tall ceilings, and 
large windows remind residents of the 
great public spaces of the past and 
beautiful views of the Blue Ridge 
Mountains. 
Historic Ashe is also located across 
the street from the Appalachian Dis-
trict Health Department, which deliv-
ers services including case manage-
ment, skilled nursing, physical and oc-
cupational therapy, and respite care. 
Vaya Health of western North Carolina 
provides a variety of mental health 
services on-site, and other community 
partners provide GED classes to those 
interested, transportation to the local 
senior center, volunteer opportunities, 
and a variety of other education and 
support services. 
It is truly a monumental achieve-
ment in terms of creative property de-
velopment and the judicious use of pub-
lic and private funding to benefit the 
residents of Jefferson, while contrib-
uting to the Nation’s vital supply of af-
fordable housing. 
Several groups and individuals were 
instrumental in bringing the project to 
fruition, including Northwestern Hous-
ing Enterprises, Incorporated, Red-
stone Equity Partners, Foss & Com-
pany, 
Bank 
of 
Tennessee, 
Federal 
Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Tise- 
Kiester Architects of Chapel Hill, and 
notably E. G. ‘‘Ned’’ Fowler, President 
of Northwestern Housing Enterprises. 
To everyone involved in the develop-
ment of Historic Ashe Hospital for af-
fordable housing in Jefferson, I offer 
my congratulations and gratitude on 
behalf of the people of North Carolina. 
Thank you.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petition or memorial 
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as 
indicated: 
POM–242. A resolution adopted by the Gen-
eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey ex-
pressing its opposition to and disapproval of 
the United States Department of Housing 
and Urban Development’s proposed rule-
making 
revising 
its 
Affirmatively 
Fur-
thering Fair Housing rule adopted in 2015; to 
the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs. 
ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 112 
Whereas, In 2015, the United States Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development 
(‘‘HUD’’) adopted an Affirmatively Fur-
thering Fair Housing (‘‘AFFH’’) rule that es-
tablished a new framework for HUD funding 
recipients to meet their longstanding legal 
obligation under the federal Fair Housing 
Act to reduce barriers to fair housing and 
equal opportunity; and 
Whereas, The AFFH rule was promulgated 
in response to the recommendations of the 
United States Government Accountability 
Office and affected stakeholders centered on 
the need for HUD to bolster its fair housing 
planning obligations by providing greater 
clarity and support to HUD funding recipi-
ents and facilitating local decision-making 
on fair housing priorities and goals; and 
Whereas, The AFFH rule achieves these 
ends by providing clearer standards for meet-
ing fair housing obligations, greater trans-
parency, increased access to data concerning 
fair housing conditions and access to oppor-
tunity, and new mapping and customizable 
assessment tools, as well as by encouraging 
collaboration between jurisdictions and com-
munity input and participation; and 
Whereas, The AFFH rule ultimately serves 
to help HUD funding recipients take mean-
ingful actions to overcome historic patterns 
of segregation, promote fair housing choice, 
and foster inclusive communities that are 
free from discrimination; and 
Whereas, On August 9, 2018, HUD issued an 
advance notice of a proposed rulemaking 
that would undo much of the AFFH rule for 
the stated reasons that the rule impeded the 
development and rehabilitation of affordable 
housing and provided inadequate autonomy 
to HUD funding recipients; and 
Whereas, The AFFH rule has not been in 
effect long enough to adequately assess its 
effect on the development and rehabilitation 
of affordable housing, the rule does not in 
fact dictate how communities should meet 
their fair housing obligations, and the rule 
has produced concrete improvements in fair 
housing, such as the commitment of Chester 
County, Pennsylvania to reduce the number 
of Section 8 recipients living in high-poverty 
census tracts by five percentage points; and 
Whereas, It is altogether fitting, proper, 
and in the public interest, for this House to 
express opposition to HUD’s proposed rule-
making that would upend the AFFH rule and 
exacerbate housing inequities in both this 
State and across the United States; now, 
therefore, 
Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the 
State of New Jersey: 
1. This House expresses its opposition to 
and disapproval of the United States Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development’s 
proposed rulemaking revising its Affirma-
tively Furthering Fair Housing rule adopted 
in 2015. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the 
President and Vice President of the United 
States, the United States Secretary of Hous-
ing and Urban Development, and each mem-
ber of Congress elected from this State.

marrow and umbilical cord blood trans-
plantation. Over twenty-two million 
Americans are registered bone marrow 
donors resulting in nearly 6,500 trans-
plants just last year. In the years since 
NCBI 
was 
established, 
more 
than 
300,000 cord blood units have been col-
lected, facilitating more than 100,000 
blood 
stem 
cell 
transplants. 
The 
TRANSPLANT Act would reaffirm the 
commitment to these life-saving pro-
grams, which have been helping to con-
nect individuals in need of bone mar-
row or umbilical cord blood transplants 
with donors for more than two decades. 
The public registries, made up of do-
nors from all over the country, have 
been a true lifeline for the Americans 
who have found an unrelated match. 
By strengthening and enhancing the 
important programs operating these 
registries, many more Americans will 
be afforded the opportunity to find a 
match if they are ever in need. I look 
forward to swift consideration of this 
legislation in the Senate Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
and working toward passage in the full 
Senate.

TORIC ACHIEVEMENT 
Mr. INHOFE submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 713 
Whereas 
President 
Donald 
J. 
Trump, 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of 
Israel, and other world leaders have worked 
tirelessly to announce agreements on the 
full 
normalization 
of 
relations 
between 
Israel and other nations; 
Whereas the United Arab Emirates and the 
Kingdom of Bahrain have been the first Arab 
states to announce formal relations with 
Israel; 
Whereas, under the agreements, the two 
countries agree to the establishment of re-
ciprocal embassies and the exchange of Am-
bassadors; 
Whereas opening direct ties between Israel 
and the United Arab Emirates and between 
Israel and Bahrain could begin to transform 
the region by spurring economic growth, en-
hancing technological innovation, and forg-
ing closer people-to-people relations; 
Whereas these agreements could promote 
investment, tourism, direct flights, security, 
telecommunications, 
technology, 
energy, 
healthcare, culture, and the environment; 
Whereas the United States, Israel, the 
United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain share a 
commitment to promoting stability through 
diplomatic engagement, increased economic 
integration, and closer security coordina-
tion; 
Whereas Israel, the United Arab Emirates, 
and Bahrain will partner with the United 
States to launch a Strategic Agenda for the 
Middle East to expand diplomatic, trade, and 
security cooperation; 
Whereas these historic agreements could 
help advance peace between Israel and other 
Arab nations; 
Whereas 
these 
bilateral 
breakthroughs 
could set a precedent for further diplomatic 
openings throughout the region; 
Whereas support for peace between Israel 
and its neighbors has longstanding bipar-
tisan support in Congress and among the 
American people; and 
Whereas the agreements build upon the 
decades-long leadership of the United States 
in helping Israel broker peace treaties with 
Egypt and Jordan and promoting peace talks 
between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and the 
Palestinians: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the Governments and 
people of Israel and the United Arab Emir-
ates and the Governments and people of 
Israel and Bahrain on reaching their respec-
tive historic agreements; 
(2) encourages other Arab nations to estab-
lish full relations with Israel with the vision 
of realizing full peace between Israel and all 
of its Arab neighbors; and 
(3) urges the President to continue to en-
gage with the Government of Israel and the 
United States’ Arab partners in reaching 
these historic agreements.

Ms. DUCKWORTH (for herself, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. MERKLEY, Ms. WARREN, 
Mr. HEINRICH, Ms. HARRIS, Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN, and Mr. MARKEY) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Environ-
ment and Public Works: 
S. RES. 714 
Whereas access to clean water is a funda-
mental human right; 
Whereas the Federal Water Pollution Con-
trol Act (62 Stat. 1155, chapter 758) was en-
acted into law in 1948; 
Whereas the Federal Water Pollution Con-
trol Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92– 
500; 86 Stat. 816) were enacted with bipar-
tisan support and significantly reorganized 
and expanded the Federal Water Pollution 
Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (com-
monly known as and hereinafter referred to 
in this preamble as the ‘‘Clean Water Act’’); 
Whereas the Clean Water Act is one of the 
most important laws of the United States 
and the principal safeguard of the United 
States against unregulated pollution or de-
struction of surface waters of the United 
States; 
Whereas the objective of the Clean Water 
Act is to ‘‘restore and maintain the chem-
ical, physical, and biological integrity of the 
Nation’s waters’’; 
Whereas the Clean Water Act declared na-
tional goals of eliminating the discharge of 
pollutants into the waters of the United 
States by 1985 and, wherever attainable, en-
suring that waters were fishable and swim-
mable by 1983; 
Whereas the Clean Water Act provides 
strong and comprehensive requirements for 
the control of pollutants in the waters of the 
United States; 
Whereas the Clean Water Act authorizes 
Federal financial assistance for building and 
upgrading 
municipal 
sewage 
treatment 
plants and other types of water quality im-
provements projects; 
Whereas rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, wet-
lands, and other waters have enormous pub-
lic health, community welfare, economic, 
and ecological importance to the United 
States, considering that—

draw supply from headwater, intermittent, 
or ephemeral streams; 
(2) according to a report of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, streams provide 
the majority of water to most rivers and 
‘‘transport sediment, wood, organic matter, 
nutrients, chemical contaminants, and many 
of the organisms found in rivers’’; 
(3) chemical, physical, and biological proc-
esses in streams can convert nitrogen and 
other nutrients, preventing nitrogen and 
other nutrients from causing downstream 
harm; 
(4) wetlands prevent and minimize flooding 
by storing as much as between 1,000,000 and 
1,500,000 gallons of water for each acre of 
wetland; 
(5) wetlands and other waters in the flood 
plains of rivers and streams help prevent pol-
lution from reaching downstream waters; 
(6) 3⁄4 of fish harvested commercially de-
pend on wetlands; 
(7) the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention reported that ‘‘about 91 million peo-
ple over the age of 16 swim in oceans, lakes, 
and rivers each year in the United States’’; 
(8) approximately 37 percent of water with-
drawals, or 118,000,000,000 gallons of water 
withdrawals per day, are used for irrigation, 
and 52 percent of water withdrawals are 
taken from surface waters; 
(9) a recent study estimated that wetlands 
around the world provide ecosystem services 
like flood prevention and pollution filtration 
worth more than $47,000,000,000,000 per year; 
(10) fishing and other water sports con-
tribute $175,000,000,000 annually to the econ-
omy of the United States and support more 
than 1,500,000 jobs; 
(11) companies often need clean water in 
their industrial processes or as a component 
of their end product, such as craft beer brew-
ers that depend on a reliable source of clean 
water, add approximately $76,000,000,000 an-
nually to the economy of the United States, 
and support more than 500,000 jobs; 
(12) according to 1 study, the ecological 
restoration economy, which includes mitiga-
tion for harms to waters due to discharges of 
dredged or fill material, ‘‘directly employs 
126,000 workers and generates $9.5 billion in 
economic output’’ per year, which ‘‘supports 
an additional 95,000 jobs and $15 billion in 
economic output through indirect (business- 
to-business) linkages and increased house-
hold spending’’; 
(13) more than 318,000,000 individuals vis-
ited national parks in the United States in 
2018 to engage in recreation and be inspired 
by thundering waterfalls, streaming geysers, 
desert springs, ocean beaches, and jeweled 
lakes, generating $40,000,000,000 for the econ-
omy of the United States and more than 
330,000 private sector jobs; 
(14) the Environmental Protection Agency 
reports that the Great Lakes contain ‘‘84% of 
North America’s surface fresh water’’ and 
‘‘about 21% of the world’s supply of surface 
fresh water’’; 
(15) restoring and protecting the Great 
Lakes and their tributaries also protects the 
$6,000,000,000,000 regional economy of the 
Great Lakes and the 1,500,000 jobs and 
$62,000,000,000 in wages directly connected to 
the Great Lakes; and 
(16) the Great Lakes and their tributaries 
facilitate nearly $16,000,000,000 in annual 
spending by residents and the 37,000,000 hunt-
ers, anglers, bird watchers, and other tour-
ists who visit the region for recreation; 
Whereas water pollution and the loss of 
water resources can cause catastrophic harm 
to the health and economic strength of com-
munities, evidenced by the fact that— 
(1) in 2014, a harmful algal bloom in west-
ern Lake Erie prompted a 3-day shutdown of 
the drinking water supply of Toledo, Ohio, 
affecting approximately 500,000 individuals; 
(2) a spill of a toxic chemical into the Elk 
River in Charleston, West Virginia, caused a 
cutoff of drinking water for approximately 
300,000 individuals for several days; 
(3) outbreaks of blue-green algae and red 
tide in Florida have caused widespread harm 
to businesses and have killed a substantial 
number of aquatic animals over multiple 
years, with the effects of the outbreaks in 
2018 being particular severe; 
(4) in 2008, the coal ash waste pit of the 
Tennessee Valley Authority near Kingston, 
Tennessee, experienced a mammoth struc-
tural 
failure 
and 
released 
more 
than 
1,000,000,000 tons of waste into the Emory and 
Clinch Rivers, and a 2019 analysis found that 
similar pits around the country routinely 
leak and contaminate nearby groundwater 
and surface waters; 
(5) beaches in multiple States, including 
Mississippi, New Jersey, Washington, and 
New York, were forced to close due to out-
breaks of algae that are commonly fueled by 
nitrogen and phosphorus pollution; 
(6) intense flooding is occurring in places 
like Houston, Texas, where wetland destruc-
tion is believed to be contributing to the se-
verity of the flooding; and 
(7) many areas of the United States are ex-
pected to experience worsened drought con-
ditions with climate change, making the 
preservation of water resources more crit-
ical; 
Whereas the Clean Water Act dramatically 
slowed the rate of wetlands loss in the 
United States from more 500,000 acres annu-
ally in the 1950s to approximately 80,000 
acres annually in the late 1990s; 
Whereas the quality of numerous water 
bodies has substantially improved since the 
adoption of the Clean Water Act, including 
the Charles River in Massachusetts, the 
Chesapeake Bay, and the Great Lakes; 
Whereas, 
despite 
the 
improvements 
brought about by the Clean Water Act, the 
United States still faces major water re-
source and pollution challenges, evidenced 
by the fact that— 
(1) according to the most recent State data 
submitted to the Environmental Protection 
Agency— 
(A) 53 percent of assessed rivers and 
streams do not meet 1 or more water qual-
ity standards, which are established to en-
sure waters are clean enough for specific 
uses like fishing and swimming; 
(B) 71 percent of assessed lakes, res-
ervoirs, and ponds are impaired; 
(C) 80 percent of assessed bays and estu-
aries are impaired; and 
(D) 72 percent of assessed coastal shore-
line waters are impaired; and 
(2) the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention published a report stating that the 
increasing frequency of harmful algal blooms 
is associated with increasing temperatures 
and levels of nutrients in waters of the 
United States; 
Whereas the 2017 Infrastructure Report 
Card of the American Society of Civil Engi-
neers gave the wastewater infrastructure of 
the United States a grade of D+; 
Whereas the most recent Clean Watersheds 
Needs Survey report to Congress identified 
not less than $271,000,000,000 worth of capital 
needs for wastewater, storm water, and other 
clean water infrastructure; 
Whereas the condition of the waters of the 
United States consistently ranks as one of 
the most acute environmental worries of in-
dividuals in the United States, with 80 per-
cent of respondents in a March 2019 Gallup 
Poll indicating that they worry a great deal 
or a fair amount about the pollution of riv-
ers, lakes, and reservoirs; 
Whereas the United States Commission on 
Civil Rights recommended further study and 
analysis of Federal laws, including the Clean 
Water Act, to analyze gaps in civil rights 
protections and found that the ‘‘EPA’s defi-
nition of environmental justice recognizes 
environmental justice as a civil right, fair 
treatment and meaningful involvement of all 
people regardless of race, color, national ori-
gin, or income with respect to the develop-
ment, implementation, and enforcement of 
environmental laws, regulations and poli-
cies’’; 
Whereas the United States Geological Sur-
vey conducted limited monitoring of 17 
perfluoroalkyl 
and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
sub-
stances (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘PFAS’’) in source and treated public water 
supplies from 25 drinking water facilities and 
found PFAS in all source water and public 
water supply samples collected; 
Whereas a study led by Harvard University 
researchers found that the drinking water 
supplies for not less than 6,000,000 individuals 
in the United States exceed the health advi-
sory of the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy for 2 PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (com-
monly 
referred 
to 
as 
‘‘PFOA’’) 
and 
perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (commonly re-
ferred to as ‘‘PFOS’’), and more recent infor-
mation indicates that more comprehensive 
monitoring would find that the drinking 
water of many times more than 6,000,000 in-
dividuals in the United States contains 
PFAS at levels that pose significant health 
hazards; 
Whereas the Environmental Protection 
Agency has initiated numerous administra-
tive actions that collectively would evis-
cerate the protections of the Clean Water 
Act and other safeguards for clean water, in-
cluding— 
(1) repealing science-based protections for 
streams, wetlands, and other waters and the 
exclusion of millions of miles of streams and 
tens of millions of acres of wetlands from the 
pollution control programs of the Clean 
Water Act; 
(2) 
easing 
restrictions 
on 
wastewater 
plants, authorizing the plants to release par-
tially treated sewage during rainstorms; 
(3) refusing to develop regulations man-
dated by the Clean Water Act aimed at 
avoiding and minimizing spills of hazardous 
substances; 
(4) weakening rules relating to the siting, 
operating, monitoring, and closing of pits 
where coal ash and other coal combustion 
waste is dumped; 
(5) exempting polluters who harm water-
ways from the penalties of the Clean Water 
Act if their discharge first travels through 
groundwater from the discharge permitting 
program of the Clean Water Act; 
(6) restricting the authority of experts 
from the Environmental Protection Agency 
under the Clean Water Act to stop dumping 
projects that cause unacceptable harms to 
water bodies; 
(7) delaying and weakening toxic pollution 
discharge limits for power plants; and 
(8) curtailing the rights of States and Trib-
al nations under the Clean Water Act to re-
view federally-permitted projects and impose 
conditions on or reject a project, as appro-
priate, to prevent harm to their waterways; 
Whereas the United States remains far 
from achieving the objective of the Clean 
Water Act by putting critical resources that 
provide enormous value to the United States 
at risk; and 
Whereas the proposed actions of the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency would sub-
stantially worsen the risk to critical re-
sources: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate encourages the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency to— 
(1) maintain and strengthen, rather than 
attack, requirements that keep waterways of 
the United States clean;

Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. 
VAN HOLLEN, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. HEIN-
RICH, and Mr. WHITEHOUSE) submitted 
the following concurrent resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Environment and Public Works: 
S. CON. RES. 47 
Whereas a stable climate system at the 
founding of the United States allowed human 
life and human civilization to flourish; 
Whereas the United States was founded on 
the deeply rooted principle of securing ‘‘the 
Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our 
Posterity’’; 
Whereas the Constitution of the United 
States protects the fundamental rights to 
life, liberty, property, and equal protection 
of the laws; 
Whereas a climate system capable of sus-
taining human life— 
(1) is fundamental to a free and ordered so-
ciety; and 
(2) is preservative of fundamental rights, 
including the rights to life, liberty, property, 
personal security, family autonomy, bodily 
integrity, and the ability to learn, practice, 
and transmit cultural and religious tradi-
tions; 
Whereas the Federal Government sets the 
energy policy of the United States, which 
has resulted in a national energy system in 
which approximately 80 percent of the en-
ergy in the United States comes from fossil 
fuels; 
Whereas the national fossil fuel-based en-
ergy system has led to carbon dioxide emis-
sions from the United States constituting 
more than 1⁄4 of cumulative global carbon di-
oxide emissions; 
Whereas the United States is the largest 
producer of oil and gas in the world, due in 
substantial part to the Federal Govern-
ment— 
(1) opening up Federal public land and 
water for fossil fuel extraction; and 
(2) actively supporting fossil fuel energy; 
Whereas there is an overwhelming sci-
entific consensus that— 
(1) human-caused climate change is occur-
ring; and 
(2) the rate of global heating and ocean 
acidification as of September 2020 is a result 
of the buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gas 
emissions, primarily carbon dioxide emis-
sions, largely from the combustion of fossil 
fuels; 
Whereas atmospheric carbon dioxide levels 
of over 400 parts per million as of September 
2020 have caused a dangerous planetary en-
ergy imbalance, equivalent to the quantity 
of energy of exploding more than 400,000 
atomic bombs of the kind dropped on Hiro-
shima, Japan, per day, 365 days per year, 
across the planet; 
Whereas the latest climate science and 
real-world observations of that energy im-
balance demonstrate that the approximately 
1 degree Celsius of warming that has already 
occurred as a result of human-caused cli-
mate change is already dangerous and nega-
tively affecting all aspects of society and the 
economy of the United States; 
Whereas the last time that atmospheric 
concentrations of carbon dioxide were over 
400 parts per million— 
(1) the seas were 70 to 90 feet higher; 
(2) Greenland had no ice; and 
(3) coral reefs suffered a major extinction; 
Whereas similar conditions will result if 
the United States does not drastically reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions and naturally se-
quester excess concentrations of atmos-
pheric carbon dioxide during the 21st cen-
tury; 
Whereas climate change is a threat to na-
tional security, as climate change contrib-
utes to and exacerbates global instability 
and conflict; 
Whereas the generation of today’s children 
was born into a climate system made haz-
ardous to their health and well-being be-
cause of human-caused climate change; 
Whereas children are uniquely vulnerable 
to human-caused climate change because of 
their developing bodies, higher exposure to 
air, food, and water per unit of body weight, 
unique behavior patterns, dependence on 
caregivers, and longevity on the planet; 
Whereas human-caused climate change is a 
public health emergency that is adversely 
impacting the physical and mental health of 
children through— 
(1) extreme weather events; 
(2) rising temperatures and increased heat 
exposure; 
(3) decreased air quality; 
(4) altered infectious disease patterns; 
(5) food and water insecurity; and 
(6) other effects; 
Whereas infant mortality increases 25 per-
cent on extremely hot days, with the first 7 
days of life representing a period of critical 
vulnerability; 
Whereas heat illness is a leading cause of 
death and illness in high school athletes, 
with nearly 10,000 episodes of heat illness oc-
curring annually; 
Whereas 8.4 percent of children suffer from 
allergic rhinitis, and the ragweed pollen sea-
son in North America has grown 13 to 27 days 
longer since 1995 due to higher temperatures 
and greater atmospheric carbon dioxide lev-
els; 
Whereas children exposed to wildfires suf-
fer substantial— 
(1) eye symptoms; and 
(2) upper and lower respiratory symptoms 
that lead to increased rates of asthma-re-
lated hospitalizations and emergency room 
visits; 
Whereas extreme weather events can nega-
tively impact the mental health of children 
due to— 
(1) family loss or separation; 
(2) school interruption; 
(3) scarcities of food, water, and shelter; 
and

Whereas further increases in global tem-
perature will saddle children with an enor-
mous, perhaps incalculable, cost burden, un-
dermining their economic security and the 
economic security of the United States; 
Whereas children are deserving of special 
consideration and protection with respect to 
human-caused climate change; 
Whereas children on the frontlines of 
human-caused climate change across the 
United States and globally have risen up and 
called upon government leaders around the 
world to take concrete, science-based, and 
equitable action— 
(1) 
to 
address 
human-caused 
climate 
change; and 
(2) to ensure climate justice for their gen-
eration, future generations, and frontline 
and vulnerable communities, including com-
munities of color, low-income communities, 
and indigenous peoples; 
Whereas global atmospheric carbon dioxide 
concentrations must be reduced to below 350 
parts per million by the end of the 21st cen-
tury, with further reductions thereafter, to 
restore the energy balance of the planet, sta-
bilize the climate system, and protect the 
ice sheets and oceans for posterity; 
Whereas existing and future adverse public 
health and other impacts and costs to chil-
dren and the United States can be signifi-
cantly mitigated if the United States acts 
promptly to reduce emissions from fossil 
fuels in the United States; 
Whereas numerous experts have concluded 
that there are multiple technically and eco-
nomically feasible pathways to place all sec-
tors of the economy of the United States on 
an emissions-reduction path consistent with 
returning global atmospheric carbon dioxide 
to 350 parts per million by 2100; 
Whereas producing energy in the United 
States with noncarbon-emitting sources will 
result in energy costs within the range of re-
cent experience, ultimately saving con-
sumers money and stabilizing the cost of en-
ergy, while increasing the number of jobs in 
the energy sector; and 
Whereas multiple Federal departments and 
agencies can exercise authority delegated by 
Congress to prevent and respond to climate 
change, including— 
(1) the Department of Energy; 
(2) the Department of the Interior; 
(3) the Department of Agriculture; 
(4) the Environmental Protection Agency; 
(5) the Department of Commerce; and 
(6) the Department of State: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That it is the sense 
of Congress that— 
(1) renewed leadership by the United States 
is needed immediately to address the human- 
caused climate crisis that is disproportion-
ately affecting the health, economic oppor-
tunity, and fundamental rights of the chil-
dren of the United States; and 
(2) there is a human-caused climate crisis 
that— 
(A) has inspired children across the United 
States to organize and demand immediate 
government action to protect their funda-
mental rights from the perils of climate 
change; and 
(B) demands a national, comprehensive, 
science-based, and just climate recovery plan 
that— 
(i) is prepared by Federal departments and 
agencies pursuant to delegated authority 
over energy and climate policy; and 
(ii) to uphold the fundamental rights of 
children, puts the United States on a trajec-
tory consistent with reducing global atmos-
pheric carbon dioxide to below 350 parts per 
million by 2100.

SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
want to say how much I appreciate 
your staying late this evening for this. 
Last night, I had the chance to speak 
about the late Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, somebody who, as much as 
anyone in our history, advanced the 
cause of equality between men and 
women. When President Clinton named

September 23, 2020 
her to the Supreme Court, she had al-
ready 
transformed 
American 
law 
through her trailblazing work as a pro-
fessor and litigator. It is why her nomi-
nation sailed through this body with 96 
votes—a reminder of a time not so very 
long ago when the Senate understood 
its constitutional duty to advise and 
consent, when a qualified judge would 
get the vast majority of Senators to 
vote for that person. Every single time 
we did that, we reestablished the idea 
that the judiciary is independent— 
independent from what hopefully are 
temporary, insane partisan battles. 
After earning that 96 votes, for more 
than a quarter century on the Court, 
Justice Ginsburg authored rulings that 
promoted fairness, advanced equality, 
and secured hard-won rights. They 
upheld affirmative action and pro-
tected a woman’s right to choose. At 
the same time, she could never accept 
a decision that nullified our right to 
vote or otherwise limited our demo-
cratic values, even when it was hard 
for some of her colleagues on the high-
est Court in the land to perceive the 
systemic racism in our country. 
As I said last night, because the 
young Joan Ruth Bader knew America 
would be worse off without her, with-
out her talent, Justice Ginsburg fought 
hard to make America more demo-
cratic, more fair, and more free. Unfor-
tunately, the same cannot be said of 
the majority leader of this body who 
now seeks to ram a replacement 
through the Senate. As a Senator and 
as a majority leader, he dedicated his 
career to undo the work of Justice 
Ginsburg and those who have fought 
beside her for a better America. 
Pick almost any issue—from the deg-
radation of our courts and our democ-
racy to the sorry state of our govern-
ment’s fiscal condition—and for dec-
ades, you will find the majority lead-
er’s fingerprints all over the crime 
scene. 
Let’s start with the courts; that 
seems an appropriate place to start 
today. Justice Ginsburg cared deeply 
about what she called public respect 
for a confidence in the judiciary. No 
one in America has done more to de-
stroy that confidence and respect than 
the Senator from Kentucky. 
I first came to Washington as Colo-
rado’s 
Senator 
during 
President 
Obama’s first term. The majority lead-
er, who was then the minority leader, 
MITCH MCCONNELL from Kentucky, led 
the blockade against virtually all of 
President Obama’s nominees. He fili-
bustered the nominee for Secretary of 
Defense who was a Republican. In the 
history of the country, no nominee to 
be Secretary of Defense was filibus-
tered. From George Washington to 
George W. Bush, Senators had used the 
filibuster against 68 Presidential nomi-
nees; from Washington to Bush, that 
entire period, there were 68 filibusters 
of Presidential nominees. 
During President Obama’s first 5 
years, Republican Senators, led by 
MITCH MCCONNELL, used it against 79 
nominees. In 5 years of a brand-new 
President, they used the filibuster 
more times than in our history going 
back to George Washington. 
The obstruction was relentless. It fi-
nally led Senate Democrats to change 
the rules in 2013 with the so-called nu-
clear option, allowing us to confirm ju-
dicial nominees, except for the Su-
preme Court and other executive ap-
pointments, with 51 votes instead of 60 
votes. I am sorry about that vote. 
I have apologized on this floor before 
about that vote. It has led us partly to 
where we are today. After Republicans 
won a majority in this body, Senator 
MCCONNELL made his prior obstruction 
look like a game of beanbag. He wasn’t 
in the minority anymore. Now, he was 
in the majority. 
The next low point came on February 
13, 2016. I will never forget it. I was 
speaking at the Jefferson-Jackson Day 
dinner in Colorado when I saw the 
crawl come on CNN announcing the 
death of Justice Scalia. It was a Presi-
dential election year, and there were 
342 days to go before the end of Presi-
dent Obama’s second term—a term 
made possible by the American people 
deciding, once again, to hire, to give 
him the power to appoint people to the 
Supreme Court. Let the people decide. 
One hour after Chief Justice Roberts 
confirmed 
Scalia’s 
death, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL declared the American peo-
ple should have a voice in the selection 
of their next Supreme Court Justice; 
therefore, this vacancy should not be 
filled until we have a new President. 
That is not what the Constitution says. 
When there is a vacancy, the President 
shall nominate, and the Senate shall 
advise and consent. Today, we have a 
Senate with this majority that is not 
even interested in advising. As we 
stand here tonight, they have given 
their consent without even knowing 
who the nominee is going to be. 
Hoping cooler heads would prevail, 
President Obama nominated Merrick 
Garland, someone a Republican Senate 
had previously confirmed with 76 votes 
and whom the former Republican Sen-
ator from Utah, my friend Orrin Hatch, 
once called ‘‘a consensus nominee for 
the Supreme Court.’’ 
I have known Merrick Garland for a 
quarter of a century. I worked for him 
fresh out of law school when both of us 
served in the Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral’s office at the Department of Jus-
tice. I have never heard another lawyer 
or anyone, for that matter, refer to 
Garland without the highest admira-
tion. He set the standard for excel-
lence. He was a lawyer’s lawyer. 
Senate Republicans, led by the ma-
jority leader, refused to even meet with 
Judge Garland, let alone give him the 
courtesy of a hearing so the American 
people could see what an outstanding 
person he was, how brilliant and fair- 
minded he was. The majority leader 
would go on to say about this disgrace-
ful moment in our democracy’s history 
that ‘‘One of my proudest moments 
was when I looked Barack Obama in 
the eye and said, ‘Mr. President, you 
will not fill this Supreme Court va-
cancy.’ ’’ 
We know what happened next. We are 
still living in ‘‘next.’’ For the rest of 
2016, the majority leader held the seat 
open all year, 342 days with no hear-
ings, no meetings, no vote. One of the 
Senators in this body went home—I 
was proud they went home and said: 
I am never going to vote for Merrick Gar-
land, but I think it is wrong for us not to 
have a vote. We should have a vote. I should 
go home and explain why I voted the way I 
voted and have to defend my vote. 
Two days later, a super PAC run by a 
former clerk of Justice Scalia started 
to threaten they would run a primary 
against him if he didn’t change his 
mind, and he did. We know what hap-
pened. 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL kept the 
seat open. He helped elect Donald 
Trump who ran for office waving 
around a list of judges that he would 
appoint to the court and made Donald 
Trump, of all people, the first Presi-
dent in American history with the 
power to fill every judicial vacancy 
with a simple majority vote because 
Senator MCCONNELL later used the nu-
clear option to change the rules again 
without really having any debate here. 
As a result, he has used that power to 
confirm 217 judges. Nearly a quarter of 
the Federal bench are now Trump ap-
pointees. 
In 2017, Senator MCCONNELL
deto-
nated his own nuclear option to lower 
the required votes for Supreme Court 
Justices from 60 to 51, as he warned—in 
fairness to him—as he warned he would 
do. He installed Neil Gorsuch in what 
should have been Garland’s seat. In 
2018, he jammed through the nomina-
tion of Judge Kavanaugh under his new 
regime, delivering the confirmation by 
a margin of two votes, the narrowest 
margin for a Supreme Court nominee 
since 1881. 
Throughout it all, he seated a roster 
of judges across the Federal bench who 
otherwise could not make the ‘‘B’’ 
team. The Senate confirmed a judge 
who opposed the State proclamation 
honoring an association of professional 
women because it had dared to talk 
about glass ceilings and pay equity. 
The Senate confirmed a lawyer who 
wrote blog posts peddling conspiracies 
about Barack Obama and comparing 
abortion to slavery; an attorney who 
suggested judges can ignore judicial 
precedence they deem incorrect and 
who justified denying habeas corpus to 
enemy combatants with the brutal an-
cient dictum: In times of war, the laws 
are silent. 
Then the Senate confirmed its first- 
ever nominee rated ‘‘Not Qualified’’ by 
the American Bar Association. It had 
never happened before in American his-
tory. But once was not enough. The 
Senate went on to approve six more 
Trump nominees rated ‘‘Not Qualified’’ 
by the ABA. You can’t find qualified 
lawyers? You can’t find a lawyer who 
can 
just—not 
even 
exceeds—just

meets? These people are unqualified. 
What qualifies them is many of them 
are in their thirties and are going to be 
on the courts for my lifetime. 
I thought that was all rock bottom. 
Then last Friday, 1 hour after we 
learned of Justice Ginsburg’s passing, 
the majority leader issued a press re-
lease saying: ‘‘President Trump’s nomi-
nee will receive a vote on the floor of 
the United States Senate.’’ That is the 
opposite of what he sent out when Jus-
tice Scalia died. 
When the majority leader blocked 
Judge Garland, when he said the Amer-
ican people should have a voice in the 
selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice, there were 342 days left in 
President Obama’s term—342. There 
are 119 days left in President Trump’s 
term, and there are 41 days left before 
this election. 
Here is what the history really is, not 
the masquerade that the majority lead-
er has been engaging in with the Amer-
ican people: From the founding of this 
country until today, we have had nine 
Supreme Court vacancies arise in the 
first 6 months of a Presidential elec-
tion year. Nine vacancies have arisen 
in the first 6 months of a Presidential 
election year. The Senate confirmed 
every single one of them, except 
Merrick Garland. The Senate has never 
confirmed a Supreme Court nominee 
this close to a Presidential election, 
never in the history of America. 
Now, we have given our consent, ap-
parently, before we even know who the 
nominee is. Because of Donald Trump’s 
magical powers, we are willing to 
somehow take it on faith. But these 
traditions make no difference to the 
majority leader. Thanks to him, we 
now live in a world where confirming 
judges has become one more vicious 
partisan exercise, where confirmation 
votes will now break on party lines for 
the foreseeable future—and, perhaps, 
forever—and where every ruling a Jus-
tice makes is going to be viewed as 
that is what we would expect from an 
Obama judge, that is what we would 
expect from a Trump-appointed judge. 
It is the opposite of the way this 
worked when I was in law school. 
The majority leader says: I am just 
putting it back to the days before we 
had a filibuster of circuit court judges 
because now there is no filibuster when 
it comes to Justices or judges. It is not 
accurate, and it is not right because, in 
those days, if you were qualified, you 
would get 96 votes like Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg got and like Justice Scalia 
got. I think he got 95 votes. Yet now we 
have exported the vicious partisanship 
out of this Chamber and into the high-
est Court of the land. 
Senator MCCONNELL
has not only 
damaged the integrity of our courts— 
something the late Justice Ginsburg 
cared deeply about—but he has also 
worked to sabotage her legacy of an 
America that is more democratic, more 
fair, and more free. 
Over his 36 years in office, the major-
ity leader has voted against nearly 
every piece of legislation that has pro-
moted equality and advanced civil 
rights. Again and again, he has voted 
against banning discrimination based 
on someone’s sexual orientation, pros-
ecuting hate crimes, and improving eq-
uity in the workplace. He even voted 
against 
reauthorizing 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act. More than anyone 
in America—and I say he is actually 
proud of this—he is responsible for ex-
posing our democracy to a deluge of 
money, special interests, and foreign 
interference. 
The 
majority 
leader 
has 
voted 
against every major campaign finance 
reform bill that has come to this floor. 
In fact, he led the fight against the bi-
partisan reform bill that was written 
by the late Senator John McCain, and 
when he failed to stop it in the Senate, 
Senator MCCONNELL went to the courts 
to have it overturned, paving the way 
years later for the disastrous ruling in 
Citizens United, which has allowed bil-
lionaires to flood our political system 
in the name of free speech when aver-
age working people are being drowned 
out. 
He voted against the bipartisan Na-
tional Voter Registration Act, which 
allowed people to register to vote when 
they got their driver’s licenses. 
Ahead of the 2016 elections, he re-
fused to join President Obama and 
issue a bipartisan statement to alert 
the American people to the threat of 
Russian interference in our elections. 
He refused to do it, and the American 
people didn’t know until after the elec-
tion was over that Vladimir Putin was 
putting his thumb on the scale. To this 
day, he refuses to let us vote on bipar-
tisan bills to protect our elections from 
foreign interference or even bills to 
fully fund our elections so that people 
can vote safely in the middle of a pan-
demic. 
There is only one person who gets to 
decide whether we vote on something 
around here, and he is the majority 
leader. I would like to see which Sen-
ators would vote against protecting 
our 
elections 
from 
Russian 
inter-
ference. I would like to see it, but we 
can’t know because he won’t allow it to 
come here for a vote. I would like to 
see who in this Chamber actually is 
against universal background checks, 
something we haven’t been able to take 
a vote on because the majority leader 
won’t allow a vote. 
Come out and vote. 
It has been over 570 days since the 
House passed the For the People Act, a 
bill that would ban gerrymandering, 
expand early voting, create automatic 
voter registration, and make election 
day a national holiday, among other 
reforms. The majority leader refuses to 
bring it to a vote. He called it a power 
grab. That is the Orwellian language 
that he uses. The only power grab that 
is, is a power grab by the American 
people to try to pry a little bit of 
power away from the majority leader 
from Kentucky on behalf of himself. 
I am not sure any majority leader in 
our history has had this low of regard 
for our democracy and for our institu-
tions than the Senator and, I would 
say, less regard for the American peo-
ple as well, because every time he has 
taken a knife to our institutions, he is 
in front of the cameras, talking about 
what an institutionalist he is. 
When he became majority leader, he 
said his first priority would be to ‘‘re-
store the Senate to the place our 
Founders, in their wisdom, had in-
tended, not the hollow shell’’—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator will suspend. 
Rule XIX, paragraph 2, provides that 
no Senator in debate shall, directly or 
indirectly, by any form of words im-
pute to another Senator or to other 
Senators any conduct or motive unwor-
thy or unbecoming a Senator. 
The Senator may proceed. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
was interrupted, but let me go back. 
When he became majority leader, he 
said the first priority would be to ‘‘re-
store the Senate to the place the 
Founders, in their wisdom, had in-
tended, not the hollow shell of the in-
stitution [Harry Reid had created].’’ 
Harry Reid was his predecessor. I 
think I remember him being on the 
floor, calling Harry Reid the worst ma-
jority leader that had ever existed in 
history. I don’t think he was sanc-
tioned for that. 
He promised ‘‘to open up the legisla-
tive process in a way that allows more 
amendments from both sides.’’ 
Last year, we voted on 26 amend-
ments. In the entire year last year, we 
voted on 26 amendments. Only eight of 
those amendments passed, and I think 
Senator PAUL, of Kentucky, had four of 
those amendments. 
Sometimes it’s going to mean [actually] 
working more often. Sometimes it’s going to 
mean working late, but restoring the Senate 
is the right thing to do. 
We are not working late around here. 
He said we were going to work on Fri-
days. Half the time, when Harry Reid 
was the majority leader, I couldn’t go 
home until Friday. Since the majority 
leader has been here, I have been home 
for dinner every Thursday night. 
He said we need to recommit to what 
he called a rational, functioning appro-
priations 
process. 
This 
year, 
we 
haven’t passed a single appropriations 
bill in the Senate. Last year, we had 
the longest government shutdown in 
American history. 
‘‘We need to return to regular order,’’ 
he said. This is from the majority lead-
er who put a bill on the floor to strip 
healthcare from 16 million Americans, 
a bill we didn’t even see until a few 
hours before the vote. There are so 
many of these things that we don’t 
even remember them anymore. He 
claims to be an institutionalist, but he 
has brought this institution to the low-
est it has been. 
It is no different than his claim to 
being a fiscal conservative. I have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5841 
September 23, 2020 
called it ‘‘the transcendent issue of our 
era.’’ 
He said, ‘‘Until we fix that problem 
[the deficit], we can’t fix America.’’ 
He said Americans are ‘‘tired of the 
spending, debt and government take-
overs’’ and complained that our debt 
‘‘makes us look a lot like Greece.’’ 
He claims to be a fiscal hawk—he has 
done it his entire career—but the truth 
is there is not an American, living or 
dead, who has put more debt on the 
balance sheet of this country than 
MITCH
MCCONNELL—$17 
trillion—and 
that is just over the last 20 years. And 
for what—to invest in education? to 
build our roads and bridges? to do 
something about mental health in the 
country or water infrastructure? For 
what? It has been to cut taxes for the 
richest people in the country and to 
borrow it all from China, which is the 
opposite of what he said he was doing, 
the opposite of what he promised. 
He said the tax cuts would pay for 
themselves. They never have. He said 
they would benefit the middle class, 
but two-thirds have gone to the top 20 
percent at a time when we have had 
the worst income inequality that we 
have had since 1928, when we have had 
an economy that, for 50 years, 90 per-
cent of the American people haven’t 
seen a pay raise. That means, in the 
first 25 years of this century, we are on 
track to spend $6.8 trillion on tax cuts 
for the richest 20 percent of Americans. 
It is exactly the same thing as if a 
mayor in any one of our communities 
in our States had said to their neigh-
bors and to their city councils and to 
the press: I am going to borrow more 
money than we have ever borrowed be-
fore. 
You would say: Well, that worries me 
a little bit. What are you going to 
spend the money on? Are you going to 
spend it on our roads? 
No. 
Are you going to spend it on our 
bridges? 
No. 
On our water system? 
No. 
On mental health? On COVID? On our 
public health infrastructure? 
I am going to take that money that 
I am borrowing from the Chinese, and I 
am going to give it to the two richest 
neighborhoods in town. 
That is the majority leader’s tax pol-
icy, and that is what it has been since 
2001. 
This speech isn’t about spending, but 
while I have the microphone, here is 
what we could have done for $6.8 tril-
lion: We could have created universal 
preschool for every child in America. 
These are not either/or by the way. 
That is how big a number $6.8 trillion 
is. We could have invested in the 70 
percent of Americans who don’t grad-
uate from college so that they can earn 
a living wage when they graduate from 
high school, not the minimum wage. 
We could have made public college af-
fordable for every middle-class Amer-
ican, given every teacher in America a 
50-percent pay raise and paid them like 
the professionals that they are. 
We could have cut child poverty by 40 
percent in this country. We could have 
protected Social Security so that we 
would know it would be there for our 
children and our grandchildren. We 
could have rebuilt America’s roads, 
bridges, tunnels, and airports. We could 
have laid high-speed broadband in 
every community, lowered the cost of 
prescription drugs, covered everyone 
with high-quality healthcare by cre-
ating a public option. We could have 
passed paid family and medical leave, 
invested in science and public health so 
that we could have been more prepared 
for the global pandemic. We might 
have even paid down some of our debt 
and actually acted fiscally responsible. 
In 
other 
words, 
we 
could 
have 
changed the destiny of America. We 
could have added to Justice Ginsburg’s 
legacy by making this country more 
democratic, more fair, and more free. 
We still can, but we can’t do it as long 
as the majority leader is continuing to 
pursue these policies. 
We have to choose leaders in the Sen-
ate who will build this country better 
than we found it, not leave it in tatters 
for our children and grandchildren to 
pick through the rubble. 
Instead of making the Senate work 
on behalf of the American people, the 
Senator from Kentucky has run rough-
shod over this institution, doing what-
ever he can get away with politically. 
We are at a point at which what you 
can get away with here is the only rule 
that is left. 
As I said last night in this Senate, 
words have lost their meaning, and 
when words lose their meaning and 
when promises mean nothing and when 
commitments mean nothing, that is 
when institutions fail. It is moments 
like this that I remind my colleagues 
that this is not the first Republic to 
risk failure because of all of this—the 
Senate, the Supreme Court, the cen-
turies of rules, written and unwritten, 
that have guided this Republic. 
We are not preserving them for us. 
We are preserving them for the Amer-
ican people because, without our insti-
tutions, we can’t do what we need to do 
in this democracy, whether it is re-
garding climate change or healthcare 
or education or any issue that the 
American people care about, no matter 
what side of the political aisle they are 
on. 
Justice Ginsburg appreciated this. 
She described her philosophy this way: 
I think I am an originalist in the sense of 
what these great men meant—a Constitution 
that would govern through the ages. At 
least, they hoped it would provide an instru-
ment of government that would endure. 
That is what is at stake in this elec-
tion—whether we will accept this sorry 
chapter in our history as the new nor-
mal or insist on a government that can 
actually govern and is focused on the 
needs and desires of the American peo-
ple. 
I hope deeply that we are going to 
put this era behind us, and I am not for 
going back to some old era but to build 
a democracy that is worthy of the 21st 
century, worthy of the example Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg set, worthy of the ex-
pectations that our kids and grandkids 
reasonably have of us and that most of 
us have for America in this world. 
That is the choice in this election, 
and to borrow a phrase from the major-
ity 
leader, 
the 
‘‘American 
people 
should have a voice’’ in the outcome. It 
is my hope that in 41 days they will. 
Madam President, I thank you for 
your patience and thank the staff for 
their patience. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH 
H. SOCCIO 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 23, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. Joseph Soccio, who 
passed away on September 19, 2020 at the 
age of 97. A U.S. Army Air Force and Air 
Force veteran, loving husband, father, and 
grandfather, Mr. Soccio will be dearly missed. 
In 1941 Mr. Soccio graduated from West 
Senior High School, as part of the first grad-
uating class. Shortly after, he entered the U.S. 
Army Air Force, proudly serving his country 
during World War II. During the War, he 
served as Crew Chief on a B–24 Liberator 
Bomber, and attained the rank of Sergeant. 
After World War II, he went on to re-enlist in 
the U.S. Air Force, serving his nation again in 
the Korean War. 
Following his military service, Mr. Soccio re-
turned to Central New York to work for Alco 
Products. He spent 30 years with the com-
pany, and led its Mechanical Laboratories Di-
vision. 
Outside of his work, Mr. Soccio was a man 
of faith, and a longtime member of St. 
Alphonsus Church in Auburn. He enjoyed gar-
dening, coaching youth baseball, and was an 
avid hunter. Most of all, he loved his family 
deeply. He is survived by his three children, 
four grandchildren, and two great-grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in honoring the life of Mr. Jo-
seph Soccio. A cherished member of our Cen-
tral New York community, Mr. Soccio will be 
deeply missed. I ask my colleagues to keep 
him and his family in mind as we celebrate his 
life.

IN HONOR OF THE MEMORY OF 
JOSEPH PETERSON 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 23, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the esteemed 
life of a dear friend, Joe Peterson. He will for-
ever be remembered for his tremendous im-
pact on our Wyandotte community, and he will 
be deeply missed. 
Mayor Peterson was a pillar of Wyandotte. 
Before beginning his career in public service, 
Peterson was a long-time police officer in the 
Wyandotte Police Department. Throughout his 
twenty-seven years with the police force, 
Peterson held several different positions in-
cluding undercover officer, detective sergeant, 
and probation officer. In 2005, Peterson was 
elected to serve on the Wyandotte City Coun-
cil and was elected mayor in 2009. Through-
out all capacities, Peterson endeavored to 
make Wyandotte a better place for all. 
Mayor Peterson was a dedicated, compas-
sionate, and effective leader who humbly 
strove for excellence without seeking praise or 
recognition for any of his significant accom-
plishments. As a veteran who served in the 
U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, Peterson 
knew deeply what it meant to be a committed 
and loyal fighter. He never stopped caring for 
others, especially his fellow veterans, and 
faithfully served his beloved Wyandotte. 
Mayor Peterson leaves behind a legacy that 
will forever endure. He was a true representa-
tion of a passionate public servant who was 
unwavering in his commitment to make Wyan-
dotte a better place. He strove to foster a 
deep sense of community, and was a 
steadying voice of reason in troubling or chal-
lenging times. He encouraged us to see the 
best in one another and work together for the 
common good. Undoubtably, Peterson has left 
a meaningful impact on the city, and the love 
he had for Wyandotte will always be remem-
bered. His passing represents a loss to our 
entire community, but his memory will endure 
through the countless lives he touched. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and legacy of Joe 
Peterson. He was a cornerstone of Wyan-
dotte, and we will forever remember his re-
markable life, work, and community impact. 
May he rest in eternal peace.

REMEMBRANCE OF MR. VINCENT 
GIEDRAITIS 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 23, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to share a remembrance of Mr. Vincent 
Giedraitis, a member of the ‘‘Greatest Genera-
tion’’ from Vernon, Connecticut who passed 
away at the age of 95 on August 10, 2020. 
Vin, as he was known to friends and col-
leagues led an extraordinary life, setting an 
example of how to really succeed by bal-
ancing family, professional success as an at-
torney, and service to his country at sea in the 
U.S. Navy. 
Vin balanced a long life full of many inter-
ests and hobbies with his work, with his val-
ued friendships and his vibrant family life. He 
was an avid skier and fisherman. He enjoyed 
tennis, ballroom dancing, boating, golf and 
making a yearly batch of wild grape jelly. He 
played, studied and worked with determination 
and great satisfaction. He graduated from New 
Britain High School and then served in the 
Navy as a radar engineer on the U.S. John 
Bole destroyer in WWII. In the time after the 
war, he attended Central Connecticut State 
College and graduated from McGill University 
with a degree in Philosophy. While at McGill 
he met the love of his life, Joyce, and they 
were married for over 70 years. After settling 
in Connecticut and while raising their family, 
he went on to earn his Law Degree at the 
UConn School of Law. He went on to work for 
IBM, Aetna Insurance, Fuller Brush and then 
established his own private law practice in 
Hartford. He became a Public Defender for the 
City of Hartford and then for the town of 
Vernon-Rockville. 
Madam Speaker, I had a chance to see 
Vin’s work in the Public Defender’s Office up 
close over the years. As a law school intern 
who worked in the Hartford Superior Court, I 
helped interview clients and witnesses and as-
sisted him during court hearings and trials. 
After passing the bar I continued to work with 
Vin as a public defender myself and in private 
practice. As most people know, public defend-
ers have to grapple with high caseloads, 
sometimes difficult clients and limited re-
sources to fully investigate cases. Sometimes 
public defenders succumb to viewing their role 
as moving cases along, and not pursuing the 
fullest defense possible. Not Vin. He took his 
oath and the constitutional duty under the 
Sixth Amendment to provide effective assist-
ance of counsel to the fullest degree possible. 
I saw him press judges and prosecutors hard-
er than they were normally accustomed in his 
pursuit of fairness and equal justice. It gave 
me a true insight into his strong character, 
which I admired deeply. As friendly and affa-
ble a person as he was, he had a spine of 
steel that was always centered on ethics and 
compassion. 
Madam Speaker, Vin was devoted to his 
amazing, impressive wife Joyce, their eight 
children and many grandchildren who all loved 
him dearly and mourn his passing. Madam 
Speaker, I would ask the members to join me 
in honoring the wonderful life and legacy of 
Vincent Giedraitis.

Park for more than fifty years, Ms. Lewis 
strived to make Highland Park a world-class 
city. First elected to the City Council in 2003, 
Norma Lewis served five consecutive terms. 
She was the longest-seated woman to serve 
in the history of Highland Park. Her service in-
cluded terms as City Council President Pro- 
Tem in 2007 and City Council President in 
2009. 
Norma Lewis’ public service to Highland 
Park is marked by her dedication to improving 
access to services for senior citizens and ac-
cess to clean water for all. She actively 
worked to improve city infrastructure for im-
proved water service. In addition, Ms. Lewis 
led several projects to provide holiday meals

Ms. Lewis spearheaded the revitalization of 
the city’s Mark E. Storen Memorial Park, al-
lowing for greater enjoyment of the public

IN REMEMBRANCE OF JACK 
EVERSOLE 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 23, 2020 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in remembrance of T. Jack Eversole, founder 
of the Barren River Area Development District 
(BRADD) in my district. Jack passed away 
peacefully last month, and he will be sorely 
missed. 
A World War II Marine Corps veteran who 
served in the South Pacific, Jack graduated 
from the University of Kentucky and Western 
Kentucky University and was passionate about 
serving 
his 
community. 
Before 
founding 
BRADD, Jack worked in journalism and com-
munications in Glasgow and Bowling Green, 
was on the Bowling Green-Warren County 
Planning Commission, and served as a War-
ren 
County 
Magistrate. 
He 
established 
BRADD in 1968 and led the organization for 
32 years, growing it from a three-person team 
with a $50,000 budget to a thriving agency 
with a budget of $7.6 million when he retired 
in 2000. 
Jack was innovative, and he always wanted 
to help solve problems. He directed many 
projects that have been instrumental to the 
Commonwealth and to the region. His hard 
work continues to benefit Kentuckians, and I 
am grateful for all that he did during his time 
with BRADD and serving our country. I join 
the entire south-central Kentucky community 
in mourning the loss of Jack Eversole who 
was a faithful servant to our state and country. 
My prayers are with his family and friends as 
he is laid to rest in Arlington National Ceme-
tery. 
HONORING LITERACYCNY 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 23, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, in celebration 
of National Adult Education and Family Lit-
eracy 
Week, 
I 
rise 
today 
to 
honor 
LiteracyCNY. 
In 
Central 
New 
York, 
LiteracyCNY is making a tremendous impact 
on our community by working to boost literacy 
rates for adult students who read, write, or 
speak English below the 6th grade level. 
Founded by Ruth Colvin in 1962, for more 
than 70 years LiteracyCNY has helped thou-
sands of adults in Onondaga County improve 
their literacy and English skills by offering free 
reading 
and 
writing 
instruction. 
However 
today, there’s still more work to be done. Ac-
cording to the Programme for the International 
Assessment of Adult Competencies, there are 
approximately 60,000 adults in Onondaga 
County with limited literacy skills and English 
proficiency. Without these skills, individuals in 
our community are unable to fully participate 
as citizens, parents, or employees. 
In recent years, LiteracyCNY has continued 
to make progress, enrolling more than 350 
students on an annual basis, with approxi-
mately 80 percent of their students making 
measurable gains on standardized tests. Even 
amid the COVID–19 pandemic, LiteracyCNY 
has continued their important work. The orga-
nization adapted to changing circumstances 
and provided learners with instruction via tele-
conferencing. 
In addition to its work on reading and writ-
ing, LiteracyCNY provides students with les-
sons to help them thrive in their daily lives. 
The organization offers information and refer-
rals to human and emergency services, and 
makes individuals aware of local job opportu-
nities. LiteracyCNY also works to raise aware-
ness about the issue of adult literacy and vol-
unteers advocate to policymakers on behalf of 
their students in Central New York. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate National 
Adult Education and Family Literacy Week, I 
ask that my colleagues in the House join me 
in honoring the contributions of LiteracyCNY. 
Through its work to boost literacy rates, this 
organization is helping adults in Central New 
York achieve career success, teach their chil-
dren, and reach their full potential.

he was appointed to Sergeant at Arms. In this 
role, Tim has been responsible for managing 
twenty-five full time employees and overseeing 
the security and maintenance of the Florida 
Senate buildings, including the Senate Cham-
ber. For close to six years, Tim has done a 
commendable job ensuring the safety of all 
who work in or visit the Florida Senate and I 
am thankful for his dedicated service. 
Having had the privilege of knowing Tim for 
many years, I can firsthand attest to his pro-
fessionalism and dedication to serving the 
State of Florida. His respectful demeanor is 
apparent to all who have worked with him and 
I know that he has represented the Florida 
Senate well. While I recognize that Tim’s col-
leagues will greatly miss his leadership and 
expertise, I have no doubt that he will excel in 
his future position at the Florida Department of 
Education.

ute to Mr. Tim Hay, and I ask my fellow col-

troduced by Representatives BRETT GUTHRIE 
and ELIOT ENGEL. 
Today, the FDA has the authority to destroy 
confiscated counterfeit or adulterated drugs. 
This bill extends that authority to medical de-
vices. 
Illicit trade and counterfeit products present 
growing risks to patients and consumers. We 
have the opportunity to ensure that FDA has 
the authority needed to destroy counterfeit 
drugs, devices and combination products. 
This bill closes a gap and protects patients 
from the growing threat of counterfeit prod-
ucts, and I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

IN CELEBRATION OF EDYTHE 
MCTAGGART’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 23, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Edythe McTaggart as she celebrates her 
100th birthday. This significant milestone is 
worthy of commendation. 
Edythe McTaggart was born August 21, 
1920 to Edmond Parent and Edith Tice, and 
grew up in Trenton, Michigan. Throughout her 
childhood, Edythe enjoyed performing with her 
sister Dottie, and even sang on a children’s 
radio show in Detroit at the age of nine. Dur-
ing the Great Depression, Edythe stayed 
home to care for her father who lost his job. 
To get through the troubling era, she would 
collect discarded skim milk from a local 
creamery and help her father knock coal off 
freight trains to heat their house. At the age of 
17, Edythe became a nanny where she 
earned one dollar a day plus room and board. 
Despite the meager wages, the impact of the 
Great Depression taught Edythe how to be 
frugal in her spending and allowed her to save 
enough earnings to buy a wedding dress 
when she got married. 
In 1940, Edythe married her husband, Rob-
ert McTaggart. The two built a home together 
in Wyandotte and completed much of the work 
themselves. Although it was difficult finding 
materials during the war, they were able to 
move into the new home in 1948. Throughout 
the war, the two also started a family and wel-
comed sons Robert Jr., Thomas, and David by 
1952. After raising her children, Edythe re-
turned to school and earned her bachelor’s 
degree in education at the age of 50. She be-
came a teacher in the Taylor School District, 
and later earned a master’s degree in special 
education. Until her retirement 35 years ago, 
she dedicated her teaching career to helping 
children with special needs and disabilities. 
Beyond the classroom, Edythe is fond of 
traveling and has explored the world with Rob-
ert. Together, they visited Europe, Asia, Latin 
America, and the Caribbean. Upon her retire-
ment, Edythe and Robert began spending win-
ters in Florida, until Robert’s passing in 1998. 
Today, Edythe remains active in the commu-
nity and enjoys reading, crocheting, and 
spending time with her sons, three grand-
children, and one great-grandchild. Her atti-
tude and spirit continue to shine bright for all 
to see. Throughout her 100 years, Edythe has 
demonstrated a true commitment to her family 
and her community. Her strength and perse-
verance through turbulent times has provided 
a lasting example of what can be accom-
plished when we all work together and treat 
one another with compassion, respect, and 
dignity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating Edythe McTaggart on her 
100th birthday. I join with Edythe’s friends and 
family in extending my best and warmest 
wishes to her on this special day. May her 
100th year bring her many blessings and a 
continued life full of laughter, peace, and 
every happiness.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E876 
September 23, 2020 
For nearly seven years, John has led the 
Port of Virginia as the Chief Executive Officer 
and Executive Director. John assembled and 
cultivated a skilled and highly knowledgeable 
team, then provided impressive leadership and 
vision, to transform the Port of Virginia into a 
twenty-first century facility. 
With a mantra of ‘‘Wider, Deeper & Safer,’’ 
John steered the approval, funding and com-
mencement of dredging the Norfolk Harbor 
and Channels to fifty-five feet depth. This will 
allow Hampton Roads to accommodate fully 
loaded Ultra-Large Container Vessels now and 
in the future. As Hampton Roads is also home 
to the world’s largest naval base with six air-
craft carriers, this widening will also enable 
safe, two-way traffic to prevent delays to com-
mercial and military vessels. 
Under John’s supervision, the Port of Vir-
ginia constructed the new Virginia International 
Gateway. Hosting the largest ship-to-shore 
cranes in the Western Hemisphere, this state- 
of-the-art facility has some of the best cargo 
flow rates and vehicle turn-times in the nation. 
While expanding the Port’s capacity, John 
also 
successfully 
reduced 
emissions 
by 
transitioning away from diesel-driven container 
movement to an electric, safer and more 
space-conscious method of container handling 
and stacking. These electric gantry cranes 
dramatically reduce emissions, fuel consump-
tion and noise. 
With a vision for the future, John has 
planned and begun building the first infrastruc-
ture dedicated to our region’s nascent offshore 
wind industry. Recognizing the Port of Vir-
ginia’s natural benefits with a deep channel 
and no overhead obstructions, he has helped 
posture Hampton Roads to become a nucleus 
for our nation’s growing carbon-free power 
generation industry. 
The improvements John has made at the 
Port have benefited not only all Virginians but 
most Americans. The Port of Virginia’s reach 
covers all commerce east of the Mississippi 
River and even extends to Kansas City, MO. 
Through the partnerships John helped build, 
the Port of Virginia achieved record-setting 
cargo volume for six consecutive years. The 
COVID–19 pandemic has proven American 
businesses and workers need efficient and re-
liable supply chains, and the Port has proven 
vital to this endeavor. 
John’s dedication to strengthening and im-
proving Virginia’s infrastructure and economy 
is truly inspiring. I am proud to honor and rec-
ognize his leadership and the role he plays in 
making our community a better place. Hamp-
ton Roads has significantly benefited from his 
efforts.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
GRANT JAQUITH 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 23, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of my good friend and former 
colleague, Grant Jaquith, who upon his ap-
pointment as a Judge on the United States 
Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, has re-
signed from the Department of Justice after 
serving 31 years. I was proud to serve along-
side Mr. Jaquith while working for the U.S. At-
torney’s Office for the Northern District of New 
York and have always known him to be a 
dedicated public servant, staunch defender of 
the law, a stalwart advocate for victims and 
their families, and a genuinely good person. 
After graduating with a Juris Doctor from 
University of Florida College of Law in 1982, 
Mr. Jaquith began his career as a Judge Ad-
vocate on active duty in the U.S. Army. He 
then went on to join the Department of Jus-
tice, where he served as a line prosecutor, su-
pervisor, and eventually, as the 49th U.S. At-
torney for the Northern District of New York. 
Over the course of his career, Mr. Jaquith 
prosecuted 
many 
high-profile 
cases 
that 
strengthened national security and helped 
combat violent crime, organized crime, the 
opioid crisis, and financial fraud. I had the 
privilege of working with Mr. Jaquith on a 
number of these cases and saw first-hand 
how his dogged determination and keen intel-
lect spelled trouble for criminals. The impact 
he had on my career was profound and his 
guidance made me a better prosecutor and 
person. For his work, Mr. Jaquith earned a 
number of awards, including the Executive Of-
fice for U.S. Attorneys Director’s Award for Ex-
ecutive Achievement. 
As a supervisor, Mr. Jaquith developed 
scores of young prosecutors, always stressing 
thoroughness, hard work, determination and 
above all ethical conduct. Through his efforts, 
the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern Dis-
trict of New York became known as one of the 
premier offices in the country. As U.S. Attor-
ney, Mr. Jaquith continued to take a leader-
ship role in the many successes of the office. 
He also took a national leadership role by 
serving on several subcommittees of the Attor-
ney General’s Advisory Committee, including 
Border and Immigration, Native American 
Issues, and Servicemembers and Veterans 
Rights. He also served on the Attorney Gen-
eral’s Advisory Committee’s Healthcare Fraud 
Working Group. Outside of work, Mr. Jaquith 
is a dedicated husband to his wife Rosemarie. 
Together, they have six children, and five 
grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in recognizing the highly 
distinguished career of Grant Jaquith. A dedi-
cated public servant, I wish Grant the best as 
he enters the next phase of his career as a 
Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for Vet-
erans Claims.

PROTECTING PATIENTS 
TRANSPORTATION TO CARE ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 21, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 3935, the Protecting Patients 
Transportation to Care Act. I’m proud to have 
advanced this bipartisan bill out of my Health 
Subcommittee and I’m pleased to support it on 
the Floor. 
The Protecting Patients Transportation to 
Care 
Act 
introduced 
by 
Representatives 
BUDDY CARTER and TONY CA´RDENAS requires 
states to offer a non-emergency medical trans-
portation benefit. Our Committee also heard 
from Representative SANFORD BISHOP about 
this legislation during our Members’ Day 
panel. 
Medicaid’s coverage of transportation to 
health services is a lifeline for patients, espe-
cially those who live in rural or underserved 
areas. 
Over half of Medicaid transportation serv-
ices are used by patients with the highest bur-
den of chronic diseases, including those diag-
nosed with cancer, HIV, mental illness, sub-
stance abuse, and end-stage renal disease. 
Without this help, patients cannot access 
the chemotherapy, dialysis, and other services 
that allow them to remain at home and out of 
the hospital. 
Medicaid transportation has been a manda-
tory Medicaid benefit by regulation since the 
Medicaid program’s inception in 1966. This bill 
codifies and protects the benefit. 
I urge my colleagues to support this com-
monsense bill.

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, due to pre-scheduled travel with the 
President, I was absent from voting on Sep-
tember 22, 2020. As such, I was unable to 
vote on the Continuing Resolution, which will 
keep the government funded into December 
and provide critical funding for the USDA’s 
Commodity Credit Corporation. 
To ensure USDA meets its farm bill obliga-
tions and temporary assistance to rural Amer-
ica continues during these difficult times, re-
plenishing the CCC was a major priority and 
I strongly support its inclusion in this CR.

NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION 
DAY 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 23, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, yesterday, 
our Nation marked National Voter Registration 
Day. But it was also a day of reckoning and 
milestone as our Nation surpassed 200,000 
COVID–19 deaths. Unfortunately, by erecting 
barriers to voting, we are sending the wrong 
signal to our citizens. We can do better as vot-
ing is the lifeblood of our Democracy. 
Our nation must take common sense steps 
like passing the HEROES Act with its $3.6 bil-
lion for state election grants and reigning in 
the President’s politization of the USPS.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E877 
September 23, 2020 
The State of Ohio can also do better. Ohio 
must add more drop boxes for voting, provide 
universal prepaid postage, and simplify the 
ballot request process. 
While Republican leaders in Columbus and 
in Washington have wrapped themselves in 
knots, yesterday, I led an Ohio delegation let-
ter urging Ohio higher educational institutions 
proactively educate students, faculty, and staff 
about how to ensure their voice is heard at the 
ballot box. 
I include in the RECORD our September 22, 
2020, letter. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, September 22, 2020. 
DEAR OHIO COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PRESI-
DENTS: As our State continues to grapple 
with the challenges presented by COVID–19, 
our nation is relying on Ohio’s colleges and 
universities to take a leadership role in en-
suring access to the ballot box. This duty is 
particularly important as we commemorate 
national voter registration day on Sep-
tember 22, 2020. Your institutions play a key 
role in ensuring that students understand 
how to access and exercise their constitu-
tionally enshrined right to vote. Under nor-
mal circumstances, students face barriers to 
voting, and in these difficult times, those 
barriers have multiplied. We ask that each of 
you to take steps to ensure your institution 
commits to easing barriers for your faculty, 
students and staff to vote. 
As we know, the 1965 Higher Education Act 
(HEA) helped increase access to higher edu-
cation for low-income and first-generation 
college students. In 1998, recognizing the im-
portance of involving younger generations in 
the democratic process, Congress expanded 
the scope of the act to include provisions on 
student voting. Section 487(a)(23) of the HEA 
as reauthorized in 1998 specified that institu-
tions must make a good faith effort to facili-
tate student voter registration. This rein-
forced vital role institutions of higher edu-
cation play in educating and encouraging 
students to vote. 
Your institutions have the opportunity to 
play an essential role in ensuring that young 
Americans participate in our democracy by 
taking simple steps such as designating 
places where students can complete voter 
registration forms or absentee ballot re-
quests. Colleges can text students where 
these one-stop election stations are located 
and can e-mail students a voter registration 
link. 
Institutions should share broad voter edu-
cation information about how to vote, in-
cluding the following: 
∑ Communicate to your students to ensure 
they are registered to vote and that their 
registration information is up to date. 
∑ Explain Ohio’s voter ID requirements di-
rectly to students and staff with emails, 
posters or mailers. Students driver’s license 
may be expired this year, but the Ohio legis-
lature authorized individuals to vote with an 
expired license, which students, faculty and 
staff may not know. 
∑ Clarify that if a student’s current ad-
dress varies from where they registered when 
they go to vote, they can vote absentee, with 
the mailer sent to another address, or they 
can vote provisionally if they can prove their 
address. 
∑ Be prepared to educate students on how 
to vote by mail or vote provisionally in the 
event that campuses close due to the pan-
demic. 
∑ Make clear to students that where you 
register to vote will not affect federal finan-
cial aid such as Pell Grants, Perkins or Staf-
ford loans, or your dependency status for 
FAFSA; being registered to vote at a dif-
ferent address from your parents does not 
prevent them from claiming you as a depend-
ent on their taxes; and being deemed out-of- 
state for tuition purposes does not prevent 
you from choosing to register to vote in your 
campus community. 
∑ Provide faculty, staff, and students with 
information about how to volunteer as poll 
workers. 
Students, faculty and staff at your institu-
tions need the type of nonpartisan voter in-
formation described in this letter. In a time 
where voter disinformation is rampant, your 
colleges and universities have not only a 
legal obligation, but also a moral obligation 
to make your campuses an example of demo-
cratic participation. Thank you for your 
leadership and for taking every step possible 
to ease the barriers of voting for eligible vot-
ers on your campuses.

MARCY KAPTUR, 
Member of Congress.
