PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord of us all, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
As leaders continue to pursue agree-
ment 
on 
omnibus 
and 
further 
coronavirus relief legislation, we ask 
Your generous gifting of wisdom for all 
those so engaged. The day-to-day well 
being of so many Americans depends 
upon the success of their work. 
As vaccines begin to be distributed 
throughout the country, we thank You 
again for the wonderful work of med-
ical scientists, and the ongoing heroic 
work of those who care for the sick, 
and who will be among the first inocu-
lated. May the vaccines prove to be ef-
ficacious, and thus bring hope to our 
world. 
Today, as well, the electoral college 
will do its work verifying the results of 
our national election in November. 
May the genius of our Founders be re-
vealed as the world witnesses the glory 
of self-government in our electoral sys-
tem. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

S7453 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 2020 
No. 211 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, continue to help us, for 
the kingdom, the power, and the glory 
belong to You. 
Permit our lawmakers to feel Your 
power and trust Your sovereignty. May 
this trust impel them to dare boldly, to 
venture on wider seas where storms 
will show Your mastery. 
Remind them that You will honor 
Your promise to never leave or forsake 
them. Help them also to remember 
that evil can triumph when good people 
refuse to act. 
Lord, inspire our Senators to strive 
always to please You. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
for 1 minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to thank the Library 
of Congress and to talk about some-
thing that honors our veterans. 
Iowa has a rich history of veterans 
serving on behalf of our country. Their 
service ensures that all Americans will 
live in peace and prosperity for genera-
tions to come. Over the past 2 years, I 
have delivered 31 personal accounts to 
be stored at the Library of Congress as 
part of their program called the Vet-
erans History Project. I thank the Li-
brary of Congress for preserving the in-
dividual stories as reported in the vet-
eran’s own words. 
Today, I will submit six more inter-
views to this collection that we re-
corded at the Waverly Area Veterans 
Post last month. I am proud to be a 
part of the Veterans History Project, 
preserving the stories of Iowa veterans 
for future generations. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
past weekend, we saw that the historic 
nationwide effort to bring this pan-
demic to heel has begun a critical final 
chapter. After months of development, 
the first U.S. doses of COVID–19 vac-
cine rolled off the assembly line, bound 
for treatment facilities all across our 
country. 
I am particularly proud that an im-
portant waypoint on that journey is 
my hometown of Louisville, KY. Yes-
terday alone, Pfizer shipped 2.5 million 
vaccine doses, and less than an hour 
after their airlift began, shipments 
bound for the eastern United States 
were 
passing 
through 
the 
UPS 
Worldport logistics hub at Muhammad 
Ali International Airport in Louisville. 
In the days and weeks ahead, the hard 
work of Kentuckians at UPS’s new 
healthcare command center in Louis-
ville will play a critical role in fin-
ishing this fight. 
Already they have helped direct tens 
of thousands of doses to Kentucky hos-
pitals, where they are being adminis-
tered 
to 
the 
Commonwealth’s 
healthcare workers and most at-risk 
residents. 
There is a historic success story 
being written today along the vaccine 
supply chain, from Missouri to Massa-
chusetts, to Michigan, to Kentucky, to 
frontlines all across our country, and it 
is emblematic of an approach that has 
been helping our country since the ear-
liest days of the crisis. From the per-
sonal precautions that helped save our 
health system to the bravery of the 
doctors, nurses, and other healthcare 
workers who spent sleepless nights 
tending to victims of the virus, to the 
ingenuity of entrepreneurs who have 
spun out masks and sanitizer or kept 
serving their customers safely, to the 
patience of parents and school kids 
who have had to adapt in extraordinary 
ways, to our economic efforts to blunt 
the pain of a self-inflicted slowdown 
without precedent, all along the way, 
it has been a heroic, resilient American 
people fighting and winning this battle, 
with the government providing smart, 
targeted, and essential support to sus-
tain them. 
It is the American people who have 
brought the light at the end of the tun-
nel within sight, but Washington has 
played a key role in creating the condi-
tions for them to do it. That joint ef-
fort is how the unanimous, bipartisan 
CARES Act programs helped to sustain 
struggling families, prevented millions 
more layoffs, and gave Main Street a 
fighting chance. It is how Operation 
Warp Speed has helped to unleash pri-
vate enterprise and the genius of re-
searchers on a breakneck campaign for 
a cure that, just a few months ago, the 
mainstream media was lecturing Presi-
dent Trump would be impossible. 
At every step, the story of this year 
has been American workers and fami-
lies digging deep, muscling through, 
and lending one another a helping 
hand, with an assist from those of us 
here in Congress. But there is a prob-
lem. The American people’s work is not

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7454 
December 14, 2020 
finished. The struggle continues every 
day. Cases and deaths are mounting. 
The commerce that sustains small 
businesses is still depressed. Working 
families are still trying to grind 
through, but recently Washington has 
not held up its end of the bargain. 
For months—literally months—both 
sides in Congress have known roughly 
what the shape of a compromise rescue 
package could look like. We know all 
the areas where we do not even dis-
agree and should be able to make sig-
nificant law. But, alas, partisan dy-
namics and political posturing have 
prevented us from getting more relief 
out the door, even in areas where no-
body even claims to disagree. 
I don’t want to relitigate the last 
weeks and months this afternoon. Any-
one who wants to dole out blame has a 
clear record they can analyze. 
It is time for this body to collec-
tively recognize that finger-pointing 
doesn’t put food on the table for strug-
gling families. Finger-pointing doesn’t 
help people avoid having to choose be-
tween Christmas gifts and making 
rent. And finger-pointing does not do a 
darn thing to fund vaccine distribution 
so we can slam the door on this virus 
as fast as possible and maximize the 
number of lives we can save. 
That last point is a concern that 
State health officials across the coun-
try have raised repeatedly. Even with 
vaccines on the way, many are report-
ing that they don’t have the funds to 
hire enough trained workers or pur-
chase enough PPE to safely administer 
them as fast as possible. As one health 
observer put it, ‘‘It would be a shame if 
all the effort on Warp Speed for devel-
opment isn’t warp speed for distribu-
tion.’’ That is what we risk if Congress 
can’t get our act together and supply 
the funds to deliver this literal shot in 
the arm to our people. This is the sup-
port that State and local governments 
need most urgently—not unfettered 
slush 
funds 
for 
non-COVID-related 
needs that predate the pandemic but 
incredibly urgent, targeted money to 
get citizens vaccinated right now and 
finish the fight. 
That isn’t the only urgent priority 
that Congress must not leave behind. 
The same business owners and working 
families who relied on the Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
to 
get 
them 
through the bleakest points of the 
spring and summer are, once again, 
facing tough choices. Renewed health 
restrictions 
and 
decreased 
demand 
mean that some American jobs that 
have been sustained all this period may 
not survive the last home stretch. 
So we can help. We can provide a sec-
ond round of job-saving PPP tailored 
to those who need it most. 
And what about Americans who have 
already lost their jobs in the pandemic 
through no fault of their own? Several 
key unemployment programs are set to 
expire at the end of the month. This is 
not an outcome that struggling people 
deserve, least of all during the holiday. 
So we should act. We should act. 
The next several days are going to 
bring about one of two outcomes. Ei-
ther 100 Senators will be here shaking 
our heads, slinging blame, and offering 
excuses about why we still have not 
been able to make a law, or we will 
break for the holidays having sent an-
other huge dose of relief out the door 
for the people who need it. 
So, look, it is up to us. It is up to us. 
We decide. This is entirely within our 
control. I can speak for the Republican 
side: We want to make a law to agree 
where we can and help people who need 
it. I hope and believe that my Demo-
cratic colleagues will feel the same 
way. It is about time to get this done.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate returns with precious 
little time left to finish important 
matters of business. Last week, both 
Houses of Congress passed the annual 
Defense bill with veto-proof majorities. 
If President Trump takes the rather ri-
diculous step of vetoing a pay raise for 
our troops in order to defend the honor 
of dead Confederate traitors—or what-
ever other contrived grounds he comes 
up with—Congress must override that 
veto. 
On Friday, both Chambers of Con-
gress also passed a 1-week continuing 
resolution, giving us until the end of 
this week to finish an omnibus appro-
priations bill to fund the government. 
As usual, the appropriations bill will 
include several important pieces of re-
lated legislation. One that doesn’t get 
enough attention is a bipartisan energy 
bill. 
Earlier this year, during the debate 
over the Energy bill, Senate Democrats 
insisted that a provision to reduce 
HFCs—a very harmful greenhouse gas 
that is driving our climate change 
problem—must be included in the bill. 
Unfortunately, we had to hold up the 
bill until a bipartisan agreement could 
be reached on this critical provision, 
which would be the single biggest vic-
tory in the fight against climate 
change to pass this body in a decade. 
Today, I am very happy to report 
that we have made very good progress 
toward an agreement on HFC reduc-
tion. We are about to get it done. That 
is one of the biggest victories to fight 
global warming in a very long time. 
I want to thank Senators CARPER, 
KENNEDY, and BARRASSO. They have 
worked very diligently and very hard 
to craft a compromise. 
Finally, as we all know, it is impera-
tive we pass another round of emer-
gency Federal relief from the contin-
ued impact of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Today, the bipartisan group of Sen-
ators who have been diligently working 
toward an agreement will announce the 
results of their work: a package of over 
$900 billion that includes an agreement 
on assistance to State and local gov-
ernment. Notably, there is no agree-
ment on corporate immunity. We look 
forward 
to 
reviewing 
their 
work. 
Democrats remain 100 percent com-
mitted to getting another round of 
emergency relief to the American peo-
ple before the end of the year and in a 
robust, bold way because America 
needs it so badly. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, a 
year that was full of bad news for the 
country is coming to an end with some 
very good news. Over the past 8 to 9 
months, 
American 
scientists, 
bio-
chemists, and researchers rushed to 
produce a safe and effective vaccine to 
the COVID–19 pandemic—and they have 
succeeded in extraordinary fashion. 
We don’t have just one but several 
candidates for a vaccine, each of which 
has shown to be 90 percent effective in 
clinical trials. One of those vaccines 
has been approved, authorized by the 
FDA for emergency use. And as we 
speak, an assembly line of workers in 
masks, gloves, and face shields are 
pulling doses out of the freezer, loading 
them into cold storage palettes, and 
onto trucks to be shipped to States 
across the country. 
The discovery of a COVID–19 vaccine 
within the timeframe of a calendar 
year is a crowning scientific achieve-
ment of the 21st century. It should 
bring not only a feeling of relief to the 
country—indeed, to the entire world— 
but also deep admiration and pride for 
America’s scientists and our medical 
workers. 
I remember, in the early days of the 
pandemic, going to the window of our 
Brooklyn apartment each night to ap-
plaud 
our 
frontline 
workers. 
The 
whoops, claps, and metallic clang of 
pots and pans echoed for miles. Our 
medical researchers—as well as thou-
sands of Americans who selflessly vol-
unteered for clinical trials—deserve 
the same national expression of grati-
tude. 
We can show our gratitude here in 
Congress by communicating clearly 
that the COVID–19 vaccine is safe, ef-
fective, 
and 
that 
every 
American 
should inoculate themselves when it 
becomes available. Skepticism about 
vaccines was already too high before 
the pandemic. Several polls have shown 
it to be an alarming concern with re-
spect to the COVID–19 vaccine. It is an 
absolute disgrace that the Republican 
majority on the Homeland Security 
Committee has invited a prominent 
skeptic of the COVID–19 vaccine to de-
liver testimony in a hearing this week. 
Public figures at all levels should be 
building up confidence in a vaccine, 
not giving a platform to those who un-
dermine it. 
At the moment, the vaccine is being 
distributed to medical personnel, doc-
tors, nurses, frontline workers, and the 
most vulnerable populations. I myself 
will take the vaccine as soon as it is 
appropriate and recommended. I will 
not skip the line. But make no mis-
take, we should all lead by example, 
commit to taking the vaccine, and tell 
our constituents to take it as well. 
The CDC and our States will con-
tinue to advise which populations 
should be inoculated based on avail-
ability, and we will follow that guid-
ance. 
f 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
one other note—today, members of the 
electoral college are gathering in all 50 
States and the District of Columbia to 
formally select Joe Biden as the next 
President of the United States of 
America. 
Typically, the meeting of the elec-
toral college is merely a formality. The 
Presidential election took place over a 
month ago. The result is not in doubt. 
In almost any other year, both major 
parties would have fully and publicly 
accepted the will of the American peo-
ple by now—the peaceful passing of the 
torch, a hallmark of our grand democ-
racy. But this year, it seems as if Joe 
Biden has had to be declared the win-
ner of the Presidential election again 
and again and again—and still, our Re-
publican colleagues have not fully 
come to grips with that reality. Just 
how many times does President Trump 
have to lose before rank-and-file Re-
publicans—before most Senators—ac-
knowledge that Joe Biden will be the 
next President of the United States? 
Last week, more than 100 Republican 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives signed their names to a lawsuit 
that would invalidate the results of the 
election in four swing States. For any 
serious person, much less a Member of 
the U.S. Congress, to sign their name 
to such an anti-democratic document 
is beyond shameful.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7456 
December 14, 2020 
To my knowledge, the Republican 
leader of the Senate still has not re-
ferred to Joe Biden as President-elect. 
Will he change his tune now that the 
electoral college has once again con-
firmed his victory? Will the rest of my 
Republican Senate colleagues do the 
same? 
After no evidence of widespread voter 
fraud was found in the country, after 
State election officials corroborated 
the accuracy of the results in every 
State in the country, after the Trump 
campaign’s legal team racked up an as-
tonishing win-loss record of 1 and 59, 
after the Supreme Court summarily 
dismissed two ludicrous efforts by Re-
publicans to invalidate the results in 
swing 
States, 
will 
the 
Republican 
Party in Congress, here in the Senate, 
finally acknowledge the results of an 
election that was determined over a 
month ago? 
Just how long are Republicans going 
to keep up this charade, which has be-
come a national embarrassment? Even 
now, the Chairman of the Homeland 
Security Committee is planning to 
hold a hearing this week about what he 
calls ‘‘election irregularities.’’ 
Look, 
our 
Republican 
colleagues 
don’t have to like the results of the 
election, but they have a solemn re-
sponsibility to accept them. They have 
a duty to confer legitimacy on them. 
Instead, for the past month, they have 
given President Trump the space to 
promote wild conspiracy theories about 
election fraud and poison Americans’ 
faith in our democracy. 
As the electoral college casts the ma-
jority of its votes for Joe Biden—the 
same number of votes that President 
Trump called a landslide 4 years ago— 
our Republican colleagues must do now 
what they should have done a month 
ago: Accept the legitimacy of Joe 
Biden’s election to the Presidency of 
the United States. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we 
all know by now, late Friday evening, 
the world received the news that we 
have been waiting, hoping, and praying 
for since March. The first COVID–19 
vaccine was approved here in the 
United States. The vaccine was devel-
oped by Pfizer and its German partner 
BioNtech and was found to be 95 per-
cent effective in preventing COVID–19 
during clinical trials—extensive clin-
ical trials. 
The leaders of Operation Warp Speed 
immediately mobilized the distribution 
plan, and the first doses of the vaccine 
are arriving at healthcare facilities 
across the country today. Texas’s ini-
tial shipment of nearly 225,000 doses 
will be administered to our healthcare 
workers this week by our healthcare 
workers, and we will provide these he-
roes with the protection they need to 
continue their fight on our behalf on 
the frontlines. 
This is a turning point in our war 
against COVID, and the significance of 
this victory in such an expedited time-
frame cannot be overstated. I want to 
thank the brilliant men and women 
who made this feat possible. There are 
the researchers and scientists who de-
veloped the lifesaving vaccine, as well 
as the volunteers who participated in 
clinical trials. There are the manufac-
turers that are rapidly producing mil-
lions of doses and distributors who are 
getting those doses to sites across the 
country as quickly as possible. Of 
course, there are the hospitals, phar-
macies, and our incredible healthcare 
workers who will lead the vaccine ef-
fort. The race to a COVID vaccine will 
be remembered as one of the greatest 
human achievements of our generation, 
and these brave and brilliant individ-
uals helped make it possible. 
I want to remind all of us that while 
this is a huge milestone and one that 
should absolutely be celebrated, we are 
not out of the dark yet. The light at 
the end of the tunnel is getting bigger 
and brighter, but we still have a ways 
to go, and each of us has our own part 
to play in getting us there. For the 
American people, that means stopping 
the spread through the same habits 
that we learned all year—washing your 
hands, wearing a mask, practicing so-
cial distancing, and taking extra care 
to protect our most vulnerable friends 
and neighbors. Of course, this holiday 
season is not a time to forget the hab-
its we built over the last several 
months but to double down on them. 
While this is a development to be 
celebrated and a day we have been 
looking for for a long time, Congress 
has not yet done its job. For months on 
end, the American people have asked 
for additional financial support to 
weather this storm, and so far we have 
not seen any progress. Our Democratic 
colleagues blocked bill after bill, say-
ing more of the words of Speaker 
PELOSI: Nothing is better than some-
thing. 
Well, 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
stood in the way of investing more in 
vaccine distribution, extending unem-
ployment insurance benefits, helping 
our small businesses keep their work-
ers on payroll, and giving our schools 
the resources they need in order to pro-
vide education to our students safely. 
Our Democratic colleagues didn’t block 
these bills because they disagree with 
the content of the bills; they simply 
refuse to engage if we do not concede 
to their controversial and outrageous 
demands. 
At first, Democrats refused to back 
off the completely absurd bill passed in 
the House called the Heroes Act, which 
includes things like diversity studies 
for the marijuana industry and tax 
breaks for millionaires and billion-
aires. While they eventually realized 
how unrealistic their position was, 
they now stand firm in providing a 
bailout for cities and States that have 
been—some of which have been grossly 
mismanaged for decades. 
Over the last several months, our 
Democratic colleagues have repeatedly 
blocked legislation that would have 
poured half a trillion dollars more into 
our fight against COVID–19 because it 
didn’t include their far-fetched, par-
tisan priorities. Our Democratic col-
leagues have wasted a lot of time in 
playing games with this pandemic re-
lief, and the clock on this Congress is 
quickly running out. Congress needs to 
pass another bill this week, and I en-
courage our Democratic colleagues to 
start 
compromising 
and 
quit 
the 
grandstanding. They have shown us 
time and again, when you sit down at 
the negotiating table with an all-or- 
nothing attitude, the result is always 
nothing, and that is all they have to 
show for their obstruction over the last 
months since we passed the CARES 
Act. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. President, on another topic, last 
Friday, another important thing hap-
pened—the Senate passed the National 
Defense Authorization Act with broad 
bipartisan support and sent it to the 
President for his signature. This marks 
the 60th year in a row that we have 
completed the defense spending bill, 
and that is as it should be. Our na-
tional security is the No. 1 priority 
here in Washington, DC, and for our en-
tire Nation. 
Texas servicemembers will receive 
higher salaries and stronger support 
for their families because of this legis-
lation. That includes assistance for 
military spouses whose careers involve 
relicensing, and it includes high-qual-
ity childcare on military bases. This 
legislation will also bring some serious 
updates and improvements to Texas 
military bases. Joint Base San Anto-
nio, Joint Bases Fort Worth and Fort 
Hood, and the Pantex Plant in Ama-
rillo will all receive additional funding 
for updates and facilities to improve 
their capabilities and mission readi-
ness.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7457 
December 14, 2020 
Given the uncertain state of today’s 
world, preserving our military readi-
ness has never been more important. 
Russia is growing more aggressive in 
its efforts to disrupt the global order. 
North Korea continues to provoke the 
United States and our allies with its 
nuclear aspirations. Iran’s hostile and 
unpredictable actions threaten democ-
racies around the world, not just in the 
Middle East. China has become increas-
ingly powerful and more belligerent 
than ever. The Defense Authorization 
Act is how we prepare to counter these 
growing threats at every corner of the 
globe and improve our national secu-
rity across the board. We do that 
through the time-honored notion of 
peace through strength. The best way 
to avoid a war is for America to remain 
strong. 
I am incredibly proud that this legis-
lation includes language from a bill I 
introduced 
with 
Senators 
WARNER, 
COTTON, and SCHUMER—a bipartisan 
bill. The goal of this legislation is 
straightforward—to 
bring 
semicon-
ductor manufacturing back to the 
United States. Since 2000, the United 
States has dropped from producing 
roughly a quarter of the world’s semi-
conductors now down to about 12 per-
cent, and the semiconductors that 
make up your iPhone or that go into 
an F–35 are sole-sourced from a Taiwan 
semiconductor 
manufacturing 
com-
pany, obviously located overseas. 
If we have learned one thing from 
this virus, it is of the vulnerability of 
our supply chains, and it doesn’t take a 
lot of imagination to understand, with 
the threat to our economy and the 
threat to our national security, that 
the sole-source supply chain should be 
disrupted. There are the obvious eco-
nomic consequences. Why buy these 
chips from other countries when we 
could be making them ourselves? We 
could boost an entire industry, includ-
ing high-paying jobs right here in the 
United States. As I said, that is only 
part of the equation, because semicon-
ductor manufacturing isn’t just about 
the economy and jobs; it is about na-
tional security. Chips aren’t just in 
televisions, dishwashers, and consumer 
electronics; they are a vital part of our 
cell towers, missile defense systems, 
and other critical infrastructure. 
If you need an example of just how 
important it is to have a reliable sup-
ply of our most crucial devices, just 
look at the PPE shortage during the 
COVID–19 crisis. China has long been a 
supplier of masks, gloves, gowns, and 
other personal protective equipment 
used primarily by our healthcare work-
ers. For a long time, that wasn’t really 
a problem, but then COVID–19 showed 
that it was a problem. 
By the time the virus began to move 
across the United States, China had 
been battling it for months. So when it 
came time for American hospitals and 
clinics and healthcare providers to beef 
up their supplies of PPE, their supplies 
had already been depleted. Healthcare 
workers, you will recall, were reusing 
masks throughout an entire shift in 
order to conserve supplies, and hos-
pitals were pleading with the general 
public to donate any unused personal 
protective equipment to help keep 
healthcare workers safe. We didn’t 
reach that point because of a lack of 
preparation by hospitals but because of 
our 
reliance 
on 
vulnerable 
supply 
chains—notably, 
out 
of 
China—to 
produce that gear. 
Now imagine a supply chain break-
down happening for every industry 
that relies on semiconductors. Every-
thing 
from 
healthcare, 
to 
tele-
communications, to agriculture, to 
manufacturing would be paralyzed by a 
disruption of that supply chain. So one 
thing this virus has taught us, among 
other things, is to eliminate those sup-
ply chain vulnerabilities, and it is a 
clear signal that we need to take ac-
tion to secure other critical supply 
chains beyond just semiconductors. 
The inclusion of this provision in the 
NDAA was a strong start. We had a 
great vote of 96 Senators voting for the 
inclusion of this provision in the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act— 
strong bipartisan support. This provi-
sion in the NDAA will help restore 
American leadership in semiconductor 
manufacturing by creating a Federal 
incentive program through the Depart-
ment of Commerce to encourage chip 
manufacturing here. It will stimulate 
domestic 
advanced 
semiconductor 
manufacturing and boost both our na-
tional security and global competitive-
ness. It will enable us to bring manu-
facturing jobs back to American soil so 
we can reduce our reliance on China 
and 
other 
foreign 
countries 
and 
strengthen the supply chains of our 
most critical industries. 
Now comes the hard part—we have to 
pay for it. On Friday afternoon, I spoke 
with Secretary Pompeo and Secretary 
Ross about this legislation from, as I 
said, both national security and eco-
nomic perspectives. Last month, the 
Commerce Department sent a report to 
the Committee on Appropriations de-
tailing its plans to implement a semi-
conductor 
manufacturing 
incentive 
program. For everything from the au-
thorities that will be used to establish 
the program to the coordination with 
industry leaders, the Commerce De-
partment is ready to hit the ground 
running. Both the Secretary of State 
and the Secretary of Commerce agree— 
Congress must act soon and back these 
programs with funding. 
It is estimated that China will spend 
$250 billion on semiconductor manufac-
turing in the coming years. If left un-
matched, it will control 80 percent of 
the semiconductor manufacturing mar-
ket. If that happens, the United States 
will not be able to recover lost ground, 
which is why it is critical that we act 
now. Thankfully, with the help of pri-
vate industry here in the United 
States, we can do more with less. We 
can stop the slide of manufacturing 
power to China if we put even 10 per-
cent of what China is spending toward 
this essential element of our national 
security and our economic competi-
tiveness. 
The Senate passed this amendment 
over the summer with overwhelming 
support. I hope my colleagues on both 
sides will join me in continuing to 
fight to secure funding for this bipar-
tisan priority, which will bring manu-
facturing jobs back to the United 
States and close a glaring and dan-
gerous national security gap. 
I yield the floor.

for over a year, Senator JOHNSON and I 
investigated the Biden family’s finan-
cial dealings. For over a year, the lib-
eral media and my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle falsely said that 
we 
were 
peddling 
Russian 
disinformation. They ginned up any 
story they could to falsely portray our 
investigation 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
delegitimize the report’s findings. Even 
my colleague Senator WYDEN, with 
whom I have worked on many bipar-
tisan investigations, said the following: 
This disinformation also became the basis 
of the Johnson-Grassley investigation. The 
political nature of this investigation has 
been clear all along. Bottom line: The John-
son-Grassley investigation is baseless. It is 
laundering Russian propaganda for circula-
tion in the United States. 
It seems the liberal media and Demo-
crats have a very nervous tick. Any 
time a Republican gets close to the 
truth and is about to serve justice, the 
other 
side 
yells: 
‘‘Russian 
disinformation.’’ Of course, as we see 
now, that is a load of garbage. 
As I have said on this floor several 
times before, our report was rooted in 
information from U.S. Government 
agencies and a left-aligned U.S. lobby 
shop 
that 
represented 
a 
corrupt 
Ukrainian gas company, and by now, 
the American people know that it is 
really the Democrats and liberal media 
that 
are 
connected 
to 
Russian 
disinformation. 
Just 
think 
of 
the 
Steele dossier. It was infected with 
Russian disinformation and paid for by 
the Democratic National Committee 
and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. 
The liberal media and those on the 
other side of the aisle were scared of 
the facts. They were scared that the 
American people would see the Biden 
family’s deep and extensive link to for-
eign governments, including the Com-
munist Chinese Government. 
And once Senator JOHNSON and I re-
leased publically our findings, those 
same liberal outlets said the report re-
packaged old material and that there 
wasn’t really anything new to it.

December 14, 2020 
They went into full Joe Biden protec-
tion mode, and they didn’t even try to 
hide it. 
One Washington Post columnist said: 
‘‘Even after accepting disinformation 
from Russian agents, JOHNSON
and 
GRASSLEY couldn’t come up with any-
thing new or interesting on Hunter 
Biden.’’ 
Well, we know today the Post should 
be ashamed that they said that. 
POLITICO ran a story with this head-
line: ‘‘GOP Senators’ anti-Biden report 
repackages old claims.’’ 
And 
National 
Public 
Radio 
said 
about the New York Post Hunter Biden 
stories: ‘‘We don’t want to waste our 
time on stories that are not really sto-
ries, and we don’t want to waste the 
listeners’ and readers’ time on stories 
that are just pure distractions,’’ end of 
the NPR quote. 
Now, look at what Twitter and 
Facebook did to Hunter Biden news. 
Simply said, they interfered in the 
election and gave the Biden campaign 
a multimillion-dollar in-kind donation, 
courtesy 
of 
their 
blatant 
and 
unforgiveable censorship. 
So, my fellow Americans, let us 
never 
forget 
what 
Twitter 
and 
Facebook did during the 2020 elections. 
Now, let’s fast forward to this very 
day. Now it is confirmed that Hunter 
Biden is under criminal investigation, 
reportedly for his taxes and financial 
dealings—the very fact pattern that we 
described in the Johnson-Grassley re-
port. 
It shouldn’t take Hunter Biden to 
confirm that he is under criminal in-
vestigation 
before 
the 
mainstream 
press gets permission—from whom, I 
don’t know—to report the news. It is a 
complete outrage the way the liberal 
media used its power to cover up facts 
relating to Hunter Biden and the Biden 
family and, yet, ran story after story 
with false information about the Rus-
sian investigation into Trump and the 
credibility of the Steele dossier. 
The recent news also shows that our 
report was not ‘‘baseless’’—that is the 
word that shows up all the time—and it 
didn’t ‘‘repackage old claims.’’ That is 
another set of words that showed up 
quite regularly as people were trying 
to distract the Johnson and Grassley 
report. 
So quite the opposite—our report was 
well-founded, ahead of the curve, and 
right on the money, in more ways than 
one. 
Our report teed up the facts, but the 
mainstream press never stepped up to 
the plate. 
Some of the Nation’s supposedly 
leading press outlets, with teams of in-
vestigative reporters, were scooped by 
the Congress—the Johnson-Grassley re-
port. Now, of course, they are scram-
bling to chase the story that they for 
so long ignored. 
Now, it didn’t have to be this way. 
We already did much of the heavy lift-
ing before issuing our report. The re-
port made public information that 
hadn’t ever been known before. For ex-
ample, it showed the following: Hunter 
Biden and his associates and family 
members were connected to Chinese 
nationals 
and 
Chinese 
companies 
linked with the Communist Party and 
the People’s Liberation Army. This in-
cludes the CEFC China Energy Com-
pany Limited and that company’s sub-
sidiaries. 
Records show that a company linked 
to the Communist regime sent Hunter 
Biden’s law firm millions of dollars. 
Other records show that Hunter 
Biden opened a line of credit with a 
Chinese national linked to the Com-
munist regime and funded it with ap-
proximately $100,000. Then he, James 
Biden, and Sara Biden went on an ex-
travagant global spending spree. 
Still other records show that Hunter 
Biden, via his law firm, also sent a mil-
lion dollars to James Biden’s con-
sulting firm, the Lion Hall Group. 
These transfers began less than 1 week 
after CEFC sent $5 million to a com-
pany called Hudson West III, a com-
pany linked to CEFC and Chinese na-
tionals associated with the Communist 
regime, which then sent money to Hun-
ter Biden’s law firm. 
When the bank contacted Sara Biden, 
who was associated with the firm’s 
bank account, she refused to answer 
their questions and provide any addi-
tional documentation. According to 
the records that we have on file, the 
bank submitted the account for clo-
sure. 
Senator 
JOHNSON
and 
I 
recently 
issued a supplemental to our report 
that showed Hunter Biden’s close busi-
ness associate Rob Walker received $6 
million from a Chinese company linked 
to the Communist regime. 
There is yet another link in the 
chain from the Biden family and their 
associates to the Chinese Government. 
The report also showed that State 
Department 
officials 
believed 
that 
Hunter Biden’s Burisma board member-
ship created the perception of a con-
flict of interest and was ‘‘very awk-
ward for all U.S. officials pushing an 
anticorruption agenda in Ukraine,’’ 
end of quote from a State Department 
official. 
Secretary of State Kerry publicly de-
nied knowing of Hunter Biden’s role on 
the Burisma board. We acquired evi-
dence that shows that Kerry did, in 
fact, know about that role. 
In December 2015, instead of fol-
lowing U.S. objectives of confronting 
oligarchs, Vice President Biden’s staff 
advised him to avoid commenting on 
Burisma’s oligarch and instead say: ‘‘I 
am not going to get into naming names 
or accusing individuals.’’ 
Joe 
Biden 
was 
running 
an 
anticorruption agenda in Ukraine, and 
he pulled his punches while his son was 
on the board of Burisma. 
Based 
on 
witness 
testimony, 
Burisma’s owner allegedly paid a $7 
million bribe to officials serving under 
Ukraine’s prosecutor general to shut 
the case against him. When he alleg-
edly paid that bribe, Hunter Biden was 
on the Burisma board. 
These examples are just a sampling 
from the report that Senator JOHNSON 
and I put out and just the tip of the 
iceberg with respect to the Biden fam-
ily’s troubled ties to governments ad-
verse to U.S. interests. 
These associations, and the millions 
of dollars that passed between and 
among Hunter Biden, James Biden, and 
others, create criminal financial, coun-
terintelligence, 
and 
extortion 
con-
cerns. That is why I have written to 
the Justice Department about the risk 
that Hunter and James Biden essen-
tially served as agents of the Com-
munist government for purposes of 
their registering under the Foreign 
Agents Registration Act. 
After Hunter Biden publicly con-
firmed he was under criminal inves-
tigation, liberal news outlets reported 
on concerns that his financial associa-
tions could create criminal financial 
and 
counterintelligence 
problems— 
something you heard from the John-
son-Grassley report several weeks ago. 
That is what we said in September 2020, 
and we were roundly criticized for it. 
And just over the weekend, a new 
email was made public that reportedly 
says that Joe Biden and his brother 
were ‘‘office mates’’ with the very 
same Chinese nationals whom we wrote 
about in our report. Those same indi-
viduals were the ones with links to the 
Communist regime and that regime’s 
military. 
Based on all the facts known to date, 
Joe Biden has a lot of explaining to do. 
I have run many oversight operations 
and investigations during the course of 
my career. I am interested in the facts, 
in the evidence, and in the truth. I 
learned a lesson a long time ago when 
I first started my oversight focus; that 
is, no matter how difficult the media or 
the other side of the aisle makes it to 
find the facts, never give up. Keep 
working hard. The American taxpayers 
deserve nothing less. 
That is the attitude and approach 
that I have had my entire career, and 
that is what I will take with me as I 
continue to look into the Biden family 
matters and as I move to a leadership 
position on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF SANDY HOOK 
SHOOTING 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, 8 
years ago this morning, I was in 
Bridgeport, CT. I had done an event 
early that morning with the mayor, 
and I was due to meet my wife and my 
two children—then 4 years old and 1— 
on a train platform in Bridgeport to 
head down to New York City, to spend 
the rest of that Friday afternoon with 
my young kids, their first chance to 
see the Christmas decorations of the 
city. 
I received a phone call while on the 
train platform telling me that some-
thing had happened in Sandy Hook, CT. 
Sandy Hook is a section of Newtown, 
CT.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7459 
December 14, 2020 
I debated whether or not to still go 
down to New York, but as the news 
started to become more clear, I got in 
the car and headed up to the firehouse 
just down a short road from Sandy 
Hook Elementary School, where an 
emergency response effort was gath-
ering. 
It was there that 20 parents found out 
what had happened inside that school, 
as the rest of the world was finding out 
that same gruesome news. 
That was 8 years ago today—mark 
today—that tragic anniversary of the 
shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary 
School. 
Since that day, I have gotten to 
know those families—the mothers and 
the fathers of the children who were 
killed, the daughters, the siblings of 
educators who were killed. There were 
six educators inside Sandy Hook Ele-
mentary School who lost their lives 
that day—heroes all. There were 20 
children. I have also gotten to know 
the community of Sandy Hook even 
better than I ever had during my 6 
years representing them in the House 
of Representatives. 
Sandy Hook was and is a miraculous 
place. As much as the world saw evil 
that day, perpetuated by a young man 
named Adam Lanza, what happened in 
the hours and days, weeks and months 
following, in and around Sandy Hook, 
told us what really sits inside of us, 
and that is an indescribable goodness, 
an ability to meet evil with all sorts of 
generosity that poured on to Sandy 
Hook from all over the world in big 
ways and small ways. 
Teddy bears were sent in to Sandy 
Hook by the thousands in the days and 
weeks afterward. A fund was set up for 
the families of the victims. Millions of 
dollars went into that fund to help pay 
for the college educations of the broth-
ers and sisters who were left behind. 
The community wrapped its arms 
around those families, around the first 
responders. And while Sandy Hook will 
never ever be the same ever again, I 
was able to see firsthand what truly 
lies inside all of us. 
Over the last 8 years, we have tried 
to make good by the memory of those 
kids. There is no way to fill that hole, 
but I have watched as communities 
have been changed through the gen-
erosity that has come out of that trag-
edy. Almost every family established a 
unique not-for-profit that is doing all 
sorts of incredible work, all sort of 
based in many ways off of the loves of 
those children. 
There are charities that are building 
playgrounds for kids who love to climb 
and swing. There are charities that are 
providing access to animals for young 
kids in need, in memory of the kids 
who died that day who loved animals. 
There are charities that are building 
social-emotional help, trying to make 
sure that you never ever get in a situa-
tion ever again where a young man like 
Adam Lanza feels so separated from so-
ciety, his community, his peers, and re-
ality that someone thinks to do what 
he did. Just on the charitable side of 
the equation, there is so much over the 
last 8 years that has happened that has 
changed people’s lives, that has saved 
lives, because of what those families 
and what the community of Newtown 
has done. 
There has been policy change as well. 
We passed the Mental Health Reform 
Act in the U.S. Senate and in the 
House, and it was signed into law, one 
of the last things that President 
Obama did before he left office. 
Of course, we have had an ongoing 
conversation about the way in which 
we change our gun laws. Many of us in 
Connecticut have strong feelings that 
if Adam Lanza wasn’t able to get his 
hands as easily on a semi-automatic 
military-style weapon, he may not 
have ever made the journey to that 
school that morning. So we continue in 
our work to try to reset the gun laws of 
this Nation to try to make sure that no 
tragedy like that ever happens again 
simply because of ease of access to a 
weapon of that power. 
About a month after that shooting in 
Sandy Hook Elementary School, I had 
the chance to visit a community center 
in the North End of Hartford. I had just 
been sworn in as a Senator. The trag-
edy in Sandy Hook happened after my 
election to Senate but before I had 
been sworn in. After I was sworn in to 
the Senate, I went to a community 
center in the North End of Hartford 
where I met with the families of the 
victims of gun violence from that 
neighborhood. By the time Sandy Hook 
had happened in 2012, 20 young men and 
women had lost their lives to gunfire in 
Hartford. As for the families that we 
met that day, their hearts grieved 
deeper than anyone else for the fami-
lies in Sandy Hook because they knew 
what that pain is like. They had lost 
sons and daughters themselves. But 
they were also furious that the whole 
country was waking up to the epidemic 
of gun violence in this country after 
Newtown when it had been happening 
in Hartford and Bridgeport and New 
Haven and New Orleans and Chicago 
and Los Angeles and Baltimore for dec-
ades without much action and without 
much attention from the mainstream 
news media or from those in power. 
Many of us had to reconcile the ways 
in which we had spent our public career 
in the weeks and months after Sandy 
Hook. I am embarrassed by the fact 
that I didn’t do more when I was in the 
House of Representatives, that I didn’t 
do more when I was in the State legis-
lature, to try to address the epidemic 
of gun violence in this country, wher-
ever it happens. There were many peo-
ple in this Chamber who stood up in 
the wake of Sandy Hook and decided 
that they were going to lead—people 
like PAT TOOMEY and JOE MANCHIN—in 
ways that they hadn’t led before. 
I think we have all had to reassess 
our priorities. We have all had to think 
about whether we measured up to this 
moment that we live in today, where 
100 people died from gun violence and a 
lot of kids who go to school around this 
country just expect that, at some point 
in their young lives, they will be met 
with a mass shooting. So we come here 
8 years later, and we try to measure 
what has happened. Have we made 
enough change? And we try to recom-
mit ourselves to these ideas moving 
forward. 
I am proud of many of the things we 
have done. I am proud of all the chari-
table efforts, and I am proud of the 
Mental Health Reform Act, and I am 
proud we have put more money into 
school safety. I am proud that a lot of 
private-sector entities have stood up to 
stop weapons from being carried into 
public spaces. 
But I am also furious. I am also furi-
ous that there are easy, popular things 
that we could be doing to stop the like-
lihood of another Sandy Hook, to re-
duce the level of gun violence that hap-
pens in our city, and we choose not to 
take those steps. 
Now, universal background checks 
wouldn’t have saved the lives of those 
kids in Sandy Hook, but those parents 
came here and lobbied for that legisla-
tion in 2013 because they know that, if 
that legislation was in place, there 
would be a whole lot of other kids alive 
throughout this country because the 
flow of illegal guns would be stunted 
into our cities and many of our neigh-
borhoods. 
Those families in Sandy Hook don’t 
necessarily care how it gets done. They 
just want to make sure that there are 
less parents that ever have to go 
through what they have gone through. 
And despite the fact that 95 percent of 
Americans support something like uni-
versal background checks, we still 
haven’t done it here—an example of 
where democracy just doesn’t seem to 
be working. 
So we still have lots to do. I am sure 
I will get the opportunity over the 
course of 2021 to talk a lot about the 
path forward on changing our gun laws. 
But the final thing that I want to say 
today, before I yield the floor to Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL, is that for those 
Americans who haven’t had to come 
face-to-face with a tragedy like that, 
maybe for those who haven’t been 
around that kind of pain and sorrow, 
maybe it is a little bit hard to under-
stand perspective. One of the things we 
have tried to do in the last 8 years is, 
on this day—the 1-year, the 2-year, the 
3-year, the 4-year, and now the 8-year 
mark—to just ask people on this day to 
go out and do something nice for a 
friend, for a relative, for a stranger. 
Just act in a kind, generous way, and 
maybe, over the course of the next 
year, make it a habit to do a little bit 
more than you would have done other-
wise to help people in and around you 
in the ways that people helped the 
community of Sandy Hook—the par-
ents, the relatives—in small and big 
ways in the wake of the tragedy 8 years 
ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7460 
December 14, 2020 
When you are around that kind of 
loss and pain, when you think about 
what it is like to lose a child, I think 
it helps to give some perspective as to 
what is really important in this world. 
We have a habit in this business to 
treat each other unkindly, and I am 
guilty of that, just like everyone else 
in this body is. Especially these days, 
we tend to fall into this trap too easily 
in which we assume bad motives of 
folks who just think differently than 
us. There are some folks out there 
today who won’t go to businesses that 
are owned by Republicans or won’t as-
sociate themselves with folks who 
might have more progressive views 
than they have. Politics matter. Don’t 
get me wrong. But there are things 
that matter more than politics. And 
when we think about what those fami-
lies are going through today as they 
are forced to relive the events of that 
day at Sandy Hook Elementary School, 
we should be reminded of how lucky we 
are to still be on this Earth; for those 
who haven’t endured that kind of loss, 
how lucky we are to still have our chil-
dren by our side. And we should re-
member that kindness, treating people 
respectfully, understanding what is im-
portant in the long run—family, friend-
ships, relationships—that is one of the 
lessons, I hope, of Sandy Hook. 
So this is never a fun day to come 
down to the floor and mark the anni-
versary of Sandy Hook, but I want to 
finish by just saying thank you to the 
parents and the families for letting 
Senator BLUMENTHAL and I into their 
lives. 
I have these friendships, these bonds 
with those families today that I never 
expected but now may be more mean-
ingful to me than any other relation-
ships that I have. And I do have strong 
words often for my colleagues about 
our unwillingness to make change in 
this body, but it is because, when my 
public service is done, the measure of 
whether I succeeded or failed, to me, in 
many ways is in the hands of those 
families. Whether they think that I 
have made a difference to honor the 
memory of their children is probably 
what will matter to me more than any-
thing else when I hang up my public 
service spikes a few years from now—5 
years from now, 10 years from now. 
I thank them for enduring this pain, 
for reaching out to those of us in posi-
tions of leadership to help guide us, 
and for finding all sorts of ways to lift 
up the light and the memory of their 
children, of their parents, of those that 
fell 8 years ago today in Sandy Hook. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, let me begin where Senator MUR-
PHY so eloquently finished. 
One of the great honors of my life has 
been to know and cherish the friend-
ship of the wonderful parents and loved 
ones of those 20 beautiful children and 
sixth grade educator that perished 8 
years ago today. And I have been proud 
to work with Senator MURPHY, a true 
champion of stopping gun violence, in 
our efforts over these last 8 years. 
That day began for them as it has 
begun for all of us as parents—for me 
as a parent of four, for Senator MUR-
PHY as a dad of two—making breakfast, 
dropping off kids, heading to work. 
Among the beautiful holiday orna-
ments that decorated Newtown and 
Sandy Hook on that day—it was a nor-
mal day, until it wasn’t. It was a nor-
mal day until those minutes when life 
changed irreparably for those parents 
and loved ones and for us. 
Yes, I had championed the cause of 
gun violence prevention for years be-
fore that day. As State attorney gen-
eral, I began lawsuits; I supported the 
cause of banning the assault weapons 
in Connecticut and defending that ban 
in our State courts. But that day 
changed us forever. 
We went to Sandy Hook, and what we 
saw was unspeakable grief, pain, and 
anguish that still haunt me. What I 
saw that afternoon will stay with me 
not just as a source of grief and pain 
but also as a cry for action, as an unde-
niable mandate for action to honor 
with action those beautiful lives—to 
honor them not just with words, 
speeches, rhetoric, but with real ac-
tion. 
For all of us, random acts of kindness 
are within our reach. Those acts of 
kindness to commemorate the gentle 
beauty and grace and dignity, the love 
and laughter, the futures that were 
lost—that is not just an expression of 
pain and grief; it is a moral imperative. 
With grief comes trauma and lifelong 
scars that never fade. But what I saw 
in those hours after that brutal, un-
imaginable massacre was also unspeak-
able goodness—the first responders who 
came and saw the carnage that brought 
tears to their eyes, the fire and police 
service, the community leaders, the 
men and women of faith. Father Bob 
Weiss, now monsignor, brought us to-
gether that evening in St. Rose of 
Lima Church when the grief and pain 
were raw, as raw as the cold of that 
winter night, and so many came—in 
fact, so many that they couldn’t fit in 
the church. They heard it by loud 
speaker outside, and I said: The world 
is watching. 
In fact, the world watched with awe 
because Sandy Hook came to show the 
resilience and courage and strength of 
those families who have championed 
this cause of preventing gun violence 
but also launched foundations and phil-
anthropic efforts in the names and 
memories of their children to do good 
and to change lives for the better. They 
are resilient and strong like Newtown 
is resilient and strong. 
This morning, in a vigil done vir-
tually, led by Connecticut Against Gun 
Violence, we celebrated the lives not 
only of those 20 beautiful children and 
sixth grade educators but everyone in 
Connecticut over the past year who has 
died from gun violence because no com-
munity is immune from it. It strikes 
every neighborhood and area of our 
State and of our country. So honoring 
with action is something that we must 
do in this body. 
One of the memories that also haunts 
me is of the day when we came within 
a few votes of passing a universal back-
ground check bill—almost 55 votes but 
not enough to reach 60, a majority of 
the Senate but not enough for cloture. 
And from that Gallery, literally, came 
the shout: Shame. Indeed, shame— 
shame on us in the U.S. Senate for 
being 
complicit 
in 
the 
continuing 
deaths of thousands over these past 8 
years, thousands that could have been 
prevented, and thousands that have our 
culpability. Shame on us for failing to 
honor with action and to move forward 
on universal background checks and 
emergency orders—emergency risk pro-
tection orders. Those two steps keep 
guns out of the hands of dangerous peo-
ple who would do harm to themselves 
through suicide, as well as to others in 
the shootings that take place on our 
streets and our neighborhoods. 
Connecticut has led the way on those 
measures and others—Ethan’s Law for 
safe storage, a ban on assault weapons 
and high-capacity magazines, ghost 
gun bans, and other measures that es-
sentially make our neighborhoods and 
lives safer. But even Connecticut, with 
the strongest gun measures in the 
country, is no safer than any State 
with the weakest because guns have no 
respect for State boundaries. They 
cross State lines, and the ‘‘crime guns’’ 
that come into Connecticut are the 
source of those shootings that kill our 
people. 
So there are simple, straightforward 
steps that we can take—commonsense 
measures, including stopping the near-
ly complete, unprecedented immunity 
of gun manufacturers from any legal 
responsibility and making sure that 
they bear liability for the deaths that 
they cause. 
Our lives have never been the same 
since Sandy Hook. But in the wake of 
that tragedy—as well as Parkland, Las 
Vegas, Charleston, El Paso, Orlando, 
and Pittsburgh, and countless others, 
mass shootings, individual deaths— 
there has grown a movement, and it is 
a movement led by young people and 
by people who care about this cause 
without partisan politics. It is a new 
generation of leaders. It is a movement 
born of that grief and pain and anger— 
the fury of knowing that democracy is 
not working, the tenacity born of the 
injustice of those deaths and injuries 
and trauma. They are fighting to make 
sure that what happened at Sandy 
Hook or any of those other places 
never happens again. It is a new class 
of heroes, and their time is now. 
Their 
organizations 
are 
diverse: 
Moms Demand Action, Students De-
mand Action, March for Our Lives, Gif-
fords, Connecticut Against Gun Vio-
lence, Newtown Action Alliance, and 
Sandy Hook Promise. These are just a 
few of them, and they are a movement, 
and they are causing a change in the

consciousness of America so that now 
more than 90 percent of Americans sup-
port universal background checks. 
A comparable number support emer-
gency risk protection orders known as 
red flag statutes. Seventeen States now 
have them and increased substantially 
after Parkland, and they are not alone. 
They are joined by survivors from 
countless 
communities—too 
many 
communities. They are joined by law 
enforcement officials, first responders, 
and emergency room nurses and doc-
tors who have the firsthand education 
about what gun violence does to a 
human body and a human mind. They 
are joined also by advocates and activ-
ists and community leaders from every 
community across the country because 
this epidemic affects everyone. They 
are the true leaders of this movement, 
and I am proud to stand with them 
today as I do every day. 
My hope is that a new Congress will 
break this complicity and that we will 
move forward, that a new Congress will 
break the inaction, and then a new 
President will change the dynamic, not 
only in this Congress but in the coun-
try, and take advantage of the historic 
opportunity we have. 
With a new administration, we have 
not only this momentous opportunity 
but also a moral imperative. We have 
that opportunity to enact strong, com-
monsense 
gun 
violence 
prevention 
measures and, in addition, although no 
substitute for legislative action, strong 
Executive action to enhance the effec-
tiveness of background checks, to stop 
the spread of ghost guns, to take other 
measures that are within the power of 
the President alone, and to make sure 
that we explore and use every possible 
opportunity. 
The States will continue acting alone 
if the Federal Government fails to join 
them. States like Connecticut and oth-
ers around the country who want to 
protect their citizens will continue to 
be proactive. 
We mark this painful anniversary 
with renewed resolve—resolve to con-
tinue to honor, with positive action, 
those whose lives were lost at Sandy 
Hook but also to redouble our efforts 
to educate and enlist our fellow citi-
zens. It is long past time; 8 years is a 
long time—much too long for this inac-
tion. 
Our hearts still ache. Our anger still 
burns. Our grief and pain are still 
there. For those families, they will 
never go away. But make no mistake, 
this pandemic is no excuse for inaction. 
If anything, COVID–19 has raised the 
number of gun purchases and increased 
the number of guns posing dangers in 
our neighborhoods. It has heightened 
the stress and anxiety of people who 
might use those guns in incidents of 
domestic violence. It has expanded the 
jeopardies of suicide and self-destruc-
tive behavior. 
We have no excuse for inaction be-
cause of the pandemic. We have every 
reason to feel a greater sense of ur-
gency now, in the midst of this pan-
demic, to stop the epidemic of gun vio-
lence. 
Let us draw from the strength and 
fortitude of these brave families and 
loved ones—not only in Sandy Hook 
but survivors and loved ones every-
where—and 
say, 
finally, 
boldly, 
unapologetically, 
that 
enough 
is 
enough. Enough is enough. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
COLLEGIATE ATHLETE AND COMPENSATION 
RIGHTS ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, those of you who have taken time 
out to watch college sports this fall— 
and I know there are many in this 
Chamber who have, and they know that 
the games this year have looked very 
different when you compare them to 
previous years’ games. A lot has 
changed for these young players, but 
they are no less popular with their fans 
and no less important to the success 
and prominence of the academic insti-
tutions they represent. 
For a while now, I have been joined 
by other members of the Commerce 
Committee as we have tried to resolve 
the tension that exists between the 
NCAA and college sports stars over a 
student athlete’s right to earn com-
pensation for the use of their name, 
image, or likeness. This is called the 
NIL issue. 
Last week, Senator WICKER, who is 
chairman of the Commerce Committee, 
introduced the Collegiate Athlete and 
Compensation Rights Act, which would 
finally 
create 
a 
uniform 
national 
framework to allow student athletes to 
receive that compensation without the 
risk of losing their amateur status and 
without falling into traps set by dis-
honest outside parties looking to ex-
ploit their fame. 
Normally, we don’t make too much 
hay over a bill introduction, but just 
getting everyone to the table is a first 
step that student athletes have wanted 
to see happen for a while. And I thank 
Chairman WICKER and Senator MORAN 
for backing this legislation. 
I do want to point out that the rea-
son the Senate has stepped in is be-
cause the NCAA just never could get 
around to addressing this issue. They 
kept kicking the can down the road. 
They kept sending it to one committee 
and to another committee, and the 
NCAA has shown very little determina-
tion to solve this issue for these young 
athletes. Because the leadership at the 
NCAA has proven unable and has 
shown an inability to address this, we 
have stepped up to address this issue. 
Our student athletes deserve more re-
spect than they have been shown by 
the NCAA. 
(Mr. BOOZMAN assumed the Chair.) 
WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE 
Now, Mr. President, on another topic, 
2020 has been a very difficult year, but 
there have been a few rays of sunshine 
this year in spite of the quarantines 
and the social distancing. 
We were still able to celebrate the 
100th anniversary of the 19th Amend-
ment and the suffragists who fought so 
diligently and consistently for 72 years 
for passage of the 19th Amendment. 
Much of this celebration of activism 
and equal rights focused on Nashville, 
TN, where the suffragists gathered in 
the summer of 1920. At the center of 
that battle for the votes sat the Her-
mitage Hotel, which served as the 
headquarters and played host to some 
of the most important negotiations 
surrounding the Tennessee Legisla-
ture’s final vote on the amendment. 
This year, the National Park Service 
honored the Hermitage Hotel and the 
suffragists who fought those battles by 
designating the site as a national his-
toric landmark. As a female lawmaker, 
this designation was especially impor-
tant to me. This Congress, I had the 
pleasure of serving here in the Senate 
alongside a fantastic group of women 
who were living proof of how far we 
have come since August 18, 1920. 
Unfortunately, this year we were also 
reminded of how far we yet have to go. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, even before President 
Trump 
officially 
nominated 
Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett to fill Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme 
Court, liberals in the media and many 
of my colleagues on the other side of 
the 
aisle 
unfortunately—well, 
they 
took it upon themselves to be the first 
to question Judge Barrett’s fitness. 
But rather than attacking her record, 
they launched some truly insulting at-
tacks on her religion, her family, her 
relationship with her husband, and her 
choice to balance a stunning career 
with a large, blended family. 
You can count on the left to choose 
intellectual isolation, and you can 
count on them to look at a woman on 
the political right and say: If you are 
pro-family, pro-religion, pro-business, 
pro-military, pro-life, we do not want 
to hear from you. 
Those attacks may have made the 
American people cringe, but they cer-
tainly 
didn’t 
turn 
public 
opinion 
against Judge Barrett’s confirmation. 
That campaign failed miserably. If 
anything, it provided a much needed 
reminder that, just like the fight for 
suffrage in the 1920s, the modern wom-
an’s fight for equality in 2020 is about 
more than succeeding in a single job or 
engaging in a single civic action; it is 
about exercising our right to partici-
pate in democracy and engage in the 
public square without having to throw 
ourselves at the mercy of the left’s 
moving goalpost that they use to arbi-
trarily define what is and is not an ac-
ceptable way of life. 
Justice Barrett is now the third Jus-
tice President Trump has placed on the 
Supreme Court. She is in good com-
pany because she is part of a class of 
229 Federal judges confirmed so far 
under President Trump, 144 of them 
during this Congress. And I expect that 
we will see a few more join the ranks 
before we adjourn for Christmas, in-
cluding two Tennesseans who are on 
this list.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7462 
December 14, 2020 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, I would be remiss if I 
did not remind my colleagues that we 
still have a lot to do before we adjourn. 
This weekend’s announcements about 
the first round of COVID–19 vaccines 
heading out for delivery were a very 
welcome addition to the news cycle. 
We owe a great deal of credit to the 
doctors and scientists who developed 
the vaccines; to those working behind 
the scenes through Operation Warp 
Speed to get those safe, effective vac-
cines approved; and to the truck-
drivers, the shipping professionals, cold 
storage developers, and other essential 
workers pushing through a whole lot of 
overtime to get these vaccines in the 
hands of healthcare providers. 
This 
morning, 
I 
was 
fortunate 
enough to stop by the grand opening of 
Cold Chain Technologies’ Wilson Coun-
ty, TN, facility. The technology they 
have developed to preserve and trans-
port these vaccines in a thermal con-
tainer is truly impressive. 
But don’t forget that all across this 
country, millions of small business 
men and women and struggling work-
ers are still waiting for us to agree on 
and pass another targeted—and I will 
say targeted—COVID relief legislation. 
When I talked to Tennesseans this 
weekend, they aren’t worried about 
politics or optics or unassociated wish 
list items. They want to see another 
round of PPP. They want to see a plus- 
up in unemployment insurance. They 
want to see money for vaccines, for 
testing, and for schools so that people 
can get back to work and children can 
get back to school. That is the relief 
Americans are looking for. And, I will 
add, the hesitancy from some across 
the aisle and over in the House Cham-
ber, where they have admitted to play-
ing politics with people’s lives, has not 
set well with Tennesseans as we enter 
this Christmas season. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO THOMAS WILSON 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, this 
evening I want to take just a moment, 
in front of my colleagues, to recognize 
the contributions of a member of my 
staff: Thomas Wilson. Mr. Wilson has 
spent the last year working in our per-
sonal office as part of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs Congressional Fel-
lowship Program. 
As Thomas departs my office and re-
turns to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, I want to express my apprecia-
tion to him for his hard work and the 
dedication to serve veterans in Kansas 
and across the Nation. Thomas has 
served at the VA for more than 18 
years. His selfless approach to service 
has helped countless veterans receive 
the care and support that they have 
earned. He has surely been an asset to 
my team as we work to serve Kansans, 
servicemembers, and veterans. 
Before joining our office, Thomas 
served as the legislative director to 
Congressman Harold Baker, a member 
of the House Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. He served on the Bush transi-
tion team after leaving congressional 
service and then went on to serve in 
numerous roles at the VA. These in-
cluded roles as a congressional liaison 
for the VA and, most recently, in the 
Veterans Experience Office. 
He is a graduate of the National De-
fense University and has used his expe-
rience to benefit those who serve our 
Nation in uniform. 
Thomas is fortunate to have his lov-
ing wife Ashley and son Chase by his 
side. They undoubtedly contribute to 
Thomas’s altruistic nature, and he is 
blessed to have their support. 
Thomas joined my office in January 
2019, just as I was assuming the gavel 
of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. His experience navigating the 
VA proved immensely helpful to my 
personal and committee staffs as we 
set off to advocate for veterans from 
all walks of life. 
He was especially helpful in advo-
cating for women veterans. Thomas led 
the effort to study the employment 
rates of post-9/11 female veterans, a co-
hort of veterans that experiences high-
er unemployment rates, more than any 
other demographic. 
His efforts will lead to policies to 
support female veterans and to make 
certain that they have the tools nec-
essary to succeed after their service to 
our Nation. 
It is sad to see Thomas leave the of-
fice, but I know that his return to the 
Veterans Experience Office next month 
will produce lasting results for the 
many veterans who regularly interact 
with the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs. 
Thomas is an impressive public serv-
ant, and it has been a privilege to work 
with him. I hold him in the highest re-
gard. He is a significant asset to our 
veterans and represents some of the 
best that our Federal Government has 
to offer. 
Once again, thank you, Thomas, for 
all you have done for Kansans and for 
American veterans this year in associa-
tion with us and our work. You have 
been a model of selfless service and 
leadership, and I know you will con-
tinue to do great things throughout 
your career and your life of service, 
wherever that path may lead. 
WAIVING QUORUM CALL 
Mr. President, I also ask unanimous 
consent that the mandatory quorum 
call be waived. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion,

ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the

HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Katelyn Seeley, Natalie Para, 
and Victoria Chrostowski on winning the 2020 
Congressional App Challenge for Arizona’s 8th 
Congressional District. Their app, How Are 
You, asks users key questions about their 
emotional and physical well-being. Users can 
receive personalized responses based on their 
answers to specific questions that include tips 
and different forms of encouragement. The 
app also provides resources and guidance for 
individuals who may require further profes-
sional assistance. 
They were inspired to create their app in 
order to mitigate the increasing issue of men-
tal health, especially among those in their age 
group. 
Katelyn, Natalie, and Victoria are all seniors 
at Xavier Preparatory High School in Phoenix, 
Arizona. 
I am so honored to represent these bright 
young students in Congress.

IN HONOR OF DEIRDRE MARTIN 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Deirdre Martin as she departs 
from the Pacifica City Council where she 
served for four years, the last year as mayor. 
Serving as mayor of a small town is never an 
easy task, but it’s particularly challenging dur-
ing a pandemic not seen in a century. Deirdre 
took her responsibility to keep the residents of 
Pacifica safe very seriously and did a remark-
able job keeping them informed with regular 
updates, FAQs and informational videos. 
Running for city council takes true dedica-
tion to public service. Council members are 
paid a token amount of $400 a month and put 
in long hours of meetings, calls, events, and 
research, often while holding a full-time job. 
That is true in Deirdre’s case who is a senior 
IT project manager with the Pasha Group, a 
transportation and logistics management com-
pany based in Marin County. Additionally, she 
is raising two young children. How she found 
time to volunteer and serve on the council is 
a wonder and a testament to her passion to 
help others. 
During her time on the council, Deirdre has 
accomplished much, and much of it has been 
informed by her environmental and social ac-
tivism. She was instrumental in making 
Pacifica the first city in the county to ban sin-
gle use plastic and in officially recognizing it 
as a ‘‘Tree City USA’’ under the Arbor Day 
Foundation. Her efforts helped Pacifica re-
ceive a grant to make the new Bike and Pe-
destrian Master Plan a reality. Deirdre served 
for two years each on the Peninsula Clean 
Energy Board of Directors, the Open Space 
and Parkland Advisory Committee, the C/CAG 
Bike and Pedestrian Advisory Committee and 
the Emergency Preparation Committee. She 
also worked closely with her colleagues and 
the community on the Local Coastal Plan and 
the General Plan of the city. A strong oppo-
nent of offshore drilling, she helped implement 
language that divests the city from the fossil 
fuel industry. 
While working on environmental issues on 
the council, Deirdre still found time to continue 
her long membership in the Pacific Beach Co-
alition and she maintained her role as the site 
captain for Sharp Park Beach. I truly admire 
her commitment to clean air, clean water and 
our fight against climate change. I imagine 
that the last thing she ever imagined doing is 
to close down beaches during the COVID–19 
pandemic to keep residents and visitors safe. 
Deirdre is an avid advocate for government 
transparency, justice and equity. She has 
stood up for the rights of minority populations 
and immigrants. Motivated by the Black Lives 
Matter marches in protest of the killing of 
George Floyd this summer, she signed on to 
the Obama Foundation ‘‘My Brother’s Keeper’’ 
Mayoral Pledge and has collaborated closely 
with the Pacifica Police Department and com-
munity members to create a non-biased, non- 
racist environment. 
Pacifica, a beautiful beach town of about 
40,000, has faced fiscal challenges. The Great 
Recession of 2007, a series of El Nino storms 
in 2016 and the current COVID–19 pandemic 
have taken a toll on the city budget. Deirdre, 
along with her colleagues, have worked hard 
to bring new revenue to the city. A short-term 
rental tax and a sales tax for marijuana is esti-
mated to increase city revenue by more than 
$850,000. 
Madam Speaker, as Deirdre Martin is retir-
ing from the Pacifica City Council, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in thanking her for her 
service to the residents of Pacifica and San 
Mateo County. She will now have fewer Zoom 
calls to attend and will be able to spend more 
time with her husband Kai Martin and their two 
daughters Nova and Astra. However, I am cer-
tain she will remain active and engaged in 
pursuit of social and environmental justice for 
all. It has been my honor to serve with her.

HONORING MICHAEL MILLER, SR. 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraor-
dinary life and service of Michael Miller, Sr. 
Michael Miller leaves behind a significant 
legacy of advocacy for his community of 
Rodeo, California and on behalf of his broth-
ers and sisters in labor, with Phillips 66 United 
Steel Workers (USW) Local 326. Mr. Miller’s 
passion for community involvement and activ-
ism within Contra Costa County will leave a 
lasting impact. 
Mr. Miller worked for 30 years at the Phillips 
66 San Francisco Refinery in Maintenance, Oil 
Movements and Bulk Utilities, as well as on 
the Renewable Diesel project. A natural born 
leader, Mr. Miller served as president of USW 
326 for more than 10 years, advocating at the 
state and federal level for 250 workers who 
serve as the backbone of American industry 
and fighting to protect wages and jobs. Mr. 
Miller was a strong supporter of the Phillips 
66: Rodeo Renewed Project, which will con-
tinue to provide livable wage careers for the 
next generation of steelworkers. 
Mr. Miller’s dedication to his community ex-
tended beyond his work on labor rights advo-
cacy. For over a decade, Miller donned a red 
suit and white beard and played Santa Claus, 
bringing holiday cheer at many Contra Costa 
County events. He also donated his time to 
uplift those struggling families and neighbors 
in his community through his work with the 
New Horizons Career Development Center 
and his community engagement work with the 
Bayo Vista community. 
Madam Speaker, Michael Miller was the 
type of dedicated community member and 
leader we should all strive to be. His legacy 
leaves an opportunity for us all to become 
more involved in our communities and uphold 
the American dream. It is therefore fitting and 
proper that we honor him here today.

REFLECTIONS ON THE PROCESS 
ESTABLISHED BY THE FRAMERS 
FOR 
THE 
ELECTION 
OF 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
AND 
VICE-PRESI-
DENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to offer a few brief thoughts on the process 
established by the Framers for the election of 
the President and Vice-President of the United 
States and the certain outcome of that proc-
ess that will be known later today and ratified 
on in a Joint Meeting of Congress on January 
6, 2021. 
The impeached and electorally defeated in-
cumbent has amassed a 98 percent failure 
record (1/50) in his legal challenges to the cer-
tification of electors. 
Not to be outdone, the Texas Attorney Gen-
eral, joined by 17 Republican Attorneys Gen-
eral and 126 sitting Republican Members of 
Congress, filed a shameful, desperate Hail 
Mary action requesting the U.S. Supreme 
Court to disenfranchise 10 million voters in 
Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wis-
consin because they claim somehow by the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1138 
December 14, 2020 
local decision made by those sovereign states 
to protect their citizens from a lethal pandemic 
by permitting voting by mail. 
The Supreme Court summarily rejected this 
latest lawsuit, finding that petitioners lacked 
standing to bring their specious arguments. 
Madam Speaker, it defies belief that per-
sons claiming to revere the 10th Amendment 
and federalism would have taken this action 
that makes a mockery of their core beliefs and 
is so inconsistent with the bedrock principle 
that in America, it is ‘‘We, the People’’ who 
choose our leaders; leaders do not choose 
their voters. 
The principle behind this most frivolous of 
lawsuits would allow the absurd result of Cali-
fornia suing Texas for not expanding Med-
icaid, New York suing Mississippi for the way 
it runs its penal system, Illinois suing North 
Carolina for gerrymandering election districts, 
and Minnesota suing Alabama over its school 
funding mechanism. 
This latest Republican led and Trump-in-
spired law suit, like the preceding 50, was not 
grounded in reality so it is useful to describe 
what the Constitution and the law prescribe re-
garding the process for electing a president. 
First, it must be emphasized that while No-
vember 3 was Election Day throughout the na-
tion, it was not a national election but a series 
of discreet and separate elections held in each 
state and District of Columbia to choose the 
persons who under the 12th Amendment are 
to meet six weeks later to cast the votes to 
elect the President and Vice-President. 
The result of those elections was that Joe 
Biden was the leading vote-getter in more 
states with more people by larger margins 
than Donald Trump. 
In fact, the latest tally of all votes cast 
shows Joe Biden has received more votes, 
81.2 
million, 
than 
anyone 
in 
history, 
outdistancing his vanquished rival by an as-
tounding 7 million votes. 
Second, the next important date in the elec-
toral process is today, December 14, which is 
the first Monday after the second Wednesday 
and the date set by federal law, when the men 
and women chosen by the voters of their re-
spective states gather in the several state cap-
itals to cast their votes for President and Vice- 
President. 
While there are a number of events yet to 
take place that are required by the Constitu-
tion and our laws, it is beyond any reasonable 
dispute what the culmination of these events 
will yield: an announcement on January 6, 
2021 at a Joint Meeting of the Congress in the 
House of Representatives, by the President of 
the Senate, MIKE PENCE, to the nation and the 
world that Joseph R. Biden is elected as the 
46th President and that KAMALA D. HARRIS is 
elected the 49th Vice-President of the United 
States. 
While this meeting is popularly known as 
the Electoral College, it should be noted that 
this particular term is nowhere mentioned in 
the Constitution itself. 
Instead, the Electoral College should prop-
erly be understood as a process, not a place, 
for electing the President and the Vice-Presi-
dent. 
In every state, this process begins with the 
nomination by the state’s political parties of 
candidates for the position of presidential elec-
tor. 
Next, is the ascertainment of which slate of 
candidates were selected to be the electors, 
which in every state is determined by the out-
come of the presidential election held on the 
first Tuesday after the first Monday in the pre-
ceding November. 
After the electors have been ascertained, 
they are provided a writ of election by the 
state governor directing them to assemble in 
the state capital at a time specified on the first 
Monday after the second Wednesday in De-
cember to cast their votes for separately 
President and Vice-President. 
Any judicial disputes regarding the appoint-
ment of electors that are decided in accord-
ance with state laws in place before the elec-
tion at least six days in advance of the meet-
ing are conclusive are conclusive as to the va-
lidity of the appointment. 
Thirty-one states and the District of Colum-
bia by law require electors to cast their votes 
for the candidate of the political party that 
nominated them and most of the rest require 
the elector to sign a pledge committing him or 
her to do so, but again, since electors are typi-
cally faithful members or workers of the polit-
ical party that nominated them, such pledges 
merely state the obvious. 
As I speak, all 50 states and the District of 
Columbia have certified the results of the 
presidential election, and since this was done 
at least six days before the meeting of elec-
tors, under Section 5 of the Electoral College 
Act, 3 U.S.C. 1 et seq., it is conclusive on the 
issue of whether the electors in those states 
were ‘‘lawfully certified.’’ 
The Certificates of Ascertainment appointing 
the electors transmitted to the National Archi-
vist and the President of the Senate will docu-
ment that enough candidates nominated by 
his party were elected to cast at minimum 306 
electoral votes for Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS to be elected President and Vice- 
President of the United States, which is 36 
more than the needed 270 vote majority. 
Put another way, Joe Biden is slated to re-
ceive the exact number of electoral votes that 
were deemed to constitute a landslide, blow-
out, historic triumph by the current President 
just four short years ago. 
Third and finally, after the electors meet in 
the various state capitals next Monday, they 
will transmit their Certificates of Vote to the 
National Archivist where they will remain until 
opened on January 6, 2021 by Vice-President 
PENCE and counted in public before a Joint 
Meeting of the Congress. 
When all the votes are tabulated, the Vice- 
President will then announce and make official 
what we all know right to be true: Joe Biden 
has been elected the 46th President of the 
United States and KAMALA HARRIS has been 
elected the 49th Vice-President and President 
of the Senate. 
Two weeks later on January 20, at noon, on 
the steps of the West Front of the U.S. Cap-
itol, Joe Biden will be inaugurated and will 
enter office after taking the oath in which he 
will solemnly affirm that he ‘‘will faithfully exe-
cute the Office of President of the United 
States, and will to the best of my ability, pre-
serve, protect and defend the Constitution of 
the United States.’’ 
This outcome is not in doubt and no amount 
of suspending disbelief will make it so. 
It is all over but the shouting—and the pub-
lic counting of the electoral ballots in the Joint 
Meeting of the Congress on January 6, 2021. 
The center holds and the system is working 
as the Framers envisioned it. 
We can all celebrate that.

REMEMBERING ERVIN JULIAN 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Evie Nguyen of Glendale, Ari-
zona, on winning the 2020 Congressional Art 
Competition for Arizona’s 8th Congressional 
District. 
Evie’s artwork, completed in charcoal and ti-
tled ‘‘Mutual,’’ highlights the close relationship 
between humans and nature by showcasing 
herself with a Cactus Wren, Arizona’s state 
bird. 
Evie was a senior at Deer Valley High 
School when the artwork was completed. Her 
art is currently being displayed in the U.S. 
Capitol along with the other Congressional Art 
Competition winners from around the country. 
Each spring, I am proud to host the Con-
gressional Art Competition to showcase the in-
credibly talented students across Arizona’s 8th 
Congressional District. 
It is an honor to represent these promising 
young artists in Congress.

IN HONOR OF JESS ‘‘JAY’’ BENTON 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Jess ‘‘Jay’’ Benton as he departs 
the Hillsborough Town Council. Jay is deeply 
committed to serving his country and his com-
munity. 
During the Vietnam War, Jay served as an 
officer on the USS Lowe, a destroyer escort. 
He is a graduate of the University of Southern 
California and is a big Trojans fan. He cur-
rently serves on the Board of Leaders at the 
University of Southern California Marshall 
School of Business. 
He worked for 35 years for ABM Industries 
and retired as the Chief Operating Officer. In 
2003, he was appointed Co-Chairman of the 
Expert Review Committee for the California 
Business, Transportation and Housing Agency 
and in 2004 he was appointed by Governor 
Schwarzenegger to the California Performance 
Review Commission. For several years he 
also served on the Town of Hillsborough’s fi-
nancial advisory board which, as a practical 
matter, offers the expert advice of global finan-
cial investors to the city council. 
Prior to public service, his volunteer work in-
cluded serving on the Board of Directors of 
the YMCA of San Francisco, as Chairman, 
and on the boards of Broadway by the Bay 
and the Hillsborough Schools Foundation. 
Clearly, Jay Benton is a man who relishes the 
challenge of responsibility. 
His leap into the role of officeholder oc-
curred when he was appointed to the city 
council in 2008 and solidified when he was 
elected in 2010. Since then, he’s served three 
terms and as Mayor from December 2012 to 
December 
2014. 
He’s 
also 
been 
Hillsborough’s member on the Central County

Fire Board, serving as Chairman in 2010 
through 2011. 
Jay joined the council with a willingness to 
learn everything, a determination to probe staff 
reports and to deliver for the residents of 
Hillsborough. I have heard how Jay saved the 
town $1 million on a computer system pur-
chase by challenging the cost. 
Jay became the city’s expert on water 
issues when he was appointed to a local 
agency charged with serving the interests of 
Peninsula cities receiving water from San 
Francisco’s 
Hetch 
Hetchy 
system. 
Hillsborough owns its own water system but is 
reliant on the Hetch Hetchy system for water. 
There have been a few droughts and numer-
ous public policy challenges, including an ex-
pensive capital improvement program, during 
Jay’s tenure. He is described as having a 
‘‘passion’’ for water. He is quick to point out 
opportunities to operate better and always well 
prepared for the agency’s meetings. 
Twice per year, Hillsborough’s civic leader-
ship gathers to compare notes and to coordi-
nate. Present are leaders from public and pri-
vate schools, the town, nonprofits and civic or-
ganizations of various types, and interested 
citizens. The convocation is known as the 
Hillsborough Community Roundtable and its 
purpose is to let everyone know about the 
plans for civic events and government serv-
ices for the next six months. Jay Benton has 
presided over this semi-annual meeting and 
won accolades from all involved because he is 
both a good listener and, not surprisingly, a 
good leader. 
Jay Benton is the devoted husband of Ann 
and they have been married since October 7, 
1967. They have five children: Bill (Susan), 
Tom (Jane), Jim (Mari), Jenny, and Andy 
(Morgan). Jay also has ten grandchildren. On 
December 13, 2020, the day before he steps 
down from the city council, Jay will turn 80 
years old, yet another example of age not 
being a liability in public life. 
Madam Speaker, Jay Benton will leave with 
the city’s finances strong, its capital stock well 
maintained, its spirits high despite the chal-
lenge of the current pandemic, and the future 
of the community well charted for many years 
to come. In Jay, the town has a leader who 
stood the test of time. His neighbors, friends 
and constituents wish Jay, in the hopeful lan-
guage of naval adventurers, fair winds and fol-
lowing seas. It has been my privilege to serve 
with Jay Benton, a great local leader.

HONORING TRENT YACONELLI 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize Trent 
Yaconelli, the Executive Director of St. Helena 
and Calistoga Boys & Girls Club. 
Trent Yaconelli was born in La Mesa, Cali-
fornia, and grew up in Yreka, California. In 
1993, he graduated from Sonoma State Uni-
versity with a Bachelor of Arts in Teacher Edu-
cation. He has also received a Non-Profit 
Management Certification from The University 
of Texas at Austin in 2012. Mr. Yaconelli has 
used his education to aid his community 
through times of hardship, serving as the Ex-
ecutive Director of the Boys & Girls Club since 
2017. Before serving as Executive Director, 
Mr. Yaconelli had served on the Club’s staff 
for more than 20 years and as Associate Ex-
ecutive Director for four and half years. 
Drawing on his years of community service, 
Mr. Yaconelli has shown an immense capacity 
to exercise moral leadership and empathy 
through natural disasters and on-going adver-
sity. He worked with the Club staff to deliver 
more than 25,000 meals to the community, 
day-to-day, during the devastating Glass Fire. 
Recognizing that many of the people who 
were affected by the fire had lost their homes 
and were ineligible to receive disaster relief 
funds, Mr. Yaconelli worked with the Club to 
distribute more than $70,000 in direct gifts to 
fifteen club families. Particularly, he helped 
distribute three cars to families that lost their 
vehicles in the fire, along with an additional 
$15,000 in individual grants to help them get 
back on their feet. 
Trent Yaconelli’s tireless work over these 
past fourteen years should not go unnoticed. 
The support that he has given to the families 
and children of Calistoga and St. Helena has 
undoubtedly improved the livelihood of his 
community. In this spirit, Mr. Yaconelli is cur-
rently serving the students of the St. Helena 
Unified School District while they are partici-
pating in distance learning. His encompassing 
knowledge of his community continues to 
serve the youth and the families that need him 
the most. 
Madam Speaker, Trent Yaconelli exempli-
fies strong integrity and leadership through his 
dedication to public service. It is therefore fit-
ting and proper that we honor him here today.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
TONY LEE 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memory of longtime Seattle resi-
dent Tony Lee, who died on November 12, 
2020. Over his more than 30-year career, 
Tony had a deep and personal impact on our 
community. He leaves behind a tremendous 
legacy of dedicated public service. 
Tony Lee was a kind-hearted friend, activist 
and advocate, and a devoted family member. 
He was humble and wise. Those of us lucky 
enough to have known him will forever re-
member his booming, infectious laugh. 
Tony joined the Seattle community at a 
young age, when he immigrated to the United 
States from China via Brazil with his family. 
He went on to graduate from Harvard and 
earn a law degree from the University of 
Washington. Upon starting his career as a 
lawyer, Tony quickly found his true calling: 
civil rights advocacy. 
Tony began his career as an attorney for 
Evergreen Legal Services, representing the 
needs of indigent clients as well as immigrants 
and refugees. He later served as the Advo-
cacy Director for Solid Ground, where he led 
the anti-poverty, anti-racist organization’s work 
to save cash assistance programs for people 
with disabilities and mental illness, expand 
Medicaid to cover dental care, and overcome 
housing discrimination in Washington State 
over 21 years. He is widely recognized for his 
leadership in creating and maintaining critical 
safety net services for immigrant and refugee 
communities, making Washington State a 
shining example for immigrant inclusion na-
tionwide. 
Tony’s advocacy and activism stretched well 
beyond his formal work positions, putting him 
frequently at the forefront of important efforts 
and movements. Among these, Tony fought 
for rent control, on peace and social justice 
issues and for economic justice. He helped 
found the Statewide Poverty Action Network 
and create the Food Assistance Program, 
which promotes expanding public benefits and 
broadening the safety net for low-income peo-
ple in Washington State. He served as a lead-
er with the Equity in Education Commission, 
the King County Chapter of the Asian Pacific 
Islander Coalition, Seattle Human Services 
Coalition, Church Council of Greater Seattle, 
the Washington Association of Churches, and 
the Catholic Archdiocese. 
Even after his semi-retirement in 2014, Tony 
could still be found advocating in the halls of 
the Washington State Legislature, where he 
was, in the words of Representative Frank 
Chopp, the ‘‘conscience of Washington State.’’ 
I had the pleasure of working with Tony 
over the more than decade I spent organizing 
for immigrant rights, doing lobby days in the 
state capitol, advocating for poor people and 
the most vulnerable and fighting for immi-
grants and refugees, and there was simply no- 
one who knew the subject matter better or 
was more devoted than Tony Lee. 
Tony will be dearly missed, and his tremen-
dous legacy promoting a more just and kind 
Seattle will continue to grow through the com-
munities and lives he touched. He is survived 
by his wife, Angela Bartels; former wife, Shar-
on Lee; his son, Chris; siblings Bernadette, 
Cecilia, Joe, Marie, and Mary; and many 
nieces and nephews. 
For his years of dedicated and compas-
sionate service. I am proud to express my 
deep appreciation for Tony Lee and his advo-
cacy for the most vulnerable members of our 
community. My heart is with his loved ones 
during this difficult time. May he rest in power.

ginia. During his time as my District Director, 
Joe has exemplified the meaning of a ‘‘Serv-
ant Leader’’. From overseeing the district staff

to working with constituents, Joe is always 
thinking about how to make things better and 
what more we can do to make it happen. He 
consistently goes above and beyond to serve 
constituents and support his fellow staff. His 
work as the Academy Coordinator has im-
pacted countless young applicants as they 
begin their careers in service to this nation. 
Joe’s leadership is a shining example of what 
other District Directors should strive to be. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me to recognize Joe Schumacher for 
his selfless dedication to Virginia’s First Dis-
trict. Joe is a crucial member of our team, and 
I am forever grateful for his service to our of-
fice and to Virginia’s First District.

IN HONOR OF MARK OLBERT 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the outstanding service of Mark Olbert 
as he departs the San Carlos City Council 
after nine years as a councilmember, two of 
them as Mayor. Mark also served 10 years on 
the local school board. For a man who moved 
to San Carlos in 1997, he’s spent a remark-
able 19 of those 23 years in local elected of-
fice. 
Mark was raised in Dobbs Ferry, New York 
and obtained his bachelors in cell and molec-
ular biology from the State University of New 
York at Buffalo, and his MBA from the Amos 
Tuck School at Dartmouth College. He went to 
work as a finance executive in the oil and gas 
industry and then transitioned to the world of 
biotechnology. After great success at Amgen, 
Mark moved to San Carlos to grab other brass 
rings in the world of biotechnology. Ultimately, 
he was able to retire early to dedicate his life 
to his family and to public service. 
When he and his wife, Barbara McHugh, 
sought a Bay Area community in which to 
raise their family they selected San Carlos be-
cause of its high-quality schools. Both Mark 
and Barbara plunged into volunteering to raise 
money for the schools and were ultimately 
honored for their leadership by the San Carlos 
Education Foundation. 
In the midst of his career, and while raising 
Arthur and Caroline, the couple’s two children, 
Mark ran for the school board. He succeeded 
in his first effort and was reelected. During his 
10 years as a trustee, he successfully advo-
cated to reform the district’s special education 
program and grappled with the fragile finances 
of the district. For decades, civic leaders had 
opined that, in San Carlos, school parcel taxes 
and bond measures would fail. As a trustee, 
Mark had a different opinion. He and a core 
group led successful efforts to pass several 
tax or bond measures, thereby stabilizing fi-
nances and putting the district on a path to re-
juvenate its schools. 
While on the school board, it was his work 
with the city that sparked his interest in the 
city council. He saw a need for more parks for 
a growing population, more housing, and 
greater transparency in local government. He 
ran for the city council in 2011, came in first, 
and was later re-elected. 
Mark and most of his council colleagues 
tried but were ultimately unable to obtain more 
land to expand city parks. He always main-
tained, however, that the city council had done 
its job by providing residents with a choice 
about their quality of life. 
In recent years, he successfully advocated 
for San Carlos to become a ‘‘welcoming city’’ 
to send a message of hope as immigrants 
came under attack. Homeowners have a 
friend in Mark as the city adopted a proposal 
to help pay for otherwise expensive sidewalk 
repairs. Along with his colleagues, he regularly 
supported thoughtful budgeting that generated 
surpluses. 
Housing is Mark’s constant concern. He 
asks important questions about whether the 
city has zoned enough land for housing in 
order to avoid the displacement of vulnerable 
residents as commercial development acceler-
ates. He is passionate about equal economic 
opportunity and the need to find affordable 
housing for teachers, public safety personnel, 
store clerks, and all others who struggle to 
pay high rents in San Carlos. 
Mark started a blog when he joined the 
school 
board 
and 
continued 
as 
a 
councilmember. Recent council topics on his 
site, ‘‘Making Your Mark,’’ include: ‘‘Reflec-
tions: Paranoia, Tribalism, Politics’’; and, 
‘‘Even in the City of Good Living, Racism is 
Not Patriotism!’’ His retirement may spare the 
public from another blog rumored to be in the 
works: ‘‘Quantum Theory and Time Travel: 
New Adventures in Parenting During A Pan-
demic.’’ His blog’s style is a blend of The New 
York Times Magazine, Scientific American, 
and Mad Magazine. 
Mark Olbert is honest, thoughtful, and dog-
ged in asking questions and getting answers. 
He seeks the long-term welfare of the entire 
community. He is brilliant and has a wonderful 
sense of humor. While ‘‘public servant’’ is a 
title that others may view as pedestrian, he 
treasures it as much as a rare gem. It has 
been my great honor and privilege to serve 
with Mark Olbert. He represents the best in 
public service. I will miss him on the council. 
Let me invoke an amended phrase from a re-
nowned science fiction philosopher, Yoda: 
Mark, May the Force of Public Opinion Always 
Be With You.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PITTMAN- 
ROBERTSON WILDLIFE RESTORA-
TION ACT AND DINGELL-JOHN-
SON SPORT FISH RESTORATION 
ACT 
DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
EQUALITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Pittman-Robertson Wild-
life Restoration Act and Dingell-Johnson Sport 
Fish Restoration Act District of Columbia 
Equality Act, which would amend the Pittman- 
Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the 
Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to 
make the District of Columbia eligible for the 
same federal funding as states under these 
Acts. The District is treated as a state under 
federal programs, with a few exceptions, most 
of them simply oversights or failures to update 
post-home rule. 
The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration 
Act provides funding, derived from excise 
taxes on sporting equipment, for five distinct 
purposes: program administration, wildlife res-
toration, basic hunter education and safety, 
enhanced hunger education and safety grants 
and multistate conservation grants. The Dis-
trict does not receive any funding under this 
Act. The Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restora-
tion Act provides funding for sport fish restora-
tion, aquatic education, wetlands restoration 
and boat-related activities. Under this Act, 
states receive a minimum of one percent of 
the total amount apportioned, while the District 
is capped at one-third of one percent. 
This omission and lack of parity under these 
Acts have serious consequences for the Dis-
trict. The District has roughly 7,800 acres of 
parkland covering nearly a quarter of the city, 
which means it has more parkland per capita 
than any other city in the United States. This 
bill would define ‘‘State’’ in these Acts to in-
clude the District, providing the District with 
equitable access to valuable financial re-
sources for wildlife conservation in our nation’s 
capital. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

ARIZONA VOICE FOR CRIME 
VICTIMS (AVCV)

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, Arizona, a 
national 
leader 
in 
crime 
victims’ 
rights, 
reached a milestone on November 26, 2020— 
30 years since the enactment of the Victims’ 
Bill of Rights (VBR), as art. II § 2.1, of the 
state constitution. The passage of the VBR 
was an immense achievement in the face of 
strong opposition. The movement was led by 
numerous crime victims, grassroots organiza-
tions, and prosecutors throughout the state. 
Prior to this achievement, there had been two 
unsuccessful attempts to get a victims’ rights 
amendment referred by the Arizona Legisla-
ture. Strong opposition came from defense at-
torneys and, astonishingly, judicial officers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1141 
December 14, 2020 
After two attempts to get on the ballot 
through legislative action, in 1990, the people 
of Arizona rallied to support a ballot initiative 
drafted by Steve Twist, then the Chief Assist-
ant Attorney General for Arizona. Petitions 
were circulated and signed by thousands of 
Arizonans who saw and disapproved of the 
grave injustices in how victims were treated 
during the criminal justice process. The effort 
was truly grassroots. Led by the Victims Bill of 
Rights Task Force, victim advocates reached 
out across Arizona. On November 6, 1990, Ar-
izonans voted overwhelmingly to add the new 
VBR to our constitution. In the year following, 
implementing 
statutes 
were 
drafted 
and 
passed in order to further define, preserve, 
and protect the constitutional victims’ rights 
amendment. 
Beyond providing constitutional rights to vic-
tims on paper, Steve Twist and U.S. Senator 
Jon Kyl had a vision for providing victims a 
way to enforce their constitutional rights and 
assure that their voices would be heard during 
the criminal justice process. In 1996, the fu-
ture of non-profit victim services was shaped 
when they founded Arizona Voice for Crime 
Victims (AVCV), the very first clinic of its kind 
to provide both legal and social services to 
crime victims at no cost. The first free legal 
and social services clinic started in 2001, in 
partnership with the Arizona State University 
(ASU) College of Law. 
Since its beginnings, with one lawyer and 
one social worker, AVCV has grown to be one 
of the most successful victims’ rights advocacy 
organizations in the country and serves as a 
model for similar programs around the coun-
try. AVCV’s attorneys, led by Chief Counsel 
Colleen Clase, represent victims of crime, 
without limitation on the type of crime, 
throughout Arizona’s state superior courts, in 
city courts, justice courts, the federal district 
court, appellate courts up to the Supreme 
Court of the United States, and in front of Ari-
zona’s Board of Executive Clemency. AVCV’s 
social services staff provide victims the emo-
tional support needed to get through the crimi-
nal justice process. For nearly 25 years, 
AVCV has contributed significantly to advanc-
ing the enforcement of victim’s rights by seek-
ing appellate remedies. AVCV has litigated 
victims’ rights issues of first impression that 
have resulted in published opinions that de-
fine, implement, preserve and protect victim’s 
constitutional and statutory rights. 
Just this year, AVCV secured an opinion 
from the Arizona Supreme Court that required 
the court to overrule their own precedent, 
three cases predating Arizona’s VBR, and to 
consider another issue of first impression in 
order to honor and uphold the constitutional 
rights of crime victims. In this case, AVCV rep-
resents a child-victim who is the older sibling 
of a 6-year-old murder victim and a witness to 
the severe child abuse and neglect that led to 
his murder. Three of the four family members 
charged in connection with the murder entered 
into guilty pleas, negotiated by the prosecutors 
and criminal defendants, containing a cap on 
the restitution that may be ordered to the 
child-victim. On behalf of the child-victim, 
AVCV objected to the restitution cap. 
On review, the Arizona Supreme Court 
agreed with AVCV and overruled three pre- 
VBR cases that required restitution caps in 
plea agreements, holding that restitution can-
not be capped over the objection of the victim. 
Additionally, as a matter of first impression 
here in Arizona and across the country, the 
Arizona Supreme Court also held that counsel 
for a crime victim should be before the bar 
during proceedings in which victims’ rights are 
at issue. 
AVCV continues to work toward changing 
the culture of the criminal justice system to be 
more inclusive for victims, both in Arizona and 
on the national level, through the filing of ami-
cus briefs and through its work to modernize 
Arizona’s court rules by fully integrating vic-
tims’ rights into Arizona’s Rules of Criminal 
Procedure—another task which has faced 
great opposition from the defense bar and cer-
tain judicial officers. AVCV’s staff regularly 
provides training on victims’ rights topics at 
national conferences including the National 
Crime Victim Law Conference, the annual Na-
tional Organization for Victim Assistance Con-
ference, and the annual Parents of Murdered 
Children National Conference. 
One of AVCV’s most important partnerships 
has been with ASU’s College of Law. This 
partnership is one that is essential to training 
future lawyers by giving law students an op-
portunity to work alongside AVCV’s attorneys 
and social workers to assist and support crime 
victims as they navigate the criminal process. 
The work AVCV has done over the last 25 
years has changed the lives of many crime 
victims who, without the free legal representa-
tion and social services they received, would 
have been left to navigate an arduous justice 
system on their own and without recourse 
when their constitutional rights were violated. 
AVCV has been able to provide thousands of 
victims with a sense of hope through under-
standing and asserting their constitutional 
rights for meaningful participation in our crimi-
nal justice system. AVCV has truly established 
the standard of ‘‘Justice for All—Even the Vic-
tim.’’

HONORING SUPERVISOR SHIRLEE 
ZANE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 14, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague, 
Rep. JARED HUFFMAN, to honor Supervisor 
Shirlee Zane in celebration of her 12 years of 
service on the Sonoma County Board of Su-
pervisors. 
After graduating from Chico State Univer-
sity, Shirlee Zane earned Master’s degrees in 
Theology from Trinity Evangelical Divinity 
School 
and 
in 
Family 
Counseling 
from 
Sonoma State University. She served as a 
minister, social worker, and special education 
professional before being elected to the 
Sonoma County Board of Supervisors in 2008. 
Supervisor Zane has drawn upon over 30 
years of experience in human services to ad-
vocate for increased mental health services in 
the County of Sonoma. She worked tirelessly 
to pass Measure O in Sonoma County, which 
boosts spending on mental health and home-
lessness services, and expands the behavioral 
health mobile support team to assist law en-
forcement on mental health and substance 
abuse calls. Supervisor Zane is also an avid 
supporter of strong environmental policies, 
having served as a director of the Bay Area 
Air Quality Management District and played an 
important role in establishing Sonoma Clean 
Power. 
Perhaps the best testament to Shirlee 
Zane’s dedication to her community is her ex-
emplary work to assist people experiencing 
homelessness by providing them with a place 
to live. She was instrumental in creating Santa 
Rosa’s Veterans Village, which houses four-
teen formerly homeless veterans, and secur-
ing funding for The Palms Inn, which provides 
permanent supportive housing for 130 formerly 
homeless residents. 
Supervisor Zane’s leadership has not gone 
unnoticed, having earned the National Alliance 
on Mental Illness’s California Recovery Practi-
tioner Award, the National Union of Healthcare 
Workers Patient Recovery Award, the Rev-
erend Coffee Human Rights Award and the 
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Community 
Service Award. 
Madam Speaker, Supervisor Shirlee Zane is 
the kind of citizen we should all strive to be. 
Sonoma County is certainly better as a result 
of her dedicated service. It is therefore fitting 
and proper that we honor her here today.
