PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-

Let us pray. 
Most mighty and glorious God, full of 
incomprehensible power and majesty, 
You are all we have. Without Your lu-
minous presence, we will perish. 
Lord, protect the Ukrainian people as 
You would Your very eyes. Hide them 
in the shadow of Your wings from the 
attacks of evil. Empower these lovers 
of freedom to oppose and defeat their

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
HONORING CORPORAL JACOB M. MOORE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
over the weekend, we learned that four 
U.S. marines were tragically killed 
Friday night. Their training aircraft 
crashed during joint NATO exercises in 
Norway. One of those marines, Cor-
poral Moore, was born and raised in 
Catlettsburg, KY. I want to take a mo-
ment to mourn this great loss and sa-
lute Corporal Moore’s service to our 
country. 
Corporal Moore joined the Marines in 
2018. At only 24 years old, he had spent 
4 years honorably serving our country 
all around the world. He was serving as 
an MV–22B Osprey crew chief based out 
of New River, NC. 
Corporal Moore was in Norway along 
with 30,000 other soldiers from 27 coun-
tries for NATO’s Cold Response exer-
cises. Every 2 years, NATO service-
members travel to the edge of the Arc-
tic Circle to train in northern Scan-
dinavia’s frozen wilderness. This long- 
scheduled exercise is not directly re-
lated to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 
but the events of recent weeks have 
only reminded us of the incredible im-
portance of the NATO alliance to 
America’s security and to world peace. 
Corporal Moore’s service was hugely 
and directly important to our Nation, 
to our allies, and to the world. So we 
will never forget Corporal Moore’s 
service and sacrifice in defense of 
America’s safety and freedom. We are 
thinking of and praying for his family 
at this terribly, terribly difficult time. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Madam President, on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, this week, the Senate 
will turn to a crucial constitutional 
duty: deciding whether to provide or 
withhold consent to a lifetime appoint-
ment to the Supreme Court of the 
United States. 
President Biden’s nominee for this 
incredibly consequential position is 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
Judge Jackson is currently a DC Cir-
cuit judge of less than a year. In 9 
months as an appellate judge, she has 
offered only two opinions, both after 
the Supreme Court vacancy opened up. 
So 
this 
time, 
unlike 
Gorsuch, 
Kavanaugh, and Barrett, there is no 
meaningful sample size of appellate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1262 
March 21, 2022 
opinions for Senators to consult. We 
know a lot about the time Judge Jack-
son spent applying precedent as a trial 
judge on the district court but very lit-
tle about her independent views of 
larger constitutional and legal ques-
tions. 
This makes the Judiciary Commit-
tee’s work this week all the more im-
portant. The country needs a respect-
ful, dignified but vigorous and exhaus-
tive hearing. This is especially true in 
light of the curious disconnect between 
the thinness of Judge Jackson’s appel-
late record and the white-hot intensity 
with which our country’s farthest left 
activists wanted her and nobody else 
for this vacancy. 
Fringe 
groups 
that 
attack 
the 
Court’s legitimacy and want Court 
packing spent a great deal of time and 
money promoting Judge Jackson for 
this nomination, and, once nominated, 
prominent, soft-on-crime activists and 
open-borders pressure groups quickly 
rallied to her side. The Senate needs to 
understand why. 
I enjoyed meeting with Judge Jack-
son recently. She is a likeable person. 
More to the point, she has obviously 
reached impressive heights in the legal 
profession. But I voted against con-
firming Judge Jackson to her current 
post last year, and our meeting the 
other week did not resolve my ques-
tions and concerns. 
So here is what I will be especially 
watching and listening for as our col-
leagues question the nominee this 
week. 
First, at the most basic level, I want 
to hear whether Judge Jackson agrees 
that the job of a judge is to follow the 
law as it is written. This is a simple, 
straightforward proposition. But the 
same liberals who have spent decades 
imploring Justices to approach their 
jobs as activist superlegislators are 
now eager to see this nominee con-
firmed. 
Judge Jackson suggested to me in 
our meeting that she does not really 
view herself as having any judicial phi-
losophy whatsoever, but meanwhile, in 
the press, boosters of her nomination 
say she does have a philosophy and 
assures us that it is mainstream. So 
which is it? I hope the committee can 
clear up any confusion. 
It is also the case that President 
Biden has repeatedly declared that any 
judge he appoints will pass certain lit-
mus tests. He said they would have ‘‘an 
expansive view of the Constitution’’ 
that includes the ‘‘penumbras’’ and 
non-textually-based rights that activ-
ist judges favor. The President has 
even made explicit promises about spe-
cific cases. For example, ‘‘They will, in 
fact, support Roe v. Wade.’’ We need to 
know whether Judge Jackson passed 
President Biden’s policy litmus test ex-
plicitly or just implicitly. 
We also need to understand more 
about Judge Jackson’s so-called empa-
thy for particular parties in cases over 
others. This is not an accusation that 
Republicans invented; it is a trait that 
Judge Jackson’s supporters happily as-
cribe to her. One law professor has ex-
plained that Judge Jackson would 
‘‘bring a measure of empathy to the 
criminal defense cases, the Fourth and 
Fifth Amendment cases.’’ 
I guess a judge entering a case with 
special preexisting empathy would be a 
great deal for the party with whom she 
empathizes, but it would certainly be a 
raw deal for the opposite party. A 
judge’s job is to bring neutrality, not 
an agenda. 
And yet, even as America grapples 
with a historic crime wave, the Presi-
dent has chosen a nominee whose own 
supporters say her work as a criminal 
defense lawyer and on the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission will tilt her judg-
ment in favor of convicts. Even as ille-
gal border crossings are setting alltime 
records, political groups that support 
amnesty and functionally open borders 
are cheering that, if confirmed, Judge 
Jackson will ‘‘shape the realities of 
millions’’ of people who have come into 
our country. These confident policy as-
sertions are not selling points; they are 
actually red flags. 
The Supreme Court sits atop one of 
the three pillars of American Govern-
ment. It is the ultimate backstop for 
the endurance of our Constitution and 
the rule of law. And we rightly entrust 
the Justices who lead it with life ten-
ure. So any nominee to this highest 
Bench ought to welcome close scru-
tiny, tough questions, and a rigorous 
review of their record. The country de-
serves nothing less, and this is what 
Senate Republicans will provide this 
week. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
REMEMBERING DON YOUNG 
Mr. SCHUMER. First, Madam Presi-
dent, I want to offer condolences to the 
family of DON YOUNG, the dean of the 
House and longest serving Republican 
in history, who passed away last Fri-
day at the age of 88. 
The State of Alaska has lost a titan, 
the House of Representatives has lost a 
legend, and my thoughts are with his 
family in this difficult time. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Madam President, now on SCOTUS, 
earlier today, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee commenced their hearings 
on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s his-
toric nomination to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
The daughter of public educators, the 
pride of Miami Palmetto Senior High 
School, and a Federal judge for nearly 
a decade, Judge Jackson began her tes-
timony by returning to what matters 
most: her family, her upbringing, her 
qualifications, and, most of all, her fi-
delity to the Constitution. 
Over the course of the week, I expect 
the American people will finally see for 
themselves why Judge Jackson is one 
of the most qualified individuals ever 
to be nominated to the Supreme Court 
of the United States. They will see, for 
instance, why the American Bar Asso-
ciation unanimously rated Judge Jack-
son as ‘‘well qualified’’ for the Supreme 
Court, their highest rating possible. 
They will see why the president of 
the Fraternal Order of Police said 
there is ‘‘little doubt that [Judge Jack-
son] has the temperament, intellect, 
legal experience, and family back-
ground to earn this appointment.’’ 
They will see why even conservative 
judges, like retired DC Circuit Judge 
Thomas Griffith, who introduced Judge 
Jackson today, wrote that ‘‘Judge 
Jackson is immensely qualified to 
serve on the Supreme Court and should 
be confirmed by the Senate.’’ 
And I also trust that Americans will 
see right through the misleading and 
desperate broadsides that a few Mem-
bers of the other side have launched 
against the judge in recent weeks. We 
need not pretend that wild accusations 
from self-interested actors deserve to 
be taken seriously, so color me skep-
tical that the American people will 
give them much weight. 
Finally, as these hearings begin, I 
want to thank Chairman DURBIN for or-
ganizing a speedy and fair confirmation 
process. 
His 
work 
has 
been 
out-
standing. Every member of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee has met with the 
judge, which will allow for thoughtful 
and thorough hearings, just as the 
chairman had promised. 
I, thus, remain confident that as 
these hearings begin, the Senate is on 
track to confirm Judge Jackson as the 
116th Justice of the Supreme Court by 
the end of this work period. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, now on Senate 
business, as the Judiciary Committee 
begins a busy week of hearings, the 
Senate, likewise, begins a busy week 
here on the floor. 
Later this afternoon, the Senate will 
vote to invoke cloture on the motion 
to proceed to the House-passed Amer-
ica COMPETES Act, the next impor-
tant step toward enacting major jobs 
and competitiveness legislation that 
both Republicans and Democrats wide-
ly support. 
Over the past year, the House and 
Senate have acted independently to 
pass their own versions of competitive-
ness legislation. To reconcile the dif-
ferences 
between 
these 
bills, 
both 
Chambers must enter a conference be-
fore we send the final product to the 
President’s desk. 
In order to go to conference, the Sen-
ate needs to amend the House-passed 
COMPETES 
bill 
with 
the 
Senate-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1263 
March 21, 2022 
passed U.S. Innovation and Competi-
tion Act and then send it back to the 
House. That is what we are working to-
ward starting today. 
It is of the highest urgency we move 
forward on competitiveness legislation. 
It will lower costs—the words of the 
day are ‘‘lowering costs stop infla-
tion.’’ This bill will do a lot in that re-
gard. The competitiveness legislation 
will lower costs by bringing manufac-
turing jobs back to America, by fixing 
bottlenecks in our supply chains, and 
by fueling scientific research. 
Importantly, this bill would also help 
ensure that the United States has a 
long-term 
and 
resilient 
supply 
of 
chips—crucial for our military, our 
auto industry, our tech industry, and 
for American families who feel the 
sting through price hikes and mad-
dening delays in available goods. 
As the war in Europe reminds us, our 
country is vulnerable when we import 
too many goods from a single country, 
particularly semiconductors so needed 
in so many sectors of the economy. We 
need to make more of these products 
here in America instead of overseas to 
shore up our supply chains, preserve 
our national security. For that reason 
alone, let’s not tarry any longer. Let’s 
pass this important bill—no more 
delay. 
I want to thank my Republican col-
leagues, especially Senators CORNYN 
and YOUNG, for continuing to work in 
good faith in this process. Most of us 
want to see a conference happen soon, 
and I believe we can reach that goal in 
the coming weeks. 
Now, as important as Judge Jack-
son’s hearings are, I urge everyone not 
to sleep on a handful of other hearings 
happening this week that are crucial 
for our country’s agenda and, frankly, 
our Democratic agenda. 
In the Senate HELP Committee, 
Chairman MURRAY will hold a hearing 
tomorrow on something Democrats 
have pushed for months: cutting the 
cost of childcare and preschool for 
American families. 
The Senate Committee on Aging, 
meanwhile, will hold a hearing this 
Wednesday on increasing home care 
services to seniors, something I strong-
ly support. And I thank Chairman 
CASEY for organizing this hearing. 
And, finally, the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works will also 
meet Wednesday for a hearing on clean 
energy, combating climate change, and 
increasing America’s energy independ-
ence in the 21st century. 
All these issues—fighting climate 
change, lowering the costs of childcare, 
taking care of our seniors—remain at 
the top of our caucus’s priorities. 
These hearings will inform us im-
mensely as our caucus continues work-
ing on legislation that will lower costs 
and expand opportunity for the Amer-
ican people. 
RUSSIA 
Madam President, finally on PNTR, 
last week, the House acted in near- 
unanimous fashion to pass legislation 
revoking Permanent Normal Trade Re-
lations with Russia. 
This legislation is very much needed 
for fighting Russia and holding Putin 
accountable for the carnage—the des-
picable, nasty, devilish carnage—he has 
waged, he has levied upon the Ukrain-
ian people. This bill is one way to 
make sure he continues to pay a heavy 
price for starting this bloody and sav-
age war. 
We need this legislation passed with-
out delay. It got overwhelming support 
from Republicans in the House, includ-
ing from Leader MCCARTHY. There is 
no reason to hold it up. Let’s move it 
forward. Let’s move it forward. 
No nation has so thoroughly soaked 
the blood of innocent civilians as Rus-
sia. No nation like that deserves to 
have any kind of normal trade rela-
tions with the United States. 
I call on my Republican colleagues to 
work with us to pass this legislation 
quickly. There is no reason—absolutely 
no reason—to delay its passage. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
USICA 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to talk about supply 
chain issues because we all know that 
supply chain issues are plaguing us on 
a variety of fronts, and Congress needs 
to act to help consumers, to help our 
industries, and to make sure that sup-
ply chains work very well. 
I want to start by thanking the Biden 
administration for their fast action, 
along 
with 
Agricultural 
Secretary 
Vilsack, for creating popup space at 
our ports to make sure that U.S. grow-
ers and shippers can get their products 
to market. 
We have seen exorbitant rates now 
charged in shipping; that is, rates that 
used to be $1,300 a container have now 
gone up to either $5,000 a container or 
$11,000 a container, just depending on 
where you are talking about products 
being shipped. So agricultural products 
are being left on the docks because 
ships are actually returning empty and 
not taking our products with them. 
Tomorrow, we will try to address this 
issue in the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee, but for now, as I said, last Fri-
day, the administration announced a 
very innovative plan to make sure that 
there was dock space at U.S. ports to 
make sure that U.S. shipments—agri-
culture specifically—can be waiting 
and ready on the docks and get out the 
door. This is so important because 
there were industry officials there from 
the lentil association, from the dairy 
association—they said they had lost 
billions last year from the impact of 
not being able to get their products to 
market. 
We know for a fact that there were 24 
percent fewer containers that left full 
last year, and some people say that 
number has risen to 30 percent this 
year. So it means that instead of being 
filled with our U.S. exports to Asia, 
these containers are being left empty, 
and they are hurrying back to be filled 
up with more imports and then running 
back here to the United States. 
We can’t allow this cost to impact 
our growers. Not only does it impact 
them in not getting the product to 
market, but what happens is, they ac-
tually lose shelf space. No one is going 
to wait forever for the U.S. product to 
come; they will just go to another 
country and give them the shelf space. 
So the Biden administration is taking 
quick action to create this space at our 
ports to make sure that U.S. products 
are well positioned to get back to these 
markets as quickly as possible. 
Congestion has been part of the prob-
lem. We have seen a huge increase in 
imports coming into the United States. 
That has caused uncertainty and con-
gestion at these ports, and we need to 
do—that is why many of us supported 
the infrastructure bill, to also build 
more capacity at our ports. 
We know that we are going to con-
tinue to do everything we can in this 
area of shipping reform to make sure 
that U.S. farm agricultural products 
get to their destination in a timely 
fashion. 
I will have more to say about that to-
morrow 
after 
we 
get 
legislation 
through our committee, but today, I 
really wanted to speak to our col-
leagues and ask them to support mov-
ing forward on going to conference on 
the United States Innovation and Com-
petition Act. 
It has been 286 days since the U.S. 
Senate passed this legislation, and we 
have an opportunity to help establish 
on a continued basis American leader-
ship in technology, to employ more 
people, to help our country compete in 
the economy of the future. But we 
can’t do that if we don’t get legislation 
passed, and we can’t continue to wait 
for people who don’t want to go to con-
ference. Our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have to help us get to 
conference. 
This is so important because by 2030, 
there could be more than 10 million 
new jobs in clean energy, advanced 
manufacturing, communication, and in 
computing. All of those—guess what— 
depend on us making sure we do the 
right amount of R&D and making sure 
that we help bring U.S. manufacturing 
back to the United States. 
This is so critical as Americans are 
feeling the pinch from products that 
they can’t get. We all know that we 
have to help small manufacturers who 
struggle with the supply chain them-
selves. That is why this bill invests in 
the National Institute for Technology 
to help companies strengthen their 
supply chain and fend off the threats of

cyber security attacks. We also know 
that there is money in here to help 
educate a STEM workforce so that we 
can train and skill the number of peo-
ple in STEM jobs that we need. But 
let’s talk specifically about one supply 
chain crisis that is crippling America’s 
economy right now because we don’t 
have enough semiconductors. 
Semiconductors are an integral part 
of our system in communication, in de-
fense, in healthcare, in transportation. 
Yet there are zero semiconductor fab-
rication facilities in the United States 
that produce the most advanced chips. 
That is what we are after—the most 
advanced chips. 
The United States must keep its 
leadership in this area of advanced 
technology. In fact, over 90 percent of 
these chips are manufactured in the 
Pacific, in Taiwan. The rest are made 
in South Korea. So this is an economic 
and national security issue. Chip short-
ages drive up costs, and they also make 
us less safe. 
We know, thanks to a report from 
the Senate Armed Services Committee 
10 years ago, that more than 1 million 
counterfeit 
components 
have 
been 
made and made their way into our na-
tional security system. So we have 
been fighting hard to fix that problem. 
Just this month, Europol reported 
that counterfeiters are trying to ex-
ploit the semiconductor shortage by in-
troducing fake chips into the market, 
raising the chances that critical infra-
structure like our defense system or 
other kinds of communication systems 
could be compromised. 
We have also been working hard to 
‘‘rip and replace’’—a term that has 
been used—to try to get foreign tele-
communication electronics that could 
be compromised and used as a backdoor 
to try to make sure that we lower this 
threat. 
According 
to 
the 
telecommuni-
cations industry, this effort is com-
promised by what? Our chip shortage, 
which now we know that waiting times 
for some network equipment is now at 
50 weeks—50 weeks for something that 
is so important to our national secu-
rity. 
The cost of some networking equip-
ment has risen by as much as 12 per-
cent. You hear about the cost of every-
thing. We certainly hear about the cost 
of cars. So 12 percent, and people are 
selling chips for 100 times their regular 
price. That is no way to help us build 
out secure broadband access. 
When it comes to clean energy, which 
requires chips, the prices of solar pan-
els are up 18 percent because of the 
chip shortage. The cost of a used car 
has gone up 41 percent and 12 percent 
for new cars. 
So a lot is due to this semiconductor 
shortage. Yet our colleagues don’t 
know if we want to hurry after 286 
days, go to conference, and fix this 
problem. I am asking my colleagues to 
vote to help us proceed to conference. 
Let’s not take another 31⁄2, 4 weeks to 
figure it out. If you don’t like the 
House bill—I know a lot of my col-
leagues don’t—let’s get a better bill, 
but let’s go to conference to get that 
done. 
We know right now depending on one 
country largely for chip fabrication is 
not the best idea, particularly when 
there are numerous issues. It has just 
been over 18 months since security re-
searchers found a hacking campaign 
that compromised at least seven Tai-
wanese chip manufacturers to steal 
semiconductor chip designs. 
So do we want to continue to rely on 
these other countries or do we want to 
manufacture here in the United States 
of America something so critical to 
what is critical to the industries of the 
future and help us by making sure that 
we have a plan never to have these 
kinds of price spikes impact us because 
of shortages? 
So I ask my colleagues this. These 
R&D bills are going to help us with 
U.S. manufacturing. They are so im-
portant. In addition to the semicon-
ductor manufacturing incentives that 
are in these bills, it specifically has re-
sources for the Department of Defense 
to 
secure 
microelectronic 
supply 
chains and help our national security 
mission. That is what is at stake here. 
Why are we delaying? If you don’t like 
these ideas, at least let’s get on the bill 
and offer some ideas in conference that 
you would like to see. We are more 
than happy to have that discussion. 
Industry is taking action to try to re-
solve the shortages, but investing in 
semiconductor 
manufacturing 
tech-
nology will actually help us increase 
the productivity that is so essential 
and needed for our foundries. 
Our current shortages—some people 
might think: Well, in a few years, we 
will catch up, and it will be a thing of 
the past. 
I will tell you, if we don’t act, more 
shortages are to follow. The world 
needed 1 trillion chips per year by 2018. 
In 2021, it was nearly 1.2 trillion chips 
per year. That is how our economy has 
changed, and everything relies on these 
semiconductors. In 2031, if total sales 
match the revenue projection, we will 
need 2 trillion chips per year. That is 
why we need to act quickly on some-
thing that is impacting, practically 
every day, parts of our lives. Current 
projections show that demand for chips 
will grow in all sectors—especially the 
automotive 
sector, 
where 
semicon-
ductor content in vehicles could dou-
ble. 
Now, I don’t know—I heard a lot of 
talk as I went home to hear about 
these issues. Some people are saying 
that maybe people are even taking 
semiconductors out of the current de-
signs of automobiles just so they can 
get the product ready, so they can get 
it to ship. Now, why do we want that? 
We don’t want that. We want America 
to have a full supply of semiconduc-
tors, produce the best intelligent prod-
uct that the market wants, and com-
pete internationally. But to do that, 
we have to get this bill moving, and we 
have to get support. 
That is why on Wednesday we are 
having members of the semiconductor 
industry testify before the Senate 
Commerce Committee—so we can hear 
about how the United States can have 
next-generation technology and lead in 
this critical area. We do not want to 
rely on someone else to make sure that 
we have a secure nation, secure com-
munication, and the next generation 
that is going to move our industry— 
particularly 
manufacturers—to 
be 
competitive in a global economy. 
So the choice in front of us is wheth-
er we want the United States to have a 
leading role in chip fabrication and in 
R&D and whether we are going to meet 
that demand. If you are ready to take 
that, please help us get to conference. 
It can take 3 to 5 years from when a 
foundry is built to when production be-
gins, and every day that we don’t move 
to pass USICA is just another day that 
U.S. manufacturers are waiting. 
This bill means investment in our fu-
ture, it means investment in securing 
the supply chain, and it means invest-
ments that will protect us from these 
kinds of price spikes in the future. It is 
an investment well worth meeting if 
Congress will act, and I encourage my 
colleagues to do so. 
I thank the President, and I yield the 
floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nomination: Nani 
A. Coloretti, of California, to be Dep-
uty Director of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget; that the Senate vote 
on the nomination without intervening 
action or debate; that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate; that any statements re-
lated to the nomination be printed in 
the RECORD; and that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
any objection? 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Proceed. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I do 
object to this nomination moving at 
this point to be able to do a unanimous 
consent on this. The reason for that is, 
at OMB, we have consistently gone 
back to them and asked for just basic 
information, and OMB continues to be 
the spot where things are held up, and 
they are not turning the information 
over to us. 
We have been exceptionally patient 
with OMB. Let me give you a couple of 
examples on this. 
We worked with DHS to try to get 
some additional information on some 
of the detention beds and to be able to 
ask about this. We submitted specific 
questions for the record to DHS in July 
of last year and then again in Novem-
ber of last year. We still do not have 
the answers to those. 
It is our understanding DHS has 
turned those over to OMB to be able to 
evaluate. OMB still is not turning 
those over to anyone else so they are 
locked up into the system. 
I have had numerous conversations 
with OMB and with the White House on 
trying to get the information on how 
they are handling religious exemptions 
and religious accommodations for the 
vaccine mandates. This is an entirely 
new process that they have created for 
all of the Agencies and an entirely dif-
ferent process that is running through 
the U.S. military right now. 
There are around 23,000 people who 
have made a request in the military for 
religious accommodation, about 23 of 
them have actually been given an an-
swer. Most of them are just getting no 
answer. Across the Federal Agencies 
and all the Federal families, they are 
asking the questions about what do we 
do on a religious accommodation. They 
are just not getting an answer at all or 
they are getting answers that are dif-
ferent. 
We have asked OMB specifically for 
the information, just how are you han-
dling it? How are decisions being made? 
What is the timing on it? We are not 
getting answers on that. 
We have gone to the task force. We 
have gone to OMB. We have gone to the 
White House. We have gone to Agen-
cies. They all point back to OMB, say-
ing they are the ones that are going to 
actually release that. We are not get-
ting it, basic clarity of information. 
I can go on and on and on. I have got 
pages of questions that we put in that 
we are either not getting an answer at 
all or they have released to us some-
thing that is publicly available but not 
the actual information on it. We are 
not asking for unreasonable things. We 
are just asking for an answer. 
So, yes, I do object, but I would real-
ly like to be able to get this informa-
tion from OMB. 
If this was a nominee on the other 
side, Democrats would certainly be 
asking for information and saying: 
Why did we make a request in July and 
it is now March and we can’t get an an-
swer because OMB won’t release the 
answer that has been submitted by the 
Agency? So I do object. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, it 
makes no sense to say that we are not 
getting answers so we are not going to 
confirm anybody to this position of 
Deputy Director of OMB. We only just 
confirmed the Director last week. 
It is like saying: I am going to the 
emergency room because I have an 
emergency, and there are no doctors 
working there to solve my problem so 
we are not going to let any more doc-
tors in to work there. It makes no 
sense. 
I am deeply disappointed the Repub-
licans are objecting to the swift con-
firmation 
of 
the 
Honorable 
Nani 
Coloretti to be Deputy Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget. 
She came through committee; she 
was reported out of committee; and if 
there were any questions of her, they 
should have been asked in committee. 
But, again, we are holding up the 
nomination of someone to lead an 
Agency that you are complaining isn’t 
answering your questions. Well, there 
is no leadership there to make sure 
that those questions get answered. So 
this is a circular logic that does not 
make any sense. 
In fact, Ms. Coloretti is eminently 
qualified to hold this position of Dep-
uty Director of OMB. Like many mem-
bers of our Nation’s diverse Asian- 
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pa-
cific 
Islander 
community, 
Ms. 
Coloretti and her family lived the 
American dream of countless immi-
grants who came to the Nation in 
search of a better life. Her late parents 
instilled in her the value of education 
and hard work and, perhaps more im-
portantly, fostered a sense of empathy 
and curiosity that helped lead Ms. 
Coloretti to choose a life of public serv-
ice. And make no mistake, she is a true 
public servant who is devoted to serv-
ing her country. 
Her nomination should not be con-
troversial. After all, a bipartisan super-
majority coalition of Senators already 
confirmed her to serve as Deputy Sec-
retary of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment. Of course, this overwhelming 
support was not surprising, given Ms. 
Coloretti’s impressive experience in 
the public and private sectors, includ-
ing serving as a program examiner at 
OMB. 
During her time in public service, 
Ms. Coloretti dedicated herself to mak-
ing government work better for the 
people it serves. At the U.S. Depart-
ment of Treasury, she pushed to en-
hance 
decision-making 
processes 
through better use of data and evi-
dence. 
At the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, where she 
served as a Chief Operating Officer of a 
Department with a $45 billion budget 
and approximately 8,000 employees, Ms.

Coloretti 
focused 
on 
strengthening 
management practices to improve pro-
gram delivery and ultimately achieve 
better results. 
Look, there is no question that Nani 
Coloretti is eminently qualified to be 
Deputy Director of the OMB, nor is 
there any question that the President 
deserves to have his full leadership 
slate in place to formulate and finalize 
his fiscal year 2023 budget proposal. 
As the President often notes, a budg-
et truly reveals what one values, and 
that is why it was so important that 
the Senate confirmed the Honorable 
Shalanda Young to be OMB Director 
last week. 
Now, my question is, If you want to 
fix the problem and get answers, let’s 
get somebody like Nani Coloretti in 
there who has got a background and a 
track record of getting Departments 
and Agencies working correctly, work-
ing again efficiently for the American 
people. That is why it is critical that 
we move swiftly to confirm Nani 
Coloretti now. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
come to the Senate floor today to 
stand in solidarity with the people of 
Ukraine as they suffer through the bru-
tal and cowardly Russian assault. 
I have spoken on the floor each of the 
last 6 weeks about the horrific events 
we have all watched unfold and what 
role the United States should play. 
Simply put, we need to do more, and 
we need to do it more quickly, as do 
our allies. 
As we talk this evening, the shelling 
and killing of innocent civilians con-
tinues in the dark of night in places 
like Kyiv and Kharkiv and Mariupol, a 
beautiful port city being reduced to 
rubble by a frustrated Vladimir Putin. 
He seems intent on destroying what he 
can’t 
have 
because 
of 
the 
brave, 
outgunned Ukrainians, who refuse to 
surrender and refuse to live under his 
despotic rule. 
Those heroic Ukrainian defenders of 
their homeland deserve our support. 
Even if they didn’t, this bloody war 
launched by an authoritarian regime 
against a peaceful, democratic neigh-
bor matters to world freedom, to our 
own national security. It must not 
stand, or else all of us in freedom-lov-
ing countries are at risk. 
As we talk this evening, the ruthless 
bombing continues. Something else is 
happening. President Biden is getting 
ready to cross the Atlantic to meet 
with our NATO partners to talk about 
next steps. Although nothing has done 
more to solidify the West than the 
ruthless Russian attacks, I commend 
President Biden for the important role 
he has played in helping keep the alli-
ance together. Now, I call on him to 
lead that alliance to redouble their ef-
forts to stop the madness, to ensure 
that Russia is not rewarded for its war 
crimes. It is one thing to keep the alli-
ance together; it is another to lead the 
alliance out of its comfort zone to a 
more aggressive stance to actually win 
this war. 
I believe moving leaders to do more 
is possible because of all the deadly 
Russian escalation that we have seen 
but also because free citizens all 
around the world are shocked by the 
death and destruction that they see on-
line and on TV every day, and they are 
speaking up. I see this at home in Ohio, 
but I see it all around the globe. 
I think leaders can be persuaded to 
do more. Over the past month, the ad-
ministration itself has changed its 
mind and ratcheted up some sanctions 
and military assistance that we have 
advocated from both sides of the aisle 
from this Senate floor. To their credit, 
the 
administration 
reversed 
them-
selves and agreed to implement the 
Nord Stream 2 sanctions, to allow U.S. 
Stinger missiles to go to Ukraine di-
rectly from us, to impose the SWIFT 
banking sanctions, to ban oil from Rus-
sia, and to take away Russia’s most fa-
vored nation trading status with us. 
Now, with Russia ramping up its bru-
tal assault, targeting and killing thou-
sands of innocent civilians, America 
and the free world must do more—as 
they bomb maternity hospitals and 
schools and a shopping center in Kyiv 
last night and bomb shelters filled with 
children. 
Last week, I led a bipartisan group of 
Senators to Poland and to the Ukrain-
ian border, where we witnessed first-
hand the pain that Russia is inflicting 
on innocent civilians. We talked to 
dozens 
of 
refugees—almost 
always 
Ukrainian women and children, some-
times grandmothers and grandchildren. 
They came to Poland with only a back-
pack or a suitcase and nothing else, 
leaving everything else behind. In 
tears, they begged us to close the skies 
so the bombing would stop. They told 
of apartments or homes being de-
stroyed, of the heartbreak of leaving 
their husbands or sons or fathers be-
hind to fight the invaders. 
So what more can we and our allies 
do to help Ukraine win this war? Note, 
I say ‘‘win this war.’’ If we act swiftly, 
I think we can still defeat the Russians 
and keep Ukraine as a viable democ-
racy. If we do too little, thousands will 
die, as will the dream of Ukrainian de-
mocracy. The forces of evil will win, 
and all of us will pay a price. 
Let me talk about five areas where I 
think we could do more to assist 
Ukraine. First, on the military side, we 
must redouble our efforts with urgency 
to provide Ukraine with the equipment 
and munitions and, where necessary, 
the immediate training to improve 
their air defenses and give them better 
offensive air capabilities. 
The decision whether to facilitate 
providing more MiG–29s from Poland 
and perhaps other allies in the region 
who have these Soviet-era airplanes 
has been hotly debated. In my view, we 
should have done it a long time ago, 
when we got the initial green light 
from the administration a few weeks 
ago. 
The Ukrainians have asked for them, 
and I do not believe they are any more 
escalatory than, certainly, the esca-
lation that Russians are engaged in 
virtually every day. We now have re-
ports of cluster bombs being used. We 
have reports of vacuum bombs being 
used against civilians. It is also no dif-
ferent than what we have done and 
continue to do with other weapon 
transfers, whether it is Stingers or 
Javelins or others. 
Remember, the Ukrainians are on de-
fense here. They are just trying to pro-
tect their country. Give them what 
they say they need to defend them-
selves. I would hope that at least we 
could 
immediately 
facilitate 
spare 
parts and other assistance to keep the 
current Ukrainian planes flying. 
The Ukrainians have made it des-
perately clear that they need more air 
defense. We just learned today from 
public sources that the United States 
is providing SA8s, an older Soviet-era 
defense system, to Ukraine. Appar-
ently, this is equipment that we got 
years ago—because it was the Soviet 
system—to be able to study it. We now 
have that system, and as of today, we 
have decided to send it to Ukraine. 
However, the same reporting also said 
that the more capable S–300 Soviet-era 
systems that we have are not being 
sent. 
Look, I am very glad these systems 
are going to protect innocent civilians, 
but, to me, this shows the lack of ur-
gency that I was talking about earlier. 
Here we are on day 25 of this all-out 
war—people dying every single day— 
and, finally, we have looked into the 
closet, and we have in the inventory 
these incredibly important air defense 
systems, and we are providing them? 
Where were they on day 5 or day 10 or 
day 15 or even day 20, with people 
dying every one of those 25 days? 
And why are we not sending the 
A300s? I don’t know the answer to that. 
There may be an answer. There may be 
a reason I can’t know what that answer 
is. But again, to me, this is an example 
of us having to have the urgency to re-
spond and doing more and doing it 
more quickly. 
The United States can and should fa-
cilitate the transfer of former Warsaw 
bloc anti-aircraft systems that Ukrain-
ians know how to operate, like the S– 
300, like the SA8s, the SA10s, and oth-
ers. There are regional partners in the 
area, Eastern European countries, that 
have these systems, without going into 
detail. 
We should also provide extra muni-
tions to replenish existing anti-air bat-
teries. Our partners in the region say 
they are willing. Let’s facilitate. Let’s

make it happen. Let’s get the NATO 
countries that can help to help more. 
Over the weekend, there were re-
ports, as an example, that Slovakia 
and Turkey were willing to take such 
action. We have got to be sure that we 
are ensuring these transfers take place 
immediately. Of course, we must also 
keep sending Stinger missiles, which 
are effective in shooting down Russian 
helicopters and the lower-flying jets. 
We must find ways to quickly provide 
Ukraine with more armed drones, such 
as the Turkish TB2, which has been 
very effective, apparently, and even 
one-use loitering munitions, which the 
Ukrainians know how to use and have 
been very effective with on the battle-
field. 
Last week, it was announced that the 
United States was sending 100 of these 
loitering 
munitions, 
one-use 
muni-
tions, called the Switchblade. One hun-
dred will go very quickly. We should 
increase that number. Let’s get the 
hundred there first, and let’s increase 
that number to give the Ukrainians 
more to be able to defend themselves. 
To our Israeli friends—I know this is 
controversial—but I would ask them to 
consider selling us or other countries— 
and we should agree to buy—their 
Harop drones, which Ukraine could use 
right now. The bottom line is we need 
to flood the zone when it comes to pro-
viding Ukraine with military assist-
ance. 
We are not being asked to fight this 
fight for them. They just want the 
tools to be able to defend themselves 
and have a chance—a fighting chance— 
to be able to win. There should be no 
gaps in our weapon transfers, and we 
need to lead our NATO allies and oth-
ers when it comes to providing and co-
ordinating support. 
Second, we need more sanctions. We 
need to implement them faster. The 
sanctions have to bite now, not 2 weeks 
from now or 2 months from now. We 
need to remove all Russian banks’ ac-
cess to the global financial system. 
Russia must be financially cut off from 
the rest of the world if we are to have 
the effect that we want to have. Even 
without using our full sanctions au-
thority, we have already seen some of 
the pain that we can inflict. 
However, there are loopholes in these 
sanctions. It is not enough to go after 
individual banks, such as VTB and 
Sberbank. We are told that the Krem-
lin has already transitioned payments 
from these banks through Rosbank, 
UniCredit, and Raiffeisen. We need 
blocking sanctions on all of Russia’s fi-
nance and defense industry as long as 
Russian forces are in Ukraine. 
We need to exert maximum pressure 
to ensure no money can be sent to Rus-
sia to fund its war effort. We must im-
plement full blocking sanctions on all 
Russian 
banks 
and 
ensure 
energy 
transactions are not exempt from these 
transactions. Russia should not be al-
lowed to use its oil and gas profits to 
kill innocent Ukrainians. 
We can also target the way Russia, 
including individuals close to Presi-
dent Putin, currently evade sanctions. 
In 2020, when I was chair of the Perma-
nent Subcommittee on Investigations, 
we published a bipartisan report show-
ing how sanctioned oligarchs continued 
to have access to the U.S. financial 
system, in this case, through the pur-
chase of high-value art. The two 
oligarchs we investigated were sanc-
tioned in 2014 following Russia’s inva-
sion of Crimea. 
You have heard that those sanctions 
weren’t particularly effective. This is 
one 
reason. 
They 
laundered 
their 
money through art. They continued to 
purchase millions in art through auc-
tion houses and dealers in New York 
after they were sanctioned. 
In that report, we recommended Con-
gress should amend the Bank Secrecy 
Act to require art dealers to confirm 
the identity of buyers and sellers in 
transactions to ensure they are not 
using the art purchases to launder 
money or evade sanctions. These are 
the same requirements we place on fi-
nancial institutions. Those changes are 
now more urgently needed than ever. 
The European Union and the United 
Kingdom recently closed this loophole 
by requiring businesses handling art 
transactions valued at 10,000 pounds or 
more to comply with anti-money laun-
dering laws, including verifying the 
identity of the seller, buyer, and ulti-
mate beneficial owner of the art so 
that the purchase isn’t being used to 
evade sanctions. 
Since the EU and UK have tightened 
compliance, the United States, which 
has the largest art market in the 
world, becomes now the main target 
for sanctioned Russians to continue to 
evade sanctions and launder money 
through high-value art purchases. If 
the administration doesn’t move on 
this, we are currently drafting legisla-
tion to close this loophole in the U.S. 
Senate. 
Third, on tax treatment, we should 
suspend our tax treaty with Moscow 
and explore options to remove other 
tax benefits from Russian businesses. 
The United States has income tax trea-
ties with a number of foreign countries 
to facilitate investment and prevent 
double taxation of residents and busi-
nesses which operate in both countries. 
Under these tax treaties, residents, not 
necessarily citizens, of foreign coun-
tries are generally taxed at a reduced 
rate or exempt on certain items of in-
come. It is important to note that 
these treaties reduce U.S. taxes on 
Russian residents and businesses, but 
they generally don’t reduce the taxes 
of U.S. citizens or U.S. treaty resi-
dents. Instead, they would reduce Rus-
sian taxes for U.S. citizens. 
President Biden has the constitu-
tional authority to suspend our tax 
treaty between the United States and 
the Russian Federation. We need to 
pursue all options to isolate Russia and 
make it clear that there are con-
sequences for their actions. The tax 
treaty is one more way to do that. 
We should also follow the UK and 
suspend the exchange and sharing of 
tax 
information 
with 
Russia 
and 
Belarus. With Russia’s hostile actions 
toward Ukraine, we should no longer 
incentivize U.S. investment in Russia 
or provide preferential tax treatment 
for Russian investment in the United 
States. 
Fourth, on trade, there are two addi-
tional things we can do to bring pres-
sure on President Putin and his allies. 
Access to our market is a privilege, not 
a right, and we should not give Russia 
the normal access. The House passed a 
law to suspend what is called ‘‘most fa-
vored nation,’’ or PNTR, for Russia 
last week, which some in the Senate 
oppose because it does not contain a 
statutory ban on Russian energy im-
ports. Currently, the energy import 
ban can be undone at the whim of a 
President, rather than the legislative 
criteria 
about 
the 
restoration 
of 
Ukrainian sovereignty and the ces-
sation of hostilities. So I agree with 
putting it in statute. I think that 
would be a good idea. But I also believe 
the urgency of the moment means that 
we have to find a way to stop preferred 
access to our market. Let’s do it this 
week. 
The International Trade Commission 
should also bring the full might of U.S. 
trade remedy law to bear on Russian 
companies which trade unfairly, simi-
lar to how we treat Chinese companies. 
Last week, I sent a bipartisan letter 
with Senator BROWN to the ITC on this 
topic. The Commission is required by 
law to consider ‘‘all relevant economic 
factors which have a bearing on the 
state of the industry in the United 
States.’’ Given Russia’s behavior, in-
cluding its manipulation of trade flows 
in pursuit of malign strategic objec-
tives and exceptional involvement of 
the state in the domestic economy, we 
ask the Commission to take these into 
account in cases involving Russia when 
they violate our trade laws. 
The Commerce Department should 
reclassify Russia as a nonmarket econ-
omy, making it easier to bring unfair 
trade cases against them. It is appro-
priate to reclassify them because up to 
77 percent of their economy is now run 
by the government. Commerce was 
asked to reclassify in the fall but re-
tained Russia as a market economy, al-
legedly after a Russian delegation pres-
sured the Biden administration. In 
light of the invasion, Commerce should 
reconsider that decision and ensure 
that Russia is reclassified as a non-
market economy. 
Now a handful of countries, like 
China and Belarus, are in that cat-
egory. This means these countries 
don’t have a free market. Instead, they 
have policies that restrict the flow of 
capital, involve government in the run-
ning of the economy, and don’t allow 
wages to be set by free bargaining be-
tween labor and management. When a 
country is a nonmarket economy, it 
means our trade enforcers have an easi-
er time of being tougher on those coun-
tries when they sell products here that 
are unfairly priced. It is time to do it.

Fifth, and maybe most important 
and most difficult, we need to lead our 
European allies on fully sanctioning 
Russia’s energy sector. Russia’s war 
machine is funded primarily through 
energy sales, including natural gas and 
oil to Europe. Probably the best way to 
persuade those persuadable in Russia is 
to cut off those resources, as we are 
doing here in the United States. It is 
going to be a lot more difficult for our 
allies in Europe to do that because 
many are dependent on Russian en-
ergy. But there are many steps the 
United States and other allies, like 
Qatar, can take to expand energy pro-
duction here at home and help our al-
lies abroad. LNG export contracts need 
to be finalized now and the export and 
import terminals quickly expanded. 
And that can be done. 
Further, the Treasury Department’s 
announcement that sanctions against 
Russia’s biggest banks, including VTB 
Bank, do not apply to energy trans-
actions until June 24—June 24 may be 
too late. That is unacceptable. We need 
to change that Treasury Department 
approach to sanctions against those 
biggest banks and ensure that we are 
applying them to energy transactions 
as soon as possible. 
I would advocate for a similar ap-
proach in how we designated Iranian 
entities in 2018 when we left JCPOA. 
We did not issue sanctions waivers to 
European companies that continued to 
do business with Iran’s economy, and 
that forced those companies to leave 
Iran’s market, even though European 
governments weren’t particularly sup-
portive of that. That is what happened. 
Some countries in Europe have not 
done enough to diversify their energy 
future in light of this invasion, which 
they are now financing, again, through 
the purchase of Russian gas. It can’t be 
business as usual. We need to figure 
out a way to stop that revenue. 
By the way, there is a connection be-
tween the Iran deal and Ukraine. Under 
the new Iran deal, secondary sanctions 
will be lifted on the Central Bank of 
Iran and all other Iranian financial in-
stitutions, enabling transactions be-
tween Russia and Iran, to include the 
Central Bank of Russia, Sberbank, and 
others. In other words, the Iran nuclear 
deal guarantees that Russia can use a 
sanctions-free Iran as a sanctions-eva-
sion oasis. This should not stand. 
The administration needs to reverse 
course here. Sanctioning Russia be-
cause of the barbaric war in Ukraine 
and then giving them a pass when it 
comes to the Iran nuclear deal is con-
tradictory to our foreign policy inter-
ests. At the very least, this proposed 
treaty needs to be submitted to Con-
gress as is required by law so that we 
can analyze that issue and make a de-
cision. 
We need to do more, and we need to 
do it quickly. I have outlined some of 
the actions we can take, and we should 
act fast to let the people of Ukraine 
know we stand with them. The popular 
Ukrainian 
rallying 
cry 
‘‘Slava 
Ukraini,’’ 
when 
translated 
into 
English, is ‘‘Glory to Ukraine.’’ ‘‘Slava 
Ukraini,’’ to which the response is 
‘‘Glory to the Heroes,’’ ‘‘Heroyam 
Slava.’’ 
In the midst of this atrocity, there 
are so many heroes to glorify in 
Ukraine: the soldiers, professionals, 
and civilians, alike, doctors and nurses 
and firefighters and the volunteers who 
are providing food and water and blan-
kets. We pray for them all. We pray for 
their families. 
Godspeed to the people of Ukraine in 
their simple and profound quest, a bat-
tle for a free and independent Ukraine. 
We must show the world that America 
supports that simple quest, that we 
stand with Ukraine. 
I yield the floor.

MORNING BUSINESS 
REMEMBERING GARRY J. 
AUGUSTINE 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the life and service of a 
decorated veteran, fierce advocate, and 
great man, Garry Augustine. 
As the executive director of the Dis-
abled American Veterans, DAV, from 
2013 to 2018 and a 50-year life member, 
Garry helped shape the legislative 
landscape for disabled veterans and 
their families nationwide by advo-
cating before Congress, the White 
House, and Department of Veterans Af-
fairs. 
While Garry is no longer with us, his 
legacy lives on. On behalf of myself, 
Congress and my fellow Americans, I 
would like to extend our deepest grati-
tude for his life and service to this Na-
tion. 
A native son of Cleveland, OH, Garry 
enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 
1969. As a member of the 198th Infantry 
Brigade in South Vietnam, he served 
on the Batangan Peninsula. During a 
combat patrol operation on April 9, 
1970, he was severely wounded by a land 
mine explosion. 
After 18 months and multiple sur-
geries at Walter Reed Medical Army 
Hospital, Garry returned home to 
Cleveland, where he continued physical 
rehabilitation. 
Following 
his 
time 
in 
uniform, 
Garry’s commitment to serving others 
never faded. In 1978, Garry went on to 
earn a bachelor’s degree with honors 
from Ohio University and a master’s 
degree in sociology from Cleveland 
State University in 1983. That same 
year, he became a life member of DAV 
Chapter 42 in Mentor, OH. 
In Mentor, he served in various posi-
tions, including chapter commander 
and adjutant, and on statewide com-
mittees, as well as director of service 
for the DAV Department of Ohio. He 
was also selected as one of the Out-
standing Young Men of America in 
1989. 
Along the way, Garry met and mar-
ried his loving wife Kelly Lambing and 
raised two children, Chelsea and Kyle. 
He was rightfully proud of them, and 
spoke of them often. 
He began his tenure with DAV in 1988 
as a hospital service coordinator for 
the Department of Ohio at the Cleve-
land Wade Park VA Hospital. That 
same year, he joined DAV’s profes-
sional staff as a national service officer 
apprentice and went on to serve as as-
sistant supervisor and supervisor at 
the national service office in Cleve-
land. 
Eventually, Garry left this role to 
help lead DAV’s efforts nationwide. He 
was appointed to assistant national 
service director at DAV’s Washington 
headquarters in 2002 and then deputy 
national service director in 2004 and 
national service director in 2010. 
He was named as Washington head-
quarters executive director in 2013, 
where he was tasked with overseeing 
DAV’s service and legislative programs 
and leading DAV’s advocacy efforts on 
behalf of more than 1 million DAV 
members. 
As executive director of DAV, Garry 
was in charge of an organization that 
has always been at the forefront of ad-
vocating for veterans and securing the 
resources, healthcare, and benefits vet-
erans have earned. In the position, he 
was a tireless and successful advocate 
for VA healthcare reform, expanding 
caregiver benefits, securing critical re-
sources for veterans’ initiatives, mod-
ernizing the disability appeals system, 
and improving VA care and services for 
women veterans. 
As the top Democrat on the Senate 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee and Com-
mittee member since 2007, it was a 
great honor of mine to work with 
Garry and DAV on countless important 
pieces of legislation like the Deborah 
Sampson Act, the Veterans Appeals 
Improvement and Modernization Act, 
and the VA MISSION Act. 
These bipartisan efforts, many of 
which were signed into law, serve as a 
testament to Garry’s dedication and 
leadership on behalf of all veterans. 
Future generations of veterans will 
look at these bipartisan reforms and 
feel the reach of his mission to serve 
veterans in their communities. 
Garry’s enduring legacy lives on at 
DAV, which—thanks to his leader-
ship—continues to be a cornerstone for 
communities across the Nation. 
After three decades of service to 
DAV, Garry retired as executive direc-
tor on December 17, 2018, and moved to 
Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Even in his 
retirement, he continued to use his ex-
perience to serve as a strategic adviser 
on veterans’ healthcare technology. 
On March 14, 2022, Garry passed away 
in Washington, DC at the age of 71 
years old. He is survived by his wife 
Kelly, daughter Chelsea, son Kyle, and 
grandson Austin, and will be laid to 
rest at Arlington National Cemetery. 
It is my honor to recognize Garry’s 
lifetime of service as a soldier, veteran, 
and leader of DAV—but also as a loving 
husband and father. On behalf of my-
self and a grateful nation, I extend my

be felt by veterans nationwide for 
years to come, and he will be sorely 
missed.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING T. ROWE PRICE 
GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to take this opportunity to con-
gratulate T. Rowe Price and its devel-
opment team on moving forward on 
building its new global headquarters in 
my home State of Maryland. T. Rowe 
Price has offices in 16 countries, but 
continues its long-standing commit-
ment to Maryland by building its new 
global headquarters, with its thousands 
of employees, in Baltimore—what a 
wonderful testament to Baltimore. 
I am proud that T. Rowe Price has 
been a great partner in the areas of re-
tirement security policy and innova-
tion as I advance legislation to create 
a more robust retirement system for 
all Americans. This is no surprise given 
the founding mission of the company. 
In 1937, Thomas Rowe Price sought to 
create an organization ‘‘with a reputa-
tion for the highest character and 
soundest investment strategy.’’ In the 
1950s, T. Rowe Price focused on grow-
ing their research in the area and 
greatly expanded their associate ranks 
in the 1960s. From the beginning, T. 
Rowe Price has been client-centered 
and collaborative in its research. T. 
Rowe Price grew from a five-person 
firm serving local clients to a 300-per-
son firm serving clients nationwide. 
This is the type of entrepreneurship we 
strive to support and encourage at the 
Small Business Committee. In 1979, T. 
Rowe Price launched its international 
joint venture with Robert Fleming, 
which expanded T. Rowe Price into sev-
eral locations around the world. 
It is an honor that even through the 
phases of expansion, T. Rowe Price has 
maintained its long tenure in Mary-
land, starting with its headquarters in 
Baltimore at 10 Light Street in the 
1930s and continuing its presence in 
Baltimore by investing in a new global 
headquarters at Harbor Point as part 
of the historic redevelopment of the 
area. In addition to the building’s con-
tribution to developing a long unoccu-
pied space in downtown Baltimore, the 
headquarters will be LEED-certified 
with high environmental standards, 
contributing to a sustainable Balti-
more. 
As T. Rowe Price continues to help 
clients reach long-term financial goals, 
including a stable and dignified retire-
ment, it utilizes technological ad-
vancements to ensure the firm reaches 
as many people as possible. In 2017, T. 
Rowe Price celebrated its 80th anniver-
sary of serving Marylanders and people 
across the globe. I have heard from 
countless Marylanders about the posi-
tive impact this company has had on 
their communities. Not only through 
their intentional presence in the State 
and their sound financial strategy, but 
also through their charitable giving 
and initiatives. John Brother, presi-
dent of the T. Rowe Price Foundation 
and T. Rowe Price Program for Chari-
table Giving, stated that, ‘‘The com-
munities we support all have great as-
sets and needs. To ensure our resources 
are channeled to create the best pos-
sible outcomes, we consult with local 
leaders and community organizations 
to get an informed perspective. We em-
phasize three pillars—education and 
youth development, human services, 
and arts and culture.’’ 
To that end, T. Rowe Price has pro-
vided charitable giving to a range of 
projects with a strong focus on finan-
cial literacy. T. Rowe Price has pub-
lished its Parents, Kids, and Money 
Survey for more than 10 years in order 
to help families work together to im-
prove their money management skills. 
The survey explores the basic financial 
knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of 
both parents and their children to pro-
mote better spending and saving hab-
its. Maryland is grateful for the com-
pany’s continued commitment to in-
vesting in Baltimore and Marylanders 
alike. 
I look forward to seeing T. Rowe 
Price’s continued impact in Maryland 
for decades to come, both in ensuring a 
strong retirement system and through 
ongoing and new projects that support 
Baltimore and Maryland communities. 
Congratulations to T. Rowe Price on 
moving forward on building its new 
global headquarters.∑

RECOGNIZING JACOBSEN 
CONSTRUCTION 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate the entire Jacob-
sen Construction team on celebrating 
their centennial of successful oper-
ations, an incredible milestone and cul-
mination of their sustained hard work 
and ingenuity. 
As an employee-owned enterprise, 
each and every member of the Jacobsen 
community should feel a sense of pride 
in Jacobsen’s legacy of building up 
communities here in Utah and around 
the world. Teamwork is the key ingre-
dient of the company’s success. 
Utah is one of the fastest growing 
States in the Nation, and Jacobsen has 
been consistently reliable in helping 
our State accommodate its growth and 
remain prepared for major projects and 
improvements. Jacobsen’s presence is 
felt throughout the State. Its logo dis-
plays prominently on a myriad of 
projects, evidence of the deep and far- 
reaching impact the company has on 
Utah’s economic strength. 
From humble beginnings at the dawn 
of the 20th century, Jacobsen now 
holds its head high over our skylines 
and in our communities, providing us 
places of work, worship, health, and 
recreation. As the Jacobsen team re-
flects on its past century of prosperity, 
may they continue to build on their 
success for the next 100 years and many 
more.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1272 
March 21, 2022 
S. RES. 554 
Whereas 1 in every 691 babies born in the 
United States has Down syndrome, and only 
1 in every 1,100 worldwide; 
Whereas Down syndrome is the most fre-
quent chromosomal condition and occurs in 
all racial, ethnic, and economic groups; 
Whereas individuals with Down syndrome 
attend school, work, make their own life de-
cisions, have meaningful relationships, vote, 
and contribute to society; 
Whereas advancements in education, med-
ical care, research, and advocacy and posi-
tive support from family, friends, and the 
community contribute to individuals with 
Down syndrome living healthy and fulfilling 
lives; 
Whereas promoting inclusive education, 
competitive integrated employment, and 
home and community-based services for indi-
viduals with Down syndrome is vital to indi-
viduals with Down syndrome achieving inde-
pendence, economic self-sufficiency, and full 
participation in society; 
Whereas the life expectancy of individuals 
with Down syndrome in the United States 
has increased dramatically in recent dec-
ades, from 25 years of age in 1983 to 60 years 
of age in 2022; 
Whereas racial and ethnic minorities with 
Down syndrome experience life expectancy 
and health care disparities, which should be 
understood and addressed; 
Whereas individuals with Down syndrome 
have different health profiles than other in-
dividuals, as individuals with Down syn-
drome are predisposed to develop certain 
major diseases, such as autoimmune dis-
orders, leukemia, and Alzheimer’s disease, 
and may not experience other major dis-
eases, such as solid tumor cancers, certain 
heart attacks, and stroke; 
Whereas individuals with Down syndrome 
should have access to health care providers 
who have easy access to updated, evidence- 
based medical care guidelines for children 
and adults with Down syndrome; 
Whereas parents of babies and children 
with Down syndrome should receive the edu-
cation and support they need to understand 
Down Syndrome; 
Whereas, on October 8, 2008, the Prenatally 
and 
Postnatally 
Diagnosed 
Conditions 
Awareness Act (Public Law 110–374; 122 Stat. 
4051) was enacted to increase referrals in the 
United States to providers of key support 
services for mothers who have received a 
positive prenatal diagnosis for Down syn-
drome or a positive diagnosis for other pre-
natally or postnatally diagnosed conditions; 
Whereas the United States, along with 
over 100 other countries, officially observes 
the date March 21 as World Down Syndrome 
Day, because Down syndrome occurs when an 
individual is born with 3 copies of chro-
mosome 21; and 
Whereas the inherent dignity and worth of 
individuals with Down syndrome, the valu-
able contributions of individuals with Down 
syndrome as promoters of well-being and di-
versity within their communities, and the 
importance of the individual freedom and 
independence of individuals with Down syn-
drome should be recognized: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 2022 as ‘‘World Down 
Syndrome Month’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of World 
Down Syndrome Month; 
(3) celebrates the significant contributions 
that individuals with Down syndrome make 
to their families, their communities, the 
United States, and the world; 
(4) is committed to promoting the health, 
education, employment, well-being, commu-
nity inclusion and support, and inherent dig-
nity of all children and adults with Down 
syndrome; 
(5) supports the advancement of scientific 
and medical research benefitting individuals 
with Down syndrome through the national 
and international endeavors of the National 
Institutes of Health, including through the 
INCLUDE project, focused on improving 
health outcomes for individuals with Down 
Syndrome; and 
(6) encourages awareness and education re-
garding Down syndrome, including for new 
and expectant parents.

March 21, 2022 
INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL 
GIFT SHOP TAX ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 21, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Federal Gift Shop Tax 
Act, which would allow state and local govern-
ments to impose a sales tax at gift shops on 
federal property. These governments would be 
able to generate millions of dollars in new tax 
revenue. 
When the federal government engages in 
activity that is not inherently governmental, 
such as operating a gift shop, there is no rea-
son to exempt customer purchases from a 
sales tax. The items sold at federal gift shops, 
such as jewelry, apparel, accessories, games 
and books, would be subject to sales tax if 
sold on private property. Customers are often 
unaware of the exemption from sales tax at 
gift shops on federal property, so the introduc-
tion of a sales tax is unlikely to have a signifi-
cant impact on gift shop sales. It would, how-
ever, create a valuable revenue stream for 
state and local governments. In addition, state 
and local governments often provide uncom-
pensated services for federal property, such 
as fire service, and allowing them to impose a 
sales tax at gift shops on federal property 
would allow them to recoup some of these 
costs. 
This bill is of particular importance to the 
District of Columbia, which is home to a num-
ber of gift shops on federal property, such as 
at the Smithsonian Institution, the National 
Gallery of Art and the John F. Kennedy Center 
for the Performing Arts. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

pionship won by the Wellington-Napoleon

achievement is the result of strong leadership 
and years of dedication from players and 
coaches alike, and it is truly an honor to rec-
ognize this exemplary group of athletes from 
the Fifth District of Missouri. 
After falling just 7 points short of a state 
championship 1 year ago, the motto for the 
entire team all year long has been ‘‘unfinished 
business.’’ This sense of drive and determina-
tion to not only return to the state champion-
ship game, but to cut down the nets this time 
around, was reflected in the team’s dominant 
season, with 28 victories and a mere two 
losses. Winning their last 19 games in a row, 
the Lady Tigers earned a reputation a one of 
the most fiercely competitive teams throughout 
the State of Missouri. Led by Head Coach 
Andy Hampton, the Wellington-Napoleon girls 
basketball team faced off against the Ellington 
Whippets in a rematch of last year’s title game 
on Saturday, March 12, at the JQH Arena in 
Springfield, Missouri. This year, however, the 
Lady Tigers prevailed. 
Playing exceptional defense for the duration 
of the game, Wellington-Napoleon kept the 
Whippets from scoring a single field goal 
throughout the third quarter while only allowing 
three baskets in the entire second half. The 
Lady Tigers’ seven blocks and nine steals 
were backed up by outstanding offensive per-
formances from Ayden Shannon, Bree Shan-
non, and Kaylin Ellensohn, who scored 46 of 
their team’s 52 points. Fulfilling their ultimate 
goal for the season, the Wellington-Napoleon 
girls basketball team won the Class 2 State 
Championship in decisive fashion, with a 52– 
31 victory over Ellington. With the state trophy 
making its way home to Wellington-Napoleon, 
it brings me great joy in saying that hard work 
and dedication has paid off once again. This 
victory marks the first state championship this 
program has won, but I have no doubt that 
more will follow. 
The Lady Tigers’ tremendous success this 
season is just one of many achievements to 
come for the players and the coaching staff. 
One of the remarkable aspects of competitive 
athletics is that it opens up a wide range of 
opportunities in other walks of life. Some of 
these young women will continue their basket-
ball careers at colleges and universities; all of 
them will hold and cherish memories from 
their time at Wellington-Napoleon, where they 
learned what it meant to work as a team in 
pursuit of a common goal. Indeed, these life 
lessons will only prove more valuable as time 
goes on. I am proud of everyone who made 
this season possible—from the players and 
their parents, to the coaches and the loyal 
fans—and I look forward to seeing where life 
takes each of these promising student-ath-
letes. I wish all of these young women the 
best of luck going forward, and once again I 
want to express how extraordinarily proud I 
am of this team and their achievements. On 
behalf of Missouri’s Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict, congratulations on such a successful 
season. 
Madam Speaker, please join with me in 
celebrating the Wellington-Napoleon Lady Ti-
gers basketball team and the State Champion-
ship they have brought home. Here’s to taking 
care of business.

COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF U.S.-BANGLADESH 
BILATERAL RELATIONS 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 21, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the upcoming Independence and 
National Day of Bangladesh and the 50th An-
niversary of U.S.-Bangladesh bilateral rela-
tions. 
Bangladesh is a beacon in a region which 
has historically and even currently today been 
marred with conflict. Despite these challenges, 
Bangladesh has held firm as a democracy 
which is why our countries cooperate so 
closely on a range of issues, including eco-
nomic development, security, and governance. 
As our countries progress and meet new chal-
lenges, our bond remains strong as evidenced 
by our collaboration as the world confronts the 
challenges of COVID–19, counter-terrorism, 
and more. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating this remarkable milestone 
between our two countries and the independ-
ence and achievements of Bangladesh. Our 
nations have accomplished a great deal to-
gether for the advancement of freedom, and 
as our relationship proves its strength as we 
confront new challenges in the 21st century, I 
am excited for what the future holds for our 
two great nations.
