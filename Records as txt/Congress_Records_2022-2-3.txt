DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
You are the Lord, You alone. You 
have made the Heavens with all their 
host, the Earth and all that is on it, 
the seas and all that is in them. To 
each and every living creature You 
give life; all of Heaven worships You. 
So may we be a nation at prayer. In 
Your merciful hands we place the pro-
tection of our country, the welfare of 
its citizens. 
We humble ourselves before You this 
day and confess our wanderings from 
You. May we return to You and receive 
Your promise to heal our land. 
Thus, may our contrition inspire our 
recommitment to the people and pur-
poses You have called us to serve. May 
our repentance be the foundation of 
faith which brings forth Your favor 
over this Nation. May our remorse be-
come the reason for reconciliation with 
those with whom we disagree deeply. 
Bless us, O Lord, and embolden us— 
as individuals, as a body, as a nation— 
to live lives holy and acceptable in 
Your sight. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
TLAIB) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. TLAIB led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
HISTORY CANNOT BE ERASED 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a printing of a painting 
done by a talented Detroit artist, Jona-
than Harris. 
Jonathan named the painting ‘‘Crit-
ical Race Theory.’’ It gives me chills as 
I look at it on how the contrived fight 
against our history, Black history spe-
cifically, seeks to erase the fight, 
struggle, triumphs, and success of our 
Black neighbors in our country. 
So as many of us recognize and cele-
brate Black History Month, I implore 
those who are pushing to erase our his-
tory, including many colleagues in this 
body, to stop with the empty words and 
gestures. You cannot erase history to 
paint the picture you want. We won’t 
stand for it. 
f 
BORDER CRISIS BECOMES A 
FENTANYL CRISIS 
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today because every State is now a bor-
der State. A border crisis is now a 
fentanyl crisis. But don’t take it from 
me, take it from the sheriffs in my dis-
trict. 
Bartholomew County Sheriff Matt 
Myers said, ‘‘Fentanyl is coming into 
our country from our southern border. 
It is becoming an increasing problem, 
and it is killing our citizens.’’ 
Randolph 
County 
Sheriff 
Art 
Moystner said, ‘‘Our guys on the 
ground tell us they know these drugs 
are coming through Dayton via the 
southern border.’’ 
Hancock 
County 
Sheriff 
Brad 
Burkhart said, ‘‘Illegal drugs coming 
across the border affects everyone, and 
Indiana is not immune.’’ 
In Decatur County, Sheriff Dave Dur-
ant explained it like this, ‘‘Fentanyl in 
our communities is not just a thing, it 
is the thing.’’ 
Democrats, stop downplaying this 
crisis. It is killing Hoosiers in Indiana. 
f 
LUNAR NEW YEAR IS A TIME OF 
CELEBRATION 
(Ms. BASS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, Lunar 
New Year is a time of celebration for so 
many people in Los Angeles and mil-
lions around the world. 
As we welcome the Year of the 
Tiger—a symbol of bravery—we honor 
the history and heritage of the Asian 
Pacific Islander communities across 
America and stand in support and ac-
tive defense in the face of challenges,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

February 3, 2022 
like the rise of anti-Asian violence and 
hate. 
Over the past 2 years, I have been 
greatly alarmed and concerned by what 
I 
have 
seen 
and 
heard 
from 
businessowners, 
restaurant 
owners, 
teachers, parents, and young people in 
my district and across the country. 
To honor the celebration of the 
Lunar New Year, I have cosponsored 
legislation led by my colleague GRACE 
MENG to make Lunar New Year a Fed-
eral holiday in the U.S. 
I want to wish everyone warm wishes 
of health, success, and happiness in the 
years ahead. Though many were not 
able to gather in person with their 
families to celebrate this week, we con-
tinue to forge ahead in our recovery 
from the pandemic. 
f 
FENTANYL-RELATED DEATHS ARE 
RISING 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today deeply alarmed by the in-
crease in fentanyl-related deaths in my 
district. 
According to the San Bernardino 
County sheriff, there were over 100 
fentanyl-related incidents in my dis-
trict in the last year, resulting in the 
death of nearly 100 of my constituents. 
In fact, Madam Speaker, in the last 3 
years, fentanyl-related deaths in my 
community have increased over 600 
percent. According to the sheriff, this 
is a direct result of the trafficking of 
fentanyl across our southern border 
with Mexico. 
Last year the Inland Empire regional 
drug task force seized over 600 pounds 
of fentanyl, and they estimate the ma-
jority of that originated in Mexico. 
Madam Speaker, this is a direct re-
sult of our failure to secure our south-
ern border and the changes in Federal 
policy as relates to the southern border 
that have been enacted in the last 
year. 
Madam Speaker, we must stop this 
trafficking of fentanyl across the bor-
der and protect our community by se-
curing our southern border. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE HONORABLE 
ESTEBAN TORRES 
(Ms. SA´ NCHEZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the life of the late Con-
gressman Esteban Torres, a dedicated 
public servant, trailblazer for Latino 
political power, and a champion for the 
working class. 
Congressman Esteban Torres dedi-
cated his life to serving his commu-
nity, early on as a labor leader and 
eventually in Congress and the White 
House. 
He was among the first Latinos elect-
ed to Congress, paving the way for in-
creased representation across all levels 
of government. 
As a Member of this body, Congress-
man Torres proudly represented the 
community in which he was raised and 
much of the community that I am 
proud to serve today. 
He fought with integrity for the 
rights of immigrants, environmental 
justice, and economic empowerment. 
His legacy will live on in the commu-
nities he represented and in the hearts 
that he touched. 
I send my sincere condolences to his 
family and all who knew him. 
f 
OUR NATIONAL DEBT SHOULD 
SCARE US ALL 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today as our national debt has 
reached the $30 trillion marker for the 
first time in our Nation’s history. This 
enormous figure should scare us all. 
Since 1990, our national debt has 
grown tenfold, and there is no indica-
tion that $30 trillion is the ceiling. 
In Iowa, I helped pass the State law 
that rightfully requires that we spend 
no more than 99 percent of the money 
we take in, creating a balanced budget 
each year. 
This is exactly what we should be 
doing in our Federal Government. We 
cannot continue to print money, in-
crease our debt, and ask Iowans to foot 
the bill. 
As a strong fiscal hawk, I will con-
tinue to fight against the wasteful 
pork-barrel spending that fuels infla-
tion, raises taxes, and increases the 
cost of living on every family. 
This is exactly what Iowans expect 
from me, and I plan to deliver. 
f 
ATTEMPTS TO OVERTURN 
ELECTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED 
(Mr. POCAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, the at-
tempted insurrection of our govern-
ment on January 6 last year is a stain 
that will forever live on our country, 
but equally dirty were the other at-
tempts to illegally overturn our No-
vember 2020 elections, including the 
shady Trump campaign efforts to place 
false electors in seven States, includ-
ing my home State of Wisconsin. 
Violent attacks on Capitol Police and 
breaking into the U.S. Capitol are very 
visual scenes of the illegal schemes, 
but we cannot let the more stealthy, 
yet very strategic, plots of trying to 
place illegal electors to overturn the 
will of the voters in swing States go by 
unnoticed or unpunished. 
Just yesterday The New York Times 
released a memo by the Trump cam-
paign written a month and a half prior 
to January 6 setting up the case to in-
stall false electors in Wisconsin and six 
other States. 
The problem with these schemes was 
it also needed complicity from then- 
Vice President Mike Pence, who chose 
his country over his party and didn’t 
illegally overturn the election as the 
Trump campaign wanted. 
Those involved with this illegal at-
tack on our Republic should be inves-
tigated and held accountable by both 
the January 6th Select Committee as 
well as the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Forged documents, false claims, and 
other illegal actions are crimes and are 
no different than the violent attack on 
the Capitol Building itself. And for 
that, our Nation deserves justice. 
f 
REMEMBERING JOHN THOMAS 
LONG 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
my friend John Thomas Long. We all 
knew him as Tom. You know, I got a 
chance to meet Tom Long through my 
former bosses, my former direct boss, 
Craig Roberts, and my big boss at the 
time, a guy named John Shimkus, who 
used to serve in this Chamber. 
Tom was a friend to them, and he im-
mediately became a friend to me. Tom 
was somebody who was a giant in the 
legal community in and around the 
metro east area of Illinois. He served as 
a law clerk for the Department of Jus-
tice. He was the CEO of Argosy Gam-
ing. He was a member of the White 
House advance team. He was a delegate 
to the 1988 Republican Convention, but 
I met him when he was the Madison 
County Republican Party chairman. 
Tom was a guy who was active all 
throughout his community, but what 
he was most active in doing was loving 
his family and making sure his family 
was his highest priority. 
Tom passed away just this past week, 
and my heartfelt prayers and thoughts 
go out to his wife, Robin, and his three 
daughters: Margaret, Erin, and Emma. 
Madison County, Illinois, and Illinois 
and this country lost a giant in Tom 
Long. He will be missed. May God rest 
his soul.

MAKING CRITICAL INVESTMENTS 
IN AMERICA’S FUTURE 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
America COMPETES Act, which in-
cludes two of my amendments. 
This bill includes important provi-
sions that enhance our ability to at-
tract the best talent from around the 
world, such as scientists and engineers

with doctoral degrees. My amendment 
would extend this program to STEM 
graduates with master’s degrees who 
work in fields that are critical to our 
national and economic security. 
The bill also includes funding for 
scholarships for low-income Americans 
to study in the STEM fields. 
The bill also includes my amendment 
to ensure our Nation’s HBCUs, Tribal 
colleges and universities, and other mi-
nority-serving institutions or active 
members of Manufacturing USA insti-
tutes. 
These and other provisions in the 
America COMPETES Act will help us 
create more jobs, sharpen our techno-
logical edge, and make critical invest-
ments in our future. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
f 
PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL SEES HIS 
SHADOW 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, yesterday was a big 
day in the 15th Congressional District 
of Pennsylvania. 
Early in the morning, tens of thou-
sands of spectators gathered at Gob-
bler’s Knob in Jefferson County to 
await the weather prediction from 
Pennsylvania’s most famous ground-
hog, Punxsutawney Phil. 
For over 120 years, our furry friend 
has been predicting our winter weath-
er. This tradition stems from Penn-
sylvania’s strong German heritage. 
Legend has it that if Phil sees his shad-
ow, it is an omen of 6 more weeks of 
winter. If not, we know spring is just 
around the corner. 
Groundhog Day is an unusual event 
full of traditions and celebrations. 
Crowds begin to gather the night be-
fore and wake Phil up by chanting his 
name in the early hours of the morning 
on February 2. As our weather pre-
dictor extraordinaire emerges from his 
burrow, the Punxsutawney Groundhog 
Club Inner Circle president translates 
Phil’s prediction and relays the mes-
sage to the crowd. 
Records of our meteorologist rodent 
date back to 1887, with the first story 
appearing in the Punxsutawney Spirit. 
In the years since, Phil has predicted a 
longer winter 105 times and an early 
spring only 20 times. 
Our seer of seers saw his shadow, 
thus predicting 6 more weeks of cold 
and snowy weather. 
Madam Speaker, let’s keep those 
winter layers close by. Happy Ground-
hog Day. 
f 
RACING TO THE BOTTOM 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, for generations, Americans 
and Canadians have owned homes on 
either side of the border, making many 
of our citizens neighbors in every sense 
of the word. 
The pandemic has hurt the connec-
tions between our two countries, often 
making it difficult for citizens to visit 
their properties. 
Recently, the Canadian Government 
proposed a 1 percent tax on residential 
real estate owned by non-Canadians. 
We believe this tax is not just an unfair 
fine on good neighbors but a violation 
of the United States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement and international tax law. 
We are working with the Biden ad-
ministration to advocate on behalf of 
Americans and urge Canada to reject 
this proposal. Its adoption could lead 
to a race to the bottom for both of our 
countries. 
f 
HONORING ANTHONY SALAS 
(Mr. GONZALES of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GONZALES of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in memory of El 
Paso native Special Agent Anthony 
Salas. 
Anthony was with the DPS for 9 
years. Prior to that, Anthony served in 
the Marines. He was a true patriot. 
Anthony sadly passed away on Janu-
ary 22. He is survived by his wife, 
Lizzett, 
and 
his 
three 
children: 
Alessandra, Isabella, and Luke. 
Anthony was a special operations 
group operator involved in a traffic 
crash during the arrest of six migrants 
in Eagle Pass. Maverick County sadly 
has become the epicenter of the border 
crisis. 
Agents put their lives on the line 
every single day. My heart goes out to 
his family, and America is grateful for 
his service. 
f 
REGAINING AMERICA’S INDEPEND-
ENCE IN CHIPS MANUFACTURING 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the America COM-
PETES Act. 
No piece of legislation is more impor-
tant to this Nation’s future. It is about 
our national security. It is about our 
economic well-being. 
This bill is about regaining our inde-
pendence in semiconductor chip manu-
facturing. 
This bill is about keeping our fac-
tories open and about American jobs. 
The America COMPETES Act also in-
cludes my legislation, the HOPR Act, 
that says uniforms worn by our front-
line DHS personnel must be made in 
America by Americans. 
Let’s get busy and remind the rest of 
the world what made in America is all 
about. It is about making the best. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
America COMPETES Act. 
AMERICA FIRST REEMERGING 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
the left is trying to block America 
First warriors from appearing on the 
ballot in 2024, and their path to victory 
begins or ends with me. 
They are after the American people, 
but MAGA fighters in Congress are in 
the way. 
The Washington elites are panicked. 
Their savior Joe Biden is a withering, 
blundering failure. They feel the birth 
pangs of America First reemergence. 
What 
is 
their 
solution, 
Madam 
Speaker, to stop us patriots from re-
turning to office? Well, they filed a 
challenge 
to 
disenfranchise 
voters 
across the Nation and block America 
First candidates from appearing on the 
ballot. And they started with me. 
I promise you, they will fail. 
But their efforts and the deep state’s 
work to shut down Trump and his sup-
porters will ramp up. Watch what hap-
pens to the January 6 prisoners. They 
will become a nationwide template for 
what the regime will do to all of us. 
MAGA fighters in Congress are in the 
way of their agenda, so they have to 
come for us first. 
But to MAGA patriots across the Na-
tion, pay attention. If they take us 
down, they will come for you next. 
But take hope. God and the people 
are on our side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
HONORING ALTON ADAMS, SR. 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
today, I would like to honor Virgin Is-
lander Alton Adams, Sr., and express 
my gratitude to the U.S. Navy for the 
creation of the Alton Augustus Adams 
Sr. Award for Emerging Composers. 
Adams, born in 1889 in the Virgin Is-
lands, was the first Black bandmaster 
of the U.S. Navy and led an all-Black 
Navy band during a period of racial 
segregation. 
Adams played the flute and piccolo 
and composed songs such as ‘‘The Gov-
ernor’s Own’’ and ‘‘The Virgin Islands 
March.’’ In 1924, Adams toured the Na-
tion with his band and won the esteem 
of fellow bandmasters, but his nomina-
tion for membership in the American 
Bandmasters Association was denied in 
1936. Nearly 70 years later, he received 
the honor, in 2006, and has been recog-
nized for his contributions. 
Composers recognizing the work of 
rising composers whose work reflects 
the legacy of this leader can receive 
the Alton Augustus Adams Sr. Award 
for Emerging Composers. 
I thank the U.S. Navy, and I thank 
Alton Adams. Have a blessed Black 
History Month.

February 3, 2022 
HONORING OFFICER CHRISTOPHER 
WAYNE BERRY 
(Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, today, I rise to recognize the life of 
Officer Christopher Wayne Berry, a 
member of the Vidor Police Depart-
ment in Orange County, Texas. 
Officer Berry was a dedicated public 
servant and an inspiration to the com-
munity that he cherished so dearly. 
Ever since he was a boy, Chris want-
ed to be a police officer, Madam Speak-
er. Not only did he achieve that dream, 
Chris went on to serve honorably as a 
keeper of the peace for over 30 years. 
Those who knew him will tell you 
that he always treated anyone he met 
with the utmost respect. He will for-
ever be remembered as a kindhearted 
community servant who was always 
willing to lend a helping hand. 
In addition to being a well-respected 
member of the Vidor Police force, 
Chris was also an avid outdoorsman 
who enjoyed hunting, fishing, bee-
keeping, and gardening. 
Officer Berry is survived by his wife, 
Brenda, and their three children: Bai-
ley, Brayden, and Amber. He is also 
survived by his parents, Norman and 
Loretta Berry, as well as his brothers: 
Mike, Stephen, and Michael Berry. 
Madam Speaker, may Officer Chris 
Berry rest in peace. He will be sorely 
missed. 
f 
CELEBRATING RUBY ELLEN 
TALLEY’S 90TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. LATURNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LATURNER. Madam Speaker, 
today, I come to the floor to celebrate 
the 90th birthday of one of my most 
important constituents, my Grandma 
Ruby. 
Ruby Ellen Talley was born February 
9, 1932. Grandma Ruby married my late 
grandfather, Joe LaTurner, on October 
5, 1951. Together, they have 6 children, 
14 
grandchildren, 
26 
great-grand-
children, 
and 
2 
great-great-grand-
children. 
Nursing was her profession, but what 
is clearly most important to her is 
faith and family. As matriarch of the 
LaTurner family, Grandma Ruby has 
aggressively instilled the values of 
honesty, hard work, empathy, and al-
ways caring more about the one who is 
down on their luck. 
For me personally, she helped raise 
me, and I hear her voice in my head 
every single day, insisting that I have 
both confidence and humility. I hear 
my Grandma Ruby say, as I have 
throughout my entire life, that I am 
the best and can achieve anything I am 
willing to work hard enough for. And I 
also hear her saying maybe even loud-
er: ‘‘Don’t get too big for your britch-
es.’’ 
I would not be standing on this floor 
today without her. I love my Grandma 
Ruby dearly, and I wish her a very 
happy 90th birthday. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ROGER 
NICHOLSON 
(Mrs. BOEBERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of my 
friend, Roger Nicholson. 
I love this photo because this was a 
really great day with two of Roger’s, I 
like to say, greatest friends. Maurice 
was his buddy that he traveled all over 
Colorado with, and Roger caused a lot 
of trouble on the way, too. 
Roger is the embodiment of what I 
love about Coloradans, with his fight-
ing spirit and grand vision for the fu-
ture and his faith in the American 
Dream. 
Roger immigrated to the United 
States legally as a child. And starting 
from nothing, his mother gave every-
thing to build a life for their family 
through the promise of opportunity. 
Roger often told me how I reminded 
him of his mom. I will cherish that 
comparison all my life. 
The lessons Roger learned from his 
mother’s grit pushed him forward as he 
strove to make something great out of 
his life as a businessman; a friend to 
all; most importantly, a husband to his 
beautiful bride, Bobbie; a fierce father; 
and a loving grandfather. 
Roger was my friend—stubborn, or-
nery, funny, and driven. Roger’s sup-
port was rock solid, and his dedication 
to the fight for freedom was un-
matched. 
Roger’s legacy will live on through 
the conservative movement in his com-
munity and in his family. 
To spend time with Roger was to live 
in the moment and cherish every spo-
ken word. Even during our last con-
versation, Roger was full of spunk and 
optimism. Joy was his strength until 
the end. 
My friend Roger understood life, and 
he had the tough skin and tender heart 
to prove it. 
I love you, Roger, and we miss you

HONORING ROBERT C. WHITE 
(Mr. FLEISCHMANN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the service of 
Mr. Robert C. ‘‘Bob’’ White. 
For 11 years, Bob has served the peo-
ple of Tennessee’s Third Congressional 
District, first as my field representa-
tive, then as my deputy district direc-
tor, and finally, as my senior adviser. 
Bob has been instrumental in helping 
myself and my office do the people’s 
work in the House of Representatives. 
Bob retired last month from his ca-
reer in public service. Throughout his 
tenure as a public servant, he cease-
lessly showed what we are all here to 
do: to serve our constituents, those 
who have elected us to represent them 
in Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Bob for his 
service, friendship, and devotion to our 
State and Nation. I wish him success in 
the next chapter of his illustrious ca-
reer.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
MISTY APRIL HOLLEY 
(Mr. CRENSHAW asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate the life of 
Misty April Holley, who we lost on No-
vember 20, 2021, in Houston, Texas. 
I will do my best to give the world a 
glimpse of who Misty was. And I would 
like to do that using the words of her 
father, Ron Holley. 
Here is how Ron describes his beloved 
daughter: 
Misty spread love and charity to ev-
eryone she knew. Misty was a person 
full of grace who fully owned her short-
comings and gave out forgiveness free-
ly to all. She knew in her heart that we 
are all of one race, the human race. Hu-
manity would do well to learn lessons 
of love and charity from her. 
Misty was fueled by dreams and aspi-
rations of what could and should be. 
She could make you laugh, make you 
sad, and sometimes frustrated. She 
evoked feelings you didn’t know you 
had. In short, she would keep you real. 
She was above all pretenses. 
We will miss her contagious laugh. 
Without Misty, the world feels lacking. 
But somehow, we will laugh again. 
Misty would have it no other way. We 
will see you on the other side. 
Madam Speaker, and my colleagues, 
please join me in praying for the 
Holley family, Misty’s friends, and ev-
eryone she touched. May the strength 
of the Lord be with them as they en-
dure the tremendous loss of a wonder-
ful life taken much too soon.

RECOGNIZING MINOCQUA’S 
OLYMPIAN SKIER, KEVIN BOLGER

Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of one of 
Minocqua, 
Wisconsin’s, 
very 
own, 
Kevin Bolger, who is headed to the 2022 
Winter Olympics. He started skiing in 
the third grade after following in the 
footsteps of his older brother. By the 
way, this family has been a corner-
stone of the community in Minocqua, 
Wisconsin, for over 100 years. 
It was clear from a young age that 
Kevin was a natural, and his interest in 
the sport continued to grow over the 
years. 
His journey to the Olympics isn’t 
like most of his teammates. After grad-
uating from high school, he opted out

of going straight to college. Instead, 
Kevin moved to Idaho and joined the 
Sun Valley Ski Education Foundation 
where they had a program for kids tak-
ing a gap year. There he met and 
worked with his current ski coach for 2 
years before applying to the University 
of Utah. He went to the University of 
Utah for 4 years, winning a national 
title his senior year. 
After 3 years on Team USA, he made 
his first Olympic cut earlier this year 
and will be headed to Beijing as a first- 
time Olympian. 
Congratulations, Kevin Bolger, and 
best of luck.

BIDEN LETTERS ON AFGHANISTAN 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, on August 26, remarks 
regarding the terrorist attack at the 
Kabul, Afghanistan, airport, with the 
murder of 13 American servicemem-
bers, the Commander in Chief stated 
that military leaders have contacted 
him, ‘‘ . . . usually by letter, saying 
they subscribe to the mission as de-
signed. . . . ’’ 
That evening, I sent the first of four 
letters to the White House asking for 
all letters referenced, with no reply. 
The decision to withdraw U.S. forces 
from Afghanistan abandoning Ameri-
cans has been correctly identified by 
President Donald Trump as the worst 
foreign policy disaster ever for Amer-
ican families. This leads to murderous 
attacks over open borders into Amer-
ica. 
Where is the American media on this 
crucial issue of the claimed Afghani-
stan letters? 
Sadly, no response from the White 
House reveals admission of no letters. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
moves from the safe haven in Afghani-
stan to America.

ANSWERS ON RFS TARGETS 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, biofuels drive the rural econ-
omy and strengthen our energy secu-
rity. Two weeks ago, President Biden’s 
agriculture Secretary suggested it was 
unfair of me to suggest that he wasn’t 
doing enough for biofuels. 
This week, the Biden EPA announced 
that they are delaying RFS deadlines, 
which creates uncertainty for Amer-
ican farmers. Instead of putting Amer-
ican farmers first, the Biden adminis-
tration is pushing Chinese batteries 
and Green New Deal policies. 
The Biden administration must stop 
creating uncertainty for the biofuels 
industry and misleading our farmers 
about support for biofuels. We need 
clear answers from the Biden adminis-
tration on RFS blending targets.

AMENDMENT NO. 22 OFFERED BY MS. JAYAPAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 22 
printed in part D of House Report 117– 
241. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to offer amendment 22 as a des-
ignee of Congressman JAMAAL BOWMAN. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the appropriate place in title II of divi-
sion D, insert the following: 
SEC. ll. REPORT ON IMPACT OF SANCTIONS ON 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION 
THAT ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRI-
SIS AND PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL 
JUSTICE. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress as follows: 
(1) The climate crisis is the single biggest 
health threat facing humanity and unprece-
dented levels of global cooperation and col-
laboration are necessary for basic security 
provided by equitable access to food produc-
tion, access to fresh water, habitable ambi-
ent temperature and ocean food chains. 
(2) The frequency and severity of extreme 
weather events, such as wildfire, cyclones, 
floods and droughts are increasing world-
wide, significantly impacting the environ-
ment, and displacing people from their 
homes, resulting in growing numbers of cli-
mate refugees. 
(3) Substantially scaling up a range of in-
vestments to address the climate crisis, in-
cluding development assistance and green 
tech transfer, are necessary to meet the goal 
of limiting global warming to not more than 
1.5 degrees Celsius. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 90 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of State, in coordination with the 
Secretary of the Department of Energy, shall 
submit a report to the appropriate congres-
sional committees that— 
(1) describes the impact of United States 
sanctions on opportunities for innovation 
that address the climate crisis and promote 
environmental justice; 
(2) describes the impact of sanctions on cli-
mate diplomacy and low-carbon development 
assistance; and 
(3) identifies barriers to reducing green-
house gas emissions and reliance on fossil 
fuels caused or exacerbated by United States 
sanctions. 
(c) FORM.—The report required by sub-
section (b) shall be submitted in unclassified 
form. 
(d) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES.—For purposes of this section, the term 
‘‘appropriate 
congressional 
committees’’ 
means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the 
Committee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology, and the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce of the House of Representatives; 
and 
(2) the Committee on Commerce, Science 
and Transportation, the Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources, and the Com-
mittee on Environment and Public Works of 
the Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I first want to offer 
my congratulations to the chairwoman 
of the committee for this very, very 
important piece of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as the 
designee of Congressman JAMAAL BOW-
MAN to offer this amendment. The cli-
mate crisis is the single biggest threat 
facing humanity, and if we are going to 
address it at the scale needed to limit 
global warming to not more than 1.5 
degrees Celsius, we are going to have to 
work together. We are going to need 
unprecedented levels of global coopera-
tion and collaboration to meet every-
one’s basic needs, including food, clean 
water, and keeping the communities 
we call home habitable. 
At the same time, we increasingly 
rely upon sanctions as a key foreign 
policy lever. The material impact of 
sanctions is known to undermine the 
human rights of civilians who can get 
cut off from access to basic needs, 
often the same basic needs that are 
threatened by the very climate crisis, 
as we see increasingly more frequent 
extreme weather events. 
This amendment would simply re-
quire the State Department to issue a 
report in coordination with the Depart-
ment of Energy on the impact that 
sanctions have on our ability to be in-
novative in addressing the climate cri-
sis and economic justice. This will give 
us important information as we seek to 
create and craft sanctions or under-
stand the impact of sanctions and de-
cide not to use them. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I claim time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to amend-
ment 22. I believe this amendment will 
undermine our ability to appropriately 
deal with human rights abuses and ag-
gressions towards the United States. 
This amendment would require the 
Secretary of State in coordination with 
the Secretary of Energy to submit a re-
port to Congress on how U.S. sanctions 
are affecting our ability to adapt to 
climate change and promote environ-
mental justice, among other things. 
First, let me remind my friends 
across the aisle that we are meant to 
be discussing the competitiveness bill 
today, not a climate bill. This bill is 
meant to address the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s growing aggression and

to ensure the United States remains 
the world leader in science and tech-
nology. 
This amendment doesn’t prioritize 
our competitiveness, and it doesn’t 
help us face the threat from China. 
Worst, it could hinder our abilities to 
address that threat. 
Let’s not forget sanctions are for 
countries that have committed inex-
cusable offenses against their own peo-
ple or the United States. 
It seems to me that the purpose of 
this amendment is to show that our 
sanctions against China, who is com-
mitting forced labor crimes every day, 
are actually hurting progress towards 
adapting to climate change. 
Essentially, this amendment places 
technological adaptations to climate 
change on the same footing as forced 
labor and genocide. I fully believe that 
the United States has the capacity to 
develop innovative technologies to con-
tinue to reduce our emission and miti-
gate the effects of climate change. And 
I do not accept that to do this, we need 
to prioritize China’s innovation over 
their use of forced labor. 
Addressing climate change does not 
require sacrificing American ideals and 
standards. We can best address global 
climate change by innovating in Amer-
ica and holding China accountable, not 
by giving them a pass. I would much 
rather look at how the United States 
can encourage more participation in 
research and development than drive 
innovation. 
Let’s support our research enterprise, 
our workforce, our access to domestic 
critical minerals and, yes, let’s actu-
ally identify innovative ways that we 
can combat global climate change. 
Not once has the Department of En-
ergy or the National Science Founda-
tion come to us to say that our stance 
against forced labor or child labor is 
hindering their ability to research, de-
velop, and demonstrate clean energy 
technologies. This is a made-up prob-
lem, which this report is trying to 
solve with a pre-determined solution. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support your constituents 
by putting the United States first and 
opposing this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t really under-
stand—and with tremendous respect to 
my colleague across the aisle—how as-
signing a report so that we can get 
more information about the effect of 
sanctions on the people of a country 
undermines in any way anything that 
we are trying to do in this bill. In fact, 
competitiveness 
is 
deeply 
tied 
to 
whether or not we adhere to human 
rights values that the United States 
holds very dear. And the question of 
how we can be most effective in our 
policy is very important to this bill. 
So I really don’t understand why we 
wouldn’t want the information that a 
report is going to generate unless we 
are afraid that it is going to present 
some choice that feels very difficult to 
us. So I am not sure why there would 
be resistance to a report that says, De-
partment of Energy, in coordination 
with the State Department, tell us 
what impact sanctions have on our 
ability to be innovative, one of the key 
goals of this bill, in addressing the cli-
mate crisis and economic justice. 
Let’s not disentangle competitive-
ness from justice. Let’s not disentangle 
competitiveness from our ability to up-
hold our core values as a country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I think my opening 
statement made the point that this is 
actually conflating two issues and 
shouldn’t. And so for that reason, I 
strongly oppose the amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairwoman EDDIE 
BERNICE JOHNSON and all of the chairs 
of the committees and members who 
helped bring the America COMPETES 
Act to where it is. 
Madam Speaker, today I offer my 
amendment 
to 
the 
America 
COM-
PETES Act. My amendment simply 
adds ‘‘media and entertainment’’ to the 
list of eligible programs for nontradi-
tional industries or occupations. 
b 1245 
The U.S. media and entertainment 
industry plays a prominent role in de-
fining who we are as a nation, not only 
within our borders but across the 
world. The media, as I know the media 
is plural, but the media as an institu-
tion continues to serve as one of the 
main narrative-creating and image-de-
fining institutions conveying Amer-
ica’s values and ideals to audiences 
around the world. 
Yet the lack of diverse talent in the 
industry’s workforce fails to reflect our 
population, 
therefore, 
stunting 
our 
ability to accurately portray the U.S. 
as a multicultural symbol on a global 
scale, and also sidelining millions and 
millions of Americans from partici-
pating in an industry with well-paying 
jobs. 
By expanding apprenticeship pro-
grams, we can build a foundation for 
more Americans to begin professional 
careers in the media industry, particu-
larly those that have been tradition-
ally excluded, such as Latinos and 
other minority communities that are 
often 
underrepresented 
and 
under-
valued. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I claim time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment 
further expands the existing 80-year- 
old apprenticeships system to now in-
clude apprenticeships in ‘‘media and 
entertainment.’’ 
Instead of expanding this program 
that is already bloated with bureauc-
racy, time-consuming paperwork, and 
overly burdensome requirements, this 
bill should be focusing on programs 
that push employer-developed appren-
ticeships that will help our workforce 
expand and thrive. 
I cannot help but ask: What do ap-
prenticeships in media and entertain-
ment have to do with competing with 
the Chinese Communist Party? 
The CCP has dramatically increased 
its STEM workforce. One report pre-
dicts a 300 percent increase in the num-
ber of overall STEM graduates in China 
versus a 30 percent increase in the 
United States. 
Instead of focusing on training the 
next Meryl Streep, we should be fo-
cused on developing America’s STEM 
workforce, especially at the skilled 
technical workforce level. 
If we can’t expand the STEM work-
force through initiatives like innova-
tive apprenticeship models that give

employees the skills they need, we 
won’t be able to maintain the talent 
base that supports key sectors of the 
economy, including agriculture, en-
ergy, healthcare, and defense. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, to address some of 
the concerns, the media and entertain-
ment industry is one that involves dif-
ferent STEM fields such as a wide vari-
ety of engineering positions, for exam-
ple, many of which have gone unfilled 
in different media corporations. 
Also, as the gentlewoman knows, the 
GOP in particular has made a big deal 
about our film industry yielding to dif-
ferent Chinese demands, for example. 
So it is important that our government 
collaborate with the industry to make 
sure that we have a well-prepared 
workforce that is able to, again, make 
sure that the America media is robust. 
We also want to be sure that—as you 
have industries like the media industry 
that continue to, for example, go film 
television and movies overseas, that 
American workers are well-prepared to 
take on those jobs so that industry 
does not have a single excuse to go 
somewhere else but to one of our cities 
and States in the United States. That 
is exactly what this amendment will 
help do, is to bring about a more pre-
pared workforce to take on these roles 
so that industry doesn’t have an excuse 
to go somewhere else. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I would reply to my 
colleague that in Oklahoma we have 
done an incredible job of expanding the 
media 
and 
entertainment 
industry 
within our State without this type of 
program. 
We need to be focusing on STEM in-
novation and STEM workforce. In 
Oklahoma, we could graduate every en-
gineering student from our colleges 
and universities and still be 3,000 engi-
neers short, particularly as we look at 
our military bases in Oklahoma. Fo-
cusing on core industries like energy 
and defense are what we should be 
doing.

ance of my time.

Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I

(e) ANNUAL BRIEFING.—Not later than 90 
days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
and annually thereafter, the Department of 
State, in consultation with the heads of 
other relevant Federal departments and 
agencies, shall provide a briefing to relevant

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
amendment 56, which I was proud to 
offer. 
Madam Speaker, it is no secret what 
the Republican Party thinks of the 
Chinese Communist Party and their at-
tack on our global leadership and the 
threat they pose to our exceptional Na-
tion and the global order we estab-
lished and maintained. 
If you look at the COVID outbreak 
and coverup, the treatment of Uyghurs 
in Xinjiang, or the repression in Hong 
Kong, the facts clearly establish that 
the CCP is unaccountable, unreliable, 
and untruthful. 
While some in this Chamber want to 
think of them as a partner, I cannot 
bring myself down to that level of na-
ivety. 
Let’s call them what they are: they 
are a competitor; they are a threat. 
That is why when I read this bill I was 
shocked to see that Democrats are al-
most being complimentary when they 
refer to China and their emission goals. 
They say China ‘‘is likely to achieve 
its carbon emissions’’ pledge to the 
Paris Agreement, and that their emis-
sions will peak ahead of schedule in 
2030, a full 15 years after they agreed to 
Paris. 
Some Democrats go on to highlight 
China’s pledge to be carbon neutral by 
2060 and to phase down their coal-fired 
power generation. It reads like a press 
release for the Chinese Communist 
Party published in the Global Times or 
something tweeted by the bombastic 
foreign ministry spokesmen, not policy 
from the United States Congress. 
Worst of all, there is not even an at-
tempt to fact check this information. 
Take it as blind fact, despite coming 
from an autocratic, Communist re-
gime. 
Trust but verify will not do here. 
With China it should be do not trust 
until we verify and continue to verify. 
Madam Speaker, are we so naive that 
we take China’s word at face value? I 
believe I speak for my fellow Repub-
licans, and probably a few of my 
friends on the other side of the aisle, 
when I say: No, absolutely not. 
We have no reason to believe the 
Communist leadership that has pub-
licly stated that their goal is to best us 
in every technological field and estab-
lish global dominance. 
In fact, we already have evidence 
that they falsified emissions data be-
fore joining the Paris Agreement. But 
some still want to trust them? It 
doesn’t take a classified intel report to 
call China’s bluff. 
They have no intention of meeting 
these goals, but that won’t stop them 
from telling us that they are on track. 
If I had to guess, they will say they are 
doing it even better than we are in re-
ducing emissions, if for nothing more 
than their ongoing information warfare 
to make us appear weak and ineffec-
tual on the world stage. 
Madam Speaker, that is the purpose 
of my amendment. We need to have the 
State 
Department, 
in 
consultation 
with the Department of Energy, come 
in and give us the facts. This amend-
ment requires an annual briefing re-
garding the progress and efforts of 
China to meet emissions goals. 
We need to know: Is China telling the 
truth about how much they have re-
duced emissions? Are they building 
more coal-fired power plants? Have 
they successfully deployed carbon cap-
ture technologies the way we have? 
These are answers we need for the 
United States to compete with China. 
Knowledge is power and the quickest 
path to victory is understanding your 
adversary. Despite all the other prob-
lems scattered throughout this bill, I 
believe this amendment is a chance to 
at least do one thing right. 
This amendment is about account-
ability, this is about accuracy, and 
most importantly, this is about know-
ing the full capabilities of our largest 
and fiercest competitor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support accountability, to 
support accuracy, to support truth, and 
to support knowledge by supporting 
this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to amend-
ment 56 by Representative CRENSHAW. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO) is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H928 
February 3, 2022 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I believe the infor-
mation being solicited is important, al-
though I don’t think that we need to 
pass a law to get it, and we shouldn’t 
have to pass a law to get it. In that 
sense, I think the amendment is over-
kill. 
As chairman of the Oversight Sub-
committee on Foreign Affairs last Con-
gress, I saw how incredibly difficult it 
was to get basic information and sim-
ple briefings from the Trump adminis-
tration. So I am sympathetic to get-
ting information from an administra-
tion. 
The checks and balances put in place 
by the Constitution require the execu-
tive branch, no matter the party, to be 
responsive to congressional oversight. 
As we saw during the last administra-
tion, the executive branch has become 
increasingly empowered to not cooper-
ate with Congress on basic oversight 
matters; that much is true. 
The Foreign Affairs Committee has 
found statutorily mandated briefings, 
however, generally backfire. They give 
the executive branch an excuse not to 
provide basic briefings on important 
subject matters on which we do not 
mandate briefings through legislation. 
These topics vastly outnumber those 
with statutorily required briefings. By 
writing mandatory briefings into stat-
ute, Congress is conceding to the exec-
utive that it does not need to be re-
sponsive to legislative branch inquiries 
unless a statute says so. 
Although I am opposing this amend-
ment, I think the information is impor-
tant. I would also join Representative 
CRENSHAW in a letter requesting that 
kind of briefing from the Biden admin-
istration this year and the next and 
until the next administration. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support for the amendment pro-
posed by Representative CRENSHAW. 
Despite being the world’s leading 
emitter of carbon emissions and the 
second largest economy, China made 
minimal commitments under the Paris 
Agreement for greenhouse gas reduc-
tion, and we let them get away with it. 
Now we have heard claims from the 
CCP, this administration, as well oth-
ers, the CCP is stepping up their com-
mitments and generally want to ad-
dress climate change. In fact, China 
has only committed to stop increasing 
emissions by 2030. That is another 8 
years of increasing emissions from 
China. 
This administration’s wishful think-
ing ignores the fact that the United 
States is the only industrialized nation 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
over the last 2 years in a row, which 
has been achieved primarily with low- 
emissions natural gas from my home 
State of Pennsylvania. 
However, the reality of China’s new 
commitments is that they are still 
doing the bare minimum compared 
with what the United States and other 
leading economies have committed. 
China continues to use fuels that this 
administration is strongly throttling 
back. 
If we are expected to believe the CCP 
is genuine in their commitments on 
climate, then it is critical that we see 
proof and accountability. 
Madam Speaker, that is why I sup-
port this amendment to require annual 
briefings on the Peoples Republic of 
China’s progress toward their climate 
commitments. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, again, I agree this is 
important information. However, this 
should not be our approach, except on 
issues where the executive branch has 
continuously, and over a period of 
time, refused to respond to basic in-
quiries. 
On climate issues, the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee has not had any issues 
obtaining core information that is 
shared on a bipartisan basis. In fact, 
both Secretary of State Blinken and 
Special Envoy Kerry addressed this 
question in their hearings in front of 
our committee last year. 
Again, I would be willing to work 
with Representative CRENSHAW, and ev-
erybody else who is interested in a bi-
partisan way, to request this hearing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CRENSHAW). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now

printed in part D of House Report 117–

any other person demurrage or detention 
charges under a tariff, marine terminal 
schedule, service contract, or any other con-

an accurate certification that such charges 
comply with all rules and regulations con-
cerning demurrage or detention issued by 
the Commission. The certification require-
ment only applies to the entity that estab-
lishes the charge, and a common carrier or

shipment of empty containers while exclud-
ing, limiting, or otherwise reducing the ship-
ment of full, loaded containers when such

provision of law and not later than 30 days of 
the date of enactment of this subsection, a 
common carrier or marine terminal oper-
ator, shall— 
‘‘(1) act in a manner consistent with any 
rules or regulations concerning demurrage or

DETENTION 
CHARGES.—In the event of a finding that the 
certification under section 41102(e) was inac-

after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Federal Maritime Commission shall initiate

minal operators from adopting and applying 
unjust and unreasonable demurrage and de-
tention rules and practices. 
(2) CONTENTS.—The rulemaking under para-

in the final rule published on May 18, 2020, ti-
tled ‘‘Interpretive Rule on Demurrage and

tions for demurrage, detention, cargo avail-
ability for retrieval and associated free time, 
and other terminology used in the rule. The 
definition for cargo availability for retrieval 
shall account for government inspections.

tion rules are not independent revenue 
sources but incentivize efficiencies in the 
ocean transportation network, including the 
retrieval of cargo and return of equipment. 
(C) Prohibiting the consumption of free 
time or collection of demurrage and deten-
tion charges when obstacles to the cargo re-
trieval or return of equipment are within the 
scope of responsibility of the carrier or their 
agent and beyond the control of the invoiced 
or contracting party.

tinuation of free time unless cargo is avail-
able for retrieval and timely notice of cargo

available during the free time period. 
(F) Prohibiting the consumption of free 
time or collection of detention charges on 
containers when the marine terminal re-
quired for return is not open or available. 
(G) Requiring common carriers to provide 
timely notice of— 
(i) cargo availability after vessel dis-
charge; 
(ii) container return locations; and 
(iii) advance notice for container early re-
turn dates. 
(H) Establishing minimum billing require-
ments, including timeliness and supporting 
information that shall be included in or with 
invoices 
for 
demurrage 
and 
detention 
charges that will allow the invoiced party to 
validate the charges. 
(I) Requiring common carriers and marine 
terminal operators to establish reasonable 
dispute resolution policies and practices. 
(J) Establishing the responsibilities of 
shippers, receivers, and draymen with re-
spect to cargo retrieval and equipment re-
turn.

parties other than the shipper for any de-
murrage, detention, or other similar per con-
tainer 
charges, 
including 
determining 
whether such parties should be billed at all.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
GARAMENDI) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, my amendment No. 
89 is the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, 
H.R. 4996, which the House passed 
under suspension of the rules on De-
cember 8, 2021. 
I introduced this legislation with 
Congressman DUSTY JOHNSON of South 
Dakota last summer to provide the 
first major overhaul of the Federal 
rules for the global ocean shipping in-
dustry in nearly a quarter century. We 
did this because American exporters 
have a serious and, in some cases, an 
existential problem. 
Many exporters cannot get a con-
tainer to ship their goods. For those 
who can get a container, they cannot 
get it on a ship. 
Last Friday, a farmer in my district 
pleaded for help. His business depends 
upon exporting his crop. He had worked 
with the normal forwarding and ship-
ping companies to no avail. His words 
were: ‘‘I will be out of business. I will 
lose my market. Help me.’’ 
For months, I have heard similar 
words from the wine, almond, walnut, 
beef, and other industries. I know that 
my colleague, Congressman JOHNSON, 
has heard the same. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act is 
the solution to this problem. And the 
House has already acted, passing our 
bill by a strong bipartisan vote of 364 
yeas to 60 nays. 
All but two members of the House 
Democratic Caucus voted for our bill, 
and I am looking for them now to vote 
on this in a positive way. Seventy per-
cent of the Republican Conference also 
voted aye. 
In short, this is among the most bi-
partisan bills considered in the House 
this Congress, and it has the potential 
to get signed into law. 
Congressman JOHNSON and I are of-
fering our Ocean Shipping Reform Act 
as an amendment to the America COM-
PETES Act, the House counterpart to 
the U.S.-China competition bill passed 
by the Senate last summer. 
The world has changed greatly since 
Congress last reformed the Federal law 
governing the global ocean shipping in-
dustry. In late 2001, the People’s Re-
public of China was granted permanent 
normal trade relations with the United 
States, the so-called most-favored-na-
tion status, following that country’s 
admission to the WTO. The United 
States’ trade imbalance with the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China grew from ap-
proximately $83 billion in nominal dol-
lars in 2001 to a trade imbalance of over 
$310 billion in 2020, increasing nearly 
every year. 
Our bipartisan legislation in this 
amendment 
would 
better 
support 
American exporters by ensuring recip-
rocal trade to help reduce the United 
States’ longstanding trade imbalance 
with export-driven countries. 
There has also been considerable con-
solidation among the foreign-based 
ocean carriers, coinciding with the con-
tinued 
decline 
of 
the 
U.S.-flagged 
international fleet in favor of foreign 
flags of convenience. A handful of for-
eign-flagged ocean carriers now domi-
nate the global ocean shipping indus-
try. Many of these foreign-flagged car-
riers are effectively controlled by for-
eign governments: China, Taiwan, and 
South Korea. 
In 2021, as Americans endured monu-
mental port congestion and supply

chain problems, the largest foreign- 
flagged ocean carriers saw their profits 
more than triple over the previous 
year. Last year, the China Ocean Ship-
ping Company, COSCO, reported an-
nual profits nine times greater than 
the company’s earnings in the previous 
year. 
Madam Speaker, I am here today to 
say, once again, that foreign exporters’ 
access to the American market and our 
consumers is a privilege. It is not a 
right. 
American agricultural exporters and 
other businesses are willing to pay to 
ensure that their products reach the 
emerging market in the Asia-Pacific 
region. In turn, companies looking to 
off-load foreign-made products at West 
Coast ports must provide opportunities 
for American exports. 
In 2019, America exported more than 
$21.7 billion in agricultural products. 
Our farmers, ranchers, and producers 
in the Central Valley of California and 
throughout the State have worked for 
decades to unlock foreign export mar-
kets. That hard-won access to those 
valuable foreign markets, particularly 
in East Asia and the Indo-Pacific, is 
now threatened by the ocean carriers’ 
anticompetitive and likely illegal busi-
ness practices. 
Congress must ensure reciprocity in 
trade with other countries to reduce 
the American trade imbalance, par-
ticularly with cheap imports from 
Asia. Even during the pandemic, trade 
must be mutually beneficial, and that 
is exactly what the Ocean Shipping Re-
form Act would ensure. 
Dozens of agricultural exporters con-
tacted my office, as I have already 
said, and the outright refusal of Amer-
ican exports is not conscionable. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I claim the time in opposi-
tion, although I am not opposed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, this amendment would insert 
the text of H.R. 4996, the Ocean Ship-
ping Reform Act of 2021, into the Amer-
ica COMPETES Act. 
The bill passed the House under sus-
pension of the rules with 364 bipartisan 
votes in December, and I was proud to 
support the legislation. 
The amendment provides expanded 
authorities to the Federal Maritime 
Commission, which regulates ocean 
shipping to protect and ensure fairness 
for U.S. shippers who import and ex-
port items to and from the U.S. 
The amendment helps American ship-
pers operate on a level playing field by 
increasing protections for U.S. shippers 
from retaliation by foreign shippers 
who file a complaint with the FMC. 
It also prohibits foreign ocean car-
riers from unreasonably denying the 
carriage of U.S. export cargo on foreign 
ocean carriers’ vessels if such cargo is 
available, can be loaded safely, and is 
going to a destination on the ship’s 
schedule. 
This provision is important for agri-
cultural producers in Oklahoma and 
across the country who will benefit 
from increased capacity to ship produc-
tion across the globe. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Congressmen GARAMENDI and JOHNSON 
for their support of the underlying bill 
and this amendment, and I urge its 
passage. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from the Mount Rush-
more State of South Dakota (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. 
Madam Speaker, some have suggested 
that the supply chain crisis has eased. 
Now, to be sure, important progress 
has been made, but serious problems 
still exist, and now is not the time for 
us to take our foot off the gas. 
Notably, although this body has 
passed the Garamendi-Johnson Ocean 
Shipping Reform Act, the Senate has 
not yet acted. Let’s be clear: Action is 
needed. 
Earlier this week, the dry peas and 
lentils producers told me that 30 to 40 
percent of their shipments are still 
being canceled by the foreign-flagged 
ocean carriers. Now, remember, this is 
an environment where 60 percent of the 
containers that were hauled back to 
Asia last year went back empty. They 
were empty at a time when American 
agriculture products were aging and, in 
some cases, spoiling right there on the 
docks. 
Carriers are discriminating against 
American manufactured and agricul-
tural goods. 
This is not a conceptual threat. 
These practices have already cost the 
American dairy industry more than 
$1.3 billion, and things could get a lot 
worse. 
Our producers have worked hard to 
build foreign markets in the commod-
ities that Mr. GARAMENDI mentioned as 
well as beef, beans, corn, and dairy. If 
those producers cannot meet their obli-
gations, then buyers will look else-
where for food. This has already cost us 
an estimated 22 percent of market 
share for our ag producers. This is un-
acceptable. 
Now, Mr. GARAMENDI is right. A func-
tional market has reciprocity. It also 
has basic rules of the road, and the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act establishes 
those basic rules of the road. This 
amendment would add OSRA to the un-
derlying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the amendment so that we can con-
tinue to build momentum. 
Now, in fact, our partners in the Sen-
ate, AMY KLOBUCHAR and JOHN THUNE, 
are expected to introduce OSRA in 
their Chamber this week. Yet another 
House vote in support of OSRA will 
send a clear message to Leader SCHU-
MER that our bill should be put on the 
floor for a vote. 
Madam Speaker, we do need to better 
align the interests of the foreign- 
flagged ocean carriers with those of 
American manufacturers and American 
ag producers. That is what this amend-
ment does. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from California. 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 124 OFFERED BY MS. JAYAPAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 124 
printed in part D of House Report 117–

the America COMPETES Act section 
60501. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:

(D) An assessment of— 
(i) humanitarian impacts of U.S. and mul-
tilateral sanctions on entities and individ-
uals associated with the current government 
of Afghanistan and the freeze of $9.4 billion 
of the Afghan central bank’s foreign re-
serves, including projections regarding po-
tential mortality rate and refugee outflows; 
(ii) the impacts of existing United States 
and multilateral laws, regulations, and sanc-
tions on the influence of the People’s Repub-
lic of China in Afghanistan; and 
(iii) projected impacts on illicit finance ac-
tivity between the People’s Republic of 
China and affiliated entities in Afghanistan 
in connection with the finances of Afghani-
stan and the Taliban in the event of a col-
lapse of the licit Afghan banking system.

ian deaths and refugees, and the result-
ing effect on additional Chinese Gov-
ernment influence in Afghanistan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H933 
February 3, 2022 
Today’s New York Times published a 
harrowing front-page article headlined 
‘‘Over a Million Flee as Afghanistan’s 
Economy Collapses,’’ which reports 
that for millions already living hand to 
mouth, Western sanctions have led to 
life-threatening 
hunger 
across 
the 
country as incomes have dried up and 
humanitarian aid has been obstructed. 
After our withdrawal from Afghani-
stan, U.S. sanctions on the Taliban 
have impacted the broader functioning 
of the entire Afghan Government, in-
cluding schools and hospitals, which 
cannot buy food for patients or gas to 
heat their buildings. 
The New York Times reports that, 
according to aid organizations, starva-
tion could kill 1 million children this 
winter. These fatalities could far ex-
ceed civilian deaths resulting from 20 
years of war. 
The United States has frozen $9.4 bil-
lion of the Afghan central bank’s for-
eign reserves, making it impossible for 
the country’s financial system to func-
tion and threatening to collapse the 
entire economy. 
U.N. 
Secretary 
General 
Antonio 
Guterres has pleaded for ‘‘increased li-
quidity’’ to ‘‘free up frozen currency re-
serves and reengage Afghanistan’s cen-
tral bank’’ to ‘‘pull the economy back 
from the brink.’’ 
Former Republican South Carolina 
Governor David Beasley, now the head 
of the World Food Programme, simi-
larly said that unless those Afghan 
central bank funds are unfrozen, ‘‘this 
country will absolutely collapse.’’ 
A senior official at the International 
Red Cross pointedly asked: ‘‘Can the 
international community hold 39 mil-
lion people hostage to the fact that 
they do not want to recognize the au-
thorities that are now in place in 
Kabul and in Afghanistan?’’ 
If appeals from the world’s leading 
humanitarian and aid organizations on 
the devastating impacts of current U.S. 
policy do not persuade my colleagues, I 
ask them to consider whether Afghani-
stan’s economic crisis will pose an op-
portunity for neighboring China to ex-
pand its influence in the country. 
b 1315 
For those seeking to better under-
stand the Chinese Government’s influ-
ence in Afghanistan and the rise of il-
licit financial transactions in the coun-
try, my amendment would ensure that 
we have this information. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment, which simply requires ad-
ditional information on the impact of 
U.S. sanctions on Afghanistan’s migra-
tion, mortality, financial health, and 
influence from the Chinese Govern-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I claim time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 
this amendment. The amendment is 
the latest attempt by Progressives to 
undermine efforts to keep money out of 
the hands of a terrorist organization. 
Following the Biden administration’s 
disastrous withdrawal from Afghani-
stan and the Taliban’s takeover of the 
country, the U.S. did freeze nearly $9.5 
billion in assets of the Afghan central 
bank to prevent the terrorist organiza-
tion from accessing the funds. 
Other 
international 
organizations 
have 
taken 
similar 
actions. 
This 
amendment attacks such protections 
made by the U.S. and our international 
partners. The package already jeopard-
izes our national security by signaling 
to the Communist leadership in China 
that we are not taking our economic 
competitiveness 
and 
technological 
leadership seriously. 
Now, some of our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are taking it a 
step further by attempting to include 
language that encourages handing over 
billions of dollars to a terrorist organi-
zation. I am disappointed an amend-
ment that helps enrich the Taliban is 
being considered for inclusion in a so- 
called international competitiveness 
package. 
I encourage my colleagues to oppose 
the amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, we 
join the American people in telling the 
President that he did the right thing 
by finally ending this never-ending war 
in Afghanistan. 
However, we can’t abandon the coun-
try and its people. We have to make 
sure we get aid to the people of Afghan-
istan in the wake of our 20-year war 
there. 
In addition to the moral urgency of 
reevaluating a set of economic policies 
that threaten to harm untold Afghan 
civilians, including 1 million children, 
American 
policymakers 
deserve 
to 
have a complete and comprehensive 
picture of what is occurring in Afghan-
istan, 
including 
an 
honest 
under-
standing of our own actions, their 
human impacts, and their political and 
economic effects. 
We must not be afraid to connect the 
dots. Indeed, this is a pre-condition to 
changing U.S. policy when it contrib-
utes to outcomes that contradict our 
own interests and our own values. Any 
report on Afghanistan’s financial pic-
ture would be gravely incomplete with-
out also examining current U.S. poli-
cies. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, why this particular amend-
ment is being put into an America 
COMPETES Act is beyond me. It is 
emboldening and empowering our ad-
versaries across the world and, cer-
tainly, with this particular move, you 
are allowing for terrorist organizations 
to access $9.5 billion. 
While I recognize the humanitarian 
crisis, this administration is respon-
sible for that, candidly. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ant to House Resolution 900, the pre-

OKLAHOMA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now

printed in part D of House Report 117–

Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise as the designee of the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM), and I have an amendment at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 371, after line 6, insert the following: 
(y) NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION STUDY 
ON INFLATION.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 45 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Director shall commission a study to— 
(A) measure the economic impact of infla-
tion on the American people, including an 
analysis of cost-of-living impacts; 
(B) assess how the increase in inflation has 
harmed the American workforce through de-
creased, less valuable wages; 
(C) consider the impact of inflation on 
American 
international 
competitiveness, 
particularly as it relates to offshoring jobs 
in the manufacturing industry; 
(D) evaluate the impact of inflation on 
rural and underserved communities through-
out the country; 
(E) assess the ways inflation at its current 
trajectory could impact future American 
generations; and 
(F) make recommendations to Congress on 
the impact of further government spending 
in regards to inflation. 
(2) FUNDING.—Of the funds authorized to 
carry out this section, $1,000,000 shall be used 
to carry out the study under paragraph (1). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
strongly 
support 
this 
amendment, and I thank my fellow 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee member, Representative YOUNG 
KIM, for first authoring this policy. 
According to a recent Gallup Poll, 79 
percent of Americans expect inflation

to continue to rise over the next 6 
months. Inflation isn’t an abstract con-
cept. Americans across the country are 
feeling the pinch every day at the gro-
cery store, the gas pump, and every-
where else as they buy goods to support 
their families. 
The Consumer Price Index reported 
earlier this year that inflation soared 
to a record level of 7 percent in 2021, 
and it only continues to grow with 
Democrats’ wasteful spending sprees. 
The underlying bill we are consid-
ering today just continues that dan-
gerous pattern of reckless spending. In-
stead of focusing on the targeted bipar-
tisan investments in basic research 
that would help America excel in com-
petition against China, the underlying 
bill is filled with partisan slush fund 
spending. 
We need to address the inflation cri-
sis, and it should be top of mind when-
ever we consider massive spending 
bills. 
This is why I strongly support this 
amendment, which directs the National 
Science Foundation to commission a 
study on the impacts of inflation on 
the American people, our international 
competitiveness, our underserved and 
rural communities, and our future gen-
erations. 
As the U.S. economy rebounds from 
COVID–19, with the national debt at 
more than $30 trillion, and inflationary 
risks rising daily, this straightforward 
amendment is sensible, necessary, and 
timely. 
I want to thank my colleague for her 
work on this important amendment. I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the colleague’s 
concern about the impact of inflation 
on our constituents, especially those 
who are already living on the margins. 
If anything, this should be a wake-up 
call to us how far too many Americans 
are living on the margins. 
But I will not digress further. This 
amendment, while well-intentioned, I 
am sure, is misplaced. 
Without question, NSF funds impor-
tant economic research. In fact, they 
have funded nearly all recipients in the 
history of the Nobel Prize in econom-
ics. So, surely, there are NSF-funded 
economists who study some of these 
questions. 
However, this amendment is highly 
flawed. If the intent is for NSF to fund 
researchers through the traditional 
grant-making process, this amendment 
circumvents 
NSF’s 
gold 
standard 
merit-review process. In that process, 
the researchers themselves propose the 
important questions, which are then 
reviewed by their peers. 
If the intent, on the other hand, is for 
NSF to commission the National Acad-
emies or some other organization to 
carry out this study, the focus is en-
tirely inappropriate. 
NSF, and sometimes Congress, do 
call on the National Academies, or an-
other respected organization, to carry 
out studies on particular topics, but 
those studies are notable for some key 
criteria. 
First, they are not carrying out 
original research or data analysis. 
They are summarizing the current sci-
entific understanding, as published in 
the peer-reviewed literature. 
And second, they are providing rec-
ommendations that guide NSF’s own 
decisionmaking in what research topics 
are highest priority to advance to the 
frontiers of science, and the mecha-
nisms to facilitate that research. 
This study meets neither of those es-
sential criteria, not even close. Per-
haps the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
has some of these data already and can 
brief the gentlewoman. 
But this is simply inappropriate for 
the National Science Foundation, and I 
must oppose this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, in closing, I want to reiterate 
my thanks to Representative KIM for 
her work on the amendment. I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote to my colleagues, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

SEC. 
30613. 
WITHDRAWAL 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES FROM THE UNITED NATIONS 
FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLI-
MATE CHANGE. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The President shall— 
(1) not later than 5 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, provide written 
notification to the Depository of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, done at Rio de Janeiro, June 3-14, 
1992, of the withdrawal of the United States 
from the Convention effective on the date 
that is one year after the date of receipt by 
the Depository of such notification of with-
drawal in accordance with Article 25 of the 
Convention; and 
(2) on the effective date referred to in para-
graph (1), withdraw the United States from 
the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change. 
(b) LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS.—No funds 
authorized or appropriated by any Act may 
be used to support, directly or indirectly, 
any efforts on the part of any United States 
Government official to take steps to carry 
out the obligations of the United States 
under the United Nations Framework on Cli-
mate Change on or after the effective date 
referred to in subsection (a)(1).

ant to House Resolution 900, the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to please join me in pro-
tecting American workers by termi-
nating U.S. participation in the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Cli-
mate Change. The UNFCCC charges 
signatories to work to stabilize green-
house gas concentrations in the atmos-
phere at a level that will prevent dan-
gerous human interference with the 
climate system. 
The institution’s mission to prevent 
dangerous human interference with the 
climate system precludes the body 
from investigating potential natural 
causes of climate variation and binds 
member states to act in the interest of 
human safety even in the face of sci-
entific uncertainty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H935 
February 3, 2022 
Together, these provisions require 
treaty signers to take significant ac-
tions to curb their economic output 
without considering the scientific basis 
for such actions or the effect such ac-
tions will have on the environment. 
The Paris accords present a prime ex-
ample of the inefficacy of the UNFCCC 
framework. The accords received major 
domestic blowback given the deep GHG 
restrictions imposed on our Nation rel-
ative to the world’s major polluters; 
namely, China. Even if our GHG emis-
sions could be eliminated completely 
overnight, it would have no impact 
globally. 
None. 
Chinese 
emissions 
would make up the difference, and the 
result is the U.S. economy would be 
unnecessarily crippled, while the CCP’s 
economy would grow unencumbered. 
The UNFCCC further requires that 
industrialized nations support climate 
change action in developing countries 
on top of aid already provided to these 
countries. Developing countries like 
China; like if anybody here thinks they 
are still developing, well, I guess that 
is why you have been sending our jobs 
over there for 40 years. We are forced 
to pay for and bail them out. This 
amounts to the U.S. taxpayer paying 
for and bailing out Chinese green in-
dustries at the expense of U.S. jobs. We 
are tired of it. Put plainly, remaining 
party to a treaty requiring our Nation 
to fund the offshoring of manufac-
turing jobs, our very own jobs, should 
be met with contempt across this polit-
ical spectrum. 
Finally, the UNFCCC’s leadership has 
made clear that the treaty has nothing 
to do with environmental policy. It is, 
quite frankly, an effort to reshape the 
world’s economy to eliminate free and 
competitive 
markets. 
Former 
UNFCCC’s 
Executive 
Secretary 
Christiana Figueres stated as much. 
This is what she said: ‘‘This is the first 
time in the history of mankind that we 
are setting ourselves the task of inten-
tionally, within a defined period of 
time, to change the economic develop-
ment model that has been reigning for 
at least 150 years, since the industrial 
revolution.’’ Free markets. 
If the U.S. wants to impose signifi-
cant economic harm on its own citizens 
and overturn the free market economic 
system, it should be done under the 
constitutional system in this body, not 
by the dictates of the international 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
the amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CASTRO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose Mr. PERRY’s amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CASTRO. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania’s amend-
ment would undermine the U.S. leader-
ship on climate change and isolate the 
United States on the world stage on a 
critical issue for the future of our Na-
tion and the future of the world. 
Unfortunately, my Republican col-
leagues claim that they are deeply 
alarmed by China. They implore us to 
counter a threat from the People’s Re-
public of China, yet when a comprehen-
sive bill is in front of them to strength-
en the United States’ competitiveness 
on the world stage, including on our di-
plomacy, all of that urgency goes out 
the window. 
And why? Why aren’t Republicans 
clamoring to vote for America COM-
PETES Act? This amendment makes 
clear that it is at least in part because 
of their climate denialism. Republicans 
just don’t want to address climate in 
this China bill, even though China is 
the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases 
and is outcompeting us at the same 
time in creating the green energy jobs 
of the future. The truth is, they don’t 
want the United States to address cli-
mate change, period. 
Our closest allies were aghast when 
President Trump pulled us out of the 
Paris climate agreement, and China 
took advantage of that in every way 
that it could, painting the United 
States as the irresponsible party on the 
world stage. Now Mr. PERRY’s amend-
ment would have us make the same 
mistake again. 
If we want to hold China accountable 
for its coal power plants and its rising 
emissions, we need to be at the table to 
pressure it to do better, and we need to 
lead multilateral efforts to combat cli-
mate change and invest in green en-
ergy and green projects, because if we 
don’t, China will be more than happy 
to fill in with its unsustainable Belt 
and Road Initiative projects and its fi-
nancing, which always comes with 
strings attached. 
For those reasons and others, I op-
pose this amendment and ask my col-
leagues to do the same. 
I reserve the balance of my time, 
Madam Speaker. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL). 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, if we 
adopt the motion to recommit, we will 
instruct the Committee on Science to 
consider my amendment to ensure that 
this bill will not fund the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
I ask unanimous consent to include 
the text of my amendment in the 
RECORD immediately prior to the vote 
on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCCAUL. As I said yesterday, 
the generational threat of the Chinese 
Communist Party is a test, not only 
for our national security but for Amer-
ican values. Sadly, this bill fails that 
test. 
The CCP exploits our economy. They 
are building hypersonic weapons on the 
backbone of U.S. technology, and they 
are using American intellectual prop-
erty to further their genocide. 
A substantive bill to counter the CCP 
isn’t just a security issue. It is a moral 
issue. Yet, this bill takes no meaning-
ful steps to keep U.S. technology out of 
the hands of the CCP’s military. 
Even worse, my Democratic col-
leagues have refused safeguards that 
would stop this money from financing 
slave 
labor 
and 
genocide 
in 
the 
Xinjiang province. 
Madam Speaker, I, therefore, urge 
my colleagues to reconsider this Tro-
jan horse bill and to adopt my straight-
forward amendment. It would stop 
huge sums of U.S. taxpayer dollars 
from going to the Chinese Government, 
from funding their genocide. It would 
stop research funds in this bill from 
being used by entities like the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology. 
Madam Speaker, this is the test of 
our time. We must not help the CCP 
build the future of global energy on a 
foundation of slave labor and genocide. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to stand on the right side of 
history and to support my motion to 
recommit. 
Mr. CASTRO. Madam Speaker, re-
garding Mr. PERRY’s amendment, if the 
United States does not choose to lead 
on the issue of climate change, we 
can’t outcompete China or expect the 
world to join us in countering China’s 
policies. 
To compete, we must lead the world 
forward, and we must face reality and 
be willing to enact policies that deal 
with reality. This amendment is about 
taking America backward, and so I ask 
my colleagues to oppose it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I would 
just say to my friends on the other side 
of the aisle, stop obfuscating, stop 
sending our jobs overseas. Start real-
izing what we have done together in 
this Chamber to our citizens who want 
to work in their jobs in their country. 
This has done nothing but overseas 
our jobs, outsource our jobs. Let’s not 
continue that process. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ant to House Resolution 900, the pre-

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the beginning of 
Black History Month and highlight the 
contributions and impact of Black 
Americans in my community. 
When I was elected to Congress in 
2018, I became the first Black woman to 
represent the 14th District and the 
youngest Black woman in Congress. I 
am honored to hold a place in Illinois 
14th’s Black history alongside the 
trailblazers that came before me—like 
Batavia-native Charles Edward Hall, 
whose 35-year career at the Census Bu-
reau fundamentally changed our na-
tional understanding of Black commu-
nities; or Civil War veteran, Henry 
Beard, and his wife, Julia, who after es-
caping slavery, became the first Black 
residents of Sycamore in 1871; and Dr. 
Lloyd from Elgin, who revolutionized 
food, drug, and cosmetic preservation 
with the creation of a sterilization 
process. 
These are just a few of the Black Illi-
noisans who have made a mark on my 
community and our country, and I am 
very proud to honor them. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LARRY 
BRUCE YAWN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Georgia’s very own college football 
legend, Larry Bruce Yawn. 
Bruce was a native of Americus, 
Georgia, 
eventually 
moving 
to 
Statesboro in 1959 where he would 
graduate from Statesboro High School 
with a full scholarship to play for the 
University of Georgia’s football team. 
While playing for the University of 
Georgia, Bruce was inducted into the 
National Football Foundation College 
Hall of Fame, having played in the Cot-
ton Bowl, Liberty Bowl, and Sugar 
Bowl, and being a member of the All- 
Academic SEC Team. 
After graduating, Bruce went on to 
become the owner of the well-known 
and community-loved Snooky’s Res-
taurant in Statesboro until its closing 
in 2012. Bruce went on to manage the 
Willow Pond Senior Center for several 
years before retiring. His remaining 
years were spent with his wife, Carol, 
and his children, who I know miss him 
dearly. His love for his community, 
family, and friends is something we 
should all work to build in ourselves. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
having 
been 
a 
prominent member in his community 
and church, Bruce’s passing is felt by 
the entire community. My thoughts 
and prayers are with his family and all 
who knew him during this time. 
f 
AMERICA COMPETES ACT 
AMENDMENTS 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
discuss two amendments to the Amer-
ica COMPETES Act that were offered 
by me. 
The first amendment would direct 
relevant Federal agencies to identify 
U.S. allied countries that are key re-
search partners so that we can develop 
and implement security procedures 
safeguarding our research. 
When we lead with diplomacy and en-
sure 
our 
Nation’s 
scientists, 
busi-
nesses, and workers compete on a level 
playing field, the result is innovation, 
opportunity, and prosperity for Ameri-
cans and our allies alike. I thank Rep-
resentatives GALLAGHER, CHENEY, and 
CASTEN for joining with me on this bi-
partisan effort. 
Madam Speaker, my second amend-
ment dealt with the human rights cri-
sis 
in 
the 
Philippines. 
President 
Duterte’s so-called ‘‘war on drugs’’ has 
served as a pretext to conduct an esti-
mated 30,000 extrajudicial killings to 
unjustly detain, torture, repress, and 
assassinate labor activists and other 
dissidents, including a U.S. citizen, ac-
tivist Brandon Lee, who remains para-
lyzed from the chest down as a result 
of an assassination attempt. 
This amendment says that U.S. tax-
payer funds in the bill cannot go to 
Philippines’ police forces as long as 
basic human rights are flagrantly vio-
lated. It is a historic step forward. 
f 
LOSING THE RACE WITH CHINA 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
imagine you are an inventor with a 
new idea. You put a lot of time, effort, 
and money into everything it takes for 
your idea to become a reality. Finally, 
after all your hard work, you have a 
successful product. However, a foreign 
competitor copied your intellectual 
property, and your property is now 
worthless. 
This is a serious problem facing 
American investors, entrepreneurs, and 
businesses, and the Chinese Communist 
Party is typically the culprit behind 
intellectual property theft. It is totally 
wrong that this happens right under 
our government’s nose, but we haven’t 
done a daggum thing to stop the ex-
ploitation. 
House Democrats are putting on the 
floor a bogus China competition bill 
that does nothing to actually solve this 
problem. In fact, they even rejected 
several amendments that address the 
lack of intellectual property protec-
tions in their bill. 
My Trade Related Intellectual Prop-
erty Protection Act was among the 
amendments Democrats rejected. It 
would require Congress to approve the 
sharing of any intellectual property 
with the World Trade Organization 
member states, giving us a chance to 
make sure Americans’ hard work does 
not get stolen by the Communist Chi-
nese. 
By 
excluding 
my 
commonsense 
amendment, Democrats missed an op-
portunity to make their bill a legiti-
mate response to Communist China’s 
attacks on America’s brightest minds. 
Madam Speaker, we are in a race 
with China to be the world’s tech-
nology superpower and we are giving in 
to the Communist Chinese wishes. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise solemnly today, at the start of this 
new year, to draw attention to an ap-
palling national benchmark. This is 
Gun Violence Survivors Week, the time 
of year that gun deaths in America sur-
pass the number of gun deaths that 
most other countries will mourn at the 
end of the year, if at all. 
Madam Speaker, 2022 is barely under-
way, and yet, here we are. Exceptional 
in the most disastrous and yet unac-
ceptable way, already at a completely 
incomprehensible count of lives lost to 
the scourge of gun violence in the 
country. Gun violence leaves a mark 
on each individual and community it 
impacts, and it spares none of our con-
stituents and none of our fellow coun-
trymen and women. 
Madam Speaker, this week, I am 
thinking about the students and par-
ents back home in Michigan, in Oak-
land County, who can no longer distin-
guish between a practice exercise and 
an active shooter scenario in our 
schools. The threats have been per-
petual, and the violence has become 
too real for far too many. 
So we join in this House of Rep-
resentatives to commit to acting on 
gun safety legislation. For those who 
are not working for it, are working 
against it.

SHAWNEE WOMEN-OWNED 
BUSINESSES 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H945 
February 3, 2022 
the city of Shawnee for being named 
the ‘‘Number 1 City for Women-Owned 
Businesses in Oklahoma.’’ The data 
collected by Oklahoma Baptist Univer-
sity is reflective of the impressive and 
hardworking women in Oklahoma’s 
Fifth District. 
The 
percentage 
of 
women-owned 
businesses in Shawnee is almost twice 
the statewide average for cities in 
Oklahoma and 29.5 percent higher than 
the national average. In total, 49.4 per-
cent of all Shawnee Forward businesses 
are owned and operated by women. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rep-
resent such dynamic women who are an 
integral part of Oklahoma’s economy 
through creating jobs and enriching 
communities. Their contributions to 
the financial stability, growth, and in-
novation in the State of Oklahoma is 
invaluable. 
I am grateful for the city of Shawnee 
and Shawnee Forward for their suc-
cessful efforts in fostering a positive 
environment for women entrepreneurs 
to start and grow their businesses. This 
hub of leaders has ignited Oklahoma’s 
entrepreneurial 
spirit 
and 
will 
no 
doubt inspire young women and girls 
across our great State for generations 
to come. 
f 
A BLACK WOMAN ON THE 
SUPREME COURT 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
this morning at the National Prayer 
Breakfast, the outstanding speakers of 
President Joe Biden, Vice President 
Kamala Harris, and Bryan Stevenson 
combined together to say, Use your 
faith to make a difference. Let me ap-
plaud the President of the United 
States. 
And in this month of February, 
where 
we 
typically 
honor 
African 
Americans and the history of how they 
contributed to this Nation, the Presi-
dent announced that he would nomi-
nate to the United States Supreme 
Court an African-American woman, a 
Black woman. 
Since 1789, March 4, was when the Su-
preme Court first organized, there has 
never been one of the major elements 
of society—first, a woman, and then a 
Black woman, who, of course, in slav-
ery, suffered alongside of men and chil-
dren. Black women continued, in es-
sence, to be subordinate. Continuing as 
domestics, fighting in wars, supporting 
families, and intellectually some of the 
smartest geniuses around. They were 
in fact ready to be on the Supreme 
Court. 
They won’t have a ‘‘woke’’ agenda. 
There won’t be a question of whether 
they know a law book. Let me just say, 
it is time for a Black woman on the 
United States Supreme Court. Do it 
now. I thank the President. 
BIDEN’S IMMIGRATION POLICY 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
the Biden immigration policy has been 
well-documented. We have gone from 
about 20,000 people a month being let in 
the country to 90,000. 
Between 2019 and 2021, the number of 
people kicked out of the country has 
fallen over 80 percent. What will the re-
sult be? More people on welfare, more 
crime, 
more 
drugs—particularly 
fentanyl—more people untested for 
COVID. 
But there is something else—because 
apparently that doesn’t bother the 
Biden administration—they ought to 
think about: You appear weak. You 
may not care, but believe me, all nor-
mal people around the world, when 
they see we are not enforcing immigra-
tion laws, they say we have a weak 
President. And when countries like 
Russia or China and North Korea and 
Iran size up the United States, they 
look at your border policy and say, we 
are dealing with a weak person. 
And all these decisions, which are 
very difficult decisions to be made with 
all these countries, are going to be that 
much more difficult to make because 
you, Mr. President, are defining weak-
ness in your immigration policy. That 
is the price that you will pay. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair and not to a per-
ceived viewing audience. 
f 
ADJOURNMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(b) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the House stands adjourned 
until 9 a.m. tomorrow. 
Thereupon (at 7 o’clock and 42 min-
utes p.m.), under its previous order, the 
House adjourned until tomorrow, Fri-
day, February 4, 2022, at 9 a.m.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
SYRIA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
earlier 
this 
morning, 
Americans 
learned that, thanks to the skill and 
bravery of our Armed Forces, we have 
taken off the battlefield the world 
leader of ISIS. I want to thank the in-
credible work of our brave military 
servicemembers who work day and 
night to keep Americans safe. So many 
have suffered at the brutal hand of 
ISIS. 
Senators will learn more about the 
operation later this morning during 
our classified, all-Senators briefing 
with Secretary Austin and other senior 
administration officials. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, on USICA and the 
America COMPETES Act, in the first 
year under President Biden and the 
Senate Democratic majority, America 
saw its strongest economic growth in 
decades, including increases in wages— 
very, very important to the American 
people, who have not seen enough of 
that over the last two decades. 
This week, Congress is taking a 
major step to build on that success by 
advancing legislation that will help 
lower costs, relieve U.S. supply chains, 
and bring manufacturing back to the 
United States. 
Over the next 2 days, the House will 
debate and vote to pass a companion 
bill to the Senate’s U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act, which we ap-
proved last summer, of course, with 
strong bipartisan support. I am pleased 
the House is taking this important 
step. 
I have been pushing for months for 
progress 
on 
this 
legislation 
to 
strengthen supply chains and boost our 
technological 
competitiveness. 
Sen-
ators from both sides of the aisle want 
to see a competition and technology 
bill finally enacted. After this week, we 
will hopefully be one step closer to 
achieving that goal. 
Americans are demanding bold solu-
tions to help lower the cost of living, 
and businesses from coast to coast need 
help to relieve supply chains strained 
by the pandemic. Legislation along the 
lines of USICA is just what the doctor 
ordered. It would provide the long-term 
help our country needs to lower costs 
and help businesses grow right here at 
home—jobs here in America, not over-
seas. 
One of the best examples of why this 
bill is needed is our Nation’s dangerous 
chip shortage. The shortage has sent 
shock 
waves 
across 
the 
economy,

hamstringing the production of every-
thing from cars, cell phones, refrig-
erators, medical devices, and equip-
ment used by our military. It has in-
creased the cost of all of those items, 
and American families are paying for 
those costs. 
USICA would help relieve them and 
make sure these supply chain bottle-
necks are relieved. Our proposal would 
provide $52 billion to help relieve those 
supply chain pressures and bring pro-
duction back to America. Instead of re-
lying on other countries for our chips, 
let’s bring these jobs back home. 
Typically, it is America that pro-
vides the research, the R&D in cutting- 
edge chips, but somehow this country 
has allowed them all to be made—or 
the vast majority of them to be made 
overseas. Let’s make them here with 
good manufacturing jobs, in addition 
to making sure we stay at the top of 
the game in terms of research. USICA 
does 
both—increases 
R&D 
and 
in-
creases manufacturing jobs—all here in 
America. 
So I want to commend my colleagues 
for pushing this legislation forward. Of 
course, we will have much more work 
to do to bridge our two proposals to-
gether, but the House’s vote this week 
sets us on a necessary course to passing 
these policies into law. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION 
Madam President, on SCOTUS, yes-
terday, I met with President Biden at 
the White House to discuss a broad 
range of issues on the Democratic 
agenda. One of the most important 
matters we covered was his intention 
to nominate the first Black woman 
Justice to the Supreme Court. I reiter-
ated the same commitment I have 
made all week: When President Biden 
makes his nominee known to the Na-
tion, I will move to have the Senate 
consider and confirm her as soon as 
possible. 
I will see to it that the process is 
fair, that Members on both sides of the 
aisle can evaluate questions and get to 
know the nominee, but we will also 
move quickly. Everything seems to be 
on track to get that done, to move the 
nominee quickly through the Congress. 
President Biden is not expected to 
announce his nominee for a few weeks, 
but we already know one thing: The 
President’s pledge to name a Black 
woman to the Supreme Court is his-
toric. There have been 115 Justices who 
have sat on the Court since 1789. Only 
five of them have ever been women— 
none until 1981. Only two have been Af-
rican American. But never, never has 
there 
been 
an 
African-American 
woman, who still make up a bare 6 per-
cent of the Federal judiciary. And— 
amazing—until 
1981, 
this 
powerful 
body, the Supreme Court, was almost 
all 
White 
men. 
Imagine. 
America 
wasn’t all White men in 1981—or ever. 
Under President Biden and this Sen-
ate majority, we are taking historic 
steps to make the courts look more 
like the country they serve by con-
firming highly qualified, diverse nomi-
nees. A quarter—a quarter—of all Afri-
can-American women who sit on the 
Federal bench were nominated by this 
administration and approved by this 
Senate. 
Just hear that. Twenty-five percent 
of African-American women who sit on 
the Federal bench came through the 
Senate this year. That is the progress 
we have made in a relatively short 
amount of time. 
In fact, nearly 70 percent of all the 
President’s nominees have been non- 
White, dwarfing the record of every 
single President since at least Jimmy 
Carter. 
Some say: Well, why is that? Because 
the Bench has been almost all White; 
as I said, 100 percent all White males 
until 1981. We have some ground to 
make up so the courts can represent 
America. 
These aren’t abstract facts and fig-
ures; who we put on the bench matters. 
The personal experience that each 
judge brings to bear cannot be merely 
glanced over. When Americans come 
before the courts and look up at those 
who preside in the courtroom, they 
should trust that those who render 
judgment on them will be able to un-
derstand each litigant’s lived experi-
ence and bring a modicum of human 
understanding required to apply the 
law equitably. The best way—the best 
way—we can do that is to elevate 
judges from a broad range of back-
grounds. Diversity, in all its forms, 
matters. It is good for the justice sys-
tem, and it is really vital to the health 
of our democracy. 
President Biden’s nominees are also 
extremely well qualified. We are not 
sacrificing qualifications and excel-
lence for diversity. President Biden’s 
nominees are both more diverse and 
more qualified than any President’s in 
recent history. I am proud of the ac-
complishments we have secured this 
past year to bring balance to our Fed-
eral courts. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, now on noms 
progress, yesterday was a good day on 
the Senate floor. We held 12 rollcall 
votes—yep, 12 rollcall votes—on a num-
ber of President Biden’s nominees to 
his administration and to the Federal 
bench. Half of these votes took place in 
the evening. I am glad we dispensed 
with them efficiently and without 
needless delay. I want to thank all my 
colleagues for their cooperation and 
flexibility as we moved through the 
large number of votes. 
We want to be able to keep doing 
this. We want to be able to work with 
similar speed next time a large number 
of votes are lined up on the floor. 
Maybe some of them, like last night, 
will go by voice. Some of these, there is 
no reason to have a vote on, except a 
few—just a handful; not the vast ma-
jority of the other party—insist we 
have votes on all of them, which only 
lengthens the process but doesn’t deter 
us from moving forward on these nomi-
nees. 
Of the 20 nominees I filed at the end 
of the last work period, we have con-
firmed or invoked cloture on all but 3 
of them, and today, we expect to hold 
cloture votes on the other 3. 
Again, it is an unusually large num-
ber of rollcall votes for nominees who 
typically pass with unanimous consent. 
Obstruction from a small group of Re-
publicans—only a small group; not the 
majority; not close to the majority— 
has forced us to work through these in-
dividuals one by one. But last night, 
with the cooperation of everybody, we 
were able to move quickly. So I thank 
my colleagues for their good work and 
cooperation. 
BANNING OF BOOKS 
Madam President, finally, once again 
on book banning, I want to return to 
the point I made yesterday about the 
wave of book bannings we are seeing in 
our public libraries and in our school 
districts across the country. 
We shouldn’t kid ourselves about the 
scary nature of these Orwellian attacks 
from the far right because when far- 
right legislators in places like Texas 
demand their schools turn over their 
reading lists or when a school district 
in Tennessee bans a graphic novel that 
teaches about the Holocaust or when 
reactionary voices hide behind claims 
of indecency or offensiveness anytime 
they attack works that explore issues 
of racism or identity or social injus-
tice, then we are not seeing free expres-
sion; we are seeing intimidation. 
That is what book bannings are 
about. They are efforts to intimidate 
educators and students away from ex-
ploring difficult issues, to obscure 
parts of our history the far right 
doesn’t like, and to perpetuate and 
even champion ignorance of our own 
past. We don’t need to look very far in 
history to see what happens when we 
go down the dangerous road of censor-
ship and suppression. When free expres-
sion is weakened, the mob is empow-
ered. 
These unprecedented efforts by the 
far right to ban books that explore in-
justice and racism are deeply dis-
turbing and nakedly Orwellian. They 
should be opposed at the State level be-
fore more damage is done to our stu-
dents and to our country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

nized.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S505 
February 3, 2022 
is examining three of President Biden’s 
nominees to the Federal Reserve Board 
of Governors. 
The Fed is one of the most con-
sequential institutions in America. Its 
decisions have massive ramifications 
for our citizens and for the world econ-
omy. 
At the same time, since its independ-
ence is paramount, the Fed’s structure 
insulates the Governors from short- 
term influence and political pressure. 
When an institution this important is 
this independent, the guardrails that 
confine its power are extremely impor-
tant. 
Now, Congress has given the Fed a 
statutory mandate that is really very 
clear and very limited. The Fed’s dual 
mandate is maximizing employment 
and stabilizing prices. That is it. That 
is what the Fed exists to do. 
The Fed is meant to serve as our cen-
tral bank. It is not meant to act as an 
unelected superlegislature that dabbles 
in 
broader 
economic 
policymaking 
should it strike its fancy. 
Its current leader, Chairman Powell, 
understands this keenly. But, unfortu-
nately, President Biden’s nominee for 
the powerful No. 2 slot wants to de-
stroy this crucial distinction. 
Less than 2 years ago, Sarah Bloom 
Raskin launched a PR campaign saying 
the unelected Fed Governors should 
pursue 
liberal 
environmental 
goals 
that elected Democrats cannot get 
through Congress through the banking 
system. 
That 
bears 
repeating. 
President 
Biden’s nominee for Fed Vice Chair 
wants unelected bureaucrats to finan-
cially bully the private sector into pol-
icy changes which lack enough support 
to become law the honest way. 
So let’s get more specific. Ms. Raskin 
has argued repeatedly in print that the 
Fed should ideologically pick winners 
and losers in the energy sector. 
In 2020, she said unelected bureau-
crats should have excluded companies 
that employ Americans and produce 
American energy from widely available 
rescue loans because oil and gas are 
not green enough for liberals’ liking. 
Now, this is the same old Democratic 
war on fossil fuels and middle America 
being smuggled into a dangerous new 
forum. 
Washington Democrats want to raise 
Americans’ gas prices. They want to 
make electricity even less affordable. 
They want it to cost more to keep your 
family warm in the dead of winter. And 
now they want to do all this in a rad-
ical new fashion where voters could 
never hold them accountable. 
The stated justification for this 
power grab is that climate change may 
impact the future of our economy; so 
therefore, it is the Fed’s business— 
what nonsense with no limiting prin-
ciple. Every major policy could affect 
our economy. Opening this Pandora’s 
box would transform the Fed from an 
apolitical 
central 
bank 
into 
a 
hyperpolitical 
superlegislature. 
It 
would turn the venerable institution 
that is supposed to safeguard the 
American dollar into enforcers for a 
radical agenda that can’t make it 
through Congress. 
So you had better believe liberal ac-
tivists are already acknowledging this 
would not stop with climate issues. 
They have got a whole list of ideolog-
ical goals they would like the Fed to 
literally force on our country. 
A year and a half ago, Democrats in-
troduced legislation that would assign 
the Fed the mission of racial redis-
tribution. They want to hardwire a 
kind of financial affirmative action 
plan into our banking system. 
Look, the American people don’t 
want these wild ideas. So their elected 
Representatives actually don’t support 
them. Now the far left wants to trans-
plant these radical campaigns out of 
Congress and into our central bank, 
where American voters don’t get a say. 
This is just another example of today’s 
Democratic Party’s refusing to work 
within the basic rules and institutions 
and, instead, trying to steamroll the 
guardrails to get their way. 
Ms. Raskin’s crusade would hurt 
working families, kill American jobs, 
make our Nation less independent, and 
cripple the Fed’s independence in the 
process. She wouldn’t even need her 
colleagues’ votes to do this damage. 
The Vice Chair for Supervision has sig-
nificant unilateral powers. She might 
be able to do this all by herself. 
Here is the bottom line: Working 
families can’t afford a nominee who is 
dying to jack up their bills and gas 
prices. Kentuckians and middle Ameri-
cans can’t afford a central banker who 
wants to bankrupt our industries and 
kill our jobs. 
The global economy can’t afford for 
the Fed to become a partisan battle-
field, and the American people will not 
accept their central bank acting like 
some 
woke—woke—superlegislature 
where citizens get no say. 
IRAN 
Madam President, now, on an en-
tirely different matter, this week, two 
of America’s closest partners in the 
Middle East made history. 
The UAE welcomed a President of 
Israel for the first time, laying another 
diplomatic stone on the foundation of 
the Abraham Accords. But within mere 
hours of President Herzog’s historic ar-
rival, we were reminded of the dangers 
that an increasingly violent Iran is 
willing to impose on anybody who pur-
sues peace. 
For a third straight week, the UAE 
was targeted by a Houthi missile at-
tack—of 
course, 
made 
possible 
by 
Tehran. Last week, the terrorists tar-
geted an airbase that hosts 2,000 U.S. 
personnel, and it was American-made 
missile defense systems that inter-
cepted the strike. 
The United States faces these same 
Iranian-backed threats, alongside part-
ners like Israel and the UAE, but you 
wouldn’t know it—you wouldn’t know 
it—by looking at President Biden’s for-
eign policy. 
A year ago, the State Department re-
moved Yemen’s Houthi terrorists from 
its list of foreign terrorist organiza-
tions. Since then, the Iranian proxy 
terrorists have only increased their at-
tacks, underwritten by Iranian money 
and technology—so much so, in fact, 
that, last month, the Biden adminis-
tration was reportedly considering re-
versing its decision. 
Iran’s strategy is to use violence to 
drive the United States out of the Mid-
dle East—small wonder they would 
double down on this strategy after the 
administration’s humiliating retreat 
from Afghanistan—and the failure to 
respond forcefully to Iranian-backed 
attacks against U.S. troops in the re-
gion has eroded our deterrence and dra-
matically increased the risk to U.S. 
personnel. 
If this administration chooses to 
shrug or look the other way when ter-
rorists target our friends and our inter-
ests and if they continue to withhold 
military capabilities from partners 
threatened by Iran, then they should 
not pretend to be surprised when tradi-
tional American partners in the Middle 
East start looking to Moscow and to 
Beijing to fill the vacuum. 
Of course, the biggest distraction 
keeping this administration’s atten-
tion from protecting our interests in 
the Middle East has been its ongoing 
obsession with returning to the Obama 
administration’s failed 2015 nuclear 
agreement. 
Since President Biden took office, he 
has made rejoining the deal an over-
riding diplomatic objective, but by 
blaming their predecessor’s ‘‘maximum 
pressure’’ approach and demonstrating 
an unwillingness to respond forcefully 
to Iranian-backed terrorist attacks, 
the 
administration 
has 
effectively 
taken the threat of sanctions or mili-
tary action literally off the table, 
neutering their own diplomacy right at 
the outset. So it is no wonder the hard- 
liners in Tehran are holding out for 
more concessions from the soft-liners 
in Washington. 
Now, look. It is not just Republicans 
who are concerned. Senator MENENDEZ 
recently expressed similar concerns on 
the Senate floor and called upon the 
Biden administration and our partners 
to ‘‘exert more pressure on Iran to 
counter its nuclear program, its mis-
sile program, and its dangerous behav-
ior around the Middle East, including 
attacks on American personnel and as-
sets.’’ 
Recent 
reports 
suggest 
some 
of 
Biden’s own diplomats also share these 
concerns and have literally withdrawn 
from the team over concerns the ad-
ministration’s top negotiator is taking 
too soft a line on Tehran. 
So, a year ago, Republicans made it 
clear to President Biden that, if his ad-
ministration were interested in having 
a bipartisan foreign policy, they would 
find willing partners here in the Sen-
ate. 
For my part, I recommended the 
President focus on securing bipartisan

support for promises and threats so 
they could endure beyond his term in 
office. I urged him not to let the for-
eign policy of the most powerful Na-
tion on Earth be reduced to an Etch A 
Sketch, starting from scratch every 4 
years. 
We don’t often agree, but I was grate-
ful to hear Chairman MENENDEZ concur 
this week that the ‘‘best guarantee of a 
sustainable, 
diplomatic 
agreement 
with Iran and the international com-
munity is to build one that garners bi-
partisan political support.’’ 
So look. I am still hopeful that Presi-
dent Biden will finally recognize how 
uninterested Tehran is in negotiating 
in good faith. It is certainly not too 
late to start heeding good advice. It is 
not too late to start ratcheting up the 
pressure on Tehran and imposing seri-
ous costs when its proxies dare to chal-
lenge the United States. It is not too 
late to try to craft a bipartisan ap-
proach to the Middle East. It is not too 
late to have a plan to contest Russian 
and Chinese influence in the Middle 
East. It is not too late to start nur-
turing the historic Abraham Accords 
and reassuring partners like Israel and 
the UAE that their engagement is 
backed by a rock-solid U.S. commit-
ment. 
A year ago, I said Iran was the big-
gest threat America and its partners 
faced in the Middle East. Unfortu-
nately, a year of Biden administration 
foreign policy has made that even more 
true. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
complete my remarks. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise 
today to speak on a topic of global im-
portance and mounting urgency, and 
that is Russia’s continued aggression 
toward Ukraine. 
After months of shifting tens of thou-
sands of troops and military equip-
ment, some from its easternmost mili-
tary district, Russia has built up a 
military presence around the northern, 
eastern, 
and 
southern 
flanks 
of 
Ukraine. 
Russia has also amassed 
forces in Belarus under the guise of 
joint military exercises. 
Unfortunately, there are no indica-
tions that the situation with Ukraine 
and Russia has taken any steps toward 
deescalation. If anything, Ukraine and 
our European partners are beginning to 
accept the U.S. assessment that Rus-
sia’s buildup is continuing on a trend 
to permit a well-resourced and sup-
ported attack in mid- to late February. 
As the cost of his deployment adds up 
and the so-called exercises in Belarus 
come to an end on February 20, Vladi-
mir Putin will reach a decision point. I 
say this not to provoke alarm but to 
emphasize that the United States and 
our security partners must do what we 
can while we can. It is critical to dem-
onstrate that there will be a unified re-
sponse from the West, including when 
it comes to sanctions and providing 
military equipment to Ukraine, so that 
we send the message to Putin that an 
attack would be a severe miscalcula-
tion on his part. 
Is an attack from Russia truly immi-
nent? 
Well, so far, Putin’s demands are 
nonstarters. 
Russia 
demanded 
that 
NATO deny Ukraine or any other free 
nation in Eastern Europe the ability to 
join this defensive alliance. Russia also 
demanded that NATO revert to its 1997 
posture and capabilities. 
These aren’t serious demands, and 
the administration rightly rejected 
both. Unfortunately, at this point, 
Putin would likely find it humiliating 
to back down from such a costly mili-
tary buildup without getting any con-
cessions from the West. Many fear that 
he has backed himself into a corner 
where he may feel like his best option 
is to attack, as disastrous as that 
would be. 
Now, the Ukrainians will say: How 
can Russia start a war with Ukraine? 
We have been at war for 8 years. 
That is a critical point to remember, 
particularly when Vladimir Putin and 
Russian 
Foreign 
Minister 
Sergey 
Lavrov are accusing the United States 
and NATO of stoking tensions and as-
suming a threatening military posture. 
Think about it: Russia has illegally 
occupied Crimea and backed separatist 
forces in the Donbas region of eastern 
Ukraine for 8 years as of this month. 
Yet Russia has the temerity to call 
NATO, which is a defensive alliance, 
and Ukraine—a free country that wish-
es to join that defensive pact—the ag-
gressors. I should add that this is not a 
case of NATO’s moving east, as the 
Russians will claim, but of independent 
countries seeking, of their own voli-
tion, to cast off old, imperialist Soviet 
influence and align with the West. 
Make no mistake about it. Russia is 
the aggressor here, and we know that 
Putin wants to destabilize an inde-
pendent Ukraine and bring it back into 
Russia’s sphere of influence, similar to 
what he has done with Belarus, and 
that includes making it unthinkable 
for Ukraine, Georgia, or any other na-
tion to seek or join NATO. 
There are many possible scenarios for 
a Russian attack, including an attempt 
by Russia to try to solidify control of 
eastern Ukraine, pick up territory 
along the coast, or connect a land 
bridge to Crimea. Any Russian attack 
would also surely include cyber and in-
formation operations—behavior which 
we have already seen. Russia could 
overwhelm 
Ukrainian 
defenses 
and 
strike command, control, and commu-
nications centers in an opening salvo 
before crossing the border, but its long- 
term course of action remains less cer-
tain. 
Ukrainians of all ages are showing 
their renewed willingness to put up a 
fight and to determine their own fu-
ture, and Putin has to weigh any pos-
sible gains against the risk of high cas-
ualties or an insurgency. 
Putin could also threaten Kyiv and 
try to force concessions elsewhere, but 
his calculus must already include the 
likely response of crippling sanctions 
and isolation, not to mention driving 
other nations like Sweden and Finland 
to align more closely with NATO. 
There have also been reports that 
Putin, whether by military attack or 
his little green men, could seek to 
overthrow President Zelenskyy. Russia 
has, of course, denied the claim, but 
Putin would certainly prefer a puppet 
regime to that of President Zelenskyy. 
The uncertainty surrounding what 
Putin could do does not lower the 
threat of a Russian attack on Ukraine. 
And the latest indicators suggest Rus-
sia is still pressing forward to prepare 
for an imminent attack. Reports show 
that Russia is moving blood supplies, 
medical materials, and more fuel tank-
ers to its west and to Belarus. Blood 
supplies are especially not required for 
a so-called exercise with Belarus; they 
are meant for casualties. 
We need to take these developments 
seriously, pursuing a diplomatic dees-
calation, while making sure Ukraine 
can put up a fight and that NATO is 
ready and able to defend against any 
direct Russian aggressions. 
On the diplomatic side, the United 
States and Russia have traded negotia-
tion letters. As I noted earlier, Vladi-
mir Putin is demanding a ransom for 
Ukraine’s safety—a permanent ban on 
Ukraine’s inclusion in NATO—and de-
manding that NATO, a freely associ-
ating defensive alliance, take steps to 
weaken its own security. These aren’t 
serious demands. 
So with no resolution in sight, the 
United States and its allies continue to 
move security assistance to Ukraine, 
including ammunition, missiles, and 
rockets, while preparing to reinforce 
NATO troops in border states. 
The Javelins and Stingers the West is 
sending Ukraine may do little to stop 
Russian long-range fires or airstrikes, 
but they could still impose a signifi-
cant cost if Russia tries to hold signifi-
cant territory, especially in urban 
areas. Ukrainians are prepared to put 
up a fight, and we should provide them 
with the arms that they need to dig in. 
I hope the administration and the 
majority party will take this threat to 
Ukraine seriously, utilize any remain-
ing levers of American influence to 
deter a renewed attack, and, if Putin 
proceeds, make him immediately real-
ize that it was a miscalculation. 
This will take coordinated, lethal 
military assistance and strong sanc-
tions, 
including 
against 
the 
Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. 
It will be critical that Democrats 
come to realize that Nord Stream 2 is 
one of Putin’s top geopolitical prior-
ities. When this administration waived 
sanctions on the pipeline, despite the 
overwhelming opinion that the pipeline 
will make Europe more reliant on—and

vulnerable to—Russian energy and will 
be an economic blow to Ukraine, Putin 
saw that he wouldn’t be challenged. 
This is a crisis of Putin’s making, 
but we didn’t get here overnight. 
Waiving sanctions in Nord Stream 2 is 
one of the many missed opportunities 
to signal strength against Putin. We 
first saw Russia amassing troops on 
Ukraine’s border last April. Yet here 
we are, roughly 10 months later, scram-
bling to deliver lethal defensive mili-
tary aid. 
The Biden administration has been 
too slow to respond to the mounting 
crisis and is now playing catchup. Ex-
hibit A is that the administration just 
this Monday named its pick to serve as 
Ambassador to Ukraine. Of all the 
times to have a top diplomat in a coun-
try to prove that we are taking its sit-
uation seriously and to coordinate as-
sistance, this is it. This follows a year 
of the administration slow-rolling as-
sistance to Ukraine and seemingly 
springing to action only after the 
United Kingdom and others began 
overtly equipping Ukraine. 
It is essential that we present a cred-
ible threat to Putin, but, unfortu-
nately, I think he has pegged our Presi-
dent as a benign counterpart. Putin 
can look at America and see an un-
popular President as risk-averse and 
spinning his wheels on a polarizing and 
flailing domestic agenda, not to men-
tion that he can look at President 
Biden’s botched withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan and the risk to our defense 
modernization efforts from another 
continuing resolution and conclude 
that Democrats and the President pose 
little threat to Russia’s ambitions. 
Given the Biden administration’s 
record, I have concerns about the 
President’s willingness to stand up to 
Russia, but I very much hope these 
concerns are unfounded. We simply 
cannot afford to fail in this situation. 
This is Ukraine’s fight, but the impli-
cations of an attack will go far beyond 
its borders. We cannot accept that one 
nation can simply attack and sub-
jugate another. And we cannot be so 
naive to think that Russia would stop 
with an invasion of Ukraine. The bear 
would still be in the woods, and Putin 
would love nothing more than to chal-
lenge or break the credibility of NATO 
or the United States. We cannot accept 
that scenario or allow Russia to dic-
tate our own security posture with re-
spect to NATO. 
The only way to reject that future is 
by standing with our partners and star-
ing down Putin’s open aggression. 
Shoring up our NATO presence and 
putting troops on high alert are steps 
in the right direction. I am sure 
Ukraine currently feels surrounded and 
outgunned, but we need to make clear 
to Ukraine and to Vladimir Putin that 
Ukraine is not alone; that the free na-
tions of the West will stand with 
Ukraine against Russian aggression 
and that the United States will make 
good on its NATO commitments. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
NOMINATION OF LEONARD PHILIP STARK 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we just 
had a vote, and the vote—Mr. Presi-
dent, would you mind repeating the 
margin on that vote. Do you have that 
handy? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty- 
four to thirty-three. 
Mr. CARPER. Fifty-four to thirty- 
three. In baseball, we are hoping there 
is going to be a settlement in the base-
ball dispute right now between labor 
and management. But, in baseball, you 
have some games that go extra innings, 
but at the end of the game, somebody 
wins and somebody loses. I like to say 
the team that wins gets a ‘‘w.’’ 
Well, we just had a ‘‘w’’ in favor of, 
in support of, the nomination of Leon-
ard Stark to serve on the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit—not 
just a win for him, for his family; not 
just a win for Delaware, where he is 
from; not just a win for the colleges 
and universities he has gone to, the 
places that he has worked, that he has 
practiced law, served as a judge; but 
this is a win for our country. This is a 
win for our country. I am honored 
today to rise in support of his nomina-
tion to serve on the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals. 
The Presiding Officer from time to 
time will see me on the floor passing 
out what we call palm cards—he has 
probably passed out a few of his own— 
to our colleagues asking them to join 
him—join me—in cosponsoring legisla-
tion, 
supporting 
amendments, 
sup-
porting bills on the floor. 
For the last day or two, I have been 
passing out palm cards to our Repub-
lican colleagues, asking them to sup-
port the nomination of Leonard Stark 
to serve on this court. As grateful as I 
am for all the Democrats and at least 
one or two Independents who voted for 
him, I want to also express my 
thanks—our thanks—to the Repub-
licans who crossed the aisle and saw fit 
to support his nomination. 
I am not sure how much our col-
leagues here in the Senate know about 
the U.S. Court of Appeals. I would be 
the first to admit that I had to do some 
homework on it myself. But this court 
is best known—may be best known for 
its decisions on patent law. That is 
right—patent law. In fact, it is the 
only appellate court, I am told, other 
than the U.S. Supreme Court that will 
hear and consider patent case appeals. 
But despite my needing to do a little 
homework on the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Federal Circuit, I do know a 
great deal about Judge Leonard Stark. 
In fact, I have known him for probably 
half of his life—for half of his life. I 
have admired him for every one of 
those years. 
He has been nominated by our Presi-
dent to serve in this critical role in 
this important court. I have had the 
chance to follow his nomination, along 
with 
Senator 
COONS
of 
Delaware, 
through the Judiciary Committee proc-
ess, and I am confident that Judge 
Stark’s judicial experience and his ex-
pertise, particularly—particularly—in

February 3, 2022 
the complex legal arena of patent law, 
make him a perfect fit—a perfect fit— 
for this particular judgeship. 
I know a lot about Judge Stark for a 
couple of reasons. One, we are from 
Delaware. Delaware is a little State. I 
like to say—people ask me some-
times—we have a million people who 
live there. They say: Have you met ev-
erybody in the State of Delaware? 
Probably not every one of them, but I 
met Judge Stark early in his life. I was 
impressed by him as a young man, and 
that respect and really appreciation 
have only grown over the years. 
For the last 12 years, Judge Stark 
has served as a judge on the Delaware 
Federal district court. It is a court 
with four judgeships. He has had one of 
those seats for about 12 years now. 
Prior to that, he had a distinguished 
academic and professional career in the 
State of Delaware. 
Judge Stark is a fellow University of 
Delaware graduate. We are the Fight-
ing Blue Hens at UD. Len, as he is 
known to his friends and his colleagues 
and his professors, double-majored as 
an undergraduate in political science 
and economics while simultaneously 
working toward his master’s degree. 
Let me just say that again. Judge 
Stark double-majored—this is before 
he was a judge—as an undergraduate in 
political science and economics while 
simultaneously working toward his 
master’s degree. My sister would say 
we call that showing off, but he was 
just showing up and just excelling 
every step of the way. 
During college, Len proved himself to 
be an exceptional student and person, 
earning a full scholarship as a Eugene 
du Pont Memorial distinguished schol-
ar. 
Let me just mention something that 
Judge Stark and I have in common 
from our time at the University of 
Delaware. We both met an individual 
who would change our lives—a distin-
guished, beloved professor of political 
science named Jim Soles, a legendary 
political science professor. 
I don’t know if at the Presiding Offi-
cer’s alma mater the students had an 
opportunity to vote for outstanding 
professor. Dr. Soles won that honor at 
the University of Delaware so many 
times, I think they retired the honor. 
He was just beloved and respected by so 
many students and parents and faculty 
members. 
Fortunately for Leonard Stark and 
fortunately for me, Jim Soles took us 
both under his wing and helped get us 
on the right path and led me to the 
Senate and leads Judge Stark to the 
Senate floor today for this vote on clo-
ture on his nomination. 
Jim Soles was a personal hero to a 
whole lot of us in Delaware and par-
ticularly at the University of Dela-
ware. His mentorship involved a life-
long friendship—one that Judge Stark 
and I still cherish to this day. 
I had been a naval flight officer in 
the Vietnam war, moved from Cali-
fornia to Delaware at the end of the 
war, and ended up working on an MBA. 
My first year in Delaware, I met a guy 
who was running for the Democratic 
nomination, our only congressional 
seat. It was Jim Soles. I was in Dela-
ware for like a year, and I ended up 
going from knowing nobody to being 
the treasurer of a fellow running for 
the U.S. House of Representatives. Our 
Congressman at the time was Pete du 
Pont, a good man, and Jim Soles ran 
against him. I got involved in that 
campaign, and later on, I would meet 
Judge Stark. We bonded right away be-
cause of our affection and respect for 
Dr. Soles. 
But I think it was 12 years ago—12 
years ago—Judge Stark was confirmed, 
I think unanimously, by this body to 
serve on Delaware’s Federal district 
court, and I called him to congratulate 
him. Sure enough, guess who he was 
having dinner with. He was having din-
ner with Jim Soles near the campus of 
the University of Delaware in Newark. 
Jim got to tell Judge Stark how 
proud he was upon his confirmation to 
the Delaware district court, but, sadly, 
not too long after that, we lost our 
dear friend Dr. Jim Soles. 
While he will not be able to have din-
ner with us tonight or with Jim to-
night, I want Judge Stark to know, 
when I call him later this afternoon or 
this evening, that Jim Soles is smiling 
down on him and that Jim would have 
been so proud to see his nomination 
once again advancing on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, let me tell a couple of 
things about Judge Stark, if I could. 
Not long after his graduation from 
the 
University 
of 
Delaware—again, 
where he did a double major as an un-
dergraduate simultaneously while pur-
suing an advanced degree, a master’s 
degree—he went off and studied at Ox-
ford, and he authored numerous aca-
demic and scholarly publications, in-
cluding a book on British politics, 
which he wrote in his spare time be-
tween classes at Oxford. 
After Oxford, Judge Stark went on to 
earn his law degree at Yale Law 
School, where he served as senior edi-
tor of the Yale Law Journal. 
After 
graduation, 
Judge 
Stark 
clerked for legendary Delaware Judge 
Walter Stapleton, who served for years 
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit. 
Judge Stark then began his career in 
public service as an assistant U.S. at-
torney for the State of Delaware, 
where from 2002 to 2007, he handled a 
wide variety of cases, from criminal 
cases to Federal cases, to civil matters 
and others. 
Before his current position as a dis-
trict judge, Judge Stark served as mag-
istrate judge on the U.S. District Court 
of Delaware. It was this role that pre-
pared him—I think quite well—to serve 
as a district court judge. 
In 2010, President Obama nominated 
Judge Stark to fill the vacancy on the 
Delaware district court, and the Senate 
confirmed Judge Stark unanimously— 
unanimously. 
In the years since then, Judge Stark 
has served Delaware and our Nation 
with integrity and with distinction. 
Only 4 years after serving as a district 
judge, in 2014, Judge Stark was ap-
pointed the position of chief judge of 
the Delaware district court, which po-
sition he held until June of this year. 
During his 14 years on the bench in 
Delaware, Judge Stark has presided 
over—get this—over 6,000 civil and 
criminal cases, including over 2,400 pat-
ent cases, and 93 trials, including 63 
patent trials. 
Patent law is of particular impor-
tance to the Federal Circuit, and Judge 
Stark’s experience and expertise in 
these matters make him uniquely 
qualified for this particular judgeship. 
In fact, the Judiciary Committee of 
this Senate received a letter in support 
of Judge Stark’s nomination from the 
Federal Circuit Bar Association that 
highlighted 
the 
breadth 
of 
Judge 
Stark’s experience. The letter states 
that Judge Stark—their language, not 
mine—is ‘‘uniquely well-suited’’ to a 
position on the Federal Circuit. 
And the letter went on to highlight 
his ‘‘integrity, [his] his professional 
competence, and [his] judicial tempera-
ment.’’ 
The Judiciary Committee also re-
ceived a letter of support from the 
American Bar Association, which once 
again 
rated 
Judge 
Stark 
unani-
mously—they rated him ‘‘well quali-
fied’’—well qualified. 
At every stage of his life, Judge 
Stark has performed at the highest 
level. That level of success and work 
ethic is impressive for any field. But 
when it happens on the Federal bench, 
that is for the benefit of our Constitu-
tion and the American people. 
Finally, I might add, Judge Stark is 
known as a consensus builder who 
works to find principled compromises— 
something the Presiding Officer and I 
do every day or at least attempt to. In 
fact, of Judge Stark’s approximately 
2,100 written opinions—2,100 written 
opinions—only 2 percent of them have 
ever been reversed or affirmed with 
criticism, only 2 percent. 
That is part of the reason why he was 
approved in January by a strong bipar-
tisan majority in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. He has the heart of a servant 
and the temperament to be an out-
standing judge on the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Federal Circuit. 
From his studies that took him from 
Newark, DE, across the pond, to Ox-
ford, England, and back to Yale, Judge 
Stark has a stellar record of academic 
achievement. And from his service to 
the American people as an assistant 
U.S. attorney and for the last 12 years 
on the Delaware District Court, Judge 
Stark earned the respect and the admi-
ration of the legal community in Dela-
ware and across our Nation. 
I want to close with this. As the Pre-
siding Officer knows, I was privileged 
to serve as Governor of Delaware for 8 
years, just before I came here to serve

in the U.S. Senate. And I never imag-
ined when I was running for the posi-
tion of Governor how important the 
Governor’s role in Delaware is in terms 
of nominating judges to the Court of 
Chancery and the Delaware Supreme 
Court and superior court and family 
court, and on and on—a lot of courts 
and some with national and even inter-
national respect and roles. 
One of my great regrets is that I 
never had the opportunity to nominate 
Judge Stark, young Leonard Stark. He 
did not apply. I know he was old 
enough but not by much. But I would 
have been very, very proud as Governor 
to have nominated him to serve in any 
one of the courts in Delaware. 
Delaware is a little place that has 
about a million people, about 100 miles 
from north to south and about 50 miles 
from east to west. And it is not pos-
sible to know everybody, but you can 
know a lot of people. And I have been 
privileged to not only just know Leon-
ard Stark but also to know his family 
and to know that one of the reasons 
why he succeeded—I would say one of 
the reasons I succeeded is that we 
picked the right parents, not a lot of 
wealth or fortune or fame but just peo-
ple with really good values and just 
good people. And I just want to say to 
them, thank you for bringing him into 
the world and raising him with wonder-
ful values. 
I want to thank his wife and children 
for sharing their husband and their dad 
with the people of Delaware for all 
these years and for your willingness to 
let us give him a chance to serve in 
this new position. 
From his service to the American 
public as assistant U.S. attorney for 
the last 12 years on the Delaware dis-
trict court, Leonard Stark has earned 
the respect and the admiration of the 
legal community in Delaware and 
across our country. 
I again want to thank our colleagues 
today for voting to take his nomina-
tion to go forward to the next step, and 
I think we will have an opportunity to 
vote next week on the actual confirma-
tion. But I am pleased with the out-
come of today’s vote on cloture. 
We have a State song—I know we 
have a State song in Maryland. I won’t 
sing it here today, but the State song— 
the very first State, Delaware, the first 
State to ratify the Constitution—in-
cludes a line that goes something like 
this: 
The sun is shining over our beloved Dela-
ware. 
And so today, indeed, the Sun is shin-
ing over Delaware. 
We had a National Prayer Breakfast 
in the Capitol this morning in the audi-
torium in the Visitor Center, where the 
speaker was Brian Stephenson, famed 
attorney, defender, author. He was 
here, and he was our keynote speaker 
for the Prayer Breakfast. The cochair 
for the Prayer Breakfast was Senator 
CHRISTOPHER COONS of Delaware. 
The President of the United States 
spoke at the Prayer Breakfast today, 
Joe Biden, a Delawarean. And LISA 
BLUNT
ROCHESTER, 
our 
Congress-
woman, and I had the privilege to be 
there and be part of that family. 
It has been a good day for Delaware. 
I know with the vote to move this 
nomination to the next step, it is an-
other good day for Delaware for this 
reason. It was also a very good day for 
our country and for all who have 
worked hard to make this day possible 
and this step possible. I just want to 
say a heartfelt thank you. 
With that, I yield the floor to an-
other fellow who has a Delaware con-
nection. When he came for orientation 
a few years ago, he was nice enough to 
share with me that—I told him that 
the most popular Senate initials in the 
U.S. Senate were the letters ‘‘TC.’’ 
There were more ‘‘TCs’’ than any set of 
initials in the Senate, and when TED 
CRUZ joined us, we had another one as 
well. 
He shared with me that his grand-
mother was from Wilmington, DE—1 of 
17 children, if I am not mistaken, and 
that gave us a common bond right from 
the get-go. I am happy to yield to my 
friend from Texas for his comments 
today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas is recognized. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, there is a 
gathering storm in Europe. I rise today 
to discuss the brewing crisis posed by 
Russia’s aggression and, tragically, 
how the reckless actions of President 
Biden have enabled it. 
This morning, all 100 Senators par-
ticipated in a classified briefing, where 
we heard from the Secretary of Defense 
and the Secretary of State and the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
We heard about the magnitude of the 
threat from Russia. 
We stand here today with Europe fac-
ing the greatest peril it has faced since 
1945. These are ominous and chilling 
times, and we did not arrive here by ac-
cident. Right now, 150,000 Russian 
troops are directly on the border of 
Ukraine, poised to invade, with more 
troops and more tanks arriving each 
and every day. It was also reported this 
week that Russia has sent additional 
blood supplies to its military equip-
ment on the Ukraine border, another 
ominous signal that Russia plans to in-
vade. 
Ukraine, and indeed the region and 
the world, find ourselves in this crisis 
because of President Biden’s weakness, 
because of his appeasement, because of 
his surrender to Putin over the last 
year. And now, instead of rising to 
meet this moment with strength and 
resolve, President Biden continues to 
shrink from it with more weakness 
than appeasement. 
One question that was raised in the 
briefing this morning is, Why didn’t 
this happen in 2017? Why didn’t it hap-
pen in 2018? Why didn’t it happen in 
2019? Why didn’t it happen in 2020? 
What changed? 
I will suggest what changed. What 
changed is the occupant of the Oval Of-
fice, who has demonstrated weakness 
and appeasement virtually from the 
moment he rested his hand upon the 
Bible. It is a pattern. 
As a result of President Biden’s 
weakness and appeasement, this ad-
ministration gave Afghanistan to the 
Taliban and 13 American servicemem-
bers were tragically murdered. 
As a result of President Biden’s 
weakness and appeasement, this ad-
ministration is ramping up to give a 
nuclear arsenal to the Ayatollah in 
Iran. The very same Ayatollah who 
chants ‘‘Death to Israel’’ and ‘‘Death to 
America,’’ the Biden administration is 
preparing to facilitate that Ayatollah 
having the weapons of mass murder to 
carry out those pledges. 
As a result of President Biden’s 
weakness and appeasement, the Biden 
administration is in the process of 
ceding Taiwan to Xi. President Biden 
has even banned any Taiwanese official 
from displaying a Taiwanese military 
uniform or displaying a Taiwanese flag 
on U.S. Government property. Why? 
Because it offends the communist Gov-
ernment in China. 
And, again, right now, today, as a re-
sult of President Biden’s weakness and 
appeasement, the Biden administration 
is in the process of abandoning Ukraine 
to Vladimir Putin. 
Putin didn’t just wake up one day 
and decide to invade Ukraine. He has 
wanted to invade Ukraine for years. 
And he did so in 2014, but he stopped 
short of a full invasion then because he 
couldn’t endanger Ukraine’s energy in-
frastructure, which Putin needs to get 
Russian natural gas to Europe. So Rus-
sia formed a consortium to build Nord 
Stream 2, a pipeline stretching directly 
from Russia to Germany under the sea 
so that Russian gas could circumvent 
Ukraine altogether. 
We have long known about the dan-
gers Nord Stream 2 poses. That is why, 
in the last few years, Democrats and 
Republicans here in the Senate have 
come together repeatedly and taken bi-
partisan actions, passing sanctions on 
Nord Stream 2 with overwhelming ma-
jorities. 
I led that effort, drafting the Cruz- 
Shaheen sanctions. They were sup-
ported by every Democrat in this 
Chamber. They passed overwhelmingly, 
and they worked. They succeeded. 
They stopped the pipeline literally the 
day they were signed into law. 
The story of how that happened is 
well known to every Senator in this 
Chamber, as is the story of how the 
new 
President—President 
Biden— 
inexplicably and catastrophically de-
cided to squander that hard-fought geo-
political victory and turn a victory for 
America into a loss for America and 
our allies. 
Many a Democratic Senator standing 
on this Senate floor has quietly ex-
pressed frustration, confusion, anger 
why the Biden administration would 
surrender to Russia and give away the 
victory we had won. 
It is not only the decision to sur-
render on Nord Stream 2 and give

Putin the pipeline that enables him to 
invade Ukraine that led to this day. 
Also, for the past year, President Biden 
has repeatedly systematically under-
mined our Ukrainian allies in the face 
of Russian aggression to placate Putin. 
And it is worth noting, Biden does 
this for the same reason he undermines 
Taiwan. He undermines Taiwan to pla-
cate the Chinese communists. He un-
dermines Ukraine to placate Putin. To 
placate Putin, the Biden administra-
tion has repeatedly withheld military 
aid packages to Ukraine. Other times, 
he has withheld diplomatic support to 
pressure our Ukrainian allies into sup-
porting his misguided Nord Stream 2 
surrender to Putin. Biden’s actions for 
the past year have emboldened Putin, 
who acted on that weakness and has 
put Europe on the brink of war. 
So what can we do right now today to 
promote peace and stop an invasion? 
Well, our Ukrainian allies have told 
us again and again what we can do and 
what we should do. All we have to do in 
the Senate is listen to our friends in 
Ukraine who are on the frontline: No. 
1, sanction Nord Stream 2 imme-
diately, right now, today; No. 2, give 
the Ukrainians weapons so that they 
can defend themselves. 
Just last week, the chairman of 
Ukraine’s Parliament wrote a letter to 
the Senate about exactly this. If you 
have not read the letter from the 
Ukrainian Parliament, I commend it to 
you. It is an extraordinary letter from 
a nation on the brink of annihilation 
at the hands of Russian aggression. I 
am going to read parts of that letter 
right now because it is worth quoting 
extensively. 
The chairman of Ukraine’s Par-
liament writes: 
Nord Stream 2 is a source of multidimen-
sional 
security, 
political 
and 
economic 
threats to Ukraine and Europe as a whole. It 
is not an exaggeration that Nord Stream 2 is 
no less an existential threat to Ukraine’s se-
curity and democracy than the Russian 
troops on our border. This pipeline must be 
stopped and the only way to prevent the 
completion is to use all the tools available 
to do that. 
The letter continues: 
So far, the decision to waive sanctions 
against Nord Stream 2 in May 2021— 
That was a decision by President 
Biden— 
has emboldened Russia and caused Moscow 
to conclude that the United States may ac-
commodate its hostile intentions. 
The letter continues: 
After a clear majority of the U.S. Senate 
voted 55–44 in favor of imposing immediate 
sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, on January 
13, 2022, it is essential that Congress include 
immediate sanctions against Nord Stream 2 
AG in any new legislation to undercut op-
tions for Russia’s aggressive actions on 
Ukraine. 
The letter goes on, asking for a 
‘‘clear trigger for the instant and un-
qualified imposition of any sanctions 
that are not imposed immediately upon 
enactment of the legislation,’’ arguing 
that ‘‘while some sanctions—like sanc-
tions against Nord Stream 2—should be 
imposed immediately to demonstrate 
to Moscow that the United States is, 
indeed, serious about serious measures, 
including 
removing 
Russia 
from 
SWIFT, the trigger of these future 
sanctions must be clear in order to be 
effective.’’ 
The letter continues: 
A ‘‘significant escalation in hostilities,’’ 
whose ‘‘aim or effect of undermining, over-
throwing, or dismantling the Government of 
Ukraine, occupying the territory of Ukraine, 
or interfering with the sovereignty or terri-
torial integrity of Ukraine’’ is too high of a 
threshold to deter Russian aggression or af-
fect the Kremlin’s cost-benefit calculus. 
The Ukrainians are crystal clear in 
this letter. The sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2 that Biden waived last year, 
in 
the 
words 
of 
the 
Ukrainians, 
‘‘emboldened 
Russia’’ 
and 
allowed 
Putin to think ‘‘the United States may 
accommodate its hostile intentions.’’ 
In other words, because of Biden’s 
weakness and appeasement on Nord 
Stream 2, Putin thinks there are no se-
rious 
consequences 
to 
invading 
Ukraine. 
So the Ukrainians are asking—they 
are begging of the U.S. Senate—for im-
mediate sanctions on Nord Stream 2. 
Do not abandon them. They cry at 
their hour of need. 
And they also state in the letter that 
‘‘expedited and higher-impact security 
assistance, including air defense, anti- 
ship, and anti-armor capabilities’’ is 
what they need. 
That is what the Ukrainians have 
asked for, but President Biden and 
most of the Senate Democrats aren’t 
doing what our Ukrainian allies have 
called for. Instead, they are looking to 
pile appeasement on top of appease-
ment, and they are doing it in secret. 
The Biden administration has offered 
Putin sweeping concessions on NATO 
when it comes to troops, when it comes 
to missiles, when it comes to military 
exercises. They transmitted this ap-
peasement to Putin in secret and re-
fused to let Americans see the details. 
I have seen the details, and I can tell 
you, they are deeply worrying. The rea-
son the public hasn’t seen them is the 
administration has placed them in a se-
cure SCIF. They are not classified, 
mind you. They are merely ‘‘confiden-
tial,’’ which is Washington speak for 
politically embarrassing, and the ad-
ministration doesn’t want to defend 
the substance of it. 
That is why I am introducing legisla-
tion called the PARTNER Act, which 
would prevent President Biden from 
endangering our longtime allies and 
frontline countries in NATO by prohib-
iting him from removing American 
troops from the countries that border 
Russia—meaning 
Estonia, 
Latvia, 
Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Po-
land—longtime allies. My legislation 
will prevent President Biden from of-
fering yet more appeasement to Russia, 
from offering for America to abandon 
Eastern Europe to Russia, and from al-
lowing President Biden to fatally un-
dermine NATO. 
I also want to address the fact that 
some think we should stand down and 
not resist Russian aggression because 
they say Biden will send American 
troops into Ukraine and start a shoot-
ing war with Russia if Putin invades. I 
want to be clear and unequivocal: We 
should not have American soldiers in 
Ukraine. 
Under 
no 
circumstances 
should we send our sons and daughters 
to die to defend Ukraine from Russia. 
If the Biden administration proposes 
that because their foreign policy is col-
lapsing around that, I will vigorously 
oppose such a move and the vast ma-
jority of Americans do, as well. 
But, critically, the Ukrainians aren’t 
asking for that. Ukraine is not asking 
for a single American soldier. Ukraine 
is saying, Do two things: Sanction 
Nord Stream 2, the pipeline that en-
ables the Russian aggression; and pro-
vide them with the military weapons 
so that they, the Ukrainians, can fight 
to defend their own Nation from the in-
vading Russian Army. 
So Americans are asking: Why should 
we care what happens to Ukraine or 
what happens to NATO countries that 
border Russia? 
Let me be clear. There are some who 
justify American foreign policy and say 
we have an amorphous obligation to 
protect democracies; we have an obli-
gation to protect international norms. 
I think all of that is bunk. We have 
an obligation to protect the national 
security of the United States of Amer-
ica. The Commander in Chief’s obliga-
tion is to keep Americans safe. 
What does that mean in this context? 
Well, I want to make four points. No. 
1, what Putin is trying to do is reas-
semble the USSR. If he succeeds in 
doing so, it would be catastrophic for 
global stability and American security. 
Putin and Russia are an enemy of 
America. When the Soviet Union was 
bigger, stronger, mightier, and with a 
bigger military, the lives of Americans 
and the lives of our allies were in far 
greater jeopardy. It is overwhelmingly 
in America’s interest to prevent Putin 
from reassembling the Soviet Union 
because we do not wish for our enemies 
to become stronger and use that 
strength against us. 
No. 2, Putin is trying to seize control 
of energy. If he is successful, it will be 
felt by Americans filling up their cars 
with gas or trying to heat their homes 
in the winter. We have already seen 
what Putin has done with Nord Stream 
2, and he is not going to stop there. 
No. 3, we have a formal obligation— 
a 
commitment 
the 
United 
States 
made—to help the Ukrainians defend 
themselves. Why is that? Well, after 
Ukraine successfully declared inde-
pendence from the USSR in 1991, the 
United States signed an agreement, an 
agreement called the Budapest Memo-
randum on Security Assurances. With 
the Budapest Memorandum, under the 
terms of it, Ukraine agreed to give up 
its nuclear weapons. Ukraine had the 
third largest stockpile of nuclear weap-
ons on the face of the planet. America

agreed, quite reasonably, that the 
world would be safer if Ukraine did not 
have nukes, and the brandnew Ukrain-
ian Government agreed and gave up 
their nuclear weapons, making Amer-
ica safer and the world safer. 
But the Ukrainian Government did 
not do so for nothing. It did so in ex-
change for explicit assurances that the 
United States would protect Ukraine’s 
territorial integrity. Let me reiterate 
that. The United States made a formal 
commitment to the Ukrainians that if 
they gave up their nuclear weapons, we 
would help them protect themselves. 
The Ukrainians are asking us to honor 
our commitment in the form—and they 
are very specific about what they are 
asking—in the form of immediate sanc-
tions on Nord Stream 2 and weapons so 
they can defend themselves. 
We need to send them that lethal aid, 
the kind of firepower the Ukrainians 
need to defend themselves, not the 
blankets and teddy bears and meals 
that the Obama administration sent 
the last time Russia invaded Ukraine. 
No. 4, we have treaty obligations to 
NATO countries on the frontlines of 
Putin’s aggression. Putin wants NATO 
to withdraw foreign forces, including 
American forces from the countries 
that border Russia—from Bulgaria, 
from Poland, from Romania, from Es-
tonia, from Latvia, from Lithuania. 
But to withdraw American forces from 
NATO would be seen as—in fact, it 
would be—an abdication of our com-
mitment to NATO. It would either 
shatter the NATO alliance, the most 
successful alliance in modern history, 
or it would put into motion dynamics 
that would ultimately shatter NATO, 
which is why, as I mentioned, I am in-
troducing the PARTNER Act, to pre-
vent the Biden administration—their 
weakness and appeasement—from de-
stroying NATO and undermining Amer-
ican security. 
On every one of these four points, 
Biden has demonstrated weakness and 
appeasement to Putin. And I would 
note that you might ask: Why should 
America honor our commitments? Why 
should we honor our commitment in 
the Budapest Memorandum, honor our 
treaty commitments to the NATO 
countries? Because one of the ways we 
protect American national security is 
when we make an agreement with a 
country—when we make a formal, legal 
agreement—we 
honor 
our 
commit-
ments. And we want countries to know 
that we stand by our friends, that we 
stand by our word, that our treaties 
mean something, because if countries 
learn that under weak and feckless 
Presidents, our treaties—our formal, 
binding, legal documents—aren’t worth 
the paper they are written on, it under-
mines the ability of any President of 
the United States to negotiate agree-
ments with our friends and allies that 
keep Americans safe. 
When Ronald Reagan was standing 
up and confronting the ‘‘Evil Empire,’’ 
we saw the virtues of peace through 
strength. 
Biden’s foreign policy seems to invite 
war through weakness. There are ac-
tions we can take today, like sanc-
tioning Nord Stream 2, like sending le-
thal aid to Ukraine, like committing to 
keep our NATO forces in countries that 
border Russia. 
All of these actions would show 
Putin that the United States will stand 
up to aggression and defend our na-
tional interests. We should take these 
actions without delay. We should stand 
in bipartisan unity in support of Amer-
ican national security, in opposition to 
Russian aggression. If we do not, if the 
Senate acquiesces to Biden’s weakness 
and appeasement and Russia invades 
Ukraine and, weeks from now, there 
are Russian tanks in the streets of 
Kyiv, Ukraine and Europe and America 
and the world will reap the whirlwind. 
This is our opportunity to act. I pray 
that we take it.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

CHIPS FOR AMERICA ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in 
the summer of 2020, the senior Senator 
from Virginia, Senator WARNER, and I 
introduced the CHIPS for America Act 
to reshore semiconductor manufac-
turing here in the United States. 
I didn’t know much about semi-
conductors when we got started, but I 
have learned a lot, and what I have 
learned is that this is an essential com-
modity 
that 
we 
have 
over 
time 
offshored to places like Asia that we 
need to reshore or bring back to Amer-
ica for our economy and for national 
security. 
Currently, 90 percent of the semi-
conductors in the world are manufac-
tured in Asia. Sixty-three percent of 
the semiconductors in the world come 
from one place: Taiwan. If COVID has 
taught us one thing, it has taught us 
how vulnerable our supply chains can 
be. And the truth is, semiconductors 
have become so critical to our way of 
life, to our economy, and to our na-
tional security, to everything we do, 
that if that supply were blocked for 
some reason—either as a result of an-
other pandemic or a natural disaster 
or, Heaven forbid, a military conflict— 
it would be devastating to the United 
States and our economy and our na-
tional security. 
That is why, when our bill was intro-
duced as an amendment to the Defense 
authorization bill, it passed 96 to 4. 
Clearly, we had strong, bipartisan sup-
port here in the Senate. It took less 
than 7 months from the time we intro-
duced the bill until it became law, and 
then 6 months later, the Senate passed 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act, with $52 billion in funding for the 
CHIPS Program. 
Had this legislation been introduced 
years ago, before the pandemic, I don’t 
think it would have received either 
such quick action or such broad bipar-
tisan support. That is not because this 
type of investment wasn’t needed. 
There is clear data that showed a con-
cerning trend in U.S. chip manufac-
turing. 
We saw big investments made by 
other countries in their own capabili-
ties and a business model primarily by 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 
Company, which I visited along with 
colleagues in Taipei just a few months 
ago, where their business model is to 
manufacture 
chips 
made 
and 
de-
signed—I should say designed by com-
panies that need those semiconductors. 
But rather than build their own manu-
facturing capability, their own found-
ry, they outsourced that to Taiwan 
Semiconductor. So Taiwan and par-
ticularly Taiwan Semiconductor have 
become the focal point for the produc-
tion of semiconductors around the 
world. 
Well, there was general agreement 
that something should be done before 
COVID–19, but it certainly wasn’t at 
the top of everyone’s priority list. But, 
as I said, when the pandemic hit, the 
vulnerability of our supply chains for 
everything from PPE—personal protec-
tive equipment—to semiconductors be-
came apparent. 
Well, how has that affected everyday 
Texans, folks from Nevada or Colo-
rado? Well, we found out that an ab-
sence or a lack of semiconductors 
meant empty car lots. You couldn’t 
buy a new car. You couldn’t get a com-
puter, perhaps for your child to be able 
to study virtually during a quarantine 
period or during a period of virtual 
learning at schools across the country. 
We saw higher prices adding to the 
problem 
with 
inflation. 
Suddenly, 
those concerning data points turned 
into real-world problems. Consumers 
who never even dreamed or thought 
about a semiconductor before found 
themselves impacted by this global 
shortage. The new car they had been 
saving up for wasn’t available. The 
Christmas gift they planned to order 
for their children was out of stock. 
While the lack of consumer products 
is a big problem, it pales in comparison 
to the security risk created by the chip 
shortage. Simply put, semiconductors 
are vital to our critical infrastructure. 
Our grid keeps on the lights and makes 
it possible to heat our buildings during 
the cold of winter. They run our cell 
towers that enable us to talk on our 
cell phones or download data and do

searches on the web. They are critical 
to our energy grid, our water treat-
ment plants, and our agricultural sec-
tor. Semiconductor chips make it all 
possible. 
As I said, our national defense also 
depends on semiconductors. When we 
send our troops on any mission by air, 
sea, land, or cyber space, they need the 
best equipment available, and usually 
what that means is the most advanced 
technology available. Advanced fight-
ers, quantum computing, missile de-
fense—all rely on semiconductors. 
I asked my staff to research back 
when Israel was using the Iron Dome 
missile defense system to knock rock-
ets out of the sky that were destined to 
hit population centers in Israel. I said: 
Find out for me how many semiconduc-
tors are in each one of those missile de-
fense interceptors. They came back 
with a figure of 750 chips in each one of 
those missile defense interceptors. 
So it is not hard to imagine we would 
be in big trouble if a lack of supply 
crippled any of these functions, and un-
fortunately, it is a real possibility. 
Over the years, domestic chip produc-
tion has steadily dropped as other 
countries have upped their manufac-
turing capabilities. As I said, 90 per-
cent of that manufacturing is now in 
Asia. 
We had the idea—and it is not a crazy 
idea—that if somebody could make 
things cheaper overseas, then that is 
the most efficient way for that product 
to be made, but we didn’t calculate 
these supply chain problems which 
COVID–19 exposed. 
But we know, as I said, that if there 
were another pandemic or let’s say a 
natural disaster or a military conflict, 
the People’s Republic of China has 
made no secret about its plan to unify 
with Taiwan. President Xi has explic-
itly said invasion of Taiwan will hap-
pen, and he has asked that his military 
be ready by the year 2027. But we don’t 
actually know what his timetable may 
be, and if China follows through on its 
threats to invade Taiwan and inter-
rupts that supply chain of critical 
semiconductors, it would be dramati-
cally bad for the United States and the 
world. Our national security and crit-
ical infrastructure could be hobbled by 
a single decision made by the President 
of the People’s Republic of China. 
I was reminded of Jimmy Carter’s 
1980 speech at the State of the Union 
when he spoke about instability in the 
Persian Gulf and Soviet threats to the 
movement of Middle East oil through 
the Strait of Hormuz. President Carter 
said at the time—when we were so de-
pendent on imported oil from the Mid-
dle East—he said any attempt to gain 
control of the Persian Gulf and to 
block the Strait of Hormuz would be 
‘‘regarded as an assault on the vital in-
terests of the United States of Amer-
ica.’’ 
You could say the same about a 
blockade that prevented us from get-
ting semiconductors from Asia. Just as 
the Soviets could have blocked the 
Strait of Hormuz and choked off the 
global supply, the People’s Republic of 
China could seize Taiwan’s supply of 
chips and its manufacturing facilities 
and hold the rest of the world at risk. 
The United States and our allies would 
be left fighting for the crumbs, what 
was left over. 
Our country isn’t the only one, fortu-
nately, that spotted this blinking red 
light. Other countries are pouring tens 
of billions of dollars into new semicon-
ductor foundries. The European Union 
is now investing up to $35 billion. 
South Korea is investing $65 billion. 
The People’s Republic of China is re-
portedly investing $150 billion in semi-
conductor manufacturing. 
The United States cannot be left be-
hind, and we can’t drag our feet. Un-
like PPE—personal protective equip-
ment—or hand sanitizer shortages, this 
one cannot be solved quickly. Compa-
nies that make other technologies 
can’t just adjust to the lack of semi-
conductors. In order to build a single 
chip, you need very expensive, highly 
advanced equipment, you need very 
skilled workers, and you need a lot of 
time. It can take literally months to 
build a single chip, and that is assum-
ing you have the facilities and the ex-
pertise to do so. 
So it is not hyperbole to say that 
there are life-or-death consequences to 
a reliable semiconductor supply chain, 
which is why this has been such a high- 
priority item on a bipartisan basis here 
in the Senate. 
The U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act included $52 billion to fund this 
program and ensure that, once again, 
we could maintain a strong supply of 
advanced semiconductors. That legisla-
tion, which included an emergency ap-
propriation, passed by a vote of 68 to 
32, which is pretty impressive these 
days with the polarization that we are 
all dealing with—a strong, bipartisan 
vote. 
Unfortunately, the momentum that 
bill had ended when it got to the House 
of Representatives. The Speaker of the 
House had other priorities, and months 
and months went by. Our House col-
leagues said they wanted to pass their 
own version of this legislation, and 
they have every right to do so, but 
time is not on our side, and they need 
to act quickly. Every day that goes by 
is a day that China inches ahead of the 
United States and that we fall further 
behind. 
We need to get this funding out the 
door and to begin that construction of 
these fabs, which take a considerable 
amount of time to build, underway as 
soon as we can. 
In a year’s time, Senator WARNER 
and I introduced the CHIPS Act, it be-
came law, and the Senate funded the 
program we created. We are not ordi-
narily known for our speed, and the 
quick timeline is indicative of how ur-
gent this problem really is. 
I don’t have any excuse for the 
House’s failure to address this issue for 
7 months, but now it sounds like they 
are beginning to think about address-
ing it. 
Well, I can understand why the proc-
ess would take so long if the House was 
actually engaged in a bipartisan nego-
tiation, but, unfortunately, it looks 
like they are going to pass a partisan 
bill with no Republican support be-
cause they were not included in the 
discussions. 
The 
Democratic 
com-
mittee chairmen refused to consult 
with the Republican ranking members, 
and it looks like they are going to 
produce a partisan bill. 
Well, that bill I do not believe would 
pass the U.S. Senate. The House bill 
contains $8 billion for an unaccount-
able U.N. climate slush fund, which has 
provided more than $100 million for the 
People’s Republic of China. 
What we are talking about—what we 
should be talking about—is countering 
threats from China, not helping China. 
The partisan bill from the House has 
also added provisions related to immi-
gration, from creating new types of 
visas to removing green card caps. Im-
migration is an important issue. We 
ought to be talking about it. We ought 
to be doing something about it, but not 
on a partisan basis. 
These changes should not be tacked 
on to this legislation at the last hour. 
They need to be debated and marked up 
by the appropriate committees and 
given the sort of careful consideration 
that they deserve. 
The House bill also includes addi-
tional handouts to favorite political 
constituencies, 
from 
massive 
slush 
funds to burdensome new labor require-
ments. Organized labor would be the 
big winner in the House bill, but not 
rank-and-file Americans. 
It is not just what is in this bill that 
is a problem. I am talking about the 
House bill, now. It is what was left out. 
The bill’s trade title is completely in-
adequate. It extends and expands trade 
adjustment assistance, but it com-
pletely excludes trade promotion au-
thority. We know that trade promotion 
authority is critical to negotiating 
strong 
trade 
agreements 
without 
lengthy delays. 
So I regret and I am very dis-
appointed that the House has wasted 
available time, particularly when this 
vulnerability to the semiconductor 
supply chain is so grave and so urgent. 
We have a responsibility to secure 
our most critical supply chains while 
creating 
thousands 
of 
high-paying 
American jobs and boosting our global 
competitiveness. So I hope that once 
the House does pass a bill that we 
quickly form a formal conference com-
mittee in order to make the final prod-
uct look a whole lot like the Senate 
bill that we passed with strong bipar-
tisan majorities. 
Let me just comment in closing that 
I am a big fan of the Wall Street Jour-
nal. I read it or, at least, parts of it 
every day. But I was concerned that a 
treatment of this legislation in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S514 
February 3, 2022 
Wall Street Journal editorial yester-
day—actually, it was this morning—ei-
ther was unclear or provided misin-
formation about the importance of 
these semiconductors. 
The title of the editorial was ‘‘The Be 
More Like China Act.’’ And suffice it 
to say, they were not fans of either the 
House or the Senate bill. 
But they made this statement. They 
said: ‘‘[T]he Pentagon is already pro-
viding incentives to make advanced 
chips in the United States, and [Tai-
wan Semiconductor] is building a $12 
billion plant in Arizona.’’ 
To the second issue, the reason why 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 
Company is building a fab in Arizona is 
in the expectation that the Senate will 
pass this $52 billion incentive program, 
and through the Department of Com-
merce, grants will be made which will 
level the playing field. When it comes 
to the cost of building these fabs in the 
United States, it costs roughly 30 per-
cent more to build a manufacturing fa-
cility, a fab, in the United States than 
it does in Asia, which is the reason why 
they are mainly there. 
But I think what the Wall Street 
Journal was talking about was some-
thing very different than what we are 
trying to do here with reshoring manu-
facturing of semiconductors. 
The Wall Street Journal, I believe, is 
talking about the Department of De-
fense’s zero-trust semiconductor pur-
chasing model. In other words, we 
needed a trusted foundry to build semi-
conductors for our most important 
weapon systems and aircraft, like the 
F–35, and so this is not a manufac-
turing facility that will supply the 
semiconductors that are needed by our 
growing economy and for national se-
curity. This is a very narrow, targeted 
program at the Department of Defense, 
and, like I said, the Department of De-
fense’s secure foundry or trusted sup-
plier program is not a substitute for 
what we are trying to do here. 
Finally, let me say that there is 
broad bipartisan agreement about how 
important it is that we get this CHIPS 
Act passed. 
Secretary Raimondo, the Secretary 
of Commerce, whom I have come to 
know and come to work with and re-
spect, said to CNBC yesterday: ‘‘The 
U.S. is dangerously dependent on Tai-
wan’s semiconductor manufacturing, 
which is in a fragile situation, which I 
have tried to describe.’’ 
I agree with Secretary Raimondo. 
This is something that the President 
wants done. This is something the Sen-
ate has spoken to and passed on a 
broad bipartisan basis, and this is 
something that we need to do without 
further delay. 
So I hope the House will pass the bill 
if for no other reason than to give us a 
bill that we can conference the Senate 
bill with. But in the end, the Senate 
bill needs to be the template for what 
is ultimately done by the conference 
committee and what is ultimately 
passed by the U.S. Congress. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, first 
I would like to congratulate the senior 
Senator from Texas for his leadership 
on this incredibly important issue with 
Senator WARNER, the senior Senator 
from Virginia. 
It really is important that we get 
this passed. Our national security de-
pends on it. I think the American econ-
omy depends on it. 
The Senator mentioned that there 
was a time in our country’s history not 
long ago—I am going to use my words, 
not his, but I will paraphrase it—where 
I think we thought that making things 
as cheaply as possible was the same 
thing as making things as efficiently 
as possible. And I would argue that we 
privileged the people in our economy 
who wanted to make stuff as cheaply 
as possible in China when there are a 
lot of really other important values at 
work, including our national security, 
the supply chains that we rely on, 
making sure that communities in our 
country have jobs and wages being cre-
ated. 
I think we have an incredible oppor-
tunity as a nation to come together 
and build an economy that, when it 
grows, grows for everybody once again. 
And in my mind, that is what this bill 
represents. 
So I just want to say to the Senator 
from Texas how grateful I am for his 
leadership, and I hope that it won’t be 
long before we pass it. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 2497 
Madam President, 80 years ago this 
month, President Franklin Roosevelt 
signed Executive Order 9066, 2 months 
after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and 
it led to some of the most disgraceful 
chapters in our Nation’s history—the 
forced dispossession, relocation, and 
concentration of over 120,000 Japanese 
Americans during World War II. 
Two-thirds of them were citizens of 
this country, forced out of their homes 
and into internment camps by their 
own government. They were our neigh-
bors, and they were parents and shop-
keepers and students, doctors and fac-
tory workers. They were Americans in 
every sense of the word. 
But racist fear forced them into 
these camps—crowded, squalid, and at 
war with everything that we stand for 
as a nation. One of those camps was 
Amache in Colorado, where nearly 
10,000 Japanese Americans were de-
tained against their will. 
This is a photo of that camp. 
I will mention, just because I looked 
it up—I figured this might be true, be-
cause we have Senators from Nevada 
and Texas here—that there were five 
such places in Texas, as well—intern-
ment camps. 
But this is one that was in south-
eastern Colorado, and these children 
are 
among 
the 
first 
arrivals 
at 
Amache, and they were forced to build 
the camp where their own families 
were interned for the duration of the 
war. 
I can’t tell exactly the ages of the 
children in this photo, but I would be 
surprised if the pages on this floor are 
any older than them. And I would say 
to the President, in front of the pages, 
to ask them to imagine a time when 
our country interned people the age of 
the people who are pages on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. 
I have had the opportunity to visit 
Amache a few years ago with John 
Hopper, who is a high school teacher, a 
principal, out there near the camp, who 
along with his students, created the 
Amache Preservation Society. 
There wasn’t anybody else to do it. It 
was just a high school teacher and his 
students. They recognized how much 
this site meant to Colorado, how much 
this site meant to the country. And, 
acting completely on their own, they 
worked year after year after year to re-
store the site so that the next genera-
tion of Coloradans and Americans—the 
young people sitting on this floor 
today—would have the opportunity to 
learn about what happened here. 
If it were up to me, every student in 
Colorado and throughout the American 
West and, for that matter, in our entire 
country would come to this site and 
learn 
about 
the 
Americans 
of 
Amache—the men and women who held 
on to hope year after year, who sup-
ported one another, who forged a com-
munity behind the barbed wires of this 
site, who never gave up on the United 
States of America, even as it was in-
terning them on their own soil. 
And if they did go to Amache, they 
could learn about one of my heroes, 
Colorado’s 
former 
Governor 
Ralph 
Carr, who spoke out against what was 
happening at a time when most politi-
cians in the West and in this country— 
going all the way up to our President, 
Franklin Roosevelt—were either not 
speaking out or allowing this to hap-
pen. 
At that time, many Western Gov-
ernors opposed internment camps, not 
just because they were unjust but—I 
am sorry. At that time, many Western 
Governors were comfortable locking up 
their fellow citizens so long as they 
were locked up in someone else’s State 
because there was an anti-Japanese 
American prejudice in the land. 
Some Coloradans in nearby commu-
nities gave way to shameful fear of 
their fellow citizens and objected to 
their presence. To say the least, they 
objected to their presence. 
Speaking to an angry crowd one day 
on the Eastern Plains—I say to my col-
league from Texas that this is where 
my colleague Senator Cory Gardner 
was from, this part of the State of Col-
orado—Governor Carr said: ‘‘I am talk-
ing to . . . all American people whether 
their status be white, brown or black 
. . . when I say that if a majority may 
deprive a minority of its freedom, con-
trary to the terms of the Constitution 
today, then you as a minority may be 
subjected to the same ill-will of the 
majority tomorrow.’’ 
He went on: ‘‘The Japanese are pro-
tected by the same Constitution that

protects us. An American citizen of 
Japanese descent has the same rights 
as any other citizen. . . . If you harm 
them, you must first harm me.’’ 
He went on to lose his next election. 
I think it was to the U.S. Senate. And 
I shudder to think what would have 
happened if people like Governor Carr 
hadn’t been there to stand for our high-
est ideals as a country, or if survivors 
and their descendants and community 
leaders, many of whom have close con-
nections to Colorado to this day or who 
live in Colorado to this day, hadn’t 
worked for decades to preserve the site 
and the memory of what happened 
there. 
Thanks to their work, we now have 
the opportunity to give Amache the 
recognition and resources it deserves. 
That is why I introduced this bill, 
along 
with 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
HICKENLOOPER, to make Amache part 
of the National Park System. This 
would ensure Amache has the legal sta-
tus and funding to preserve the site 
and the memory of what happened 
there for years to come. 
In the House, Congressmen KEN BUCK 
and JOE NEGUSE introduced the bill. 
Not everybody here would know this, 
but I know Congressman BUCK would 
know this. He and I ran against each 
other in 2009 and 2010. That was a 
tough, tough, tough election, and I 
barely—barely—won. I barely won. But 
I am proud to serve with Congressman 
BUCK in the House and Congressman 
NEGUSE in the House who also have 
come together, just like me and Sen-
ator HICKENLOOPER, to support this 
bill. 
This site is in KEN BUCK’s district in 
Prowers County. KEN won 74 percent of 
the vote there in 2020. By the way, I 
think I won 33 percent in 2016, so KEN 
is outpacing me there. We don’t agree 
on a lot, but we agree 100 percent that 
this matters to our State and the leg-
acy we want to pass on to the next gen-
eration. 
I have a list of 65 groups that support 
this bill: the Asian Chamber of Com-
merce, the Colorado Council of Church-
es, the Colorado Municipal League. If 
that weren’t enough, the bill also has 
the support of the chairman and the 
ranking member of the Environment 
and Natural Resources Committee. 
But today, there is 1 Senator out of 
99—and it is not the senior Senator 
from Texas—who is objecting to this 
bill. 
This bill passed the House of Rep-
resentatives with all but two votes. We 
have 99 Senators on one side who sup-
port this and 1 objecting. I have abso-
lutely no idea why that one Senator is 
objecting, and I hope that it is just a 
misunderstanding of some kind. We 
fight for a lot of things on this floor, 
but there is a bipartisan tradition 
going back to Teddy Roosevelt of both 
parties coming together to protect 
places that matter to our heritage as a 
nation. 
Amache matters to Colorado, and it 
matters to America. This is about 
whether we are going to ignore the 
worst parts of our history or lift them 
up and give future generations the op-
portunity to learn from them so that 
we can move this country closer to our 
highest ideals. 
So I hope that the Senator who is ob-
jecting to this bipartisan bill, with 
massive support in both the House and 
Senate, that is of critical importance 
to the State of Colorado, that doesn’t 
touch or concern any other State in 
the Union, except to the extent that 
people from those States of the Union 
might someday like to come here and 
learn an important episode in our 
country’s 
history—I 
feel 
strongly 
about this, in part, because my own 
mom and her family were dislocated by 
the same war. They were living on the 
other side of the world in Poland. The 
entire family was killed except for an 
aunt and my grandparents and my 
mom. And she got here when she was 11 
years old, which is probably the same 
age as these young children here who 
were picked up from their homes all 
across the Western United States and 
brought to a place that they never had 
known before. It seems to me, the least 
we could do, with this massive bipar-
tisan support, is to pass this bill. 
So as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 255, H.R. 2497; 
further, that the committee-reported 
amendment be agreed to; that the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, due to the 
winter storms that are shutting down 
airports around the country, Senator 
LEE, the Senator from Utah, who ob-
jects to this unanimous consent re-
quest is not here, and I had the bad 
luck to be here when he communicated 
to me his desire that I make an objec-
tion on his behalf. 
I would say to my friend from Colo-
rado, I am a noncombatant on this 
issue. I didn’t hold his bill. But I know 
Senator LEE does have an amendment, 
I believe, he wants to offer, and cer-
tainly he wants to be here to partici-
pate in the discussion and vote on the 
bill. So on his behalf, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
thank the senior Senator from Texas 
who, in fact, is a noncombatant in this 
effort. And I am sorry that he has had 
the misfortune of having to come out 
here and object. 
I will say that Colorado and Utah are 
right next to each other, and I faced 
the same travel issues that the Senator 
from Utah faces, I guess. I hope he gets 
where he is trying to go, but I stayed 
here this evening not because I ob-
jected to this but because I thought it 
was so incredibly important for us to 
get this work done. 
And I want the record to reflect that 
I actually didn’t name the Senator who 
objected, but the Senator from Texas 
did. 
My fervent hope is that we can work 
this out because, really importantly, 
we are having the anniversary of 
Franklin Roosevelt’s decision to inter 
these young people this month. And if 
we don’t get this back to the House of 
Representatives, we may miss that an-
niversary, 
and 
people 
in 
Colorado 
would miss the chance to be able to 
demonstrate that they are carrying 
this really important legacy forward. 
When I think about my mom’s expe-
rience and the experiences here and the 
country that these young men and 
women are growing up in who are with 
us today, it just makes me think even 
more about how important all of this 
is. And, Madam President, I can’t 
think of anybody I would rather have 
this discussion with than with you pre-
siding in the Chair. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
REMEMBERING FRANK MOORE 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to remember the late Frank 
Moore of Oregon. Frank passed away 
last month at 98. 
The story of Frank Moore is really at 
least three stories. It is a story about a 
war hero; it is a story about a natural 
resources hero; and it is a love story, 
which is the only way to describe his 
wonderful 
marriage 
with 
his 
wife 
Jeanne, who survives him. 
To begin, Frank will always be re-
membered in our corner of the Nation 
as a legendary fly fisherman who chan-
neled his love of the Umpqua River 
into protecting and preserving this ex-
traordinary natural treasure in South-
ern Oregon. 
It has been said in fishing circles: 
Most of the world is covered by water. A 
fisherman’s job is simple: Pick out the best 
parts. 
And my friend Frank picked out, 
consistently, the best parts of his ex-
traordinary life, and all of us as Orego-
nians are better off for his good judg-
ments about the Umpqua and about so 
much else in Oregon. 
After returning to our State from 
World War II, storming Utah Beach at 
Normandy on D-day and later fighting 
at the Battle of the Bulge, Frank 
bought the Steamboat Inn with his 
wife and work teammate, Jeanne. To-
gether, they provided generations of

visitors an unmatched recreation expe-
rience on the North Umpqua. 
In the decades that followed, Frank 
became a fly fisherman so, so revered, 
so quintessentially Oregon, that he 
could count our late Governor, Tom 
McCall—an extraordinary fisherman in 
his own right—as just a fishing buddy. 
We call it the Oregon Way, where Or-
egonians come together to keep our 
State so special for living, working, 
and raising a family. 
I will tell the Presiding Officer, I 
know Oregon is a long way from Geor-
gia, but the fact is, there isn’t any-
thing that is more ‘‘Oregon Way,’’ that 
shortens the distance between Oregon 
and the rest of the country, than prior-
ities like fishing and having a special 
relationship with somebody like Tom 
McCall. 
With respect to his war heroism, in 
addition to earning France’s highest 
award of merit for his World War II 
service, we saw Frank’s extraordinary 
accomplishments in Oregon when we 
talked about his work in natural re-
sources and what we saw when he got 
together with friends, and I am going 
to talk about one particularly eventful 
meeting. 
Frank was named Oregon’s Wildlife 
Federation’s Conservationist of the 
Year in 1969. He served on the State 
Fish and Wildlife Commission from 
1971 to 1974. He was among the leaders 
in getting passed the Oregon Forest 
Practices 
law 
to 
protect 
fish 
in 
streams. He earned the International 
Federation of Fly Fishers Conserva-
tionist of the Year Award in 2003, and 
he was inducted into the Fresh Water 
Fishing Hall of Fame in 2010. 
I had a chance to have some of the 
most memorable experiences I have 
had in public service with Frank 
Moore. Back when I was chairman of 
the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, I remember being in the 
backyard of the Ratzlaffs, Jim and 
Jane Ratzlaff, of Roseburg, OR. Jim 
has passed. I continue to stay in touch 
with Jane. And in their backyard one 
wonderful day, where my former staff-
er, Mary Gautreaux, who is up in Heav-
en listening to this discussion, the late 
Mary Gautreaux, we conceived of the 
idea of all working together to protect 
100,000 acres of public lands in the 
Steamboat 
Creek 
watershed 
for 
steelhead preservation. 
I say to the Presiding Officer, as 
former chairman of the committee, I 
have been through some of the rituals 
that we all see in the committee proc-
ess—and I am sure my colleague has 
gnashed his teeth over one or two of 
them already—but one of the things 
that we noted early on is that this in-
credible love affair between Frank and 
Jeanne that went on for decades didn’t 
really fit into the legislative process so 
I wanted to name a Frank and Jeanne 
Moore Wild Steelhead Sanctuary after 
both of them because they were part-
ners in life, partners at the Steamboat 
Inn, partners in everything. 
Well, I just checked in with the inim-
itable David Brooks, who is our guy at 
the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee who has worked for decades 
on preserving these treasures. At the 
time, David reminded me, you really 
had a tradition of not being able to 
name one of these bills to protect your 
treasures after two people. It was not 
like it was a law; it was a tradition, 
but members felt kind of strongly 
about it. I won’t mention any names. 
But Frank Moore, when I told him 
that, he said: RON, I love you to pieces, 
but this bill has got to be named for 
both of us because we have been part-
ners in life. We have been partners in 
the Steamboat Inn and in the sanc-
tuary and the like. 
So I went back and told David 
Brooks about this. And, finally, I am 
not sure everybody actually agreed to 
name it after Frank and Jeanne, this 
wonderful love affair, but I just basi-
cally did it. And around here, as the 
Presiding Officer knows, sometimes if 
you do it, other people won’t raise a 
fuss. That is how Frank Moore of 
Southern Oregon ensured that, for all 
time, we would have a wonderful place 
known as the Frank and Jeanne Moore 
Wild Steelhead Sanctuary, as a monu-
ment to make sure, for generations to 
come, young people would have a spe-
cial place to go. 
I would just note, because I talked to 
her just a few minutes ago, that Col-
leen Moore Bechtel, who is a teacher at 
West 
Intermediate 
School 
in 
Sutherlin—she and her class may be 
watching this proceeding today. They 
were trying to figure out how to get C– 
SPAN on live. I will have more to say 
about Colleen before I wrap up. 
But I am so pleased because that is 
exactly what Frank and Jeanne, to this 
day, have always wanted—was to make 
sure that our treasures, our really spe-
cial places, would be there for the fu-
ture. So I am hoping, if they weren’t 
able to see it live, that Colleen will be 
able to show these remarks to all the 
kids at the Douglas County school, 
West Intermediate in Sutherlin, what 
their 
U.S. 
Senator 
thought 
about 
Frank Moore. 
The last time I visited with Frank 
and 
Jeanne 
in 
October 
2020, 
cir-
cumstances had really dealt them a 
tough hand. We had a horrible fire 
known as the Archie Creek Fire. It had 
destroyed the log cabin that Frank had 
built above the Umpqua, and Frank 
and Jeanne were living with their 
daughter, Colleen, and her family in 
Glide. But you would have never 
known from Frank about that loss of a 
lifetime’s work and care. 
Instead, that fall afternoon, on a 
pretty front porch in rural Douglas 
County, Frank came striding out onto 
the porch with that wonderful smile, a 
bone-crushing handshake, and one joke 
after another, with a twinkle in his 
eyes. He was always optimistic about 
our State, an optimist on that day 
right after his treasured home had been 
ravaged by fire. 
He never wavered from that focus. In 
fact, this past July, I was so pleased 
that he wrote an opinion piece in our 
publication, Eugene’s Register-Guard, 
that detailed how the ‘‘wild & scenic 
river’’ 
designation 
had 
helped 
the 
North Umpqua. He talked about his in-
volvement with me to promote the 
River Democracy Act—a really fresh 
approach endorsed by hundreds of 
small, rural businesses to ensure that 
we preserve our treasures and also tap 
the full potential for the recreation 
economy. 
Now, there have been a lot of recent 
remembrances of Frank, and almost all 
of them talk about him being a giant of 
Oregon. Those characterizations—cer-
tainly of his impact on the southern 
part of my State and our entire State— 
are on point. I want to make sure, 
though, 
that 
something 
else 
that 
Frank said can stick with me. He was 
always quoted as saying the important 
thing was that Jeanne was with him. 
Referring to Jeanne, his wife of 79 
years, Frank said: 
I have the treasure with me. That’s my 
treasure. 
And I can tell the Presiding Officer 
that virtually every time I saw this 
wonderful couple, they were holding 
hands. It just said it all—holding 
hands. And they had been married for 
79 years. 
So tonight I just want to say to 
Jeanne, to all of Frank’s loved ones, to 
all of the kids who may be following 
this in Oregon schools, I am just going 
to add: Frank is always going to be Or-
egon’s treasure. And on behalf of Or-
egonians, who are certainly scattered 
almost everywhere, I thank you for 
sharing Frank with all of us. And I am 
speaking on behalf of Oregonians ev-
erywhere. 
Through 
the 
Frank 
and 
Jeanne 
Moore Wild Steelhead Sanctuary and 
so many other ‘‘best parts’’ that Frank 
leaves as his legacy, Frank Moore will 
never be forgotten. 
With that, I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING GEORGETOWN 
UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1961, 
when I was deciding where to attend 
law school, I was looking for an insti-
tution where I could not only learn 
about the law in the abstract, but also 
how it is applied, interpreted, and writ-
ten. I was immediately drawn to the 
Georgetown University Law Center, 
given that is steps from the U.S. Cap-
itol and Supreme Court. The education 
that I received in my years at George-
town Law helped me to understand 
that the way in which the law is writ-
ten directly impacts the lives and live-
lihoods of millions of people, affirmed 
the importance of working to uphold 
and improve the law, and guided me to-
ward a career in public service. 
And I am not the only person in the 
Senate who had this experience at 
Georgetown Law. Senators HIRONO, 
DURBIN, VAN HOLLEN, and SULLIVAN all 
count themselves as alumni. House Ma-
jority Leader STENY HOYER was my 
classmate. Graduates of Georgetown 
Law also work in offices across the 
Capitol, including my own, using their 
legal education to help serve constitu-
ents, drive measureable change in our 
communities, and better our legal sys-
tem. 
For many Americans, the events of 
the past few years have brought into 
focus the importance of preserving our 
Nation’s institutions and the collective 
work that must be done to ensure that 
they work better for all Americans. As 
a result, thousands more Americans 
have flocked to law school in recent ap-
plication cycles. With its location in 
Washington, DC, and its wealth of 
courses, incredible practitioners and 
faculty, and innovative research cen-
ters, Georgetown Law has been well-po-
sitioned to take advantage of the 
heightened interest in the legal field. 
For the 2021–2022 academic year, 
Georgetown University Law Center re-
ceived a record 14,052 applications, an 
increase of 41 percent of the previous 
year. This incredible achievement dem-
onstrates Georgetown Law’s strength 
as a leader in the field of legal edu-
cation. Congratulations to Georgetown 
University Law Center for this excep-
tional record. I have full confidence 
that Georgetown Law will continue to 
shape future leaders for years to come, 
preparing them to address the myriad 
challenges our society faces and to 
fight for justice for every person and 
every community. 
Dean William Treanor does a superb 
job of leadership, and we often speak of 
the inspiring path of the law center 
over so many decades. 
Georgetown University Law Center 
was featured in an article in the Wash-
ington Post late last year. I ask unani-
mous consent that the article titled, 
‘‘The 
country’s 
most 
popular 
law 
school got an unexpected jolt’’ be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, Nov. 13, 2021] 
THE COUNTRY’S MOST POPULAR LAW SCHOOL 
GOT AN UNEXPECTED JOLT 
(By Valerie Strauss) 
Year in and year out, the Georgetown Uni-
versity Law Center in D.C. gets more appli-
cations than any other law school in the 
country (and yes, that includes law schools 
at Harvard and Yale and Stanford). But what 
happened for the 2021–22 academic year was 
historic. 
Collectively, U.S. law schools this year saw 
an increase of at least 12 percent in appli-
cants for classes that started this fall and a 
26 percent jump in applications—the largest 
in nearly 20 years, according to the nonprofit 
Law School Admission Council. 
At Georgetown University Law Center, the 
increase was so high that is shocked George-
town law officials, who have become accus-
tomed to being the country’s most popular 
law school. The school saw a 41 percent in-
crease in applicants—for a total of 14,052. Of 
all law school applicants nationwide, 1 in 5 
applied to Georgetown. It is the largest law 
school in the country with some 2,000 stu-
dents in juris doctor degree (JD) programs, 
with Harvard second at some 1,750 JD stu-
dents. 
The rise in law school applications across 
the country—which left some law schools 
overenrolled this fall—was a result of several 
factors, said Susan Krinsky, executive vice 
president for operations and chief of staff at 
the Law School Admission Council. ‘‘I don’t 
like to call it a perfect storm, but it was,’’ 
she said. 
Fallout from the coronavirus pandemic 
played a big role, with economic uncertainty 
that traditionally fuels applications to pro-
fessional schools, she said. Many young peo-
ple lost their jobs and decided to give law 
school a chance. But a continuation of what 
is called ‘‘the Trump bump’’ was a factor 
too, she said. 
Law school applications began to rise after 
the 2016 presidential election, with President 
Donald Trump’s Muslim ban and immigra-
tion policies helping to fuel the increase, she 
said. What happened in 2020—including the 
police killing of George Floyd and the racial 
justice movement that arose from it— 
spurred more applicants, she said, as did the 
death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg and the confirmation of a con-
troversial successor. 
‘‘There was a generalized increase in inter-
est about what lawyers do—or can do,’’ she 
said. 
A 2020 survey by Kaplan Test Prep of more 
than 100 U.S. law schools found that 84 per-
cent of admissions officers (and 87 percent in 
a 2018 survey) believed that the political cli-
mate was a ‘‘significant’’ factor in the rise in 
applicants for that year—and that continued 
in the 2020–21 applications cycle. 
Why, though, did Georgetown University 
Law Center have such a huge rise in appli-
cants? 
‘‘I think it’s a combination of things,’’ said 
William M. Treanor, dean and executive vice 
president of Georgetown Law. ‘‘Washington, 
D.C., is a huge lure. It offers you things you 
can’t get anywhere else. And we have intern-
ships with lawmakers and policymakers and 
faculty engaged directly in the issues of the 
day.’’ 
Georgetown has a night school, joint de-
gree and advanced degree programs, an Of-
fice of Public Interest and Community Serv-
ice and it specializes in some of the hottest 
legal 
subjects—including 
environmental, 
health and international law. Its Human 
Rights Institute is a draw for students—and 
it attracts some big legal names. Now on the 
faculty, for example, is Doug Emhoff, the 
country’s first second gentleman (he is mar-
ried to Vice President Harris), a leading in-
tellectual property and business litigator 
and expert on entertainment and media law. 
Treanor said the political climate was an 
important factor in the surge of applications 
at Georgetown. He said he became interested 
in the law when he was in high school during 
a similarly contentious time in American 
political life—the Watergate era of the early 
1970s. President Richard Nixon was forced to 
resign after his administration was caught 
breaking the law. 
‘‘That was a period in which people were 
drawn to law school and the thought that 
law matters and the fight for justice can

have real consequences,’’ he said. ‘‘This has 
been a moment where we saw something 
similar, in politics, the divisions in society, 
the need for racial justice.’’ 
It’s what cemented Kamal Rattray’s deci-
sion to apply. The Bronx high school teacher 
said he had long wanted to become a lawyer, 
but he applied after his father, who had a 
green card, was deported to Jamaica by the 
Trump administration for reasons he still 
doesn’t understand. Rattray’s immigrant 
students feared the same thing could happen 
to their families, he said. 
‘‘All the deportations, without due process, 
that the Trump administration took full ad-
vantage of while further disenfranchising 
communities of color inspired me to go to 
law school,’’ he said. ‘‘I think we need more 
lawyers of color in order to hold accountable 
people with ideologies akin to the Trump ad-
ministration’s.’’ 
Rattray had four law schools to choose 
from—but Georgetown was a no-brainer, he 
said. ‘‘I really felt like there was consistent 
outreach from Georgetown while I was in the 
application process. I also liked that the 
school has a Black Law Students Associa-
tion, and there seems like there is a lot of 
camaraderie.’’ 
The school’s numbers are also attractive to 
applicants. Georgetown ranks in the top 10 
on the Princeton Review’s ranking of law 
schools for best classroom experience, and it 
has one of the lowest student-to-faculty ra-
tios in the country. Ninety to 95 percent of 
students graduate in three years, and more 
than 95 percent of its students pass the bar 
exam on their first attempt. Ninety percent 
of students who graduated in 2020 (the latest 
year for which there is data) were employed 
by the time they received their degree, and 
Georgetown Law is tied for highest median 
starting salary among graduates working in 
private practice as associates. 
Law school is expensive—and that’s true at 
Georgetown as well. For 2021–22, the cost of 
attending full-time is close to $100,000, the 
school’s website says, with $69,280 going to 
tuition. Seventy-eight percent of this year’s 
entering Georgetown Law class received 
scholarship aid of some sort. 
The outreach to applicants is led by An-
drew Cornblatt, the law school’s veteran 
dean of admissions. Cornblatt makes it a 
point to stay connected to students who 
come to campus, and is often stopped on 
campus by students who just want to say hi. 
‘‘Most people think of assembling a law 
school class as putting a puzzle together,’’ 
Cornblatt said. ‘‘For me it’s more like cre-
ating an orchestra with lots of different in-
struments, not just violins. I am always 
struck by how many talented, interesting, 
well-qualified applicants we receive from all 
over the world.’’ 
Working at home during the pandemic, he 
spent hours each day interviewing 2,700 ap-
plicants in small groups. Zoom allowed him 
to visit 50 states, 37 countries and six con-
tinents. 
‘‘We are looking for applicants who really 
want to do this and while we are happy to 
welcome college seniors, we also put great 
emphasis on work and life experience,’’ 
Cornblatt said. ‘‘Opera singers, veterans, 
class presidents, Fulbright scholars, football 
players, Hill staffers, people working in non-
profits fully committed to public service. 
For fall 2021, Georgetown enrolled 561 stu-
dents from 45 states and 17 foreign countries, 
an acceptance rate of 12.9 percent—down 
from 21 percent a year ago. It was also the 
most diverse first-year class—with 40 percent 
identifying as people of color, as compared 
with 32 percent the previous year. Of the 561, 
110 are Opportunity Scholars, which awards 
scholarships to students with the most sig-
nificant financial need and high academic 
credentials. Women constitute 54 percent of 
the class. 
Cornblatt played a key role in persuading 
Kathie Duperval, 24, to attend Georgetown. 
She was in the final stretch of applying to 
law school during the 2020 presidential elec-
tion after a tough year navigating the pan-
demic and, she said, Georgetown’s outreach 
sold her. 
‘‘Specifically, Dean Andy made a tremen-
dous effort to form connections with many 
students during the interview process,’’ she 
said. ‘‘Though virtual, he made sure to con-
nect with us, and he even went out of his 
way to send personalized videos to admitted 
students on a weekly basis.’’ 
For Elena Bacon, 22, the social justice 
movement that emerged from Floyd’s mur-
der changed her legal path. Once seeing her-
self as a corporate lawyer, she said she now 
plans to pursue a career in international 
human rights law so she can advocate for 
those being denied fundamental freedoms. 
Georgetown was always at the top of her list, 
she said, ‘‘because of the number of opportu-
nities it offers for experiential learning, its 
distinguished Human Rights Institute, and 
its location in Washington, DC.’’ 
Now, Cornblatt—a graduate of Harvard 
University and Boston College law school—is 
engrossed in leading his 31st admissions sea-
son as dean.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO GARY KELLY 
∑ Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want 
to recognize and congratulate Gary 
Kelly, the CEO of Southwest Airlines, 
as he hands over the reins of this great 
Texas-based company and transitions 
to a new role as executive chairman. 
Southwest is a remarkable success 
story 
that 
captures 
the 
spirit 
of 
Texas—bold, innovative, and unafraid 
to take risks, while also warm, hos-
pitable, and focused on people. Those 
words describe Southwest, and they 
equally describe the company’s devoted 
leader, Gary Kelly. 
Gary is a seventh-generation Texan 
who has served the people of Southwest 
in various capacities since 1986, includ-
ing nearly two decades as CEO. Look-
ing back on those years, it is incredible 
to recall the many storms Gary and 
the people of Southwest navigated— 
years of depressed travel demand fol-
lowing the September 11 attacks, the 
great recession, and now a global pan-
demic. Through it all, Gary provided 
steadfast leadership and support to the 
airline’s more than 56,000 employees 
and countless beloved customers. 
I’ve been proud to work with Gary 
and his incredible team over the years, 
most notably on the Payroll Support 
Program, which protected the jobs of 
airline employees during the most tur-
bulent days of the pandemic. Through-
out its 50-year history, Southwest has 
never laid off employees—a point of 
great pride for the airline’s people-fo-
cused CEO. It’s abundantly clear that 
the love flows both ways. I remember 
visiting Southwest’s headquarters in 
Dallas and seeing the admiration on 
employees’ faces as they spoke about 
their dedicated and talented leader. 
Congratulations to Gary Kelly on 
nearly two decades as the CEO of 
Southwest Airlines. As he transitions 
to a new leadership role, I have no 
doubt that he will build upon his leg-
acy of dedicated service to Southwest 
and its employees.∑

TRIBUTE TO LATONYA BARTON 
∑ Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the re-
markable life of Ms. LaTonya Barton, a 
military spouse who made tremendous 
contributions to veterans, especially 
veteran entrepreneurs, veteran-owned 
small businesses and service-disabled 
veteran-owned small businesses. 
Ms. Barton and her spouse, Mr. Tim-
othy Barton, a U.S. Army veteran, 
founded Kingdomware Technology, In-
corporation, in 1993. After several un-
successful responses to requests for 
proposals issued by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs—VA—Ms. 
Barton suspected that the Department 
was failing to comply with a statutory 
requirement known as the Rule of Two. 
Under this Federal law, VA contracting 
officers are required to restrict com-
petition to veteran-owned small busi-
nesses when it is reasonable to expect 
at least two veteran-owned small busi-
ness interests will compete for a given 
VA contract award. 
Ms. Barton’s legal challenge wove its 
way through the Federal judiciary 
until it reached the Supreme Court of 
the United States of America as the 
case Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. 
v. United States. Ms. Barton ulti-
mately prevailed in her case, as the Su-
preme Court issued a unanimous 8–0 
opinion which held that the Rule of 
Two is a mandatory legal requirement 
that applies to all VA competitive con-
tract awards, including orders on the 
Federal Supply Schedule. 
Ms. Barton’s legal victory was a sig-
nificant win for the rule of law and 
every veteran-owned small business in-
terest seeking to do business with the 
VA. Throughout her years of con-
ducting research for the litigation and 
testifying before Congress, Ms. Barton 
always kept faith in our justice system 
and remained steadfast in her deter-
mination to make sure veteran small 
business owners who served our Nation 
in uniform would benefit from laws en-
acted to help them do business with 
the VA. Ms. Barton will be remembered 
by colleagues as a pioneer business-
woman who was unwavering in her 
commitment to the principle that 
when American tax dollars are ex-
pended by the VA, veteran-owned small 
business interests must be empowered 
to compete with large private sector 
competitors. 
Of course, Ms. Barton was far more 
than a savvy businesswoman. She was 
also a devoted mother, mentor, friend, 
and patriot who was loved and re-
spected in her community. Despite the 
significant demands placed on her time 
by the litigation, Ms. Barton invested 
countless hours developing her chil-
dren’s academic and athletic prowess.

The fruits of her labor resulted in de-
veloping a successful veteran-owned 
small business that has lasted more 
than 20 years and three outstanding 
student-athletes who excel in the class-
room and on the basketball court. 
Ms. Barton passed away unexpectedly 
on November 3, 2021, leaving behind a 
legacy for veteran entrepreneurs across 
our Nation. She will always be remem-
bered for her tenacity and dedication 
to doing right by our country’s vet-

feat, possessed a never-quit attitude, 
and never gave up on the mission or 
her team. 
Ms. Barton leaves behind her hus-

Timothy, Jr., Carolae, and Johnathan. 
May her service, legacy and kind spirit 
serve as an inspiration to all.∑

RECOGNIZING OLIVE YOU 
BOUTIQUE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Olive You 
Boutique of Richmond, KY, as the Sen-
ate Small Business of the Week. 
Nearly a decade ago, Katie Stallons 
and her sister Lindsay Wiley decided 
there were not enough clothing options 
for the ladies of central Kentucky. The 
sisters, both Richmond natives and 
alumni of University of Kentucky, de-
cided to take matters into their own 
hands and open Olive You Boutique. 
Their mother, Jennifer Brandenburg, 
joined in their venture, designing the 
interior of the boutique, and now work-
ing in-store alongside her daughters 
and the other lovely ladies at Olive 
You Boutique. In their 9 and a half 
years of operating, this woman and 
family-owned business has seen plenty 
of growth and success. In 2015, they re-
ceived the Richmond Chamber of Com-
merce Minority Business of the Year 
Award, and they are routinely voted as 
Best Women’s Shopping in Richmond 
in local publications. Despite all this 
success, they have never lost sight of 
their mission. 
Owner Katie Stallons’ fundamental 
goal for Olive You Boutique is to carry 
something for ‘‘all of you’’ lovely 
women of central Kentucky and be-
yond. The store offers clothes to 
women of all ages; one stop shopping 
for 
daughter, 
mother, 
and 
grand-
mother, during all seasons. Olive You 
Boutique carries a wide range of items 
from casual loungewear to cocktail at-
tire and everything in between. Re-
gardless of age, shape, likes, and dis-
likes, Olive You Boutique has some-
thing for every woman. Customers are 
known to travel from all over Ken-
tucky and beyond, with the store offer-
ing items for every Bluegrass activity, 
whether it be Keeneland, Kentucky 
Derby, weddings, graduations, Easter, 
and more. 
Small businesses often have a very 
familial atmosphere, and Olive You 
Boutique is no exception. Whether you 
are greeted by one of the sisters in 
charge, their delightful mother and in-
terior designer, or one of the other 
charismatic women working alongside 
them, customers instantly feel like 
they are at home. Without a doubt, 
Olive You has brought a fun and per-
sonal shopping experience to the Blue-
grass State. From unique clothes to 
sweet gifts for any occasion, ‘‘all of 
you’’ can be sure to find something spe-
cial when shopping at Olive You Bou-
tique. 
The owners of the store keep both 
feet on the ground when conducting 
business and always look out for 
friends and neighbors. Often hosting 
‘‘Shop For a Cause’’ events in their 
store, they most recently teamed up 
with jewelry designer Kendra Scott and 
raised $1,000, which was matched by the 
designer, and then donated towards the 
medical journey of a Centre College 
student who had suffered a horrific spi-
nal cord injury. Their caring spirit ex-
tends even beyond the Kentucky com-
munity. In 2013, during the week fol-
lowing the category five tornado that 
struck Moore, OK, the owners of Olive 
You Boutique donated 10 percent of all 
sales to the American Red Cross Okla-
homa Disaster Relief Fund. 
In keeping their community in mind, 
Katie and Lindsay do not forget about 
other small businesses. Olive You Bou-
tique is often the source of gatherings, 
with the owners inviting weekly food 
trucks to come offer breakfast or lunch 
to their customers. They also host 
trunk shows where they invite food 
vendors, florists, and other local arti-
sans to come and sell their products 
alongside those found at Olive You. 
And if it is not a trunk show, it is a fun 
seasonal event to take advantage of 
community good cheer, often hosting 
summer 
soirees 
and 
other 
events 
around the winter holidays. 
Katie and Lindsay are two entre-
preneurs who demonstrate the best val-
ues of a small business owner. Olive 
You Boutique is not just a women’s 
clothing store, it is a site that fosters 
community involvement and outreach. 
It is a fun and friendly place where la-
dies can shop, where vendors can col-
laborate and where you can find local 
support and always a friendly face. 
Congratulations to Katie Stallons and 
Lindsay Wiley and the entire Olive You 
team. I wish them the best of luck and 
look forward to watching their contin-
ued growth and success in Kentucky.∑

RECOGNIZING POWELL VALLEY 
MILLWORK 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Powell Val-
ley Millwork of Clay City, KY, as the 
Senate Small Business of the Week. 
Twenty-seven years ago Jim Thorn-
berry and his son Jimmy left the min-
ing industry behind in search of a new 
venture. Shortly thereafter, Powell 
Valley Mill work was founded. The 
Thornberrys started their mill with the 
desire to harvest a tangible product 
within a sustainable industry, and that 
mission has stayed at the heart of their 
business throughout their decades of 
growth and success. 
The talent and substance of Powell 
Valley Mill work draws directly from 
our State, with the mill focusing on 
only one species of lumber: poplar. As 
the State tree of Kentucky, poplar is 
an abundant resource within Appa-
lachia, which makes their location in 
rural Clay City a prime spot for their 
operation. Often referred to as ‘‘the 
painter’s wood’’ poplar is known for its 
clear grain, smooth milling, and paint- 
taking qualities. The versatile and fine 
nature of the wood allows Powell Val-
ley Millwork to supply consumers with 
a wide variety of interior-trim prod-
ucts, such as stretcher bars, door and 
window jambs, stair parts, cabinetry 
components, primed finger-joint inte-
rior trim, and more. In creating all 
these products, the Powell Valley mill-
workers make sure nothing goes to 
waste. Poplar can be safely used as ani-
mal bedding which means the mill’s 
offcuts, those that are not already 
being used to fuel the company’s wood 
drying kilns, are turned into shavings. 
These shavings are then bagged and 
shipped out by the truck load to be 
sold in a wide variety of retail outlets. 
This Powell County mill maintains 
their technology at a topnotch stand-
ard. In 2019, the owners invested in a 
new addition to the team: a sophisti-
cated scanning rough mill line from 
Eagle Machinery & Supply, Inc. The 
new rough mill line is able to process 
65,000 board feet of lumber in a single 8- 
hour shift with only six people required 
to operate it. The joint project between 
Powell and Eagle, both family compa-
nies, demonstrates that U.S. machin-
ery manufacturers can successfully 
compete with Europeans in providing 
world-class technology to the North 
American wood processing industry. 
The Thornberrys keep their eye on 
efficiency and progress, opening up 
ownership of the company to experts 
outside the family, including Dale 
Budke, 
Powell 
Valley’s 
Operations 
Manager. As a partner in this com-
pany, Dale provides the expertise nec-
essary for navigating the growing Ken-
tucky lumber industry. In 2019, Powell 
Valley Millwork acquired the Metrie 
Poplar manufacturing facility in near-
by Jeffersonville, KY. With a new 
125,000-square-foot 
location 
only 
12 
miles from their original facility, the 
two locations utilize their natural 
synergies to support the needs of a di-
verse 
customer 
base

beautiful natural resources and em-
ploying over 200 local men and women, 
this business illustrates some of the 
best qualities Kentucky has to offer: 
fine craftsmanship and dedicated hard 
work. Powell Valley Millwork is a dec-
ades-old dream the Thornberrys had 
when they left the mining industry, a 
dream that has grown beyond what 
they had imagined. Small businesses 
like Powell Valley are the core of 
small towns across Kentucky, and like 
the poplars they use in their mill, their 
roots grow deep to help our commu-
nities flourish. Congratulations to the 
Thomberrys and the entire Powell Val-
ley team. I wish them the best of luck 
and look forward to watching their 
continued growth and success in Ken-
tucky.∑

RECOGNIZING THE BYU WOMEN’S 
SOCCER SEASON 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the outstanding 
achievements of the Brigham Young 
University women’s soccer team. This 
past season, the team closed out a 
record-breaking year, culminating in 
their first ever contest for the NCAA 
Division One Women’s College Cup on 
December 6, 2021. 
Although the final match did not end 
in victory, the Cougars displayed ex-
traordinary determination and tenac-
ity in the championship game against 
Florida State University. During the 
entirety of regulation play, followed by 
two overtime periods, the BYU wom-
en’s soccer team denied every goal at-
tempt by their No. 1 ranked opponents. 
Only after an exhaustive overtime did 
the squad fall just short in penalty 
kicks, during which the victors are ul-
timately decided by a great deal of 
luck. 
Despite this heartbreaking final re-
sult, the women achieved historic suc-
cesses. Tallying 77 points during the 
season, the team led the country in 
overall goals and was the top scoring 
offense in the Nation, averaging 3.5 
goals per game. They also led the Na-
tion with 226 corner kicks, rounding 
out 
their 
impressive 
18–5-1 
season 
record. 
Veteran coach Jennifer Rockwood 
has led the BYU soccer program to a 
total of 22 NCAA tournament appear-
ances in her 27 years of coaching, a re-
markably impressive record. For their 
efforts, BYU’s staff, including Rock-
wood, Brent Anderson, Steve Magleby, 
Madie Gates, Rachel Jorgensen, and 
Carolyn Billings, all earned United 
Soccer Coaches’ 2021 West Regional 
Staff of the Year awards and the NCAA 
DI Women’s Staff of the Year award. 
While the entire team had an exem-
plary season, individual players re-
ceived numerous accolades. Mikayla 
Colohan was named a finalist for both 
the Class of 2022 Honda Sport Award for 
Soccer and the 2021 MAC Hermann Tro-
phy. Additionally, forward Cameron 
Tucker signed a 2-year deal with 
Gotham FC of the National Women’s 
Soccer League upon graduation. 
Individual performances and acco-
lades are built on the strong founda-
tion of a great team. BYU’s impressive 
team includes seniors Grace Johnson 
and Makaylie Moore, juniors Ashton 
Johnson and Natalee Wells, and sopho-
mores Bella Folino, Zoe Jacobs, Ellie 
Maughan, Rachel McCarthy, Becken 
Mozingo, 
Kendell 
Petersen, 
Jamie 
Shepherd, Laveni Vaka, and Olivia 
Wade. Rounding out the team were 
freshmen 
Haven 
Empey, 
Savannah 
Empey-Mason, Paola Garcia, Addie 
Gardner, Brooke Hale, Ruby Lladek, 
Kelsey Hoopes, Abbie Kotter, Josie 
Shepherd, 
Olivia 
Smith, 
Caroline 
Stringfellow, Daviana Vaka, Tara War-
ner, and Jacey Wood. 
Congratulations to the entire BYU 
women’s soccer program for their his-
toric season. I wish them the best of 
luck in their continued athletic, aca-
demic, and professional pursuits.∑

503—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
THE 
GOVERN-
MENT OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUB-
LIC OF CHINA SHOULD IMME-
DIATELY 
GUARANTEE 
THE 
SAFETY AND FREEDOM OF TEN-
NIS STAR PENG SHUAI 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. WARNER, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. BROWN, 
Mr. HOEVEN, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. CRUZ, Mr. 
MERKLEY, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, 
Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. CASEY, Mr. COT-
TON, Mr. WARNOCK, Mr. JOHNSON, and 
Mrs. SHAHEEN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 503 
Whereas, on November 2, 2021, 3-time 
Olympian Peng Shuai went missing after she 
said in a since-deleted post on Chinese social 
media site Weibo that she had been sexually 
assaulted and forced into a sexual relation-
ship with Zhang Gaoli, who was the senior 
Vice Premier of the State Council of the 
People’s Republic of China from 2013 to 2018; 
Whereas authorities of the People’s Repub-
lic of China imposed a media and internet 
blackout of discussions of Peng’s case; 
Whereas, on November 14, 2021, after Peng 
had not been seen or heard from for 12 days, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the 
Women’s Tennis Association Steve Simon re-
quested a ‘‘full, fair, and transparent’’ inves-
tigation into Peng’s allegations; 
Whereas 
the 
hashtag 
‘‘#WhereIsPengShuai’’ trended across social 
media worldwide, with the exception of the 
People’s Republic of China where it was 
censored; 
Whereas, on November 17, 2021, the Wom-
en’s Tennis Association received a statement 
purporting to be from Peng, recanting her 
abuse claim and saying ‘‘everything is fine’’; 
Whereas, in response, Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer of the Women’s Tennis As-
sociation Steve Simon said the statement 
‘‘released today by Chinese state media con-
cerning Peng Shuai only raises my concerns 
as to her safety and whereabouts’’; 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee said in a statement that it was ‘‘en-
couraged by assurances that she is safe’’; 
Whereas, on November 19 and 20, 2021, 
photos and videos of Peng appearing in her 
home, in a restaurant, and at a youth tennis 
event in Beijing emerged on Twitter ac-
counts 
affiliated 
with 
government-run 
media; 
Whereas, on November 19, 2021, White 
House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the 
White House is ‘‘deeply concerned’’ over 
Peng’s 
disappearance 
and 
seeks 
‘‘inde-
pendent and verifiable proof’’ of her location 
and condition; 
Whereas, 
on 
November 
19, 
2021, 
Liz 
Throssell, the spokesperson for the United 
Nations 
High 
Commissioner 
for 
Human 
Rights, told reporters ‘‘. . . it would be im-
portant to have proof of her whereabouts and 
wellbeing, and we would urge that there be 
an investigation with full transparency into 
her allegations of sexual assault’’; 
Whereas, on November 21, 2021, the Inter-
national Olympic Committee said in a state-
ment that its President, Thomas Bach, had a 
30-minute video call with Peng, joined by a 
Chinese sports official and an official of the 
International Olympic Committee; 
Whereas the statement said that, during 
the call, Peng appeared to be ‘‘doing fine’’ 
and appeared ‘‘relaxed’’, and said she ‘‘would 
like to have her privacy respected’’; 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee did not explain how the video call 
with Peng had been organized, given the dif-
ficulties other concerned parties have had 
reaching her; 
Whereas, on November 30, 2021, in an inter-
view with CNN, International Olympic Com-
mittee official Dick Pound defended the han-
dling of the situation by the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China and said the 
‘‘unanimous conclusion’’ by International 
Olympic Committee officials on the call is 
that Peng Shuai is ‘‘fine’’; 
Whereas the annual report of the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China for 
2020 finds that gender-based violence in 
China remains a serious issue, and highly 
publicized cases of sexual assault continue to 
surface; 
Whereas, on December 1, 2021, the Women’s 
Tennis Association suspended all Women’s 
Tennis Association tournaments in China 
and Hong Kong; 
Whereas Chairman and Chief Executive Of-
ficer of the Women’s Tennis Association 
Steve Simon stated, ‘‘In good conscience, I 
don’t see how I can ask our athletes to com-
pete there when Peng Shuai is not allowed to 
communicate freely and has seemingly been 
pressured to contradict her allegation of sex-
ual assault. Given the current state of af-
fairs, I am also greatly concerned about the 
risks that all of our players and staff could 
face if we were to hold events in China in 
2022.’’; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China has repeatedly detained 
‘‘#MeToo’’ activists in China and censored 
online and public discussion around sexual 
assault and harassment; and 
Whereas athletes from the around the 
world will be competing in the 2022 Winter 
Olympic Games in Beijing in February 2022: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the case of Peng Shuai is directly re-
lated to broader international concerns 
around the freedom of speech and safety of 
athletes participating in the 2022 Winter 
Olympic Games in Beijing; 
(2) the failure of the International Olympic 
Committee to clearly and forcefully chal-
lenge the claims of the Government of the 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China 
concerning 
Peng’s safety raise questions about the abil-
ity and willingness of the International 
Olympic Committee to stand up for the 
human rights of athletes participating in the 
2022 Olympic and Paralympic games in Bei-
jing; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China would help reduce concerns 
about athlete safety at the 2022 Winter 
Olympic Games in Beijing by assuring Peng’s 
freedom and safety and investigating her al-
legations in a fair and transparent manner; 
(4) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China should immediately take steps 
to— 
(A) provide independent and verifiable 
proof of Peng’s whereabouts and that she is 
safe; 
(B) allow Peng to engage directly with the 
Women’s Tennis Association and the United 
Nations to independently verify her safety 
and explain her absence from public life 
since making her allegation; 
(C) open an independent and transparent 
investigation into Peng’s allegations against 
former senior Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli; 
(D) publicly commit to hold sexual vio-
lence abusers accountable; 
(E) cease all censorship of reporting and 
discussions of Peng’s case; and 
(F) allow Peng to leave China if she so de-
sires and prevent any retaliation against 
family members remaining there; 
(5) by failing to clearly and forcefully chal-
lenge the Chinese Communist Party’s nar-
rative, the International Olympic Com-
mittee has failed to uphold its own stated 
commitments with regard to ‘‘[r]espect for 
international 
conventions 
on 
protecting 
human rights’’, as outlined in the Code of 
Ethics of the International Olympic Com-
mittee; 
(6) the conduct of the International Olym-
pic Committee runs counter to efforts by the 
United States Government, human rights or-
ganizations, the Women’s Tennis Associa-
tion, and other international bodies and indi-
viduals to secure Peng’s safety; and 
(7) in an effort to regain lost public con-
fidence, the International Olympic Com-
mittee should publicly call on the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China to 
undertake the actions called for in para-
graph (4).

HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the pleasure of presenting Scott 
Roscoe with his Eagle Scout Court of Honor. 
Scott is a member of Egg Harbor Township 
Troop 94. For his Eagle Scout Project, he in-
stalled a wall-mounted shelving system in the 
offices of the Great Egg Harbor Township His-
torical Society. For this project, Scott arranged 
the material donations and volunteers, com-
municated with the historical society, and ar-
ranged meetings with groups and individuals 
to ensure the completion of the project. He 
also volunteered around 110 service hours at 
the ALS Walk, Food Bank, Salvation Army, 
Patcong Creek, Beach Cleanup, and more. 
Scott, along with his brother Jack, also helped 
organize and sell flood-relief buckets to aid 
Texans affected by Hurricane Harvey. This 
young man should be proud of his accom-
plishments, and it was my honor to have the 
opportunity to recognize him for his service to 
both the Historical Society and the entire 
South Jersey community. God Bless Scott and 
God Bless America.

LEXI MISSIMO 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor our Texas 24 Hometown Hero 
of the week, Lexi Missimo, a Southlake native 
representing the United States Women’s Na-
tional youth team. 
Last season while playing for the University 
of Texas, Lexi showed courage in the face of 
public pressure by standing proudly for our 
country’s national anthem. While many chose 
to bend the knee, Lexi stood with pride to 
honor the country she loves, and her beloved 
late grandfather who selflessly served in the 
military. 
We live in strange times—it is now more ac-
ceptable to kneel for our flag than to stand. 
Lexi displayed bravery by refusing to cower to 
public pressure, not for any political purpose, 
but simply out of love for country. 
Lexi is an all-American kid—one who is 
proud of the country she calls home and those 
who serve to protect it. I look forward to see-
ing her represent our country this summer with 
the Under 20’s national team, and one day, 
fulfill her dream to play for the senior team. 
I thank Lexi for her courageous actions. 
May they inspire the rest of the country to 
show pride in our great Nation. 
RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE ORGANIZATION OF 
THE 1ST MISSION SUPPORT COM-
MAND OF THE UNITED STATES 
ARMY RESERVE IN PUERTO RICO 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I would like to give special recognition to the 
Organized Reserve in Puerto Rico known as 
the 1st Mission Support Command. 
In June 1922, the Organized Reserve in 
Puerto Rico was authorized when the Head-
quarters of the 187th Infantry Brigade and the 
373rd Infantry Regiment were allotted from the 
National Army. This force, transformed by the 
needs of the nation continues to serve today 
as the 1st Mission Support Command. As we 
approach the 100th anniversary of its organi-
zation it is befitting to pause to commemorate 
and recognize the contributions of its veterans 
and continuing contributions of its soldiers to 
vital national security interests and homeland 
defense. 
Answering the nation’s call when liberty is at 
risk is a responsibility that the citizen soldiers 
from the newly Organized Reserve in Puerto 
Rico readily assumed. From July 14, 1939 to 
July 7, 1945, 119 enlisted and 513 officers 
from the Organized Reserve in Puerto Rico 
served in World War II. During the decade of 
the 1940s the Organized Reserve in Puerto 
Rico were designated the Army Reserve in 
Puerto Rico. Subsequent military priorities 
adapted, expanded, and amended the organi-
zation of the Army Reserve in Puerto Rico to 
include additional military occupational special-
ties, capabilities and responsibility for units in 
the Virgin Islands. Its current denomination as 
1st Mission Support Command was authorized 
on October 19, 2007. 
These changes enabled the Army Reserve 
in Puerto Rico to activate and deploy from 
September 1990 through October 1991, more 
than 1,000 Soldiers in support of the Persian 
Gulf War. After the events of September 11, 
2001, the 1st Mission Support Command de-
ployed more than 5,000 soldiers to provide in-
dispensable and sustained support for oper-
ations Enduring Freedom, Noble Eagle, Iraqi 
Freedom, and other throughout the world, with 
95 percent of units having deployed or pro-
vided mobilized soldiers, in support of the 
Global War on Terrorism. 
The commitment of the members of the 1st 
Mission Support Command and their success 
wherever they deploy is a demonstration of 
their quality and devotion to duty. But behind 
each of them are the family members who 
support them with their love and who endure 
the long periods of separation spent in training 
and deployments. This 100th anniversary is 
also a celebration of their stoic support. 
Confronting overseas threats is where the 
1st Mission Support Command has earned its 
reputation as a professional and capable 
force. But probably the greatest threat con-
fronted by the command was not in a remote 
battlefield, but in its own backyard. The bat-
tering winds of Hurricane Irma and Maria in 
2017 impacted Puerto Rico with such a force 
that within a few hours transformed our be-
loved Island into a disaster zone. The severity 
of the Island-wide disaster required desig-
nating the 1st Mission Support Command as 
the U.S. Army Reserve Caribbean Geo-
graphical Command, which added key new 
capabilities to its formation and placing thou-
sands of additional soldiers, under one chain 
of command. It is evidence of the quality of 
leadership and soldiers who are part of the 1st 
Mission Support Command that even when 
faced with the emergency imposed by the dis-
aster, they gallantly helped their communities 
while effectively continuing to support their 
military commitments overseas. 
As the 1st Mission Support Command in 
Puerto Rico stands in the threshold of a new 
century, we are confident that the strong roots 
developed during the last 100 years have pre-
pared the men and woman of this command 
to respond to the challenges that war, or na-
ture could bring in the future. Is in this context 
that I request that this body joins with me to 
recognize and commend the 1st Mission Com-
mand for the selfless and dedicated service of 
its past and present citizen-soldiers whose 
personal courage, contributions, and sacrifices 
have helped preserve the freedom and ad-
vance the national security and homeland de-
fense of the United States of America.

BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NIKEMA WILLIAMS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 2022 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I urge support for my amendment to bol-
ster the research capacity of our Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), 
Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and 
Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). 
I’m a third generation HBCU graduate. 
HBCUs were created to provide a safe place 
of learning for Black Americans. Just this 
week, that most basic tenet has been threat-
ened by racist bomb threats. 
On Tuesday, I called on the Department of 
Education to lead a whole-of-government re-
sponse to these threats. We owe HBCU stu-
dents and faculty safety, but we also owe 
them so much more. 
I’m here today to ensure Congress delivers 
for our HBCUs the same way they delivered 
for me and so many other graduates. My 
amendment will bolster the research capacity 
of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in two ways. 
First, it will ensure that research grants from 
the National Science Foundation can be used 
for 
the 
professional 
development

mentorship of student and faculty researchers 
at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs. Second, it will 
make sure federal agencies provide technical 
assistance to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs on 
how to grow their capacity to manage grants 
from application to completion. 
As the representative of the congressional 
district with the greatest number of HBCUs, I 
know investing in HBCUs supports Black ex-
cellence. My amendment will support critical 
educational institutions and their students, ad-
vance innovation, and grow our economy. I 
urge my colleagues to support its passage.

BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to speak on amendment number 150 spon-
sored by Representative MIKE LEVIN. 
This amendment is modeled off the Public 
Land Renewable Energy Development Act 
(PLREDA) which promotes wind, solar, and 
geothermal resources on public lands. 
You might ask me why I am speaking on a 
Democrat amendment, or why I seem to know 
so much about this amendment. 
It’s strange because this amendment looks 
familiar to me. I wonder why that is? 
Oh that’s right, that’s because PLREDA is 
my bill, one which I have sponsored since the 
112th Congress. 
When I introduced PLREDA in the previous 
Congresses, I solicited original cosponsors in 
a bipartisan manner. 
Mr. LEVIN was one such original cosponsor. 
After the 2020 election, we used Mr. LEVIN 
as the lead, yet with this current legislation I 
was prohibited from being part of its annual 
original sponsors. 
But that’s fine, I am more interested in pass-
ing good governance for the American people 
than demanding the credit. 
I have done this in the past when we re-
formed 
the 
antitrust 
exemptions 
in 
the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act for the medical insur-
ance industry and brought knowledge to the 
erroneous administrative exclusion in the Ra-
diation Exposure Compensation Act jeopard-
izing constituents in Mohave County, Arizona 
and Clark County, Nevada. 
If this were a stand-alone provision, it would 
earn my support because we need to pass the 
remainder of PLREDA, the rest which I was 
unable to get passed in previous Congresses. 
However, used as an amendment to a very 
disingenuous bill, I cannot support it. Not be-
cause of the theft of my bill but the poor proc-
ess used today in this bad bill. 
I’ve always said good process builds good 
policy which makes good politics. 
The amendments being considered inside 
en bloc packages is a tactic of the current ma-
jority which would make the founders roll in 
their graves. 
This is not a counter China bill. This bill pro-
motes a role for the government in the econ-
omy which is un-American and deals more in 
abstract social and climate policies than any-
thing else. 
It is not good process. Everyone on the 
other side has not read the full bill, just like 
they have not taken the time to make them-
selves fully aware of anything they have 
passed so far, regardless if it’s a bill, amend-
ment, or resolution. 
The American people should be concerned 
about how this bill actually makes us weaker 
in the face of China, and no matter how many 
of my good policy ideas you add to it in the 
form of an amendment, you cannot change its 
rotten core.

CASEL’S MARKETPLACE 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the pleasure of visiting Casel’s 
Marketplace, 
a 
family-owned 
market 
in 
Margate, South Jersey. Since opening its 
doors as a small grocery store in Atlantic City 
in 1929, Casel’s has brought the finest quality 
ingredients to the South Jersey community. 
This year marks the 40th anniversary of the 
Sieden family owning Casel’s Marketplace. 
Throughout the years, Casel’s has continued 
to turn new visitors into life-long customers. 
They are known for their signature meats, 
smoked fish department, grab-and-go salads, 
extensive cheese selection, and fresh produce 
section. Casel’s Marketplace is always doing 
everything necessary to give their customers’ 
the best shopping experience. God Bless the 
Sieden Family and Ceasel’s Marketplace and 
God Bless America.

HONORING ANNE BACON AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Anne Bacon, Chief Executive 
Officer of IMPACT Community Action Partner-
ship. 
Anne Bacon and her team at IMPACT have 
been essential in helping Iowans keep a roof 
over their heads throughout the COVID–19 
pandemic and supporting Iowans in need. So 
much of what we do here in Congress relies 
on the work of public servants and commu-
nities to implement. and their work has been 
especially critical over the last two years. IM-
PACT has been serving Iowans for years. but 
they took on new challenges during the pan-
demic. 
Recognizing the importance of keeping 
Iowans housed during the pandemic, IMPACT 
helped more than 1,000 families with direct 
housing assistance during 2020, using funding 
from the CARES Act. This year, working with 
Polk County and Des Moines, Anne’s team 
has kept more than 6,500 households from 
facing eviction and homelessness, committing 
more than $35 million from the Emergency 
Rental Assistance Program Congress passed 
in the last year. That includes families with 
nearly 7,000 children who were able to keep 
the homes they knew thanks to the efforts of 
Anne and IMPACT. Their work also received 
praise from the Treasury Department as a 
high-performing program for making their pro-
gram easy to use and working directly to help 
renters facing eviction. 
Anne grew up in Toledo, Iowa, and after liv-
ing in California for four years moved back to 
Iowa to commit her life to making sure that our 
social safety net would work for people going 
through tough times. That goal—making sure 
people could access services and leave feel-
ing better than when they started—has driven 
her in getting her degree in Social Work from 
the University of Iowa and a Masters in Public 
Administration from Drake University, and con-
tinues to drive her work to reduce the barriers 
that people in poverty face. Anne’s work at IM-
PACT includes both direct service to Iowans 
and looking at the systemic issues that create 
this kind of need in the US, and focuses on 
making sure that programs to help people 
need to recognize that the people they’re help-
ing are their most important stakeholders. 
Anne now lives in Ankeny and is happily 
married with three adult children and one 
grandson. 
Anne’s dedication to helping others sets an 
example all of us can look to, and the work of 
Iowans like her is critical to making sure the 
work we do here in Congress reaches our 
constituents. My work on the Financial Serv-
ices Committee to secure rental assistance to 
help Iowans recover from the impacts of the 
pandemic relies on dedicated public servants 
like Anne. I’m forever grateful for her work 
during this difficult time, and I will continue to 
work in Congress, as I did at the State of 
Iowa, to make sure that government truly 
works for the people. It is my privilege to rec-
ognize Anne Bacon as Iowan of the Week.

RECOGNIZING THE 34TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
SUMGAIT 
PO-
GROMS 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to condemn the violence inflicted 
upon Armenians on the 34th anniversary of 
the Sumgait Pogroms in Azerbaijan. I believe 
that condemning these actions today will help 
prevent renewed aggression against citizens 
of Armenian descent who continue to live in 
Azerbaijan, while bringing attention to efforts 
to erase these atrocities from our collective 
memory. Further, I reaffirm our nation’s com-
mitment to an enduring, peaceful, and demo-
cratic resolution of the Artsakh conflict. 
From 1988 to 1990, the Armenian popu-
lation in Soviet Azerbaijan was the target of 
ethnically targeted pogroms in the cities of 
Sumgait, Kirovabad, and Baku. Beginning on 
February 27, 1988 in Sumgait, Armenian 
Christians were indiscriminately murdered, 
raped, and maimed by mobs of criminals and 
thugs. According to independent reporting, po-
lice in Baku allowed the pogroms to continue 
for 3 days, during which lime Armenians were 
burned alive and thrown from windows, 
Despite vocal U.S. and international protests 
over the Sumgait Pogroms, renewed anti-Ar-
menian pogroms were launched in Kirovabad 
on November 21, 1988 that lasted for seven 
days. Fourteen months later in the capital,

Baku, another pogrom was launched against 
its Armenian minority. These vicious attacks 
killed hundreds of unarmed civilians and dis-
placed tens of thousands of Armenians fleeing 
systematic violence as refugees. 
These pogroms set the stage for decades of 
aggression by Azerbaijan. In September 2020, 
Azerbaijan bombed the Republic of Artsakh 
with Turkish support, targeting Armenian 
schools and religious sites, and killing inno-
cent civilians. Over a year later, Azerbaijan 
still illegally holds and tortures Armenian pris-
oners of war (POWs) from 2020, despite sign-
ing a joint statement requiring all captives to 
be released. 
Madam Speaker, on this 34th anniversary of 
the Sumgait Pogroms, I want to emphasize 
the importance of remembering these crimes 
against humanity. I call on the Azerbaijani 
government to acknowledge that these atroc-
ities occurred, and that it seeks justice for the 
victims by prosecuting those who committed 
these horrific acts of violence. I also call upon 
the government of Azerbaijan to take all ap-
propriate action to prevent further tragedies of 
this nature, and to respect the rights of all mi-
norities living within its borders. I condemn 
Azerbaijan’s ongoing aggression against Ar-
menia, and call on the Azerbaijani government 
to immediately and unconditionally release all 
Armenian POWs and captive civilians.

Francis’ love for animals and insects was 
exemplified by the impressive community serv-
ice project he led in lake La Plata in Toa Baja. 
Francis and his team renovated the pollination 
garden at the wildlife refuge by installing sev-
eral beehive boxes, and signs showcasing 
educative material about pollinator species 
most common in the area. 
Francis is part of the special needs program 
of the Boy Scouts of America, and his story is 
an extraordinary example for youth with spe-
cial needs around the Nation.

complishment, recognizing the outstanding ef-
forts of his work.

ROSALIE GRENON 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the late Rosalie Grenon of Sut-
ton, Massachusetts, a loving mother, grand-
mother, and friend to many. 
Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, Rosalie 
spent her entire life in Central Massachusetts, 
growing up and raising her family in Millbury 
and Sutton, respectively. She married her high 
school sweetheart, David Grenon, and they 
built a beautiful family and life together. Driven 
by their belief in the importance of education, 
Rosalie and David have a long history of sup-
porting the business studies program at As-
sumption University in Worcester, MA. 
Rosalie was actively involved in her commu-
nity, and a true patron of the arts. She served 
on the Advisory Board of the Joy of Music in 
Worcester, the Scholarship Committee for the 
Greater Worcester Community Foundation, 
and the Advisory Board for the Performing 
Arts School of Worcester. 
A graduate of Anna Maria College in 
Paxton, Massachusetts, Rosalie received a 
degree in music from the college in 1960. She 
was a talented opera singer and had a par-
ticular adoration for classical music. A skilled 
artist, she found joy in photography, painting, 
and drawing. She often used her talents to 
contribute to her church and events in our 
community. 
Rosalie loved the many roles she held in 
her life, but she cherished being a grand-
mother and great-grandmother the most. She 
had magical connections with the children in 
her life, and she often spent her time playing 
with them and rocking them to sleep with 
ease. 
Rosalie was a vibrant woman who put an 
abundance of love out into the world. She will 
be remembered for her artistic eye, her dedi-
cation to her family, and her love of Barry 
Manilow’s music. Her kindness and passion 
extended beyond herself and touched the peo-
ple who loved her in unforgettable ways. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress and Rosalie’s loved ones, it 
is my great privilege and honor to celebrate 
and recognize the beautiful life of the late Ro-
salie Grenon.

Jack has been a scout for eight years and is

own vegetables. In addition to this project, he 
has also volunteered 120 hours of community 
service, including the ALS walk, Salvation 
Army, and Dog Park and Beach Clean Up.

ture endeavors. God Bless Jack and God

IN HONOR OF COACH KIRBY PAUL 
SMART 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor, commend, and extend 
personal congratulations to the University of 
Georgia’s (UGA) Football Head Coach, Coach 
Kirby P. Smart. Coach Smart recently led the 
UGA Bulldogs to their 2022 College Football 
Playoffs National Championship win on Mon-
day, January 11, 2022. 
Kirby was born on December 23, 1975, to 
the union of Sonny and Sharon Smart. He 
was educated in the Decatur County School 
System, and he began his playing career at 
Bainbridge High School under the tutelage of 
his father. During his high school career, he 
was a three-year letterman in football, basket-
ball, and baseball and a first-team Class 
AAAA All-State as a senior. Upon his gradua-
tion from Bainbridge High, he enrolled at and 
played for the University of Georgia, where he 
was a four-year letterman at defensive back 
and a first-team All-SEC (Southeastern Con-
ference) selection as a senior. He finished his 
college football career as a four-time member 
of SEC Academic Honor Roll, with 13 inter-
ceptions, ranking fourth-all time at UGA, and 
led the Bulldogs with six interceptions in 1997 
and five in 1998 before graduating in 1999 
with a bachelor’s degree in Finance. Kirby 
later obtained his master’s degree in Physical 
Education from Florida State University in 
2003. 
Kirby began his impressive coaching career 
in 1999 as the Administrative Assistant Coach 
for UGA. Since then, he has served as the As-
sistant Coach for Defensive Backs (2000) and 
Defense Coordinator (2001) at Valdosta State 
University, 
a 
Graduate 
Assistant 
(2002 
through 2003) at Florida State University, the 
Assistant Coach for Defensive Backs (2004) at 
Louisiana State University, the Assistant 
Coach for Running Backs (2005) at UGA, and

sistant Coach for Defensive Backs (2007), De-
fensive Coordinator for Inside Linebackers 
(2008 through 2013 and 2015), and Defensive 
Coordinator for Inside Linebackers (2014) at 
the University of Alabama, before coming back 
to UGA to serve as the Football Head Coach 
(2016). Since returning to UGA, Kirby and the 
Bulldogs have amassed championship titles at 
several levels including four in the SEC East-
ern Division, one in the SEC, and one at the 
national level. 
Coach 
Smart

ments and accomplishments as a coach in-

DENOUNCING RUSSIA-UKRAINE 
WAR MONGERING 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to address the drumbeat for war in Eastern 
Europe we have been listening to for weeks 
now. 
For over two weeks the American people 
have watched with intense concern and un-
easiness the heightened tensions between 
Ukraine and Russia. 
It is not so much the border issues between 
these nations that concerns Americans, but 
the loose talk of the Biden Administration to 
involve the United States in a hot war against 
Russia. 
Americans do not dread that territorial dis-
putes are taking place over 6,000 miles away. 
They dread that the Biden administration may 
involve them in another costly, stupid war, one 
with potentially devastating results for their 
families. 
The foreign policy issues of Eastern Europe 
are complex, but the law is not. The Constitu-
tion of the United States, written plain as day 
in Article I, Section 8, Clause 11, gives Con-
gress the so le power to declare war. 
No one else. 
Not the president, not the lifelong bureau-
crats in the State Department, or the diversity- 
trained generals in the Pentagon, and espe-
cially not the quote-unquote ‘‘experts’’ edu-
cated beyond their capacity. 
Only the people’s elected representatives. 
I have served in this body for over a dec-
ade, and it’s clear to me that Congress has no 
interest in picking up its constitutional preroga-
tive or making itself accountable to the voters. 
In their absence, I believe the need for ac-
tion must devolve to the states. Federalism re-
quires as much. 
In Arizona, State Senator Wendy Rogers 
has introduced a bill called the Defend the 
Guard Act. It stipulates that unless Congress 
has formally declared war, Arizona National 
Guardsmen are prohibited from being de-
ployed into active combat overseas. 
Rogers is a retired Lieutenant Colonel who 
served for twenty years in the U.S. Air Force. 
And I think she speaks for a lot of soldiers 
who are tired of being sent into undeclared, 
no-win wars that go on for decades. 
One of America’s finest soldiers, two-time 
Medal of Honor recipient and Marine Corps 
Major General Smedley Butler, said of our 
troops, ‘‘We Americans who will protect our 
flag should have a voice in where it is flown.’’ 
I agree. 
The United States of America has the great-
est, bravest fighting force in the history of the 
world. 
And if Congress has one ounce of respect 
for their courage and sacrifice, and the found-
ing document they swore an oath to defend 
with their lives, we would vote before ever 
sending them into battle. 
Our names should be on the dotted line be-
fore their boots ever hit the ground, whether in 
Ukraine or anywhere else in the world. 
And until Congress declares war as required 
by the Constitution, not a single Guardsmen 
from Arizona or any other state should be de-
ployed into combat. 
I believe Arizona ought to be the first state 
to pass the Defend the Guard Act and lead 
the way in protecting our sons and daughters 
in uniform from federal abuse and challenge 
this Congress to start following every part of 
the U.S. Constitution. 
If history has taught us anything it is this: 
we have lost trillions of dollars and tens of 
thousands of American lives fighting ridiculous 
wars in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. We 
have the best military force in the world and 
some of the most inept military leaders. And to 
be fair, the political rules imposed on our mili-
tary leaders, the so called Rules of Engage-
ment, deprive our military of a clear path to 
victory. Indeed, the political aspects of those 
wars, to ‘‘build nations’’ or to win hearts, is as 
inane as it was unsuccessful. War is to de-
stroy the enemy, not build nations. 
Historical failures of Western countries con-
fronting Russia militarily in Eastern Europe in 
the winter taught us the foolhardiness of such 
an effort. We cannot make the same mistake, 
in a conflict which we have no justification to 
be in to begin with. 
Most critically, the United States has no in-
terest to protect there. Certainly no interest 
strong enough to risk war with Russia. 
I denounce the war mongering.

CHIEF WILLIAM PRIOLE 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I had the honor of presenting a flag to 
Chief of Police William Priole at his retirement 
event. Chief Priole’s law enforcement career 
began with his attendance at the 52nd session 
of Atlantic County Police Academy. He served 
as a patrol officer until his promotion to Cor-
poral in 2006. In 2007, Chief Priole earned the 
coveted David C. Douglass Officer of the Year 
award for his outstanding performance in the 
Patrol Division. He was then promoted to Ser-
geant in 2011, Lieutenant in 2015, Captain in 
2019, and Chief of Police in 2021. For over 30 
years, he has protected and served the citi-
zens of Lower Township. Chief Priole should 
be proud of his accomplishments and it was 
my honor to have had the opportunity to rec-
ognize him for his service to the South Jersey 
community. God Bless Chief Priole and God 
Bless America.

KENT HOPKINS 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of a grateful Nation and the citizens of the 
Texas–24, the 2021 Congressional Veteran 
Commendation is hereby presented to Kent 
Hopkins, Petty Officer 3rd Class, United 
States Navy, of Euless, Texas, for his honor-
able service in the Armed Forces of the United 
States of America and for his continued dedi-
cation to his community. 
Mr. Hopkins enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 
1960, having served until 1964 as an air-
crewman with VF–9, serving on the P–3 Orion 
maritime surveillance aircraft. Notable assign-
ments include serving as a part of Joint Task 
Force 8 during Operation Dominic nuclear 
testing in the Johnston Atoll in 1962. Other as-
signments include maritime surveillance of So-
viet military assets in the Far East during the 
height of the Cold War. 
After leaving the Navy, Mr. Hopkins has 
brought the same love he had for his country 
and poured it into making his community a 
better place. He has served on several 
boards, commissions, and committees. Among 
these are as a member of Lions Club, Opti-
mists Club, a volunteer for the Boy Scouts of 
America, a former governor of the DFW Col-
ony of the Society of Mayflower Descendants, 
Mr. Hopkins has also served as a precinct 
chairman and election judge, as well as a vol-
unteer for several local-area churches. 
Mr. Hopkins’ career is marked with heroism 
and is consistent with the finest traditions of 
the United States Navy and reflects great 
credit upon himself, the State of Texas, and 
the United States of America.

CONGRESS 
MUST 
IMMEDIATELY 
REVERSE AMORTIZATION OF RE-
SEARCH 
AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
(‘‘R&D’’) EXPENSES 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to address an urgent tax policy 
matter. 
At the start of this year, a key bipartisan tax 
policy ended. It had been around for nearly 70 
years. For nearly 7 decades American tax-
payers had been able to immediately deduct 
R&D expenses. 
What has changed since the beginning of 
2022, Madam Speaker? Taxpayers are now 
required to deduct R&D expenses over a pe-
riod of years. This spread-out deduction is 
what is known as amortization. 
What does it mean, Madam Speaker? Ex-
penses would be recovered more slowly. To 
those innovative businesses cash flow will be 
reduced. Reduced cash flow means less dol-
lars for R&D. Smaller R&D budgets will harm

R&D activity in the United States. That’s the 
effect of increasing the tax burden borne by 
those innovating businesses. 
Will there be a loss of jobs, Madam Speak-
er? The answer is yes. One study concludes 
the job losses would total over 20,000 jobs in 
the first five years. As bad as that is, the same 
study concludes job losses would be three 
times as much in the second five years. We’re 
talking about 60,000 jobs lost. 
How will this change affect U.S. global com-
petitiveness, Madam Speaker? The answer is 
it will hurt U.S. competitiveness abroad. If al-
lowed to remain in effect, the U.S. policy of 
amortization would treat innovation-related ex-
penses worse than any other developed coun-
try. Prior to amortization going into effect, the 
U.S. was already ranked 27th of 37 OECD 
countries with respect to R&D incentives. If 
amortization remains, things get worse. In ef-
fect, the U.S. will fall further behind our com-
petitors when it comes to incentivizing R&D. 
If Congress fails to delay amortization be-
fore March 31st, the first quarter of 2022, busi-
nesses will be forced to act. Estimated cash 
tax payments will increase by more than $8 
billion in just the first quarter alone. The effect 
will be an immediate reduction in capital that 
can support R&D. Of prime concern to Con-
gress should be the loss of more than 20,000 
direct R&D jobs this year without our action. 
A four-year delay of amortization is included 
in the House-passed Build Back Better legisla-
tion and the initial Senate substitute. I would 
have hoped we would already have addressed 
this issue, but while progress on that legisla-
tion awaits final disposition in the Senate, 
Congress must begin to consider whatever is 
the fastest path to enactment because time is 
of the essence. 
One option would be the two pieces of leg-
islation designed to address China competi-
tion. The House is considering the America 
Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre- 
Eminence in Technology and Economic Sta-
bility (‘‘America COMPETES’’) Act of 2022. 
Our Senate colleagues have passed their own 
version 
of 
China 
competition 
legislation. 
Speaker PELOSI has said she plans to reach a 
bipartisan agreement to bring these two bills 
together. 
Madam Speaker, what does restoring de-
ductibility of R&D have to do with the China 
competition bills? The short answer is plenty. 
In terms of competitiveness, China and Amer-
ica are moving in different directions on tax in-
centives for R&D. The Chinese have enacted 
a super deduction for R&D expenses. For 
manufacturing companies in China, that de-
duction yields an extra 100 percent of eligible 
R&D expenses. This deduction is in addition 
to actual R&D expenses incurred. That’s why 
they call it a super deduction. 
Let’s discuss an example. A manufacturing 
company that undertakes $100 of R&D in 
China would deduct $200. By contrast, a com-
pany that undertakes $100 of R&D in the 
United States would deduct only $10 in 2022. 
R&D conducted in China would thus receive 
20 times the tax benefit of R&D conducted in 
the U.S. When all R&D incentives are consid-
ered, China would have incentives more than 
11 times as generous as those of the United 
States. Eleven times as generous, Madam 
Speaker. How are American companies going 
to win the race with Chinese companies who 
have that kind of head start? 
We should look at including the four-year 
delay of amortization of R&D in the final Amer-
ica COMPETES legislation. Inclusion becomes 
more important if it appears lo be moving 
more quickly than the Build Back Better legis-
lation. 
Madam Speaker, there is another legislative 
vehicle Congress should consider for this ur-
gent matter. Congress is in the process of ad-
dressing defense and non-defense appropria-
tions spending because the continuing resolu-
tion expires on February 18, 2022. Congres-
sional negotiators should be aware that a re-
versal of the decades-old R&D tax incentives 
brings 
adverse 
national 
security 
con-
sequences. 
Where’s the linkage to national security? 
Look no further than the National Science and 
Technology Council. They concluded that ‘‘en-
suring national security and resilience is crit-
ical for the United States, especially as other 
nations dramatically increase their R&D ex-
penditures’’ and sustained R&D investments 
‘‘are essential to ensure that the United States 
remains able to secure and protect the Amer-
ican people in the face of this increased com-
petition.’’ Ignoring R&D amortization would 
have implications for our national security in-
terests and should be resolved by the time 
these issues are settled. 
Madam Speaker, strong tax incentives for 
R&D have long had bipartisan support. The 
initial R&D credit was passed by a Democratic 
House. Republican Senate, and signed by 
President Reagan. Last year a bipartisan 
group of 96 House members and 26 Senators 
introduced legislation permanently reversing 
amortization of R&D expenditures. With amor-
tization of R&D now in effect, the bipartisan 
goal of restoring this bipartisan tax incentive 
becomes even more compelling. 
Congress must act immediately, certainly 
before the end of this quarter, to maintain the 
immediate deductibility of R&D expenditures. 
As each month passes, failure to act yields 
proportionately more harm to US innovation 
and competitiveness. All available legislative 
vehicles should be considered. 
Madam Speaker, America’s innovators can-
not wait further.

ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC SAFETY 
CONCERNS OF ST. PAUL 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
call attention to correspondence I recently re-
ceived from Todd Axtell, Chief of the St. Paul 
Police Department. Chief Axtell and the men 
and women in uniform of the department who 
serve my constituents are extraordinary public 
servants who operate with a level of profes-
sionalism that has been consistently dem-
onstrated during the difficult circumstances of 
the past two years. Therefore, I include in the 
RECORD Chief Axtell’s letter to highlight the in-
creasing challenges being placed on St. Paul 
police officers. 
At this moment, the City of St. Paul is the 
venue for the federal trial of three former Min-
neapolis police officers involved in the murder 
of Mr. George Floyd in May 2020. This trial 
has been brought by federal authorities, re-
garding federal civil rights charges, and con-
cerns a crime that occurred in Minneapolis, 
not in St. Paul. By selecting St. Paul as the 
venue for this federal trial, extraordinary secu-
rity and financial burdens are being placed 
upon the City of St. Paul, Ramsey County, 
and our local taxpayers. 
It is my belief that the federal court and De-
partment of Justice must not be allowed to 
shift security related costs onto local govern-
ment and taxpayers. This is simply unaccept-
able. Therefore, I am exploring funding options 
that will ensure the federal government covers 
all costs associated with security for this fed-
eral trial and the City of St. Paul, the St. Paul 
Police Department, and the property taxpayers 
of St. Paul are held financially harmless. 
Though I cannot guarantee funding, my office 
will make every effort to achieve this goal. 
Madam Speaker, I remain committed to 
working with both local and federal counter-
parts to achieve a positive outcome for the 
people of St. Paul. I would also like to recog-
nize Chief Axtell for his leadership and the 
day-to-day commitment of the St. Paul Police 
Department to meet the needs of our constitu-
ents. 
DEPARTMENT OF POLICE, 
CITY OF SAINT PAUL, 
January 21, 2022. 
Hon. BETTY MCCOLLUM, 
House of Representatives, Saint Paul, MN. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE
MCCOLLUM: The 
murder of Mr. George Floyd while in the cus-
tody of Minneapolis police officers on May 
25, 2020 sparked unprecedented civil unrest in 
the State of Minnesota and across the globe. 
For several days, an outpouring of frustra-
tion sparked reactions ranging from massive 
demonstrations, to looting, to widespread de-
struction of property. In the Twin Cities, two 
people were killed and our community suf-
fered millions of dollars in property damage, 
including 330 buildings in Saint Paul that 
were damaged or destroyed. 
The past two years have brought dramatic 
changes in law enforcement staffing; police 
officers are leaving the profession in num-
bers that haven’t been seen before. The Saint 
Paul Police Department is currently down 80 
sworn officers, our lowest staffing level since 
the 1990’s. Additionally, the ongoing COVID– 
19 pandemic offers daily staffing challenges 
as members of our department contract the 
highly contagious virus and are required to 
quarantine. 
While short-staffed, Saint Paul officers are 
being pushed to the brink while continuing 
to deliver the high level of service expected 
by our community. In 2021, Saint Paul expe-
rienced a record high number of homicides 
and saw dramatic increases in other violent 
crimes. 
While struggling to meet the day-to-day 
challenges of maintaining public safety, our 
department was notified at the end of No-
vember 2021 that the federal civil rights trial 
for the four former Minneapolis police offi-
cers involved in George Floyd’s murder 
would be held in downtown Saint Paul at the 
federal courthouse—even though the tragic 
incident occurred in a different jurisdiction. 
As the murder of Mr. Floyd took place in 
the City of Minneapolis while in custody of 
Minneapolis police officers, no one antici-
pated the federal trial being held in Saint 
Paul. 
Law enforcement organizations are typi-
cally given six to twelve months to plan for 
a trial of this magnitude. However, we were 
given fewer than two months to plan and 
prepare with our federal and local partners 
for the upcoming federal trial. 
Tensions in the community remain high. 
Protests and calls for systemic changes con-
tinue. The upcoming federal trial has been 
highly publicized and may inflame intense 
emotions for individuals across the country.

While we have worked diligently to pre-
pare, it will come at a steep price to our 
community, our financial bottom line and 
our officers’ wellbeing. 
Preliminary budget numbers show this 
trial could cost the City of Saint Paul $2 mil-
lion and up to an additional $2 million in 
mutual aid costs for our East Metro part-
ners. These estimates cover items such as 
training, equipment, protecting critical in-
frastructure and fencing, personnel costs, 
and other needs that arise as a result of the 
trial being held in our city. 
With staffing levels critically low, per-
sonnel working during an ongoing pandemic, 
and officers working a great deal of overtime 
just to maintain minimum staffing levels, 
having this federal trial in our city is an ex-
tremely heavy lift for our department. 
I respectfully seek assistance from the 
FY22 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) 
funding bill to reimburse the City of Saint 
Paul. It is our hope that this will ease the fi-
nancial strain that the upcoming federal 
trial will place on our department. 
The Saint Paul Police Department’s point 
of contact for additional information is Dep-
uty Chief Stacy Murphy. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
TODD AXTELL, 
Chief of Police.

earned a scholarship to play on the lacrosse 
team. Eric should be proud of his accomplish-
ments and it was an honor to have had the 
opportunity to recognize him and I wish him 
the best of luck in his future endeavors. God 
Bless Eric and God Bless America.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
CORPORAL YSABEL ‘‘MAC’’ ORTIZ 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Corporal Ysabel 
‘‘Mac’’ Ortiz, who proudly served his country in 
the Korean War and was missing in action for 
70 years. 
Corporal Ortiz was born in 1931 and raised 
in El Monte, California. As a third generation 
El Montean, he attended El Monte High 
School before enlisting in the U.S. Army at the 
age of 17. In 1950, Corporal Ortiz was de-
ployed to fight in the Korean War and was as-
signed to a M–19 anti-aircraft tank. His tank 
took a direct hit on December 2, 1950, and his 
remains were not found for 70 years. In Janu-
ary of 1954, Corporal Ortiz was posthumously 
awarded the Purple Heart for making the ulti-
mate sacrifice for his country. 
Although he was listed as missing in action, 
his family never gave up hope that he would 
someday return home and receive the hero’s 
burial he so much deserved. In 2019, 55 cas-
kets containing the remains of American sol-
diers were returned to the United States after 
a summit with North Korea, and DNA evi-
dence provided by Corporal Ortiz’s siblings 
was instrumental in identifying his remains. 
Over 70 years later, he finally made it home. 
Corporal Ortiz is survived by his mother 
Concha Ortiz (now deceased), his father 
Ysabel M. Ortiz, Sr. (now deceased), his 
brothers Harold Ortiz (now deceased) and 
Jose Lucio Ortiz (now deceased), his sisters 
Esmeralda ‘‘Chata’’ Ortiz Ureno (now de-
ceased) and Jennie Sanchez (now deceased), 
his step-brothers Rudy Ortiz (now deceased), 
Manuel Ortiz of El Monte, and Joe Ortiz of Ba-
kersfield, and step-sisters Rose Soto of West 
Covina and Ana Sanchez of Murrieta, 
Over the next 70 years, both Corporal Or-
tiz’s family and community would work to rec-
ognize his sacrifice and to ensure that his 
memory lived on. Corporal Ortiz is recognized 
on a bronze plaque honoring our nation’s war 
dead at the El Monte Historical Museum, and 
his photo also hangs at the La Historia Mu-
seum/Museo de Los Barrios veterans’ exhibit 
in El Monte. In 2022, a new 53-unit veterans 
housing project developed by the Cesar Cha-
vez Foundation is scheduled to be opened in 
El Monte and will be named Plaza Ortiz in 
honor of Corporal Ortiz. The housing project 
will include a monument with a mural and a 
plaque to commemorate Corporal Ortiz’s serv-
ice to our nation. 
I extend my deepest sympathies to the fam-
ily and friends of fallen Corporal Ysabel ‘‘Mac’’ 
Ortiz, and I would like to recognize the dedica-
tion and years of work shown by his family to 
finally have Corporal Ortiz laid to rest with full 
honors at Riverside National Cemetery in Cali-
fornia. I urge all my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing Corporal Ortiz’s ultimate sacrifice 
for our Nation.

From 1943 to 1946, Mr. Malone honorably 
guarded depots and Prisoners of War (POW) 
during World War II, where his battalion was 
sent to Normandy one week after D-Day. On 
July 2, 2019, he was presented with a Quilt of 
Valor, a handmade quilt awarded to a service 
member or veteran who fought for our nation. 
After returning from war, he married his high 
school sweetheart, Ethelda Mason, on June 
5th, 1946, and together they raised five chil-
dren. Mr. Malone worked at the Decatur 
Southern Railway Depot. He and Ethelda were 
married for 64 years before the Lord called 
her home in May of 2011. 
After working for the Decatur Southern Rail-
way Depot for 35-years, Mr. Malone was given 
the distinguished honor of having the ticket of-
fice at the train depot named after him in 
2016. He is currently the oldest living em-
ployee of the Depot today. 
Since 1975, Mr. Malone has been a devoted 
member of Alpha Seventh Day Adventist 
Church where he remains active today. In 
2012, he was featured on the cover of Radar, 
a premier business and entertainment maga-
zine, spotlighting Mr. Malone as making a dif-
ference in his community and his country. Also 
in 2012, the Decatur Minority Development 
Association partnered with local businesses 
and corporations to host the first annual Ross 
Malone Charity Golf Tournament in his honor. 
Madam Speaker, Ross Malone, Jr.’s military 
service, work ethic, and passion for serving

Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of a grateful Nation and the citizens of the 
Texas–24, the 2021 Congressional Veteran 
Commendation is hereby presented to Michael 
Esquivel, Lieutenant Colonel, United States 
Army, of Grapevine, for his honorable service 
in the Armed Forces of the United States of 
America and for his continued dedication to 
his community. 
Mr. Esquivel was commissioned as an offi-
cer upon graduation from the United States 
Military Academy at West Point in 1988 and 
served as an infantry officer during Operation 
Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War. He 
later became a civil affairs officer, seeing com-

Mountain Division in Afghanistan. His decora-
tions include the Bronze Medal, the Meri-
torious Service Medal, the Army Commenda-
tion Medal, and the Combat Infantryman 
Badge. 
After retiring from the Army, Mr. Esquivel 
brought the same love he had for his country 
and poured it into making his community a 
better place. He has served as an instructor at 
Tarrant County Community College, helping 
launch its Logistics and Supply Chain Man-
agement Program, a founder of the Northwest 
Campus Community Market which helps dis-
tribute food across the community, a member 
of Team Rubicon, and volunteers with his wife 
with dog rescue groups such as the Society 
for Companion Animals and the DFW Pet 
Loss Support Group. 
Mr. Esquivel’s career is marked with her-
oism and is consistent with the finest traditions 
of the United States Army and reflects great 
credit upon himself, the State of Texas, and 
the United States of America.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
150TH 
ANNI-

OF 
JEWISH 
FAMILY 
SERVICES 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize Jewish Family Services 
(JFS) and join them in celebrating their 150th 
Anniversary. JFS is a nonprofit human serv-
ices organization that draws upon traditional 
Jewish values to provide services to those in 
need—regardless of their faith, age, income, 
ability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. 
Founded in 1872, JFS began as the Hebrew 
Benevolent Society to meet the needs of Den-
ver’s first 300 Jewish pioneers. From there, 
JFS has continued to grow and expand their 
mission—meeting the moment time and time 
again. They helped resettle Holocaust sur-
vivors in the wake of World War II, opened a 
group home for individuals with disabilities in 
the 1980s, formed an Employment Services 
Department in 2021, and continue to fight day 
after day to remove barriers to employment 
and help people find opportunities to work to-
wards a livable wage. 
In the face of an unprecedented pandemic 
and seemingly insurmountable difficulties, JFS 
continued to provide food security, children’s 
services, mental health counseling, disability 
services, employment support, and housing 
stability. In the last year alone, JFS helped 
over 25,000 individuals with the aid of over 
1,300 volunteers to stand strong against 
COVID–19 and address the needs of the com-
munity regardless of circumstance. 
At the beginning of 2022, JFS became a 
temporary 
Afghan 
Refugee 
Resettlement 
Agency—providing comprehensive services to 
refugees arriving from Afghanistan who are 
starting new lives in in the Denver metro area. 
These services include cultural orientation, 
housing, employment, food, school enrollment, 
and referrals to language classes. 
For 150 years our community has been 
made a better, more inclusive place to live be-
cause of the thousands of selfless JFS volun-
teers who have pulled upon their faith to serve 
our community and improve the lives of oth-
ers. I congratulate and thank JFS for their 
service to our community and look forward to 
the incredible achievements the next 150 
years will bring.

Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the pleasure of presenting 
Bryanna Storck with her Eagle Scout Court of 
Honor. Bryanna made history in South Jersey, 
becoming the first female to earn the honor of 
Eagle Scout. When she was a 16-year-old girl 
scout, Bryanna went on a backpacking trip 
with her father. This is when she decided she 
wanted a more challenging program and de-
cided to join Boy Scouts of America. In just 27 
months, Bryanna earned 22 merit badges and 
completed the 325 requirements needed to 
earn the Eagle Scout honor. For her Eagle 
Scout project, she built a fire pit for events at 
Greentree Church in Egg Harbor Township, 
South Jersey. As the first woman in the region 
to earn this honor, Bryanna should be very 
proud of her accomplishments, and it was an 
honor to have had the opportunity to meet her 
and present her with this prestigious honor. 
God Bless Bryanna and God Bless America.

BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. FRANK D. LUCAS 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 2022 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to H.R. 4521, the so-called 
‘‘America COMPETES Act of 2022.’’ And I re-
gret the path the Democratic leadership has 
taken with bringing this bill to the floor. 
Some will call this a ‘‘competitiveness pack-
age’’ or a ‘‘supply chain’’ bill. Others claim the 
bill is about countering the Chinese Com-
munist Party. But the truth is that it is none of 
those things. If this 3,000-page bill seems to 
have no coherence or strategic purpose, that’s 
because it doesn’t. This package was tossed 
together by Democratic leadership with no Re-
publican input, and from what I understand 
with very little coordination between the Com-
mittee chairs. The Speaker hijacked good bi-
partisan bills dealing with U.S. competitive-
ness and countering the malign influence of 
China to pass another Democratic wish list 
that will go nowhere in the Senate. 
By combining competitiveness bills with par-
tisan poison pills, H.R. 4521 undoes more 
than a year of bipartisan work by the House 
Science Committee to develop and pass com-
prehensive legislation to double investment in 
basic research. As Ranking Member of the 
Science Committee, I was proud to work with 
Chairwoman JOHNSON to produce good policy 
that will double our investment in basic 
science, support the most important emerging 
technologies, build our technical workforce, 
and protect our research from theft. The 
House Science Committee passed more than 
a dozen bills to scale-up America’s research 
and development capabilities over the next 
decade, ensuring the Chinese Communist 
Party does not achieve its goal of overtaking 
the U.S. in science and technology, giving 
them a dangerous economic and national se-
curity advantage. 
At the center of our work is the National 
Science for the Future Act and the Depart-
ment of Energy Science for the Future Act, 
which both passed the House with over-
whelming bipartisan support in June. When we 
passed those bills, I had high hopes that for 
once, Congress might be able to work to-
gether to get something done. The economic 
and national security threats from China grow 
every day, and the Chinese Communist Party 
has been clear that their target is to surpass 
the United States. 
The Senate has passed their own bipartisan 
package, the U.S. innovation and Competition 
Act (USICA) in June. While there are many 
flaws in USICA, I believe that we had a good 
opportunity to find a consensus agreement 
through a formal House and Senate Con-
ference. 
I have been urging Democratic leadership to 
begin conferencing these bills with the Senate 
since the summer, to no avail. And now that 
House Democratic leadership has finally de-
cided to act, and they have done so with no 
regard for all this bipartisan work. 
Instead of focusing on strong consensus 
policies, this package is filled with poison pills 
with no bipartisan support. There was no need 
to make this partisan. 
I believe that if given the opportunity we 
could have passed legislation that invests in 
American research, strengthens our supply 
chains, spurs private sector investment, en-
sures the domestic production of semicon-
ductor chips, and confronts China’s malign be-
havior. This bill is nothing more than a distrac-
tion. Now I fear that this week’s exercise will 
make it more difficult to reach a bicameral, bi-
partisan deal on a bill. 
We cannot afford to play politics while the 
Chinese Communist Party threatens our eco-
nomic and national security. I urge my col-
leagues to come back to the table to negotiate 
strategic, bipartisan legislation that addresses 
this generational threat. I ask my colleagues to 
oppose this flawed, partisan package.

BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 2022 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
address H.R. 4521, the America COMPETES 
Act of 2022, which the House is considering. 
I have worked closely with several committees 
on key parts of this legislation—including the 
creation of a new class of start-up visas to at-
tract the next generation of Immigrant entre-
preneurs and the reauthorization of the Na-
tional Science Foundation to supercharge our 
country’s investments in cutting-edge re-
search. However, I have concerns with an-
other part of this bill—the inclusion of the 
‘‘SHOP SAFE Act’’ in Section 80301. 
The laudable intent behind the SHOP SAFE 
Act is to help combat the on line sale of coun-
terfeit goods, which I certainly share. How-
ever, the SHOP SAFE Act as presently con-
structed has three flaws. 
First, SHOP SAFE could raise the adminis-
trative burdens and transaction costs of many 
small businesses and small sellers. This could 
be especially disruptive for the sale of used 
goods and other secondary markets, and for 
artisanal and other non-mass market products 
that do not fit neatly into the big-brand tem-
plates that this bill would likely impose. As a 
result, consumers could also suffer as costs 
go up and sellers could go down in many of 
these markets. 
Second, only the largest online market-
places with the deepest pockets may be able 
to bear the full technological and economic 
burdens that SHOP SAFE would impose. As a 
result, the bill risks entrenching their domi-
nance at the expense of nascent and future 
competitors. 
Third, SHOP SAFE takes a ‘‘kitchen-sink’’ 
approach to combat counterfeit listings, impos-
ing over a dozen sweeping requirements that 
platforms must implement to avoid crippling li-
ability for third-party infringement. Yet no one 
has been able to explain which of these steps, 
if any, will really make a difference over the 
status quo in stemming the flow of counter-
feits. Indeed, some online marketplaces al-
ready police their listings in many different 
ways, without the legal pressure imposed by 
this bill. 
These concerns came up during the Judici-
ary Committee’s markup of the SHOP SAFE 
Act last fall. Members, including several who 
voted to advance the bill, called for further 
work on the bill. Based on public discussion at 
the markup, it was expected a committee-driv-
en process to make changes to the SHOP 
SAFE Act would happen before it moved for-
ward. Regrettably, given that the ordinary leg-
islative process towards the floor did not 
occur, we now find SHOP SAFE has been in-
serted without improvements into this much 
larger legislation. 
There is another approach included in the 
America COMPETES Act, in Section 20213, 
the INFORM Consumers Act. This legislation 
would boost enforcement efforts through regu-
lation by requiring on line marketplaces to 
verify the identity of high-volume sellers, while 
requiring the disclosure of basic information 
about seller identity to consumers. Some of 
these requirements overlap with those im-
posed in the SHOP SAFE Act. 
As such, the America COMPETES Act con-
tains two visions of how to make sure on line 
marketplaces are safe. It is my hope that a 
targeted approach, like the INFORM Con-
sumers Act, will help bring forth a sensible 
resolution to this issue as the America COM-
PETES Act moves to a conference committee.

Mr. Stacy was commissioned as an officer 
in the U.S. Army in 1966 and spent over 20 
years as an infantry officer before retiring in 
1989. During his time in service, he was de-
ployed to Vietnam, where in 1967 his platoon 
was ambushed by the Viet Cong. Stacy suc-
cessfully led his men in a charge on the en-
emy’s well-fortified position, and in another 
firefight took point position to maneuver his 
platoon to safety out of the kill zone. In 1969, 
Stacy managed to move several of his wound-
ed troops from the assault area while under 
attack from the Vietnamese despite being 
wounded himself. Stacy’s actions during the 
war earned him the Silver Star with an Oak 
Leaf Cluster denoting a second award, the 
Purple Heart with an Oak Leaf Cluster denot-
ing a second award, the Bronze Star with V 
device denoting valorous actions, the Meri-
torious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clus-
ter denoting subsequent awards, the Army 
Achievement Medal, the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, 
and the Republic of Vietnam Service Medal. 
After retiring from the Army, Mr. Stacy has

the Colleyville Rotary Club, the Board of Di-
rectors of the Fort Worth Air Power Council, 
and a permanent member of the 82nd Air-

fire departments. He began as a Firefighter I 
in Dearborn on April 28th, 1998. He rose to 
level of Firefighter II in December 2003. In 
2006, he was promoted to Fire Engineer and 
after excelling in that role he was promoted to 
Fire Apparatus Supervisor Assistant in 2010 
and then Lieutenant in 2012. On December 
16, 2013, he became Deputy Fire Chief. 
Deputy Fire Chief Thorington is the recipient 
of numerous awards and commendations for 
spectacular service to his community, includ-
ing the John D. Dingell Medal of Freedom Me-
morial Commendation, the Fire Chief Life Sav-
ing Award, the Gino Polidori Community Serv-
ice Award, the Outstanding Officer Award, the 
Vaccination Center Award, and the Meritorious

Dearborn Firefighters Association IAFF Local 
412 from 2011 to 2013. Hard working and one 
of the biggest University of Michigan fans, 
Deputy Fire Chief Thorington has left his mark 
on the Dearborn Fire Department by setting

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
service of a remarkable individual, Ethel B. 
Toy Gordon. 
Ethel was born February 11, 1925, in 
Holmes County to Daniel and Leola Brown 
Toy. Ethel, at the age of 96, was called to her 
heavenly resting place on Wednesday, Janu-
ary 28, 2022, in her home of Greenwood, MS. 
At an early age she professed her faith in 
Jesus Christ. Ethel joined Meeks AME Church 
in Cruger, MS. 
Ethel was influenced by her family to be a 
loving and caring woman. She always gave 
her time to others. Ethel married James Gor-
don in 1944, to that union 13 children were 
born. She later joined Gordon Chapel MB 
Church until moving to Greenwood, MS. 
In 2018, Ethel joined Providence MB Church 
until she passed away. She believed in family, 
and she always shared her childhood stories. 
It was never a dull moment and always great 
laughs and good meals. Ethel wanted every-
one to love each other because love was one 
of the many morals that were instilled in her. 
Ethel was a God-fearing woman. One of her 
favorite sayings was ‘‘If it had not been for the 
Lord on my side, I wouldn’t be nothing nor 
would I have nothing.’’ She was a blessed 
woman of God, who was full of life and joy. 
After the sudden passing of her husband, she 
was left with ten children to raise. By the 
Grace of God, they never needed nor wanted 
for anything. She was a woman to be admired 
and praised. Ethel B. received everything she 
deserved until her departure. 
Ethel B. Toy Gordon was proceeded in 
death by her loving parents: Daniel and Leola 
Toy, her husband James Gordon, brothers 
Louis Toy, Jonas Toy, three sisters Dorothy 
Toy, Mattie Toy Martin, Viola Toy Mont-
gomery, two sons Arthur Gordon and Eddie 
Gordon, two daughters Charlene Cooper and 
Trufilia Hayes, one grandson Billy Gordon. Her 
beautiful life will forever be cherished in the 
lives of her family and friends. On today she 
leaves loving memories to the 13 children, 8 
daughters, 5 sons, 1 God son, 32 grand-
children, 50 great grand-children, 8 great great 
grandchildren, two sisters, and one brother. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life, legacy, and service of 
Mrs. Ethel B. Toy Gordon.

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Protecting Federal Agen-
cies and Employees from Political Interference 
Act, which would require an act of Congress 
before the headquarters for any federal entity 
located in the National Capital Region (NCR) 
on today’s date may be moved out of the 
NCR. This bill is cosponsored by Representa-
tives ANTHONY BROWN, GWEN MOORE, JAMIE 
RASKIN and DAVID TRONE. 
The Trump administration moved the head-
quarters of agencies out of the NCR to the 
detriment of employees, their families and the 
work of these agencies. Employees who work 
in agency headquarters fulfill the indispen-
sable role of keeping Congress and the presi-
dent informed of agency activities. Congress 
cannot do its work to write laws and engage 
in vital oversight without the unvarnished facts 
that federal agencies provide. Two years after

the Department of Agriculture (USDA) relo-
cated the Economic Research Service and the 
National Institute of Food and Agriculture to 
Kansas City, they are operating with roughly 
30% fewer employees, with former USDA Di-
rector of Communications Matt Herrick admit-
ting that these agencies had ‘‘lost some of the 
nation’s best economists and agricultural sci-
entists.’’ 
Furthermore, nearly 300 employees retired 
or quit after the Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM) moved its headquarters to Grand Junc-
tion, Colorado. The Biden administration’s re-
turn of BLM headquarters to our nation’s cap-
ital is greatly appreciated and will go a long 
way to restore the valuable expertise that has 
been lost. 
While I do not expect the Biden administra-
tion to move agencies out of the NCR, this bill 
would protect against irrational decisions of fu-
ture presidents. Unless measures like this bill 
are taken to stop agencies from relocating, the 
federal government will lose more employees 
and agencies will be unable to perform critical 
tasks, including assisting Congress in vital 
oversight. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Ms. Karen Brents on 
the occasion of her retirement from the Los 
Angeles Police Department. After thirty years 
of dedicated civic service to the people and 
communities of Los Angeles, Ms. Brents will 
be sorely missed. 
Ms. Karen Brents’ extensive career with the 
Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) began 
in 1989. Her excellence in the field and out-
standing performance in emergency situations 
led to her receiving over thirty commendations 
within the Department and a promotion to Po-
lice Service Representative III (PSR Ill) in 
1996. During her tenure, she was recognized 
by the District Attorney’s office for her exem-
plary courtroom behavior and communication 
skills. 
Ms. Karen Brents was also deeply involved 
with training the next generation of 9–1–1 dis-
patchers and was a productive and reliable 
asset to the training cadre. Because of her 
deep engagement and dedication to the train-
ing program, Ms. Brents received multiple ac-
colades and certificates for her hard work. 
Ms. Karen Brents likewise received a dozen 
certificates and recognitions for her service 
and contribution to her community, including 
the 2006 certificate of achievement to the 
Community Relations Unit, the 2000 National 
Dispatchers Week, and a 2006 certificate of 
achievement from the California Public Safety 
Radio Association (CAPRA). 
For her remarkable accomplishments, it is 
my honor to recognize Police Service Rep-
resentative III Karen Brents. Her decades of 
civic service and commitment are worthy of 
the highest commendation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF REP. 
ESTEBAN TORRES 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 3, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Congressman Esteban 
Torres. 
Congressman Torres was a Los Angeles 
icon, a beloved public servant who proudly 
represented East Angelinos here in the Peo-
ple’s House for nearly two decades. He was a 
trailblazer who paved the path for someone 
like me—the son of working class, Mexican 
immigrants—to stand here in this chamber 
today. 
A Decorated Korean War veteran and labor 
organizer, he never stopped fighting to lift up 
the working class and advance immigrant 
rights. He stood for all that is good and just, 
and his legacy should be a model for all those 
who serve in this body.
