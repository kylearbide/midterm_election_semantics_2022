PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, if we but look we would 
see that Your faithfulness extends to 
all generations. You, who established 
the Earth and everything that dwells 
therein, 
have 
shown 
Your 
mercy 
throughout the ages. 
O Lord, You have stood firm and all 
things have been given life out of Your 
infinite love. The mind that created 
the universe provides for us even now 
through both Your revealed word and 
Your transcendent presence. 
Let us, then, be ever mindful of the 
principles You have laid before us, 
Your model for law and justice. 
May we never fail to consider the 
commands of peace and mercy. 
May we also find delight in Your fi-
delity and rejoice in Your salvation, by 
observing Your statutes, and living 
into Your desires for us. 
We offer our prayers to You, knowing 
that our attempts to serve You fall 
short; what we perceive as perfect has 
its innate limits; our energies and ef-
forts are woefully inadequate. 
But this day we lean on Your mercy 
and depend on Your everlasting love; 
for it is in the strength of Your name 
we pray. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING 
MR. 
AND 
MRS. 
BETTERTON ON THEIR 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. BROOKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. and Mrs. Betterton on their 
fiftieth wedding anniversary. 
Erby Wayne Betterton was born on Feb-
ruary 28, 1948 in Decatur, Alabama. Four 
years later, Valeri Lynn Dunaway was born on 
May 21, 1952, in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. 
While on leave from his duties in the U.S. 
Army, Wayne met Valeri through his brother. 
After Wayne finished his three-year commit-
ment to the Army, he returned home and pro-
posed to Valeri on her 18th birthday, which 
also happened to be the day she graduated 
from Butler High School. On August 01, 1971, 
Wayne and Valeri were married at West 
Huntsville Church of Christ. 
Looking back over their life together, Wayne 
and Valeri recognize the many blessings they 
have experienced together. 
For instance, Wayne served in the U.S. 
Army on the front lines of the Vietnam War 
and returned home safely. Upon returning 
home and completing his service, Wayne went 
to work as a tire builder with Dunlop Tire 
Company. Meanwhile, Valeri worked in the 
food stamp office until 1975, when she and 
Wayne welcomed their first daughter into their 
home. Later, in 1979, Valeri had another little 
girl. By this time, Valeri chose to change her 
career to become a stay-at-home mother. 
Later, Valeri returned to work as a state em-
ployee and retired after twenty-five years of 
service. Wayne retired after thirty-three and a 
half years at Dunlop, which is when the plant 
was closed. 
Today, Wayne and Valeri are enjoying re-
tirement by being heavily involved in their 
grandchildren’s lives and their local church 
and community. One of their favorite past 
times is watching the Atlanta Braves. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Wayne 
and 
Valeri 
Betterton’s marriage serves as a reminder to 
us all, that with unwavering commitment and 
perseverance, marriage is truly a wonderful 
blessing. 
I wish Mr. and Mrs. Betterton the very best 
as they enjoy their fiftieth wedding anniversary 
and celebrate with their family.

COMMUNITY FIRST FOUNDATION 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Community First Founda-
tion as the 2020 Behind the Scenes award 
winner by the Arvada Chamber of Commerce. 
For many decades, Community First Founda-
tion has done exceptional work in supporting 
Colorado nonprofits, but they showed par-
ticular leadership and commitment to our com-
munity throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Community First Foundation was originally 
founded in 1975 as the Lutheran Medical Cen-
ter Foundation. In these beginning years, they 
focused on fundraising efforts for the Lutheran 
Medical Center, a nonprofit hospital supporting 
the western suburbs of Denver. Today, they 
help donors with philanthropic planning, and 
support nonprofits with grants and resources 
in order to build resilient and connected com-
munities across Jefferson County. The organi-
zation has seen incredible success in its initia-
tives, particularly in its founding and continued 
sponsorship of the annual Colorado Gives 
Day. Created in 2010, Colorado Gives Day is 
now the second-largest 24 hour day of giving 
in the nation, with more than $419 million do-
nated to Colorado nonprofits between 2010 
and 2020. In recognition of this initiative, Com-
munity First Foundation was named the Out-
standing Foundation of the Year by Ability 
Connection Colorado in 2014. 
More recently, Community First Foundation 
served our community in exceptional ways 
through their efforts to strengthen and stabilize 
nonprofit organizations across Jefferson Coun-
ty during the COVID–19 pandemic. They es-
tablished the Jefferson County Hope Fund to 
ensure the nonprofit community and govern-
ment agencies serving Jefferson County could 
continue their services and response to the 
public health crisis. As of April 2020, they pro-
vided $970,500 to 92 different nonprofits. 
Since then, they have disbursed three addi-
tional rounds of funding to aid in Jefferson 
County’s recovery. 
I applaud Community First Foundation for 
their incredible work and commitment to our 
community and congratulate them on being 
recognized as the Behind the Scenes Award 
winner by the Arvada Chamber of Commerce.

HONORING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
SORAYA 
CORREA, 
CHIEF 
PRO-
CUREMENT OFFICER OF THE DE-
PARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECU-
RITY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor Soraya Correa, the 
Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) 
Chief Procurement Officer, upon her retire-
ment from Federal service. 
Ms. Correa has been a dedicated public 
servant for more than four decades. She start-
ed her Federal career as a clerk typist for con-
struction contracts in 1980 and rose through 
the ranks to serve in leadership positions at 
several different agencies, including the Gen-
eral Services Administration and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Ms. 
Correa has been with DHS since its inception. 
She served as an executive within DHS’s Of-
fice of Procurement Operations, Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Citizen-
ship and Immigration Services before she was 
appointed Chief Procurement Officer of the 
Department in January 2015. 
Ms. Correa has been a driving force in ma-
turing DHS’s management functions and has 
forged a reputation as one of the Federal gov-
ernment’s most innovative procurement lead-
ers. She has led several initiatives at DHS fo-
cused on building a highly qualified acquisition 
workforce that is empowered to take smart 
risks to procure what the Department needs. 
For example, she created the Procurement In-
novation Lab in March 2015 as a testbed for 
new acquisition techniques aimed at improving 
the Department’s procurement process and 
saving taxpayer dollars. In 2016, Ms. Correa 
and her team were awarded the prestigious 
DHS Secretary’s Award for Excellence for this 
effort. 
As Chairman of the Committee on Home-
land Security, I have come to appreciate Ms. 
Correa’s steadfast commitment to fostering an 
open dialogue with industry and promoting op-
portunities for small, disadvantaged, and mi-
nority-owned businesses that face barriers to 
entering the Federal marketplace. Under her 
leadership, DHS has continued to earn an ‘‘A’’ 
grade on the Small Business Administration’s 
Small Business Procurement Scorecard; a 
grade it has earned for a total of 11 years in 
a row. 
Ms. Correa has received many accolades 
from both industry and government throughout 
her career, including the 2018 Presidential 
Rank Award for Distinguished Service. We 
thank Ms. Correa for her service to our coun-
try and wish her the very best in her retire-
ment.

HONORING AUBREY ALVAREZ AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Aubrey Alvarez, the executive 
director of Eat Greater Des Moines, as Iowan 
of the Week. Since its founding in 2013, Au-
brey and the Eat Greater Des Moines team 
have helped connect numerous nonprofit orga-
nizations, businesses, and community leaders 
to work to strengthen the food system in Des 
Moines. 
Aubrey, who holds a degree in health and 
wellness management from the University of 
Northern Iowa and a Master of Public Admin-
istration degree from Drake University, has 
worked in various health and wellness posi-
tions throughout her professional career. Now, 
Aubrey works with the Eat Greater Des

Moines team to make sure no food goes to 
waste. They emphasize the use of local foods 
and community gardens, and have a food res-
cue system to make sure restaurants and gro-
cery stores don’t throw away good food. Their 
work has also proved fruitful as they have 
supported 90 community, school, and faith 
based edible gardens. 
One of the organization’s biggest projects, 
Operation Fresh Produce Drop, started in April 
2020 in response to the strains put on the 
food system due to unexpected closures and 
an increase in need for food. The Operation 
Fresh Produce Drop initiative began as a way 
to help move excess bulk products from 
wholesale distributors while also supporting or-
ganizations serving those affected by the pan-
demic. This evolved into distributing almost 
90,000 food boxes through the USDA Farms 
to Families food box program. With a team of 
3 full-time staff and no warehouse space or 
necessary 
equipment, 
Operation 
Fresh 
Produce Drop was only possible due to col-
laborations with local partners like Des Moines 
Public Schools and Forklifts of Des Moines. 
Of the over 125 groups Eat Greater Des 
Moines worked with, 80 percent were not and 
are still not able to order or access food 
through the Feeding America food bank net-
work or TEFAP, which makes the work Eat 
Greater Des Moines is doing to partner with 
trusted community members to get food to in-
dividuals and families even more important. 
Aubrey is committed to not only making 
sure individuals and families in Des Moines 
don’t go hungry, but that they also have ac-
cess to fresh and healthy foods. It’s impos-
sible to tell how many people Aubrey’s work 
has affected directly, but I do know that be-
cause of her families have and are still able to 
put delicious, fresh food on their tables. It is 
an honor to commemorate Aubrey and recog-
nize her as the Iowan of the Week.

TRIBUTE TO MELVIN BORTON 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the life and accomplishments of 
Melvin Borton. Mel passed from this life on 
July 16 at the age of 94, having dedicated six 
decades to the betterment of farmers in Ohio 
and across this Nation through his skilled 
leadership with the Ohio Farmers Union and 
National Farmers Union. 
Mel’s passion for agriculture began at an 
early age. He grew up on a family farm, where 
he helped his brother cultivate everything from 
tomatoes to wheat. In 1948, four years after 
his graduation from Chesterfield High School, 
Mel began a fanning operation of his own and 
joined the Farmers Union. 
By the end of the 1960’s, Mel pursued a 
new endeavor: lifting up the voices of his fel-
low farmers as a National Farmers Union 
leader. He served as both a regional director 
and the national director of organization and 
field services for the National Farmers Union 
before returning to Ohio to serve as the Ohio 
Farm Union’s director of marketing. 
After nearly two decades of service to the 
Ohio Farm Union, Mel Borton served as the 
state committee Chairman of the United 
States Department of Agriculture’s Farm Serv-
ice Agency. In this role, he advocated for 
farmers enrolled in federal farm programs. 
Without his efforts, the National Farmers 
Union and Ohio Farm Union wouldn’t be what 
they are today. In 2013, Mr. Borton’s tremen-
dous efforts were recognized by the National 
Farmers Union as they awarded him its Meri-
torious Service Award—the top award be-
stowed by the organization—for his contribu-
tions to agriculture, humanity, and the union. 
Despite his numerous accolades and ac-
complishments, Mel Borton was a humble and 
soft-spoken gentleman. Ungregarious by na-
ture, he cared most about looking out for the 
most vulnerable among us, recognizing that 
our communities are only as strong as their 
weakest link. His vigilance, perseverance, and 
compassion were palpable during our frequent 
visits. 
Everyone who had the pleasure and privi-
lege of knowing Mel Borton knew that he, 
above all else, was utterly passionate about 
agriculture and the plight of small farmers. He 
made sure others were taken care of before 
himself and lived a life a true service. 
Melvin Borton’s legacy will live on forever 
through those that he touched throughout his 
life. The great state of Ohio and our Nation 
are better because of his contributions. To his 
wife, Linda, his family and friends, we offer our 
deepest condolences as they mourn the loss 
of this treasure of a man.

AMY POWELL 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Amy Powell for being 
awarded the 2020 Chamber Leader of the 
Year by the Arvada Chamber of Commerce. 
Amy has served the Arvada Chamber of 
Commerce with a sense of commitment and 
engagement over the past few years, including 
on several committees such as workforce, 
Leadership KAPS Council as well as pre-
sented on a variety of topics. 
Amy is also the founder of Well Works, 
which trains and coaches the construction in-
dustry professionals to address unique prob-
lems within their industry. She also spent 
many years at Golden Triangle Construction 
company where she held several different po-
sitions, including director of training and out-
reach. She earned her B.S. in Construction 
Management from Colorado State University 
as well as her Master’s in Adult Education and 
Training. 
When describing her job, she says, ‘‘I un-
derstand that there’s the people side of build-
ing and the building side of people.’’ She ex-
plains that in construction too often the focus 
is on the building and the money, but not the 
people. Amy understands the importance of a 
thriving business community and the power of 
people and is committed to ensuring that Ar-
vada is a topnotch community. Congratula-
tions to Amy Powell for being recognized as 
the 2020 Chamber Leader of the Year by the 
Arvada Chamber of Commerce. 
HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
COMMANDER MICHAEL FILES 
HON. LLOYD DOGGETT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, one of the 
most important honors we have as Members 
of Congress is to nominate candidates from a 
competitive pool of young men and women 
who want to attend our Nation’s elite military 
academies. Among the first I nominated was 
Michael Files, a James Bowie High School 
graduate from Austin, Texas, who sought ad-
mission to the United States Naval Academy. 
A nomination doesn’t guarantee admission or 
success, but Commander Files enjoyed both. 
It brings me great satisfaction to know that 
Commander Files has gone on to do so much 
on behalf of our Nation, in and out of the uni-
form, His service in the U.S. Navy, which led 
him all over world, such as Guam and Japan, 
earned him several awards such as the 2011 
Navy Times Sailor of the Year, the Meritorious 
Service Medal, the Joint Service Commenda-
tion Medal and many others. 
In addition to serving in the Armed Forces, 
Commander Files served his fellow neighbors 
as a Commissioner for the City of Alexandria 
Human Rights Commission. During his tenure 
from 2009 to 2011, Commander Files held 
public hearings related to housing discrimina-
tion and age discrimination in Employment— 
highlighting his dedication to civil rights. In re-
cent years, Commander Files has led the 
Navy Talent Acquisition Group in San Antonio 
where his team recruits high-quality can-
didates from Texas who are interested in join-
ing the U.S. Navy. 
Outside of his uniform, Commander Files is 
actively involved in the community, volun-
teering with organizations such as Big Broth-
ers Big Sisters, the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, 
Inc., and the NAACP. Commander Files’ ex-
emplary service to America and his local com-
munity is emblematic of what makes America 
a great Nation. 
I wish Commander Files the very best as he 
and his family celebrate his well-deserved re-
tirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
ROBERT WARD 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize and celebrate the life of Dr. Rob-
ert ‘‘Bob’’ Ward. Born on July 4, 1933 to Al 
and Lovera Ward in Huntington, California, 
Bob was one of six children. He would later 
graduate from Burbank High School, a school 
where he would develop his athleticism and 
deep faith, two traits that would become 
among his greatest attributes. 
Bob would go on to Whitworth University, 
earning All-Conference honors in both football 
and track and field while furthering his aca-
demic pursuits. Bob would later serve his 
country as a member of the United States Ma-
rine Corps, during which time he was on ac-
tive duty at Quantico and Camp Pendleton.

While in the service, Bob would many Joyce 
Ross, his lifelong partner. Following his time in 
the military, Bob would earn his master’s de-
gree at the University of Washington and 
would begin his impressive teaching and 
coaching career at both the high school and 
collegiate levels. Under his leadership, the 
Fullerton College track team would earn five 
conference titles and a state championship, 
leading to Ward’s induction into the College’s 
Coaching Hall of Fame. 
Always the learner, Bob would seek out new 
and innovative techniques to push his athletes 
to the next level. His constant quest for knowl-
edge would lead him to Indiana University, 
where he earned his Doctorate in Bio-
mechanics. This drive would soon be noticed 
by the Dallas Cowboys, where over the next 
14 years he would become one of the most 
respected and celebrated strength coaches in 
the NFL during the notable Landry years. 
Continuing his lifelong love of athletic com-
petition, Dr. Ward competed in various Mas-
ters Track and Field competitions well into his 
80s, earning world records in the 70–74 age 
group in weightlifting and various pentathlon 
weight events in track. Bob would co-author 
several books on sports training and a book 
on his life journey, Building the Perfect Star. 
While Bob’s professional achievements in-
clude an awe-inspiring list of accolades, his 
greatest achievement was his family. Bob was 
blessed with two daughters, six grandchildren, 
and five great-grandchildren, as well as a life-
time of partnership with his wife, Joyce. 
Now as we recognize Dr. Bob Ward, I ask 
my colleagues in the House of Representa-
tives to join me in honoring his rich life and 
legacy.

AVASARALA KANYAKUMARI 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I wish to honor the life and talent of 
Avasarala Kanyakumari, a revered master vio-
linist, composer, and teacher in the Indian 
Carnatic musical tradition. 
Born in the city of Guntur in Andhra 
Pradesh, India, Kanyakumari began her musi-
cal life on the violin at the age of eight. 
Blessed with an abundance of natural talent 
and nurtured by her family and dedicated 
teachers—including the eminent violinist Mae-
stro Ivaturi Vijayeswara Rao—Kanyakumari 
was soon performing in small concerts and 
building a reputation as a musical prodigy. 
After graduating high school, Kanyakumari 
moved to Chennai, where she continued her 
education and her musical career as an ac-
companist and soloist of great renown, deeply 
admired by critics and aficionados alike for her 
technical skill and exquisite musicality. 
The Indian Government recognized her tal-
ent and contributions to Indian music and cul-
ture with the Padma Shri Award in 2015. The 
following year, Kanyakumari was honored with 
the Kalaimamani Award from the state of 
Tamil Nadu, and the prestigious Sangita 
Kalanidhi Award from the Madras Music Acad-
emy. 
Kanyakumari is revered for her commitment 
to cultivating the next generation of Carnatic 
musicians. She offers her services without 
charge, as her way of paying it forward and 
honoring the contributions made by her teach-
ers 
to 
developing 
her 
talents. 
And 
Kanyakumari is a wonderful musical ambas-
sador, sharing the beauty of the Carnatic tradi-
tion with music lovers all over the world. (I 
was especially moved by a recent rendition of 
the Star-Spangled Banner on this Fourth of 
July, performed by Kanyakumari and her stu-
dent disciples.) 
Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the 
contributions of maestro, guru, and composer 
Avasarala Kanyakumari to Indian music and 
culture, and the gift of her talent to the millions 
of devotees of the Carnatic musical tradition.

EPIC EXPERIENCE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Epic Experience for being 
recognized as the 2020 Non-Profit of the Year 
by the Arvada Chamber of Commerce. 
Epic Experience was founded in 2012 by 
Nancy Ferro and Abby Staible, after Nancy’s 
eldest son Michael received a testicular can-
cer diagnosis. This experience led the two of 
them to establish Epic Experience, an Arvada- 
based non-profit with the goal of empowering 
adult cancer survivors to live and thrive be-
yond cancer. They empower their members by 
offering workshops and camps to individuals 
who are dealing with a cancer diagnosis as a 
way to help cope with the mental and physical 
ramifications of these diagnoses. These expe-
riences often provide a weeklong trip in the 
Rocky Mountains and allows patients and sur-
vivors a chance to challenge themselves phys-
ically, share their experiences with fellow sur-
vivors, and find community during a difficult 
time. 
Since their beginning in 2012, Epic Experi-
ence has raised over $2.5 million dollars and 
helped nearly 5,000 cancer survivors and 
thrivers. They have seen tremendous success 
with their program reporting 95 percent of 
campers having an improvement in their men-
tal health after attending a camp or workshop. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic hit, Epic Ex-
perience demonstrated their resiliency by 
transforming its traditional in person camping 
seminars to a virtual setting to protect its im-
mune-compromised population. In addition, 
Epic Experience offered free online yoga, 
training, and how-to videos as well as three- 
day virtual seminars to help maintain the close 
connections and support the non-profit pro-
vides so many. 
Epic Experience reflects and embodies the 
compassion, love, and sense of community 
that is well-known in Arvada and is so impor-
tant for cancer survivors. The success of Epic 
Experience has led to life-changing, positive 
impacts for so many and given individuals a 
great quality of life as they survive and thrive 
beyond cancer. Congratulations to Epic Expe-
rience for their hard work and dedication to 
our community and for receiving the Non-Profit 
of the Year award from the Arvada Chamber 
of Commerce. 
HONORING TOM FLORES 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
along with my colleagues, Mr. RUIZ and Mr. 
SOTO, to recognize Mr. Tom Flores for his 
successful career and outstanding achieve-
ments in professional football. 
Tom Flores was born in Fresno and raised 
in Sanger, California. He is a son of immi-
grants who had humbled beginnings working 
in the agriculture fields of the San Joaquin 
Valley. He attended Fresno City College, 
where he played as quarterback for two sea-
sons and then received an academic scholar-
ship to study at the University of the Pacific. 
Following his graduation, Flores sought to 
pursue a career in professional football. For 
him, like others, it was not easy. He was cut 
by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian 
Football League in 1958, and then by the 
Washington Redskins of the National Football 
League (NFL) in 1959. But that did not stop 
him: he persisted until his dream became a re-
ality. 
In 1960, Flores became the first Hispanic 
quarterback in American professional football 
after winning the starting quarterback job with 
the American Football League’s Oakland Raid-
ers. He later played for the Buffalo Bills and 
the Kansas City Chiefs. He won his first Super 
Bowl ring in 1969 playing quarterback for the 
Kansas City Chiefs. After a successful playing 
career, he retired, following the 1970 season. 
Subsequently, Flores served as an assistant 
coach with the Buffalo Bills and Oakland Raid-
ers. In 1979, he became the Raiders head 
coach and the first Hispanic head coach in 
NFL history. Under his leadership, the Raiders 
won the 1980 Super Bowl XV and 1983 Super 
Bowl XVIII. Tom Flores has four Super Bowl 
rings and is one of two individuals that earned 
that honor as a player, assistant coach, and 
head coach. 
Coach Flores joined the Raiders front office 
after the 1987 season. A year later, he be-
came President and General Manager of the 
Seattle Seahawks. In 1992, he returned to the 
sideline as the head coach of the Seahawks 
for three seasons. In twelve seasons as a 
head coach, Flores compiled a career record 
of 97–87 and an impressive playoff record of 
8–3, surpassed only by the legendary coach 
Vince Lombardi. He later returned to the Raid-
ers, where he spent more than two decades 
as a radio analyst. 
After a successful career in football, both as 
a player and coach, Flores has used his influ-
ence to raise nearly 2 million dollars to sup-
port Sanger Unified School District’s science, 
art, and athletics programs through the Tom 
Flores Foundation. Demonstrating a commit-
ment to giving back to our communities and 
nation. 
Coach Flores was selected to be enshrined 
as a member of the Class of 2021 for the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame, an honor well deserved 
and overdue. He will be the third Raiders 
Head Coach in the Hall of Fame. The Class 
of 2021 will be enshrined on Sunday, August 
8, 2021, in Canton, Ohio. 
Today, he remains active with the Raiders, 
now in Las Vegas, Nevada. Through his illus-
trious athletic career and commitment to his

me in congratulating Tom Flores. We recog-
nize his successful career and contributions to 
society, look forward to his enshrinement in 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

RECOGNIZING REGINA WILLIAMS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Ms. Regina Wil-
liams on being named 2020 Historian of the 
Year by the Bedford County Historical Society. 
Throughout the past year, Ms. Regina Wil-
liams has kept the history of Bedford County 
alive through her work to maintain social 
media pages dedicated to preserving our local 
history. 
Her love of Bedford County goes beyond 
social media, as she has led hikes to the his-
torical salt cave in Sweet Root Park, as well 
as the Imes Cemetery. She has also created 
education 
programs 
about 
Southampton 
Township for the Bedford County Leadership 
Group. Furthermore, Ms. Regina Williams has 
worked tirelessly to restore the Point Pleasant 
School in Southampton Township. 
Ms. Regina Williams’ work has greatly im-
pacted the people of Bedford County for the 
better and her commitment to sharing our 
community’s history is unmatched. On behalf 
of the 13th District of Pennsylvania, I con-
gratulate Ms. Regina Williams on being named 
2020 Historian of the Year and wish her con-
tinued success in her work to tell the story of 
Bedford County.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MR. HIRAM ‘‘H’’ BOWLIN 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Mr. Hiram ‘‘H’’ Bowlin, who 
is a distinguished veteran that served our 
country in World War II and recently cele-
brated his 101st birthday on June 7, 2021. I 
extend my sincerest gratitude to Hiram for his 
dedicated service to our country, and I further 
thank him for his continued service to our 
community. I am delighted to wish him a very 
happy and joyful 101st birthday. 
Hiram’s service began when he was sent to 
Europe and assigned to the 94th Infantry, 
which was a part of the 3rd Army commanded 
by the great General George Patton. This in-
fantry saw a total of 209 days of combat and 
participated in campaigns in Northern France, 
Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Eu-
rope. Hiram served as a Communications Ser-
geant and was responsible for stringing 
‘‘commo wire’’ to different command posts dur-
ing the war. 
He was discharged January 16, 1946, and 
he returned home to the U.S. on February 6, 
1946. For his service, Hiram has been award-
ed the Bronze Star, the World War II Victory 
Medal, Good Conduct Medal, and the M–1 
Rifle Marksmanship Badge Medal, among 
other awards. 
Hiram is described by his friends as a man 
of God who is beloved by his community. He 
often exchanges a warm smile and friendly 
wave with his neighbors as they pass by his 
home. He spent his 101st birthday surrounded 
by his friends and loved ones and even got 
the opportunity to ride in an antique fire truck 
that is as old as Hiram himself. When asked 
about the secret to living a long life by a local 
reporter, 
Hiram 
jokingly 
quipped, 
‘‘Keep 
breathing.’’ 
Hiram is a blessing to everyone that knows 
him, and he has made a large impact on our 
community. He is known as a kind, caring 
man who loves Jesus. Veterans like Hiram are 
the backbone of our nation, and we owe them 
our sincerest gratitude. His service and sac-
rifice are a testament to his character and his 
deep love for our country. I want to extend my 
deepest thanks to Hiram for his dedicated 
service to our nation, and once again, wish 
him a very happy birthday.

KAT DOUGLAS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kat Douglas for being 
awarded the 2020 Arvada Chamber of Com-
merce’s Chairman’s Choice Award. 
As the Director of Jefferson County Commu-
nity and Workforce Development, she has led 
the workforce, housing, homeless and Vet-
erans program while supporting the economic 
vitality of the community and region. During 
the COVID–19 pandemic, Kat and her teams 
supported the ongoing response and recovery 
efforts, along with their strong partner network, 
across Jefferson County. Specifically, Kat and 
her team helped manage the small business 
grant program, the Business and Economic 
Recovery Task Force, and the five-star certifi-
cation program. The five-star certification pro-
gram allowed certified businesses to open at 
a larger capacity, providing them with the abil-
ity to serve more customers and helping their 
bottom line following a difficult year. The proc-
ess helped the Jefferson County community 
identify businesses as safe and responsible 
during 
times 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
helped 
jumpstart the economic recovery for busi-
nesses that were hit hard during the COVID– 
19 pandemic and the region in general. 
Kat’s work to help businesses and the econ-
omy of Jefferson County—as well as her more 
than 17 years in Jefferson County govern-
ment—is remarkable and clearly demonstrates 
her as a leader in our community and some-
one works hard to serve the needs of our resi-
dents and businesses. Thank Kat Douglas for 
her hard work and dedication to our commu-
nity, and congratulate her on receiving the Ar-
vada Chamber’s Chairman’s Choice Award. 
COMMEMORATING ASSYRIAN 
MEMORIAL DAY 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate Assyrian Memorial 
Day, which is observed annually on August 7 
to honor the memory of all those Assyrians 
who have fallen victim to genocide, other 
mass atrocities, and persecution. I am very 
proud that the Second Congressional District 
of Massachusetts is home to a vibrant Assyr-
ian-American community—a proud reminder of 
survival and perseverance in the face of mass 
atrocities and extreme injustice. 
The Genocide that we are commemorating 
today is a history of persecution and the sys-
tematic destruction of a people, based on their 
religion and ethnicity. It is a history shared 
with Armenians and Hellenes, or Greeks, per-
petrated between 1914 and 1923. This is the 
period that began to form the world’s modern- 
day understanding of crimes against humanity 
and genocide, culminating 20 years later in 
the atrocities committed against the Jewish 
people of Europe. 
Madam Speaker, today is a moment to re-
member the hundreds of thousands of Assyr-
ians who perished during this horror were irre-
placeable human beings. Each individual— 
man or woman, children or the elderly—were 
part of a family, with dreams and hopes for 
the future—and all those hopes, all of those 
dreams, all of those ‘‘possibilities’’ were 
erased. This was done deliberately. This was 
a choice made by leaders at all levels of the 
Ottoman Empire and those who took charge 
immediately after the empire’s demise. 
The Assyrian people and the Assyrian 
Catholic Church have existed for over 2,000 
years. In their ancestral homes of the Middle 
East—in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey—they lived 
and worshipped, established communities, and 
broke bread together, centuries before Islam 
was born in the region. 
Sadly, the minority religions and peoples of 
the Middle East are facing yet another test, as 
they are again being persecuted and targeted 
for extinction. Most of the world’s 2 to 4 million 
Assyrians still live around their traditional 
homelands, although they are frequently dis-
placed and fleeing violence and war like so 
many others in the region. It is estimated that 
some 60 percent of Iraqi Assyrians have been 
forced to abandon their homes and leave the 
country since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. 
Today, tens of thousands of Assyrians in 
Northern Iraq have fled persecution at the 
hands of ISIS, which has attacked Assyrian 
villages, killing or imprisoning hundreds. And 
with ISIS has come another form of geno-
cide—the war against the history of mankind— 
with the destruction of archaeological sites, 
ancient books, artifacts, works of art, houses 
of worship, museums, centuries-old Bibles, 
and relics. Yet, we can take hope from the 
survival of towns like Alqosh in northern Iraq 
and the Nineveh Plains. People survive and 
the culture and memory survive. 
We cannot sit idly by and watch this de-
struction continue. We need to provide aid and 
protection to these communities, these villages 
and towns—certainly for the sake of the As-
syrian and other Christian minorities defiantly

surviving the bloodbath raging around them, 
but also for the sake of our shared humanity. 
And clearly, the Assyrian culture and reli-
gion survive within all of those who, over the 
centuries, fled the region and made new lives 
in strange lands, including right here in the 
United States and in Massachusetts. And what 
a wealth of history, culture, and religion they 
have brought to us, enriching our communities 
and our public life. 
Part of that history is St. Mary’s Assyrian 
Apostolic Church which was built on Hawley 
Street in Worcester in 1924. I have read that 
it was built by about 30 Assyrian families who 
came to Massachusetts from southern Turkey. 
They were joined in later decades by Assyr-
ians from Turkey, Lebanon, and Syria, and 
more recently, from Iraq. I knew that church. 
It was a wonderful place. But a couple of 
years ago, it moved to its new home in 
Shrewsbury, which luckily, is also part of my 
congressional district. 
And like the Assyrian American Association 
of Massachusetts Cultural Center in North 
Grafton, it is a place of community and a 
place of defiance, of resistance, in the best 
meaning of those words—a place where cul-
ture and religion and human potential are val-
ued, remembered, renewed, and strength-
ened. 
So, while I rise to commemorate the tragedy 
of the past and to honor its enduring memory, 
I also celebrate the strength of the Assyrian- 
American community and the hopes of their 
future, and their children’s futures. 
In 2015, the Assyrian-American community 
of Massachusetts dedicated a monument 
called ‘‘Hope.’’ Hope gives us life, gives us 
purpose, and a reason to look forward to to-
morrow. 
For centuries, Assyrians have survived per-
secution and some of the greatest evils known 
to 
humankind. 
But 
far 
from 
being 
exterminated, the Assyrian people—their reli-
gion and their culture—continue to survive and 
thrive.

HONORING PASTOR CHAD D. 
BRYANT 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a dedicated community 
leader, an outstanding Man of God, and a 
dear friend of longstanding, Pastor Chad D. 
Bryant who is retiring and celebrating his 40th 
anniversary as the distinguished pastor of 
Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Columbus, 
Georgia. An anniversary worship service will 
be held on Sunday, August 8, 2021 at 3 p.m. 
at the church located at 3601 Yeomans Street 
in Columbus, Georgia. 
A native son of Columbus, Georgia, Pastor 
Chad D. Bryant was born to the late William 
Bryant, Sr. and Mattie Bryant. Pastor Bryant 
began his Christian journey after accepting 
Jesus at the age of 8. At the age of 16, he 
confessed a calling to the preaching ministry 
and by 18, he was ordained—all of which hap-
pened under the tutelage of the late Reverend 
C.C. Cloud of New Providence Baptist Church 
in Columbus, Georgia. Pastor Bryant received 
his grade school education in the public 
schools of Columbus, Georgia before grad-
uating from Spencer High School in 1974. He 
then went on to attend Morris Brown College, 
where he studied Sociology with an emphasis 
in Psychology. He also received a certificate in 
Church Administration and the Old and New 
Testaments from the American Baptist Theo-
logical Seminary in Columbus, Georgia. 
In addition to being the beloved pastor of 
Mount Pleasant Baptist Church and a founding 
active member of the Fellowship Missionary 
Baptist Convention of Georgia, Inc., he has 
also served as Assistant Pastor of Galilee 
Baptist Church; Associate Minister of Greater 
Beallwood 
and 
New 
Providence 
Baptist 
Churches in Columbus Georgia; a former in-
structor of the American Baptist College Ex-
tension Center; Assistant Director-General and 
Director-General for the Congress of Christian 
Education; and President and Dean of the 
Fourth District Congress of Christian Edu-
cation under the General Missionary Baptist 
Convention of Georgia, Inc. 
George Washington Carver once said, ‘‘How 
far you go in life depends on your being ten-
der with the young, compassionate with the 
aged, sympathetic with the striving and toler-
ant of the weak and strong because someday 
in your life you will have been all of these.’’ 
Pastor Bryant has gone far in life because his 
everlasting faith in the Lord is a vivid testi-
mony of His greatness to all whom he encoun-
ters. His love and commitment to Christ are 
reflected in his compassionate and consid-
erate leadership, which makes him a guiding 
light within the community. He is a humble 
man who always puts himself in the shoes of 
others. It has been said that, ‘‘The true person 
of success is not the person that climbs the 
ladder of this life with one hand, but climbs the 
ladder of this life with two hands and reaches 
back with the other.’’ Pastor Bryant has al-
ways climbed the ladder of life with an eye to-
wards helping others to reach their full poten-
tial, both spiritually and socially. 
On a personal level, Pastor Bryant has been 
a friend and supporter for many, many years, 
and his friendship, advice, and counsel have 
always been valued by me. I am grateful and 
honored to be able to call him my friend. 
Today I ask my colleagues to join my wife, 
Vivian, and me, along with the congregation of 
Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, and the more 
than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second 
Congressional District in honoring and com-
mending Pastor Chad D. Bryant on his out-
standing career and upon the occasion of his 
retirement. We wish him well as he begins a 
new chapter in his life.

AMENDMENT TO DIVISION E OF 
H.R. 4502 
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to Division E of 
H.R. 4502, which provides funding for the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, for fis-
cal year 2022. The purpose of this amend-
ment is to highlight the need for additional fi-
nancial resources for our rural water systems 
to address lead in drinking water. 
It was recently reported that the drinking 
water at three locations in Clarksburg, West 
Virginia, contained lead levels above 15 parts 
per billion, which is EPA’s action level for lead 
contamination. The Clarksburg Water Board, 
CWB has done everything in its power to ad-
dress the issue at hand, yet they are still con-
strained and need assistance to address this 
issue. The $8,804,000 this amendment sub-
tracts and adds back to the funding level for 
capitalization grants under the Drinking Water 
State Revolving Fund is the total amount the 
CWB would need to replace their water lines 
and improve their drinking water distribution 
system. By highlighting this needed funding, 
Congress will ensure that our rural water sys-
tems are given the assistance they deserve.

Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Flatirons Dance as the 
2020 Business of the Year by the Arvada 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Flatirons Dance was founded in 2016 by 
Jessica Fitzgerald. As director of the studio, 
she worked to create a studio based on family 
values and her classes highlight the impor-
tance of teamwork, collaboration, and positive 
group interaction. Additionally, classes provide 
a high-quality dance instruction by teaching 
the history, vocabulary, technique, and cultural 
context behind dance. Classes help students 
in their day-to-day life by providing structured 
and supportive interactions, practice problem 
solving, and experience building academic and 
artistic skills. 
Flatirons’ 
more 
than 
20 
professionally 
trained staff members work to make a nur-
turing, inclusive and welcoming environment 
for all of their students. Today, Flatirons offers 
both adult and children’s classes and serves 
more than 400 students each year. Students 
have the opportunity to study many styles of 
dance including jazz, ballet, tap, hip hop, and 
musical theatre. For students looking for a 
larger commitment, Flatirons offers a competi-
tion team and a cheer program. Each student 
has the opportunity to showcase what they 
have learned in a presentation to peers, 
teachers, families, and the community each 
session. 
I applaud Flatirons Dance for their work to 
make a difference in the lives of their students 
every day and their commitment to our com-
munity. Congratulations on being awarded 
Business of the Year by the Arvada Chamber 
of Commerce.

a community icon serving over 17 different fla-
vors of handcrafted beer at multiple locations 
here in Wichita. 
From humble beginnings, Jeremy and Greg 
have built WBC into a Kansas brand with two 
brew-pub locations, a wholesale production fa-
cility, and a 9,000 square-foot event venue. 
These locations provide Kansans of all walks 
of life a place to sit down and enjoy a pizza 
and a beer alongside their family, friends, and 
neighbors. Beyond its local reach, WBC has 
been recognized by The Brewers Association 
as one of the country’s 50 fastest growing 
breweries, with deliveries to bars and liquor 
stores in Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Oklahoma, Wyoming. WBC also took home a 
silver medal for one of its beers at the 2017 
Great American Beer Festival, considered to 
be the Academy Awards of the craft beer in-
dustry, the most significant, most competitive, 
and most respected contest. 
More importantly, Jeremy, Greg, and the en-
tire Wichita Brewing Family continue to give 
back to their community through the charitable 
events and fundraisers that they sponsor and 
host. For the past 5 years, WBC has orga-
nized a marathon through Wichita that has 
raised thousands of dollars for the Kansas 
Food Bank. Further, during the COVID–19 
pandemic, WBC has made and provided no- 
cost hand sanitizer to first responders, law en-
forcement, and the Wichita Public Schools. 
Madam Speaker, I hope you will join me in 
honoring WBC on their 10th anniversary an 
wishing them further success.

FOR 
29 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE TO CABARRUS COUNTY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Captain Laura Heggins for 29 years 
of service to Cabarrus County, located in 
North Carolina’s Eighth Congressional District. 
Captain Heggins began her career in law 
enforcement with the Cabarrus County Sher-
iff’s Office in 1992 and retires today as Cap-
tain of the Administrative Support Services Di-
vision, where she oversaw all operations re-
lated to School Recourse Officers, Records, 
Civil Process and Training and Recruitment. 
Captain Heggins has led a career of distinc-
tion and is a strong and effective leader. She 
became the first African American and the first 
woman to rise to the rank of Captain with the 
Cabarrus County Sheriff’s Office, paving the 
way for and inspiring others. During her tenure 
with Cabarrus County, she supervised the 
daily operations and personnel of the Court-
house Security and Bailiff Division, led all 
courthouse safety operations, managed the re-
cruitment and hiring of all personnel for the 
Cabarrus County Sheriff’s Office, served as 
the Team Leader of the Crisis/Hostage Nego-
tiator Team, and was instrumental in the de-
velopment and oversight of the College Intern 
Program. In addition to her work with 
Cabarrus County, she also serves as a mem-
ber of the Cabarrus County Mental Health 
Task Force, works with homeless populations 
through Main Street Mission, teaches a Deten-
tion Officers Certification Course and is an ac-
tive member of Oak Grove Baptist Church. 
Renee and I would like to extend our most 
heartfelt appreciation to Captain Heggins for 
her years of exemplary service to Cabarrus 
County, which is a better place today due to 
her work. I know I speak for our entire com-
munity in wishing her and her family continued 
success and happiness as they move on to 
their next great adventure. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Captain Laura Heggins for 29 years 
of service to Cabarrus County.

HONORING MR. DALE NASH UPON 
HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the career of Mr. Dale K. Nash, who is 
retiring on August 1 after serving as CEO and 
Executive Director of the Virginia Commercial 
Space Flight Authority, or ‘‘Virginia Space,’’ 
since 2012. 
During Mr. Nash’s tenure as CEO, Virginia 
Space, which owns and operates the Mid-At-
lantic Regional Spaceport, MARS, at Wallops 
Island, Virginia, has grown to include a state- 
of-the-art payload processing facility and a 
purpose-built UAS runway. Under Nash, Vir-
ginia Space has also produced three launch 
pads that support cargo resupply missions to 
the International Space Station and Lunar 
science missions for NASA, as well as na-
tional security payload processing and launch 
services for the Department of Defense. Most 
recently, Mr. Nash was instrumental in attract-
ing Rocket Lab USA to base its U.S. oper-
ations from MARS, which will accelerate the 
expansion and promotion of the commercial 
and government aerospace industry in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia. 
Mr. Nash’s time at the helm of Virginia 
Space is the culmination of a 38-year-long ca-
reer in the space industry that includes other 
prominent positions. Prior to his role with Vir-
ginia Space, Mr. Nash served as CEO of Alas-
ka Aerospace and its Kodiak Launch Com-
plex. He also held senior management posi-
tions on the Space Shuttle program and Orion 
program development with the United Space 
Alliance, Lockheed and Thiokol Corp. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in cele-
brating Mr. Nash upon the culmination of his 
impactful career. I am thankful for his dedica-
tion and service to our country’s space pro-
gram, and I wish him and his family the best 
of luck and much happiness in retirement.

RECOGNIZING DAVID AND AMY 
SNYDER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize David and Amy 
Snyder for being named 2019 Historians of 
the Year by the Bedford County Historical So-
ciety. 
Throughout 2018, David and Amy Snyder 
worked diligently to preserve and protect the 
history and heritage of Bedford County 
through the renovation of the Loy Mansion. 
The Snyder family first began their research 
project into the property’s history in 2017, and 
their extensive diligence in researching the 
history of the mansion has led to a better un-
derstanding of the Loy Family, for whom the 
Village of Loy is named. 
David and Amy Snyder’s research into the 
history of the Loy Mansion has contributed to 
preserving the story of Bedford County for 
generations to come. I am grateful for their 
painstaking work to research our history and 
make that information accessible to the Bed-
ford County Historical Society and our commu-
nity’s schools. 
On behalf of the 13th District of Pennsyl-
vania, I congratulate them on their achieve-
ment and wish them continued success as 
they work to preserve the history of Bedford 
County.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E879 
August 6, 2021 
Program, part of the Office of Emergency 
Medical Services at the U.S Department of 
Transportation’s 
National 
Highway 
Traffic 
Safety Administration, NHTSA. On July 15, 
2021, NHTSA announced that she will retire 
from her position at the end of this calendar 
year. 
Laurie Flaherty has worked as an emer-
gency, trauma and flight nurse for more than 
20 years. In 2005, when the National 911 Pro-
gram was created by legislation I cosponsored 
and was signed into law in the 108th Con-
gress, Laurie was asked to coordinate efforts 
to strengthen our nation’s 911 emergency 
communications systems. Much of her work 
has been collaborating with other federal 
agencies and national, state, and local organi-
zations to implement Next Generation 911, 
NG911, a digital infrastructure that will in-
crease the resilience of the nation’s 911 sys-
tems. 
‘‘We are greatly in debt to Laurie for her ini-
tiative and commitment to the 911 Program 
from its inception,’’ said Dr. Jon Krohmer, Di-
rector of NHTSA’s Office of Emergency Med-
ical Services. 
During Laurie’s tenure, the National 911 
Program coordinated with the 911 community, 
Congress, and federal agencies to implement 
911 grant programs and support information 
regarding funding opportunities, helped de-
velop model 911 legislation, and collaborated 
with 911 professionals to ensure a smooth 
transition to NG911. As a co-founder of the 
Congressional NextGen 9–1–1 Caucus in 
2003, I worked closely with Laurie for many 
years to achieve these important goals. 
Laurie Flaherty was highly successful in cre-
ating awareness about 911 at the federal 
level, both in representing 911’s interests and 
in helping departments like the U.S. Depart-
ment of Defense make progress toward both 
optimal 911 services and NG911. ‘‘Her strong 
leadership competencies—relationship build-
ing, communication, problem solving and deci-
sion making—have been extremely effective 
for the role she’s played,’’ said Krohmer. 
As a champion for 911, Laurie’s skill as a 
convener and collaborator has been widely 
recognized and appreciated. 
Kelli Merriweather of the Texas Commission 
on State Emergency Communications and 
President of the National Association of State 
911 Administrators stated, ‘‘Laurie has been 
an exceptional advocate for 911 throughout 
her career, and 911 programs and the people 
who support them across the country have 
greatly benefited from her dedication and vi-
sion for 911 and now NG911. She will be 
missed more than we can say, but she leaves 
the 911 community stronger and well prepared 
for the future.’’ 
Laurie Flaherty credits much of the success 
of the Program to the guidance and support of 
the many dedicated and focused 911 profes-
sionals she has had the pleasure to know, in 
both public and private sectors. ‘‘I am grateful 
for the individuals and organizations who have 
been such wonderful colleagues and friends, 
as we have worked together to improve 911 
systems nationwide,’’ said Flaherty. ‘‘This is 
especially true of the DOT’s support, which— 
absent any mandate—established a track 
record of more than 15 years of discretionary 
funding and staffing, exclusively for 911 
issues. That commitment created a single fed-
eral home for 911 issues that will last beyond 
any single person’s career.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring Laurie 
Flaherty for her extraordinary contributions to 
the safety of our nation as the National 911 
Program Coordinator and in wishing her every 
blessing in her well-deserved retirement.

RECOGNIZING EDWARD 
ZIPPERER’S 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 6, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize my friend, Edward 
Zipperer, of Savannah, Georgia for his 90th 
birthday on August 8. 
Ed has dedicated his life to improving the 
great state of Georgia. 
Born in Savannah, Georgia in 1931, Ed was 
raised on a farm south of US 17. He went on 
to play football at Savannah high school and 
earned a degree in agricultural engineering 
from the University of Georgia. 
Ed served in the Georgia State Senate from 
1967 to 1975 and was on 13 separate com-
mittees during his tenure. He also served as 
the president of Chatham County Farm Bu-
reau for 40 years. Some of his accomplish-
ments include bringing new state parks and 
recreational areas to our Coastal Georgia 
community. 
Throughout his career, Ed remained com-
mitted to conserving and protecting the beau-
tiful lands of South Georgia. 
I am proud to rise today to honor Ed for his 
decades of leadership, and commitment to our 
country.
