nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no

f 
HONORING SEARA BURTON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
to honor fallen Richmond Police Offi-
cer Seara Burton. 
Officer Burton was an exceptional 
law enforcement officer who never 
failed to answer the call with bravery. 
Our Richmond police officer passed 
away Sunday night, September 18, with 
her family and loved ones close by. Her 
Richmond community proudly knows 
her as a fighter and a warrior—a title 
she very much deserved. 
She was well-loved and will be well- 
remembered by all whose lives she 
touched. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to pray 
for her loved ones and fellow officers as 
they grieve during this difficult time. 
HONORING CORPORAL KELSEE LAINHART 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Corporal Kelsee Lainhart. 
Corporal Lainhart was one of the U.S. 
servicemembers injured by the Kabul 
Airport bombings a little over 1 year 
ago in Afghanistan, but today, I am 
here to provide a more hopeful update. 
Though she spent many weeks in the 
hospital, our brave young marine from 
Dearborn County never lost hope. This 
August Corporal Lainhart participated 
in the Chicago Paratriathlon and fin-
ished fifth. 
So, Madam Speaker, I would like to 
honor Corporal Kelsee Lainhart today 
for her strength in recovery and her 
bravery and diligence during her dif-
ficult times. 
HONORING PETER MCDANIEL 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and recognize the late Peter 
McDaniel. Peter McDaniel’s legacy and 
the lives that he touched will live on in 
his community. 
After serving his country for 4 years 
in the Marine Corps, Mr. McDaniel 
served his community in many capac-
ities, including 22 years with the Rich-
mond 
Fire 
Department. 
Peter 
McDaniel was not just a public servant 
but also a son, husband, father, and 
grandfather. His selflessness and dedi-
cation will serve as an example and a 
legacy to uphold. We are proud to 
honor his life today. 
LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, this sum-
mer our pride and excitement rose as 
we beheld the events of this year’s Lit-
tle League World Series. 
Indiana’s own Hagerstown in the In-
diana Sixth District represented the 
Great Lakes region in this year’s 
games. Indiana has celebrated this 
team from the beginning, and we 
couldn’t be prouder for their success. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to simply 
say thank you to these outstanding 
young Hoosiers who took their Hagers-
town team to the 2022 Little League 
World Series. 
PROXY VOTING 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to call on the Speaker of the House to 
end proxy voting once and for all. 
Just this Sunday, President Joe 
Biden took to prime-time television to 
declare the COVID–19 pandemic over, 
thank God. 
In any other job in America, if you 
don’t show up, you get fired. I proudly 
say today that I never once proxy 
voted. It is not fair to our constituents 
who send us here to be their voice or to 
the taxpayers whose hard-earned dol-
lars we are supposed to be responsible 
stewards of to not show up here. 
We all know why proxy voting keeps 
getting extended. It is so the majority 
leadership can control its members and 
limit the effectiveness of this people’s 
House. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter stating that it is time to end 
proxy voting, return to regular order, 
and get back to work on behalf of the 
American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7970 
September 20, 2022 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, September 20, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: I write in support of 
President Biden’s recent declaration that the 
COVID–19 pandemic has come to an end. In 
accordance with this important announce-
ment, I formally request the Speaker bring 
an end to the House proxy voting system and 
all pandemic related House rules enacted as 
part of House Resolution 8. It is far past time 
this legislative body returns in person to ful-
fill our constitutional duties on behalf of our 
constituents. 
As you are aware, House Resolution 8 pro-
vided unprecedented authority for Members 
of Congress to designate a colleague as a 
proxy to cast votes on the House floor on 
their behalf. For the first time in our na-
tion’s history, this body allowed a sitting 
Member of Congress to defer their constitu-
tional responsibilities to a Representative of 
another district. Since then, more than six 
thousand letters designating a proxy voting 
member have been submitted to the House 
Office of the Clerk bearing an official state-
ment of a member’s inability to physically 
attend proceedings in the House chamber due 
to the COVID–19 pandemic. Since President 
Biden rightfully declared an end to the pan-
demic, it seems fit to end a practice specifi-
cally put in place to accommodate the 
logistical challenges posed by COVID–19. 
The voting card entrusted to us here in 
Congress belongs to the people we represent. 
Over the course of one hundred and fifteen 
sessions of Congress, this body convened in 
times of war, pandemics, and national crises 
alike to fulfill our constitutional duties. 
Since the start of the COVID–19 pandemic 
two and a half years ago, essential workers, 
blue collar employees, first responders, food 
and restaurant industries, and many more 
have shown up to work each and every day to 
do their job. We in Congress should find the 
courage to do the same. 
Thank you for your attention to this im-
portant matter. 
Sincerely, 
GREG PENCE, 
Member of Congress. 
f 
DEMOCRATS ARE INVESTING IN 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate and recognize 
the good-paying jobs that will be cre-
ated by the historic investments Demo-
crats have recently made in America. 
What are the investments, you may 
ask? 
Well, let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act, 
and the CHIPS and Science Act. These 
are three key laws that will power 
America forward by creating jobs, jobs, 
and, yes, better-paying jobs. 
Since President Biden took office in 
January 2021, over 9.4 million jobs have 
been created. I will repeat that: 9.4 mil-
lion jobs. 
If we look closely at the numbers and 
reports of these three new laws, we get 
a preview of how many more jobs will 
be created under President Biden’s 
leadership. 
First is the Inflation Reduction Act. 
This bill has the power to create 9 mil-
lion new jobs over the next decade, 
nearly 1 million jobs each year, and 5 
million of these jobs will likely be new 
clean-energy jobs across America. 
Second, the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act will add 2 million 
new jobs per year over the next decade. 
Third, the CHIPS and Science Act 
will create more than 1 million con-
struction jobs over the next 6 years to 
build America’s semiconductor fac-
tories. 
All these laws work to create good- 
paying union construction jobs for 
plumbers, pipe fitters, electrical work-
ers, 
steel 
workers, 
laborers, 
elec-
tricians, and other trades for working 
people. 
These are the types of jobs that resi-
dents across my district, Texas 29, and 
millions of Americans across our Na-
tion proudly work to help keep their 
families together, to feed their chil-
dren, and to look to the future. These 
are the kinds of jobs that power Amer-
ica and its economic engine. 
House 
Democrats 
and 
President 
Biden understand that growing the 
middle class means creating better- 
paying jobs right here in our country. 
That is why we passed these monu-
mental laws. 
Under the leadership of President 
Biden, who is the most pro-worker and 
pro-union President in American his-
tory, we have also invested hundreds of 
millions of dollars in registered ap-
prenticeships and pre-apprenticeships 
to provide new opportunities for work-
ing people to get good-paying union 
jobs. 
President Biden knows it is not only 
about 
providing 
opportunities 
for 
Americans today, but it is also about 
planning for tomorrow’s generation of 
workers and having a better life for our 
children. 
I am proud President Biden is build-
ing a better America for generations to 
come by putting people over policy pol-
itics. Sadly, as House Democrats and 
the President are working to create 
better-paying jobs, the Republicans are 
job killers. They oppose this legisla-
tion because they only focus on con-
trolling women and their bodies. Demo-
crats trust women. 
So while Republicans are focused on 
their own power, House Democrats and 
President Biden remain laser focused 
on producing results for the American 
people, and Democrats are delivering 
big-time. 
f 
SUPPORT FOR BE PRO BE PROUD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, workforce 
development programs are spreading 
across the country because of organiza-
tions like Be Pro Be Proud. 
In March of 2016, Be Pro Be Proud 
was launched by the Arkansas Cham-
ber of Commerce and the Associated 
Industries of Arkansas to serve the fu-
ture leaders of America’s workforce 
more effectively. 
Thanks to Be Pro Be Proud, more 
young people know that they can find 
a good-paying job and have a successful 
career without going to college. They 
have learned that there are alter-
natives to a baccalaureate degree—al-
ternatives that can produce equal, if 
not better, outcomes. 
In June of this year, I had the privi-
lege of traveling to Arkansas and at-
tending the national Be Pro Be Proud 
conference 
alongside 
Representative 
FRENCH HILL and Senator JOHN BOOZ-
MAN. 
The progress that has been achieved 
to date by this organization is remark-
able, and in the realm of workforce de-
velopment, its gains are second to 
none. 
In February of this year, officials in 
North Carolina signed a contract that 
established a Be Pro Be Proud pilot 
program within the State. This is won-
derful news indeed. 
As you can probably tell, Mr. Speak-
er, this is truly a State-led effort that 
is a model to other States and becom-
ing a national movement, and it is one 
that is a force to be reckoned with. 
States need to know that the power 
is in their hands to implement strong 
and effective workforce development 
programs. They need to know that 
they, in fact, are in the driver’s seat. 
I thank everyone who has worked so 
diligently to make Be Pro Be Proud 
what it is today. The work they are 
doing will go on to leave a positive im-
pact on America’s future leaders for 
generations to come. 
AMERICANS ARE NOT CELEBRATING 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, it is no won-
der the American people believe that 
Washington is out of touch. Last week 
President Biden held an event on the 
White House lawn to celebrate the so- 
called Inflation Reduction Act. 
He took a victory lap in front of the 
entire country alongside his allies on 
live television. 
But, Mr. Speaker, do you know who 
was not celebrating with President 
Biden? 
Hardworking taxpayers and their 
families who are being pummeled by 
the President’s inflation catastrophe 
and inflation tax. That same day, new 
numbers were released showing that in-
flation continues to surge. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
President 
Biden 
couldn’t read a room if he tried. The 
rising cost of goods and services will 
cost the average American household 
over $700 a month. When added up, that 
is over $8,000 that they will be forced to 
fork out in a year. 
Grocery prices are up 13.5 percent, 
and food prices are up 11.4 percent 
since last year. This is the largest 1- 
year increase in prices since 1979. 
Mr. Speaker, anyone who believes 
that these numbers are worth cele-
brating needs a serious reality check. 
The Biden administration’s fiscal irre-
sponsibility put us in this mess. Come

NO ONE IS ABOVE OR BENEATH 
THE LAW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. 
Mr. Speaker, a monumental motif of 
American jurisprudence is the basic 
premise that no one is above the law. It 
doesn’t matter your station in life, it 
doesn’t matter whether you are the 
President of the United States, and it 
doesn’t matter how much money you 
have. No one is above the law. 
I would also remind us, Mr. Speaker, 
that there is a compelling corollary to 
this premise, and it is that no one is 
beneath the law. No one is above the 
law, yes, but no one is beneath the law. 
It doesn’t matter how poor you are. It 
doesn’t matter what kind of job you 
have. It doesn’t matter whether you 
are a janitor or you are a sanitation 
worker. It doesn’t matter. You are not 
beneath the law in this country. Even 
if you are an asylee coming here from 
another country, you are not beneath 
the law. 
b 1015 
I’m so proud, Mr. Speaker, to an-
nounce to my colleagues that the D.C. 
Council will vote on a migrant bill 
today. It seems that on Tuesday there 
will be an emergency bill to establish 
an Office of Migrant Services for the 
thousands who are being brought here 
by Governors of Texas and Florida. 
These persons in Washington, D.C., 
they are doing the righteous thing. 
They are trying to help lawful asylees 
as they traverse to their destiny. The 
Governors of Florida and Texas, they 
would have derailed the Underground 
Railroad. They would have been the 
persons who were out looking for those 
who were seeking freedom. 
I am proud of the Mayor of Wash-
ington, D.C. I don’t know how effica-
cious the program will be, but I do 
know that they are making an effort. 
For this effort, I not only commend 
them, I will do whatever I can to help 
them. It is time for us to realize that 
no one is beneath the law. Asylees are 
not beneath the law. They are law- 
abiding persons. The mere fact that 
they have submitted themselves and 
seek to have this opportunity to live in 
this country means that they have bro-
ken no law. 
I have a question for the Governors 
of Texas and Florida. Here is my ques-
tion: You are spending millions to 
bring people out of their way and to 
some extent put them in harm’s way. I 
have a question for you: How much will 
you spend to help them get to their 
hearings? How much will you spend to 
help them continue their journey? 
Yours is not a righteous cause. Yours 
is a cause to do what you can to pre-
vent lawful, law-abiding asylees from 
having their day in court. History will 
not be kind to you. You ought to be 
ashamed of what you do. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
f 
WE MUST NEVER BE ENEMIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, as 
the tensions of the Civil War reached a 
boiling point, President Lincoln vainly 
reached out to Democrats with these 
words: ‘‘We are not enemies, but 
friends. We must not be enemies.’’ 
The contrast with Mr. Biden’s Sep-
tember 1 speech in Philadelphia is jar-
ring. In it, and many remarks since, 
Mr. Biden clearly addresses the 74 mil-
lion Americans who voted for Donald 
Trump as enemies who ‘‘threaten the 
very foundation of our Republic.’’ He 
condemned us as ‘‘extremists’’ who ‘‘do 
not respect the Constitution,’’ and who 
‘‘do not believe in the rule of law’’ and 
who ‘‘refuse to accept the results of a 
free election.’’ In other forums, he has 
called us ‘‘semi-fascists.’’ 
Mr. President, we revere our Con-
stitution and the structure of indi-
vidual liberty that it was designed to 
protect. We do not understand how a 
government 
established 
under 
that 
Constitution could use the FBI to pres-
sure social media platforms to censor 
and suppress free speech or to intimi-
date parents concerned about their 
school boards with threat tags or to in-
struct its field offices to regard anyone 
who displays our founding American 
flag as a political extremist. 
Mr. President, we revere the rule of 
law and our Nation’s promise of equal 
justice under law. We do not under-
stand how our immigration laws can 
simply be ignored as millions of foreign 
nationals illegally enter our country. 
We do not understand how a dispute 
over records justifies an armed raid on 
a former President who is also a polit-
ical rival. 
We do not understand how public 
health officials can order our schools 
and businesses closed or suspend our 
fundamental rights to worship and as-
semble with no vote of the people’s 
Representatives. We do not understand 
how obvious influence peddling by the 
son of a President can be ignored for 
years. 
Mr. President, of course we accept 
the results of a free election, but we do 
not understand how the safeguards to 
protect the integrity of our elections 
can be torn down to benefit one party. 
Replacing in-person election day vot-
ing with mail-in ballots, ballot har-
vesting, month-long voting, accepting 
ballots after election day, printing bal-
lots on home computers—all of these 
changes undermine public confidence 
in the process that is essential to de-
mocracy. 
We wonder how you can call MAGA 
candidates a fundamental threat to our 
Republic while your party spends mil-
lions of dollars to nominate them when 
you believe it may help you in Novem-
ber. 
Mr. President, we can condemn all 
forms of violence and especially polit-
ical violence in the strongest possible 
terms. The riot at the Capitol on Janu-
ary 6 was a disgrace and an abomina-
tion that you are right to condemn, 
and we join you in doing so. 
But we don’t understand how you can 
at the same time turn a blind eye to 
prosecuting the political violence that 
burned our cities the year before or 
how you can refuse to enforce the laws 
that protect our Supreme Court Jus-
tices from intimidation at their own 
homes. 
Mr. President, we, too, fear for our 
democracy. We fear armed bureauc-
racies that seem increasingly discon-
nected from the results of our elec-
tions. We remember that the IRS sin-
gled out ordinary Americans because of 
their political views, yet no one was 
held accountable, and now we are add-
ing 87,000 new agents to that bureauc-
racy. 
We fear arbitrary changes in our 
election laws calculated to skew re-
sults. We fear an executive branch that 
is increasingly taking over the legisla-
tive powers of Congress and judicial 
powers of the courts. We fear the pow-
ers of government wielded by officials 
who view half of our people as dangers, 
threats, and extremists—your words, 
Mr. President. 
Lincoln spoke of the mystic chords of 
memory tracing back to the founding 
of our Nation that must hold us to-
gether as Americans. As friends and 
not enemies. Yet we see these chords 
increasingly strained by an alien ide-
ology that seems hostile to the flag, 
the principles, and the heritage of our 
Nation. 
We have only one President, Mr. 
President, and that is you. I didn’t vote 
for you, and I won’t vote for you again, 
but you are still my President. And the 
74 million Americans who voted for 
Donald Trump are still your fellow 
citizens. 
As the person most responsible for 
the policies we now live with and the 
future that is unfolding before us, I ask 
you to engage us as a friend and not an 
enemy. We must not be enemies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to address 
their remarks to the Chair and not to 
a perceived viewing audience.

September 20, 2022 
residents of Hemet were forced to evac-
uate their homes. 
Since then, the fire has burned over 
28,300 acres, caused two deaths, and de-
stroyed at least 36 homes or commer-
cial structures—proving to be one of 
the largest and most destructive fires 
our local communities have ever seen. 
To the families who have lost a loved 
one, our neighbors who have had to 
leave behind their homes, and the stu-
dents who had to miss school, know 
that my heart is with you, and I stand 
ready to support you in any way that I 
can. 
In the last 15 days we have faced 
much devastation. We have experi-
enced uncertainty, grief, and fear. We 
have seen the havoc wildfires can 
wreak on our families, environment, 
and livelihoods. We have also been 
moved by the resiliency of our commu-
nities. 
Through it all, I have been touched 
by the kindness and strength exhibited 
by every neighbor, firefighter, law en-
forcement officer, and volunteer who 
has pitched in to help keep us safe. 
To our first responders from: Hemet 
Fire Department; CAL FIRE Riverside; 
CAL FIRE Incident Management Team 
6; Riverside County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment; Cahuilla Fire; U.S. Forest Serv-
ice; Bureau of Land Management; 
Idyllwild Fire Department; and the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs, thank you for 
your immense heroism. 
It is because of each and every one of 
you—the men and women fighting the 
fire who have put your lives on the 
line—that the Fairview fire is now al-
most completely contained. There were 
856 responders and 22 crews from these 
departments who stepped up without 
hesitation. 
For their responsiveness and work to 
keep local families informed through-
out the Fairview fire, I especially want 
to acknowledge the Fairview Fire Uni-
fied Command: Hemet Fire Department 
Chief Eddie Sell; CAL FIRE Chief Josh 
Jansen; Riverside County Sheriff’s De-
partment Lieutenant John Shulda; and 
the U.S. Forest Service Chief Jim 
Snow. 
I also want to thank: CAL FIRE Inci-
dent Commander Deputy Chief Jeff 
Veik; CAL FIRE Incident Command 
Team 6 Staff Chief Andy Turner and 
Deputy Chief Dave Scheurich; River-
side County Fire Department Chief 
Dan Olson; Idyllwild Fire Department 
Chief Mark LaMont, and Cahuilla Fire 
Chief Randy Sandoval. 
At the fire’s highest point, nearly 
38,000 individuals were under threat 
and forced to evacuate. I am incredibly 
grateful to them for their leadership, 
as well as every volunteer who pitched 
in at evacuation cites from Hemet to 
Temecula. 
To everyone with the Riverside Coun-
ty Emergency Management Depart-
ment, Riverside Department of Animal 
Services, and the American Red Cross 
who has contributed to evacuation and 
prevention efforts, thank you for all 
that you have done. 
Your actions have helped families 
know when it was time to evacuate and 
helped our most at risk find shelter. In 
this disaster, there have been countless 
heroes, many who will go unnamed— 
the neighbor who texted their friend to 
make sure they saw the evacuation 
alert, the mother who pitched in that 
extra $10 to a local evacuation center, 
and the many non-profits, volunteers, 
and local leaders who did whatever 
they could to help without seeking 
honor or recognition. The list goes on 
and on. 
As a community, we can never forget 
the heroes who stepped up throughout 
the fire—big or small. As a Nation, I 
encourage each of us to follow the ex-
ample set by the people of Hemet to 
come together in a time of crisis and to 
always lend a helping hand to a neigh-
bor in need.

RECOGNIZING BRAD ASHFORD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the hard work and 
accomplishments of my friend and 
former Congressman, Brad Ashford, 
who passed away April 19, 2022. Brad 
began his career in politics by faith-
fully serving in the Nebraska State leg-
islature for 16 years, focusing on ways 
to solve problems in education, labor, 
and urban affairs. 
After being elected to represent the 
Second Congressional District of Ne-
braska, Brad worked hard to advance 
multiple bills in support of veterans. 
He was a co-sponsor of the Border Jobs 
for Veterans Act of 2015, which helped 
veterans find sustainable employment 
and apply their skills to work for Cus-
toms and Border Patrol. He also co- 
sponsored the Wounded Warriors Fed-
eral Leave Act of 2015, which allowed 
veterans with a service-related dis-
ability to take an increased amount of 
time to seek treatment and heal as 
needed. 
Brad will most be remembered when 
people drive by the nearly 2-year-old 
Ambulatory Care Clinic at Omaha’s VA 
Hospital. This facility, funded through 
a public-private partnership, was large-
ly the result of Brad’s efforts to craft 
and pass the CHIP In for Vets Act of 
2016. 
This innovative legislation was a 
first of its kind that enables the use of 
Federal funds to be matched with pri-
vately raised donations. Brad and I be-
came friends after 2016 and we worked 
together to see the project come to fru-
ition. This past September, I was hum-
bled to carry on his legacy by passing 
the reauthorization of this important 
legislation. 
It was Brad’s mission to ensure all 
constituents of the Nebraska commu-
nity felt well-represented. Throughout 
his tenure in Congress, Brad consist-
ently sought to reach across the aisle 
and advocate for bipartisan legislation, 
highlighting that Representatives are 
not only capable of working together, 
but must do so to advance our Nation, 
and we do this regardless of ideology or 
political party. 
He was a problem-solver and a man of 
action. Even after his time in Congress, 
he continued to advocate and educate 
the public on justice-engaged youth, 
including our last project together 
finding pathways to careers that could 
reintegrate them as productive mem-
bers of our community and reduce re-
cidivism. 
I salute and thank Brad for his lead-
ership, mentorship, and friendship. We 
went from being political adversaries 
to great friends. It is my hope that we 
all carry on Brad’s legacy of civility, 
compassion, and cooperation. I person-
ally will miss the optimistic and hope-
ful conversations with my friend that 
we frequently enjoyed. 
My heart goes out to his wife, Ann, 
his children; John, Ellie, and Tom; his 
granddaughter, Rosie; and his many 
loved ones. We are eternally grateful 
for all that Brad has done for our Na-
tion.

HONORING NEBRASKA SENATOR TOM BREWER 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, in honor of 
Native American Heritage Month, I 
rise to recognize the dedication and ac-
complishments of Senator Tom Brewer, 
a veteran with 37 years of service, in-
cluding six tours to Afghanistan, two 
Purple Hearts, and a Bronze Star. 
His experiences show resilience and 
true patriotism as he holds the title of 
the first senator of Native American 
descent to serve in Nebraska’s unicam-
eral. He was first elected in 2016 and 
represents the 13 counties of District 43 
in the western Nebraska Sandhills. 
Senator Tom Brewer is a member of 
the Oglala Lakota Sioux and grew up 
on the Pine Ridge Reservation before 
he enlisted in the Nebraska Army Na-
tional Guard. He attended college at 
Doane University in Crete on an ROTC 
scholarship and continued to serve us 
internationally as he fought on behalf 
of our freedoms in Afghanistan. 
Although gravely wounded in his 
final tour, Senator Brewer did not let 
this injury prevent him from fighting 
for his country through public service. 
After serving nearly four decades, Sen-
ator Brewer retired from the Army and 
was then elected to the Nebraska uni-
cameral. 
His inclusion represents how far we 
have come as a State, as well as the 
ways that we as people can come to-
gether in the future to uphold the prop-
osition that all men are created equal. 
Since his time in office, he has 
worked on legislation that improves 
veterans’ affairs and agriculture policy 
to help all Nebraskans. 
Senator Brewer continues to advo-
cate for farmers and ranchers, service-
men and women, and fights to protect 
our constitutional rights. He has just 
returned from 2 months in Ukraine 
doing 
humanitarian 
relief 
in 
the 
Kharkiv region.

Though he has faced much adversity, 
he has managed to overcome it and use 
his experiences to create new standards 
in Nebraska’s government. We thank 
him for his service and honor him for 
paving the way for all Native Ameri-
cans.

OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM 
THE VIRGIN ISLANDS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, first, I 
offer my prayers and the prayers of the 
people of the Virgin Islands for the peo-
ple of Puerto Rico after the devasta-
tion of Hurricane Fiona. My colleague 
across 
the 
aisle, 
Congresswoman 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, knows that, like so 
many other issues, she has my support. 
Mr. Speaker, like many Virgin Is-
landers, September is a month forever 
etched in my mind. Five years ago on 
September 6, Hurricane Irma relent-
lessly pummeled the territory, and Vir-
gin Islanders watched in mute shock as 
a Category 5 storm shredded roofs, up-
rooted trees, and shattered lives. 
Then, 2 weeks after Hurricane Irma, 5 
years ago today, Hurricane Maria made 
landfall. For hours that stretched into 
the early morning, another Category 5 
hurricane brought destruction across 
parts of the island that had not been 
shredded by Irma. 
The compounded impact of two Cat-
egory 5 hurricanes is unfathomable. 
Virgin Islanders, undeterred by the 
dramatic scale of devastation, rallied 
in the face of tragedy and proceeded to 
rebuild their lives and our community. 
Virgin Islanders banded together to 
deliver food and medical supplies, orga-
nize cleanup initiatives, and volunteer 
to transport people and goods between 
the multiple islands and Puerto Rico. 
The response of this body, the House 
of Representatives, from leadership 
chairs to rank-and-file Members, was 
extraordinary. Ultimately, the dia-
logues and relentless advocacy were 
crucial to securing extraordinary fund-
ing and a significant change to the 
Stafford Act for the Virgin Islands and 
Puerto Rico to not only provide nec-
essary funding to rebuild but to rebuild 
with resiliency, to rebuild not as 
things were but as things should have 
been. 
Despite the tremendous bipartisan 
funding, however, recovery stalled dur-
ing the Trump administration due to, 
frankly, a belief by that administra-
tion that the funding was too much for 
the people of the Virgin Islands and not 
the financial responsibility of the Fed-
eral Government. Money was slow- 
walked. 
Additionally, with the changes in law 
made by this Congress to allow the Vir-
gin Islands to rebuild to prevailing in-
dustry standards, HUD, and especially 
FEMA, have had difficulty at the re-
gional and local levels in accepting and 
implementing the changes in stand-
ards. 
In view of this and unnecessary gov-
ernment bureaucracy, I coauthored the 
Expediting Disaster Recovery Act, a bi-
partisan disaster relief bill, with my 
colleague 
Representative 
GARRET 
GRAVES, which expedites the allocation 
of additional funds and assistance to 
cover unmet needs. 
Our isolation from the mainland and 
relatively small size created difficulty 
in obtaining supplies and workers, and 
the decision to report in to Puerto Rico 
added another layer of bureaucracy, 
further hindering the speed of rebuild-
ing. 
I must be transparent by recognizing 
that, unfortunately, local government 
exacerbated the slow pace of the re-
build. The unprecedented funding was 
not met with sufficient macro plan-
ning. We did not use the first years 
after the storm and still have not suffi-
ciently built capacity—training indi-
viduals while paying them to meet con-
struction and project management de-
mands, developing integrated fund and 
project management systems, aggres-
sively recruiting experienced Virgin Is-
landers to return home to advance the 
rebuild, and educating the people to be 
prepared for spending the massive 
funding. 
Fortunately, there is a window of op-
portunity to jump-start this rebuild 
while Democrats remain in the major-
ity, our President prioritizes resiliency 
in underserved areas that are particu-
larly vulnerable to climate change, and 
our local and Federal elected officials 
maintain transparency and cooperation 
to advance this once-in-a-generation 
opportunity to transform the Virgin Is-
lands. 
I am continually encouraged by the 
grit and heroism exhibited by my peo-
ple, the people of the Virgin Islands, 
who face the grueling task of rebuild-
ing their lives with sheer tenacity and 
determination. 
Together, we have a shared responsi-
bility to safeguard the future of these 
islands by ensuring that the Virgin Is-
lands remain stronger and more resil-
ient from the twin tragedies of back- 
to-back Category 5 storms. The oppor-
tunity that lies before us is too great 
and meaningful to let pass by.

RECOGNIZING STATE SENATOR 
SHEILA MCNEILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in recognition of State 
Senator Sheila McNeill, who is retiring 
after many excellent years in service 
to the city of Brunswick and to the 
State of Georgia. 
Senator McNeill is a longtime sup-
porter of our country’s Armed Forces, 
having served for 2 years educating 
citizens and elected officials on the im-
portance of seapower as the first 
woman to ever lead the Navy League, 
but her support for America’s sailors 
didn’t stop there. 
In 1996, Senator McNeill played a key 
role in establishing St. Mary’s Sub-
marine Museum, the largest museum of 
its kind in the South. 
During her tenure as a State senator, 
Sheila sponsored legislation to fight 
Georgia’s human trafficking crisis and 
the pernicious effects of homelessness 
and sponsored countless bills to im-
prove our State’s educational infra-
structure. 
Sheila will be retiring at the end of 
her term this year to support her hus-
band of over six decades. We thank her 
for everything she has done for our 
Armed Forces, for students, and for the 
many Georgians she has served over 
the years. 
Her career has been a long and im-
pressive one, and we were so lucky to 
have such a talented woman fighting 
for such important causes. 
RECOGNIZING IAN GALLAGHER 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the brav-
ery of Ian Gallagher, a Rincon police 
officer who stepped up when help was 
needed most. 
On a bright morning this June, the 
city of Rincon was hosting their an-
nual Let Freedom Ring Parade, which I 
was proud to be a part of. A crowd of 
hundreds of people was gathered along 
either side of the parade route to watch 
the spectacle. 
Around this time, Officer Gallagher 
heard calls over the radio that the 
roadblock, which had been set up, had 
been breached by an erratically driving 
car. He looked and saw an SUV speed-
ing down the route, only just missing 
onlookers, including myself. 
Shouting to those along the road to 
back up to safety, knowing that he 
must do something to stop the driver, 
he kept his patrol car behind a fire 
truck. Just before the suspect’s car 
passed him, he pulled out directly into 
its path, stopping the driver in a head- 
on collision. His act of selfless bravery 
and split-second heroism undoubtedly 
saved many lives that day. 
While this head-on collision was dan-
gerous and surely jarring, both Officer 
Gallagher and his canine officer, who 
was with him at the time of the inci-
dent, are on their way to a full recov-
ery. 
He has recently been awarded the 
Medal of Valor, the Nation’s highest 
award of valor for a public safety offi-
cial. 
I, alongside the people of the First 
Congressional 
District 
of 
Georgia, 
thank him for his service and his self-
lessness. 
HONORING RON AND SANDRA ELLIOTT 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in honor of Ron and 
Sandra Elliott, owners of Game Chang-
ers Running Company. 
Since the store’s founding in 2012, 
Game Changers has been so much more 
than just a place to get your running 
shoes. Under the leadership of Ron and 
Sandra Elliott, Game Changers has 
been committed to the health and fit-
ness of Georgia’s coastal region.

As a physical therapist-owned estab-
lishment, Game Changers understands 
the importance of community health 
and wellness. They have heavily in-
vested in their community through 
various educational programs and run-
ning clinics, as well as financial con-
tributions to local charities. 
Since their doors first opened, Game 
Changers has been able to donate over 
$250,000 to local organizations to help 
transform coastal Georgia’s mindset 
about running and physical well-being. 
Ron and Sandra’s service to their 
community and their country began 
long before Game Changers opened its 
doors, having both served in the mili-
tary. 
Ron and Sandra, thank you for what 
you have done for our community 
through Game Changers. You have 
more than earned a relaxing and rest-
ful retirement. 
RECOGNIZING AND HONORING DON HOGAN 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor 
my good friend, Don Hogan, as he re-
tires from public service. 
Don graduated from Georgia South-
ern University and then attended the 
University of Georgia, graduating with 
a master’s degree in education. He 
committed himself to a career in the 
rehabilitation field, where he special-
ized in mental health, substance abuse, 
and developmental disabilities. 
In Brunswick and St. Simons, he has 
been known as a leader in civic in-
volvement 
and 
community 
service. 
During his 2-year term on the Glynn 
County Board of Commissioners, he 
served as both vice chairman and 
chairman. 
Most recently, he has served in the 
Georgia State House of Representa-
tives, representing the 179th District. 
Additionally, his philanthropic pas-
sions have impacted his community in 
ways that will be felt for years. He has 
served as area commissioner for Boy 
Scouts of America, as well as on the 
advisory council of the Coastal Area 
Planning and Development Commis-
sion, Goodwill Industries, and Glynn 
County School’s special instruction. 
The sacrifice that every public serv-
ant makes, alongside their family, is 
admirable and has no small impact on 
their life. I am very grateful for the in-
spirational leadership and servitude 
Don has displayed throughout his life. 
I, on behalf of the great people in the 
First Congressional District of Geor-
gia, take this moment to honor Rep-
resentative Don Hogan and his legacy.

CONSERVING ENERGY SAVES 
MONEY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, this 
month, Californians have faced one of 
the hottest and longest heat waves on 
record. 
From 
Sacramento 
to 
San 
Diego, families have suffered triple- 
digit temperatures. 
These extreme temperatures put an 
enormous strain on our electrical grid. 
It is urgent that Americans increase 
the energy efficiency of our homes. 
Fortunately, the Inflation Reduction 
Act makes this transition easier and 
cheaper. Thanks to this new law, which 
I helped pass, families can get new tax 
credits and rebates for installing en-
ergy-efficient products in their homes, 
including windows, water heaters, and 
heating and cooling systems. I recently 
welcomed Secretary of Energy Jennifer 
Granholm to visit an Orange County 
family saving money on utilities with 
efficient appliances. 
As the climate crisis continues to 
harm communities, the Inflation Re-
duction Act delivers relief. We can con-
serve energy and save families money 
at the same time. 
NURSING HOMES AREN’T COMMODITIES 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to champion protecting our sen-
iors. 
Wall Street shouldn’t get to decide if 
older Americans can age with dignity. 
But across the country, private equity 
firms are spending billions to turn 
nursing homes into commodities. 
When private equity firms take over 
nursing homes, they cut costs and cut 
corners; they lay off trusted staff; and 
they stretch care workers too thin to 
provide the care and attention older 
Americans need. Quality of care de-
clines, and deaths among residents rise 
dramatically. 
We cannot entrust our loved ones to 
these bad actors. They focus on maxi-
mizing returns for investors at the ex-
pense of delivering protected care to 
seniors, their patients. 
I have long pushed to hold private eq-
uity accountable and to end corporate 
abuse in healthcare. The health and 
well-being of our seniors are not for 
sale. 
CLIMATE CRISIS IS A HEALTH CRISIS 
Ms. PORTER. The climate crisis is a 
health crisis. 
This 
month, 
high 
temperatures 
threaten the well-being of Californians. 
For some, it was a matter of life and 
death. 
In the past decade alone, extreme 
heat has killed 3,900 Californians. We 
know who dies from extreme heat. 
b 1045 
Older Americans die in homes they 
can’t afford to keep cool. Workers die 
in the sun, doing jobs they can’t afford 
to lose. 
After years of ignoring the climate 
crisis, our Nation has finally directed 
resources to fighting climate change. 
Green investments in the Inflation Re-
duction Act will help older adults live 
longer and avoid heat-related health 
emergencies. They will protect our 
children from wildfire smoke that 
causes chronic breathing conditions. 
And by contributing to a healthier 
workforce, they will keep our economy 
strong. 
BROADBAND COMPETITION 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, the abil-
ity to shop for the best deal is funda-
mental to a free market economy. Yet, 
for years, many people in apartments 
and office buildings have been stuck 
with only one option for internet. 
Service 
providers 
have 
unfairly 
locked out competitors by securing ex-
clusivity agreements with landlords. 
Tenants are trapped into one choice for 
broadband, whether they are getting a 
fair deal or whether they are getting 
ripped off. 
Allowing 
big 
corporations 
to 
gatekeep the market is not healthy 
capitalism. I have previously pushed 
for the Federal Communications Com-
mission to crack down on abusive 
Internet 
Service 
Providers. 
I 
am 
pleased that the FCC unanimously 
adopted new rules this year to end 
these predatory agreements. 
Strengthening 
competition 
for 
broadband is proven to lower costs, im-
prove service, and promote innovation. 
Americans should have the freedom to 
choose the internet plan that is best 
for them. 
f 
CRISIS AT OUR SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to discuss the crisis at our south-
ern border and to call for this body to 
immediately take up the Border Secu-
rity Act of America that will restore 
order; that will enhance technology; 
and that will give our Customs and 
Border Protection agents the tools 
that they are begging for. 
A year ago last March, I actually 
went where the President and our Vice 
President refuse to go: to the southern 
border, Rio Grande. And if you talk to 
the CBP agents there, they will tell 
you exactly what is going on. 
We are seeing our southern border 
overrun by the drug cartels. We are 
seeing human trafficking take place. 
We are seeing and hearing from chil-
dren who are being abused along the 
journey, and the amount of fentanyl 
and other drugs that are streaming 
over our border and killing Americans 
is at record levels. It could be stopped 
today, but this administration and this 
Congress refuse to do it. 
The issue of public safety and na-
tional security is one we just discussed 
last week, September 11; we said we 
will never forget. But yet, here we have 
policies in place that make us less safe 
and could potentially cause something 
catastrophic to happen. 
We need to be wise. We need to be 
reasonable. We are a nation of immi-
grants. We are a compassionate nation. 
My mother is a Cuban refugee. My fa-
ther is a Greek immigrant. 
It is not about that. It is about hav-
ing order. It is about having laws. It is 
about having policies in place and 
making sure that they are being fol-
lowed. 
We know that 66 suspected terrorists 
were apprehended attempting to cross

our border. We also know that, at a 
time like this, we face threats from 
Russia and from China, and Iran 
straight out said that they plan at-
tacks on United States soil. 
And yet, with 3.2 million people 
crossing into our country illegally and 
500,000 gotaways from over 60 different 
countries, we run a risk of being in 
danger. Think about that, that is al-
most four times the population of the 
President’s home State of Delaware. 
Now it is also having a financial im-
pact on our constituents. It is now 
costing American taxpayers $20 billion 
a 
year, 
something 
completely 
unsustainable as U.S. debt approaches 
$31 trillion. 
Americans are struggling right now 
to get by. They are trying to keep roofs 
over their own heads. They are trying 
to pay their utility bills. They are try-
ing to put food on the table for their 
children, and now the majority wants 
them to pick up this additional cost for 
this unsustainable policy. 
My own mayor is saying that it is 
having an impact on New York City 
and that it is at a breaking point. He is 
complaining about the Governors who 
are busing individuals to New York 
City, but he hasn’t said a peep about 
the President who was flying them in 
over the last 2 years. 
The bottom line is, if my mayor or 
anyone else has an issue with what is 
happening in their cities, they need to 
hold the President accountable and 
this Congress accountable to make 
sure that we pass the laws that make 
sense. 
We need to bring up the Border Secu-
rity for America Act before we leave 
next week. If not, we are doing a great 
disservice to the people of this country. 
We are continuing to increase our debt. 
We are continuing to make our cities 
less safe, and we are continuing to put 
our Nation at risk in the future. 
f 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CA´ RDENAS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, today, 
I rise to honor the heritage, culture, 
and immense and amazing contribu-
tions of Latinos to the United States 
by introducing a bicameral resolution 
recognizing September 15 through Oc-
tober 15 as Hispanic Heritage Month. 
When you walk into my office, both 
in my Washington, D.C., office, and the 
San Fernando Valley office which I 
represent, you will notice a very im-
portant picture of two hard-working 
gentlemen, two generations of Mexican 
immigrants, my father and my moth-
er’s father, smiling while crouching 
down picking potatoes in the very hot 
Stockton, California, sun. 
No matter how exhausted, how busy, 
and how much pain they endured, they 
never complained, and they took the 
time to pause and smile because they 
were so proud to be able to do a hard 
day’s work and an honest day’s work 
right here in the United States of 
America. 
That same grit and positivity that 
they demonstrated in that photo are 
values carried by Latinos throughout 
our country’s history: farmworkers, as-
tronauts, scientists, and many amazing 
contributors to our great country. 
They are Latinos who have helped keep 
our country operating before the pan-
demic, through the pandemic, and still 
to this day. It is those same values and 
stories, those of individuals, many of 
them immigrants, who encompass an 
unwavering 
spirit 
of 
perseverance. 
These are the true stories that will be 
told at the National Museum of the 
American Latino. 
Latinos have been in what is now the 
United States for hundreds of years. So 
current and future generations have 
the opportunity to visit the National 
Mall and experience our beautiful his-
tory, culture, and contributions that 
make us the greatest Nation in the 
world. 
Yes, that is right, Mr. Speaker. The 
beautiful National Mall will soon have 
a Latino museum on it so that people 
from all over the world can appreciate 
the 
amazing 
contributions 
that 
Latinos have been making to this great 
country and this continent for hun-
dreds and hundreds of years. 
I urge my colleagues in the House to 
join me in recognizing these amazing 
contributions of Latinos of the United 
States, and to encourage everyone to 
recognize that we are a great country. 
We are an eclectic country, and we do 
have much to be proud of. We, as Amer-
icans from every part of this world, 
have made this country their home. 
To people who are Latinos, it is sad 
to hear just a few minutes ago that 
even Members of Congress will say de-
rogatory things about the southern 
border and make people believe that 
you should be afraid of immigrants 
who come to this country, who seek a 
better life, people who come to this 
country and do the jobs that most 
Americans, including me, really don’t 
want to do but need to be done. 
If you are a senior in the United 
States of America, it is very likely, as 
you get older and you need somebody 
to help you in your day-to-day life, it 
will probably be somebody with an ac-
cent. And yes, I smile when I say that; 
somebody who gives their love and 
commitment to that person who de-
serves the dignity of being cared for. 
Many, many times, it is an immigrant. 
Many, many times, they speak Span-
ish. ‘‘Of course, they speak Spanish.’’ 
‘‘Seguro que si, hablan espanol.’’ Like 
my grandfather who came to this coun-
try, my mother who came to this coun-
try, and my father who came to this 
country did. 
My grandfather had no formal edu-
cation; my mother and father only had 
a first and second grade education. 
Why did they come to the United 
States? 
Because they knew that this was a 
country of opportunity. 
And although they suffered many in-
dignities of racism and derogatory 
comments toward them or what have 
you, they raised 11 American-born citi-
zens in what some people would call a 
very tough neighborhood. I say a very 
beautiful, 
challenged 
neighborhood, 
but a beautiful neighborhood at that. 
And now I, as their youngest son, get 
to be a United States Congressman, to 
contribute to this country as a U.S. 
citizen and a Representative of the 
community that I was born and raised 
in; yet, at the same time, to advance 
what is good about our country and to 
be an example to every single one of us. 
We live in a great country, the 
United States of America, and Latinos 
have always made contributions.

BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE 
LEGISLATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, as a 50- 
year member of the Massachusetts 
Building Trades, as former president of 
the Ironworkers Local 7 in Boston, and 
as a proud member of the Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure 
here in Congress, I rise in support of 
and in acknowledgement of the success 
and benefits to our States, cities, and 
towns, of President Biden’s trans-
formational Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act, better known as the bi-
partisan infrastructure law. 
Signed by President Biden this past 
November, this landmark legislation 
continues to provide critical invest-
ments in our Nation’s infrastructure 
and transportation systems, including 
$550 billion in new funding to repair 
and 
modernize 
America’s 
roads, 
bridges, public transit systems, pas-
senger and freight rail ports, airports, 
high-speed internet, and water sys-
tems. 
Importantly, the bipartisan infra-
structure law also stands as a testa-
ment to what we can accomplish to-
gether on behalf of the American peo-
ple when we set aside partisanship and 
divisiveness in favor of collaboration 
toward addressing the most urgent 
needs of the American people. 
In my own State of Massachusetts, 
the Eighth Congressional District that 
I represent, we are already putting his-
toric Federal funding delivered by the 
bipartisan infrastructure law into use. 
We have older infrastructure in Mas-
sachusetts, especially the city of Bos-
ton, the city of Brockton, and the city 
of Quincy. Over $8.5 billion will be allo-
cated to Massachusetts to support that 
infrastructure, to rebuild it over the 
next 5 years. 
In fact, this year alone, $2 billion in 
new Federal funding has been an-
nounced for our State to date, includ-
ing more than $1.7 billion identified for

key transportation and infrastructure 
projects. 
Considering that 472 of our State 
bridges and more than 1,100 miles of 
Massachusetts highway has been de-
clared deficient or in poor condition, 
this funding will not only be used for 
structural repairs, but also will serve 
to reinforce our coastal infrastructure 
against the devastating impacts of cli-
mate change. 
Our State has already received near-
ly $190 million in bipartisan infrastruc-
ture law funding this year to support 
lead pipe replacement and other clean 
and safe water improvements. This 
funding will be critical to some of our 
older historic cities, like the city of 
Brockton, that struggle with toxic 
chemicals in their water supply. 
b 1100 
As it does in all 50 States, the bipar-
tisan infrastructure law has already al-
located approximately $534 million this 
year for Massachusetts to improve our 
public transportation systems. This 
funding could not be timelier for the 
residents of Massachusetts in view of 
the ongoing safety incidents, operating 
deficiencies, personnel shortages, and 
service reductions at the MBTA, one of 
the oldest transit systems in the coun-
try. 
Earlier this year, we also broke 
ground at a new electric bus mainte-
nance facility in Quincy, Massachu-
setts, that will serve to accommodate a 
modern electric fleet of MBTA buses 
and alleviate the carbon footprint of 
our public transportation that exacer-
bates the incidence of asthma and res-
piratory disease. 
Just this month, our State delega-
tion joined President Biden at Boston 
Logan Airport to recognize the $62 mil-
lion in bipartisan infrastructure law 
funding that will be used to modernize 
and increase the climate resilience of 
our international terminal and its sur-
rounding roadways. That project is ex-
pected to create almost 6,000 jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan infra-
structure law is supporting similar 
projects and job creation across this 
great country to the enormous benefit 
of the American people. It is also, I re-
mind my colleagues, a worthwhile ex-
ample of what Democrats and Repub-
licans can do here in Congress when we 
work together. 
f 
CELEBRATING RECOVERY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, every 
September, 
we 
observe 
Recovery 
Month to celebrate the millions of 
Americans in recovery from substance 
use disorders, and we reaffirm our com-
mitment to passing policies to combat 
the impact of addiction in our commu-
nities. 
The impact of addiction is tragically 
far reaching, extending far beyond the 
individual suffering, impacting entire 
families, especially children. 
The opioid epidemic has forced in-
creasing numbers of kinship caregivers, 
most of whom are grandparents, to 
take over the role of primary care-
givers for children impacted by the cri-
sis. Grandparents like Susan, a grand-
mother I spoke with recently at an 
opioid awareness vigil, who had stepped 
up to be her grandchildren’s primary 
caregiver but is struggling to make 
ends meet, unable to access services 
that would be available if her grand-
children were instead placed in foster 
care. 
I introduced the Help Grandfamilies 
Prevent Child Abuse Act to help ensure 
that grandfamilies like Susan’s have 
access to the critical services and sup-
port needed to keep kids safe and keep 
them with their own families. 
Combating addiction will take all of 
us working together to support our 
loved ones and community members. 
We can’t let our families fight this 
fight alone. 
SUPPORTING AND DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, as I 
walked up the Capitol steps this morn-
ing, I was stopped by a reporter who 
wanted to know if it was a priority of 
the Democratic Party to pass the Pres-
idential Election Reform Act, which we 
will consider in the House this week. I 
was stunned by the assumption in that 
question that protecting the peaceful 
transfer of power in the United States 
of America could ever be a partisan 
issue. In fact, the legislation under 
consideration is a bipartisan bill. 
I don’t care if you are a Democrat, a 
Republican, a conservative, a liberal, 
an Independent, if you love this coun-
try and believe in a government by the 
people, for the people, of the people, we 
all have an obligation to confront the 
dangers posed by radical extremists 
who would undermine our elections, 
abandon the peaceful transfer of power 
and the rule of law for their own per-
sonal or political gain. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues of all political stripes to 
strengthen the guardrails of our de-
mocracy and to support and defend our 
Constitution. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CELEBRATE 
COMMUNITY WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Celebrate Community Week. 
Last week, Congressman JIMMY PA-
NETTA from California and I introduced 
a resolution to designate the week of 
September 11 through September 17 as 
Celebrate Community Week and com-
memorate the efforts of local service 
organizations across the country. 
Mr. PANETTA and I are co-chairs of 
the bipartisan Congressional Service 
Organization Caucus. The resolution 
recognizes the role of service organiza-
tions in promoting community human-
itarian assistance while also instilling 
the value of giving back in our youth. 
We specifically applauded the Kiwanis 
International, 
Lions 
Clubs 
Inter-
national, Optimist International, and 
Rotary International for encouraging 
and promoting community service and 
humanitarian assistance through their 
local chapters. 
The Celebrate Community Week res-
olution highlights the critical work of 
our community service organizations. 
Volunteer service is the cornerstone of 
a successful, strong, and healthy com-
munity, and is an important staple of 
American life. 
I commend our community service 
organizations 
like 
the 
Lions 
Club 
International, 
Rotary 
International, 
Kiwanis International, and Optimist 
International for everything they do to 
help our communities flourish. 
CELEBRATING CONSTITUTION DAY 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today because over 
the weekend, we celebrated Constitu-
tion Day. On September 17, we com-
memorate the signing and adoption of 
the U.S. Constitution in 1787 in Phila-
delphia, Pennsylvania. 
This day, where we celebrate our 
Constitution, originated in 1953 when 
the Senate passed a resolution desig-
nating September 17 to 23 as Constitu-
tion Week. 
In 2004, Congress officially made Con-
stitution Day and Citizenship Day a 
Federal holiday. Congress also required 
all 
publicly 
funded 
agencies 
and 
schools to provide information on the 
Constitution on this day. 
In 2017, President Trump proclaimed 
September 17 as Constitution Day and 
Citizenship 
Day. 
Constitution 
Day 
serves as a celebration of our American 
system as well as a reminder that our 
government exists to serve the people 
and their freedom. 
For 235 years, Congress has been 
given the responsibility by the people 
to represent their interests. We should 
behave like every day is Constitution 
Day and remember Congress should al-
ways serve the people as outlined in 
the preamble. 
POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
September 16 as POW/MIA Recognition 
Day. 
Last Friday, we remembered the men 
and women our Armed Forces who 
served honorably and have not re-
turned home. 
At this time, almost 82,000 service-
men and -women have not returned 
home from the battlefield. This in-
cludes those who served in World War 
II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, 
the Cold War, and both wars in Iraq. 
Those who serve in uniform have sac-
rificed greatly to give us the oppor-
tunity to live our lives in freedom and 
in peace. We thank those who served 
and returned home, but most impor-
tantly we remember those who served 
and never returned.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7977 
September 20, 2022 
Last May, I introduced the Prisoners 
of War and Missing in Action Trade 
Agreement Resolution. This resolution 
would urge our mutually beneficial 
trade agreements to include a commit-
ment from our trade partners to con-
tinue to search for and recover our 
missing servicemembers. 
Mr. Speaker, on this POW/MIA Rec-
ognition Day, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution and honor our 
commitment to bring our servicemen 
and -women home. 
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, Sunday marked the 21st 
anniversary of the September 11 terror 
attacks. I rise today to remember the 
innocent lives we lost. 
At 
8:46 
a.m., 
American 
Airlines 
Flight 11 flew into Tower 1 of the 
World Trade Center. Not long after, 
Flight 175 roared over Lower Manhat-
tan into Tower 2. 
While Americans around the country 
were grappling with the events that 
just transpired, a third plane, Flight 
77, crashed into the Pentagon. 
In 
southwest 
Pennsylvania, 
the 
fourth flight, United 93, was hijacked 
and made the abrupt turn toward 
Washington, D.C. But because of the 
brave passengers and crew members, it 
crashed into a field in Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania. 
In the days, weeks, months, and now 
more than two decades that followed 
September 11, our country joined to-
gether to face the very evil which at-
tempted to take us down. 
We will forever be indebted to our 
servicemen and -women who joined the 
fight to protect our freedoms. 
While today’s world has grown no 
less dangerous, we, as Americans, are 
resilient. We will never forget, not 21 
years later, not ever. 
May God continue to watch over our 
first responders, our men and women in 
uniform, and all those who keep us 
safe.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God our Savior, break into our world 
which is rife with bad news, and make 
known the redeeming proclamation of 
Your love for us and Your plans for our 
good and not our harm. 
Preserve the welfare of countries and 
communities around the world from 
the disasters threatening them. Par-
ticularly on this day, we pray for the 
people of Puerto Rico and the Carib-
bean as once again they battle the dev-
astation inflicted on them by damaging 
winds and raging seas. 
Grant us redemption from all that 
seeks to distance us from Your love 
and distract us from faith in You. Re-
store our relationship with You that by 
Your mercy, we would all be welcomed 
once again into Your embrace. 
Lord, You are the ruler of the uni-
verse. We appeal to You this day that 
Your saving hand would hold and pro-
tect Your people. 
Renewed in Your name, we pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN) come for-

Mr. ALLEN led the Pledge of Alle-

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

MIGRANTS WHO SEEK ASYLUM 
AND REFUGE IN AMERICA 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, last 
week, nearly 50 migrants who sought 
asylum and refuge in America were 
met with grossly un-American actions. 
Governor DeSantis deceived them 
and shipped them across the Nation, 
like chattel, to Martha’s Vineyard all 
in search of hollow political points. 
Not only was this a failed political 
stunt, it was a failure of common hu-
manity—of common decency. 
To think of what men, women, chil-
dren—a 1-month-old—endured to seek 
asylum in our great Nation. To think 
of the bravery and the agony to leave 
your home, your family, your country 
in search of a better way of life—flee-
ing communism, political and eco-
nomic instability in Venezuela. 
Madam Speaker, Members come to 
this floor to give 1-minute speeches 
every session, and I hear Republican 
speeches and I see the signs, the 
stunts—Biden’s border crisis. 
No. This is America’s problem, our 
problem. And a ‘‘wall’’ or these recent, 
cruel stunts by shameful Governors au-
ditioning to be the next Trump offer no 
solutions, no hope. 
Instead, it will take courage—cour-
age by Republicans in both Chambers 
to come back to the table and work 
with Democrats to fix our long-broken 
immigration system. That is the Amer-
ican way. 
f 
EMPLOYEE RIGHTS 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, we 
should empower our workforce to flour-
ish. However, Washington Democrats 
are fixated on dragging us back to an 
outdated model via their PRO Act, 
which would strip workers of their 
freedoms and force every American 
worker to either join a union or pay 
dues to a union in order to keep their 
jobs. This is not the American way. 
Freedom of choice is what makes our 
economy strong, and every American 
should have that choice. Our workforce 
is constantly evolving, and we need 
creative, forward-thinking legislation 
that 
gives 
workers 
and 
small 
businessowners 
both 
stability 
and 
flexibility. That is why Senator TIM 
SCOTT and I introduced the Employee 
Rights Act. 
Our bill protects independent con-
tractors, entrepreneurs, gig workers, 
franchisees, and anyone else seeking to 
earn a living on their own terms. The 
Employee Rights Act puts workers in 
the driver’s seat by giving them the 
protections they need to choose for 
themselves how to earn a living and 
build a future for their families. 
Republicans stand with the 21st cen-
tury worker. It is time our labor laws 
did the same. 
f 
HAWAIIAN HISTORY MONTH 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to continue to honor September 
as Hawaiian History Month in my 
home State of Hawaii. Today, I am 
honoring 
Prince 
Jonah 
Kuhio 
Kalaniana’ole. Prince Kuhio was the 
second Native Hawaiian to represent 
Hawaii in Congress, when he was elect-
ed in 1903, and he served for two dec-
ades until his death in 1922. 
He is best known for the establish-
ment of the Hawaiian Civic Club of 
Honolulu in 1918 and the passage of the 
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act in 
1920. Throughout his life, Prince Kuhio, 
revered by Native Hawaiians as Ke 
Ali’i Maka’ainana, a prince for the peo-
ple, was a tenacious leader and used his

voice to preserve and strengthen the 
Hawaiian people. 
Prince Kuhio championed the Hawai-
ian Homes Commission Act, which was 
signed into law by President Warren G. 
Harding in 1921. The Act enables Native 
Hawaiians to return to their lands in 
order to support self-sufficiency and 
self-determination. This Act created a 
homeland 
to 
build 
homes, 
farms, 
ranches, and otherwise engage in eco-
nomic activities. 
This legacy of championing Native 
Hawaiian causes and preserving Native 
Hawaiian history is what Prince Kuhio 
is most remembered for, and I am 
proud to continue that legacy here in 
the United States House of Representa-
tives. 
f 
BIDEN ELECTRICITY COST SURGE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, American families are 
paying the highest electricity prices in 
over 40 years with a 16 percent increase 
from a year ago. Additionally, natural 
gas prices to heat homes are up 30 per-
cent as winter nears due to the extrem-
ist Biden energy failing policies. 
According to a HelpAdvisor survey in 
the last year, a quarter of Americans 
reduced food and medicine so they 
could pay the energy bill. Unfortu-
nately, one in six people, more than 20 
million households, are behind on util-
ity bills and in danger of losing utility 
services. The Energy Information Ad-
ministration anticipates an additional 
increase this year. 
The policies of Biden and Democrats 
are responsible for high utility costs 
and destroying jobs. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from a safe haven in 
Afghanistan to America. With the open 
Biden border for terrorists, American 
families today are at a greater risk of 
mass murder than ever before.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BATTA 
VUCIJIC 
(Mr. GARCIA of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to take a mo-
ment to honor the life of my dear 
friend, Batta Vucijic. 
Batta was a leader in our community 
whose contributions to North LA Coun-
ty will live on for several generations. 
As a founding board member at the 
Ministry of Life Without Limbs, he 
spread the good word of our savior 
Jesus Christ to many, including those 
in prison ministries. 
Batta is served by the love of his life, 
Rita; their seven children, Marco, Nat-
alie, 
Elena, 
Lara, 
Daniela, 
Dario, 
Ariana, and Nataliya, who he loved as 
his own; their spouses; and dozens more 
family members. 
I will always remember Batta’s com-
mitment to our community and his 
friendship. We will miss him dearly. 
Today, he sits next to the one true 
king in heaven and looks down upon us 
all with pride with his warm, humble 
demeanor. 
Batta was a dear friend, a great 
American, and a true believer. We love 
you and miss you, my friend. God 
blessed us with Batta’s presence and 
now has brought him home. 
f 
NATIONAL RICE MONTH 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, Sep-
tember is National Rice Month, and 
even though the month is two-thirds 
over with, it is never not time to have 
rice for your next meal. 
I want to pay a special tribute to the 
hardworking farmers, millers, mer-
chants, suppliers, and the consumers 
who make rice not only such a nutri-
tious product, but an important part of 
our economy. 
My home State of California is the 
second largest rice-producing State 
with the Sacramento Valley home to 95 
percent of California’s production. It is 
an important part also of the Pacific 
Flyway. California primarily produces 
medium grain sticky rice, otherwise 
known as sushi rice. 
America’s rice industry contributes 
125,000 good-paying jobs and an esti-
mated $34 billion to our Nation’s econ-
omy. Rice farmers take excellent care 
of their land, prioritizing resource con-
servation, nutrition, top yields world-
wide, and product quality. 
U.S. rice farmers produce more rice 
using less land, energy, and water than 
they did just 20 years ago, providing 
critical 
habitat 
for 
many 
species, 
which is really important, once again, 
to the Pacific Flyway as the ducks and 
geese move all the way from the north 
down to the south. 
Unfortunately, drastic water cuts 
have taken half of the rice acreage out 
of California this year. We need to keep 
the industry going strong for all those 
good needs.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
the Rules Committee met and reported 
a rule, House Resolution 1361, pro-
viding for consideration of S. 1098, the 
Joint Consolidation Loan Separation 
Act, under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member on 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor, as well as one motion to com-
mit. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader, or his designee, the ability 
to en bloc requested roll call votes on 
suspension bills considered on Sep-
tember 19 to September 22. This au-
thority lasts through September 22, 
2022. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased we are 
here today to provide consideration of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7979 
September 20, 2022 
the Joint Consolidation Loan Separa-
tion Act, led by my colleagues Senator 
MARK WARNER of Virginia and Rep-
resentative DAVID PRICE of North Caro-
lina. 
From 1993 to 2006, the Department of 
Education allowed married couples to 
consolidate their student loans for a 
lower interest rate through the Joint 
Consolidation Loan program requiring 
participating borrowers to be jointly 
liable for repayment of their loans. 
Congress ended the program in 2006, 
but Congress never provided a way for 
borrowers to disentangle the joint 
debt. Across the country, there are bor-
rowers who remain liable for their 
former spouse’s debt, even in cases of 
domestic violence. 
b 1215 
Today, we have an opportunity to ad-
dress this problem and help borrowers 
regain their financial independence. 
The Joint Consolidation Loan Sepa-
ration Act allows borrowers to apply to 
the Department of Education to split 
their consolidated loan into two sepa-
rate Federal direct loans. Borrowers 
can submit either a joint application or 
an individual application in the case of 
domestic violence, economic abuse, or 
inability to reach a former spouse. 
The joint consolidation loan remain-
der would be split proportionally based 
on the percentages that each borrower 
originally brought into the loan. The 
two new Federal direct loans would 
have the same interest rates as the 
joint consolidation loan. 
Additionally, the bill would enable 
borrowers to regain access to student 
loan relief programs such as the public 
service loan forgiveness program and 
income-driven repayment programs for 
which they were previously ineligible 
due to their joint consolidation loans. 
Like many of my colleagues, I have 
heard from constituents who have joint 
consolidated loans with their former 
spouses. Some of those constituents ex-
press frustration that, due to having a 
joint loan, they become ineligible to 
apply for other student loan relief pro-
grams, even though they are no longer 
with their spouse and they are carrying 
the burden of the joint loan. 
Constituents also entrusted me with 
their 
personal 
stories 
of 
domestic 
abuse and how these joint consolidated 
loans won’t allow them to get away 
from their abusive former spouses. 
Just a few weeks ago, a constituent 
from Wheat Ridge, Colorado, reached 
out to my office. It has been nearly 17 
years since her separation from her 
abusive spouse. Following her divorce, 
not only did she and her family con-
tinue to receive harassment from this 
individual, but she was left with the fi-
nancial burden of paying the entire 
loan balance because her former spouse 
refused to pay his share. 
All she wanted was a fresh start, so 
she moved to Colorado, but her joint 
consolidated loan with her former 
spouse continues to loom over her. 
She is not asking for her loans to be 
forgiven. She is simply asking to be fi-
nally freed from this abusive relation-
ship by passing this Joint Consolida-
tion Loan Separation Act. 
I thank her and all the other individ-
uals who have come forward to share 
how this loan program that ended near-
ly two decades ago continues to affect 
their daily lives. 
I commend Representative PRICE, 
Senator WARNER, and all of my col-
leagues for this work on this bill. I 
urge all my colleagues to support the 
rule and the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Representative from Colo-
rado for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
S. 1098 is intended to ensure bor-
rowers who need to separate their 
loans urgently because they are vic-
tims of domestic or economic abuse are 
not put in further harmful financial 
situations due to having a joint con-
solidation loan that cannot be sepa-
rated. 
Republicans fully support the inten-
tion of the bill, and it is something we 
should be able to address in a fully bi-
partisan manner. However, they are 
concerned that this bill misses the 
mark. 
According to the Department of Edu-
cation, this bill could not be imple-
mented for at least a year or longer. If 
we want to truly solve this problem, 
victims need help immediately. 
This bill also broadens the Secretary 
of Education’s authority. It gives the 
Secretary the authority to allow for 
new consolidation loans if it is in the 
fiscal interest of the Federal Govern-
ment but does not define the term. 
In addition, this bill did not receive a 
hearing in the House Education and 
Labor Committee, no discussion, no 
input, simply accepting the Senate’s 
version, which was introduced before 
the President’s announcement of stu-
dent loan forgiveness. 
My Republican colleagues on the 
Education and Labor Committee have 
an alternative bill that will protect 
victims of abuse, allowing borrowers to 
separate their loans immediately rath-
er than waiting up to 18 months. 
It also protects taxpayers from po-
tential abuse of authority by the Sec-
retary of Education by narrowly tai-
loring the authority to help those in 
need. Congress should always be con-
cerned about relinquishing authority 
to the executive branch. 
This bill also closes all the gaps that 
exist in the bill that has been brought 
up on the floor today. Yet, my col-
leagues were ignored, and now we are 
left discussing an incomplete policy. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this alternative that 
would solve the problems without 
ceding more authority to the Sec-
retary. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule, 
and I ask the Members to do the same. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, first, I include in 
the RECORD a Statement of Adminis-
tration Policy, dated September 19, 
2022, supporting this particular piece of 
legislation. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
S. 1098—JOINT CONSOLIDATION LOAN SEPARATION 
ACT—SEN. WARNER, D–VA, AND 3 COSPONSORS 
The Administration supports House pas-
sage of S. 1098, the Joint Consolidation Loan 
Separation Act. The bill would build on ac-
tions the Administration has taken to sup-
port federal student loan borrowers. 
While the authority to originate joint con-
solidation loans ended in 2006, borrowers 
with these loans were given no way to dis-
entangle their debts, even in the event of di-
vorce, economic abuse, or unresponsiveness 
from a former spouse. S. 1098 would allow 
two borrowers with a joint consolidation 
loan to jointly submit an application to the 
Department of Education to separate their 
consolidated loan into two separate loans. 
The loans would be split proportionately 
based on the original loan amounts. This bill 
would also allow survivors of domestic vio-
lence or economic abuse or borrowers who 
are unable to reach the other borrower to 
submit an individual application to separate 
their portion of the joint consolidation loan. 
The Administration urges the House to 
pass S. 1098, the Joint Consolidation Loan 
Separation Act, and send it to the President, 
to fix one part of the student loan program 
and provide this critical support to bor-
rowers with joint consolidation loans. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I listened to my friend from Minnesota, 
and I appreciate her remarks. The 
amendment that has been discussed 
that the Republicans are proposing 
simply does not go far enough. 
This bill really should be embraced 
unanimously in this House, just as it 
was in the Senate between Democrats 
and Republicans, allowing for spouses 
to separate, take on their own specific 
piece of the loan, and move forward, no 
longer staying in this kind of locked-in 
relationship, especially in those situa-
tions. 
They do recognize the abusive rela-
tionships, but there are also some 
where there is economic abuse or where 
you simply can’t reach the spouse. In 
those instances, too, there should be 
the ability to divide these back into 
their original forms. 
So, this bill, like it was in the Sen-
ate, should be accepted, I think, uni-
versally by this House. I am sorry to 
see that there is opposition. It doesn’t 
make a lot of sense to me. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
point out that the vote that my col-
league does point out regarding this 
bill in the Senate was before the Presi-
dent made his announcement regarding 
student loan forgiveness. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROD-
NEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, all I have to say on 
this rule is to listen to whatever she 
said, nothing of what my colleague 
from the State of Colorado says.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7980 
September 20, 2022 
I am actually here because my good 
friend, Mrs. FISCHBACH, is allowing me 
to correct a mistake. I missed the 1- 
minute time period, so I am going to 
use my time to actually honor one of 
my constituents. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to rec-
ognize Dr. Thomas Ramage, the fifth 
president of Parkland College since its 
1966 inception, who will retire at the 
end of this year following a remarkable 
15 years as president and 24 years of 
service to the institution. 
Under the leadership of Dr. Ramage, 
Parkland College completed a $92 mil-
lion campus master plan that created 
six new buildings, adding 250,000 square 
feet of classrooms, labs, and student 
service spaces to provide the quality 
educational facilities that our students 
need. 
During his time at Parkland, Tom 
has continued to adapt to the changing 
needs of industry, acquiring the Insti-
tute of Aviation at Willard Airport 
from the University of Illinois and 
forming lasting relationships with pri-
vate-sector partners. 
Under his guidance, Parkland also 
leads the Illinois community college 
system by enrolling more than 350 
international 
students, 
representing 
well over 50 countries. 
Dr. Ramage’s strong fiscal manage-
ment and guidance led Parkland Col-
lege through a recession, a State budg-
et crisis, and a pandemic. The legacy of 
excellence that he leaves behind is 
even stronger than when he became 
president in 2007. 
I have had the pleasure of working 
with Tom throughout my decade in 
Congress. I am proud to call him my 
friend, and I congratulate him on his 
well-earned retirement. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
ordinarily, I would argue with my 
friend from Illinois, but since it was 
such a nice testimonial to the doctor, I 
will support him in his 1 minute and 
his nice comments as his friend retires. 
Getting back to the matter at hand, 
Madam Speaker, we are here to deal 
with loan separation. I would say that 
we are looking at some 14,000 loans to 
which this might be applicable. 
It will provide a path forward for bor-
rowers with these loans who no longer 
want their debt to be tied to their 
former spouse. It is particularly impor-
tant for borrowers who just want to 
meet their own debt obligation without 
being saddled with someone else’s. 
We have heard from these constitu-
ents, as we heard from my constituent 
from Wheat Ridge, Colorado, about the 
fact that she has been divorced for 17 
years and is still saddled with a debt 
that her husband owed and won’t take 
responsibility for. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule allowing for the im-
mediate consideration of H.R. 8749 to 
repeal the methane emissions and 
waste reduction incentive program for 
petroleum and natural gas systems. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD along with 
the extraneous materials immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
just last week, a constituent called my 
office with concerns about the Presi-
dent’s energy policy. Joshua hauls gas 
for a living and said it is the best job 
he has ever had, but he worries that 
President Biden wants to take that 
away. He asked for my support and ex-
pressed his appreciation for anything 
that I can do to protect the industry. 
H.R. 8749 is a key piece of that puzzle. 
It supports American energy independ-
ence and all those who rely on it by 
protecting the Permian Basin and the 
largest secure supply of crude oil in the 
world. 
If the Biden administration gets 
their way on this issue, production will 
be slowed in that region, jobs will be 
lost, and gas prices will continue to 
rise. 
Madam Speaker, this Presidential 
administration 
is 
actively 
working 
against the oil and gas industry. They 
have increased natural gas production 
taxes, prevented energy development 
in Alaska, and made permitting more 
difficult. 
They are prioritizing supplemental 
energy technologies like wind and 
solar, but the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration’s annual energy out-
look projected that petroleum and nat-
ural gas will be the most used fuels in 
the U.S. through 2050. We cannot aban-
don these reliable and essential sources 
of energy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
PFLUGER), the author of the bill, to fur-
ther explain the amendment. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Minnesota 
for so eloquently explaining the under-
lying reason that I rise to oppose the 
previous question so that we may im-
mediately consider H.R. 8749, which is 
my bill to strike the new tax on every 
American, the new tax on natural gas 
that was included in the Democrats’ 
paycheck reduction act. 
At a time when we actually are wit-
nessing probably the most destructive 
energy poverty crisis in the civilized 
world, which is happening right now in 
Europe, in most cases happening in 
countries that are now experiencing a 
tenfold increase of their heating bills, 
a tenfold increase of their energy bills, 
a tenfold increase of all the require-
ments of energy, the most foundational 
piece of any economy, President Biden 
is driving an agenda to do the same 
thing here in the United States, driv-
ing an agenda to impoverish the energy 
needs of this country. 
While the President may deny the ex-
istence of inflation and crippling price 
hikes, those of us who are actually 
buying our own groceries and paying 
our bills every month know that is 
false. No position in the United States 
can deny the economic facts—8.3 per-
cent. That, I believe, pales in compari-
son to what areas in rural America are 
actually paying. 
Price hikes on energy are the largest 
driver of this inflation by far. Gas util-
ity bills are up 33 percent. Electricity 
is up almost 16 percent. It is 16 percent 
more expensive than it was this time 
last year. 
In the United States right now, 
today, energy costs are so high that 
one in six Americans are facing a no-
tice from their electric company that 
they may be disconnected—one in six. 
When I said these words just a couple 
of months ago, everybody on the other 
side of the aisle laughed at that propo-
sition. Yet, it is the policy that started 
with the flurry of activity last Janu-
ary, the executive orders that were 
aimed at killing the industry that un-
derpins our economy, the industry that 
won World War II, the industry that 
has lifted 1 billion people out of pov-
erty, 1 billion people around the world 
in places like sub-Saharan Africa, the 
Indian subcontinent, and the Far East. 
That is because of the shale revolution. 
That is because of technology. 
The Paris climate accords have abso-
lutely nothing on the reduction of 
harmful pollutants and emissions that 
private innovation has actually done. 
b 1230 
And even knowing this, President 
Biden and Democrats in Congress have 
introduced another tax on American 
energy that will continue to drive costs 
up. 
How many more Americans will be 
unable to heat their homes this fall 
and this winter when Democrat tax ini-
tiatives make their utility bills 50 per-
cent more expensive than last year? 
Does the Green New Deal lobby group 
want America to follow in the foot-
steps of the Europeans I just men-
tioned who have returned—literally re-
turned to burning wood chips in their 
homes? 
Restarting coal plants, where was 
that in the Green New Deal? Where was 
that in the Paris climate accord in 
COP26? 
Make no mistake. These costs will 
swiftly be passed along to the 180 mil-
lion Americans and 5.5 million busi-
nesses that rely on natural gas. 
In fact, the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office now estimates this 
fee will increase taxes by $6.5 billion 
and raise natural gas bills an addi-
tional 17 percent, in addition to the in-
flationary pressures already facing our 
economy. What an inexcusable error.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7981 
September 20, 2022 
Instead of encouraging more U.S. 
production of oil and gas, House Demo-
crats have opted instead to cut govern-
ment checks to favored green special 
interest groups. 
And by the way, what happened to 
the President’s promise not to raise 
taxes on Americans earning less than 
400,000? It is laughable. 
Americans are begging for lower 
prices. They are begging for the gov-
ernment to simply allow free market 
principles to work; to allow the compa-
nies that underpin energy to do what 
they do best, which is to do it better, 
to do it more efficient; to do it cleaner 
and to not be dependent on adversaries 
like Russia and China and other adver-
saries. 
The crowning achievement of Presi-
dent Biden’s energy policies will be de-
pendence on adversaries for our energy 
needs. 
In 
Maslow’s 
hierarchy, 
I 
couldn’t think of something that is 
worse; dependence on OPEC oil as he 
goes to Saudi Arabia asking for more 
production when we can do it here bet-
ter. 
We only need to look at the reckless 
policies in Europe to understand how 
bad this can be. We only need to look 
at the dependence that Europe had on 
Russia that has now, in many, many 
ways, led to a crisis in Ukraine. 
Energy underpins everything. And I 
am tired of hearing that we are in an 
energy transition. We are not. We are 
in an energy expansion. 
Another billion people will be added 
to the population of this globe within 
the next 15 to 20 years, one billion. 
Where is their energy going to come 
from? Can those people afford electric 
vehicles? 
Where does electricity come from? 
These are the questions it would be 
nice to have in a transparent, open, 
and realistic debate. In this energy ex-
pansion, I invite my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to come to my 
district to see the fact that my con-
gressional district has more wind en-
ergy than the entire State of Cali-
fornia. Come see what we do with re-
gards to solar. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Come to my district 
to see that, in this energy expansion, it 
is going to take every available source 
of energy. But most importantly, it is 
going to take reliable energy, base-load 
energy, sources that are primary that 
can provide the reliability. 
We don’t need to go the direction 
that Europe has gone, and we certainly 
don’t need to go the direction that our 
friends in California have gotten used 
to with rolling blackouts. 
And we don’t need higher taxes. 
Every American family is struggling. 
The solution is literally directly below 
our feet. It is literally at the hands of 
the most innovative and experienced 
entrepreneurs, engineers, hardworking 
patriots. It is here. We can provide that 
reliability and reduce dependency. 
I urge my colleagues to cast their 
vote for the American family, for the 
senior on a fixed income, for the small 
business owner, and for energy secu-
rity. 
And let me issue a warning. If we 
continue down this path, it will end in 
energy poverty right here in this coun-
try; and those that will be affected 
most are the vulnerable in our popu-
lation, the ones that are disconnected 
from their energy companies; the ones 
that can’t afford to do anything be-
cause energy costs are so high. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 8749 which 
would strike the new tax on natural 
gas, and get us on a path, once again, 
to energy dominance, energy security 
and reliability. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I remind my friend, Mr. PFLUGER, 
that this bill is about separating loans. 
It is not about the energy policy, al-
though I will address some of his re-
marks in a second. 
This is about the some 14,000 people 
that have taken advantage, clearly of 
consolidating loans, but since that 
point, there has been some disruption 
in their marriage. So we now have peo-
ple, as I mentioned earlier, that have 
been divorced for 17 years, still bur-
dened by a student loan of their ex- 
spouse and, in that particular instance, 
an ex-spouse who had been abusive and 
continues to refuse to pay his share of 
the loan. 
So this gives the spouse who was in 
the abusive relationship, the spouse 
who can’t find the ex-spouse to help 
take care of this joint loan, the ability 
to separate, take care of their own 
loans, and take advantage of other pro-
grams that we, in Congress, the admin-
istration, Democrats and Republicans, 
have put into place, like the public 
loan forgiveness. 
If you are working for the govern-
ment, in some instances, you can get 
credit for that service. Many of these 
people have been unable to take advan-
tage of that. So that is what this bill is 
about. That is what this rule is about. 
Now, as to my friend, I would say to 
him, you know, gas prices—I don’t 
know about Texas, maybe Texas has 
higher gas prices than Colorado. But in 
Colorado, the gas prices have dropped a 
buck 30 to a buck 50 over the course of 
the last 4 months, to the point where it 
is under three bucks. 
Madam Speaker, I refer my friend to 
the article in The New York Times and 
that I will include in the RECORD ti-
tled: ‘‘U.S. Gas Prices Have Fallen for 
91 Straight Days, a Relief for Con-
sumers.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Sept. 13, 2022] 
U.S. GAS PRICES HAVE FALLEN FOR 91 
STRAIGHT DAYS, A RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS 
(By Isabella Simonetti) 
The price of gasoline continues to fall 
steadily, easing pressure on American con-
sumers as the cost of filling a tank contin-
ued to tumble from record levels reached 
earlier in the summer. 
Gas prices fell 10.6 percent in August, 
which helped moderate still-sky-high infla-
tion, Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index report 
showed. 
The energy index, which tracks gasoline 
and electricity among other energy sources, 
dropped 5 percent last month, as electricity 
and natural gas prices rose. 
After peaking at $5.02 in June, gasoline 
prices have dropped for 91 straight days, and 
the national average stood at just over $3.70 
a gallon on Tuesday, data from AAA show. 
But analysts point to a few reasons this 
streak of declines is unlikely to continue. 
Because they’re determined by oil prices, 
gasoline prices are also susceptible to a wide 
range of challenges, like hurricanes that 
knock out drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and 
efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of 
Ukraine by curbing its ability to sell crude 
on the global market. 
While gas prices are down, the overall en-
ergy index still remains up 23.8 percent over 
the 12 months that ended in August. Elec-
tricity prices alone jumped 15.8 percent, rep-
resenting the largest 12–month increase 
since August 1981, the inflation report said. 
The jump in electricity prices is largely at-
tributable to the high cost of natural gas, 
said Laura Rosner-Warburton, an economist 
at MacroPolicy Perspectives. 
As winter approaches, other fuel prices 
could influence inflation data. The cost of 
heating a home with natural gas, the most 
common source of home-heating fuel in the 
United States, is expected to jump more 
than 25 percent from last year, to $952 for the 
six months from October through March, ac-
cording to the National Energy Assistance 
Directors Association. 
‘‘You would expect that a hard winter 
could create a significant increase in demand 
in price of natural gas,’’ said Bryan Benoit, 
U.S. national managing partner of energy at 
Grant Thornton. ‘‘And then of course all of 
this is further exacerbated by what’s going 
on with the war in the Ukraine.’’ 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I would also say to my friend from 
Texas, as it relates to inflation, the 
gentleman is correct. There has been, 
on a year-over-year basis, a jump of 
about 8 percent, 8.3 percent, I think he 
mentioned. But since the beginning of 
the year, that has fallen dramatically. 
Of course, over the summer we saw 
deflation in a couple of months, and 
the most recent inflation report in Au-
gust 
was 
it 
rose 
.1 
percent. 
So, 
annualized, that is a 1.2 percent infla-
tion rate now because we are seeing 
prices drop, particularly in the energy 
sector. 
So as much as my friends on the 
other side would like to wish that we 
had inflation, it is going away because 
we have been able to pass legislation 
like the Inflation Reduction Act, which 
takes a good look at both climate re-
sponsibilities that we have in urging 
and incentivizing towards renewable 
energy. But it also has a huge piece in 
there to allow us to negotiate prescrip-
tion drug prices and bring those down. 
So I would say to my friends on the 
other side, this bill is about dealing 
with loans, consolidated loans that 
now need to be separated. 
But on the subjects brought up, I can 
tell you that inflation is dropping

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7982 
September 20, 2022 
based on the most recent reports, and 
gas prices are falling. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
we did address some of the issues that 
we have and the concerns we have re-
garding the bill that is in front of us. 
But we also offered a previous question 
because we should be talking about en-
ergy. 
The American public is concerned 
about energy independence and what is 
happening with energy; how they are 
going to cool and, in my case, in Min-
nesota, how we are going to heat our 
homes. It gets cold in Minnesota, and 
people are concerned about how they 
are going to heat their homes this win-
ter and what they will have to cut out 
of their family budget if prices con-
tinue to rise on heating their homes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. 
ARMSTRONG) to discuss it even further. 
And it is cold in North Dakota, too. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, 
it is actually pretty nice in North Da-
kota right now, but we are on our way 
to winter. 
Saying gas prices have lowered 91 
days in a row is a whole lot like giving 
a medal to an arsonist for helping put 
out a fire he started. Gas prices are not 
lower than when President Biden took 
office, and other energy prices are con-
tinuing to rise. 
And I want to see the report that 
says inflation has gone down because I 
have seen it has gone up in the most 
recent numbers to 8.3 percent. I think 
there was very great dueling chryons 
going on as we are celebrating an Infla-
tion Reduction Act that does nothing 
to reduce inflation while the stock 
market is tanking, and we get a new 
report that inflation is actually going 
up. 
But I would urge my colleagues to 
defeat the previous question so we can 
consider 
commonsense 
policy 
that 
would reverse the decision by 220 
Democrats in this Chamber to tax 
American energy producers and raise 
prices on consumers. 
Democrats frame their price-increas-
ing $1,500 methane tax as a way to re-
duce emissions, but the small and me-
dium oil and gas companies in States 
like mine were already taking steps to 
reduce pollution in an economically 
viable way. These small and medium 
companies are the ones that drive en-
ergy production, particularly in North 
Dakota, and are going to be double-reg-
ulated from the wellhead to the mar-
ket. 
The structure of the methane pro-
gram is unwieldy; it is burdensome, 
and it will only serve to increase prices 
for consumers. And we have seen just 
that. 
In New York, a typical customer’s 
electric bill is expected to increase by 
29 percent from last year—29 percent. 
Ratepayers in New Hampshire saw 
the price of electricity double over the 
summer. 
With one in six families falling be-
hind on their utility bills, and winter 
right around the corner, the last thing 
we need are policies that make it more 
expensive to produce energy in the 
United States. We need to take the 
handcuffs off domestic producers and 
deliver affordable, clean, and reliable 
energy. 
In any rational place in the world, 
California’s energy policies, where they 
are demanding electric vehicles by 2035 
and, 2 days later, ask people to not 
charge their electric vehicles, and the 
energy policies of our allies in Ger-
many and other countries in Europe 
that are seeing the highest utility 
rates of any civilized country in the 
world should be a big, red blinking stop 
sign. 
But we are not in a rational world. 
We are in Washington, D.C., and in-
stead of taking the time to reflect and 
take reasonable steps to ensure that 
our country doesn’t go down the same 
path as these other places, we double 
down on policies that will not work, 
and they have the added benefit of not 
actually doing anything to clean up 
the environment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to 
defeat the previous question so we can 
go back and deal with an energy policy 
that is based on reality and not ide-
ology. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
With respect to the bill that we have 
before us and the rule that we have be-
fore us involving the separation of 
these loans, I would just say there was 
a woman named Angela who is on the 
hook for nearly $200,000, she has been 
divorced since 2016. 
What she owes is five times what her 
initial loan was because of this consoli-
dation of loans. And she suffered from 
domestic violence and has had her 
credit score drop like a rock. She is 
faced with crippling debt. And until we 
are able to uncouple and decouple these 
joint loans through this separation 
loan act, she is going to continue to be 
burdened by something that really is 
not her responsibility. 
That is the bill we are here to really 
debate and discuss, S. 1098. And obvi-
ously, the rule is to allow its debate on 
the floor of this House. 
This weekend, I was out walking pre-
cincts on Saturday—going back to the 
energy discussion that we are having. 
And at one of the houses was a young 
man getting his electrical engineering 
degree at the Colorado School of 
Mines. And he didn’t really recognize 
too many of the candidates. 
But he did say that he was familiar 
with the Inflation Reduction Act be-
cause it is the first time we have done 
anything of any real significance for a 
long time to deal with climate change, 
and he was very appreciative of that. A 
gentleman who doesn’t have an affili-
ation; he is not a Democrat, he is not 
a Republican, unaffiliated. But he was 
aware of the substantial policy changes 
and investments we are making to deal 
with extreme climate that we face all 
across this country. 
I am glad it is nice in North Dakota 
right now. But across the country, we 
have seen wildfires at times that no-
body has ever experienced before. We 
have seen terrible floods, and we con-
tinue to see the ocean rise. 
b 1245 
There are so many pieces to that In-
flation Reduction Act dealing with im-
proving our climate and dealing with 
the change that I certainly was proud 
to have supported it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing. 
Just before I get into my formal re-
marks, I just want to mention, we did 
a quick Google search, because I know 
that my colleague from Colorado just 
mentioned the dropping gas prices ear-
lier in his comments. We did a quick 
Google search, and in 2019, the gas 
prices in Colorado were $2.14, and they 
are currently in 2022, $3.70. So those gas 
prices, while you may say they are 
going down a bit, that is a significant 
increase from 2019. 
Madam Speaker, S. 1098 is well inten-
tioned, but there are other ways to ac-
complish this goal effectively. The cur-
rent bill will not help victims of abuse 
for a year or more. The Republican bill 
would help them now. 
The bill we are debating today in-
cludes vague language that creates 
loopholes that would allow the admin-
istration to spend billions of tax dol-
lars on broader loan forgiveness with-
out justification and oversight. The 
Republican bill closes this loophole to 
ensure that those who really need the 
help are the ones receiving it. 
We owe it to the victims of abuse to 
have a straightforward and efficient 
process to help them, and we owe the 
taxpayers to protect their tax dollars. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule 
and encourage Members to do the 
same, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
I compliment my friend or her 
Googling talent, because I am sure that 
is true. The situation that we faced is 
gas prices shot up to about 41⁄2 bucks, 
and they have dropped now almost to 
$3, or in places across the State, less 
than $3. 
But, obviously, in Colorado, we are 
enjoying a very good economy. Vir-
tually everybody is working. We have 
an unbelievably low unemployment 
rate. So we feel gas prices are going in 
the right direction, prices generally are 
going in the right direction, and there 
are a lot of people to credit for that, 
starting with the President of the 
United States. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues for joining me here today to 
speak on the rule and the Joint Con-
solidation Loan Separation Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7983 
September 20, 2022 
Over the course of the Joint Consoli-
dation Loan program, more than 14,000 
borrowers participated. It seemed like 
a simple consent. Joint consolidation 
loans allowed for couples to have one 
single monthly payment with a lower 
interest rate, but Congress never pro-
vided a way for individuals to separate 
their loans if and when the time came 
necessary; whether it is an abusive re-
lationship where there is domestic vio-
lence, economic abuse, or you simply 
can’t find your ex-spouse to have them 
help carry the burden. 
To my friends on the other side of 
the aisle who claim they want to help 
these borrowers, the opportunity to 
help them is right here, right now. Bor-
rowers who have experienced physical 
and mental abuse from former partners 
who now refuse to pay their student 
loans, like my constituent from Wheat 
Ridge, say this legislation would set 
them free. Supporting this legislation 
is the right thing to do to help bor-
rowers who for years have been stuck 
in these joint loans with no way out. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and on the previous ques-
tion. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1361 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
8749) to repeal the methane emissions and 
waste reduction incentive program for petro-
leum and natural gas systems. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
any amendment thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Energy & Commerce; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 8749. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time, 
and I move the previous question on 
the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question are post-
poned. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess for a pe-
riod of less than 15 minutes. 
Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 50 
minutes p.m.), the House stood in re-
cess. 
b 1300 
AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Mr. KAHELE) at 1 p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pro-
ceedings will resume on questions pre-
viously postponed. 
Votes will be taken in the following 
order: 
Ordering the previous question; 
Adoption of House Resolution 1361, if 
ordered; 
En bloc motion to suspend the rules, 
if offered; 
A motion to suspend the rules and 
pass S. 2490. 
The first electronic vote will be con-
ducted as a 15-minute vote. Pursuant 
to clause 9 of rule XX, remaining elec-
tronic votes will be conducted as 5- 
minute votes. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, the 
unfinished business is the vote on or-
dering the previous question on the 
resolution (H. Res. 1361) providing for 
consideration of the bill (S. 1098) to 
amend the Higher Education Act of 
1965 to authorize borrowers to separate 
joint consolidation loans, on which the 
yeas and nays were ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays 
206, not voting 7, as follows:

national partners to disrupt the narcotics in-
frastructure of the Assad regime. 
(5) A strategy for mobilizing a public com-
munications campaign to increase awareness 
of the extent of the connection of the Assad

RUSSIA CRYPTOCURRENCY TRANSPARENCY ACT 
H.R. 7338 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Russia 
Cryptocurrency Transparency Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On February 24, 2022, the Government of 
the Russian Federation, led by Vladimir 
Putin, launched an unprovoked, full-scale in-
vasion of Ukraine. 
(2) This unprovoked act of aggression vio-
lates Ukraine’s right to independence, sov-
ereignty, and territorial integrity, and con-
stitutes an emergency in international rela-
tions. 
(3) The invasion by the Government of the 
Russian Federation of Ukraine caused sig-
nificant displacement in Ukraine and trig-
gered a broader humanitarian crisis in Eu-
rope. 
(4) On March 23, 2022, the Department of 
State released a statement assessing that 
the Russian Armed Forces committed war 
crimes by launching indiscriminate attacks 
on civilians and non-military infrastructure, 
including apartment buildings, schools, and 
hospitals, leaving thousands of innocent ci-
vilians killed or wounded. 
(5) The United Nations Office for Coordina-
tion of Humanitarian Affairs has projected 
that, over the next three months, 12,000,000 
people living in Ukraine will need humani-
tarian assistance, 6,700,000 people will be in-
ternally displaced, and 4,000,000 people will 
flee Ukraine.

September 20, 2022 
(6) Rapid humanitarian assistance is nec-
essary 6 across sectors to address the needs 
of refugees and internally displaced persons 
from Ukraine. 
(7) Cryptocurrency has been used as an ef-
fective cross-border payment tool to send 
millions to the Ukrainian Government, 
Ukrainian army, and Ukrainian refugees 
with limited access to financial services. 
(8) In response to the war of aggression by 
the Government of the Russian Federation, 
the United States has imposed an array of 
sanctions, cutting off major Russian finan-
cial institutions from Western markets and 
freezing the assets of numerous Russian 
oligarchs. 
(9) Given that regimes sanctioned by the 
United States have used cryptocurrencies to 
evade sanctions, there are increasing con-
cerns that these digital assets may be used 
to circumvent the sanctions now imposed on 
Russia and Belarus by the United States and 
other foreign countries.

made the determination to pay out rewards 
in cryptocurrency; 
(2) lists each cryptocurrency payment al-
ready provided by the State Department; 
(3)

evidence 
as 
to 
why 
cryptocurrency payments would be more

ward with information than rewards paid out 
in United States dollars or other prizes; 
(4) analyzes how the State Department’s 
use of cryptocurrency could undermine the 
dollar’s status as the global reserve cur-
rency; and

could be used for criminal or illicit purposes.

priate committees of Congress’’ means—

nancial stability and national security inter-
est of the United States, including issues re-

States government to work with private sec-
tor actors to combat the evasion of sanctions

SECURING GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT 
H.R. 8503 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing 
Global Telecommunications Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress as follows: 
(1) The United States Government should 
promote and take steps to ensure American 
leadership in strategic technology indus-
tries, including telecommunications infra-
structure and other information and commu-
nications technologies. 
(2) The expansive presence of companies 
linked to the Chinese Communist Party, 
such as Huawei, in global mobile networks 
and the national security implications there-
of, such as the ability of the People’s Repub-
lic of China to exfiltrate the information 
flowing through those networks and shut off 
countries’ internet access, demonstrates the 
importance of the United States remaining 
at the technological frontier and the dire 
consequences of falling behind. 
(3) The significant cost of countering 
Huawei’s market leadership in telecommuni-
cations infrastructure around the world un-
derscores the urgency of supporting the com-
petitiveness of United States companies in 
next-generation information and commu-
nication technology. 
(4) To remain a leader at the International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and pre-
serve the ITU’s technical integrity, the 
United States must work with emerging 
economies and developing nations to bolster 
global telecommunications security and pro-
tect American national security interests. 
(5) Multilateral cooperation with like- 
minded partners and allies is critical to 
carry out the significant effort of financing 
and promoting secure networks around the 
world and to achieve market leadership of 
trusted vendors in this sector.

UNION
TO
DESIGNATE 
HIZBALLAH IN ITS ENTIRETY AS A TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION 
H. RES. 558 
Whereas, in April 1983, a Hizballah terror 
attack against the United States Embassy in 
Beirut killed 63 people; 
Whereas, in October 1983, a Hizballah ter-
ror attack against the United States Marine 
barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killed 241 
American and 58 French servicemembers 
supporting the Multinational Force peace-
keeping mission; 
Whereas, in July 2012, a Hizballah terror 
attack, carried out by an operative with dual 
Lebanese-French citizenship, in Burgas, Bul-
garia, killed 5 Israeli tourists and 1 Bul-
garian; 
Whereas, in March 2013, a Swedish-Leba-
nese Hizballah operative in Cyprus was con-
victed of planning terror attacks against 
Israeli tourists; 
Whereas, in June 2015, a Hizballah opera-
tive was sentenced to 6 years in prison after 
he stockpiled more than 8 tons of ammonium 
nitrate in Cyprus; 
Whereas the Hizballah International Fi-
nancing Prevention Act of 2015 (Public Law 
114–102) and the Hizballah International Fi-
nancing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–272) broadened financial sec-
tor sanctions against Hizballah to compel 
foreign financial institutions to refrain from 
supporting the terrorist group; 
Whereas, in May 2018, the Department of 
the Treasury imposed sanctions on Abdullah 
Safi-Al-Din, Hizballah’s representative to 
Iran, Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, a Hizballah 
financier, and blacklisted 5 of Bazzi’s compa-
nies, including Belgian energy services con-
glomerate Global Trading Group NV; 
Whereas, in October 2018, French police 
raided the Islamic Zahra Centre on suspicion 
of supporting Hizballah, freezing the organi-
zation’s funds, and seizing illegal weapons; 
Whereas, in September 2020, 4 former lead-
ers of the Zahra Centre France were arrested 
on suspicion of continuing to run the asso-
ciation; 
Whereas, in July 2019, the Department of 
the Treasury designated 2 Hizballah-backed 
members of Lebanese Parliament, Amin 
Sherri and Muhammad Hasan Ra’d, and 
Hizballah security official Wafiq Safa, stat-
ing that Hizballah uses its operatives in par-
liament to advance its violent activities; 
Whereas, as of April 2020, Germany be-
lieved there to be 1,050 people with suspected 
links to Hizballah in the country; 
Whereas Europol’s June 2020 European 
Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 
outlined that Hizballah is ‘‘suspected of traf-
ficking diamonds and drugs and of money 
laundering via the trade in second-hand 
cars’’, and the report also stated that ‘‘inves-
tigations 
face 
the 
difficulty 
of 
dem-
onstrating that the funds collected are chan-
neled to the military wing of the organiza-
tion’’; 
Whereas United States-led Project Cas-
sandra and Operation Cedar exposed the 
criminal-business wing of Hizballah, the 
Business 
Affairs 
Component 
(BAC) 
of 
Hezbollah’s External Security Organization; 
Whereas, 
during 
Project 
Cassandra, 
Hizballah elements involved in drug traf-
ficking were arrested in the United States, 
South America, and several European coun-
tries, including France, Belgium, Germany, 
and Italy; 
Whereas Hizballah’s criminal activity in 
Europe is run by the BAC, which reports to 
the External Security Organisation, also 
known as Unit 910, or the Islamic Jihad Or-
ganization, 
and 
Abdallah 
Safieddine, 
Hizballah’s representative in Iran, is also in-
volved in this activity; 
Whereas, in August 2020, United Nations 
Secretary General Guterres called on Leb-
anon to disarm Hizballah, citing the terror 
group’s persistent violation of Resolution 
1701 (2006); 
Whereas Iran is the prime sponsor of 
Hizballah, harboring, financing, training, 
and arming the group; 
Whereas the Department of the Treasury 
and Department of State estimate that Iran 
provides as much as $700,000,000 per year to 
Hizballah in the form of financial and 
logistical support, weapons, and training; 
Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of 
approximately 150,000 missiles and rockets, 
many of which can reach deep into Israel; 
Whereas Hizballah fighters have been sup-
porting the Assad regime in Syria, often 
leading operations in the conflict which has 
left more than 500,000 dead; 
Whereas Hizballah’s destabilizing actions 
in Syria have contributed to a migrant crisis 
that has brought over 700,000 refugees to Eu-
rope; 
Whereas Hizballah trains and provides 
weapons for militias in Iraq and Yemen, fur-
ther destabilizing the region and perpet-
uating violence in those countries; 
Whereas Hizballah activities continue to 
plague Lebanon with profound economic and 
political instability and violence; 
Whereas, in August 2020, at least 220 people 
died and thousands more were injured when 
a massive stockpile of ammonium nitrate ex-
ploded in Beirut’s port; 
Whereas Hizballah’s cross border illicit 
arms and drugs trafficking undermines the 
Lebanese Armed Forces, the legitimate secu-
rity establishment of the country as outlined 
in United Nations Security Council Resolu-
tion 1701 (2006); 
Whereas, in October 2012, Hizballah Deputy 
Secretary General Naim Qassem stated that 
‘‘[Hizballah does not] have a military wing 
and a political one . . . Every element of 
Hizballah, from commanders to members as 
well as our various capabilities, are in the 
service of the resistance’’; 
Whereas the United States, Germany, the 
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Estonia, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Serbia, and 
Kosovo, 
among 
others, 
have 
designated 
Hizballah in its entirety as a terror organiza-
tion; 
Whereas, in March 2016, the Gulf Coopera-
tion Council formally branded Hizballah, in 
its entirety, a terrorist organization, and the 
League of Arab States shortly thereafter 
adopted the same designation; 
Whereas the Department of the Treasury 
has diligently added persons and entities to 
the list of Specially Designated Global Ter-
rorists who have provided material support 
to the Hizballah terrorist organization, 
thereby 
hampering 
its 
financing 
and 
logistical capabilities; 
Whereas the European Union, in July 2013, 
designated Hizballah’s so-called ‘‘military 
wing’’, but not the organization as a whole, 
as a terrorist organization; 
Whereas, 
despite 
restrictions 
put 
on 
Hizballah since the designation of its mili-
tary wing, the group continues to conduct il-
licit narcotrafficking, money laundering, 
and weapons trafficking throughout Europe 
and the world; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives has 
previously called on the European Union to 
fully designate Hizballah as a terrorist orga-
nization, passing House Resolution 359 in Oc-
tober 2017: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—

the United States and the European Union 
(EU) in thwarting Hizballah’s criminal and 
terrorist activities; 
(2) supports transcontinental efforts within 
Europe to share intelligence information 
among police and security services to facili-
tate greater cooperation in tracking, appre-
hending, and prosecuting terrorists, foreign 
fighters, and potential offenders; 
(3) encourages the European Union to im-
plement sanctions against Hizballah-affili-
ated terrorists in tandem with the United 
States; 
(4) recommends greater civil society en-
gagement in both the United States and Eu-
rope to underscore Hizballah’s malign re-
gional influence; and 
(5) urges the European Union to designate 
Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist orga-
nization and increase pressure on the group, 
including through— 
(A) facilitating better cross-border co-
operation between European Union members 
in combating Hizballah; 
(B) issuing arrest warrants against mem-
bers and active supporters of Hizballah; 
(C) freezing Hizballah’s assets in Europe, 
including those masquerading as charities; 
and 
(D) prohibiting fundraising activities in 
support of Hizballah. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 2 of House Resolution 
1361, the ordering of the yeas and nays 
on postponed motions to suspend the 
rules with respect to such measures is 
vacated to the end that all such mo-
tions are considered as withdrawn. 
The question is on the motion offered 
by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bills and agree to 
the resolution. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
This is a 5-minute vote.

SCOTT) and the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on S. 1098. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in 
support of the bipartisan, bicameral 
Joint Consolidation Loan Separation 
Act, led in the Senate by my colleague 
from Virginia, Senator MARK WARNER, 
and led in the House by the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE). 
Student loans should provide a path-
way to opportunity, not saddle bor-
rowers with a lifetime of burdensome 
debt, especially if the loans don’t even 
belong to them. 
Regrettably, many borrowers’ finan-
cial well-being has been made worse by 
student loans jointly held by their 
spouse or former spouse. 
The Joint Consolidation Loan Sepa-
ration Act would provide much-needed 
relief for individuals who previously 
consolidated their student loans with 
their spouse. Although Congress elimi-
nated the joint consolidation loan pro-
gram in 2006, it did not provide a way 
for borrowers to sever existing loans, 
even in the event of domestic violence, 
domestic abuse, or unresponsiveness 
from a former spouse after a divorce. 
As a result, according to the most re-
cent data from the Department of Edu-
cation, there are at least 13,500 bor-
rowers with federally held joint con-
solidation loans. 
The Joint Consolidation Loan Sepa-
ration Act would allow borrowers to 
submit an application to the Depart-
ment of Education to split the joint 
consolidation loan into two separate 
Federal direct loans. The two new Fed-
eral direct loans would be split propor-
tionally based on the original unpaid 
principal and have the same interest 
rates as the joint consolidation loan, 
ensuring borrowers are not saddled 
with a higher interest rate. 
Importantly, the bill provides a path-
way for an individual to apply to sepa-
rate a loan from a spouse, a current 
spouse or former spouse, including in 
the event of an absentee or unrespon-
sive spouse, for an act of violence or 
economic abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, we can all agree that no 
borrower should be forced to pay a debt 
that isn’t theirs, especially the debt of 
an abusive former spouse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume, and I 
thank my colleague for yielding the 
time. 
While I fully support the underlying 
intent of S. 1098, the Joint Consolida-
tion Loan Separation Act, I have con-
cerns about the bill as drafted. The 
purpose of this bill is to protect stu-
dent loan borrowers who consolidated 
their loans with a spouse but now seek 
to reverse this process. Yet, as written, 
this bill undermines that purpose. 
I am concerned this bill will hurt the 
very borrowers we are trying to help. 
We never want to see a spouse, espe-
cially one that is a victim of domestic 
violence, forced to be financially tied 
to his or her abuser. We want to give 
these borrowers a way out. However, 
we also recognize that it is not only 
the abused spouse who may be applying 
for these new consolidations. 
Under the Senate-passed language, 
when a borrower files for a new consoli-
dated loan, he or she could potentially 
leave his or her spouse with the re-
maining balance. We must be cognizant 
of the fact that a borrower could use 
this new legislation as a weapon. This 
is why we need safeguards in place to 
ensure that both parties are not sub-
ject to potential abuse through the sep-
aration process and not just the one fil-
ing for a new consolidation. 
Additionally, the Department of Edu-
cation has stated that it will take 12 to 
18 months to implement this bill. 
Given the urgency of the situation that 
many borrowers are in, this kind of 
delay is unacceptable. We need to pro-
vide these borrowers with a quicker 
way out of their joint consolidation 
loan. Yet, Democrats rejected the Re-
publicans’ solution that will give these 
borrowers an almost immediate separa-
tion without unnecessary paperwork 
that will bog down the process. 
Further, I am concerned that this 
bill could be used by the Secretary of 
Education to stage an even broader 
takeover of student loans. It would be 
simpler and more straightforward to 
allow these loans, once separated, to 
remain with their current holder, but 
instead, this legislation attempts to 
drive as many of these loans as possible 
into the government-run Direct Loan 
program. 
We have ample evidence to believe 
that the Biden Department of Edu-
cation will take the inch given in this 
legislation and use it to go a mile. The 
administration’s illegal expansion of 
the income-driven repayment program 
and Public Service Loan Forgiveness 
program, let alone Biden’s student loan 
bailout, are evidence of that. 
For example, the vague language in-
cluded in this bill, namely, the author-
ity for the Secretary of Education to 
allow for new consolidation loans if it 
is in ‘‘the fiscal interest of the Federal 
Government.’’ The Department of Edu-
cation has not been able to provide 
clarity on what this phrase means or 
how it applies to this bill, but it has 
been used previously by this adminis-
tration to force billions of dollars’ 
worth of loans made by private lenders

onto the government’s books. More-
over, the President’s $1 trillion trans-
fer of wealth from hardworking tax-
payers to college graduates clearly il-
lustrates this administration had no 
intention of protecting ‘‘the fiscal in-
terests of the Federal Government.’’ 
We must not create any loopholes or 
back doors for the Biden administra-
tion to exploit. Transferring massive 
amounts of student loan debt to tax-
payers is harming our economy and 
setting a horrible precedent for future 
borrowers, not to mention failing to 
solve the underlying problems in post-
secondary education. 
Because of these issues, Republicans 
have a solution that will allow student 
loan servicers to separate joint consoli-
dation loans almost immediately, in-
stead of having to wait over a year to 
receive relief. 
Our solution is a commonsense and 
practical way to accomplish the same 
goal as this legislation but more quick-
ly and efficiently. 
Republicans are willing to work 
across the aisle to ensure borrowers are 
taken 
care 
of, 
but 
unfortunately, 
Democrats are more focused on open-
ing more avenues for the administra-
tion to expand its radical loan bailout. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the 
House sponsor of the legislation. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to rise in support 
of S. 1098, the Joint Consolidation Loan 
Separation Act. 
I am the author of the House version 
of this bill and have introduced it 
every Congress since the 115th, always 
with a Republican cosponsor. 
I would like to start my remarks 
today by thanking the Members, past 
and present, who have helped bring us 
to the floor today. 
I thank our former colleague BRAD-
LEY BYRNE of Alabama for his cospon-
sorship of the first iteration of this 
bill. I thank Congresswoman HALEY 
STEVENS and other current bipartisan 
cosponsors; Senators MARK
WARNER, 
MARCO RUBIO, and JOHN CORNYN, who 
recently steered this bill to passage in 
the Senate; and my colleague from 
North 
Carolina, 
Senator 
RICHARD 
BURR, who expedited the review of this 
bill by his committee. 
This bill passed the Senate by unani-
mous consent on June 15 of this year. 
I also thank my good friend Chair-
man BOBBY SCOTT and his staff. They 
have vetted this bill and worked over 
this bill very carefully. He is an out-
standing leader of the committee, and 
he has been a longstanding supporter of 
this bill. He included it, in fact, in var-
ious versions of the Higher Education 
Act. 
I also thank the staff, entrepre-
neurial staff, who picked up on this 
problem from casework years ago and 
devised a legislative solution. That 
would be Kate Roetzer and Nora 
Blalock of my staff initially, Janssen 
White and Elizabeth Adkins more re-
cently, and other personal and com-
mittee staff, House and Senate. 
Thanks, too, to the advocates, people 
affected by this problem, who have 
come to our offices and our town meet-
ings and relentlessly advocated for re-
lief. A number of these advocates are 
our guests in the gallery today. 
The Joint Consolidation Loan Sepa-
ration Act, or JCL for short, is simple 
in its intent but significant in its im-
pact on thousands of student loan bor-
rowers who have waited for relief for 
far too long. 
From 1993 to 2006, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education issued joint consoli-
dation loans to married couples where 
both borrowers agreed at the time to 
be jointly liable for repayment. As you 
might expect, this proved problematic 
if that couple ever needed or wanted to 
separate the loans. 
Congress wisely eliminated this pro-
gram in 2006 but with one critical over-
sight: Congress did not provide a means 
of severing the existing loans, even in 
the event of domestic abuse, economic 
abuse, or an unresponsive partner. 
There was, in other words, no grand-
father clause. 
As a result, there are borrowers na-
tionwide who remain financially liable 
for their absconded or abusive or un-
communicative 
spouse’s 
portion 
of 
their consolidated debt with no legal 
options for relief. 
The bill before us would allow such 
borrowers to submit an application to 
the Department of Education to split 
the joint consolidated loan into two 
separate Federal direct loans. The joint 
loan remainder would be split propor-
tionately based on the percentage that 
each borrower originally brought into 
the loan. 
It was an unfortunate mistake not to 
grandfather in the severing of these 
loans with the 2006 cancellation of the 
program, so this bill is a long overdue, 
commonsense 
correction. 
Congress 
does occasionally make mistakes; in 
case we hadn’t noticed. 
Let me just illustrate to you what 
the solution means for the lives of bor-
rowers. 
I first became aware of this issue in 
2014, 8 years ago, through constituent 
casework. My constituent consolidated 
his $25,000 loan with his ex-wife’s 
$75,000 loan. After their divorce, the 
Department continued to collect on the 
combined loan from both parties, even 
though my constituent had paid off his 
portion of the loan. That is just one of 
the many examples that cover the 
spectrum of unpleasant situations with 
this shared debt. 
Let’s assume that one partner at-
tended community college and the 
other an expensive private school, and 
their loan amounts are vastly dif-
ferent. When they consolidated their 
loans, they both agreed to be jointly 
liable for repayment. But say the part-
ner who attended private school be-
came unresponsive and stopped paying 
into the loan. That left the partner 
who attended community college sad-
dled with their total debt, along with 
the partner’s private school education 
cost. 
b 1445 
We have also heard horror stories of 
couples who have survived abusive re-
lationships but continue to remain tied 
to their partners through the loan. 
Former partners have exerted financial 
abuse by refusing to copay with their 
exes. In other instances, individuals 
are unable to get in contact with the 
copartner of their loan and are simi-
larly left to shoulder the debt all by 
themselves. 
These borrowers have seen their 
wages garnished and their credit scores 
ruined to the point where they cannot 
assist their own children in taking care 
of Federal student loans. This has be-
come a generational impact. 
These loan holders are often in pun-
ishing situations with no hope in sight 
for action to fix this mistake unless we 
pass the bill before us today. 
This bill has been thoroughly vetted 
by the Department of Education, the 
House Committee on Education and 
Labor, and numerous checkpoints in 
the Senate. It passed by unanimous 
consent in the Senate a few short 
months ago. We have made accom-
modations all along the way, including 
Republican changes that I did not pre-
fer, for the sake of getting the bill to 
the floor in both Chambers. With to-
morrow’s vote, it will go directly to 
the President’s desk. 
This is a bipartisan, bicameral piece 
of legislation. I believe it is the end 
product of a fair process that has with-
stood the rigors of legislative scrutiny. 
As far as legislative impact goes, this 
one is simple but profound in its im-
pact on borrowers. 
The Joint Consolidation Loan Sepa-
ration Act presents a rare opportunity 
for Congress to right a wrong, to cor-
rect an omission in its own legislative 
process. I urge that we do so. The bill 
offers a fair and equitable relief to bor-
rowers who have suffered great hard-
ship, and I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to S. 1098, which ex-
pands the Secretary of Education’s al-
ready 
illegitimate, 
unconstitutional 
authority, so-called, to transfer stu-
dent loan debt from those who bor-
rowed it to those who did not. 
How egregious, once again, that we 
would try to force taxpayers who did 
not go to college, who worked their 
way through college without incurring 
debt, or who paid off their student 
loans to now have to carry the debt for 
those making up to $250,000 a year, 
from a family standpoint. 
This is an effort to double the num-
ber of student loans where the debt will 
be transferred to hardworking tax-
payers. This bill allows new authority

September 20, 2022 
for the Secretary of Education to allow 
for new loans if it is in the ‘‘fiscal in-
terests of the Federal Government.’’ 
Now, that is an interesting concept. 
Since when does this majority consider 
the fiscal impact of their decisions? 
There is no limit to how many 
illegals they will allow to invade our 
country through the southern border, 
and there is no limit, seemingly, to 
how much money they will spend. The 
answer to every supposed problem is to 
spend more money, irrespective of the 
fiscal impact. 
Instead of considering the fiscal im-
pact on the Federal Government, by 
the way, which I suspect we will not do 
since the Federal Government doesn’t 
have any money, since the Federal 
Government is in debt for $31 trillion, 
which is $90,000 per citizen, how about 
if we consider the fiscal impact on the 
taxpayers who are on the hook for that 
$31 trillion and will be on the hook for 
this new spending that is being advo-
cated for today? 
The truth is this bill, this legislation, 
would add billions more to the already 
terrible decisions we have made fis-
cally in this Congress. The majority’s 
response to the $31 trillion national 
debt that we have already referenced 
most recently is to pass their inflation 
increase bill. That added $800 billion 
more in spending, half of it for green 
raw deal spending, a couple hundred 
billion dollars for IRS agents, because I 
am sure you hear all across your dis-
trict, like I do, that the only thing we 
need is more IRS agents. 
Then, our other response, in addition 
to the inflation increase act, is to the 
student loan transfer fiasco, transfer-
ring debt from those who borrowed it 
to those who did not. Today, we will 
add billions more to that $600 billion 
conservative estimate on what the cost 
is of the student loan transfer scheme. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to oppose this bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
prior to yielding time, I yield myself 1 
minute just to remind those on the 
other side of the aisle, who have lec-
tured this side of the aisle on fiscal re-
sponsibility, that every Democratic 
Presidential administration since Ken-
nedy left office with a better deficit 
situation than they inherited—every 
one, without exception. And every Re-
publican since Nixon, every adminis-
tration left office with a worse deficit 
situation than they inherited, without 
exception. President Trump was well 
on his way to fulfilling that trend be-
fore the pandemic. 
But hypocrisy is not much of an 
issue. I just wanted to remind people 
who is fiscally responsible and who 
isn’t. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS), a distinguished member of the 
Committee on Education and Labor 
and an original cosponsor of this legis-
lation. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, in that 
vein, some of us are here to pontificate, 
and others of us are here to solve prob-
lems. 
I rise today for those who have been 
the victim of this oversight. From the 
period of 1993 to 2006, Americans filed 
for the consolidation of student loans, 
not realizing that they may fall prey to 
an 
unfortunate 
situation: 
domestic 
abuse; economic abuse; an unrespon-
sive partner; or divorce, which plagues 
50 percent of this population. 
Under the leadership of my friend 
and colleague, Congressman PRICE, we 
have a solution. We have a bill, the 
Joint Consolidation Loan Separation 
Act, which is bipartisan and which we 
should pass to help people. 
To those who have been victims—and 
I consider you victims—we offer our ex-
tension of empathy, but we also offer 
our extension of a solution. We have a 
good program here to allow you to re-
engage with the Department of Edu-
cation to make sure that you have fair-
ness with your loan. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
come together to pass this bill. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. MURPHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, first and foremost, I want to 
say how deeply I appreciate Mr. PRICE’s 
hard work over the last couple of years 
on S. 1098. I thank him very much for 
his efforts on this key and very bipar-
tisan issue. 
It is clear that there is bipartisan 
support that victims of spousal abuse 
should be able to sever these consolida-
tion loans without penalty or delay. I 
don’t think that is the question. The 
question here is the change in the cal-
culus because of what President Biden 
has done. 
While I support the intention of this 
bill to separate these loans, President 
Biden’s unconstitutional, only-able-to- 
be-done-because-of-his-abuse-of-power 
student loan giveaway has drastically 
changed the context in which we con-
sider this bill. The President, in his ac-
tions, has undermined what was a clear 
bipartisan effort. 
S. 1098 gives the administration the 
authority and creates a pathway which 
could be used for loan forgiveness, 
again taking money from people who 
didn’t benefit from a college education 
and making those individuals pay for 
it. 
Once these loans are separated into 
the Direct Loan Program, these loans 
will be eligible for Biden’s near-tril-
lion-dollar student loan giveaway. Re-
publicans made a good-faith effort to 
amend this legislation to protect tax-
payers, but Democrats refused to close 
this loan forgiveness loophole. 
Our Republican solution, the Sim-
plified Joint Consolidation Separation 
Act, will allow borrowers to separate 
their loans in a more timely manner to 
expedite financial freedom while pro-
tecting taxpayers by focusing on the 
administration’s authority to directly 
aid those most in need. 
This targeted, commonsense legisla-
tion should garner immediate support 
from both sides of the aisle and will ac-
tually correct the issue that we all 
want solved. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TONKO). Members are reminded to re-
frain from engaging in personalities to-
ward the President. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
would the Speaker advise how much 
time is remaining on both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 19 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
North Carolina has 20 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman of the full com-
mittee, Mr. SCOTT, for continuing to 
find ways to collaborate with his mem-
bers and others to ensure that we re-
spond to the crux of opportunity in 
America, and that is education. 
I am so grateful to be able to stand 
and support S. 1098 and to take this 
brief moment to thank my fellow alum, 
DAVID PRICE, for being persistent in 
this legislation and serving the Amer-
ican people over the years that he has 
done. I had a chance to get a second 
bite of the apple. DAVID was here and 
then came back. I have enjoyed every 
moment of his commitment to oppor-
tunities for Americans over the years, 
including housing and transportation 
and homeland security, and I certainly 
want to say to him that the American 
people are better for his service to this 
Nation. I thank him so very much. 
I am grateful to finally be able to 
say, Chairman SCOTT, to a constituent 
who I saw over the weekend that called 
the number of the bill—most times, 
constituents don’t know bill numbers. 
They said: ‘‘I need you to support S. 
1098.’’ Obviously, this is something so 
many of us have been looking to be-
cause we have heard this from our con-
stituents. 
I am very grateful that this legisla-
tion now allows a married couple who 
has previously consolidated their Fed-
eral student loans, because we were al-
lowed to do that—many people thought 
that was a good thing to do, to submit 
a joint application to the Department 
of Education to sever their loan, allow-
ing each former spouse their propor-
tional 
responsibility. 
Each 
former 
spouse would still be obligated for a 
share of the loan, but their share of re-
sponsibility would be benchmarked to 
the proportion of the debt that they 
brought into the consolidated loan. 
Without loan severance, if a spouse re-
fused to pay their share, the other 
spouse remains responsible for full pay-
ment. 
This is important legislation as it re-
lates to divorce and domestic violence 
or economic abuse. Bearing the risk of 
the full responsibility for a consoli-
dated loan after divorce can dramati-
cally restrain a spouse from moving on 
with their life, from supporting their 
children, from getting a house, from 
feeling safe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7997 
September 20, 2022 
The Joint Consolidation Loan Sepa-
ration Act also addresses the especially 
volatile situation of former relation-
ships in which an individual was sub-
jected to domestic or, as I said, eco-
nomic abuse. 
As a sponsor of the Violence Against 
Women Act that became law in March 
of last year, I am especially concerned 
about women who have experienced 
physical, mental, sexual, emotional, 
even psychological abuse at the hands 
of a spouse or partner. S. 1098 allows 
them to separate from toxic relation-
ships, get away from the economic 
abuse, and retain or maintain their 
credit so that they can go forward. 
This can also apply to a male who may 
be suffering from the same situation. 
Two married borrowers of Federal 
student loans could combine their debt 
into a single loan, but we can also 
come back now to ensure that they can 
separate it. This is an important step 
forward. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we 
enthusiastically add this to the compo-
nent of making sure, under the Vio-
lence Against Women Act, that there is 
an expanded understanding of what 
happens when one spouse abuses an-
other or the idea of economic abuse. 
b 1500 
Just as an example, when one spouse 
is not being timely, is not being re-
sponsive, for whatever reason is not 
able to be found, then the credit of the 
remaining spouse being dutiful is com-
pletely, if I might use the term, muti-
lated. 
I am eager to ensure that this bill is 
passed. I certainly acknowledge the 
Senator from the State of Texas, Sen-
ator CORNYN. We have worked together 
on other matters. 
I will let everybody know this bill is 
bipartisan, and I will let everyone 
know that what we will be doing is en-
suring that people can restore their 
lives. They can stand up again and be 
able to pay their debt. 
As I finish, I am stunned by people 
who don’t want to see us move forward 
for people to pay their debt. They can 
pay their debt. Let us all support S. 
1098. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1098, 
the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act 
allowing a jointly-held loan debt to be sepa-
rated. 
This legislation would allow a married cou-
ple, who had previously consolidation their 
federal student loan debts, to submit a joint 
application to the Department of Education to 
sever their loan, allotting to each former 
spouse their proportional responsibility. 
While each former spouse would still be ob-
ligated for a share of the loan, their share of 
responsibility would be benchmarked to the 
proportion of debt that they brought into the 
consolidated loan. Without loan severance, if a 
spouse refuses to pay their share of the loan, 
the other spouse remains responsible for full 
payment. 
This is very important legislation because it 
is a key to independence following a divorce. 
Without being able to sever their loan obliga-
tion after divorce, people are forced to con-
tinue interacting with their former spouse. 
Bearing the risk of full responsibility for a 
consolidated loan after divorce can dramati-
cally restrain a spouse from moving on with 
their life, both financially and emotionally, as 
they are forced to maintain communication 
with someone from whom they no longer want 
to be closely associated. 
The Joint Consolidation Loan Separation 
Act also addresses the especially volatile situ-
ation of former relationships in which an indi-
vidual was subjected to domestic or economic 
abuse from the other individual. 
As the sponsor of the Violence Against 
Women Act Reauthorization Act that became 
law in March of this year, I am especially con-
cerned about women who have experienced 
physical, mental, sexual, emotional, or psycho-
logical abuse at the hands of a spouse or 
partner. 
Thus, it is especially important that S. 1098 
make it easy for women who have suffered 
from abuse to sever their loans, to help them 
sever their toxic relationships. 
Indeed, S. 1098 allows one borrower to sub-
mit a separate application in the event that the 
individual has experienced domestic or eco-
nomic abuse from the other individual bor-
rower or is unable to reasonably access the 
loan information of the other borrower. 
In the case of this occurring, the other non- 
applying individual borrower shall become 
solely liable for the remaining balance of the 
joint consolidation loan. 
Joint consolidation loans were first created 
for the good of Americans to combat growing 
default rates. 
Two married borrowers of federal student 
loans could combine their debt into a single 
loan. 
While the legislation was intended to 
proactively accommodate these life situations, 
joint consolidation forms came with no guid-
ance from the Department of Education for 
cases of domestic or economic abuse. 
A divorce decree could not remove one 
spouse from the debt, nor could have any 
other agreement as both people were now le-
gally responsible for the combined debt. 
If an ex-spouse refused to pay their share of 
the monthly payment, the other spouse would 
have to make the entire payment themselves. 
If a former couple wanted to make their stu-
dent loan payments under a payment plan, 
both spouses would need to pay the loan 
under the same plan and provide their finan-
cial information. 
If one of them failed to do so, they would 
both be denied access to the payment plan. 
Because of all these loopholes, Congress 
eliminated access to joint consolidation loan 
applications in 2006. 
However, it did not provide a way to sepa-
rate responsibility for existing loans, even in 
cases of domestic violence, economic abuse, 
or an unresponsive partner. 
With the Joint Consolidation Loan Separa-
tion Act, we can now provide a way out for 
those facing domestic violence or economic 
abuse, as victims in this position face chal-
lenges beyond their own control. 
As reported by the CDC, about 1 in 4 
women and nearly 1 in 10 men have experi-
enced physical or sexual violence by an inti-
mate partner during their lifetime. 
According to the National Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence, between 94 and 99 per-
cent of domestic violence survivors have also 
experienced economic abuse, which includes 
coerced debt and withholding access to 
money. 
There are currently 776 borrowers with 
spousal consolidation loans, according to the 
Student Borrower Protection Center. 
It is our responsibility to do right for these 
borrowers who fell victim to the consequences 
of previous legislation. 
As the sponsor of H.R. 1620, the Violence 
Against Women Act Reauthorization Act, I 
proudly support S. 1098’s efforts to provide 
options for victims of violence, especially for 
women who are at a significantly higher risk. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment to S. 
1098 would establish a more efficient 
process for separating joint consolida-
tion loans to ensure timely relief for 
borrowers, protect victims of abuse 
seeking to sever their financial entan-
glement with their abuser, and protect 
taxpayers by ensuring that the Sec-
retary’s authority is narrowly tailored 
to help those in need. 
It allows borrowers to separate their 
loans immediately rather than having 
to apply for a new loan in the Direct 
Loan Program, a process that can take 
as long as 18 months to implement. 
Moreover, it ensures that those who 
are victims of economic or domestic 
abuse can split their loans without 
opening up avenues for their abuser to 
game the system and inflict further 
harm on those we are trying to help. 
This is a commonsense fix to a bill 
that all of us agree is well-intended but 
falls short of ensuring adequate safe-
guards for borrowers. 
S. 1098 also fails to protect against 
the abuse of executive authority, some-
thing this administration has already 
proven it will happily do. 
If we adopt the motion to commit, we 
will instruct the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor to consider my 
amendment to S. 1098 to establish a 
more efficient process for separating 
joint consolidation loans to ensure 
timely relief for borrowers that need it. 
I ask unanimous consent to insert 
the text of the amendment in the 
RECORD immediately prior to the vote 
on the motion to commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to pass the amendment so 
we can provide timely relief to the bor-
rowers who need it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. SCOTT, as well, for the out-
standing job that he has done. 
Mr. PRICE, I don’t know what more 
you can do. I really don’t. This bill is

bipartisan; it is bicameral; and, by 
God, we ought to pass it. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
consider the solution Republicans have 
put on the table. Borrowers wanting 
out of joint consolidated loans should 
have the opportunity to separate, but 
the method we use to get this done is 
important. 
S. 1098, the Joint Consolidation Loan 
Separation Act, will take the Depart-
ment 12 to 18 months to implement, far 
too long for some borrowers who are in 
urgent need of help. This legislation 
could also backfire on the very bor-
rowers we are all working to help. 
Additionally, this bill’s sloppy and 
vague language could pave the way for 
even more Federal power grabs over 
the student loan system. Given what 
we have seen from this administration, 
we cannot open any doors to further 
student loan debt schemes. 
Bottom line, S. 1098 delays support 
for borrowers who need assistance im-
mediately, cedes more control to the 
Education Secretary, and fails to pro-
tect the borrowers and taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, while the Joint Consoli-
dation Loan Separation Act does not 
solve the student loan debt crisis, it 
takes another sensible step to help bor-
rowers separate with loans that do not 
belong to them. This legislation also 
comes at a critical time when many 
borrowers seek relief under President 
Biden’s recently announced loan can-
cellation program. 
Unfortunately, 
not 
all 
borrowers 
with joint consolidation loans are cur-
rently eligible for relief, even if they 
meet all other criteria. 
Simply put, by advancing the Joint 
Consolidation Loan Separation Act, we 
are providing borrowers with addi-
tional avenues of loan relief, ensuring 
survivors of domestic or economic 
abuse are not responsible for their 
spouse’s or former spouse’s debt. 
Again, I thank Senator WARNER of 
Virginia and the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. PRICE) for their leader-
ship on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1361, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill.

CONGRATULATING 
LAS 
VEGAS 
ACES ON WNBA CHAMPIONSHIP 
WIN 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with excitement to congratulate 
the Las Vegas Aces for winning the 2022 
WNBA finals. 
The Las Vegas Aces are the first Las 
Vegas-based team to bring home a pro-
fessional sports championship. Before 
winning the championship, this team 
was built for success, having the best 
regular season record this year. 
Forward A’ja Wilson was named the 
WNBA Most Valuable Player for the 
second time in her career, and during 
the semifinals, point guard Chelsea 
Gray became the first player in WNBA 
history with more than 30 points and 10 
assists in a playoff game. 
In her first year as head coach, 
Becky Hammon led this championship 
team with determination and poise.

ECONOMICS 101 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, for-
give my getting organized. The floor 
has been moving a little faster than we 
expected. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to try a cou-
ple of things and try not to bore every-
one out of their minds over the next 
hour. Some of what I am going to 
touch on is going to be a little tech-
nical. Part of it is really cranky. 
I have a number of different boards, 
and they are going to try to hit dif-
ferent points in different orders. I will 
beg of staff, help me sort of get them 
all stacked up right here, if we could. 
First thing, I want to go to geek 
town for a moment. Just to put this in 
perspective, I have come to this floor 
since January talking about inflation. 
Now, how many of you remember the 
discussions we were all having—actu-
ally, it would be more had at us—that 
inflation was transitory. Now, they 
sort of apologize—the Federal Reserve, 
the Treasury Secretary Yellen, hope-
fully the White House, though the 
White House seems to be disconnected 
from reality—that it is not transitory. 
If you saw the numbers that came 
out last Thursday, Friday, we have 
something called structural. What does 
that mean to anyone? Does this place 
even care to understand? 
First, let’s do the first bit of geeky. 
When you hear a discussion that the 
yield curve is inverted, how many of 
you immediately reach over to your 
television and say, ‘‘Oh, God, I have 
the wrong channel on,’’ and turn it off? 
It is not that complicated. It is a way 
of people using big words to try to 
sound smart. 
Inverted yield curve just means, hey, 
I expect over the next 2 years to have 
higher inflation so the value of my dol-
lar goes down faster than I do over the 
10 years. 
That means if I buy a 10-year bond, I 
might be willing to take an interest 
rate here, but I expect inflation to be 
so high in the next 2 years, I want a 
higher interest rate because, theoreti-
cally, it is real simple: When things 
take longer, you should have more risk 
and, therefore, want a higher interest 
rate. 
Why is this important to a conversa-
tion on the floor of the House? Go look 
on your favorite financial website right 
now. The 2 years has a higher interest 
rate than the 10 year. The 5 years has 
a higher interest rate than a 10 year. 
The 7 year has a higher interest rate 
than the 10 year. That is the markets 
telling you that they expect inflation 
to be with us for years. 
You also saw in the inflation report 
we received last week, you saw my 
brothers and sisters on the left: Hey, 
energy prices are down—yay. Oh, why 
is the core inflation so high? 
Congratulations, you did it. Func-
tionally, 30 years of substantial sta-
bility in inflation, and we got ourselves 
a wage-price spiral. We dumped, in 
March 2001, so much money into the 
economy that it set off what is called a 
wage-price spiral. Wages go up; you 
have to raise your prices. Well, if you 
raise your prices, you have to pay your 
workers more. If you pay your workers 
more, you have to raise your prices. 
What happens when that becomes 
embedded into the structure of the 
economy and energy goes up and down? 
And how many of our friends on the 
left keep saying, ‘‘Well, it is Ukraine’’? 
Of course, if you remove energy prices, 
you still have inflation built into the 
core. 
b 1515 
This is really, really horrible, dan-
gerous, and brutal. 
Does anyone here give a damn about 
poor people? 
Does anyone here care about the 
working middle class? 
Does anyone care about people trying 
to retire? 
Mr. Speaker, you have got to under-
stand the brutality. 
Because where does that money go? 
I am going to show some boards here. 
I 
represent 
the 
Phoenix-Scottsdale 
area. I have the highest inflation in the 
continental United States. I am still 
trying to figure out why Alaska has an 
urban zone that is higher than mine. 
But functionally I have the highest in-
flation in the country. 
If you live and work in my commu-
nity and did not have a pay hike—I am 
going to show it, and you are going to 
hear this multiple times—you now 
work for a month and a half for free, 
Mr. Speaker. 
This place functionally taxed you. 
One month and a half of your labor has 
been stripped from you. And the money 
doesn’t disappear. What happens is 
your wages become worth less pur-
chasing, but that wealth transfer from 
you, Mr. Speaker, is actually a form of 
tax because the $30 trillion over here of 
borrowed money your government has, 
actually now it gets to be paid back 
with dollars of less value. 
Whether you know it or not, Mr. 
Speaker, if you are my neighbor in the 
Phoenix-Scottsdale 
area, 
you 
have 
been taxed out of a month and a half of 
your wages. And thank you. You helped 
to actually buy down the U.S. debt be-
cause borrowers benefit from inflation, 
but people trying to save, people get-
ting ready to buy a home, getting 
ready for retirement, and people just 
trying to survive get crushed. 
So if you had listened to the floor the 
last couple of days, Mr. Speaker, how 
many times have you had someone 
come to this floor and actually show 
they even care? 
No. We will give some great speeches 
about: Hey, 50 illegal crossers of our 
border got shipped to Martha’s Vine-
yard. Ooh. 
Come to my State. That is like every 
few minutes. I am a border State. Come 
down to Yuma with me, Mr. Speaker, 
and let me show you what the hell is 
actually going on. 
But in Washington, D.C., I am still 
waiting for my brothers and sisters on 
the left to come behind these micro-
phones and apologize for, functionally, 
what is the biggest tax in U.S. history. 
We are now rivaling what happened to 
this country in the late seventies and 
very early eighties, except the crisis is 
much more complex now. 
Here is why: Yes, you had the wage 
spirals, the price spirals, and the fuel 
spirals of the late seventies, but we had 
a beneficial demographic. We had lots 
of available workers. 
Today, we have this crazy thing 
going on where our available work pop-
ulation because of our demographics— 
my fear is the Federal Reserve is going 
to have to break the back of employ-
ment in this country to squeeze out in-
flation. 
Are we all ready for that? 
Because we Republicans in this legis-
lature and in this Congress have come 
behind these mikes multiple times—I 
have introduced legislation and said, 
Look, what is inflation? 
Inflation is too many dollars chasing 
too few goods. 
You can do one of two things. You 
can squeeze the dollars out of society 
so all that free money the Democrats 
gave away over the last couple years 
will raise interest rates, pull liquidity 
out, and take it away; or we could 
make more stuff. 
I am going to show a couple of boards 
here of what has happened to produc-
tivity in the last couple of quarters. We 
are crashing. Our productivity is crash-
ing. So when you do the fancy math, 
Mr. Speaker, and you are not making 
more stuff, it means what the Federal 
Reserve is going to have to do to us is 
more and more brutal. And I think ac-
tually some of the markets are actu-
ally starting to wake up the last couple 
of days and are starting to understand 
the malfeasance, the economic malfea-
sance, of this place. 
But then again, I sometimes wonder: 
Do I work with a bunch of people who 
don’t own a calculator or didn’t show 
up to their high school economics 
class? 
Because this isn’t that complicated. 
We use big, fancy words. We do bril-
liant virtue signaling. But the math is 
brutal, and I think we need to wake up 
when we saw what the President did, 
what was it, on ‘‘60 Minutes’’ a couple 
of days ago. It was a complete dis-
connect from what is happening to the 
middle class and the poor going on in 
this country. 
So let’s actually use a few boards 
here just to try to provide some tex-
tual facts to how this all works.

September 20, 2022 
Now, I am just trying to make a 
point, and this is for myself. I rep-
resent the Phoenix-Scottsdale area. 
Now we have the highest inflation in 
the Nation. So maybe if you are in a 
community that, hey, you only had 7 
percent, my folks are breaking 13. 
Try being a working family that is 
trying to survive in a world where your 
purchasing power lost 13 percent and 
your rents are still going up. Rents are 
eventually going to come down when 
the Federal Reserve has started to 
break the back of employment. That 
may be as much as 18 months away. We 
are finally starting to see our home 
prices start to tip a bit because a 
Firstrust first mortgage these days is 
now well over 6 percent if it is a con-
forming loan. 
But it is fascinating. It is also the 
communities that have had some of the 
greatest economic prosperity because 
there are people moving there who also 
seem to be suffering the highest infla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, let us start to actually 
look at some of the drivers. This is 
July 21 to July 22. 
Okay, energy, hey, it is 2.7 percent of 
that inflation. But start to add in shel-
ter, start to add in energy, and start to 
add in—and come back up here and all 
the other things, and this is the stuff 
right here, this, this, and food, just 
skip the energy portion, and that is 
how we are making the argument. You 
saw it in the CPI data this last week. It 
is now structural. It is now structural. 
At some point, if I lose my mind, I 
am going to talk about what happens 
now that the U.S. dollar is going up. 
Remember, why is the U.S. dollar 
now starting to go up? 
I know we are geeking out. 
Our interest rates are going up. If 
you are in a country over here, you can 
say, Hey, I can put money into a U.S. 
dollar-denominated bond and get this 
high interest rate. I am going to pull 
my money out of this country and put 
it over here. 
Okay. So now there is a hunger to 
convert to dollars raising the value of 
the dollar. 
Okay. Do you understand we are now 
exporting our inflation around the 
world? So the crappy economics this 
place did, now you are kicking the rest 
of the world’s head in. 
So we also talk about how much we 
care about the poor and how much we 
care about the poor around the world. 
Does anyone understand here when 
we blow up our own economics, we ex-
port our bad policy? 
It is very much like when we did the 
tax reform at the very end of 2017, be-
cause we did so many things right and 
boosted economic growth so substan-
tially and GDP growth, and we lowered 
income inequality and all these good 
things were happening here in the 
United States, the World Bank actu-
ally raised worldwide GDP projections 
because when we got our economics 
right, the rest of the world actually got 
less poor. 
Well, now you are seeing the other 
side of the coin, Mr. Speaker. When we 
get our economics wrong, we also ex-
port misery. 
Mr. Speaker, some of these charts 
you have all seen before. I have had 
them here on the floor, and it is just 
basically trying to show what has hap-
pened. Just look at this line here. This 
is functionally what is happening to 
your ability to afford things. And you 
will notice it happened, functionally, 
almost the day this place had unified 
leftist control, when the Democrats 
took control of the White House, al-
ready had control of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives, and they 
pushed through their policies. You can 
almost see, hey, policies change, and, 
yes, look at the time of the pandemic, 
but at least when it came to your pur-
chasing power and your ability to sur-
vive, it was fairly stable. 
This line coming down here, do you 
see that collapse? 
That is thanks to you for Democrat 
policies. 
We have been trying it. If anyone has 
a suggestion on a better way we could 
do this, I am trying to visually come 
up with some way because we are often 
engaged in sort of a malpractice here. 
We use big, fancy words. We talk 
about, well, I have 13 percent inflation 
in my Phoenix market. 
I have been trying to find a way to 
describe what that actually means to a 
working family. So that is where we 
came up with this concept of saying: 
Do you realize how many days of your 
labor you have lost? 
And then we have tried doing it 
where you also adjust it for what the 
gasoline prices are. 
How many days of labor do you lose 
for higher gasoline prices? 
If anyone has a suggestion how 
graphically we can sort of show, here is 
the labor you lost just because of high-
er fuel prices. But here is the labor you 
lost just because of what has happened. 
In my area it is air-conditioning 
prices. In your area, Mr. Speaker, it 
might be heating. We are going to have 
a fun winter for those of you who don’t 
live in the desert. 
But also our core inflation, we have 
been trying to do things like show a 
calendar. 
Is there another way you can help 
the American people understand the 
stress they are feeling? 
What is the old saying? 
There is a lot more month left in-
stead of cash at the end of the month? 
It is real, and it is pervasive. 
There also needs to be an under-
standing. The inflation that this place 
set off this last year will be part of our 
economics for a decade or two. 
So, Mr. Speaker, if you are the per-
son thinking about retiring a decade 
from now, I sure hope you are re-look-
ing at everything you need and how 
many dollars you have to set aside. 
What is your housing? What is your 
healthcare? 
Because you have got to also under-
stand there are some inputs here. So 
let’s say the mean inflation in the 
country is 8, 9 percent. Healthcare in 
the country is functionally running 
double that. 
Mr. Speaker, are you ready to have 
your copay on your future healthcare 
be doubled what it is today? 
Because that is what is coming at 
you. So, yes, the Democrats have 
pushed a subsidy bill on drug prices, 
but that doesn’t cover the fact that in-
flation is about to come and kick your 
head in. And, once again, it is also 
reaching into the general fund, putting 
it over here. We are going to borrow 
the money; we are going to try to find 
some way to tax it from you or tax it 
from my kids. 
You know the world has changed, Mr. 
Speaker. Let’s see if I can actually find 
some of these to make it a little easier. 
But you start to realize when even 
the left-wing talking head Democrat 
apologists who hold economics degrees 
are basically standing up and talking 
about the misery the Democrat policies 
have brought to this country. 
So let’s see. We have Jason Furman. 
How many of us have ever seen Jason 
Furman say a single nice thing about a 
Republican? 
Of course not. He basically makes his 
living berating those of us on the right 
and basically defending Democrat poli-
cies. 
The math has gotten so ugly he can 
no longer defend what Democrats have 
done to people in this country. The me-
dium CPI excludes all of the large 
changes in either direction and is a 
better predictor of labor market slack. 
Now, this is important, where I’m 
trying to get here. Jason Furman is ba-
sically trying to help us understand 
that we are busting through a 9.5 per-
cent annual rate in August, which is 
the single highest monthly print in the 
datasets which started in 1983. I don’t 
mean this to be disjointed. I want it to 
sort of become crisp. The core of infla-
tion is functionally higher than any 
time it has been published since 1983. 
Mr. Speaker, how old were you in 
1983? 
Do you remember the level of mis-
ery? 
Congratulations. This is what the 
policies around this place did. 
And then you get a clown who says, 
Oh, it is Ukraine. It is this and that. 
No, it is not. This stuff was in the fu-
tures market long before. 
Mr. Speaker, do you remember a year 
ago September when the futures mar-
kets in energies and those things were 
blowing off the charts? 
That was telling you this was com-
ing. 
But that would require some eco-
nomic literacy. 
Look, I accept some of this is 
geeking out when you start to try to do 
CPI and core CPI. 
The simple point of a chart like this 
is it is not like, hey, we had this huge 
fluctuation of fuel prices, but every-
thing else was fairly normal. 
Sorry. It is not.

This is my Phoenix area. 
b 1530 
When you start to realize that my 
folks are living with over 13 percent, it 
might be a reason why a lot of us from 
the West are incredibly cranky because 
we are just now getting the announce-
ments of how much our electricity is 
going to be going up. 
For the rest of you in the country— 
you know, we are about to hit our love-
ly time of the year when the tempera-
ture comes down, and we are not run-
ning our air conditioners. You are all 
getting ready to turn on your heat. 
Have all of you in the colder States, 
have you started to budget your money 
for what is about to hit you in your 
heating bills? For my brothers and sis-
ters on the left, you better hope that it 
doesn’t get cold before the election day 
before your folks start to see their 
power bills. 
Just sort of making the point—food 
prices continue to increase with food at 
home having the largest annual in-
crease since the end of the 1970s. I was 
in high school in the late 1970s—I am 
willing to admit it—and fashion was 
pretty 
horrible 
and 
inflation 
was 
worse. 
I remember watching my President 
get up on television, wearing a sweater, 
explaining that we were going to have 
to live poorer. I remember this old guy 
running for President, who was actu-
ally optimistic, saying, hey, if we open 
up our reserves and natural gas and 
those things, we will live better. 
That was also one of the great ironies 
that I think the oldest candidate run-
ning for President, Ronald Reagan, had 
the biggest portion of young people 
voting for him. It was because of opti-
mism. 
I desperately want to get behind this 
microphone 
and 
demonstrate 
opti-
mism. I have a 7-year-old and an 11- 
week-old—at my age—that is being 
pathologically optimistic. I want my 
little boy and my little girl to have an 
amazing American life. The American 
dream is not some sort of piece of rhet-
oric to me, it is what we are struc-
turally; it is a gift we are given. The 
math is horrendous. 
My 11-week-old son—that just came 
to us as a surprise—in 30 years, he is 
entering sort of the beginning of his 
peak earning years, and the United 
States will have—on today’s dollars 
and today’s math, without inflation 
calculated in it—this is from CBO a 
couple weeks ago, and they had not put 
long-term inflation into the math—$128 
trillion of borrowed money in today’s 
dollars. That is $128 trillion borrowed 
money in today’s dollars. 
So, of course, this place is fixated on 
how we are going to save that next 
generation and how we are going to 
create economic prosperity and eco-
nomic growth because growth is moral. 
Oh, sorry, I take that back. It is 
moral to some of us. Control, power, 
voting out $4 trillion of borrowing 
since this White House and since this 
unified Democrat government—with a 
stunning amount of that money being 
transferred in subsidies to people that 
vote for them—and they don’t dem-
onstrate even a hoot of caring for sur-
vival of people who are going to be in 
retirement. And for these young peo-
ple, that is another Congress’ problem. 
If this place had a soul, we would be 
fixated day after day on what we are 
going to do to make more stuff to bend 
inflation 
so 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
doesn’t have to break the back of peo-
ple’s lives. Of a future where instead of 
having the debate of—hey, ObamaCare, 
let’s subsidize things more, the Repub-
lican alternative, which was also a sub-
sidy bill. Screw that. 
Why don’t we do something that is 
rational? Maybe we should change the 
price of healthcare, adopt technology, 
cure things. Look, I have done dozens 
of presentations here on the economics 
of cures, the economics of technology 
disruptions 
in 
healthcare. 
Yes, 
it 
means you have to say ‘‘no’’ to armies 
of lobbyists. 
It is also the only mathematical way 
I can find you save this place, save this 
country, save this experiment, save lit-
tle boy’s economic future, my little 
girl’s future. We are not going to do it, 
because it doesn’t hand huge amounts 
of power and control to the left. 
It is not a check from government to 
someone that is going to turn around 
and write one political party a check. 
It is that cynical. What do we do? We 
are going to watch cable television for 
a couple days, complain about 50 mi-
grants who illegally crossed into the 
country showing up in Martha’s Vine-
yard because that is easy to under-
stand and it is good television. 
The same day—you got how much 
poorer that day because of inflation. 
You got that much closer to Social Se-
curity having no money left in the 
trust fund. That $128 trillion I just 
mentioned to you, every dime from the 
$30 trillion borrowing we are at today 
to the $128 trillion—the model says 
every dime of that increased bor-
rowing—75 percent is Medicare, 25 per-
cent is Social Security, and the rest of 
the budget is in balance. 
Okay. The problem is right in front 
of us. Let’s do something bold and fix 
Social Security. Except the Social Se-
curity proposals around her are absurd. 
There are some things we can do where 
you don’t do taxes in a mechanism 
where you actually slow the economy 
down, and therefore, lose much of the 
economic growth you were trying to fix 
to be able to have revenues in FICA. 
Then the revolution I have talked 
about so many times here on the floor 
of disruption of cure diseases. I don’t 
mean this to sound like a non sequitur, 
but it ties in. Diabetes is basically a 
third of all healthcare spending. Type 2 
is really complex, some genetic, a lot 
of it lifestyle, but we help fund it 
through how we do the farm bill and 
other things. 
We know there has been a break-
through, it is only like a half a dozen 
people, and it is very short-term, so we 
don’t have the longer latitudinal data, 
who have been cured of type 1. 
Think about the hundreds of billions 
of dollars this place basically was 
handing out—that we all know we are 
going to be here a year or two from 
now holding hearings on how much was 
stolen, wasted, handed out to political 
cronies, and favoritism. Could you 
imagine if we took a fraction of those 
dollars, and said: Well, diabetes is 31 
percent of all Medicare spending, it is 
33 percent of all healthcare spending, 
maybe having the revolution of a cure 
there—really hard. 
Oh, by the way, it is also the single 
biggest thing you can do for U.S. sov-
ereign debt and the future economic 
growth of the country. It turns out 
when we look at poverty—the number 
of our brothers and sisters who are 
really below the poverty line—I have 
some Members hear that say, oh, it is 
racism. Oh, it is education. 
It turns out health may be the num-
ber one component. Grandma just had 
her foot cut off because of diabetes. 
What does that do to the entire family 
structure’s ability to participate in the 
economy? Maybe the moral discus-
sion—I represent a Tribal community 
that has the second highest per capita 
diabetes in the world. Number one is 
right down the street; it is the sister 
Tribe. 
If you actually cared—having the dis-
ruptive conversation of, screw it, we 
are going to find a way to have this 
health revolution because it is great 
economics. It is also moral. It is com-
passionate. It is loving. And saying 
that we are going to build one more 
clinic—we are going to build more clin-
ics. That is compassion? We are going 
to help teach you how to live with your 
misery when there is a path for a cure? 
It is just that optimism that should 
be part of the ethos of what we are. 
Maybe it doesn’t raise us political 
money. Maybe it is not good cam-
paigns. Maybe it is beyond our intellec-
tual comprehension around here. God 
knows, the intellectual gravitas of this 
place has just almost become trite 
when you hear the debates and discus-
sions we have on the floor. 
The economics are sound. The com-
passion is noble. And it is actually the 
right thing to do. Yet, I can’t tell you— 
I have been doing this for a few years 
now—the poor staff here who has had 
to listen to these speeches and watch 
me hold up these boards and then try 
to scribe it down—which I apologize 
when I do the machine gun talking. 
There is a path here. I am trying to 
find a couple of the slides that are just 
terrifying me right now. I accept the 
media—excuse me, the Democrat prop-
agandas—media, 
same 
thing—don’t 
want to talk about inflation and what 
it does to people. Don’t want to talk to 
what it does to retirees and young cou-
ples and those things because it is not 
going to help their friends win. 
But maybe understanding it—maybe 
actually having it be written about in

September 20, 2022 
a moral aspect, a moral discussion of 
what we are doing to working families 
in this country might actually get 
some of us off our heinies to come here 
and do things, saying, hey, you do real-
ize there is policy we can engage in. 
Naming a piece of legislation the In-
flation Reduction Act, when it does no 
such thing. When it comes back being 
scored as, hey, you know, several years 
from now it is still borrowing money. 
The way the Democrats were scoring, 
saying, well, we get inflation reduction 
by taxing people and yanking money 
out of the economy by lowering pro-
ductivity and taking their money 
away. Oh, by the way, all the savings 
ended in the future years, and it is all 
gimmicks. 
That is not me talking. That is actu-
ally liberal groups that were scoring 
the bill that were outraged on the fake 
economics. You start looking at this 
growing divergence, the split of infla-
tion in metro areas and other parts of 
the country. 
San Francisco where you now have 
people abandoning it has only about 5.7 
percent inflation. Where they are com-
ing to, places like my community, I am 
busting through 13. Can you see why 
I’m concerned? 
I am looking for a chart. My fear is 
I don’t have it here, it may be in the 
piles over there. 
There was data out about 10 days ago 
talking about productivity. Now who 
knows what productivity is? 
Okay. The way they do the model, 
you know, the people that score this, 
they basically say, hey, we have this 
many 
workers 
and 
those 
workers 
produce this many units of production. 
Okay. And we have been doing this 
modeling for a very long time. It is 
really good for the economy when a 
worker actually produces more every 
day than they did the day before. That 
is not just because, hey, they made the 
production line go faster, it is because 
we got the tax code, right, so they did 
investments. 
One of the amazing things that hap-
pened after the 2017 tax reform is we 
did something called expensing it. Now, 
part of that expensing you actually got 
to take—I am going to geek out—the 
last quarter of 2017. So that is why 
there is this sudden lift in the end of 
2017, even before the tax reform was 
done because we did something retro-
spectively. 
Then the next couple years, boom, 
you saw all this capital coming back in 
from the rest of the world because we 
fixed the international repatriation in-
centives to bring money back to the 
country. Then we said, if you go buy a 
piece of equipment that will make you 
faster, better, cleaner, more produc-
tive, we are going to let you—instead 
of depreciating it over the next decade, 
we are going to let you take it on day 
one. 
Yes, we take a big hit today on tax 
receipts, 
but—eventually 
that 
was 
going to happen on the tax receipts, it 
just happens over a longer time, but we 
take it today—here is the catch, we get 
a sudden pop of productivity. So there 
is more economic activity and that 
new step up in activity means we get 
more tax revenues in the next couple 
years. 
b 1545 
Guess what happened in speech after 
speech of our brothers and sisters on 
the left? This is a giveaway to the rich. 
It is a giveaway to the big corpora-
tions. I have quotes from a half dozen 
Members, senior Democrat Members 
here, who told us we were going to go 
into depression because of what the Re-
publicans did in tax reform. 
Guess what happened? Within a year, 
the poor started getting less poor. The 
middle class got much more pros-
perous. Income inequality started to 
shrink. Food insecurity shrank. Cor-
porate tax receipts grew. 
How is that possible? Because it 
turns out that getting the tax and reg-
ulatory code meant investment in 
things that made us more productive. 
When you make society more produc-
tive, what are the two ways you get 
paid more? Inflation, which just means 
you are getting compensated for really 
bad public policy. The dollar is worth 
less, so we are going to pay you more 
so you just hold even. When your pay-
check goes up for inflation, you didn’t 
gain anything. 
The other thing economics tells you 
is you pay people more because they 
are being more productive, and that 
productivity is absolutely necessary if 
we are going to survive our demo-
graphic curve, if we are going to make 
our promises on Social Security and 
Medicare. 
You have to understand that all this 
has to work together. You have to do 
everything from immigration policy to 
environmental policy to tax policy to 
regulatory policy. You have to get all 
these things right. Instead, we are 
going just to do the try it around here, 
and we are going to do great virtue sig-
naling. 
Why this board is important is the 
quarters now where we are starting to 
see Democrat policy kick in, we are 
having an absolute crash of produc-
tivity. So, you are saying, but we have 
all these people working. Okay, but the 
math is the math. 
They may be working, but something 
is going on out there. Maybe this is the 
phasing out of the expensing, which 
was part of tax reform. Some on our 
side are trying to make it permanent; 
Democrats oppose it. But this is really 
bad. You need this to look very dif-
ferent. 
Even if you just cared about infla-
tion, productivity is one of your cures. 
If you get someone here who says Con-
gress doesn’t have influence, this is 
about monetary supply, and it is the 
Federal Reserve, yes, it is. 
My argument is when we pump out 
spending that is going to require bor-
rowing, and the Federal Reserve basi-
cally acts like our daddy who indem-
nifies us from really stupid policy and 
buys up our debt, we are functionally 
creating monetary policy by our prof-
ligate spending. 
Instead of putting those dollars into 
things 
that 
change 
productivity, 
change people’s ability to survive and 
have wealth and economically grow 
and, 
therefore, 
bend 
the 
inflation 
curve, we did just the opposite. We 
handed out money at one point to en-
courage people to stay home. 
Somewhere here I think I have the 
Larry Summers chart. Remember a 
couple of years ago, Larry Summers 
was, like, an absolute hero of the left, 
great academics, well spoken, well re-
spected, and then he made the sin of 
saying: Please don’t do this. Dumping 
another $1.9 trillion on the economy 
when you are not asking people to ei-
ther step up their skills or actually 
participate in the economy, please 
don’t do this. 
All of a sudden, the left, as they do 
because he didn’t engage in sort of the 
theater of virtue signaling, turned on 
him. Oh, he is evil. He is bad. Well, it 
turns out, he was right. 
The amount of misery these crappy 
economics have created to people in 
this country, the number of people who 
are poorer—one of the projects we are 
working on in our office is, in a decade, 
the Social Security trust fund runs out 
of money, 121⁄2 years. We haven’t cal-
culated in the inflationary cycle yet. 
That wasn’t part of the trustees’ re-
port. 
Let’s say this place continues to do 
what it does, which is nothing, and we 
don’t fix it. With the cost of everything 
being higher, even though you have the 
Social Security COLAs, you have to 
still pay your healthcare copays, which 
are inflation doubled, at double the 
rate. You may be heading toward dou-
bling the number of senior Americans 
who are in poverty. 
The number of Members here who are 
getting behind the microphone and 
saying, ‘‘Oh, this is just transitory. It 
is Putin’s tax hike. It is the evil oil 
companies.’’ No. It is crappy policy. 
Larry Summers and others told you it 
was. They told you this was coming. 
You are trying to continue to virtue 
signal or blame other people. 
Madam Speaker, may I ask how 
much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
LEGER FERNANDEZ). The gentleman has 
20 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I will do my very 
best not to use up that time. 
I am not even sure I should do this 
one to all of you. We will come back to 
that previous one and see if we can 
make it make more sense. 
Let’s see. The left has been in control 
here for, what are we, about 18 months? 
Since President Biden was sworn in, off 
the top of your head, before looking at 
the slide, how much has been added to 
the deficit? Under unified Democrat 
control, how much have we borrowed? 
Remember, you have a President who 
almost gleefully gets behind a micro-
phone and says, I have lowered. Well,

September 20, 2022 
that is because some of the borrowing 
during the pandemic was insane. We 
borrowed $4.8 trillion, and here are 
some of the things: the rescue plan, the 
omnibus, you know. 
You start to add in just the growth of 
spending, and then what is fascinating 
is we are now finally starting to see 
some of these charts that have inter-
est. It is one of the reasons I wanted to 
touch on that. 
You do realize our borrowing costs 
today have almost doubled. Actually, I 
think they have more than doubled 
since the day President Biden was 
sworn in. 
There is a model out there that says 
if you had a 2-point higher interest 
rate on U.S. sovereign debt over—func-
tionally, I think the model was 25 
years, 2 points higher. We are 2-plus 
points higher right now. But if that 
were to be sustained for about 25 years, 
at the end of that 25 years, every dime 
of tax receipts from this government 
pays nothing but interest. 
Now, back to the slide where I was 
fixated on productivity and economic 
growth. Are you getting the pitch? If 
we would stop the clown show and start 
to fixate on things that help people— 
and is helping people really Republican 
or Democrat, because this place isn’t 
doing it. We subsidize people. We sure 
hand out a hell of a lot of checks, but 
almost none of that makes society 
healthier and more productive. 
There is a path. When you start to 
see things like this and realize when we 
factor in the new interest rates, the 
amount of just the financing, just the 
financing on $4.8 trillion of additional 
borrowing we have done in—what?—the 
last 18 months, when the 2 year today 
was in—what?—3 and a half, still going 
up. 
Why isn’t there a sense of worry 
around here? I mean, you all walk 
around with these cell phones. You 
know, there are calculators on them. 
This was just an attempt—and I 
know the slide is noisy. We were just 
trying to work in the components of 
GDPNow. Let’s see if I can make this 
make sense. 
If you are crazy enough to have been 
watching this, there is an app you can 
go to right now and download it from 
the Atlanta Federal Reserve. It is 
called GDPNow. 
What they try to do is take datasets 
as they come out, and it is a formula. 
It is pure math. This isn’t like the New 
York Fed, which actually does attitu-
dinal things and sort of purchasing at-
titudes and savings attitudes. GDPNow 
is just cold, hard math. 
This was an attempt to try to show, 
hey, here are some of the components. 
GDPNow is a real GDP calculator. 
What is going on, because as you know, 
GDP in the first quarter came in nega-
tive, but there were genuinely some 
timing and some energy effects on that 
one. 
But GDPNow in the second quarter 
came in negative, and that one was— 
well, it looks like it is structural. As of 
about 2 hours ago, the GDPNow web 
app you can put on your phone—a cou-
ple of weeks ago, they thought this 
quarter was going to be about a 21⁄2 per-
cent growth rate, which would have 
been nice. It sort of meant, hey, the 
fall of economic expansion looks like it 
had bent and was coming back up. 
As of a couple of hours ago, now it 
has fallen all the way down to 0.3 with 
negative bias, meaning these inputs 
that the Atlanta Fed is using continue 
to fall. 
I am going to predict we are heading 
into a third negative GDP quarter. 
Now, are we going to have the same 
argument that we had last quarter? 
Well, technically, two negative quar-
ters is not a recession. Technically, we 
have this little committee over here, 
and they decide if it is a recession. So, 
we spent a week trying to decide: 
Should we call it a recession? Should 
we say we are not in a recession? 
My attitude was: Who cares? How 
about we do something that would be 
much more compassionate? Let’s go 
talk to the family down the street that 
is just trying to survive and ask them 
how they are doing. 
I am going to get up here and geek 
out on the components that actually 
go into a GDP calculator. My real re-
quest is this place functionally start to 
understand the crappy policies we have 
made the last 18 months. 
We can reverse course. We can do 
things policy-wise that get economic 
growth, get productivity, produce hy-
drocarbons, produce the things that are 
components for prosperity, or we can 
continue to functionally export misery, 
not only throughout our country but 
throughout the world, because that is 
what we have done. 
Be prepared. In a couple of weeks, 
you are going to find out we have had 
another quarter of negative growth. We 
are going to have the press and the 
Democrats say: Oh, but that is not a 
real definition of recession. That is a 
committee over here. Let’s talk about 
migrants being shipped to, you know. 
Instead, we will do everything we can 
to understand the scale of the eco-
nomic dislocations that policy around 
here has done in the last year and a 
half. 
Understand, 
Republicans: 
We 
are 
going to take the majority of this 
House this November. My math, from 
what I can see policy-wise, even if we 
controlled everything, it is going to 
take years to fix. 
Remember the opening here? I tried 
to explain something, and that was 
called the yield curve. When you have 
an inverted yield curve, what does it 
mean? It is not that complicated. 
My 2-year T bill, I give you money to 
hold a 2-year Treasury bond, full faith 
and credit of you, the taxpayers, or a 5 
year, a 7 year. All those are paying 
higher interest rates than if you 
bought a 10 year. 
That lets you know the markets now 
believe inflation is here for years and 
years. The data on these boards now 
says inflation is here for years and 
years. 
How much policy do you see coming 
from our brothers and sisters in the 
majority 
demonstrating 
they 
care 
enough to actually take on the misery, 
or are we just going to engage in the 
political theater, the virtue signaling, 
to survive the next election cycle? 
Madam Speaker pro tempore, I apolo-
gize for the discombobulation of not 
having the boards set up. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ABORTION ACCESS IN THE 
MILITARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. SPEIER) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material during 
this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
this afternoon to hold this Special 
Order on a very important issue. It is 
an issue about abortion access in the 
military. I thank my colleagues for 
joining me and elevating their voices 
on the experience of our troops who are 
terrified that they will be stationed in 
a State where they cannot control 
their bodies. 
The Supreme Court decision in Dobbs 
overturned 50 years of precedent recog-
nizing the constitutional right to abor-
tion. The Court stated that their opin-
ion merely returned the issue of abor-
tion rights to the States, and that 
women can vote for whom they wish to 
represent their values. 
But servicemembers don’t have that 
right. They don’t get to choose where 
they live. This leaves 230,000 service-
women who could be ordered to a State 
that forces them to stay pregnant, 
even under circumstances where they 
have been raped, because that is what 
some of the States in this grand Union 
have decided is the law of the land in 
their State. 
Let me tell you that this is going to 
have profound impacts on the issues 
that really are of great concern to us 
who oversee the military right now. 
Recruitment is down. Retention is a 
problem, and readiness is a problem. 
That is only going to be exacerbated by 
having a situation where these service-
women who become pregnant are going 
to have to travel long distances to get 
an abortion. 
Access to abortion has long been a 
struggle for women in the military, es-
pecially those overseas and our junior

September 20, 2022 
enlisted with lower incomes. The Dobbs 
decision has just made matters worse. 
This map right here shows all the 
States in red that have basically pro-
hibited abortions, for all intents and 
purposes. 
Now, one in four women will have an 
abortion some time during their repro-
ductive years. We now look at the fact 
that women in the military have a 22 
percent higher incidence of unintended 
pregnancies than women who are in the 
civilian world. 
So now let’s look at this. There are 
actually 128 military installations in 
these red States. Of those 128 installa-
tions that will prohibit abortion, 80,000 
servicewomen are on bases in those 
States. The vast majority of those 
women are of childbearing age. 
Now, the Rand study that was re-
cently commissioned estimated that 
there are 4,000 servicewomen every 
year that are getting abortions. Now, 
of those 4,000 women who will get abor-
tions, 40 percent of them are in States 
that have severely restricted or no ac-
cess to abortion. 
Now, look at this. You have a situa-
tion, where you are in Louisiana or 
Mississippi, look how far you are going 
to have to travel, how many States you 
are going to have to travel through to 
get to a blue State where you could ac-
cess an abortion. 
Privates in the military make about 
$2,000 a month. Most of the abortions 
will happen to young servicemembers. 
A typical cost, not including travel, to 
get the medication abortion is $568. To 
have a first-trimester, procedural abor-
tion it is $625. And a second-trimester 
abortion is $775. 
For a servicemember who must trav-
el for an abortion, for example, from 
the State of Texas to Kansas, let’s say, 
with a two-night stay in a hotel, the 
expected cost is $1,100 or more. That is 
almost half of the monthly salary for a 
typical junior enlisted servicemember. 
In July, we had the very first hearing 
ever in the House Armed Services Com-
mittee on abortion access. Two coura-
geous Active-Duty women who have 
served in the military, each for over 20 
years. So, they have excelled, they are 
officers in the military, or noncommis-
sioned officers in the military, and 
they have been so good that they have 
been retained in the military and pro-
moted. 
Let me tell you their stories. Theresa 
spoke of how her abortion as a junior 
enlisted servicemember enabled her 20- 
year career in the Air Force. She used 
her entire paycheck to cover the cost 
of the abortion, and her next paycheck 
to reimburse her friend for the gas 
money for driving her to the facility. 
Another servicemember, whose name 
is Sharon, spoke of getting an abortion 
because she wasn’t ready to have an-
other child. 
Let’s remember that 59 percent of the 
women who get abortions in this coun-
try are already mothers. I was one of 
them. 
She and her partner were going to 
drive to Georgia, but then they learned 
it had a mandatory waiting-period law. 
So then they ended up traveling all the 
way to New York City; and she credits 
that abortion for her 24 years of Active 
Duty in the military. 
Now, I have more to say, but I am 
going to yield now to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL), my 
great colleague, who is one of the co- 
chairs of the Democratic Women’s Cau-
cus. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman SPEIER for yielding, and for her 
great leadership on this issue and so 
many that affect our women in the 
military. 
I also want to start with a shout out 
to Congressman TAKANO and Congress-
woman BROWNLEY for their work on 
getting veterans the healthcare they 
need. 
Madam Speaker, I join Congress-
woman SPEIER and millions of Ameri-
cans who believe that a woman should 
be able to make her own decision about 
her reproductive care, her life, and her 
future. And here is the thing: Abortion 
is healthcare, and the decision to seek 
an abortion is deeply personal. It is a 
decision that should be made by a 
woman with her doctor, or with people 
she trusts, not by politicians, not by 
the Governors, not by a State legisla-
ture, people who have no insight into 
her circumstance. 
Today, we are taking the opportunity 
to focus on the importance of reproduc-
tive freedom for members of our mili-
tary. 
I believe, as the gentlewoman pointed 
out, there are over 200,000 Active-Duty 
women servicemembers that serve our 
Nation, 80,000 residing in the over 100 
military bases in this country; bases 
dominated by men. Most of these 
women are young; they are fresh out of 
high school or college; they have never 
been away from home, and they have 
hopes and dreams, and they are filled 
with pride and excitement. Sadly, they 
are entering an environment where 
sexual assault is rampant. 
Just ask Sarah, who was stationed at 
Fort Hood, Texas. This was just a few 
years ago. She was raped at a party at-
tended by military personnel. At that 
point, in those days, she was able to 
opt for an abortion, and she was able to 
drive. She had been at Fort Hood, 
Texas, and she was able to drive to a 
Planned Parenthood nearby. 
But now that the Republican-con-
trolled Supreme Court has made a das-
tardly—that is sort of a polite way to 
express it—dastardly decision to re-
strict access to abortion, what would 
be the option for Sarah, or any of the 
women stationed on American bases 
where the States have either banned or 
restricted abortion? 
I have a similar map to the one Rep-
resentative SPEIER showed. So the dark 
color—where there are dark colors on 
the State, I will call it red. I am going 
to call it ‘‘magna’’ red, the ‘‘magna’’ 
red States. And those are States that 
either have banned, or are restricting, 
or severely restricting, or in the proc-
ess of restricting access to abortion. 
There are about 27 of those in this 
country. 
Take a look. Those little dots, black 
dots, they represent the military bases 
in this country. Just take a look. 
I am going to have to, Madam Speak-
er, move to my map. What if you are in 
a base—if you were based deep in 
Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, even in 
Florida, where do you go? Where do 
you go? The map tells the story. 
So we know that Sarah would have 
had to drive 9 hours, 9 hours from Fort 
Hood, just to get to New Mexico. 
Make no mistake, Madam Speaker. 
Make no mistake, that the Republican- 
appointed 
Supreme 
Court, 
the 
‘‘magna’’ 
Republican 
State 
legisla-
tures, have declared a war on women. 
So here we are today saying this: Our 
patriotic women, they leave their 
homes, their family, and their friends, 
to serve our country. They signed up to 
be pilots and engineers and medics, not 
to have a forced pregnancy forced by 
‘‘magna’’ Republicans. 
We trust them with Black Hawks, 
with firearms, logistics. We must trust 
them to make their own medical deci-
sions about their lives and give them 
access to the healthcare they deserve. 
They are standing up for our free-
dom, and we must stand up for theirs. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her power-
ful comments. 
On top of everything else, we passed 
one law which was the Hyde amend-
ment, that said you can’t use Federal 
funds for medical abortions, so Med-
icaid was not made available for that 
purpose. But many States have decided 
to cover it anyway. 
But that wasn’t enough for the Con-
gresses some years ago. They decided 
that we would ban any abortion at a 
military treatment facility except for 
rape, incest, and the life of the mother. 
So that means a servicemember can’t 
go to the military treatment facility 
on their base, get the abortion, and pay 
for it themselves. We make them jump 
through hoop after hoop after hoop. 
And then, we ask ourselves, why do we 
have a recruitment problem? I think it 
is pretty obvious. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
HOULAHAN), my colleague on the House 
Armed Services Committee, and on the 
Military Personnel Subcommittee, and 
a former servicemember, to comment 
on this issue as well. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, as 
a former servicewoman and a veteran 
myself, I rise today in support of our 
current and future servicewomen and 
their fundamental freedoms. 
The Dobbs decision has already had a 
devastating effect on women across 
this country. According to a recent 
Rand study, 37 percent of service-
women who were pregnant within a 
year of the study had an unintended 
pregnancy. 
Now, nearly half of all Active-Duty 
servicewomen live in States that have

September 20, 2022 
severely curtailed abortion access, and 
this is devastating, of course. 
b 1615 
Access to abortion care is essential 
to a woman’s health, and it is central 
to her economic and social well-being. 
Servicewomen who live in States that 
have banned or restricted abortion now 
must incur the expenses that are nec-
essary to travel to receive medical 
care, and they must now go to their 
commands to ask for permission to 
travel. 
Their military personnel records are 
automatically updated in a system 
showing that they are pregnant. Preg-
nant servicewomen are afforded no 
medical privacy, and they face the 
knowledge that their colleagues and 
their commanders will know if they 
have to travel to seek an abortion. 
With this vital healthcare out of 
reach for some and far too difficult to 
access for others, the consequences are 
widespread and tangible, not just to 
women’s lives, but to this Nation. 
Our military readiness, our reten-
tion, and our recruitment are all in 
jeopardy. 
Our 
servicemembers 
put 
their lives on the line every day de-
fending our freedoms, and now we must 
clearly defend theirs. 
For many, military service is not 
only a call to serve a purpose greater 
than themselves, but it is also, frankly, 
a path to economic stability and to 
educational opportunities. 
To those who say that this is a theo-
retical argument, let me tell you the 
story of a fellow airwoman. Air Force 
Major Theresa Mozzillo, from our Com-
monwealth 
of 
Pennsylvania, 
just 
reached the milestone of 20 years of 
military service. Her promotion to 
Lieutenant Colonel is in just a couple 
of months, and I want to extend my 
gratitude and congratulations on her 
reaching this tremendous milestone. 
As a result of the Dobbs decision, she 
bravely came forward and shared this 
with us. When she was a junior enlisted 
servicemember, making only $550 every 
2 weeks and living in the dorms, she 
had an abortion. She was 21 years old 
and joined the Air Force for the eco-
nomic and educational opportunities it 
provided, like many people do. 
Safe and legal access to abortion al-
lowed her to continue her military 
service 
and 
training 
commitments 
without disruption. This decision to 
utilize vital reproductive healthcare 
helped her to establish a dedicated ca-
reer in our military and to serve this 
great Nation. A decision that today 
might no longer be hers to make. A de-
cision that will no longer be available 
to the 84,000 servicewomen and thou-
sands of spouses and military family 
members who live in States where safe 
access to abortion is now illegal or se-
verely restricted. 
Today, over 42 percent of the mili-
tary is comprised of our most junior 
servicemembers. Today, most junior 
enlisted servicemembers make a little 
over $2,000 a month. Can you imagine 
being forced to become a parent when 
you only make a little over $2,000 a 
month, live in a dormitory, with no 
economic support, no established hous-
ing, and likely no family nearby and 
looming military obligations as well? 
As I mentioned, I am a very proud 
Air Force veteran, in fact, a third-gen-
eration member of the military. My 
military service was pivotal to my own 
personal and professional growth, and I 
rely on lessons I learned in Active- 
Duty service and as a child of an Ac-
tive-Duty member every single day of 
my life. 
We must ensure that women continue 
to have opportunities to serve in our 
military without losing control of their 
own bodies. We must ensure that every 
servicewoman is afforded the same pri-
vacy and bodily autonomy as her peers 
are. We must ensure that every service-
woman and military family member 
has safe and legal access to abortion 
care, regardless of where they are sta-
tioned. 
The economic consequences of being 
forced to become a parent are, for 
many, insurmountable. Regardless of a 
woman’s reason to end a pregnancy, we 
cannot simply abide by an environment 
where a servicewoman is given less 
bodily autonomy than her male coun-
terparts are. 
Women are a vital part of our mili-
tary. In our renewed strategic environ-
ment, and with ongoing recruitment 
and retention challenges across the 
military, we simply cannot afford to 
discourage women from entering mili-
tary service in service of this Nation. 
We must remember that no one has 
the right to interfere with a person’s 
ability to make decisions about their 
own health and their own well-being. 
I ask my colleagues to stand with me 
and with many of us here on the dais 
today on behalf of our Nation’s service-
women. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her service 
then and for her service now. Her com-
ments about young servicewomen just 
out of high school or college, who find 
themselves pregnant and seek an abor-
tion, reminds me of a story that I 
heard at a base here in the United 
States of a young, single mother, serv-
icewoman, who was struggling to take 
care of her young daughter in part be-
cause the childcare—she was lucky 
enough to have childcare at that par-
ticular base. Many of our bases are im-
pacted with long waiting lists. But she 
actually had a slot. But the childcare 
center didn’t open until 6 o’clock, and 
she had to be at physical training and 
exercises at 5:30, so she was always jug-
gling that situation. 
Imagine if you are not even prepared 
to have a child and you are forced to 
give birth to that child and have to 
cope with all of those additional issues 
as well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. JA-
COBS), another colleague on the Sub-
committee on Military Personnel, a 
fellow Californian, and a great member 
of our freshman class. 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairwoman SPEIER 
for her leadership today and her leader-
ship on this issue. It has been truly in-
credible to learn and serve under her. 
I am so proud to represent San 
Diego’s vibrant and diverse military 
community in Congress and on the 
House Committee on Armed Services. 
When I go home and talk to my con-
stituents, they ask me what I am doing 
to make sure their loved ones are 
taken care of, that they are going to be 
safe, not just when they are deployed 
abroad but when they are here at 
home. 
I have to look these families in the 
eye and tell them that right now, their 
loved ones who do so much to serve and 
sacrifice for our country will not nec-
essarily have safe housing, affordable 
childcare, and quality healthcare, in-
cluding reproductive healthcare. 
We owe our servicemembers so much 
more, because even though they volun-
teered to serve in our armed services, 
they didn’t volunteer to give up their 
reproductive rights. Decisions about if, 
when, and how to have a family belong 
to our servicemembers, not the Su-
preme Court or elected officials. Tak-
ing away these fundamental rights 
doesn’t just hurt these individuals. It 
hurts our military readiness, recruit-
ment, retention, and morale, putting 
our national security in jeopardy. 
With 40 percent of Active-Duty serv-
icewomen having very limited or zero 
access to abortion services where they 
are stationed, our military’s ability to 
adapt to evolving conflicts and chal-
lenges is severely compromised. 
I am proud to be from California 
where abortion is currently safe and 
legal. 
But 
not 
everyone 
is 
lucky 
enough to be stationed in California. 
As of July, about 84,000 servicewomen 
were stationed at a base located in a 
State with a trigger law, and with new 
abortion bans going into effect, that 
number will only grow. 
No matter where you live or are sta-
tioned, no matter how much money 
you make, you should have access to 
abortion. 
The truth is, that none of us can take 
our existing State laws for granted, be-
cause a Republican majority in Con-
gress or a Republican President will 
push for a national abortion ban. This 
isn’t even a secret. They have literally 
already introduced it. 
We also need to remember that even 
before the Supreme Court took away 
our constitutional right to abortion, 
servicemembers faced huge barriers to 
accessing 
necessary 
reproductive 
healthcare. The DOD already cannot 
provide or pay for abortions in most 
circumstances, 
and 
servicemembers 
looking for care off base were limited 
by restrictions on travel. After Dobbs, 
abortion access is even harder for serv-
icemembers. They can’t freely take off 
days from work, and many cannot af-
ford to travel the thousands of miles

and pay out of pocket to receive the 
care they need and deserve. 
This is unacceptable. We have a re-
sponsibility to ensure our servicemem-
bers have access to the care they need. 
That is why I joined my friend, Con-
gresswoman SPEIER, to introduce the 
MARCH 
for 
Servicemembers 
Act, 
which would allow military medical 
treatment facilities to provide abor-
tion services and permit the military 
to cover the associated costs. 
It is why I am proud to be an original 
cosponsor of the Access to Reproduc-
tive Care for Servicemembers Act, in-
troduced this week by Congressman 
CROW and Congresswoman SPEIER. This 
crucial legislation would ensure leave 
requests to seek an abortion are con-
fidential and approved without delay 
and push to have DOD provide travel 
reimbursement for those seeking abor-
tion care. 
None of these solutions are radical. 
They are not extreme. All they do is 
empower and support our servicemem-
bers to make their own healthcare de-
cisions. When we have already asked 
our servicemembers to put their lives 
on the line for our freedom, we cannot 
and should not take away theirs. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her out-
standing comments and for her great 
leadership that she has already dem-
onstrated. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MOULTON), a great American leader 
who has served his country a number of 
ways, in a number of situations, cer-
tainly in the military and now as a 
Member of Congress. 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from California for 
her incredible leadership on this and so 
many other issues on the House Com-
mittee on Armed Services. She has 
truly built a legacy which will be hard 
to repeat. 
Signing up for the military is a sac-
rifice. In return, our servicemembers 
should never have to worry about their 
own healthcare being criminalized by 
the very country they have volun-
teered to defend. 
But for an estimated 5,000 to 7,400 Ac-
tive-Duty servicemembers and DOD ci-
vilians who find themselves in need of 
an abortion each year, this is exactly 
what could happen. 
Thousands serve in States they did 
not choose. Many of these places now 
deem abortion a criminal act. 
So what happens next? 
Many of my colleagues would just 
simply suggest: Take leave and travel 
to a State that provides abortions. 
Are we going to force servicemem-
bers to disclose a sexual assault to jus-
tify leave? What about those who 
aren’t authorized to travel due to 
training status? What about women 
with complications who need emer-
gency services? 
Forty percent of Active-Duty service-
women in the U.S. could now be faced 
with significant challenges accessing 
critical healthcare in the wake of the 
Dobbs decision—40 percent. 
Let me be clear, there will be an 
operational impact on military recruit-
ment and retention. 
The Department of Defense must de-
fend all of its servicemembers. We en-
trust these brave young Americans 
with the toughest life-and-death deci-
sions. We ought to trust them to make 
their own healthcare decisions, too. 
This is not only a human right, but it 
is a matter of national security. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for those out-
standing comments. He is another 
Member who has shown incredible lead-
ership on the House Committee on 
Armed Services. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. CROW), my 
good friend and colleague on the House 
Committee on Armed Services, who 
again has shown leadership in the mili-
tary and service in Congress as well, 
and the author of the recently minted 
bill to provide greater protections for 
servicewomen. 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
absolute fury today over what is going 
on to American women and this hor-
rific decision by the Supreme Court to 
take away a fundamental right—for 
the first time in our Nation’s history, 
to take away a fundamental right for 
millions of American women. 
Egregious enough in its own right 
that this has happened, we compound 
it with the fact that tens of thousands 
of women who have stood up to answer 
our Nation’s call, to raise their right 
hand, to take the oath, to give their 
life for this country, to defend our free-
doms, now don’t have the same free-
doms themselves. 
What is going on in this country? 
I served this country as an Army 
Ranger, three combat tours in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. I served with my fellow 
men and women. I now sit in this body. 
I sit on the Committee on Armed Serv-
ices with my good friend, JACKIE 
SPEIER, where we now make policy 
that impacts the very servicemembers 
like I used to be. 
I remember what it was like being 
Private Crow, sitting in those boots, 
having to live with the consequences of 
the decisions made under this dome. I 
think about that now. I think about all 
the young women who want to serve. 
Maybe they want to follow in the foot-
steps of their mother or their grand-
mother. Maybe they are deeply patri-
otic people, and they want to give back 
to their country. Maybe they are try-
ing to pursue better opportunities and 
get some money for college. 
b 1630 
Whatever the motivation, they stand 
up and take the same oath that I took 
and the same oath that millions of oth-
ers have taken over our Nation’s his-
tory. It is an oath that says you are 
willing to give your life and put it all 
on the line for your fellow countrymen 
and -women. Now, we are asking those 
women to not just be willing to give 
their lives in defense of our Nation but 
to do so in a way that sets aside their 
own fundamental rights and their own 
freedoms and gives them second-class 
citizenship in the process of doing it. 
What is going on in this country and 
in this Capitol? We know that abortion 
care is a time-sensitive and necessary 
procedure, and we know that if service-
members can’t access this necessary 
healthcare, their very own health is in 
jeopardy. 
Let’s just take a minute. Let’s just 
set aside the moral arguments. Let’s 
just park those for a minute and just 
talk about military readiness. Let’s 
talk about the defense of this Nation 
that people love to talk about here in 
this Capitol: support the troops, tie a 
yellow ribbon around the tree. All 
right, how about we actually do right 
by the people who are willing to make 
those sacrifices? 
Servicemembers don’t have a choice 
of where they go to serve. That is part 
of the deal. You raise your right hand, 
go to boot camp, get trained on your 
job, and go where the Nation needs 
you. Are we really going to send thou-
sands of women to places where they 
don’t have rights and can’t access 
healthcare? How is that in the inter-
ests of our force? How does that create 
a healthy, productive, vibrant mili-
tary? How is that good for recruiting? 
Well, it is not, obviously. 
It is not often where we have an issue 
that is just so egregiously abusive to 
people who are trying to do the right 
thing. It is not often where we are lit-
erally in a position of dissuading young 
men and women from serving this Na-
tion and making it harder for them to 
do it and making it harder for our mili-
tary to recruit them. 
That is why I have been proud to 
work with JACKIE SPEIER. We started 
this effort by co-leading together the 
MARCH for Servicemembers Act, and 
then we talked to folks. We held 
roundtables. We held discussions. We 
knew that just wasn’t going to do it, 
that that wasn’t enough. We had to do 
more. 
That is why we drafted and are pur-
suing this legislation, the Access to 
Reproductive Care for Servicemembers 
Act, which will require commanders to 
approve leave for abortion care auto-
matically. It will make DOD reimburse 
servicemembers for the cost of travel 
to receive care, and it guarantees pri-
vacy protections for servicemembers 
against retaliation from commanding 
officers and peers. 
Imagine 
that, 
being 
retaliated 
against by your commanding officer. 
Well, it should be illegal, and we are 
going to try to make it illegal. 
Folks, until we can pass a national 
law protecting abortion care and abor-
tion rights for women, which we are 
going to try to do—and we are going to 
have to get rid of the filibuster to do it 
in the Senate—until we do that, we are 
going to do everything possible to pro-
tect everybody we can.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8007 
September 20, 2022 
Now, today, it is going to continue 
with us protecting our servicewomen. 
They are willing to give everything for 
us. The least we can do is have their 
backs. 
We must pass this bill. I implore my 
fellow Members to walk the talk. Don’t 
just talk about supporting our service-
members. Do it. This is the way to do 
it. We can and must do this. We must 
have their back. Let’s get this done. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for really power-
ful remarks. This issue doesn’t have to 
be that hard, but because of legislation 
that has been passed previously, it has 
made it incredibly difficult. 
I am going to share with you now the 
stories of healthcare professionals who 
have provided care to these military 
servicewomen. You have heard from 
my colleagues about some of the serv-
icemembers’ stories. I am now going to 
tell you about two abortion providers, 
one who is Active Duty and the other 
one who is a civilian provider but who 
spends the majority of her career close 
to military installations and provides 
services to our servicewomen. 
The 
Active-Duty 
provider, 
Dr. 
Lamme, had to tell a young woman 
that her child would not live more than 
a few minutes following birth due to 
fetal abnormalities, yet there was 
nothing she could do but hope that the 
young woman could afford the care she 
wanted and deserved off base. She 
could not even provide her abortion 
counseling. She had to kind of hint 
about it. 
This particular patient had to hold a 
fundraiser. Now, think about this. This 
is a servicewoman who has sworn to 
put her life on the line for her country. 
She is in a foreign destination, and she 
is holding a fundraiser to raise the 
funds to fly back to the United States 
to get her abortion. 
Just imagine having to ask your 
friends and family for that money be-
cause the military you have dedicated 
your life to has failed you. She should 
have been able to get that abortion at 
a military treatment facility. Until we 
can lift the Hyde amendment—yes, 
make her pay for it, but don’t make 
her have to develop a GoFundMe page 
to get the resources to fly to a destina-
tion that actually covers abortions. 
Another provider, the civilian pro-
vider, Dr. Moayedi, shared her experi-
ence of literally watching her patient 
count quarters—quarters—to pay for 
her abortion. Her patient opted to go 
without sedation to terminate a preg-
nancy because she couldn’t afford any 
more out-of-pocket costs. 
There is nothing humane, nothing re-
spectful, about treating servicewomen 
like this. 
If it is the intention of the military 
to force women out of the military, to 
create an all-male force, then maybe 
this is the way to go. Maybe this is 
what they had in mind. 
But, we do know that we need women 
in the force. We know that there is a 
small percentage of men and women 
who are eligible to serve in the mili-
tary because of their abilities or lack 
thereof. It is a small percentage to 
begin with, and a smaller percentage 
yet who choose to serve. 
Twenty percent of the military now 
is made up of female servicemembers. 
We only see that number growing in 
order to have a ready service to be able 
to go to war when necessary. But now 
we are doing things that are discour-
aging women to even contemplate be-
coming a member of the service. 
Under current law, the DOD is pro-
hibited from providing or paying for 
abortions except in cases of rape, in-
cest, or a threat to the mother’s life. 
These exceptions are so very narrow 
and interpreted so narrowly that the 
DOD has confirmed to me that the 
number of abortions that have been 
done at military treatment facilities in 
a year is between 11 and 21. 
Now, the RAND study purports that 
there are probably 4,000 women in serv-
ice in this country in the various serv-
ices that get an abortion every year. 
Only 11 to 21 of them are done at mili-
tary treatment facilities. That means 
3,980 women in the service have to pay 
for and also go elsewhere to seek that 
service. They have to pay out of pocket 
not only for the care they need but also 
for other expenses, including lodging, 
gas, airfare, and childcare. 
The Dobbs decision will no doubt ex-
acerbate these challenges, forcing serv-
icemembers to travel greater distances 
and shoulder greater financial bur-
dens—that is, if they are granted leave 
in the first place. 
Imagine you are assaulted. You want 
to go get an abortion. You are in the 
State of Texas, and you have to go to 
your commander and seek leave. By 
the way, if you seek leave and you were 
raped and have, I guess, a police report, 
they might let you have that leave 
without having you being docked for it. 
But if you are not one of those 
women who has been raped or the vic-
tim of incest, but did, in fact, get preg-
nant and want to terminate, you have 
to go to your commander in Texas. 
Right now, you have to divulge the 
service you are asking for, and you are 
going to get docked in leave, as well. 
It is inhumane to force women to re-
main pregnant against their will. It is 
just fundamental to freedom to be able 
to have control over your own body. It 
is arrogant to think that we know bet-
ter than a woman and her doctor about 
what is best for her body. It is wrong to 
create 
government-mandated 
preg-
nancies, and it is wrong for the mili-
tary to require its servicewomen to 
jump through so many hoops and spend 
so much money out of pocket because 
we have some antiquated law on the 
books that says you can’t get an abor-
tion at an MTF, a military treatment 
facility. 
Access to abortion care is essential 
to women’s health and central to their 
economic and social well-being. The 
ability to access abortion should not 
depend on how much money you have, 
where you live, or where you are sta-
tioned. 
That is why I, along with my col-
leagues, have introduced the MARCH 
for Servicemembers Act, to enable 
DOD to provide abortion care once and 
for all. 
At the very least, servicewomen 
should be able to access abortion care 
within MTFs and pay out of pocket 
just like they can for other procedures. 
The military does not cover IVF, but 
they will perform IVF at a military fa-
cility, and you will just pay for the re-
sidual cost. 
I am proud to co-lead the Access to 
Reproductive Care for Servicemembers 
Act that the gentleman from Colorado 
(Mr. CROW), my good friend, just ref-
erenced. It would require DOD to pay 
any travel expenses associated with an 
abortion and ensure servicemembers 
are able to take leave for their care. 
There is a part of me that says we 
have 128 bases and installations in 
these red States, in these States that 
ban abortion. Maybe we should just 
move these bases. Now, that is highly 
unlikely because we have invested so 
much, but it just begs the question 
about what we are really all about if 
we are going to treat these service-
women so poorly. 
My office has been inundated with 
outreach from former and current serv-
icemembers who are anxious and de-
spondent about being stationed in what 
they are referring to as ‘‘forced preg-
nancy States.’’ 
One Army psychiatrist said to me, 
‘‘Even I and some of my female physi-
cian peers in the military, with the rel-
ative privilege of being officers and 
physicians, fear someday receiving or-
ders to a State which has banned abor-
tion. Because of the increased maternal 
mortality in areas without safe and 
legal abortion, I would not feel safe at-
tempting to become pregnant in such a 
State.’’ 
Let me repeat that. This is a medical 
professional in the military who says: 
‘‘I would not feel safe attempting to be-
come pregnant in such a State.’’ 
b 1645 
Again, at a time when the military is 
struggling with recruitment and reten-
tion, these bans make things worse. 
We must act now to provide the right 
resources at the right time and the 
right place so that servicemembers and 
their families who have no choice 
about where they live continue to have 
access to the full reproductive care 
they need, want, and deserve. 
These men and women who serve are 
our greatest patriots. Are we really 
going to treat them as second-class 
citizens? These members of the mili-
tary defend our freedoms, and we are 
going to defend them. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congresswoman SPEIER for organizing 
this Special Order Hour to highlight 
how state abortion restrictions impact

our nation’s brave servicemembers and 
their families. 
The military is a male-dominated in-
stitution where women make up only 
20 percent of active-duty forces, and 
significantly less at senior leadership 
levels. As a result, women’s healthcare 
needs are cast aside. TRICARE doesn’t 
cover abortion services, except in cases 
of rape, incest, or to save the mother’s 
life, forcing servicemembers to leave 
the military base to seek reproductive 
care. 
With 
the 
upending 
of 
Roe, 
servicemembers in states that restrict 
abortion must travel even further on 
their own dime to seek basic reproduc-
tive healthcare, risking their career 
and standing in the ranks. This is out-
rageous and wholly unacceptable. It 
sacrifices the readiness of our troops 
and perpetuates a discriminatory envi-
ronment for women in the military. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of Congresswoman SPEIER’s legisla-
tion, the MARCH for Servicemembers 
Act, to remove the statutory ban on 
military treatment facilities providing 
abortion services and Department of 
Defense funds being used to perform 
abortions. 
I believe it is our collective responsi-
bility to ensure that every American 
who wears a uniform to defend our 
country has the health services, oppor-
tunities, and care they need and de-
serve. This is a promise we must keep, 
and I certainly will. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to condemn the disturbing Dobbs 
decision handed down by the Supreme Court 
recently. 
With the Dobbs decision, the Supreme 
Court overturned two historic rulings—Roe v. 
Wade and Planned Parenthood of South-
eastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. 
These two decisions established a constitu-
tional right to obtain the medical procedure 
known as an abortion. 
With the Dobbs decision, for the first time in 
nearly 50 years, Republicans have succeeded 
in making sure America’s daughters have less 
freedom than their mothers. 
Republicans did this by taking away a wom-
an’s right to have an abortion. 
It’s simple. This decision was made for one 
reason and one reason only: to control women 
and female service members, and their repro-
ductive health care. 
All women, and especially those who have 
put their life in harm’s way to serve their coun-
try, should have the right to choose their own 
reproductive health care. 
Sadly, nearly 80,000 female service mem-
bers—40 percent of them on active duty—will 
have no access or very limited access to abor-
tion services in the U.S. 
On top of that, women serving in the military 
experience unintended pregnancy rates 22 
percent greater than civilians. 
According to a study in 2020, between 
2,500 through 4,100 active-duty servicewomen 
have an abortion annually. 
Now, because of the right-wing Supreme 
Court, servicemembers stationed in states that 
ban abortion now may need to travel long dis-
tances to obtain an abortion. 
In my home state of Texas, there are 15 
military bases. 
Female servicemembers stationed at these 
bases would virtually need to travel out of 
state in all cases to get an abortion. As Texas 
has banned abortions in all cases—even rape 
or incest. 
Shockingly, they need to use their own per-
sonal leave to travel out of state. This is abso-
lutely crazy. 
You see, only a very small amount of these 
abortions are done at military facilities as cur-
rent laws prohibit military health insurance 
from covering abortions. 
The only exceptions are unless the preg-
nancy is a result of rape or incest, or the 
mother is at risk of death. 
Seriously, everyone, put yourselves in the 
shoes of a young E–1 in the military. An E– 
1 is the beginning rank for a military career— 
their pay is roughly $22,000 a year. 
That is about $1,833 a month. Trust me, it’s 
not easy to travel out of a large state like 
Texas on that type of salary. 
Many of these servicemembers don’t even 
have cars as they are just beginning their mili-
tary life and move to different bases con-
stantly. 
These are dedicated and strong women 
who have fundamental rights and should be 
able to decide for themselves. 
They do not need Republican lawmakers 
telling them what is best for their health. 
This is cruel. It’s not right. And it must stop. 
This is not how servicemembers should be 
treated. We should be honoring them and their 
service, but Republicans are only seeking to 
control them and their bodies. 
Even worse, the Supreme Court’s decision 
to overturn Dobbs has served as a catalyst for 
a wave of anti-women efforts led by Repub-
licans across our country. 
Some Republicans even want to ban contra-
ception now. It’s ridiculous. 
But House Democrats, Rep. SPEIER, we 
won’t let them. 
We promise to always stand by women and 
fight for their rights. That’s why House Demo-
crats passed bills like the: 
Right to Contraception Act; 
Women’s Health Protection Act; and 
Ensuring Women’s Right to Reproductive 
Freedom Act. 
We passed these bills because House 
Democrats trust women and servicemembers. 
We always have and we always will.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, our 
overwhelmed Customs and Border Pro-
tection personnel have already encoun-
tered more than 2 million illegal immi-
grants and counting just this fiscal 
year. 
This is a larger group of people than 
the entire populations of 14 States, and 
this record-shattering 2 million appre-
hensions only counts the subset of peo-
ple who were actually caught. Experts 
estimate hundreds of thousands more 
people on top of that number who sim-
ply got away. 
The latest reports say that CBP en-
countered more than 200,000 people just 
in the month of August alone, and 
more than 20 percent of those people 
were not first-time border crossers but 
rather repeat offenders who had al-
ready previously been expelled or de-
ported; tens of thousands of individuals 
who had already been thrown out, 
flooding back in every single month. 
Orderly, legal immigration is part of 
what makes America strong; anarchy 
and open borders make us weak. 
There is nothing compassionate or 
humane about the border crisis that 
Democrats’ mixed signals and failed 
policies have unleashed. 
It is not fair to American citizens; it 
is not fair to law enforcement; and it is 
not fair to the people who have been 
encouraged to undertake desperate and 
dangerous journeys by years of Demo-
crats signaling to the world that there 
are no real consequences for breaking 
our laws and cutting in line. 
Vice President HARRIS says ‘‘the bor-
der is secure.’’ The American people 
know better, and they are furious. Ille-
gal immigrants know better as well. 
For years, Washington Democrats 
have attacked Republicans for calling 
for basic border security and law en-
forcement. The Democratic Party line 
throughout the last 5 years has been 
that enforcing existing immigration 
law would be cruel and securing our 
borders would be xenophobic, but over 
the last few days, some liberals seem to 
have changed their tune.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4830 
September 20, 2022 
Out of desperation, a few Governors 
along our southern border are now giv-
ing some Democrat-run States and cit-
ies just a tiny, tiny taste of what bor-
der communities have been enduring, 
literally, for years. 
According to the Washington Post, 
the total number of individuals whom 
Texas and Arizona have helped relocate 
to New York, Washington, and other 
places in recent months is roughly on 
the order of the number of illegal im-
migrants who arrive at our southern 
border in a single day—1 day. 
All those cities combined have had 
months to accept, between them, ap-
proximately 1 day’s share of our Na-
tion’s illegal immigration. 
But the Democratic mayor of New 
York City is now declaring that his 
government’s 
resources 
are 
‘‘at 
a 
breaking point’’—at a breaking point. 
According to the Post, these border 
States have sent to New York City less 
than 1 day’s worth of illegal crossers, 
spread out over more than a month, 
and the self-proclaimed sanctuary city 
apparently cannot take it. 
The Governor of Florida helped a 
tiny number of illegal immigrants, 
about four dozen, secure transportation 
to the wealthy liberal destination of 
Martha’s Vineyard, filled with million-
aires’ mansions, which appointed itself 
a so-called sanctuary destination back 
in 2017. 
Apparently, this sanctuary destina-
tion tolerated, fed, and housed the new-
comers for less than 48 hours before 
having the National Guard promptly 
put them on a ferry and remove them 
to a military base instead. 
Democrats, liberal activists, and the 
media are, predictably, melting down. 
There are absurd accusations flying 
around that it is somehow evil or ille-
gal for Republican officials to help ille-
gal immigrants move within our coun-
try. That would be breaking news be-
cause, of course, the Biden administra-
tion has been flying and busing illegal 
immigrants around the country on a 
regular basis. 
According to one report from early 
2021, the Biden administration was al-
ready filling Greyhound buses with 
people turning up at our border and 
driving them to various destinations 
from the South to the Midwest to the 
Northeast. Ah, but it was never to Mar-
tha’s Vineyard. 
So these well-to-do blue enclaves are 
finally witnessing the smallest fraction 
of the challenges that open borders 
have enforced on working-class com-
munities all across our country. 
INFLATION 
Mr. President, now on another mat-
ter, Washington Democrats’ runaway 
inflation has caused a nationwide cri-
sis. It has put working families and 
small businesses in a bind from coast 
to coast. 
Since President Biden took office, in-
flation has shot up a staggering 13.2 
percent. For the average American 
household, this translates to hundreds 
and hundreds of extra dollars every 
month, working overtime just to bare-
ly—barely—tread water. 
In my home State of Kentucky, for 
example, the Democrats’ inflation has 
forced proud, hard-working families to 
ask for help putting food on the table; 
in some cases, for the first time in 
their lives. 
The director of the Jessamine County 
Food Pantry in Nicholasville says: 
Our numbers here are going up like crazy. 
. . . We have problems actually getting food 
now. We’re actually not giving away as much 
as we were just a couple months ago because 
I can’t find it, and I can’t afford it some-
times when I can find it. 
And, of course, these challenges 
aren’t limited to the Commonwealth. 
In Clifton, CO, the director of one 
local food bank reports that she had 
served 1,000 more families in the first 
half of this year than in the first half 
of last year. Here is her quote: 
They cannot short their rent bill, but they 
can short their grocery bill. And so they 
come here so I can fill the gap. 
In coastal Georgia, the director of a 
network of food banks says distribu-
tion at her facilities had increased 38 
percent from July to August. Meeting 
the increased demand has meant stom-
aching steep spikes in meat and dairy 
prices. 
In Concord, NH, the director of the 
Friendly Kitchen says no one is ever 
turned away, but more and more people 
keep showing up for dinner. 
I’m nervous it’s going to get worse. I think 
it’s going to get worse before it gets better. 
Washington Democrats’ inflation is 
absolutely hammering States like Col-
orado, Georgia, and New Hampshire. 
And Senate Republicans—we tried to 
stop it. We warned against inflation. 
We tried to block their $2 trillion infla-
tionary bill. We offered amendments. 
But all three of those States have two 
Senators who both voted in lockstep on 
party lines to ram through trillions— 
trillions—of dollars. One hundred per-
cent of the U.S. Senators from those 
States voted to bring this on. 
This is what happens when Wash-
ington Democrats put their own prior-
ities ahead of our people. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
KIGALI AMENDMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, later 
today, the Senate will take the first 
step toward ratifying an amendment to 
one of the most successful inter-
national environmental agreements in 
modern history, the Kigali Amendment 
to the Montreal Protocol. 
Members can expect to cast the first 
vote on cloture later this afternoon 
after the weekly party lunches. To-
day’s vote will require 60 votes in the 
affirmative to move forward. And since 
the Kigali Amendment is part of a 
treaty, it will require two-thirds of the 
Chamber to ultimately ratify this pro-
vision. 
The Kigali Amendment will be one of 
the most significant bipartisan meas-
ures the Senate takes on all year, and 
that is saying something, because we 
have done a lot. 
It would affirm our country’s inten-
tion 
to 
phase 
down 
the 
use 
of 
hydrofluorocarbons—commonly known 
as HFCs—by 85 percent over the next 15 
years. Experts say this step alone could 
prevent half a degree Celsius of warm-
ing by the end of the 21st century. Is 
that incredible? Half a degree. We 
struggle to get there. This one measure 
will do it. That may not seem like 
much, but within the larger context of 
global temperature, it is really very 
significant. 
There are two paths our country can 
take, depending on what we do with 
the Kigali Amendment. If we ratify 
this treaty, not only will we protect 
our planet, but this is an economic 
issue and an issue to go after China, 
which is a rogue nation in this regard. 
It will provide us a golden opportunity 
for American businesses to dominate in 
emerging business. 
Every year, millions of refrigerators 
and AC units are sold around the world; 
and in the United States, many fami-
lies own more than one refrigerator. 
That is a lot of appliances that will 
need HFC alternatives, which U.S. 
businesses, particularly, are working 
to prepare for. By one measure, the 
combined 
impact 
of 
ratifying 
the 
Kigali Amendment and other steps we 
have taken to reduce HFCs would cre-
ate 150,000 new jobs and generate near-
ly $39 billion in investment by 2027 as 
new markets open up for trade. So this, 
in many ways, is a pro-jobs measure, 
one supported by the Chamber of Com-
merce, 
by 
major 
retailers 
like 
Walmart, by the Semiconductor Indus-
try Association, and many other busi-
ness groups. 
If we fail to ratify the amendment, 
the rest of the world is going to move 
on without us. Without Kigali, we are 
going to play second fiddle to nations 
like China, whose businesses will sur-
pass ours in developing viable HFC al-
ternatives, taking jobs that, by all 
rights, belong here in America. And by 
2033, parties to Kigali will be prohib-
ited—prohibited—from any trade in 
HFCs with non-Kigali nations. We will 
lose out tens of billions of dollars of 
sales. 
There is no reason to have that hap-
pen. Ratifying Kigali will not require 
any change in the current U.S. law. We 
already have domestic policies phasing 
out HFCs here at home, so we are put-
ting into practice many of the reforms 
the Kigali Amendment calls for, and no 
consumer will have to change any ap-
pliance. 
So for the sake of U.S. businesses, for 
the sake of U.S. innovators, for the

sake of making sure China has to com-
ply and be part of the world commu-
nity and not do what they think is just 
good for themselves—which seems to 
be President Xi’s way of doing things— 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
advancing the Kigali Amendment later 
today. It is low-hanging fruit for cre-
ating tens of thousands of good-paying 
jobs right here at home. 
DISCLOSE ACT 
Mr. President, now on the DISCLOSE 
Act. Later today, President Biden will 
deliver remarks on one of the gravest 
dangers undermining our democracy— 
the power of dark money that has 
taken over our elections. 
I expect the President’s remarks will 
preview action here in the Senate, 
where we will have a vote this week to 
begin debate on the DISCLOSE Act—a 
bill I long promised to bring to the 
floor. My colleagues, led by the inde-
fatigable and relentless and brilliant 
Senator WHITEHOUSE, have done a won-
derful job championing this issue for 
years. 
The DISCLOSE Act is very simple to 
grasp: it would require super PACs and 
other dark money groups to report 
anyone contributing $10,000 or more 
during an election cycle. The same 
goes for any group spending any money 
in support of or in opposition to judi-
cial nominees. In other words, it would 
require similar forms of transparency 
that traditional campaigns and can-
didates already face. We have to dis-
close when accepting political con-
tributions. 
And, frankly, why shouldn’t this be 
law? What reason under Heaven is 
there for keeping massive political 
contributions hidden from the public? 
Even the Republican leader, who has 
dedicated much of his career, unfortu-
nately, to killing many campaign fi-
nance reforms, claimed in the past to 
support increased disclosure; though, 
sadly, he is opposed to our bill today 
for no good reason. If you are for dis-
closure, you should be for our bill, and 
these flimsy arguments that it will 
deter people from giving are absurd— 
absurd. 
If a multimillionaire wants to spend 
colossal sums on candidates or nomi-
nees who are deeply anti-choice or who 
will support anti-democracy candidates 
or who will harbor views deeply in con-
flict with the views of the general pub-
lic, shouldn’t the public have at least 
the right to know it? 
The rights of voters and the health of 
our democracy far outweigh any inter-
est that a multibillionaire could have 
in concealing political spending from 
public scrutiny. 
So, the DISCLOSE Act will give 
every Senator a choice: a vote to bring 
transparency to our elections or stand 
with the forces of dark money. 
Let me say that again. The DIS-
CLOSE Act will give every Senator a 
choice: vote to bring transparency to 
our elections, remove the veil from 
this dark money that the public hates 
that is cascading into our elections or 
stand on the side of dark money. Who 
wants to be on that side? We will see 
this week. 
I want to take a moment to thank 
my colleague, Senator WHITEHOUSE, for 
his incredible work in championing 
this legislation. He is arguably the 
Senate’s greatest champion in the fight 
against dark money, someone who has 
dedicated years to uncovering the per-
nicious links between dark money 
groups and radical judicial nominees. 
Do you want to know one of the main 
reasons we have a ‘‘MAGA’’ Court that 
overturns Roe v. Wade, that stands in 
the way of smart gun control laws and 
gun safety laws, that stands in the way 
of environmental progress? It is be-
cause of dark money, in good part— 
dark money. 
SHELDON
WHITEHOUSE
has exposed 
this link better than anyone I know. 
He has gotten the rest of us to pay at-
tention in a deeper way to the gravity 
of this issue. He will come to the floor 
later today and throughout the week 
to continue highlighting this issue. 
And I know others will be joining to 
stand by his side. 
I thank him for his work. I thank the 
President for speaking about it this 
afternoon. And I stand with Senator 
WHITEHOUSE in highlighting this issue 
ahead of the vote, and I urge my col-
leagues to support the DISCLOSE Act. 
NOMINATION OF FLORENCE Y. PAN 
Mr. President, in other matters, 
today, the Senate will vote to confirm 
our sixth circuit court judge in the 
month of September—Judge Florence 
Pan—to sit on the all-important DC 
Circuit Court of Appeals. If confirmed, 
Judge Pan will make history as the 
first Taiwanese American ever to serve 
on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, 
joining in the proud company of so 
many other Biden nominees who have 
expanded the diversity and experience 
of the Federal bench. 
As we all know, the DC Circuit Court 
is the second-most important Federal 
court in the country after the Supreme 
Court. Before this court comes disputes 
that involve Congress and much of the 
Federal Government, so many of its de-
cisions involve constitutional or ad-
ministrative law. It goes without say-
ing that nominees to this court must 
be individuals of the highest caliber. 
They need to be experienced, balanced, 
and above all, committed to the rule of 
law. 
That is exactly what we have in 
Judge Pan. She has had over a decade 
of experience as a judge in the District 
of Columbia and has seen practically 
every legal dispute under the Sun. She 
is already well-known to this Chamber, 
having been confirmed as a district 
judge with 68 votes. She should be simi-
larly confirmed with bipartisan sup-
port. 
PUERTO RICO 
Mr. President, last, but certainty not 
least: Puerto Rico. As our fellow Amer-
icans in Puerto Rico continue to feel 
the wrath of Hurricane Fiona, we con-
tinue to monitor the situation here in 
Congress. Over the weekend, President 
Biden issued an emergency disaster 
declaration for Puerto Rico with 75 
percent of the costs of emergency med-
ical care, disaster response, and food 
distribution to be covered by the Fed-
eral Government. 
Yesterday, I got on the phone with 
the FEMA Administrator and urged 
FEMA to approve Puerto Rico’s re-
quest to increase that figure to 100 per-
cent and to stand ready to approve a 
major disaster declaration request to 
unlock not just response money but 
funding needed to recover and rebuild. 
On the call were my colleagues Rep-
resentatives 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
and 
ESPAILLAT, and I echoed the calls from 
my colleagues to ensure maximum 
flexibility for those applying for FEMA 
assistance and to get Federal funding 
out of the door ASAP. Puerto Rico des-
perately needs it. 
Later this morning, I will join with 
the Hispanic Federation and a number 
of my colleagues to talk about addi-
tional steps we are calling on the Fed-
eral Government to take, including 
steps to strengthen Puerto Rico’s elec-
tric grid. The electric grid is almost 50 
years out-of-date. It is particularly 
susceptible to hurricanes. It hasn’t 
even been repaired since the damage 
Hurricane Maria, 5 years ago, put upon 
it. Yet, we have given lots of Federal 
money for the reestablishment or the 
rebuilding of the grid, and very little 
has happened. So we need to focus on 
that issue as well as others. 
Five years to the day after the ar-
rival of Maria, Puerto Rico needs help 
to recover from Fiona. We need to 
make sure, this time, Puerto Rico has 
absolutely everything it needs as soon 
as possible for as long as they need it. 
I yield the floor.

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
VIOLENCE 
AND 
THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST 
THE EMPLOYEES OF THE FED-
ERAL 
BUREAU 
OF 
INVESTIGA-
TION ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND 
SHOULD BE CONDEMNED 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to condemn the violence and 
threats of violence against the men and 
women of the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation. 
I take these threats seriously. This 
July 1, I chaired the Judiciary Com-
mittee hearing on law enforcement of-
ficer safety and the threats our law en-
forcement officers are facing. I have re-
peatedly made clear that violence 
against law enforcement is never— 
never—acceptable no matter what ide-
ology motivates it, but here is the re-
ality. 
In the past month, following the 
FBI’s execution of a search warrant at 
Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, the 
FBI has faced a flood of threats against 
its employees and its facilities, and 
these threats have been egged on by 
the former President and his allies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4832 
September 20, 2022 
The men and women of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation literally put 
their lives on the line every day to 
keep all of us safe. They put them-
selves in harm’s way to stop armed 
criminals, drug traffickers, terrorist 
organizations, and others who threaten 
our communities. They serve on the 
frontlines of the opioid epidemic and 
investigate and hold accountable those 
who traffic illegal opioids and who ille-
gally prescribe pharmaceutical opioids. 
They investigate crimes against chil-
dren and human trafficking—some of 
the most heinous crimes imaginable. 
They work day in and day out to com-
bat international and domestic ter-
rorism, and they carry out judicially 
issued search warrants every day. That 
is part of their job and an important 
role that they play in our justice sys-
tem. 
Unfortunately, ever since the August 
8 Mar-a-Lago search, their dedication 
has been repaid with a flood of baseless 
attacks and violent threats. Attacking 
the FBI for his own political advantage 
is nothing new for the former Presi-
dent, but the attacks haven’t stopped 
with him. His allies and followers have 
spewed anti-FBI vitriol online and 
across the airwaves. In recent weeks, 
there have been calls from Republican 
Members of Congress to ‘‘destroy’’ and 
‘‘defund’’ the FBI. There have been 
calls from Republican congressional 
candidates to ‘‘gut’’ the FBI ‘‘like a 
fish’’ and ‘‘shoot FBI, IRS, ATF, and 
all other feds on sight.’’ So it is no sur-
prise that such outrageous and irre-
sponsible rhetoric coincides with a 
stunning increase in violent threats 
against the FBI. 
Last month, the FBI and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security issued a 
joint intelligence bulletin detailing an 
increase in violent threats and acts of 
violence against Federal law enforce-
ment officials following the August 8 
Mar-a-Lago 
search. 
These 
include 
threats to place a ‘‘dirty bomb’’ out-
side of the FBI headquarters and online 
calls for civil war and armed rebellion. 
On August 11, a man wearing body 
armor—armed with an AR–15 assault 
rifle and a nail gun—attempted to 
breach the FBI’s Cincinnati field office. 
On August 16, another man was in-
dicted for threatening to murder every-
one at the FBI, from Director Wray to 
the custodial staff. On August 25, a 
man jumped the fence at FBI’s Chicago 
field office but, thankfully, was de-
tained and taken to a local hospital for 
evaluation before he could hurt any-
one. 
In response to the joint intelligence 
bulletin and these incidents, I asked 
the FBI and the Department of Home-
land Security to have a private briefing 
with Members of the Senate’s Judici-
ary and Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental 
Affairs 
Committees 
last 
week. That briefing only added to my 
concern. 
I cannot share the specifics from this 
closed-door briefing, but I will say this: 
It should go without saying that the 
men and women of the FBI risk their 
lives every day on our behalf, but the 
increase in threats to their personal 
safety since the August 8 Mar-a-Lago 
search warrant is shocking. Beyond the 
direct threats and violence, there are 
also rising concerns about the public 
spread of personal information about 
the FBI’s employees and families—a 
practice known as doxing. I fear the 
situation may get worse. 
Last 
Thursday, 
former 
President 
Trump kept up his threatening rhet-
oric against these law enforcement of-
ficers. He said that if he were indicted 
for his actions, ‘‘I think you’d have 
problems in this country the likes of 
which, perhaps, we’ve never seen be-
fore. I don’t think the people of the 
United States would stand for it.’’ That 
is exactly the kind of language Presi-
dent Trump used after he lost the 2020 
election to incite the January 6 attack 
here at the Capitol. 
As I have said many times, political 
violence and threats of violence in the 
furtherance of any cause—any cause— 
is unacceptable. It is time for the Sen-
ate to stand up and support the men 
and women of the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation who have been threatened 
and attacked for simply doing their 
jobs and working to protect America. 
Let’s condemn these baseless attacks 
on the men and women of the FBI and 
the despicable political game they rep-
resent. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 775, submitted earlier today. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report the resolu-
tion by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 775) expressing the 
sense of the Senate that violence and threats 
of violence against the employees of the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation are unaccept-
able and should be condemned. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 775) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this res-
olution which just passed without ob-
jection from any Member of the Senate 
will be a reminder to the men and 
women who serve in law enforcement, 
particularly in the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, that we stand behind 
them and that those who would exploit 
political events at the expense of the 
safety of these men and women are be-
yond the pale of constitutional con-
duct. We want to stand behind those 
who are standing for us—to protect us 
and our families. 
I thank the Senate for agreeing to 
this resolution. It is timely; it is im-
portant; and it is clear. 
f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened to the Republican minority lead-
er, Senator MCCONNELL, speak on the 
floor this morning. I have to tell you, 
on the issue of immigration, there are 
several things which he said which are 
not accurate and that I would like to 
clarify for the RECORD. 
First, this morning, Senator MCCON-
NELL said: 
Orderly, legal immigration is part of what 
makes America strong. Anarchy and open 
borders make us weak. 
I don’t know of any rational person 
who would disagree with that com-
ment. 
But I think, for the record, we should 
make clear that, 8 years ago, when we 
considered comprehensive immigration 
reform—a bipartisan bill—on the floor 
of the U.S. Senate, the Senator from 
Kentucky voted against it. There were 
14 Republican Senators who voted for 
this measure. It passed the Senate. It 
was the product of a bipartisan Com-
mission—a self-appointed committee, 
really—the so-called Gang of 8. I want 
to recount the names of those who 
were on that committee who produced 
a comprehensive immigration reform 
bill. I was on the committee with 
CHUCK SCHUMER, Senator BOB MENEN-
DEZ, and the Senator from the Pre-
siding Officer’s home State of Colo-
rado, Senator MICHAEL BENNET. On the 
Republican side, it was led by Senator 
John McCain, Senator LINDSEY GRA-
HAM, Senator MARCO RUBIO, and then- 
Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake. 
We worked for months. We put in all 
of the effort that was expected of us to 
address an issue which had not been ad-
dressed by Congress for 25 years, which 
was to try to upgrade our immigration 
system—to do what Senator MCCON-
NELL says needs to be done: orderly, 
legal immigration. That was what the 
bill sought to achieve. There were 14 
Republicans who joined us in voting for 
it. Senator MCCONNELL did not, and we 
have not had another measure since 
then. 
The bill we passed in the Senate was 
sent over to the Republican-controlled 
House of Representatives. They refused 
to even consider it in committee or on 
the floor or to bring it to a vote. We 
missed an opportunity, and it was an 
opportunity on many different levels. 
It would have finally addressed the 
issue of legal immigration in America, 
which is a critically important meas-
ure. 
Throughout our history, without ex-
ception, year in and year out, legal im-
migrants have come to this country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4833 
September 20, 2022 
There have been some terrible laws 
passed by Congress in relation to those 
having been allowed in this country. 
The reality is we have acknowledged 
from the beginning of America as we 
know it that immigrants have been a 
part of our present and are a part of 
our future, and now we face the same 
reality again without the benefit of 
having an update in the laws, which 
the Republican leader voted against. 
I recall specifically the work of Sen-
ator BENNET from Colorado. He did a 
remarkable thing, something that peo-
ple didn’t think was really possible. He 
managed to bring together all of the 
interest groups on the issue of legal 
immigration for those working in agri-
culture. He managed to find an agree-
ment among all of these groups as to 
the humane and sensible treatment of 
these individuals. If that would have 
passed, it would have changed the cir-
cumstances 
we 
have 
today—cir-
cumstances wherein we do not have 
nearly enough legal immigrants to 
work in the agricultural sector of 
America. It is estimated that one out 
of two—50 percent—of all of the ag 
workers today are undocumented. We 
still eat the food that they pick and 
harvest, and we still take advantage of 
their hard work in the meat processing 
plants. Yet the reality is that we know, 
in our heart of hearts, that they are 
not being treated in a sensible, reason-
able, humane way. 
Senator BENNET, time and again, has 
shown leadership on this issue as he did 
with the Gang of 8. Once again, we find 
ourselves, because the bill failed in the 
previous Congress, without a guiding 
law on standards of immigration. 
There were other things said by Sen-
ator MCCONNELL this morning which I 
want to make reference to as well, par-
ticularly as to the busing of those cur-
rently in the United States, as new, le-
gally recognized immigrants, to var-
ious cities around the United States. 
Governors from the States of Texas, 
Arizona, and Florida have been busing 
those who have been crossing the bor-
der and who are legally recognized to 
stay here until further hearing to com-
munities like New York, Washington, 
Chicago, and even to Martha’s Vine-
yard in Massachusetts. The thing that 
we have got to keep in mind is that 
these Governors do not call local offi-
cials first. They don’t even contact the 
Governors of these States where they 
are sending these people. So they ar-
rive, helter-skelter, in unpredictable 
numbers and conditions, and the local 
officials are expected to take care of 
them. 
Listen to what Senator MCCONNELL 
had to say in describing what I have 
just told you. 
He said: 
Out of desperation, a few Governors along 
our southern border are now giving some 
Democrat-run States and cities just a tiny, 
tiny taste of what border communities have 
been enduring literally for years. 
What he is trying to say to us is this 
is an act of political spite. It is a polit-
ical stunt by these Governors. And 
what are they using to make their 
point? Innocent people—here legally in 
the 
United 
States—who 
are 
being 
shipped off, many times, with decep-
tion and promises that will never be 
kept in terms of opportunities for them 
in these various places. 
Senator MCCONNELL went on to say: 
All those cities combined have had months 
to accept between them approximately 1 
day’s share of our Nation’s illegal immigra-
tion. 
Immigrants—about four dozen—were 
given secure transportation, according 
to 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, 
‘‘to 
the 
wealthy, liberal destination of Mar-
tha’s Vineyard, filled with million-
aires’ mansions’’—so-called sanctuary 
destinations. 
Do you see the point that is being 
made here? These people are being 
bused without any warning as to where 
they are going to end up—where their 
final destinations may be—simply to 
make the political point that the 
Democrats have to be reminded of the 
Republicans’ position on immigration. 
We are doing this at the expense of 
many innocent people, and we are 
doing this in a dangerous fashion. 
I will tell you that I visited the Sal-
vation Army center in Chicago, IL, 
about 10 days ago, and I met with these 
families and individuals. Little chil-
dren are involved in this calculation. 
Why is it that whenever the Repub-
licans want to make a point on immi-
gration, it always ends up being the 
children who are the pawns, whether 
they are kids in cages or forcefully re-
moving children from their parents or 
in this case, busing them off with their 
parents to communities they have 
never heard of? Why does it always in-
volve families with small children? 
You would think there would be more 
sensitivity on the Republican side to 
that reality. 
Then Senator MCCONNELL
made a 
statement which I want to correct. He 
said the Biden administration has been 
flying and busing illegal immigrants 
around the country on a regular basis. 
This is not true. We checked again this 
morning with the Biden administra-
tion. They are not exercising that 
right. 
What we have going on are the trans-
fers of those who are not in legal status 
back and forth between various facili-
ties and the transfers of unaccom-
panied children, with escorts, to places 
like Chicago and other cities where, for 
decades, they have been cared for until 
their legal status is resolved. But this 
statement that the Biden administra-
tion is guilty of busing people back and 
forth is not true at all. I think the 
record should be clarified, and I hope 
the Senator from Kentucky will do so 
when he receives the first opportunity. 
The Biden administration has said: 
We have the authority to do it, but we 
have not exercised it and will not un-
less we confer with Congress and also 
notify local officials as to whether any-
one will be moved. 
Now, there are circumstances and 
have been in the past that I know of 
personally on the border of Texas and 
Mexico where people had come and 
been released. They found they had 
credible fear. They asserted it. They 
have legal status, and they want to go 
to a specific location where they have 
friends and family. In those cases, 
there is help given to them to reach 
those destinations. But it is not the 
current situation where the Governors 
of Florida, Texas, and Arizona are de-
ceiving these people onto these buses 
and sending them to places they have 
never heard of and not letting those 
who are in their destinations even 
know what it coming. 
What is the right thing to do? The 
right thing to do is what we did 8 years 
ago: a bipartisan approach to fixing the 
immigration system. Instead of ex-
ploiting it for political purposes, let’s 
fix it. 
We have done that. We passed legisla-
tion on a bipartisan basis even in this 
evenly divided Senate. The CHIPS 
bill—this 
important 
semiconductor 
chip production bill—was a bipartisan 
bill. The infrastructure bill—the big-
gest highway program in the history of 
the United States since Dwight Eisen-
hower—was a bipartisan bill. The gun 
safety bill—a controversial issue, just 
as controversial as immigration—we 
passed that on a bipartisan basis. We 
can do it, but we have to stop exploit-
ing these people who are here with 
children. We have to do it by stopping 
exploiting this issue and work together 
on a bipartisan basis, with give on both 
sides. That is how we can reach a bi-
partisan solution. 
I am ready to do that. In the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, we would start 
as soon as we have Republicans of good 
will willing to sit down with Demo-
crats and work together. But con-
tinuing to exploit these people and the 
children and these families is just plain 
wrong. It is not consistent with Amer-
ican values. It doesn’t reflect well on 
our Nation. 
I hope that the people who are in-
spired to do this—the Governors in 
Florida, Texas, and Arizona—will think 
twice about these kids and their fami-
lies before they try it again. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4834 
September 20, 2022 
I have to ask, has the President vis-
ited the border lately? Oh, that is 
right, he hasn’t. In fact, other than a 
driveby by the border when he was a 
candidate for Vice President—and by 
‘‘driveby,’’ I mean his motorcade lit-
erally drove by—the President has 
never visited the border. Never. Al-
though I have to say that even reading 
the news should be enough to make it 
clear to the President the situation at 
the border is neither safe, nor orderly, 
nor humane. 
In case the President isn’t clear 
about what is happening at the border, 
let me just read from one news story 
from last week. This one was from NBC 
News: 
A new surge of migrants . . . is over-
whelming the Border Patrol and shelters in 
El Paso, Texas, where nearly 1,000 have been 
released near bus stations over the past week 
in hope that they will find their own way to 
their next destinations in the U.S. 
Here is the title of another grim news 
article from last week: ‘‘Texas border 
town requests refrigerators to store 
migrant bodies after drownings over-
whelm mortuaries.’’ 
‘‘Texas border town requests refrig-
erators to store migrant bodies after 
drownings overwhelm mortuaries.’’ 
Yet another news outlet reported: 
El Paso County Sheriff sounds alarm over 
Border Patrol overwhelmed due to migrants. 
That article goes on to say: 
Sheriff Richard Wiles stated Thursday, 
‘‘This incident raises a law enforcement con-
cern because Border Patrol is so over-
whelmed, undocumented immigrants may be 
released into communities with minimal or 
no screening.’’ 
Does any of this—any of this—make 
the situation at the border sound safe 
or orderly or humane? I don’t think so. 
The Biden administration has been 
characterized by recordbreaking waves 
of 
illegal 
immigration 
across 
our 
southern border, and I mean ‘‘record-
breaking’’ quite literally. 
In fiscal year 2021, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection apprehended more 
than 1.7 million individuals attempting 
to cross our southern border illegally— 
the highest number of apprehensions 
ever recorded. As for fiscal year 2022, 
well, we exceeded last year’s record-
breaking number of apprehensions in 
June. The final count of apprehensions 
for fiscal year 2022 will be well over 2 
million. Those numbers only count mi-
grants who were actually apprehended. 
CBS News reports that there were ‘‘an 
estimated 660,000 successful unlawful 
border entries that did not end in an 
arrest in fiscal year 2021, according to 
unpublished [Department of Homeland 
Security] figures’’—660,000. 
I don’t have to tell anyone except 
maybe congressional Democrats and 
the White House that these kinds of 
numbers have resulted in scenes of 
near chaos at the southern border. 
Shelters have been overwhelmed. Bor-
der facilities have been overwhelmed. 
The Border Patrol has been over-
whelmed. Who can forget the scene of 
10,000 
migrants 
camped 
under 
the 
bridge in Del Rio, TX, last September? 
Just in case anyone is thinking 
things at the border have substantially 
calmed down, here is yet another head-
line from this month, this one from the 
Dallas Morning News: ‘‘Overcrowded 
processing center has Border Patrol re-
leasing more migrants on El Paso 
streets: Migrants are being released 
from facility filled at 3 times its capac-
ity.’’ 
That is from the Dallas Morning 
News—‘‘3 times its capacity.’’ 
Over the past few months, the Gov-
ernors of Texas and Arizona have been 
sending some illegal immigrants to 
places like New York City and Wash-
ington, DC, and there has been a pre-
dictable outcry. But what is so striking 
about this situation is how upset these 
places seem to have become when deal-
ing with just a tiny fraction of the sit-
uation that border communities and 
border States have to deal with on a 
daily basis. Washington, DC, declared a 
state of emergency. The New York City 
mayor was outraged. 
While I am in no way dismissing the 
challenges of dealing with thousands of 
illegal immigrants, let me just put this 
situation in perspective for a minute. 
Washington, DC, a city of around 
700,000 people, has received somewhere 
around 9,400 migrants over a span of 5 
months. New York City, a city of 
around 8.4 million people, hasn’t even 
received as many as Washington, DC. 
Compare that with the situation in 
Eagle Pass, TX, a town with a popu-
lation of just 29,000, which sees 10,000 
migrants a week—a week. 
For a party that likes to pride itself 
on compassion, the lack of compassion 
Democrats and the White House dis-
play on this issue is really astounding. 
Even after catching a tiny glimpse of 
what it is like to deal with an influx of 
illegal immigration, Democrats have 
apparently zero compassion for the 
border communities in States that 
have to somehow manage the arrival of 
thousands of illegal immigrants on a 
daily 
basis, 
along 
with 
all 
the 
logistical and security challenges that 
involves. 
There are real security challenges. 
Certainly, many of the migrants cross-
ing our southern border illegally are 
simply looking for a better life—even if 
they are trying to circumvent legal 
pathways to enter—but there are also a 
lot of potentially dangerous individ-
uals coming across our border and 
passing through border communities: 
gang members, drug traffickers, human 
smugglers, and other criminals. In 1 re-
cent week, Border Patrol agents in the 
Rio Grande Valley Sector along the 
southern border arrested 21 gang mem-
bers, 2 sex offenders, and 3 migrants 
with prior convictions for various 
crimes. 
The White House and Democrats 
don’t just display a lack of compassion 
for border communities; they also dis-
play a real lack of compassion for the 
individuals attempting to enter our 
country illegally. There is nothing 
compassionate about an immigration 
policy that encourages individuals to 
come here illegally, with all of the 
risks that entails. 
Earlier, I mentioned a border town 
that was seeking increased morgue fa-
cilities because it was dealing with the 
bodies of so many individuals who had 
drowned while attempting to enter this 
country. Deaths at the southern border 
have surged under the Biden adminis-
tration, undoubtedly because the ad-
ministration’s lax immigration policies 
and obvious lack of concern about se-
curing the border have encouraged in-
dividuals to attempt to come here ille-
gally. 
According to Department of Home-
land Security numbers that have been 
reported, 748 migrants have died at our 
southern border so far this fiscal year. 
That is a lot of lives lost, Mr. Presi-
dent—a lot of lives. Mr. President, one 
illegal immigrant speaking to a news 
outlet this month said of the border: 
It’s open, not closed. The border is open. 
. . . Everybody believes that the border is 
open. It’s open because we enter, we come in, 
free. No problem. 
That is the message that President 
Biden’s immigration policies have con-
veyed, and the longer that he continues 
with his de facto open-border policies, 
the more individuals who are going to 
be encouraged to attempt the dan-
gerous journey across our southern 
border. 
Mr. President, the massive spending 
package, the so-called Inflation Reduc-
tion 
Act, 
the 
Democrats 
shoved 
through the Senate last month con-
tained hundreds of billions for Demo-
crats’ Green New Deal priorities, like 
tax credits for wealthy Americans to 
buy electric cars and more than $80 bil-
lion for environmental justice prior-
ities. There was also, of course, an $80 
billion funding infusion for the IRS, a 
majority of it allocated for more IRS 
audits and increased enforcement, in-
cluding the hiring of additional IRS 
agents. Nowhere in that bill were there 
any resources for addressing the crisis 
that has been raging for more than a 
year now at our southern border. 
During debate on the bill, Repub-
licans gave Democrats five opportuni-
ties to vote for amendments aimed at 
providing resources to secure the bor-
der. Democrats rejected all of them. 
Apparently, Democrats are willing to 
spend a lot of time and effort and gov-
ernment money on their Green New 
Deal and finding new ways to collect 
taxpayer dollars to help fund their Big 
Government spending plans, but when 
it comes to protecting Americans and 
ensuring a humane situation at our 
southern border, Democrats just can’t 
be bothered. 
I heard the Democratic whip down 
here, just now, talking about that 
there just needs to be a comprehensive 
immigration bipartisan approach to 
this and blaming Republicans for them 
not being able to do anything to ad-
dress this issue. And I just have to say 
that, one, the Democrats control all of 
government in Washington. They have

the House, the Senate, and the White 
House, and, to my knowledge, they 
have not attempted to bring an immi-
gration reform bill to the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. Furthermore, the Presi-
dent reversed all of the policies from 
the previous administration that af-
fected the border when he took office. 
Now we have got a situation at our 
southern border that is just nothing 
short of appalling, and if the President 
really had any interest in making the 
process at the border ‘‘safe, orderly, 
and humane,’’ as he said the other day, 
he would make securing our southern 
border a priority, and it is not. Unfor-
tunately, given his record so far, I 
think it is more likely that we will see 
the scenes of chaos and human suf-
fering continue. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 
15 minutes prior to the scheduled roll-
call vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, since 
the Biden administration really likes 
to celebrate things, I rise today on the 
1-week anniversary of their party last 
Tuesday for their so-called Inflation 
Reduction Act. 
Last Tuesday, most Americans and, 
certainly, 
most 
West 
Virginians 
weren’t in a celebratory mood. West 
Virginians started their day with news 
that inflation rose to 8.3 percent in Au-
gust, while President Biden and his 
party and climate activists began set-
ting up for their Inflation Reduction 
Act party at the White House. 
Meanwhile, that same day, the U.S. 
stock market had its worst day since 
June 2020, as the White House and its 
fellow 
Democrats 
celebrated 
their 
green spending bill that would only ex-
tend inflationary pain, but it does ex-
pand U.S. and IRS enforcement on 
Americans who are struggling to afford 
basic necessities. 
Days after the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office published an anal-
ysis that the Inflation Reduction Act 
would actually not reduce inflation, 
particularly in the short term, Presi-
dent Biden announces that he will do 
student debt cancelation that would 
add another trillion dollars to the def-
icit. 
Today and tomorrow, the Federal Re-
serve, which is our U.S. monetary 
watchdog, is meeting to set new inter-
est rates in a bid to tame inflation. The 
body has had to raise interest rates ag-
gressively by three-quarters of a point. 
In June, Chairman Powell, who is the 
Chairman of the Fed, admitted that 
the rate increase is ‘‘unusually large’’ 
and would not be ‘‘common.’’ The Fed 
will likely raise interest rates again by 
the same amount tomorrow, for the 
third consecutive time in a row. These 
are the most aggressive rate increases 
since the 1980s, when my mortgage was 
way into the teens, that Chairman 
Powell has plainly stated will bring 
‘‘pain to households and businesses.’’ 
We can’t forget that the Democrats 
alone passed a bill last year that they 
called the American Rescue Plan, 
which rescued nothing and, instead, en-
dangered our fragile economy coming 
out of COVID by hypercharging infla-
tion. Democrats alone drafted and 
pushed forward their most recent bill, 
bypassing the normal committee proc-
ess, and Democrats alone passed it, re-
jecting every Republican amendment 
along the way. 
In short, these policies continue to 
destabilize every single corner of our 
economy. Well, how do we know this? 
We see some of the statistics that I 
talk about. Well, I know it because 
West Virginians have lived it, and I 
hear from them frequently about their 
legitimate concerns. A retiree from 
Clarksburg, WV, wrote to me recently 
saying that she and her husband are 
‘‘struggling every month’’ despite hav-
ing done their due diligence to save 
well for their retirement. She says 
they are trying not to dip into their 
401(k)s or their TSP retirement ac-
counts but that it is getting ‘‘harder 
and harder’’ not to do that. 
As inflation drags on, the lifespan of 
retirement 
savings 
will 
continue 
shrinking for our seniors in West Vir-
ginia, and those seniors account for 41 
percent of our population. 
Another West Virginian wrote to me 
about the tough choices her family is 
making: 
The economy has crumbled in the blink of 
an eye. My husband and I have full-time jobs 
and two children. I’m tearful because I sit 
here looking at upcoming bills and I’m hav-
ing to decide to pay a bill or buy groceries. 
A resident from Weston, WV, told me 
that his insurance premiums recently 
increased and, when he asked the com-
pany why that happened, they told him 
pointblank it was due to inflation. In 
the same letter, the constituent wrote: 
This crazy spending has to stop. 
But it is not just West Virginians 
who are experiencing this inflationary 
problem. The National Defense Indus-
trial Association, authored in part by 
former 
Deputy 
Defense 
Secretary 
David Norquist, released a white paper 
recently that indicated inflation has 
cost the Department of Defense $50 bil-
lion and estimates that it will cost an 
additional $110 billion to our Nation’s 
defense from fiscal year 2021 through 
fiscal year 2023. 
Think about this in the face of what 
we are talking about in terms of trying 
to help Ukraine overcome this terrible 
invasion by the Russians. 
Residential 
real 
estate 
has 
sky-
rocketed 43 percent in the past 2 years. 
In fact, this year, mortgage rates have 
risen from 3.2 percent to 6.3 percent, 
which is the highest they have been 
since 2008—setting all kinds of records 
here. So some are going so far as to 
predict an additional 17.8 percent rise 
in home prices over the next year. 
A recent paper released by Goldman 
Sachs, 
aptly 
titled 
‘‘The 
Housing 
Downturn: Further to Fall,’’ warns 
that higher mortgage rates and re-
duced affordability will continue well 
into 2023. For first-time home buyers, 
that spells a death knell for their 
dream of owning their own home. 
Again, 
what 
we 
are 
seeing 
in 
realtime are direct consequences of in-
flation fueled by spending. The in-
crease in the price of groceries is unbe-
lievable. It is unbelievable when you go 
to the grocery store. Over the past 
year, the price of basic pantry staples 
has continued to increase. The cost of 
eggs has gone up 40 percent; butter, 24.6 
percent; luncheon meats, 18.2 percent. 
Fresh milk has increased 17.7 percent. 
Sugar, flour, bread, pasta, peanut but-
ter, and cereals have increased between 
15 and 23 percent. These are the things 
that families buy weekly to meet their 
grocery bill and to provide their chil-
dren’s breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 
Simply put, elected Democrats in the 
Biden administration celebrated the 
so-called Inflation Reduction Act on a 
day when the Consumer Price Index on 
inflation increased. For the many con-
stituents whom I talk to on a daily 
basis, inflation remains the No. 1 con-
cern. 
So this irony is not lost on me nor is 
it lost on the American public. It is not 
lost on millions of Americans making 
tough choices because of these policies, 
and it is painful; it is hard to watch; 
and in many of my constituents’ opin-
ion, it is as if the President and his 
party are not paying attention. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the vote occur 
now. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

ENERGY 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to talk about how the current 
process that we are in right now with 
the energy challenges we have, not just 
in our country but around the world, 
and how the committee process, the 
committee process that we are working 
on, can help relieve the challenges that 
the American public have right now 
with high prices at the gas pump, high 
prices they are receiving in their 
homes for heating and all the neces-
sities they have. 
What is at risk right now—and I want 
people to understand. What is at risk is 
the energy independence and energy se-
curity of the United States of America. 
If we are going to remain the super-
power of the world, if we are one coun-
try that has it all, you better have en-
ergy independence. If you can’t produce 
your own energy and you are going to 
ask other people around the world to 
do what you won’t do for yourself but 
you have the ability to do it and the 
resources to do it, God help us all. That 
is what we are dealing with. 
So I am going to talk about how Con-
gress can provide some relief here. 
The 2022 Energy Independence and 
Security Act we have been working on 
is going to be paramount to maintain-
ing what we have. That means that we 
have to focus on not blaming each 
other. This has become a personal 
thing back and forth, back and forth. 
Some people on the extreme left—lib-
erals—don’t like it because they want 
many changes. We have some people in 
the conference over here, my Repub-
lican friends, who have always been for 
it, but now the leadership has made it 
personal to be against it. But let me 
tell you who suffers—it is all the peo-
ple. All the American citizens are 
going to suffer if we don’t do some-
thing. 
We are all citizens of this great coun-
try, and we are all so grateful for hav-
ing the opportunities we have by living 
here. But we have an abundant amount 
of energy—an abundant amount of en-
ergy that we can produce cleaner than 
anywhere else in the world. 
I 
have 
always 
said 
let’s 
do 
decarbonization. We all should be com-
mitted to decarbonize to help the at-
mosphere and to help the climate. That 
is our responsibility as human beings 
and especially in a developed nation in 
the developing world. 
Decarbonizing 
means 
two 
things, 
however you intend to interpret it. 
Some people want to decarbonize by 
basically eliminating anything that 
has fossil. Well, guess what. Our friends 
in Europe tried that. Our European 
friends tried that. Look where they 
are. 
Then there are those of us who want 
to basically say: We can decarbonize by 
producing more fossil, which is cleaner 
in the United States of America, and 
basically dispersing the dirty fossils 
produced around the world. That is all 
we are saying. 
When you have oil and gas coming 
from Venezuela, which is produced 
with no oversight whatsoever—dirtier 
than any place in the world—we were 
going to go to them and remove sanc-
tions to help us? That makes no sense. 
We were going to ask Iran, which is the 
most prolific terrorist supporter in the 
world, which made no sense whatso-
ever. When we are asking Saudi Arabia 
to please produce more oil to help us— 
no support—it makes no sense at all. 
So this is what we are talking about. 
I have this item here that kind of 
spells out what we are confirming. 
Here 
is 
the 
common 
permitting 
timelines for energy and minerals 
projects. The timeline for the United 
States is a minimum of 5 to 10 years— 
a minimum of 5 to 10 years; Canada, 1 
to 3 years; Australia, 1 to 3 years, and 
they haven’t deleted any of their over-
sight for review. They haven’t deleted 
any of that. 
Now let me tell you the extremes 
that are going on in the world today. 
The European Union, which has had a 
pretty stringent oversight on environ-
ment, they are considering emergency 
bypassing all environmental reviews 
because it is critical to them. Energy 
has been weaponized by Putin. Energy 
has been weaponized, and we in Amer-
ica can offset that. We can. 
No matter what you want to build, 
whether it is transmission, pipelines, 
hydropower dams, more often than not, 
it takes too long. It drives up cost. You 
can double your cost within a 5- to 6-, 
7-year period, double from what the 
original cost may be in projected cost. 
Today’s energy and mineral projects, 
as I have said before, take too long. 
Then you come over here, look basi-
cally at what the U.S. citizens—all 330 
million people—are subjected to. Nat-
ural gas, up 200 percent. The cost of 
natural gas, 200 percent. The cost of 
natural gas in Europe, 1,100-percent in-
crease—1,100 percent. Predicted by next 
year, some utility—homes will be pay-
ing $7,000 a month. They are going to 
be subsidized by the government; they 
can’t do that forever. Can you imagine 
those types of outrageous costs? Gaso-
line. Gasoline is up 67 percent, under 
both this administration and previous 
administration—67 percent. Electricity 
is up 15 percent and climbing and 
climbing. 
When you have countries, such as 
Australia and Canada, that are doing it 
and doing it in a clean fashion but also 
doing it in an accelerated fashion, that 
is something we should be looking at. 
We have talked about permitting for 
years and years and years. If you are 
on the renewable side and you want all 
renewable, no fossil whatsoever, you 
can’t get a transmission line done. If 
you are going to build a wind farm or 
a solar farm in the middle of the desert 
where there are no people and you have 
got a build to take the electrons, take 
that electricity back into the market-
place, you have got to cross a mul-
titude of State lines. 
You have got to have permitting re-
form to get it done. You are not going 
to be able to deliver the energy that 
people need. Look at our friends, 
whether it be in California or look at 
what has happened in Texas—all this. 
It is very, very fragile what is going 
on. 
But then the good news is, next week, 
we are going to have an opportunity to 
help accelerate these energy projects 
clear across the country and the needs 
that we all have, if we don’t let politics 
get in the way. If we basically look at 
what the United States of America 
needs, what the people in this country 
need, and what they want to make sure 
that we have the energy independence 
to do it ourselves and not rely on for-
eign supply chains, that is what it is 
about. 
I have always said, if I can go home 
and explain it, if I can talk to all of 
you and explain it, I can vote for it; I 
can explain what we are doing. I truly 
can—whether it be from the IRA, a bill 
that basically gives us a pathway to 
walk and chew gum, provide the energy 
we need for today but also invest in the 
energy we need in the future. We are 
doing both, but you can’t do them un-
less you have permitting reform. 
Now, everyone thinks this is a side 
deal. There is no side deal. We talked 
about all of this at one time. We put 
this project together under one auspice 
of energy independence and the secu-
rity this Nation needs and the relief 
the citizens need from high inflation— 
that is what—and also the support that 
we need for our allies in Europe that 
are having a difficult time. 
So let me lay out the facts and ex-
plain why voting for energy permitting

September 20, 2022 
reform is something that should make 
sense to each and every one of my col-
leagues on both my Republican side 
and Democrat side. Put plainly, with 
the state of energy prices, our con-
stituents across the country, they 
can’t afford for the politics to stand in 
the way of a long overdue, bipartisan 
action on energy permitting reform. 
Domestically, American families and 
businesses are feeling the pain. This is 
Putin’s energy war. I won’t acknowl-
edge this as a Russian war. This is one 
demagogue who basically has brought 
the havoc and the unrest that we have 
in the world—one man, Putin—and he 
has basically weaponized energy like 
we have never seen and never thought 
would be done, and this must be an-
swered. We have the infrastructure, 
and we have the resources. I have said 
that before. 
American natural gas prices average 
around $9 per million of Btu—$9 per 
million. I mean, most of this energy 
comes from my State of West Vir-
ginia—a lot of the gas does—because 
we have the Marcellus and Utica shale, 
which are probably the richest deposits 
of natural gas that we have ever seen 
in this country, let alone the world. 
But with that, those prices were in the 
$2.50 to $3 range. It balances out pretty 
well to $5, but at $9 it does not. 
Look at what the Europeans are pay-
ing. The Europeans are paying an as-
tronomical $60 and $70 equivalent to 
the same MCF—$60 to $70 versus our $9, 
which we think is outrageous. This is 
the crunch that we are in. 
Even with the cost savings that we 
have achieved by energy efficiency, 
electricity and home energy costs are 
up, and Americans are concerned about 
reliability after watching things that 
are taking a heck of a hit right now. 
The changing energy mix has not 
yielded affordability for American fam-
ilies 
evenly, 
in 
part, 
because 
we 
haven’t been able to knit together the 
widespread 
resources 
with 
trans-
mission and the delivery of this energy. 
That is the hardest thing we have. You 
can only do that by building more in-
frastructure. You can’t do it by hoping 
one skips over another to get you what 
you need. You have got to have infra-
structure for this transmission to pipe-
lines to get you the energy you need. 
The consumer price index tells the 
story. Consumers paid 16 percent more 
for their electricity service and 33 per-
cent more for their gas services, and it 
is only going to get worse, not better. 
Absolutely. 
I am grateful that we have made 
progress addressing the price at the 
pump. As we said, a gallon of gasoline 
remains 67 percent higher than it did 5 
years ago. These are the type of pock-
etbook issues—they truly are—that are 
impacting day-to-day decisions Ameri-
cans make. People are making deci-
sions on how they are going to get 
from one day to the next, one month to 
the next, and what will happen next 
year. They are making those decisions. 
They are making them when the gas 
prices are still too high, when the en-
ergy prices are absolutely too high, and 
the unrest from supply chains is mak-
ing it almost impossible to do the 
things or have the things you need or 
that you want. 
I have heard my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle propose a variety of 
solutions to address the rising costs of 
energy 
for 
American 
consumers, 
whether it be through more oil or gas, 
a switch to electric vehicles. Let me 
ask you, Mr. President, where do they 
think the electricity comes from if 
they buy an electric vehicle? It has got 
to be produced. It has got to be pro-
duced. You have got California, I am 
understanding they are saying they 
want all-electric vehicles by a certain 
date; yet they are telling people you 
can’t charge your car at certain times 
of the day. Something doesn’t make 
sense. We have to be realistic, be prac-
tical about this, pragmatic. All those 
things are going to take Federal per-
mits for us to make sure they have the 
energy they need. We are going to have 
to face this sooner or later. 
It is only possible if you can build it. 
If you can build it, then you can make 
sure that we have the changes that 
consumers are going to demand in 
America. If we can make those, then, 
fine; we can supply it. If we can’t, I 
guarantee the chaos will be unbeliev-
able for all of us who represent these 
great people. 
Our producers are handcuffed by an 
arduous 
permitting 
process 
that 
doesn’t allow us to meet the supply 
problems that we are facing, and it is 
not getting any better. 
Let me kind of throw the political 
process that we have out. My Repub-
lican friends have always been very 
supportive, always; and I have a lot of 
my Democrat friends who understand 
that we need permitting reform. But 
we have never gotten it done, whether 
we have had all Democrats in charge, 
whether it be the President being a 
Democrat, the House and Senate being 
Democrat controlled, or whether it was 
4 years ago when you had the Repub-
licans who basically had a Republican 
President and Senate and the House 
and they couldn’t get it done. You can 
only get it done if we work together. 
We can only get this done if our Repub-
lican colleagues and our Democrat col-
leagues work together. It won’t hap-
pen. And if we don’t do it now, in my 
lifetime and a lot of my colleagues’ 
lifetimes, it is not going to happen in 
our lifetime. It is not. 
If we continue to strap the American 
people with the highest cost of delivery 
of the products they need because of 
our infrastructure and the cost of in-
frastructure, we end up doubling and 
tripling the price because of the own-
er’s position we put them in to go 
through a process of permitting, and 
they know that going in, up front, that 
cost is passed on. They don’t absorb 
that cost. 
So if a pipeline costs $3 billion— 
which you anticipate to build a pipe-
line, to deliver the energy you have, 
whether it be hydrogen or whether it 
be natural gas, and that ends up cost-
ing you $6 billion or $7 billion—you and 
I pay that price. Every one of our con-
stituents in our States pays that price. 
We are suffering from self-inflicted 
shortages. We are anticipating short-
ages right now. The next 5 years, basi-
cally, our gas supplies, our gas deposits 
are down—natural gas. Natural gas is 
down. And we can change that. We can 
change that because the energy we 
have under our feet right now, if we 
can just get it to the market, it will 
not only fulfill the surpluses that we 
have, it will basically be able to help 
our allies across the globe here that 
need it most. 
The worst scenario is if the Ukraine 
war and the pressure that that war is 
putting on energy that goes into Eu-
rope—and the Europeans are facing 
some absolutely astronomical hard-
ships—and those hardships reflect to 
where they are putting pressure on 
Ukraine to make a deal with Putin, 
God help the world. God help us all if 
Putin walks away and can say he had a 
victory. He has a propaganda machine 
that he can say anything he wants, no 
matter the devastating losses that he 
has taken with his troops and the eco-
nomic challenges he has in his country, 
but the unbelievable carnage and pain 
he has put on Ukraine; and they are 
going to be forced because of energy to 
make a decision. We can help that and 
prevent that from every happening. 
That is what we should be doing. That 
is basically the challenge that we have. 
So you either rise to the challenge or 
you don’t. You either put your politics 
aside, forget about your personal ven-
dettas and your personal arguments, 
whatever—look at the contents of the 
bill. Look at what we are going to have 
in front of us that you can vote on; 
that you can make a difference. I have 
often said, if you can go home and ex-
plain it, you can vote for it; and I truly 
believe this piece of legislation will do 
that. 
We are putting people to make hard 
choices; they shouldn’t be put in that 
position. I tell Americans every day I 
speak to them, I say: Don’t let Wash-
ington make you believe you are di-
vided. You are not divided; we are di-
vided here. 
We are forcing the constituents of 
our States to pick a side. What side are 
you on? There is only one side; that is 
the American side. There is not an-
other side. 
We have Republican friends and 
Democratic friends; we might have dif-
ferent ideas. But when the country is 
challenged, we have one problem to 
solve, and that is what we are working 
on right now. You can come with dif-
ferent ideas, and we can go through the 
whole process, but we should come to-
gether. You shouldn’t say: Well, my 
side is right, and we are against that; 
my side is right because we are for it. 
Well, we both have to be. 
If this doesn’t pass, nothing moves on 
permitting unless we work together. If

all the Democrats vote for it, it is not 
enough. If all the Republicans voted for 
it, it is not enough. The Senate is 
unique; it takes 60. So it is going to 
take 10 or more from one side or the 
other, and right now I would say our 
Republican friends and colleagues are 
going to have to look deeply at some-
thing that they have always wanted 
and have a chance in their hands to 
grab but let politics come between us. 
I hope not; I don’t think so. I am still 
betting on the right thing will be done 
at the right time. 
I understand that the political proc-
ess we are in is highly charged. I am 
hoping that the American public basi-
cally says: Enough is enough. Come on. 
It is for the country. It is not for you. 
It is not to make your party stronger 
or to make the other one look bad. It 
is not to give one an advantage over 
the other. 
This process is to fix the problems to 
keep this country the strongest coun-
try on Earth, keep us basically the su-
perpower of the world, and we only 
have one way to do it. We are doing ev-
erything we can for ourselves. I guar-
antee, when you are able to do that, 
you are able to draw your allies closer 
to you. The people want to be associ-
ated with the winner; they want to be 
associated with an economy that you 
can’t stop and with a quality of life 
that is next to none. That is what they 
want to be associated with. And the 
American dream can be alive. It can 
only be alive if we do everything to 
keep it vibrant. So that is what we are 
working on. 
Less than a year ago, we acted—Con-
gress did—in a bipartisan way to accel-
erate public works permitting in the 
infrastructure bill. Now, we did it for 
infrastructure. We finally came to-
gether and said, for the last 30 years, 
we have known that our roads and 
bridges and our pipelines and our inter-
net service, everything needed to be 
improved, and we voted in a bipartisan 
way. And do you know what we did? We 
changed how we did the permitting to 
get those things to fruition, to build a 
road or a bridge. But yet we can’t do it 
for energy. It doesn’t make any sense 
to me at all why we can’t do it for en-
ergy, but we were able to do it for in-
frastructure. 
In the coming days, we are going to 
have that opportunity to take the ac-
tion to move the needle on getting 
types of energy and critical minerals— 
try getting a permit for a mine in crit-
ical minerals. You know we just passed 
a bill, the IRA bill, that basically says, 
on the car manufacturing, car manu-
facturing, we want to get people 
transitioned; electric vehicles should 
be desirable. You either like the prod-
uct or you don’t, but you will make 
those decisions. The only thing about 
it, the only way you are going to get a 
credit is if the manufacturers are 
sourcing the critical minerals from ei-
ther North America or favored nations, 
such as Australia and our European 
friends, not those—and right now, all 
of it is coming from China. China has a 
lock on this. So it is time we decide to 
get off our butts and start doing what 
we should be doing for ourselves so we 
don’t have to be crippled by a supply 
chain. 
You know, I have told everybody, I 
said the first time in the history of the 
United States of America—think about 
this great country, Henry Ford, the 
mass production line—we have been 
able to produce in the United States of 
America, without any foreign supply 
chains that were needed, the combus-
tible engine, all the drive trains, and 
everything else it took for transpor-
tation mode. We were able to do that, 
whether it be for trains, planes, or 
automobiles. Guess what. Now they 
have come out and said we are going to 
VEDS, electric vehicles. 
For the first time in the history of 
the United States, we cannot produce 
what is needed for that to be a trans-
portation mode. 
I refuse to give up and say we can’t 
do it. That is why, in the bill that we 
pass, you are going to have to source 
the critical minerals that are needed 
for the batteries that are going to be 
supplying the power for these vehicles, 
and they are going to have to be pro-
duced in North America. 
We shouldn’t be waiting on the for-
eign supply chains to say: Oh, I am 
sorry. We don’t agree with your geo-
political stance on so many things, so 
we are not going to agree to give you 
what you need. We process the anodes 
and cathodes that make these bat-
teries, but that is all China. It is not 
us. And we are not going to get caught 
in that. So that is what we are trying 
to correct. 
In the coming days, we are going to 
have this opportunity, and I say that 
again—truly an opportunity. We can 
keep the costs down. We can make it 
affordable. We can relieve the pain at 
the pump. We can relieve the pain 
when you see your energy bills being 
mailed to you every month. We can 
fight all of this. 
We can unlock the energy and cli-
mate benefits of the Energy Act of 2020. 
The bipartisan infrastructure law and 
the inflation reduction—we can do all 
of that, but you can’t do it in a timely 
fashion to meet the challenges the 
world has today unless you change per-
mitting, which is something we have 
all wanted. 
It streamlines the electric trans-
mission lines. I don’t know what to tell 
you. As of right now, there are approxi-
mately 
20 
interstate 
transmission 
projects in various stages of planning— 
20. Those take, right now, an average 
of 10 years. On top of that, a quarter of 
those—25 percent of those—go into liti-
gious 
extensions, 
which 
is 
even 
longer—15, 17 years, some of them. 
There is nobody in the developed world 
looking at us, saying we are effective 
and efficient and what we are doing is 
delivering the most effective and effi-
cient pricing that we can and the most 
reliable energy that is needed. 
In this permitting bill, we do not by-
pass any of the oversights from envi-
ronmental review. Whatever we have in 
place is still there. We are just going to 
put in guidelines and timetables: You 
either do it in a sufficient amount of 
time or we move on. So that is what we 
are doing. And we are simultaneously 
going to two or three Agencies at the 
same time. 
All we did is look at what was suc-
cessful around the world—that is all we 
did—and we made it applicable to what 
we are trying to do here so that we can 
compete on an even playing field, and 
we are going to continue to do that. 
This bill isn’t just my idea. Everyone 
says it is a personal thing; it is my 
idea. This bill is not my idea. This bill 
is a combination of everybody in this 
body. 
Also, the challenges we have right 
now—the war in Europe has acceler-
ated everything. The inflation has ac-
celerated the need to do something 
quickly. If we don’t get off our prover-
bial hind ends and start acting like 
Americans and not Republicans or 
Democrats fighting for our respective 
sides—you know, I see it. We have spec-
tators here watching what we are 
doing. We have people watching what 
we are doing. They have to be sick and 
tired that all we do is call each other 
names. 
Every Republican over there, I con-
sider them a friend, every one of the 50, 
and every one of my 49 colleagues I 
consider a friend. I don’t have all the 
answers, and they are not always 
wrong. Somewhere in between, we can 
find an answer to the problems. That is 
what we are asking for, and I am going 
to continue to do that. I am not giving 
up, and I won’t give up. 
We have an opportunity. Let’s take 
advantage of it. If we don’t, then you 
have to go home and explain why not. 
I don’t have to worry about that be-
cause I know why I am for this, and I 
know why I think it will help every 
person in my State of West Virginia 
and every one of my fellow Americans 
in this country. I really do. 
I hope we rise to this occasion. We 
are going to find out next week. We 
don’t have much time to wait now. We 
will find out where we stand. If there 
are people willing to vote to shut down 
this government because of political 
reasons—they don’t like permitting 
when it is something they fought for 
all their life, political life—they have 
to answer to that. 
With that being said, I appreciate 
very much the opportunity to be able 
to speak on this subject because I 
think it is so important. It is coming 
down to the point to where—we have 
great legislation. We have done a lot of 
bipartisan things, worked on good stuff 
these past 2 years, unbelievable. Now 
you want to make sure that you take 
advantage of that and bring it to the 
market quicker. You want to make 
sure you get the prices down; you fight 
inflation; you show the rest of the 
world that you can depend on the

AMENDMENT TO MONTREAL PRO-
TOCOL (‘‘KIGALI AMENDMENT’’) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the treaty. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Calendar No. 2, Treaty Document No. 117– 
1, Amendment to Montreal Protocol (‘‘Kigali 
Amendment’’). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5503 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I call 
up amendment No. 5503. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHUMER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 5503 to 
the resolution of ratification. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent to dispense with further reading of 
the amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 5503) is as fol-
lows: 
(Purpose: To add an effective date) 
At the end add the following: 
SEC. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
This resolution of ratification shall take 
effect on the date that is 1 day after ratifica-
tion. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak to the Kigali Amendment 
to the Montreal Protocol. 
I thank the leader for bringing this 
important legislative initiative to the 
Senate floor, and I want to thank our 
Republican colleagues who have joined 
in a bipartisan effort to send a very 
strong message that this is about 
America’s 
competitiveness; 
this 
is 
about America’s security; this is about 
challenging China. 
For more than 20 years, U.S. manu-
facturers have been hard at work pio-
neering new technologies for our refrig-
erators and air-conditioners. They de-
fined the global standard, and they 
have the competitive advantage over 
companies in China and India which 
have doubled down on yesterday’s tech-
nology. 
Our companies want and need the 
Senate to support them so that they 
can continue to lead, to create jobs, 
and to export their goods to global 
markets. 
So this is why I come to the floor 
today, to urge my Senate colleagues to 
provide advice and consent to the 
Kigali Amendment, the fifth technical 
update to the incredibly successful 
Montreal Protocol, a treaty amend-
ment that passed the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee by bipartisan 
voice vote—a bipartisan voice vote. 
That just shows the depth and scope of 
bipartisan support. Each of the four 
prior updates were approved by the full 
Senate with overwhelming bipartisan 
support, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same for Kigali. 
The amendment is a success story of 
business and government working to-
gether, dating back to the George W. 
Bush Administration. It is an update 
that will ensure U.S. leadership in ex-
ports into the future, and it is the only 
way—the only way—to keep our busi-
nesses from being locked out of mar-
kets across the world. 
American businesses are clear. It is 
time to phase down antiquated chemi-
cals, known as HFCs, which American 
manufacturers want to leave behind. It 
is time to usher in a new era in which 
the modern products are purchased all 
over the world. 
Our companies already lead in this 
space. They have been investing bil-
lions of dollars to develop new tech-
nologies—alternatives 
to 
HFCs—and 
they have done so in ways that will ul-
timately 
decrease 
costs—decrease 
costs—for U.S. consumers. That is why, 
for the time being, we have the com-
petitive advantage over China and oth-
ers. 
So the choice on this is clear: Ratify-
ing Kigali means ensuring U.S. compa-
nies dominate the export markets. 
Failure to ratify means a wasted in-
vestment and a missed opportunity. 
Ratifying means we will see thousands 
more domestic manufacturing jobs— 
33,000, according to industry estimates. 
Failure to ratify means U.S. businesses 
that employ tens of thousands of peo-
ple across the country will not—will 
not—be able to sell many of their prod-
ucts in key countries. We are talking 
about $4.8 billion annually—annually—

of increased exports; $12.5 billion of in-
creased economic output per year. So 
do we want billions of dollars a year in 
more exports and economic output or 
do we want to have lost jobs? Do we 
want lost exports? Do we want our 
companies suffering needlessly? 
Beginning in 2033, the nations all 
around the world that have already 
joined Kigali—137 of them and counting 
that have already done this—will be re-
quired—required—to block the imports 
of most HFCs from the countries that 
have not joined Kigali. So we would be 
blocked if we don’t, in fact, ratify this 
amendment. 
We don’t want U.S. manufacturers to 
be on the outside looking in. They em-
ploy thousands of people all over the 
country. We don’t want them to be un-
able to sell products that they had 
been at the forefront of developing. 
Adopting this treaty amendment is the 
only way to keep our businesses from 
being locked out of global markets. 
So let’s not waste the engagement 
and encouragement by the Bush admin-
istration that led U.S. manufacturers 
to develop alternatives to these harm-
ful chemicals. Let’s not waste the ac-
complishments made by the AIM Act, 
which President Trump signed into 
law. We need to remember that the 
AIM Act provides for the exact same 
chemical 
phasedown 
required 
by 
Kigali, which means that we have al-
ready taken the required steps domes-
tically. 
This means that we wouldn’t be re-
quired to do anything more—anything 
more—if we ratify Kigali, but we will 
miss out on billions in exports and 
thousands of jobs if we fail to do so. 
That is the essence. That is why 
manufacturers all over the country in 
States like Wisconsin, Texas, and Ken-
tucky 
support 
Senate 
approval 
of 
Kigali. That is why there has been an 
outpouring of support from the busi-
ness community, including major em-
ployers like Walmart, Carrier, Trane, 
Lennox, and others. 
That is why the National Association 
of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, and the impacted indus-
tries all support this practical and bi-
partisan Senate action. 
So, in closing, I ask my colleagues to 
fulfill our constitutional role in the 
treaty process by providing advice and 
consent to the Kigali Amendment. 
That requires 67 votes. I think we are 
well on our way there. Let’s support 
American businesses. Let’s continue to 
be the global leader. Let’s support 
American consumers. Let’s make sure 
the United States stays ahead of the 
competition. And let’s beat China, in-
stead of help China, at the end of the 
day. We can do all of that and so much 
more by adopting today’s amendment. 
And I want to thank so many who 
have worked on this in a bipartisan ef-
fort. Senator KENNEDY has been work-
ing very hard. I want to thank my col-
league Senator CARPER, the chairman 
of the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, who has been so passionate 
about the Kigali Amendment and such 
a force to bring us to this moment 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while he 
is still here on the floor, I just want to 
express to Senator MENENDEZ, my 
thanks, our thanks, to him and others 
on the Foreign Relations Committee 
for his leadership and for setting us up 
for great success—American businesses 
up 
for 
extraordinary 
success 
here 
today. The path is clear. We need to 
use some common sense and work to-
gether, and I think we will benefit from 
that and so will the men and women 
who have sent us here to serve them 
and to represent them. 
Mr. President, I rise today in support 
of ratification of the Kigali Amend-
ment to the Montreal Protocol. 
I have worn many hats throughout 
my life of public service, including 
naval flight officer, State Treasurer, 
Congressman, Governor, and a U.S. 
Senator. Today, I rise to speak from 
my heart as a recovering Governor, if 
you will. 
During my 8 years as Governor of 
Delaware, I realized quickly that my 
job was not to create jobs. That is not 
why they elected me. Rather, it was to 
help provide a nurturing environment 
for job creation—to help create a nur-
turing environment for job creation. 
More jobs were created in the 8 years 
that I was Governor of Delaware, I am 
told, than any other 8-year period in 
the history of the State of Delaware. I 
didn’t create one of them, but we did 
work very hard with the legislature 
and with the business community and 
others to create a nurturing environ-
ment that made possible extraordinary 
job creation. 
The most successful economic devel-
opment policies were the policies that 
provided business with long-term cer-
tainty and predictability. As it turns 
out, that is not unique to Delaware or 
to New Jersey or to Connecticut or any 
other State represented here. It is 
something that we still hear from busi-
nesses across the country in all 50 
States, and I am sure my other col-
leagues hear that message, too, on a 
regular basis. 
That is why I am so passionate about 
working with our friend and colleague 
Senator JOHN NEELY KENNEDY to ratify 
the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal 
Protocol. 
During the Trump administration, 
we successfully enacted the American 
Innovation and Manufacturing Act, 
known as the AIM Act, which phases 
down HFCs in accordance with the 
Kigali Amendment. 
Ratification of the Kigali Amend-
ment, along with implementation of 
the AIM Act, will provide businesses 
with certainty and with the predict-
ability that they need for future in-
vestments. 
Ratification will unleash billions of 
dollars in U.S. economic benefits—bil-
lions of dollars in U.S. economic bene-
fits—and create some 150,000 American 
jobs by 2027. 
I am going to repeat that. Ratifica-
tion will unleash billions of dollars in 
U.S. economic benefits and create some 
150,000 American jobs by 2027. These 
jobs are jobs in my State. These are 
jobs in every other State throughout 
our country. Why would we ever pass 
up this opportunity? 
Let me be clear to my colleagues. I 
am not the one telling industry that 
ratification of the Kigali Amendment 
is good for business and economic 
growth. No, I am not telling them that. 
Industry leaders are telling us that 
Kigali is good for their businesses. Ev-
eryone from the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce to the American Chemistry 
Council, to the Air-Conditioning, Heat-
ing, and Refrigeration Institute, to the 
Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric 
Policy support ratification for Kigali. 
In fact, it is hard to find anyone in the 
business community who is opposed to 
ratification. 
I would like to share with my col-
leagues today one statement that I 
think is particularly noteworthy from 
the National Association of Manufac-
turers. Here is what they have to say 
on this score: 
Kigali ratification will protect American 
workers, grow the economy, and improve our 
trade balance all while encouraging further 
innovation to strengthen America’s tech-
nology leadership. If we work together—if we 
rise above politics and partisanship and 
focus on solving problems—we can make our 
vision of a brighter tomorrow into reality. 
But for my colleagues who are still 
hesitant to support the Kigali ratifica-
tion and worried that ratification may 
hurt, not help, global competitiveness, 
here are a few points I would like for 
you to think about before tomorrow’s 
vote. 
First, I have heard concerns that 
ratification might benefit China and 
hurt the United States. Nothing could 
be further from the truth. While the 
United States contributes roughly $40 
million annually to the Montreal Pro-
tocol’s financial assistance programs, 
which facilitate the transition to next- 
generation technologies, it is not true 
that this assistance goes solely to 
China. 
In fact, China only receives a very 
small fraction of these funds. Accord-
ing to the U.S. heating, ventilation, 
air-conditioning, and refrigeration in-
dustry, financial assistance to China 
under the Montreal Protocol supports 
less than 2 percent of China’s $37 bil-
lion refrigerant market—less than 2 
percent of China’s $37 billion refrig-
erant market. Moreover, China’s share 
of these funds is decreasing, not in-
creasing. In fact, funding to China 
under the Montreal Protocol has de-
creased—has decreased—by nearly 70 
percent in recent years. 
Mr. President, the truth is, the small 
amount we pay every year under the 
Montreal Protocol is worth the invest-
ment and then some. Through Kigali

September 20, 2022 
ratification, American businesses are 
set to gain nearly $40 billion—$40 bil-
lion—in economic benefits by 2027, ac-
cording to a 2018 study by the Univer-
sity of Maryland. Ratifying Kigali will 
guarantee that American businesses 
continue to have access to inter-
national markets for refrigerants long 
into the future. 
However, without ratification, Amer-
ican companies could lose full access to 
international markets for refrigerants 
after 2033, closing the door to billions 
in future economic opportunities for 
U.S. companies. Why would we want to 
allow that to happen? 
Ratification also protects U.S. busi-
ness investments. While China has dou-
bled down on HFCs and the production 
of HFCs, a dumping of HFCs—and to 
this day illegally dumping HFCs into 
this country—the United States leads 
the world, I am proud to say—it leads 
the world in HFC alternatives. Ratifi-
cation would protect against the illegal 
HFC dumping and smuggling. These 
are protections that U.S. businesses 
have sought. 
I have also heard fears that ratifying 
the Kigali Amendment will somehow 
raise consumer costs. That is just not 
true. We are already transitioning 
away from HFCs similar to the way we 
transitioned away from ozone-deplet-
ing substances through the 1987 Mon-
treal Protocol under President Rea-
gan’s leadership. 
With the transition away from HFCs, 
we expect consumer costs to fall. Now, 
why is that? New refrigerants and re-
lated products run more efficiently. 
According to the EPA, use of HFC al-
ternatives will save consumers and 
businesses billions of dollars in costs. 
Again, ratification means lower costs 
for consumers and for businesses while 
enhancing U.S. competition. 
In closing, I hope our colleagues will 
join Senator KENNEDY and me in sup-
porting the ratification of the Kigali 
Amendment. This is a treaty that fos-
ters job creation—a lot of jobs. This is 
a 
treaty 
that 
promotes 
economic 
growth. This is a treaty that strength-
ens American leadership. This is a 
treaty of ‘‘Made in America,’’ not 
‘‘Made in China.’’ 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NDAA 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is 
this old document that no one reads 
anymore called the Constitution, and I 
think some of my colleagues should 
give it another read today. 
The Constitution tells us what Con-
gress is supposed to be doing here in 
DC, and that is national defense. It is 
right there at the top. Now, some of 
my colleagues don’t agree with it. 
They don’t have that as the No. 1 con-
cern. I think the majority do, but there 
are some who don’t. 
I would say this: For 61 years now, 
for 61 years in a row, Congress has ful-
filled this duty by passing the National 
Defense Authorization Act to strength-
en the common defense and support our 
troops. That is 61 years. That is a long 
track record. And this year will be my 
62nd, and I am proud to say that I have 
had the opportunity to vote on over 
half of them in that timeframe. So I 
think I have a pretty good under-
standing of what it takes to get this 
bill done and the significance of this 
bill. 
The way this typically works is the 
House does their bill; then the Senate 
does ours; and then we go into con-
ference and create a bipartisan, bi-
cameral conference report. That is 
commonly, normally what takes place. 
But that takes time. It really takes 
months. You know I have been in a po-
sition of being active in this for a long 
period of time. So when I look at the 
legislative calendar right now, I get 
concerned. The days are ticking down, 
and, frankly, we are running out of 
time to get this bill done, to do it the 
right way, and we are talking about 
the most important bill that we con-
sider all year. Now, some people don’t 
agree with that, but I certainly do. 
This tells us our ability to defend and 
help America to survive. 
Senator REED and I believe deeply in 
this bill. We held a markup on June 15 
and reported out a strong bipartisan 
bill. That was 3 months ago. Now, we 
have got an election in November that 
will likely eat away at the limited 
time that we have. 
We saw last year what happens when 
this bill isn’t given enough floor time. 
Last year, Majority Leader SCHUMER 
waited until the last possible moment 
to try to jam through the NDAA, the 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
without debate right before Thanks-
giving. If he delays it again, we don’t 
get an open amendment process where 
every Senator has a chance to improve 
the bill. Now, we are talking about 
every Senator—not just the members 
of the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee but all the others who are out 
there who have an interest in how to 
make this a better bill. 
We 
have 
a 
virtually 
unlimited 
amendments process that we have en-
joyed in the past. Now, if he delays, we 
get 
jammed 
in 
negotiating 
a 
conferenced bill with the House. The 
whole process would take longer, which 
leaves our military with more uncer-
tainty and prevents them from moving 
out and getting things done. There are 
real consequences to waiting this long. 
It is bad for this institution. It is bad 
for our troops. It is bad for our na-
tional security. 
Now, I understand some of my col-
leagues, including the majority leader, 
have different priorities than I do, but 
I think this is the most important bill 
that we do all year. So this year, that 
is as true as ever. We have threats. We 
have two countries out there, Russia 
and China; they have capabilities that 
we never believed they had, and some 
capabilities are better than ours. 
Now, people have this assumption— 
when I go out to Oklahoma or any-
where around the country and I talk 
about what we are doing here and ex-
plain to them that we have other coun-
tries out there, we have threats that 
are there, most people now agree that 
we are in the most threatened position 
that we have been in in a long period of 
time and the scope of threats that we 
have. 
Senator REED and I deeply believe in 
this bill because it responds to those 
threats and it takes care of our troops. 
We finished markup 3 months ago. We 
could have gotten started—we could 
have been finished by now. 
I have to admit, Mr. President, that 
I have a selfish motive. Now, how many 
Members of this body are going to 
stand up and admit they have a selfish 
motive, other than me? And that mo-
tive is that I want to get this bill done 
because it will be the last national de-
fense authorization bill of my career. I 
want to make sure it is done right. I 
would hate to leave here without fin-
ishing the NDAA, without fulfilling our 
promises to our troops and the Amer-
ican people. I would hate even more to 
see the bill’s six-decade track record 
broken. For the last 4 years as chair-
man and now ranking member of the 
Armed Services Committee, I have 
fought tirelessly to pass this bill. 
I know the majority leader doesn’t 
want to be responsible for the demise 
of Congress’s last remaining annual au-
thorization bill. There is really no time 
to waste. We are out of time now. The 
Senate is going to have to do, now, the 
NDAA. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore (Ms. 
SINEMA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
to seek consent to advance the nomina-
tion 
of 
a 
Virginian 
and 
friend, 
Leopoldo Martinez, to be Executive Di-
rector of the Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank. The IDB is the largest 
source of development financing for 
Latin America and the Caribbean. It is 
a critical part of the ability of the 
United States to engage diplomatically 
with our American partners to counter 
a growing influence of Russia and 
China and Iran and other nations in the 
Americas. And it is very much in the 
national interest of the United States

to build up economic prosperity of 
countries in the Western Hemisphere. 
We have seen over and over that 
when countries have troubled econo-
mies, it is not a distant or faraway 
problem. It drives government corrup-
tion; it drives organized crime; it 
drives drug abuse and drug trafficking. 
And then it expands migration that 
could start as a country’s problems but 
very quickly become our country’s 
problems as well. When we don’t step 
up, we see that other nations—China 
and Russia, in particular—in the Amer-
icas fill the vacuum. 
As Latin America and the Caribbean 
countries continue to face challenges 
from the COVID–19 pandemic—where 
the region has had the highest global 
per capita infection and death rates in 
the world and is experiencing the larg-
est economic contraction of any region 
in the world—the IDB has a key role to 
play in improving economic outcomes 
for the region. 
But the problem is the IDB is with-
out an executive director. It is without 
leadership confirmed by the Senate at 
this critical moment in time. 
Leopoldo Martinez brings decades of 
experience in the public and private 
sectors, as well as academia. He has ex-
tensive experience advising Fortune 500 
companies, private equity funds, inter-
national businesses, and nongovern-
mental organizations. He is the CEO 
for the Center for Democracy and De-
velopment of the Americas, as well as a 
commissioner for small business in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia. He is on 
the board of one of our public univer-
sities, the University of Mary Wash-
ington. 
And as I have said, he is not just a 
constituent; he is also a friend. And in 
all respect, he is outstandingly quali-
fied for this position. 
Now, I understand that there are dif-
ferences of opinion in the Senate about 
the success, or lack thereof, about the 
Biden 
administration’s 
policies 
in 
Latin America. Earlier this week or 
late last week, some of my Republicans 
challenged the Biden administration as 
being too soft on corruption issues in 
the Americas. 
I was asked about my Republican col-
leagues’ critiques, and I would say: 
Well, I got a critique, too. I wouldn’t 
say they are too soft, but I would say 
they are too inattentive. I don’t think 
we have, under this administration or 
the previous administration or the pre-
vious administration—going back near-
ly to the beginning of this country, I 
don’t think we paid the attention to 
the Americas that we should. 
And when we only pay episodic atten-
tion to the Americas, a lot of bad 
things happen in Western Hemisphere 
countries that end up making things 
worse for us. But if there is a critique 
to be laid against the Biden adminis-
tration, or any administration in the 
Americas, we don’t solve the critique 
by leaving key positions vacant that 
could be used to strengthen our activi-
ties in the hemisphere. 
I understand that some of my col-
leagues have objected—and this was 
raised in the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee—to some, frankly, partisan 
tweets—some 
annoying 
and 
nasty 
tweets—that my friend Leo Martinez 
put on his social media accounts. 
I want to say to pages: You might 
want to think about this now because 
in 10 or 30 years when you are running 
for the Senate or you are up for a posi-
tion that is a Senate-confirmed posi-
tion, anything you tweet is going to be 
held against you. 
But I do think they have to be put 
into context. My friend Mr. Martinez is 
a Democrat. And no surprise, he is 
being nominated by a Democratic ad-
ministration. He has let his tongue 
race ahead of his brain on a couple of 
occasions. But I think all 100 of us have 
seen this pretty often in the last 10 
years, and we have learned to apply a 
little bit of a discounting to it. 
I have voted for many Trump admin-
istration nominees who had some nega-
tive tweets and even said negative 
things about me. I didn’t like them and 
I wouldn’t have nominated them, but I 
would acknowledge that they are quali-
fied for the job. And I believe that Mr. 
Martinez is more than that. 
Finally, I want to speak, in par-
ticular, to my colleague from Texas, 
who is here. My colleague from Texas 
serves with me on the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. I believe I am going 
to be accurate about this, but I will be 
corrected if I get any details wrong. He 
asked Mr. Martinez in some written 
questions about working together with 
faith-based organizations in his role in 
the IDB should he be confirmed be-
cause 
throughout 
the 
region 
and 
throughout the world, sometimes faith- 
based organizations are some of the 
most effective in, for example, pro-
viding humanitarian aid, working with 
refugees, et cetera. 
The initial responses from Mr. Mar-
tinez, I believe, were not satisfactory 
to my colleague, and maybe other col-
leagues as well, but I do believe that 
Mr. Martinez has tried to amplify those 
and meet and discuss this issue. 
I worked as a missionary in Hon-
duras. I know very powerfully the role 
that religious organizations do in the 
region. I know how important it is for 
us, whether it is USAID or State De-
partment or IDP, to work in tandem 
with some of these faith-based organi-
zations who do such a powerful job. 
And everything I know about my friend 
Mr. Martinez suggests that he would 
see the value of those partnerships as 
well. 
So with that, Madam President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing rule XXII, the Committee on 
Senate Foreign Relations be discharged 
and the Senate proceed to the fol-
lowing nomination: PN1028, Leopoldo 
Martinez Nucete, to be Executive Di-
rector of the Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank; that the Senate vote on 
the nomination, with no intervening 
action or debate; that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table; and that no further mo-
tions be in order as to this nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
Let me start by expressing agree-
ment with my friend from Virginia on 
two points he just raised: No. 1, his 
very good advice to the pages here and 
to any Senate staff that might be lis-
tening. The best thing to do probably is 
do not tweet. But if you must tweet— 
and I am guilty of that offense my-
self—remember that your tweets can 
and will be used against you; that the 
internet is forever. And as the father of 
daughters, I sometimes am terrified of 
what our children will say and to see it 
come back to haunt them years and 
decades later. 
And the second thing my friend from 
Virginia said that I also agree with is 
he said, administrations from both par-
ties have neglected the Americas. I 
think that is a serious problem. I am a 
strong believer in the Monroe Doctrine. 
I think the United States of America 
has a pivotal leadership responsibility 
in North America and in South Amer-
ica. And I think under both Republican 
and Democrat administrations, too 
often the executive branch has ne-
glected the vital role of Central Amer-
ica, of South America, of our friends 
throughout the Americas. I think that 
problem has been exacerbated under 
the 
Biden 
administration 
because 
under the Biden administration, not 
only have they neglected the hemi-
sphere, but what little attention they 
have given has had the effect of ele-
vating the extreme left in Latin Amer-
ica—elevating 
socialists, 
elevating 
Marxists, elevating terrorists, and ele-
vating enemies of America. 
We see this tragically in the recent 
election in Colombia, where a strong 
friend and ally of America is now led 
by someone who had been a hard-left 
active terrorist, and I believe the Biden 
administration’s 
actions, 
including 
delisting multiple terrorists from our 
official terrorism list, played a role in 
elevating an anti-American leftist in 
Colombia. 
Well, how does that relate to this 
nomination? I rise to express very sig-
nificant concerns with the nomination 
of Mr. Martinez Nucete. 
For one thing, at the outset, Mr. 
Martinez Nucete is a man of the left— 
a man of the hard left. Now, the Sen-
ator from Virginia suggested that he 
may have sent an ill-advised tweet now 
and then, and that is true, but that is 
not the basis of my opposition. 
He has been a hard partisan his en-
tire life, and even further than that— 
and this is really quite remarkable— 
Mr. Martinez Nucete was actually a So-
cialist 
congressman 
in 
Venezuela. 
Under Hugo Chavez, he was a member 
or his party was a member of Socialist 
International, and he was a man of the 
hard left, the anti-American hard left.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4843 
September 20, 2022 
Hugo Chavez was an unshakable enemy 
of America. Nicholas Maduro continues 
to be a brutal dictator, an illegitimate 
leader, and an enemy of America. 
I believe President Biden nominating 
a fellow traveler, a Socialist congress-
man from Venezuela, for a major role 
dealing with Latin America is aston-
ishingly ill-advised. 
Secondly, Mr. Martinez Nucete has 
expressed an unusual—an odd—hos-
tility to and antipathy for people of 
faith. This is not something we have 
seen in many nominees, but his an-
swers have been peculiar in this regard. 
It is particularly inappropriate for the 
job to which he has been nominated. 
For example, here is what the World 
Bank says about their role: 
The Bank recognizes— 
This is speaking of faith-based orga-
nizations. 
—their distinct strategic value given their 
unique attributes, including the fact that 
more than 80 percent of the world’s popu-
lation claims religious affiliations. [Faith- 
based organizations] are found in every coun-
try and offer opportunities for partnership 
and advocacy on a broad range of key devel-
opment issues. 
It is not just the World Bank. Here is 
what USAID said: 
Faith-based . . . organizations serve some 
of the most vulnerable populations in the 
world. They are often the first in and the 
last to leave, and [are] uniquely qualified to 
identify and meet local needs. 
Indeed, here is what a study actually 
funded by the Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank, where Martinez Nucete 
would 
be 
representing 
the 
United 
States, said, the IADB: 
All institutions surveyed partnered with 
community groups and faith-based organiza-
tions to provide information. 
Now, what are Mr. Martinez Nucete’s 
views? Well, I asked him about them 
specifically when he came in front of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. I asked him the extent to 
which he believed faith should be dis-
entangled from development, because 
he had previously been quite vocal on 
his passions in that regard. 
Here is his answer: 
There should be no entanglement between 
government and religion. That is a bedrock 
constitutional principle for us in America. I 
don’t think any particular culture or reli-
gion is superior to others in terms of achiev-
ing socioeconomic development. 
Now, that answer was odd, and it was 
nonresponsive to the question I asked, 
so I asked more precisely for Mr. Mar-
tinez Nucete to describe the role that 
faith plays in economic development as 
a constraint and a contributing factor. 
And I remind you that these organiza-
tions repeatedly said faith-based orga-
nizations are integral to success in 
their mission. 
Here is his answer: 
Education and respect for human rights, 
promoting social mobility in market econo-
mies, is the key to development, not faith. 
That is unusual. That degree of I 
think myopic hostility to faith and 
those with faith is odd in any nominee 
but particularly one who would be re-
quired to deal with faith-based organi-
zations on a daily basis. 
I raised these arguments in com-
mittee, and he was defeated in the 
committee. We had an even—a dead-
locked vote in the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee precisely because of 
his answers, and then after that, he 
came back and revised his answers. I 
would say his revised answers were ter-
rific. Clearly, someone wrote them who 
apparently does not have a manifest 
hostility to people of faith. But there is 
no reason to believe that his first an-
swers were not true and honest and a 
reflection of his views. 
There was a time not too long ago 
where the U.S. Senate found bipartisan 
consensus on many issues, including a 
defense of religious liberty. The Reli-
gious Freedom Restoration Act passed 
this body; I believe the vote was 97 to 
3. Numerous iconic, liberal Democrats 
voted for RFRA. President Bill Clinton 
signed the Religious Freedom Restora-
tion Act into law. Sadly, we are no 
longer in that era. Too many in the 
Democratic Party now have embraced 
a view that is hostile and antagonistic 
to people of faith, whether people of 
the Christian faith, people of the Jew-
ish faith, or people of other faiths. I 
wish that were not the case. 
Nevertheless, I believe it is inappro-
priate for the U.S. representative on a 
development board that is required to 
deal with faith-based organizations on 
a regular basis to be both an extreme 
man of the left who was a Socialist 
congressman under Hugo Chavez and 
an individual who has expressed re-
peated antipathy to people of faith. Ac-
cordingly, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, just a 
brief response. I will not respond to 
Senator CRUZ’s representation of Mr. 
Martinez’s testimony before the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. He has 
his opinion about what those words 
mean, and I think he quoted them ac-
curately. But I would just say for any-
one, you can go and look at that quote 
and decide for yourself whether you 
think that was a statement that was 
hostile to faith or whether that was a 
statement by a bank or business guy 
financier about what he thought were 
the most important issues that an 
international development bank should 
be focused on. 
I read those same comments as not 
hostile or antipathetic to faith; I view 
them as comments of an individual 
who has been in the finance industry 
who knows what the remit of the inter-
national development bank is and is 
talking about his own priorities in 
terms of how that bank should pro-
gram their work. 
But I do want to respond to the first 
point. Senator CRUZ is correct about 
Mr. Martinez’s past. He grew up in 
Venezuela. He was initially in a gov-
ernment that apparently had a lot of 
promise to offer to Venezuelans be-
cause Mr. Chavez was elected by Ven-
ezuelans in a democratic election over-
whelmingly. But my colleague didn’t 
tell you the rest of the story. 
Mr. Martinez is now a political exile 
from Venezuela who was part of the 
Venezuelan opposition, who has been 
strong in critiquing the human rights’ 
record of both the Chavez and Maduro 
regimes, and I think that is actually 
one of the reasons that President Biden 
nominated him for this position. If 
anyone knows the danger of authori-
tarian governments, including authori-
tarian governments from the left in the 
Americas, and knows what it will take 
for America to counter that with smart 
strategies, it is somebody who grew up 
in that culture and came to realize the 
dangerous path that his country was 
on. 
I think whoever is the IDB President 
is going to have an awful lot of work to 
do, but the single largest challenge in 
the Americas right now, at least in 
terms of pushing refugees out of the 
country, is in Venezuela. And who bet-
ter than someone who knows it first-
hand and, after seeing it, decided to be-
come a dedicated member of the Ven-
ezuelan opposition in exile in the 
United States—who better to counter 
that influence? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, for 
each of the past 61 years straight, the 
Senate has passed the National Defense 
Authorization Act. I still remember 
the Presiding Officer’s predecessor, 
John McCain, who used to rail on the 
Senate to get this done and making the 
very correct point that this should be 
the No. 1 priority of the U.S. Con-
gress—making sure that our men and 
women in uniform received the train-
ing, the support, and the weapons they 
need in order to keep America safe. 
The annual Defense bill is part of 
Congress’s commitment to give our 
men and women in uniform the re-
sources they need to surmount the 
growing threats of today and prepare 
for the ones that inevitably will come 
tomorrow. 
As we know here in the Senate, the 
global threat landscape is not getting 
easier. It is getting more and more 
dangerous. Some of the changes happen 
quickly and can be traced to a single 
moment in time. 
For example, September 11, 2001, 
changed everything in our conversa-
tion and our acts to fight terrorism 
across the world. That single day and 
that single act forced us to reexamine 
our longstanding military paradigm

September 20, 2022 
and change course as rapidly as we 
could. 
But other threats grow over time. 
Just look at the rise of the People’s 
Republic of China. Over the course of 
roughly four decades, China has trans-
formed itself from a poor, isolated 
country to the world’s second largest 
economy. Its wealth is used to finance 
a powerful military, with increasingly 
aggressive and hostile acts. 
Looking back over the last year or 
so, it is remarkable to consider how 
much has happened and how quickly 
the global threat picture has shifted. 
Last year at this time, American 
troops were still on the ground in Af-
ghanistan, but President Biden made 
the decision to retreat ahead of the 
20th anniversary of September 11, and 
our 
servicemembers 
and 
diplomats 
were preparing for what we assumed 
would be an orderly withdrawal. There 
wasn’t much optimism about the long- 
term fate of the Afghan Government, 
but it was expected to hold out for at 
least 6 months following our with-
drawal. 
At the same time, tensions between 
Russia and Ukraine were high, but 
nothing really much new. The coun-
tries have had a long, tense relation-
ship since the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, but there didn’t seem to be any 
reason for immediate alarm. Ukrainian 
cities were as vibrant, lively, and free 
as ever. 
In a little over a year’s time, though, 
all of that has changed. The Taliban 
took control of Afghanistan before our 
troops even exited, leading to a chaotic 
exit and the loss of 13 heroic service-
members and other Americans left be-
hind. 
In this period of time, Russia has 
launched 
an 
unprovoked 
war 
on 
Ukraine, bringing death and destruc-
tion to the Ukrainian people. Over the 
past several months, thousands of 
Ukrainian civilians have died and more 
than 13 million have been displaced. 
Europe is now experiencing the largest 
refugee crisis since World War II. 
To finance its ongoing war machine, 
Russia is developing even closer ties to 
communist China. Meanwhile, North 
Korea has declared itself a nuclear 
weapons state. Iran appears to be inch-
ing even closer to acquiring a nuclear 
weapon, and China’s threats against 
Taiwan have only grown more dan-
gerous in this period of time. 
It is striking to consider how much 
has changed in such a short period. 
Last summer, it would have been near-
ly impossible for us to predict that this 
is where we would be some 14 months 
later. 
I am reminded of former Secretary of 
Defense Bob Gates’ words in 2011. He 
said: 
When it comes to predicting the nature 
and location of our next military engage-
ments, since Vietnam, our record has been 
perfect. We haven’t gotten it right once. 
Of course, he is absolutely correct. It 
is impossible to anticipate the chal-
lenges that face us and that are on the 
horizon, but that doesn’t mean we 
should sit idly by and hope that we are 
ready for what is coming. There is sim-
ply no security in that sort of fantasy. 
We need to start taking actions today 
to ensure that we are prepared for 
whatever comes knocking at our door. 
Everybody knows that in order to se-
cure our defense and be prepared to 
deter aggression from aggressive actors 
we need money. We need to make sure 
that we have the weapons that are 
needed not only to supply countries 
like Ukraine, not only to replenish the 
supply from our NATO allies that have 
been, in turn, supplying weapons to 
Ukraine, but we need to be ready for 
whatever comes knocking at our door. 
Our military leaders need to plan and 
train every single day for the un-
known, and that is exactly why a 
strong, on-time National Defense Au-
thorization Act is absolutely critical. 
Now more than ever, we need to take 
stock of evolving threats and start pre-
paring. 
One of the problems that Britain 
faced in World War II is they did not 
heed 
Winston 
Churchill’s 
warning 
about the growing military strength 
and ambitions of Nazi Germany. Brit-
ain, in the end, as a result, was hanging 
on by a thread, and that is where the 
United States got involved in becoming 
the arsenal of democracy in the Lend- 
Lease Program, which provided the 
Brits the military equipment they 
needed, the aviation platforms, and the 
weapons in order to defend themselves 
and to survive until the United States 
got involved in World War II, following 
the attack at Pearl Harbor by the Jap-
anese. 
Over the last 20 years, we have devel-
oped a military that is used to fighting 
unconventional, asymmetrical threats, 
like insurgent groups in the Middle 
East. We have been focused on the war 
on terrorism since 9/11, but things have 
changed in the interim. Now, a conflict 
with China or Russia seems more like-
ly. 
To prevent or to prevail in such a 
conflict, we need a more conventional, 
highly technological modern military. 
In addition to determining what ca-
pabilities we need, we also have to ask 
ourselves whether our defense indus-
trial base—that arsenal of democracy, 
as Franklin Roosevelt called it in 
World War II—whether our defense in-
dustrial base can even support the pro-
duction of what our military will need 
to prepare for in the future. 
There is clearly a lot of work that 
needs to be done, but, like a lot of 
things, it can’t happen overnight. That 
is why it is so important that we get 
started today. In order for the military 
to invest in these new programs and 
capabilities to deter Chinese and Rus-
sian aggression against American in-
terests and American allies and in 
order to send the demand signal to our 
industrial base for new and emerging 
defense requirements, we have to pass 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. 
It is not just the long-term threats 
that we need to address. We need to 
close the near-term security gaps too. 
If another conflict came knocking at 
our door today, we would be at a tre-
mendous disadvantage; and that is, as I 
said, because the United States has 
been supplying weapons to Ukraine to 
defend its own sovereignty. But when 
we do that, that means those weapons 
are not available to us should Presi-
dent Xi decide to invade Taiwan or 
some other military conflict pops up 
around the world. 
We provided Ukraine with unprece-
dented defense aid, including Javelins, 
Stingers, 
grenade 
launchers, 
small 
arms, ammunition, and much more. 
This assistance, to be sure, is not a 
handout. This is not a charity project. 
Like our allies, the United States has 
made a strategic decision to invest in 
the outcome. It is not just that we 
want Ukraine to win this war; we also 
need Russia to lose. We cannot risk a 
Russian victory that will embolden the 
Kremlin to push its fight even farther 
West. 
There is no question that this is the 
right thing to do, both strategically 
and morally, but we must remain 
clear-eyed about the risks that our as-
sistance carries. Every piece of equip-
ment or weapon that we send is one 
less that we have ourselves in our arse-
nal. We need to ensure that the assist-
ance that we provide does not end up 
weakening our own military readiness. 
The cards are already stacked against 
us, and we certainly don’t need to 
weaken our own hand. 
That is why Senator SHAHEEN and I 
have introduced the Securing Amer-
ican ARMS Act, which will help us re-
plenish our defense stockpiles more 
quickly. The Pentagon is already work-
ing toward this goal, but there are a 
lot of bureaucratic hurdles and just 
redtape that stand in the way. 
The Defense Department can’t place 
an order for more Javelins and have 
them show up at the Pentagon 5 to 7 
business days later. It doesn’t work 
like that. The process of purchasing, 
manufacturing, and deploying lethal 
aid takes a lot of time which, frankly, 
we don’t have. 
That is where the Securing American 
ARMS Act comes in. This bill will re-
move some of those time-consuming 
hurdles to allow the Defense Depart-
ment to fast-track the procurement 
process. It will allow us to provide crit-
ical support for our partners and allies 
now and in the future without compro-
mising our own national defense. 
I appreciate Senator SHAHEEN work-
ing with me on this bill, which now has 
more than a dozen bipartisan cospon-
sors. I am offering this legislation as 
an amendment to the National Defense 
Authorization Act, and I hope my col-
leagues will join me in supporting its 
inclusion in the final bill. 
Now more than ever, a well-prepared 
and well-funded military is an impera-
tive. The rapid changes in the threat 
landscape should serve as a wake-up

call for anyone who thinks we can 
carry on with the status quo. 
For our forces to continue fighting 
and defeating evil in every corner of 
the world, we need to provide that 
funding. They need the stability, and 
they need the unwavering support of 
the U.S. Congress. 
As new powers rise and old powers 
fall, our country must be prepared for 
whatever changes are on the horizon. 
Congress has a critical role in that 
preparation, and we can’t ignore our

REMEMBERING QUEEN ELIZABETH II 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the life and 
service of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth 
II, who was laid to rest in Windsor Cas-

Queen Elizabeth conducted herself 
with dignity and grace and represented 
the best of the United Kingdom to the 
world. She was unwavering in her sup-
port for the United States, and the 
American 
people 
reciprocated 
with 
their admiration and respect for her. 
My sympathies to the royal family 
and to the people of Great Britain. We 
treasure our unique relationship and 
America stands with you once again as 
we mourn your loss. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, I am here on the floor 
of the Senate for the 23rd week in a 
row to bring to the attention of the 
Senate, to my constituents, and to the 
American people the latest news of 
Russia’s illegal, unprovoked, and bru-
tal war against Ukraine. 
I will talk about the disturbing news 
from Ukraine, about more Russian war 
crimes, and I will discuss the upcoming 
vote on the supplemental spending bill 
for the effort in Ukraine and why it is 
so important right now to continue to 
support Ukraine as it makes progress 
in pushing back against Russia’s war of 
aggression. 
Last week, I spoke about Ukraine’s 
stunning advances up here in the north 
around Kharkiv. After distracting the 
Russians with a counteroffensive here 
in the south near Kherson, the Ukrain-
ian Army launched a surprise counter-
offensive in the north and punched 
through the Russian lines. In just a 
matter of days—as you see in the light 
blue part of the map here, in just a 
matter of days, the Ukrainian Army 
was able to liberate roughly 300 settle-
ments across 3,000 square miles and lib-
erate over 150,000 Ukrainians from Rus-
sian occupation. They also managed to 
capture hundreds of pieces of Russian 
military equipment and vehicles and 
ammunition. So now, instead of being 
used to kill and subjugate innocent 
Ukrainian citizens, these vehicles, the 
equipment, and the munitions can be 
used by Ukrainian forces to liberate 
their fellow citizens from Russian tyr-
anny. There were stories of Russian 
soldiers abandoning their equipment 
and stealing Ukrainian cars to make 
their escape—even stealing motorbikes 
and bicycles. 
Last Wednesday, Ukraine’s President 
Zelenskyy visited a town in this area. 
The town is called Izium. Izium is lo-
cated right here on the map. It is a 
very strategic town for the Russians. 
Just 4 days before he stepped foot 
there, this town was under Russian oc-
cupation, and even when he visited, the 
frontline was only about 6 miles away. 
Izium had been used as an important 
logistics hub from which the Russians 
attacked south and east into the 
Donbas region—down into this area. 
This was supposed to be the northern 
part of the pincer that Russia would 
use to trap Ukrainian forces in the 
Donbas. The Ukrainian forces who were 
here had to deal with this area that 
would be used as a station ground to 
build a cut-off to Ukrainian troops. In-
stead, it is now under Ukrainian con-
trol. 
There were reportedly 10,000 Russian 
soldiers in this town of Izium, and 
most thought it would be months be-
fore Ukraine would recapture it. But 
after just a couple of days of a light-
ning strike, this town, which had been 
held by the Russians for 6 months, is 
now free, its Russian occupiers on the 
run. 
Unfortunately, what the occupiers 
left behind was not just military equip-
ment, but clear evidence of Russian 
atrocities. Ukrainian officials say mul-
tiple graves have been found near the 
city’s cemetery. President Zelenskyy 
has said it contained the bodies of ci-
vilians—civilian adults, civilian chil-
dren—as well as Ukrainian soldiers 
showing signs of violent deaths includ-
ing evidence of torture. 
Oleksandr Filchakov, the chief pros-
ecutor of the Kharkiv region, has con-
firmed that at least 445 graves were at 
one site in this town. Here is a photo of 
some of the corpses that had been dis-
covered. 
Some corpses had their hands tied be-
hind their backs. Others had ropes 
around their necks. Some victims are 
still being identified, but as an exam-
ple, investigators have confirmed that 
among 
the 
dead 
are 
the 
entire 
Stolpakov family—Elena, her husband 
Dmitry, 6-year-old Olesya, 8-year-old 
Sasha, and Elena’s parents. They were 
killed by a Russian air strike on their 
home in this region. Again, another 
target—a civilian target of Russian 
missiles. 
Nearly 400 civilian graves in Izium 
were found near a previous graveyard; 
but near there, they also found 17 
graves of Ukrainian soldiers. Their 
hands were all tied, and they appeared 
to be shot at close range. They were in 
a single mass grave, bodies piled upon 
one another. 
They were executed. So those killed 
in Izium were men, women, children, 
soldiers, and noncombatants alike— 
more victims of Russia’s brutal and 
unprovoked war. CNN described the 
scene this way: 
Even the heavy rainfall couldn’t erase the 
smell of death in pine forests in Izium. 
President Zelenskyy described it as 
‘‘cruelty and terrorism.’’ Ukrainian 
Ambassador to the United States, 
Oksana Markarova said yesterday that 
the scene was one of ‘‘torture, rapes, 
killings, and war crimes of a massive 
proportion.’’ It is indeed inhumane and 
genocide, but it is not the first time we 
have seen evidence of Russia commit-
ting such horrible atrocities. 
A commander in the National Guard 
announced that his team is also hunt-
ing for additional graves reportedly of 
people who were abused, victims who 
were abused, at a detention center in 
Kozacha Lopan, north of Kharkiv. It is 
this area up here. Certainly, we will 
learn about many more graves and 
many more atrocities in this area as 
we begin to discover more and more of 
these war crimes being committed by 
the Russians. 
Over 
the 
weekend, 
President 
Zelenskyy also said that Ukrainian 
forces had found 10 makeshift torture 
chambers throughout the liberated ter-
ritories in that Kharkiv region. Ac-
cording to him, some of these rooms 
had tools for Russian soldiers to con-
duct 
electric 
torture 
on 
innocent 
Ukrainians. This photo is from inside 
one of these cellars—one of these 
makeshift torture chambers—that were 
found in the Kharkiv region. Here you 
can see where a prisoner actually 
scratched the Lord’s Prayer on the 
wall of the torture chamber. 
The liberating soldiers are also re-
covering bodies on the battlefield, 
which is where they are aligned too 
often in farm fields or woods, just left 
to rot in the fields and the woods. This 
is what Russia has done to Ukraine. 
This is not a one-off event. 
When Senator KLOBUCHAR and I were 
in Ukraine 3 weeks ago, we visited 
Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, and we saw 
the spot where Russian soldiers had 
dug a mass grave for dozens of innocent 
civilians they had murdered during 
their occupation. Sadly, the murder, 
the torture, and the rape discovered in 
Bucha was not unique. These horrific 
events that happen behind Russian 
lines often aren’t known to the world 
until that area is liberated by Ukrain-
ian forces. One has to wonder what 
other Russian horrors are currently oc-
curring in occupied areas that we will 
witness when Ukraine finally liberates 
the rest of its territory. 
This is the grim reality of Russia’s 
war. President Putin claims that his

September 20, 2022 
war is about liberating Ukrainians and 
reuniting them with the Ukrainian 
‘‘brothers and sisters,’’ but this photo 
is not what brothers and sisters do to 
each other. This is not a war of free-
dom or a war of liberation. This is a 
war of conquest and genocide. And over 
the weekend, we also got a glimpse of 
what happens to the Ukrainian chil-
dren who have lost their parents in this 
war and fall into Russia’s hands. 
Russia’s Presidential Commissioner 
for Children’s Rights, who by the way 
has been sanctioned by the United 
States, recently stated that Russian 
authorities are placing 125 Ukrainian 
orphans with Russian families. Of 
course, the natural solution here would 
be to put these children in the care of 
their extended family members in 
Ukraine, allow them to stay in their 
country, but that is not their objec-
tive. Russia’s goal isn’t to provide a 
better future for these children. Their 
goal is to erase their Ukrainian iden-
tity and turn them into Russians. 
Under the rules laid down by the 
United Nations, ‘‘forcibly transferring 
children of one group to another 
group’’ constitutes genocide. Another 
example. 
Frustrated by Ukrainian gains in the 
northeast and in the south that we 
have seen on these maps, Russians 
have begun bombing civilian infra-
structure at increased rates, like pow-
erplants and dams, threatening the 
livelihoods of millions of innocent 
Ukrainians. Unfortunately, we have to 
expect more missiles being fired into 
Ukraine to terrorize civilians. 
Just this weekend, a Russian missile 
struck about 300 yards away from a nu-
clear powerplant in southern Ukraine, 
threatening a nuclear disaster. Now 
this was not the Zaporizhia plant that 
we have talked about a lot on this 
floor. This is another powerplant. The 
Zaporizhia plant, as you know, is the 
largest nuclear powerplant in all of Eu-
rope. It provides 20 percent of elec-
tricity—or 
did—to 
the 
country 
of 
Ukraine. That is a plant that the Rus-
sians are using as a shield, much as 
they have used energy as a weapon, in-
cluding in Europe, cutting off energy 
unless Europe agrees to stop the nec-
essary sanctions. They have used food 
as a weapon, bombing grain bins in the 
Odesa region, keeping food from going 
to starving people in Africa. Now they 
are actually using nuclear powerplants 
as weapons in this war. It is all reck-
less; it is all dangerous, but this risks 
a catastrophe by creating a military 
zone around a nuclear powerplant and 
firing on Ukrainian forces from there 
and actually exploding parts of the 
plant that connect to Ukraine. This is 
incredibly dangerous and risks some-
thing like the tragedy we had at 
Chernobyl. 
So all of this is precisely why we 
need to continue to give Ukraine the 
help it so desperately needs. Vladimir 
Putin will continue his reign of terror 
against the neighbor that just wants to 
live in peace, unless he knows that 
there are consequences. He is betting 
that he can use terror to intimidate 
Ukraine and its allies into surren-
dering. 
Let me be clear, I want this brutal 
war to end as much as anyone else in 
this Chamber, but the responsible way 
to end this war is not to stop providing 
our assistance to our allies and watch 
as Ukraine slowly falls to Russian 
domination. The right way to end this 
war is to actually win it, to continue 
to provide Ukraine the weapons it 
needs to keep advancing and liberating 
territory, like it did over these past 
few weeks. For the sake of global free-
dom, Ukraine must be allowed to end 
this war on its own terms, not Russia’s. 
That is why, when this Chamber 
votes on the continuing resolution to 
keep government open next week, I 
urge my colleagues to also support the 
expected supplemental request for ad-
ditional Ukraine funding. Most impor-
tant to me, frankly, is the military 
support, including needed ammunition 
for the weapons they already have and 
including refilling our own stockpiles 
of military weapons and ammunition. 
This is one way we can show Vladimir 
Putin that we will not stand for his 
war crimes. The West and our allies all 
need to recognize that these Russian 
atrocities will not stop until there are 
more victories on the battlefield and 
until sanctions are more effective at 
cutting off funding to Russia’s war ma-
chine. The world is watching, and if 
President Putin’s military is not held 
accountable for these atrocities, it 
sends a signal to other rogue leaders 
that they will be able to get away with 
the same types of war crimes. 
As Congress considers this latest re-
quest for support, I hope my colleagues 
will think about four things. 
One, the mass graves I mentioned at 
the beginning of my speech. We should 
not turn a blind eye to the indiscrimi-
nate violence Russia has wrought on 
Ukraine. Vladimir Putin will continue 
his reign of terror against the neighbor 
that just wants to live in peace unless 
he knows, again, that there will be con-
sequences. 
As 
President 
Zelenskyy 
said, ‘‘Russia leaves death everywhere 
and must pay for it.’’ 
Second, 
despite 
these 
atrocities, 
Ukraine is turning the tide of the war, 
in large measure, because of our help. 
It is working. This map, to me, is very 
interesting because it shows here on 
February 24, after the invasion of 
Ukraine on that date, how much terri-
tory that the Russians controlled, not 
just the parts that they had already 
controlled, down here in Crimea, here 
in Luhansk and Donetsk. But look at 
all the territory that they controlled 
at that time, including right up to the 
city of Kyiv. This is where the famous 
battle occurred at the airfield outside 
of Kyiv where they had planned to 
bring in heavy weapons and more mili-
tary and topple the government in the 
capital of Kyiv. But, look, all this in 
red, all of this in red; and today here 
we are. So we have made progress. The 
Russians have come along the Donbas 
area. And now, more recently, of 
course, 
we 
have 
made 
additional 
progress, here and here, to push the 
Russians back. This would not have 
happened without the support of this 
body. And we must think about that as 
we look at this additional request for 
funding. We are making a difference. 
Specifically, thanks to this Congress, 
these 
long-range 
missiles 
called 
HIMARS have been extremely effective 
in enabling Ukraine to be able to strike 
behind enemy lines and disrupt Russia 
in ways no one thought possible. Before 
the Russians were sitting back and fir-
ing on Ukrainian positions and Ukrain-
ians couldn’t respond because they 
couldn’t reach the Russian guns. They 
were firing with impunity, killing ci-
vilians, 
killing 
Ukrainian 
soldiers. 
Now, with these new weapons, these 
HIMARS, these longer range missiles 
coming from the United States, coming 
from the UK, coming from Germany, 
Ukrainians are able to hold their own 
and more, as we see with their ad-
vances in the south and in the north-
east. 
We need to keep it up, particularly at 
a time when Russia is getting help 
from its own partners. As our Repub-
lican 
leader, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, 
pointed out, Iran is equipping the Rus-
sian military with armed drones like 
the ones that they used against Amer-
ican forces in Syria and Iraq. Addition-
ally, there are reports that North 
Korea has supplied Russia with artil-
lery shells. 
Third, I would ask my colleagues to 
remember 
this 
is 
not 
just 
about 
Ukraine. We have got to remember 
that Vladimir Putin has said that ‘‘the 
borders of Russia never end.’’ 
Earlier this summer, President Putin 
said he views Ukraine as basically just 
the first step toward recreating the 
Russian empire. His advisers have 
made similar statements about their 
intent with regard to this war. It is not 
just about Ukraine. 
What the United States does matters. 
What we do in defense of global free-
dom not only shows the world we will 
stand up for Ukraine against a rogue 
authoritarian attacking an ally, but 
our actions show our adversaries that 
we are ready to defend democracy 
around the world. And it is not just the 
United States providing this military 
support, just remember that. Forty- 
nine other countries are contributing, 
in one way or another, weapons, am-
munition, training, and so on. And 
with regard to economic support, more 
countries than 50 are providing help to 
Ukraine. 
Fourth, I ask my colleagues to re-
member 
that 
there 
are 
important 
guardrails to ensure this assistance 
from the U.S. taxpayers is very well ac-
counted for, and there should be. While 
in Poland recently, Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and I met with the 101st Airborne to 
discuss their unprecedented end-use 
monitoring of our military equipment 
that goes into Ukraine. This has

ramped up even further with the addi-
tion of our Embassy staff on the 
ground in Kyiv, which we also heard 
about when we were there, to ensure 
there is no diversion of the military as-
sistance that we are providing. Again, 
this is an unprecedented level of ac-
countability, 
and 
it 
is 
necessary. 
Transparency is absolutely needed and 
promised by the Ukrainians. I will say 
that from President Zelenskyy to 
members of his government, to mem-
bers of Parliament we met with, every-
one said the same thing; they too want 
total transparency and accountability. 
It is very important to them. Just as 
they are continuing their reforms 
against corruption even in the face of 
this war, they want transparency with 
regard to all the aid. They have an ac-
counting firm in Ukraine that is fol-
lowing the budgetary funding that goes 
from this place, this Congress, to 
Ukraine as well. And they have a need 
and an interest in transparency them-
selves. 
With regard to the end game in 
Ukraine—and some have asked me 
about here on this floor—I believe 
Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United 
States, Oksana Markarova, said it well: 
Ukraine will not rest until all our country 
is free, all our people are back and Russia is 
brought to justice. 
As Russia’s military suffers setbacks 
in Ukraine, that is actually good news 
for the freedom-loving countries of the 
world. For decades, Russia has used its 
military to threaten and coerce its 
neighbors. Think of Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine this year and back in 2014 
when they invaded Crimea and the 
Donbas. Russia, under its current gov-
ernment, is a threat to all of its neigh-
bors. Think about its invasion in Geor-
gia in 2008, and its ongoing occupation 
of parts of Moldova, just to name a 
couple. 
As Russia’s military is weakened, 
Europe and the United States are made 
safer. So our support matters. Global 
support matters. I believe President 
Putin responds to strength, and weak-
ness on our part would only invite 
more aggression. Helping Ukraine is 
just one way to show our strength and 
to show our resolve as a country and as 
an alliance. I noted last week that we 
are finally seeing the fruits of our 
labor when you look at the progress 
that has been made. The support now is 
more important than ever. Three thou-
sand—three thousand square miles of 
territory has been liberated just in the 
past few weeks. 
This is the battle of our generation. 
This 
is 
the 
fight 
between 
authoritarianism and democracy on 
the world stage—the fight between evil 
and good. Freedom is at stake. Ukrain-
ians are fighting for that. They are 
fighting for democracy, for the right to 
live free, for the right to chart their 
own course; and, as we have seen, they 
will fight like hell for it. We see this 
every single day in their courage and 
their resolve. They are fighting for 
their family. They are fighting for 
their homeland. They are fighting for 
their freedom. 
When Senator KLOBUCHAR and I met 
with President Zelenskyy last month, 
he started and ended our discussion 
with expressing gratitude to the Amer-
ican people for their willingness to 
stand with Ukraine. He spoke about 
Russia’s war on his country as our 
joint battle as all freedom-loving coun-
tries strive toward our joint victory. 
Ukraine is the shield of democracy. It 
is bearing the full brunt of the aggres-
sion 
that 
Russia 
has 
threatened 
against Europe for years and is still 
standing strong. 
It is in our interest that Russia’s 
military aggression ends here. The 
sword of Russian imperialism must be 
broken in Ukraine by Ukrainians, and 
the United States and our allies need 
to continue to provide those brave 
Ukrainians with the tools they need to 
be successful.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that,

The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the en bloc nomina-
tions of Randy W. Berry, of Colorado, a 
Career Member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, Class of Career Minister, to be 
Ambassador Extraordinary and Pleni-
potentiary of the United States of 
America to the Republic of Namibia; 
and Robert A. Wood, of New York, to 
be Alternate Representative of the

Political Affairs in the United Nations, 
with the rank of Ambassador? 
The nominations were confirmed en

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish 
to submit to the Senate a budget 
scorekeeping report. The report, which 
covers fiscal year 2022, was prepared by 
my staff on the Budget Committee and 
the Congressional Budget Office pursu-
ant to section 308(b) and in aid of sec-
tion 311 of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974, as amended. This informa-
tion allows the Senate Budget Com-
mittee 
to 
determine 
if 
budgetary 
points of order lie against pending leg-
islation. 
The report shows the effect on spend-
ing and revenues of congressional ac-
tion through September 15, 2022, as 
compared to the levels the Senate 
agreed to in the budget resolution for 
fiscal year 2022, S. Con. Res. 14. Since 
my last scorekeeping report on April 
28, seven laws with significant budg-
etary effects have been signed by the 
President, and I have revised the levels 
in the budget resolution two times for 
legislation. 
The Democratic staff of the Budget 
Committee prepared tables 1 and 2. 
Table 1 compares the mandatory spend-
ing of each authorizing committee 
against 
the 
enforceable 
allocations 
under section 302 of the Congressional 
Budget Act. It shows 10 of the 16 au-
thorizing committees are in compli-
ance with their allocations, either be-
cause no legislation with significant 
budgetary costs was enacted or the leg-
islation qualified under the budget res-
olution for an allocation adjustment. 
Most of the spending above allowable 
levels is attributed to either the CHIPS 
Act of 2022 or the Honoring our PACT 
Act of 2022. 
Table 2 shows the Senate pay-as-you- 
go—PAYGO—scorecard 
tallying 
en-
acted legislation with significant ef-
fects on mandatory spending and reve-
nues. The scorecard shows a savings of 
$4.7 billion in 2022, a deficit of $174 bil-
lion over the 2022–2026 period, and a 
deficit of $528 billion over the 2022–2031 
period. When compared to the allow-
able amounts on the PAYGO scorecard 
last adjusted on September 12, there is 
a deficit of $1.3 billion on the scorecard 
for 2022, $185 billion over the 2022–2026 
period, and $667 billion over the 2022– 
2031 period. 
In addition to these tables, I am sub-
mitting a letter from the Congressional 
Budget Office with further detail. For 
fiscal year 2022, current budgetary lev-
els are within allowed amounts. Cur-
rent law budget authority is $2.6 billion 
below the maximum allowed in the re-
vised budget resolution, outlays are $17 
billion below the allowed maximum, 
and revenues are $68 million above the 
allowed minimum. The tables also 
show that there has been no net change 
for Social Security. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
letter and accompanying tables from 
CBO be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

a On September 23, 2021, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget reset the Senate’s Pay-As-You-Go Scorecard to zero for all fiscal years. 
b The amounts shown represent the estimated effect of the public laws on the deficit. 
c Excludes off-budget amounts. 
d Section 3201(b) requires the budgetary effects of that division to be excluded from the Senate’s PAYGO scorecard; however, the revenue effects from the immigration extensions included in division A are included in the scorecard be-
cause division A does not fall within the exclusion in section 3201 of division D. 
e Pursuant to section 3110 of S. Con. Res. 11 (114th Congress), the Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2016, the budgetary effects stemming from increases in enterprise guarantee fees of the Federal National Mortgage Asso-
ciation and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are excluded. 
f Pursuant to section 905(b), the budgetary effects of division J are excluded from the Senate’s PAYGO Scorecard. In addition, 905(c) classifies the budgetary effects of division J as emergency and emergency amounts are excluded from 
the Senate’s PAYGO Scorecard. 
g Section 2201 requires the estimated budgetary effects stemming from division C to be excluded from the Senate’s PAYGO Scorecard; however, the insignificant revenue effects from immigration extensions included in division A are in-
cluded in the scorecard because division A does not fall within the exclusion of section 2201. 
h The act increases outlays and revenues by an equal amount resulting in a neutral net impact on the deficit. 
i CBO has insufficient information about how the Administration would use the authorities under this legislation and thus has no basis to estimate its effects on federal spending. 
j Section 21(b) designates that the outlays that were previously designated as emergency would continue to be designated as emergency pursuant to section 4001(a) and section 4001(b) of S.Con.Res. 14 (117th Congress). The revenues 
however, are included in this table but are insignificant in every year and cumulatively. 
k Section 23005 excludes the budgetary effects of each division in this Act from the Senate’s PAYGO Scorecard. 
l The budgetary effects of the bill are excluded from the Senate PAYGO Scorecard pursuant to sections 102(f)(2), 106(e)(2), 107(e)(2), and 10003(b). 
m Pursuant to section 4106(a)(6) of H.Con.Res. 71, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018 (115th Congress), a reconciliation bill that provides net deficit reduction shall not be entered on the Senate’s PAYGO 
Scorecard. Since the current year and five-year totals do not provide deficit reduction they are included in this table. 
ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, sec-
tion 36(b) of the Arms Export Control 
Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF SPECIAL 
OLYMPICS WYOMING 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 50th anniversary 
of Special Olympics Wyoming, an orga-
nization that has made a profound dif-
ference in the lives of many Wyoming 
citizens. 
In October, Special Olympics Wyo-
ming will celebrate its 50th anniver-
sary held in conjunction with its an-
nual State Fall Tournament in Casper. 
Special Olympics was founded in 1962 
by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. It began in 
Maryland as a summer camp for youth 
with intellectual disabilities. Rose-
mary Kennedy, Eunice’s sister, had an 
intellectual disability and was the in-
spiration for Eunice. By 1968, Special 
Olympics had become a worldwide sen-
sation. Over 1,000 participants com-
peted in the first International Special 
Olympics Games in Chicago. 
Special Olympics Wyoming was es-
tablished 10 years later in 1972 by Helen 
and Lloyd Wampler. Their first event 
was the Wyoming Summer Games at 
Natrona County High School, where 215 
athletes competed in track and field or 
swimming. 
Special Olympics Wyoming offers 
year-round athletic and sports training 
for youth and adults who have an intel-
lectual disability. They provide ‘‘op-
portunities to develop physical fitness 
skills, express courage, experience joy 
and participate in the sharing of tal-
ents, skills and friendship with their 
families, friends, other Special Olym-
pics athletes and the community.’’ 
As the Wyoming athletes strive to 
meet their athletic goals, their partici-
pation and success within the program 
accentuates why Special Olympics Wy-
oming was started. Today, there are 
roughly 1,600 active athletes through-
out Wyoming who participate in 16 dif-
ferent sports. 
Special Olympics Wyoming hosts five 
annual statewide events that promote 
healthy competition, refine athletic 
skills, and build friendships statewide. 
These events include the State Winter 
Games, State Summer Games, Summer 
Sports Classic, Equestrian Show, and 
the State Fall Tournament. 
Former Special Olympics Wyoming 
CEO, Priscilla Dowse, is an exceptional 
example of this type of dedication. 
During her 44-year involvement in the 
program, Dowse more than tripled the 
number of athletes, expanded the uni-
fied partners from 70 to 525, and in-
creased fundraising efforts from $15,000 
to $186,000 with the partnership from 
Wyoming law enforcement. 
Her commitment to Special Olympics 
Wyoming led her to travel internation-
ally and incorporate different training 
and leadership programs in an effort to 
improve Special Olympics Wyoming. 
Dowse described Special Olympics Wy-
oming as ‘‘ . . . a place that individuals 
with intellectual disabilities had a 
place to shine, to be successful, to have 
fun and laugh. And I was mesmerized,’’ 
Since Dowse’s retirement, the orga-
nization has continued to grow under 
the leadership of Jen Haines. As Dowse 
said ‘‘if you put a team together, 
there’s almost nothing they can’t do.’’ 
Jen’s unwavering commitment will be 
a strong asset as the organization con-
tinues to thrive. 
The mission of Special Olympics Wy-
oming would not be possible without 
the resolute dedication of their staff 
members, coaches, volunteers and men-
tors contributing their time and exper-
tise to the athletes. Current Staff and 
Board Members are: 
Jennifer Haines—CEO & President 
Tara Short—Vice President of Devel-
opment

impact 
and 
opportunities

ple living with intellectual disabilities

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING PHIL HANCEFORD 
∑ Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to 
pay my respects to Phil Hanceford, a 
tireless and broadly respected advocate 
for public land conservation. Phil unex-
pectedly passed away on August 14, 
2022. 
Phil served more than 15 years as an 
attorney, policy expert, and conserva-
tion director at The Wilderness Soci-
ety—TWS—in Denver, CO. He began his 
career with an internship at TWS while 
a student at the University of Colorado 
School of Law. Across a distinguished, 
15-year career, Phil played a signifi-
cant role in protecting some of the 
most important public lands in the 
West, from Bears Ears and Grand 
Staircase-Escalante 
National 
Monu-
ments, to conservation areas in the Pa-
cific Northwest, the Mojave Desert, Ne-
vada, and Colorado. 
Phil was an expert in land manage-
ment planning, specializing in the 
management of national monuments 
and other Bureau of Land Manage-
ment—BLM—conservation 
lands. 
He 
inspired and mentored countless indi-
viduals at TWS and across the con-
servation community, contributing his 
deep expertise and humble spirit to all 
who sought his advice or support. Over 
the years, his guidance helped shape a 
new cohort of effective advocates for 
America’s public lands. 
Phil’s greatest accomplishments in-
clude helping to create the National 
Landscape Conservation System; the 
adoption of the Desert Renewable En-
ergy Conservation Plan that conserved 
wildlands and promoted renewable en-
ergy development across nearly 11 mil-
lion acres in southern California; the 
restoration of Bears Ears and Grand 
Staircase-Escalante 
National 
Monu-
ments that protects over 3 million 
acres of stunning desert wilderness in 
southern Utah; and the establishment 
of Browns Canyon National Monument 
in Colorado. 
Phil was a champion of the BLM and 
earned the lasting respect of Bureau 
staff across the country for his warmth 
and expertise. He often went out of his 
way to connect with employees across 
the organization and fiercely advo-
cated for getting staff into the field to 
see firsthand the places they worked to 
protect. 
Phil grounded his work in humor, 
kindness, determination, and grace. He 
genuinely believed in the promise of 
public lands as a legacy for everyone— 
an issue that could bring Americans to-
gether regardless of where you lived or 
which political beliefs you held. Phil’s

RECOGNIZING 
DIXWELL 
AVENUE 
CONGREGATIONAL 
UNITED 
CHURCH OF CHRIST 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize Dixwell Ave-
nue United Congregational Church of 
Christ as it celebrates 202 years of spir-
itual leadership in New Haven, CT. I 
am honored to join Dixwell Congrega-
tional Church’s congregation and sup-
porters in celebrating the church’s bi-
centennial, 2 years later than planned 
due to the COVID–19 pandemic—just 
the latest obstacle the church has over-
come in its long and remarkable his-
tory. 
Dixwell Avenue United Congrega-
tional Church of Christ is the oldest 
African-American Congregational UCC 
church in the world. It was founded in 
1820, when Black residents in New 
Haven were unwelcome at the city’s 
traditional churches. Seeking the free-
dom to worship, a group of 22 Black 
New Haven residents persuaded a Yale 
student and abolitionist named Simeon 
Jocelyn to conduct religious services 
with them at his home. Together they 
formed the city’s first Black congrega-
tion and, after meeting house to house 
for 4 years, began renting a small 
church on Temple Street in New Haven 
in 1825. 
In 1837, the Rev. Dr. James W. C. Pen-
nington became the first Black pastor 
of Dixwell Avenue United Congrega-
tional Church of Christ. After fleeing 
from slavery, the Yale-educated Pen-
nington became internationally re-
nowned as a skilled orator. Under his 
leadership and the pastorate of his suc-
cessor, the Rev. Amos G. Beman, the 
church became one of America’s most 
eminent civil rights organizations and 
a cradle of the abolitionist movement. 
Not only did the church serve as a stop 
on the Underground Railroad, but 
many of its members were active on 
the Amistad Committee, which sup-
ported the defense in the landmark 1841 
case United States v, The Amistad, 
which resulted in the U.S. Supreme 
Court granting the enslaved people on-
board the ship their freedom. 
The church moved to its current 
home on Dixwell Avenue in 1886 and 
continued to work for the social better-
ment of the community. In the early 
20th century, the church donated the 
land on which the original Dixwell 
Community House was built, ensuring 
that generations of area residents had 
access to enriching education and 
recreation, as well as vital social serv-
ices. One of the central figures in the 
church’s recent history is the civil 
rights activist Rev. Dr. Edmond R. 
Edmunds, who led the church for near-
ly 40 years beginning in 1959. Under his 
pastorate, the congregation established 
daycare and afterschool programs that 
encouraged academic achievement in 
the Dixwell neighborhood. He also 
helped initiate the Dixwell Housing De-
velopment 
Corporation 
which, 
for 
many years, provided affordable hous-
ing to local, low-income families. 
The church’s current pastor, the Rev. 
Dr. Frederick ‘‘Jerry’’ Streets has car-
ried forth the congregation’s tradition 
of serving its community. Reverend 
Streets has fostered civil and construc-
tive conversations about race in New 
Haven, developed faith-based rehabili-
tation programs for individuals with 
substance abuse disorders, and initi-
ated summer STEM education pro-
grams for Dixwell neighborhood youth, 
amongst other good deeds. 
I have had the privilege of visiting 
Dixwell Avenue United Congregational 
Church of Christ on a number of occa-
sions and have always been welcomed 
as one of the congregation. This kind-
ness, free from judgement, has helped 
countless people in need over the past 
two centuries. 
As Dixwell Avenue United Congrega-
tional Church of Christ celebrates its 
bicentennial plus two this September, I 
applaud them on their extraordinary 
contributions—not just to the city of 
New Haven and State of Connecticut, 
but to our great Nation. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in congratulating 
Dixwell Avenue United Congregational 
Church of Christ on 202 years of com-
mitted worship and service to their 
community.∑

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
775—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
VIOLENCE 
AND 
THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST 
THE EMPLOYEES OF THE FED-
ERAL 
BUREAU 
OF 
INVESTIGA-
TION ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND 
SHOULD BE CONDEMNED 
Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. COONS, 
and Mr. BLUMENTHAL) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 775 
Whereas, pursuant to a judicially issued 
warrant, the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘FBI’’) 
searched the residence of former President 
Donald Trump (referred to in this preamble 
as ‘‘the former President’’) on August 8, 2022, 
for classified and national defense informa-
tion records owned by the United States (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘the search’’); 
Whereas, in the days following the search, 
employees of the FBI and their families have 
been subjected to threats of violence; 
Whereas the threats to employees of the 
FBI and their families have been inflamed 
by— 
(1) calls from members of Congress to 
‘‘destroy the FBI’’ or ‘‘defund the FBI’’; 
(2) members of Congress comparing the 
execution of a lawful warrant by the FBI to 
the actions of the Nazi Gestapo; and 
(3) repeated attacks from the former 
President, who has called FBI officials, 
among other insults, ‘‘vicious monsters’’; 
Whereas the FBI and the Department of 
Homeland Security issued an intelligence 
bulletin warning of a further increase in vio-
lent threats and acts of violence against Fed-
eral law enforcement officials and facilities 
following the search; 
Whereas these threats include placing a 
‘‘dirty bomb’’ outside of FBI headquarters 
and calls for ‘‘civil war’’ and ‘‘armed rebel-
lion’’; 
Whereas the FBI and the Department of 
Homeland Security have also ‘‘observed the 
personal identifying information of possible 
targets of violence, such as home addresses 
and identification of family members, dis-
seminated online as additional targets’’; 
Whereas a man wearing body armor and 
armed with an AR-15 rifle and nail gun at-
tempted to breach the FBI Cincinnati Field 
Office on August 11, 2022; 
Whereas a man was indicted on August 16, 
2022, for threatening to murder everyone at 
the FBI, from the Director, to agents, to the 
custodial staff; 
Whereas a man jumped a fence and threw 
rocks at the FBI Chicago Field Office on Au-
gust 25, 2022; 
Whereas the continued leveling of threats 
and baseless attacks against the FBI will in-
crease the risk of injury or death that em-
ployees of the FBI face; and 
Whereas the employees of the FBI put 
their lives on the line every day to protect 
the communities of the United States and 
uphold the rule of law: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns attacks and threats of vio-
lence against the employees of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation; 
(2) condemns calls from members of Con-
gress to ‘‘destroy the FBI’’ and ‘‘defund the 
FBI’’; 
(3) urges public officials at every level of 
government to reject and condemn political 
violence and the threat of political violence, 
regardless of its motivation;

employees of the Federal Bureau of Inves-

SENATE RESOLUTION 776—DESIG-
NATING 
SEPTEMBER 
2022 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER 
AWARENESS MONTH.’’ 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
CRAPO, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. KING, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, Mr. PADILLA, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. COONS, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. RISCH, Mr. WYDEN, and Mrs. CAP-
ITO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 776 
Whereas more than 3,100,000 men in the 
United States are living with prostate can-
cer; 
Whereas 1 in 8 men in the United States 
will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 
their lifetimes and 1 in 41 men in the United 
States will die from prostate cancer; 
Whereas prostate cancer is the most com-
monly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the 
second-leading 
cause 
of 
cancer-related 
deaths among men in the United States; 
Whereas the American Cancer Society esti-
mates that, in 2022, 268,490 men will be diag-
nosed with, and more than 34,500 men will 
die of, prostate cancer; 
Whereas 40 percent of newly diagnosed 
prostate cancer cases occur in men under the 
age of 65; 
Whereas the odds of developing prostate 
cancer rise rapidly after age 50; 
Whereas 
African-American 
men 
suffer 
from a prostate cancer incidence rate that is 
significantly higher than that of White men 
and have more than double the prostate can-
cer mortality rate of White men; 
Whereas having a father or brother with 
prostate cancer more than doubles the risk 
of a man developing prostate cancer, with a 
higher risk for men who have a brother with 
the disease and the highest risk for men with 
several affected relatives; 
Whereas screening by a digital rectal ex-
amination and a prostate-specific antigen 
blood test can detect the disease at the ear-
lier, more treatable stages, which could in-
crease the chances of survival for more than 
5 years to nearly 100 percent; 
Whereas only 30 percent of men survive 
more than 5 years if diagnosed with prostate 
cancer after the cancer has metastasized; 
Whereas there are typically no noticeable 
symptoms of prostate cancer in the early 
stages, making appropriate screening crit-
ical; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2022, the Director of 
the National Institutes of Health will sup-
port approximately $280,000,000 in research 
projects focused specifically on prostate can-
cer; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2022, Congress ap-
propriated $110,000,000 for the Prostate Can-
cer Research Program of the Department of 
Defense; 
Whereas the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs has established 20 Precision Oncology

TIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF 
STUDENT PARENTS AND RECOG-
NIZING SEPTEMBER 2022 AS NA-
TIONAL 
STUDENT 
PARENT 
MONTH 
Ms. DUCKWORTH (for herself and 
Mr. MORAN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 777 
Whereas student parents are individuals 
who have children and who attend postsec-
ondary educational institutions; 
Whereas student parents make up roughly 
1⁄4 of the postsecondary student population, 
totaling nearly 4,000,000 individuals; 
Whereas 70 percent of student parents are 
women, and 43 percent of student parents are 
single mothers, with nearly 1⁄2 of such stu-
dent parents being first-generation college 
students; 
Whereas 54 percent of single mothers who 
are enrolled at an institution of higher edu-
cation work 20 hours or more per week and 43 
percent work 30 hours or more per week, 
which requires those individuals to balance 
school, work, and caring for their depend-
ents; 
Whereas 51 percent of student parents are 
students of color, particularly female stu-
dents of color, with mothers representing— 
(1) 40 percent of Black postsecondary stu-
dents; 
(2) 36 percent of American Indian and Alas-
ka Native postsecondary students; 
(3) 35 percent of Native Hawaiian and Pa-
cific Islander postsecondary students; and 
(4) 26 percent of Hispanic postsecondary 
students; 
Whereas 47 percent of student parents are 
military-connected students; 
Whereas 
approximately 
2,500 
surviving 
military spouses, a majority of whom are 
parenting at least 1 child, are using edu-
cation benefits from the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs for surviving dependents; 
Whereas 84 percent of military spouses 
have some college education or credential 
and, on average, make 25 percent less than 
their civilian counterparts; 
Whereas nearly 2⁄3 of student parents have 
incomes at, below, or near the Federal pov-
erty line; 
Whereas 42 percent of student parents at-
tend community colleges and 30 percent at-
tend public or private nonprofit 4-year insti-
tutions of higher education; 
Whereas 1 in 3 college students enrolled in 
a health care program is a student parent; 
Whereas 53 percent of student parents re-
ported food insecurity and 68 percent re-
ported housing insecurity; 
Whereas, on average, student parents have 
higher grade point averages than their non- 
parenting peers, but student parents are 10 
times less likely to complete a bachelor’s de-
gree within 5 years than students without 
children; 
Whereas a low-income student parent who 
earns a degree or credential boosts the in-
come of that individual, and the earning po-
tential of the children of that individual 
when those children become adults, by 17 
percent; and 
Whereas student parents are uniquely mo-
tivated to excel in their courses of study 
while often facing challenges, including lack 
of affordable child care and balancing work 
responsibilities 
while 
attending 
postsec-
ondary educational institutions: Now, there-
fore be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses support for the contributions 
and achievements of student parents in seek-
ing and completing a postsecondary edu-
cation; and 
(2) designates September 2022 as ‘‘National 
Student Parent Month’’.

mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 778 
Whereas the theme for National Recovery 
Month in 2022 is ‘‘Every Person. Every Fam-
ily. Every Community.’’; 
Whereas more than 107,000 individuals in 
the United States suffered a fatal alcohol or 
drug overdose during 2021, an increase of al-
most 15 percent as compared to 2020; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
increased isolation and reduced access to 
treatment programs contributed to an in-
crease in individuals reporting anxiety and 
depression disorders as compared to 2019, 
with 13 percent of individuals in the United 
States reporting starting or increasing sub-
stance use during 2020; 
Whereas, in 2020, there were approximately 
21,000,000 individuals in the United States 
aged 18 or older in recovery from alcohol or 
drug addiction; 
Whereas, in 2018, it was estimated that the 
total cost to the economy of the United 
States of prescription opioid misuse, includ-
ing the costs of healthcare, lost produc-
tivity, and involvement of the criminal jus-
tice system, is $78,500,000,000 annually, and 
that figure has grown as a result of the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas trauma is a risk factor for sub-
stance use disorder, and there is a strong 
link between adverse childhood experiences 
or traumatic events and experiencing sub-
stance use disorder later in life; 
Whereas individuals with substance use 
disorder may face stigma from health profes-
sionals, as well as from friends and family;

cation for the prevention of substance use 
disorder; 
(2) acknowledges that factors such as in-
creased social isolation, mental distress, and

Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and Mr. WARNER) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 779 
Whereas estuary regions cover only 13 per-
cent of the land area in the continental 
United States, but contain nearly 40 percent 
of the population, 39 percent of the jobs, and 
47 percent of the economic output of the 
United States; 
Whereas the oceans, estuaries, and Great 
Lakes of the United States continue to fuel 
economic growth across the United States, 
which is evidenced by the fact that, by 2019— 
(1) employment levels in economic sectors 
relating to oceans and estuaries had in-
creased by 25 percent from employment lev-
els in those sectors in 2007, before the Great 
Recession; and 
(2) the average employment level of the en-
tire economy of the United States had in-
creased by 9 percent from that employment 
level in 2007, before the Great Recession; 
Whereas, between 2018 and 2019, economic 
sectors relating to estuaries, oceans, and 
Great Lakes in the United States— 
(1) created 88,000 new jobs; 
(2) employed 3,500,000 individuals; and 
(3) contributed $351,000,000,000 to the gross 
domestic product; 
Whereas the commercial and recreational 
fishing industries support more than 1,800,000 
jobs in the United States; 
Whereas, in 2019— 
(1) commercial and recreational saltwater 
fishing in the United States generated more 
than $255,000,000,000 in sales and contributed 
$117,000,000,000 to the gross domestic product 
of the United States; 
(2) angler trip expenditures totaled nearly 
$10,025,000,000; and 
(3) saltwater recreational fishing supported

across the United States, and contributed 
$50,122,000,000 to the gross domestic product 
of the United States; 
Whereas estuaries provide vital habitats 
for— 
(1) countless species of fish and wildlife, in-
cluding more than 68 percent of the commer-
cial fish catch in the United States by value 
and 80 percent of the recreational fish catch 
in the United States by weight; and 
(2) many species that are listed as threat-
ened or endangered species; 
Whereas estuaries provide critical eco-
system services that protect human health 
and public safety, including water filtration, 
flood control, shoreline stabilization, erosion 
prevention, and the protection of coastal 
communities during hurricanes, storms, and 
other extreme weather events; 
Whereas, by the 1980s, the United States 
had already lost more than 50 percent of the 
wetlands that existed in the original 13 colo-
nies; 
Whereas some bays in the United States 
that were once filled with fish and oysters 
have become dead zones filled with excess 
nutrients, chemical waste, and marine de-
bris; 
Whereas harmful algal blooms are hurting 
fish, wildlife, and human health, and are 
causing serious ecological and economic 
harm to some estuaries; 
Whereas changes in sea levels can affect 
estuarine water quality and estuarine habi-
tats; 
Whereas section 320 of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1330) (com-
monly known as the ‘‘Clean Water Act’’) au-
thorizes the development of comprehensive 
conservation and management plans to en-
sure that the designated uses of estuaries are 
protected and to restore and maintain— 
(1) the chemical, physical, and biological 
integrity of estuaries; 
(2) water quality; 
(3) a balanced indigenous population of 
shellfish, fish, and wildlife; and 
(4) recreational activities in estuaries; 
Whereas the Coastal Zone Management 
Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) provides 
that the policy of the United States is to 
preserve, protect, develop, and, if possible, 
restore or enhance the resources of the 
coastal zone of the United States, including 
estuaries, for current and future generations; 
Whereas 29 coastal and Great Lakes States 
and territories of the United States operate 
or contain a National Estuary Program or a 
National Estuarine Research Reserve; 
Whereas scientific study leads to a better 
understanding of the benefits of estuaries to 
human and ecological communities; 
Whereas the Federal Government, State, 
local, and Tribal governments, national and 
community organizations, and individuals 
work together to effectively manage the es-
tuaries of the United States; 
Whereas estuary restoration efforts restore 
natural infrastructure in local communities 
in a cost-effective manner, helping to create 
jobs and reestablish the natural functions of 
estuaries that yield countless benefits; and 
Whereas the week of September 17 through 
September 24, 2022, is recognized as ‘‘Na-
tional Estuaries Week’’ to increase aware-
ness among all people of the United States, 
including Federal Government and State, 
local, and Tribal government officials, about 
the importance of healthy estuaries and the 
need to protect and restore estuaries: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

through September 24, 2022, as ‘‘National Es-
tuaries Week’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Estuaries Week;

which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 780 
Whereas investment in the education, 
training, and career advancement of the 
workforce in the United States, known as 
‘‘workforce development’’, is crucial to the 
ability of the United States to compete in 
the global economy; 
Whereas collaboration among Governors, 
local governments, State and local edu-
cation, workforce, and human services agen-
cies, community colleges, local businesses,

based organizations, and workforce develop-
ment boards provides for long-term, sustain-

may be at risk due to new developments in 
technology and automation, while 50 percent 
said they would retrain for a career in a dif-
ferent field or industry if they had the oppor-
tunity; 
Whereas, in 2014, Congress reauthorized the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
(29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) with overwhelming bi-
partisan support in recognition of the need 
to strengthen the focus of the United States 
on the skills necessary to effectively prepare 
individuals for employment in local and re-
gional industries; 
Whereas the Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) supports 
employment, training, and support services 
for individuals with barriers to employment, 
including— 
(1) individuals who earn low incomes; 
(2) individuals who are out of work, includ-
ing the long-term unemployed; 
(3) individuals displaced by outsourcing; 
(4) individuals living in rural areas or areas 
with persistently high unemployment; 
(5) individuals looking to learn new skills; 
and 
(6) individuals with disabilities; 
Whereas the more than 550 workforce de-
velopment boards and 2,400 American Job 
Centers are a driving force behind growing 
regional economies by providing training, re-
sources, and assistance to workers who aim 
to compete in the 21st century economy; 
Whereas ongoing State and local imple-
mentation of the Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) pro-
vides unprecedented opportunities to develop 
the skills of workers in the United States 
through access to effective, quality work-
force education and training, including the 
development and delivery of proven strate-
gies such as sector partnerships, career path-
ways, integrated education and training, 
work-based learning models, and paid intern-
ships; 
Whereas, in 2022, programs authorized 
under the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) are pro-
jected to serve more than 5,000,000 young 
people and adults; 
Whereas State programs established under 
the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et 
seq.)— 
(1) ensured that approximately 2,500,000 
workers, including more than 146,000 vet-
erans and more than 120,000 individuals with 
disabilities, had access to career services vir-
tually and through American Job Centers 
during the 2020 program year; and 
(2) are a foundational part of the workforce 
development system; 
Whereas community colleges and other 
workforce development training providers 
across the United States are well situated— 
(1) to train the next generation of workers 
in the United States; and 
(2) to address the educational challenges 
created by emerging industries and techno-
logical advancements; 
Whereas participation in a career and tech-
nical education (referred to in this preamble 
as ‘‘CTE’’) program decreases the risk of stu-
dents dropping out of high school, and all 50 
States and the District of Columbia report 
higher graduation rates for CTE students 
compared to other students; 
Whereas community and technical colleges 
operate as open-access institutions serving 
millions of students annually at a compara-
tively low cost; 
Whereas the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Century 
Act (Public Law 115–224; 132 Stat. 1563) sup-
ports the development and implementation 
of high-quality CTE programs that— 
(1) combine rigorous academic content 
with occupational skills; and 
(2) serve approximately 12,300,000 high 
school and college students across the 
United States; 
Whereas there are approximately 600,000 
registered apprentices in the United States, 
and there is growing and bipartisan support 
for expanding quality earn-and-learn strate-
gies to help current and future workers gain 
skills and work experience; 
Whereas the federally supported workforce 
system and partner programs— 
(1) have helped rebuild the economy of the 
United States and provide increased eco-
nomic opportunities; and 
(2) provide a pathway into 21st century 
jobs that support families while ensuring 
that businesses in the United States find the 
skilled workforce needed to compete in the 
global economy; and 
Whereas workforce development is crucial 
to sustaining economic security for workers 
in the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2022 as ‘‘National 
Workforce Development Month’’; 
(2) supports Federal initiatives to promote 
workforce development; and 
(3) acknowledges that workforce develop-
ment plays a crucial role in supporting 
workers and growing the economy. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to support my bipartisan 
resolution—which I introduce along 
with Senators TODD
YOUNG, TAMMY 
BALDWIN, and TIM SCOTT—to designate 
September 2022 as National Workforce 
Development Month and to highlight 
the importance of workforce develop-
ment programs for dislocated workers, 
low-income adults, and at-risk youth. 
According to a recent poll, nearly 
half of U.S. workers said their current 
job may be at risk due to advance-
ments in technology and automation. 
By 2030, the number of U.S.-based jobs 
that will require more than a high 
school degree but not those of a 4-year 
college education is expected to in-
crease by nearly one-quarter. Our econ-
omy is changing, and our workforce 
must change along with it. 
Accordingly, both business leaders 
and workers say that they would ben-
efit from investments in worker skills 
training and development. 
In response to the needs of workers 
and businesses, Congress reauthorized 
the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act in 2014, which passed with 
strong bipartisan support. This land-
mark legislation has supported em-
ployment, training, and support serv-
ices in recognition of the need to 
strengthen the focus of the United 
States on the skills necessary to effec-
tively prepare individuals for employ-
ment in local and regional industries. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has led 
many Americans to adapt their work 
habits and change their jobs or career 
paths. The pandemic has also altered 
the demands for many jobs. It is there-
fore imperative for us to prioritize 
workforce development programs fo-
cused on this new reality while also 
getting people back to work. 
This resolution reaffirms the impact 
that education, skills training, and ca-
reer advancement training can have on 
workers’ ability to improve their lives. 
Our resolution would designate Sep-
tember 2022 as National Workforce De-
velopment Month, something Congress 
has done each year since 2017. More 
specifically, our resolution would reaf-
firm the Senate’s support for Federal 
initiatives promoting workforce devel-
opment and acknowledge the vital role 
this training plays in supporting em-
ployees, businesses, and our national 
economic prosperity. 
As the needs of businesses and work-
ers change, it is important that Con-
gress support the development of a 
skilled workforce. I hope my colleagues 
will join me in support of this resolu-
tion.

olution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 781 
Whereas polycystic ovary syndrome (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘PCOS’’) is a 
common health problem among women and 
girls involving a hormonal imbalance; 
Whereas there is no universal definition of 
PCOS, but researchers estimate that be-
tween 8 and 12 percent of women in the 
United States are affected by the condition; 
Whereas, according to a 2021 study, the an-
nual burden of PCOS in the United States is 
estimated to be $8,000,000,000, and this esti-
mate does not include— 
(1) the economic burden of mental health 
disorders associated with PCOS; 
(2) indirect and intangible costs related to 
the disorder; or 
(3) the cost of comorbidities in post-meno-
pause or adolescence; 
Whereas PCOS can affect girls at the onset 
of puberty and throughout the remainder of 
their lives; 
Whereas the symptoms of PCOS include in-
fertility, irregular or absent menstrual peri-
ods, acne, weight gain, thinning of scalp 
hair, excessive facial and body hair growth, 
numerous small ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, 
and mental health problems; 
Whereas women with PCOS have higher 
rates of mental health disorders, including 
depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and 
eating disorders, and are at greater risk for 
suicide; 
Whereas adolescents with PCOS often are 
not diagnosed, and many have metabolic 
dysfunction and insulin resistance, which 
can lead to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
non-
alcoholic 
fatty 
liver 
disease, 
and 
endometrial cancer at a young adult age; 
Whereas PCOS is a common cause of fe-
male infertility; 
Whereas PCOS in pregnancy is associated 
with increased risk of gestational diabetes, 
preeclampsia, 
pregnancy-induced 
hyper-
tension, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, 
miscarriage, and fetal and infant death;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4862 
September 20, 2022 
Whereas women with PCOS are at in-
creased risk of developing high blood pres-
sure, high cholesterol, stroke, and heart dis-
ease (the leading cause of death among 
women); 
Whereas women with PCOS have a more 
than 50 percent chance of developing type 2 
diabetes or prediabetes before the age of 40; 
Whereas women with PCOS may be at a 
higher risk for breast cancer and ovarian 
cancer, 
and 
their 
risk 
for 
developing 
endometrial cancer is 3 times higher than 
women who do not have PCOS; 
Whereas research has found genetic evi-
dence of a link between depression and 
PCOS; 
Whereas research has indicated PCOS 
shares a genetic architecture with metabolic 
traits, as evidenced by genetic correlations 
between PCOS and obesity, fasting insulin, 
type 2 diabetes, lipid levels, and coronary ar-
tery disease; 
Whereas adolescents with PCOS are at 
markedly increased risk for type 2 diabetes, 
fatty liver disease, and heart disease; 
Whereas PCOS negatively alters metabolic 
function independent of, but exacerbated by, 
an increased body mass index (BMI); 
Whereas an estimated 50 percent of women 
with PCOS are undiagnosed and many re-
main undiagnosed until they experience fer-
tility difficulties or develop type 2 diabetes 
or other cardiometabolic disorders; 
Whereas the cause of PCOS is unknown, 
but researchers have found strong links to a 
genetic predisposition and significant insulin 
resistance, which affects up to 70 percent of 
women with PCOS; and 
Whereas there is no known cure for PCOS: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes polycystic ovary syndrome 
(referred to in this resolution as ‘‘PCOS’’) as 
a serious disorder that impacts many aspects 
of health, including cardiometabolic, repro-
ductive, and mental health, and quality of 
life; 
(2) expresses support for the designation of 
September 
2022 
as 
‘‘PCOS 
Awareness 
Month’’; 
(3) supports the goals and ideals of PCOS 
Awareness Month, which are— 
(A) to increase awareness of, and education 
about, 
PCOS 
and 
its 
connection 
to 
comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, 
endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and mental 
health disorders, among the general public, 
women, girls, and health care professionals; 
(B) to improve diagnosis and treatment of 
PCOS; 
(C) to disseminate information on diag-
nosis, treatment, and management of PCOS, 
including prevention of comorbidities such 
as type 2 diabetes, endometrial cancer, car-
diovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease, and eating disorders; and 
(D) to improve quality of life and outcomes 
for women and girls with PCOS; 
(4) recognizes the need for further research, 
improved treatment and care options, and a 
cure for PCOS; 
(5) acknowledges the struggles affecting all 
women and girls who have PCOS in the 
United States; 
(6) urges medical researchers and health 
care professionals to advance their under-
standing of PCOS to improve research, diag-
nosis, and treatment of PCOS for women and 
girls; and 
(7) encourages States, territories, and lo-
calities to support the goals and ideals of 
PCOS Awareness Month.

mates the Hispanic population living in the 
50 States at more than 62,000,000 people, plus 
close to 3,200,000 people living in the Com-
monwealth of Puerto Rico, making Hispanic 
Americans approximately 19 percent of the 
total population of the United States and the 
largest racial or ethnic minority group in 
the United States; 
Whereas, in 2021, there were close to 
1,000,000 or more Latino residents in the

than 11,600,000 individuals, accounting for 
more than 1⁄2 of the total population growth 
of the United States during that period; 
Whereas the Latino population in the 
United States is projected to grow to 
111,200,000 people by 2060, at which point the 
Latino population will comprise more than 
28 percent of the total population of the 
United States; 
Whereas the Latino population in the 
United States is currently the third largest 
population of Latinos worldwide, exceeding 
the size of the population in every Latin 
American and Caribbean country, except 
Mexico and Brazil; 
Whereas, in 2020, there were more than 
18,630,000 Latino children under 18 years of 
age in the United States, which represents 
approximately 1⁄3 of the total Latino popu-

Whereas 27.5 percent of public school stu-
dents in the United States are Latino, and 
the share of Latino students is expected to 
rise to nearly 30 percent by 2027;

college students in the United States are 
Latino, making Latinos the second largest 
racial or ethnic minority group enrolled in 
higher education in the United States, in-
cluding 2-year community colleges and 4- 
year colleges and universities; 
Whereas, from 1996 to 2018, the number of 
Hispanic students enrolled in schools, col-
leges, and universities in the United States 
increased 
from 
8,800,000 
to 
more 
than 
18,000,000, and Hispanics now make up 25 per-
cent of all people enrolled in school in the

cent of the eligible electorate in the United 
States by 2036; 
Whereas, each year, approximately 800,000 
Latino citizens of the United States reach 18 
years of age and become eligible to vote, a 
number that could grow to 1,000,000 per year, 
potentially adding 10,000,000 new Latino vot-
ers by 2032; 
Whereas it is estimated that, in 2021, the 
annual purchasing power of Hispanic Ameri-
cans 
was 
$1,900,000,000,000, 
which 
is 
an 
amount greater than the economy of all ex-
cept 9 countries in the world; 
Whereas there are approximately 5,000,000 
Hispanic-owned businesses in the United

$800,000,000,000 in revenue to the economy of 
the United States; 
Whereas, by 2020, the number of Hispanic- 
owned businesses had grown by 34 percent

States; 
Whereas, as of August 2020, more than 
29,000,000 Latino workers represented 18 per-
cent of the total civilian labor force of the

UNITED STATES 
Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself, Mr. 
TESTER, Mr. HOEVEN, Mr. BROWN, Mr. 
WARNOCK, and Ms. ROSEN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 783 
Whereas, on August 1, 1907, the Aero-
nautical Division of the Army Signal Corps, 
consisting of 1 officer and 2 enlisted men, 
began operation under the command of Cap-
tain Charles deForest Chandler with the re-
sponsibility for ‘‘all matters pertaining to 
military ballooning, air machines, and all 
kindred subjects’’; 
Whereas, in 1908, the Department of War 
contracted with the Wright brothers to build 
1 heavier-than-air flying machine for the 
Army and, in 1909, the Department of War 
accepted the Wright Military Flyer, the first 
military airplane in the world; 
Whereas pilots of the United States, flying 
with both Allied air forces and with the 
Army Air Service, performed admirably dur-
ing the course of World War I, the first air 
war in history, by participating in pursuit, 
observation, and day and night bombing mis-
sions; 
Whereas pioneering aviators of the United 
States, including Mason M. Patrick, William 
‘‘Billy’’ 
Mitchell, 
Benjamin 
D. 
Foulois, 
Frank M. Andrews, Henry H. ‘‘Hap’’ Arnold, 
James H. ‘‘Jimmy’’ Doolittle, and Edward 
‘‘Eddie’’ Rickenbacker, were among the first 
individuals to recognize the military poten-
tial of airpower and, in the decades following 
World War I, courageously laid the founda-
tion for the creation of an independent arm 
for the air forces of the United States; 
Whereas General Henry H. ‘‘Hap’’ Arnold 
drew upon the industrial prowess and human 
resources of the United States to transform 
the Army Air Corps from a force of 22,000 
men and 3,900 aircraft in 1939, into an entity 
with a peak wartime strength of nearly 
2,500,000 personnel and 75,000 aircraft; 
Whereas, on June 20, 1941, the Department 
of War established the Army Air Forces as 
the aviation element of that Department 
and, shortly thereafter, the Department 
made the Army Air Forces co-equal to the 
Army Ground Forces; 
Whereas the standard for courage, flexi-
bility, and intrepidity in combat was estab-
lished for all airmen during the first aerial 
raid in the Pacific Theater on April 18, 1942, 
when Lieutenant Colonel James ‘‘Jimmy’’ H. 
Doolittle led 16 North American B–25 Mitch-
ell bombers in a joint operation from the 
deck of the USS Hornet to strike the Japa-
nese mainland in response to the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor; 
Whereas the National Security Act of 1947 
(50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), signed into law by 
President Harry S. Truman, realigned and 
reorganized the Armed Forces to establish 
the Department of the Air Force and the 
United States Air Force (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘USAF’’) as separate from 
other military services; 
Whereas, on September 18, 1947, W. Stuart 
Symington became the first Secretary of the 
newly formed and independent Air Force, 
marking the date on which the USAF was es-
tablished; 
Whereas the Air National Guard was also 
created by the National Security Act of 1947 
(50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) and has played a vital 
role in guarding the United States and de-
fending freedom in nearly every major con-
flict and contingency since its creation; 
Whereas, on October 14, 1947, the USAF 
demonstrated the historic and ongoing com-
mitment of the USAF to technological inno-
vation 
when 
Captain 
Charles 
‘‘Chuck’’ 
Yeager piloted the X–1 developmental rocket 
plane to a speed of Mach 1.06, becoming the 
first flyer to break the sound barrier in a 
powered aircraft in level flight; 
Whereas the Air Force Reserve, created on 
April 14, 1948, is comprised of citizen airmen 
who serve as unrivaled wingmen of the ac-
tive duty USAF during every deployment 
and on every mission and battlefield around 
the world in which the USAF is engaged; 
Whereas the USAF carried out the Berlin 
Airlift in 1948 and 1949 to provide humani-
tarian relief to post-war Germany and has 
established a tradition of offering humani-
tarian assistance when responding to natural 
disasters and needs across the world; 
Whereas the Tuskegee Airmen served the 
United States with tremendous dignity and 
honor, overcame segregation and prejudice 
to become one of the most highly respected 
fighter groups of World War II, and helped to 
establish a policy of racial integration with-
in the ranks of the USAF, as, on April 26, 
1948, the USAF became the first military 
branch to announce a policy of racial inte-
gration, a full 3 months before an executive 
order integrated all military services; 
Whereas, in the early years of the Cold 
War, the arsenal of bombers of the USAF, 
such as the long-range Convair B–58 Hustler 
and B–36 Peacemaker, and the Boeing B–47 
Stratojet and B–52 Stratofortress, served as 
the preeminent deterrent of the United 
States against the forces of the Soviet Union 
and were later augmented by the develop-
ment and deployment of medium range and 
intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as 
the Titan and Minuteman, developed by Gen-
eral Bernard A. Schriever; 
Whereas, on April 1, 1954, President Dwight 
D. 
Eisenhower 
signed 
legislation 
estab-
lishing the United States Air Force Acad-
emy, the mission of which is to educate, de-
velop, and inspire men and women to become 
aerospace officers and leaders of impeccable 
character and knowledge, and which, as of 
2022, has graduated 64 classes and commis-
sioned 53,491 officers into the USAF and 
United States Space Force (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘USSF’’); 
Whereas, during the Korean War, the 
USAF employed the first large-scale combat 
use of jet aircraft, helped to establish air su-
periority over the Korean Peninsula, pro-
tected ground forces of the United Nations 
with close air support, and interdicted 
enemy reinforcements and supplies; 
Whereas, during the Vietnam War, the 
USAF engaged in a limited campaign of air-
power to assist the South Vietnamese gov-
ernment in countering the communist Viet 
Cong guerillas and fought to disrupt supply 
lines, halt enemy ground offensives, and pro-
tect United States and Allied forces; 
Whereas, on April 3, 1967, former prisoner 
of war Paul W. Airey, a career radio oper-
ator, aerial gunner, and First Sergeant, be-
came the first Chief Master Sergeant of the 
USAF; 
Whereas, in recent decades, the USAF and 
coalition partners of the United States have 
supported successful actions in Grenada, 
Panama, Iraq, Kuwait, Somalia, Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, Haiti, Kosovo, Afghanistan, 
Libya, Syria, and many other locations 
around the world; 
Whereas USAF Special Operations Com-
mand has served with honor and distinction 
around the world since its activation in 1990, 
providing the United States with specialized 
airpower across the broad spectrum of con-
flicts in any place and at any time; 
Whereas, for over 3 decades beginning in 
1990, airmen engaged in continuous combat 
operations from Operation Desert Shield to 
Operation Inherent Resolve, demonstrating 
an air and space expeditionary force of out-
standing capability that is ready to fight and 
win wars and deter aggression whenever and 
wherever called upon; 
Whereas, when terrorists attacked the 
United States on September 11, 2001, fighter 
and air refueling aircraft of the USAF took 
to the skies to fly combat air patrols over 
major cities of the United States and protect 
the people of the United States from further 
attack; 
Whereas, on December 20, 2019, in recogni-
tion that space had become a warfighting do-
main, former President Donald Trump signed 
legislation establishing the USSF as an inde-
pendent service to ensure that the space do-
main remained open to all countries; 
Whereas, on May 30, 2020, in collaboration 
and engagement with interagency and com-
mercial partners, the USSF provided unpar-
alleled space launch capabilities in support 
of the first manned spaceflight from Amer-
ican soil in 9 years; 
Whereas, in 2021, in a step toward orga-
nizing the forces of the USSF to meet the 
needs of an independent military service de-
voted to space, the USSF activated Space

Operations Command, Space Systems Com-
mand, and Space Training and Readiness 
Command; 
Whereas, to establish a unique and endur-
ing culture for the USSF, the Department of 
the Air Force redesignated certain Air Force 
Bases and Air Force Stations supporting the 
USSF mission as Space Force Bases and 
Space Force Stations and graduated its first- 
ever basic military training course taught 
completely by USSF training instructors; 
Whereas space capabilities provide the 
foundation for everything the United States 
Armed Forces do, from humanitarian efforts 
to combat operations; 
Whereas, in 2022, following a ‘wings of hope 
and compassion’ tradition dating back more 
than a century, when airmen provided food 
and supplies to Texas flood victims in 1919, 
the USAF and coalition partners airlifted 
124,334 people out of Afghanistan in the larg-
est non-combatant evacuation airlift in 
United States history, spanning 17 days, 9 
countries, 8 time zones, and more than 10 
temporary safe havens; 
Whereas, since February 24, 2022, airmen 
and guardians have responded to Russian ag-
gression against Ukraine by guarding the 
skies of members of the North Atlantic Trea-
ty Organization (commonly referred to as 
‘‘NATO’’), transporting essential equipment 
to the Ukrainian military, and providing 
critical support from space; 
Whereas women have played a prominent 
role in the evolution of the Department of 
the Air Force, courageously fighting along-
side their male counterparts and dedicating 
their lives to protecting peace, liberty, and 
freedom around the world as they provide air 
and space power whenever and wherever 
needed; 
Whereas the Department of the Air Force 
has made tremendous strides in the global 
warfighting domain of cyberspace by revolu-
tionizing offensive and defensive capabilities 
and effects with speed, agility, and surgical 
precision, thereby ensuring the continuous 
command, control, and execution of oper-
ations in contested, degraded, and limited 
environments; 
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol, as a Total 
Force partner and auxiliary of the USAF, 
has maintained a steadfast commitment to 
the United States and the communities of 
the United States through a proud legacy of 
service, from the earliest days of World War 
II, when the Civil Air Patrol protected the 
shorelines of the United States, through 2022, 
as the Civil Air Patrol executes emergency 
service missions and aerospace education 
programs; 
Whereas the Department of the Air Force 
is steadfast in the commitment to fielding a 
world-class air and space expeditionary force 
by recruiting, training, and educating its of-
ficer, enlisted, and civilian corps comprising 
the active duty, Guard, and Reserve compo-
nents of the Total Force; 
Whereas airmen were imprisoned and tor-
tured during several major conflicts, includ-
ing World War I, World War II, the Vietnam 
War, the Korean War, and the Persian Gulf 
War, and, in the valiant tradition of airmen 
held captive, continued serving the United 
States with honor and dignity under the 
most inhumane circumstances; 
Whereas airmen have earned the Medal of 
Honor 19 times, the Air Force Cross 203 
times, the Distinguished Service Cross 42 
times, and, since September 11, 2001, the Sil-
ver Star 92 times; 
Whereas the USAF and the USSF are tre-
mendous stewards of resources in developing 
and applying groundbreaking technology to 
manage complex acquisition programs for all 
air and space weapon systems throughout 
their life cycles; 
Whereas talented and dedicated airmen 
and guardians will continue to make the in-
vestments necessary to accelerate trans-
formation and modernization to counter the 
adversaries of the United States and meet 
the future challenges of an ever-changing 
world with limitless strength, resolve, and 
patriotism; 
Whereas the USAF and the USSF are com-
mitted to accelerating change and preparing 
for the future, because failure is not an op-
tion; 
Whereas, on every continent around the 
world, airmen and guardians have bravely 
fought for freedom, liberty, and peace, pre-
served democracy, and protected the people 
and interests of the United States; 
Whereas the future success of the United 
States Armed Forces depends upon the abil-
ity to control the air and space domains; 
Whereas airmen and guardians will con-
tinue to be a tremendous resource for the 
United States in fights across every domain 
and at every location, thereby ensuring the 
safety and security of the United States; and 
Whereas, for 75 years, the airmen and 
guardians of the Department of the Air 
Force, through their exemplary service and 
sacrifice, have repeatedly proven their value 
to the United States, the people of the 
United States, the allies of the United 
States, and all free people of the world: Now,

559 Hispanic-Serving Institutions operated in 
the United States, the District of Columbia, 
and 
Puerto 
Rico, 
enrolling 
more 
than 
3,500,000 Hispanic students, according to the 
Hispanic Association of Colleges and Univer-
sities and Excelencia in Education; 
Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are 
engines of economic mobility and a major 
contributor to the economic prosperity of 
the United States; 
Whereas, according to the Hispanic Asso-
ciation of Colleges and Universities, His-

mathematics 
(commonly 
known

SENATE RESOLUTION 786—RECOG-
NIZING THE HISTORY OF WOM-
EN’S PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL 
IN INDIANA 
Mr. BRAUN submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
S. RES. 786 
Whereas the All American Girls Profes-
sional Baseball League (referred to as the 
‘‘League’’) has significant history in Indiana 
and the History Museum in South Bend 
holds the largest collection of memorabilia 
from the League; 
Whereas the League was established during 
World War II to provide a morale boost and 
family entertainment to aid in the war effort 
and gained popularity throughout the 1940s; 
Whereas, in 1943, South Bend, Indiana be-
came the fourth city to have a team com-
peting in the League, the first women’s pro-
fessional baseball league in the history of 
the United States; 
Whereas South Bend was home to the Blue 
Sox for all 12 years of the existence of the 
League and the Blue Sox played at Bendix 
Field and Playland Park in South Bend, In-
diana; 
Whereas Fort Wayne was eager to bring a 
team to the city and the Fort Wayne Daisies 
debuted in 1945, with games held at North 
Side High School and later Memorial Park in 
Fort Wayne; 
Whereas the South Bend Blue Sox were 
both the League and playoff champions for 
the 1951 season and were the playoff cham-
pions for the 1952 season; 
Whereas the Fort Wayne Daises were the 
league champions for the 1952, 1953, and 1954 
seasons; 
Whereas Dorothy ‘‘Dottie’’ Schroeder was 
the only woman who played all 12 seasons in 
the League and became a favorite player of 
fans of the South Bend Blue Sox, the Keno-
sha Comets, the Fort Wayne Daisies, and the 
Kalamazoo Lassies; 
Whereas the 1992 American sports comedy- 
drama film about the League, ‘‘A League of 
Their Own’’ was partially filmed in Indiana 
and was added to the National Film Registry 
by the Library of Congress in 2012; 
Whereas scenes from ‘‘A League of Their 
Own’’ of home games of the Rockford Peach-
es were filmed at League Stadium in 
Huntingburg, Indiana; and 
Whereas the championship game between 
Rockford and Racine in ‘‘A League of Their 
Own’’ was filmed at Bosse Field in Evans-
ville, Indiana, which is the third oldest base-
ball park in the country still in use for pro-
fessional baseball, behind only Fenway Park 
and Wrigley Field: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that Indiana played a signifi-
cant role in the history of the All American 
Girls Professional Baseball League during 
the existence of the league through the suc-
cessful teams in Indiana: the South Bend 
Blue Sox and the Fort Wayne Daisies; and 
(2) encourages people throughout Indiana 
to continue to honor and recognize the his-
tory and legacy of women’s professional 
baseball through preservation of memora-
bilia, facilities, and events that highlight the 
era of such professional athletes.

(bb) a current working email address; or 
(cc) other means of direct electronic mes-
saging (which may be provided to such seller

quested and received a provision for a partial 
disclosure under subparagraph (A) has not 
provided responsive answers within a reason-

quirements to provide and disclose informa-
tion under this subsection, the online mar-
ketplace shall, after providing the seller 
with written or electronic notice and an op-
portunity to provide or disclose such infor-

sales activity of such seller until the seller 
complies with such requirements.

ceptive act or practice prescribed under sec-

sion Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).

WELCOMING GOVERNOR SAMUEL 
ALEJANDRO GARCI´A SEPU´ LVEDA 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to 
welcome 
Samuel 
Alejandro 
Garcı´a 
Sepu´lveda, governor of the Mexican state of 
Nuevo Leo´n, to the House of Representatives. 
Nuevo Leo´n has a significant economic foot-
print. It’s a leader in education and several 
major industries. It’s also home to Monterrey, 
Mexico’s second-largest metropolitan area. 
But folks back home in Laredo know Nuevo 
Leo´n for different reason: it’s our neighbor 
across the border. Governor Garcı´a has a 
central role to play both at home and in U.S.- 
Mexico relations, and I am honored to wel-
come him here today. 
The Laredo-Colombia Solidarity International 
Bridge, which spans from Nuevo Leo´n to my 
hometown of Laredo, is a critical artery for 
North American trade. With this visit, Governor 
Garcı´a is strengthening the bond between 
Nuevo Leo´n and Laredo, and between the 
U.S. and Mexico—not only in the realm of 
trade, 
but 
also 
security 
cooperation, 
healthcare, and more. 
At just 34 years old, Governor Garcı´a is al-
ready an accomplished attorney, a former 
local deputy and senator in Nuevo Leo´n, and 
the author of several books. He has a bold vi-
sion for his state and for his country. By in-
vesting in education, infrastructure, and sus-
tainable growth, Governor Garcı´a is putting 
Nuevo Leo´n on the path toward a more pros-
perous future. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to 
join me in welcoming Governor Garcı´a to the 
House of Representatives. Governor Garcı´a is 
a truly committed public servant with a bright 
future. I look forward to working with him to 
deepen the ties between our two communities 
and our two countries.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, on Sep-
tember 19, 2022, I missed one roll call vote. 
Had I been present, I would have voted YES 
on Roll Call No. 438, on Passage of S. 
3895—United States Commission on Inter-
national Religious Freedom Reauthorization 
Act of 2022. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MARTA 
PERMUY 
HON. MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Ms. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, Marta 
Permuy was born on September 22, 1938. 
She would have turned 84 this Thursday. 
While she may have passed on from this life, 
I want to ensure she remains immortalized in 
history by telling her story. To be recognized 
in a place where democracy is held sacred 
and steadfast seems like a fitting birthday 
present for a woman who understood that true 
art is born of free societies. 
Marta was a Cuban American Fine Arts Pa-
tron based in Coral Gables, a prominent part 
of Miami-Dade County, and a part of my dis-
trict. Marta’s heart was that of an activist, 
which explains her natural inclination for art. 
Why limit yourself to the ears of an audience 
when they have eyes? 
Born and raised in Cuba, Marta was a wit-
ness to the rise of the Communist regime. 
This led her to became active in the MRR, the 
Movement for Revolutionary Recovery, a lead-
ing force of resistance against the regime. She 
was among the few women given a central 
role in the organization’s leadership. Upon re-
alizing that their efforts would not be able to 
contain the regime, she fled to Venezuela with 
her family. In 1962, she resettled in South 
Florida where she would go on to open an art 
gallery, the Permuy Gallery. The Permuy Gal-
lery became a home for innovative art, particu-
larly from Cuban artists. In the evenings, after 
exhibitions, it hosted gatherings for South Flor-
ida’s notable figures, to discuss art in its vary-
ing forms, whether it was painted on a canvas, 
written in literature, prayed in spiritual realms, 
or argued in politics. This was a significant 
meeting point for the community, especially for 
the Cuban exiles in Miami. 
After the Gallery closed, Marta devoted her-
self to her children. Eventually, the art world 
would call her back home to the Permuy 
House, where she would carry out her art ven-
tures for over 40 years. In 2021, The Permuy 
House was designated a landmark of the City 
of Coral Gables. 
Her legacy lives on through her children, 
who remain involved in the arts, and seek to 
honor their mother through different cultural 
events in South Florida. May this record aid in 
preserving her spirit, and to inspire artists to 
understand that all talent, even unconven-
tional, is useful to the cause of preserving a 
free and just society. 
CONGRESSIONAL VETERANS 
COMMENDATION 
HON. VERN BUCHANAN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize a group of veterans for their military 
and community service. 
Our veterans have sacrificed much in the 
defense of our nation. Many of them retired 
their uniforms but continued their service by 
helping others in their community. 
I recently established the 16th District Con-
gressional Veteran Commendation program to 
recognize the heroic wartime sacrifices and 
admirable peacetime community involvement 
of my constituents. 
An independent panel reviewed several 
nominations and chose the following six vet-
erans for their wartime and post-military serv-
ice: 
Edward J. Mahoney of Sun City Center who 
served in the U.S. Marine Corps during World 
War II 
John V. Skeen of Bradenton who served in 
the U.S. Army during World War II 
John J. Brill of Longboat Key who served in 
the U.S. Army during the Korean War 
Richard J. Petrucci of Lakewood Ranch who 
served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam 
War 
Richard M. Swier of Sarasota who served in 
the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War 
David W. Daily of Bradenton who served in 
the U.S. Army during the Gulf War 
These are exceptional Americans. I appre-
ciate the opportunity to honor them for their 
service to the Nation and community.

HONORING MORGAN ROUTMAN 
AND ALEXANDER HILL 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Morgan 
Routman and Alexander Hill on the occasion 
of their marriage. Morgan has been an impor-
tant member of my team for three years, start-
ing as a Communications Assistant and now 
an exceptional Communications Director. 
Morgan, at age 15 from Florida, and Alex, at 
age 15 from Maryland, met ten years ago at 
Kutz, a leadership camp for reform Jewish 
teens. One thousand miles apart, they spent 
their high school years dating long distance 
making sure they were together for special 
moments like proms. 
After high school, they both attended 
George Washington University in D.C., allow-
ing their relationship to grow stronger and 
stronger. After graduation, they moved in to-
gether and added Bourbon, a sweet Pitbull, to 
their family.

CHUCK EALEY 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate Chuck Ealey, Portsmouth, Ohio 
native, on his induction to the United States 
College Football Hall of Fame. 
Chuck was undefeated during his time as 
quarterback at Notre Dame High School in 
Portsmouth. He opted to attend the University 
of Toledo and led is team to 35 straight vic-
tories from 1969 to 1971 and three straight 
Tangerine Bowl victories during that span. In 
his final year at Toledo, Chuck was named 
First Team All-American by Football News, 
Third Team All-American by the Associated 
Press, and was a finalist for the 1971 
Heisman Trophy. 
Chuck later played in the Canadian Football 
League (CFL) and led his team to a victory in 
the 60th Grey Cup in the 1972 season, earn-
ing the Grey Cup’s Most Valuable Player 
award along the way. His number 16 was re-
tired at Toledo, and to this day, no other col-
lege quarterback has won 35 games in a row. 
During his time at Toledo, in the CFL, and 
in his business ventures since football, Chuck 
has exemplified determination and integrity, 
and shown what it truly means to be a leader 
of a team. 
Congratulations to Chuck and his family on 
his well-deserved induction to the United 
States College Football Hall of Fame Class of 
2022. I look forward to seeing where the fu-
ture will take him.

SEPTEMBER CONSTITUENT OF 
THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Edward Becerra as 
my September Constituent of the Month. As 
we begin another school year, we must con-
tinue to support and uplift the work of local 
community leaders who are going above and 
beyond to help our region thrive. During the 
pandemic, many kids fell behind on key edu-
cational markers, including literacy. Edward’s 
work with Education Begins in the Home is 
critical to ensuring all families in my District 
have access to age-appropriate books for their 
children. 
Edward’s program, Education Begins in the 
Home, aims to increase literacy in the Latino 
community through access to free books. The 
program is one of several under non-profit 
Empowering Latino Futures, whose mission is 
to remove barriers to educational and profes-
sional success for Latino communities. He 
started Education Begins in the Home in May 
of 2015 after learning that 60 percent of low- 
income families in the county at the time did 
not own a book at home according to the San 
Diego Council on Literacy. To address this 
problem, Edward partners with community or-
ganizations to gather books and hosts ‘book 
sorting parties’ with volunteers to later dis-
tribute them in the community. Since its found-
ing, his program has hosted 700 events and 
distributed 176,500 free books to children in 
North County San Diego. I’m proud that my of-
fice was able to secure books for Edward’s 
program through the Library of Congress Sur-
plus Books program. 
During Hispanic Heritage Month, I am proud 
to uplift Edward Becerra and other Latino 
voices who contribute to our unique and di-
verse district. I’m so grateful for CA–49 resi-
dents who dedicate their time to the better-
ment of our community, and I’m proud to 
honor Edward Becerra as my September Con-
stituent of the Month.

HONORING CARLOS TAMAYO 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Carlos Tamayo. 
Through the creation of La Tortilla Factory 
with his family, Mr. Tamayo helped contribute 
to his community by increasing the diversity of 
cuisine in the area, providing jobs and liveli-
hoods for so many. 
Mr. Tamayo was born in Nebraska in 1946 
to a family of five sons. After attending college 
in Arizona, Mr. Tamayo and his wife moved to 
Fremont, California, where they found inspira-
tion to partner with his parents to create La 
Tortilla Factory, 
La Tortilla Factory was founded in August of 
1977 in Santa Rosa, California. It began as a 
family-run restaurant owned by Mr. Tamayo’s 
parents, and siblings, and quickly expanded 
into a business that focused solely on pro-
ducing tortillas. The factory’s growth led to 
more than 300 new job opportunities for the 
local community. 
Mr. Tamayo has dedicated his life and work 
to helping others through a variety of roles. He 
served in the United States Army during the 
Vietnam War from 1969 to 1971. After earning 
his master’s degree, he took on a job as a fi-
nancial analyst at the National Economic De-
velopment Association and worked to help 
Latino individuals who were interested in a ca-
reer in business. 
Mr. Tamayo was heavily involved in deci-
sion-making and financial components of La 
Tortilla Factory, and served as the business’ 
Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and Presi-
dent throughout its duration. La Tortilla Fac-
tory’s success as the main tortilla distributor 
for the United States is in part due to Mr. 
Tamayo’s expertise. 
Mr. Tamayo was well-known in his commu-
nity, and will be remembered as friendly, pas-
sionate, and incredibly intelligent. He was 
dedicated to his family, and travel was a huge 
part of his life. Mr. Tamayo was also inspired 
by his parents. They raised a family and 
achieved success in the United States after 
his father immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico 
through the Bracero program, and his moth-

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as a Ranking Member of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, I am grateful to recognize 
the Centennial of Egypt and the United States 
with diplomatic relations. 
Egypt is a friend, an ally, and an important 
economic and regional security partner of the 
United States. Over the past 100 years, Egypt 
has been a strategic partner in advancing 
peace in the Middle East and the Eastern 
Mediterranean. 
Trade ties between America and Egypt have

United States was Egypt’s second largest 
trading partner and our largest export market 
in Africa, with a total bilateral trade volume 
standing at 9.1 billion dollars. Egyptian invest-
ment in innovation and commitment to eco-
nomic prosperity has led to important develop-
ment in oil and gas exploration and produc-
tion, as well as renewable energy technologies 
and production. It is significant Egypt’s newest 
satellite, Nilesat 301, successfully launched a 
Space X Launcher from the Space Force sta-
tion in Cape Canaveral, Florida, initiating 
greater progress in space technologies. 
Last week I had the pleasure of attending 
the Embassy of Egypt’s 100 Year Diplomatic 
Relations Reception at the Library of Con-
gress hosted by Ambassador Motaz Zahran. 
Ambassador Zahran is highly respected in 
Washington with Deputy Chief of Mission 
Abdelrahman Raafat and Counselor Ahmed 
Abu Moussa. It was an honor to join them in 
celebrating the Centennial of Egypt and the 
United States diplomatic relations, and I look 
forward to continuing the advancement of our 
partnership. 
I am thankful the United States and Egypt 
remain close allies for mutual benefit, and I 
would like to again recognize this years’ Cen-
tennial of our partnership.

REMEMBERING JOHN VOSS 
HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I want to 
honor and pay tribute to the life and accom-
plishments of John Everett Voss, Jr., a com-
munity leader and businessman from my con-
gressional district, who passed away on Sep-
tember 11, 2022. 
John Voss was a pillar of the Dayton com-
munity. He founded Voss Chevrolet with his 
father, John, Sr. in Centerville, Ohio in 1972. 
Voss Auto Network grew into the biggest auto 
group in the Dayton/Miami Valley region and 
became one of the top 100 dealers nationwide 
in sales volume, providing jobs to many, with 
nine franchised dealerships in Southwest 
Ohio. 
Throughout his life, John and his family 
have strived to better our community and help 
others. In 2016, he launched an annual car 
show called the Voss Hoss Cruise-in, with the 
proceeds benefiting the Fisher Houses at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and AIM for 
the Handicapped. 
John received the Dayton Entrepreneur of 
the Year award, the Ohio Auto Dealers Asso-
ciation award, and was named a Time Maga-
zine Quality Dealer for his outstanding busi-
ness performance and involvement in the 
community. 
When asked what the secret of his business 
success was, John answered: ‘‘Putting the 
customers first, knowing our market, hiring 
and training good employees, and treating 
them right—thus creating an environment at 
the dealerships that fosters wonderful em-
ployee morale and excellent customer serv-
ice.’’ 
My heartfelt condolences are with John’s 
wife Gail; his sons Craig and Brad, and all 
those who knew him and called him a friend. 
I include in the RECORD the following obituary, 
as it was published in the Dayton Daily News: 
John Voss, the founder and co-owner of the 
Voss Auto Network, died Sunday. He was 79. 
The network, a family-owned and operated 
business, is comprised of Voss Chevrolet, 
Voss Cadillac, Voss BMW, Voss Toyota, Voss 
Honda, Voss Hyundai and Joe Morgan Honda. 
Sons Craig and Brad Voss have been co-own-
ers since 2010. 
‘‘Dad had the biggest heart of anyone I 
ever knew,’’ Craig Voss told Dayton Daily 
News. ‘‘It was interesting though, because he 
was very quiet about it. What he would do 
for his employees, for his friends, for count-
less charitable organizations . . . I can’t 
begin to tell you how much he did, but he did 
it very privately and very quietly.’’ 
His father didn’t desire recognition, he 
said. ‘‘That wasn’t why he was he was doing 
what he did,’’ Craig Voss said. 
John Voss had a way of looking at things 
in the business world in a way in which other 
people just couldn’t, he said. 
‘‘He was very driven, but he also had a way 
of seeing opportunities where nobody else 
saw them,’’ Craig Voss said. ‘‘He just had 
this set of morals and ethics that not only 
guided him but really, he found people that 
shared those values, and he placed them all 
throughout the organization and then he just 
let them operate within the business as if it 
were their own.’’ 
John Voss was born on Nov. 3, 1942, near 
Chicago. He launched his automotive career 
in Evanston, Illinois, and on 1972, he and his 
father purchased land in Centerville and 
opened Voss Chevrolet. 
After the death of his father, Voss spent 
the next several decades building Voss Auto 
Network into the largest auto group in the 
Dayton/Miami Valley area, one that has ap-
proximately 500 employees across its seven 
locations, Craig Voss said. 
That included Joe Morgan Honda built in 
2010 in Monroe by Voss and the late Cin-
cinnati Reds second baseman Joe Morgan, a 
good friend and a Baseball Hall of Fame in-
ductee. He also established the Voss Colli-
sion Centre, which he grew into one of the 
largest dealer-owner collision repair facili-
ties in the United States. 
Voss was recognized as a leader and inno-
vator in the automotive industry, company 
officials said. 
Craig Voss said his father’s death came un-
expectedly after a brief hospitalization at 
Kettering Health Miamisburg. 
‘‘The nurses, the doctors and the staff . . . 
I can’t say enough about them and the love 
and caring that they provided to us over the 
last couple of weeks,’’ he said. John Voss is 
survived by his wife Gail, sons Brad (Lisa) 
Voss and Craig (Jessica) Voss and three 
grandchildren.

UPHOLDING THE DAYTON PEACE 
AGREEMENT 
THROUGH 
SANC-
TIONS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 8453, the Up-
holding the Dayton Peace Accords through 
Sanctions Act. I want to begin by thanking the 
Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Greg-
ory Meeks, and my colleagues, Representa-
tives Wagner and Wilde, for their leadership 
on this issue and for bringing this bill to the 
floor. 
Twenty-seven years ago, thanks to the lead-
ership of President Bill Clinton, the Dayton Ac-
cords were signed, officially marking the end 
of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today, 
however, we still have domestic and foreign 
actors threatening to undermine the accords’ 
legitimacy. I am concerned that any challenge 
to the agreements laid out in the accords 
poses a severe risk to the relative stability of 
the Western Balkans. For the region’s sake, 
we cannot afford to let these bad actors go 
unpunished. 
That’s why I believe that the House of Rep-
resentatives—and 
our 
government 
as 
a 
whole—must continue to support the Euro-
pean integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
This is a necessary step and one that I hope 
will eventually lead to them joining the Euro-
pean Union and NATO. 
As a Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus 
on Bosnia and Herzegovina, I have seen the 
incredible progress that this young country has 
made over the past quarter century. Yes, the 
situation is far from perfect; corruption issues 
linger, and young, educated people continue 
to leave in search of a better life. But, Mr. 
Speaker, progress is often slow and incre-
mental. With our enduring support, I am opti-
mistic for their future. 
Fortunately, H.R. 8453 provides for that 
support—and more. The bill recognizes it as 
the policy of the United States to support a 
unified, sovereign, and multiethnic Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. It also strengthens the sanction 
tools available to Administrations to ensure 
lasting peace and security in the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill and hope for a swift passage in 
the Senate.

Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to

years of service to children and the community 
as a whole. 
Originally chartered as the Manatee River 
Kiwanis Club on August 22, 1922, by Kiwanis 
International, the club later changed its name 
to the Bradenton Kiwanis Club. For the past 
century, the club’s members have been com-

positive difference by identifying and meeting 
the needs of local youth and Manatee County. 
In the early years, the club established a 
Christmas Charity Fund for underprivileged 
children and began supporting Boy Scouts, 
Girl Scouts, and other programs for children. 
The Club also brought the Manatee County 
and DeSoto County Commissions together to 
build a paved, 50-mile road between Bra-
denton and Arcadia. 
During the Great Depression, the Club es-
tablished, funded, and operated a Health 
Camp for underprivileged children. 
During the height of the depression, to pro-
mote tourism and improve the local economy, 
the Club worked with the City of Bradenton to 
establish, fund, and operate the Bradenton 
Trailer Park, which was one of the largest trail-
er parks in the world until it was sold in 1997. 
In 1947, the Club established and funded 
the Boys Club of Manatee County and con-
tinues to support it. 
In 1990, the Bradenton Kiwanis Foundation 
was established, and when it received the net 
proceeds from the sale of the trailer park, it 
continued to use the interest income to donate 
to local nonprofit organizations who provide for 
children and the disadvantaged. The founda-
tion has contributed nearly $7 million to im-
prove the lives of Bradenton’s young people, 
including the Boys and Girls Clubs of Man-
atee, K-Kids, Builders Clubs, the Boy Scouts, 
the Girl Scouts, the YMCA, Kids Against Hun-
ger, Salvation Army, Headstart, Meals on 
Wheels, the Salvation Army and others. 
The Club has further demonstrated its com-
mitment to children and the community by 
building parks, partnering with Habitat for Hu-
manity to build houses, supporting the Bishop 
Museum, partnering with the Manatee County 
Chamber of Commerce to establish a leader-
ship program, launching the College & Career 
Resource Center at Manatee Memorial High 
School, participating in Big Brothers Big Sis-
ters’ student mentoring program and funding 
numerous scholarship programs. 
The club has also contributed to capital 
campaigns to support the construction of a 
new Bradenton Civic Center, a Girl Scout 
House, the Anna Maria Island Community 
center, Manatee Performing Arts Center and 
to purchase land for the Boys Club, United 
Way, and YMCA. 
On behalf of the people of Florida’s 16th 
District, I congratulate the Bradenton Kiwanis 
Club on their 100th anniversary and applaud 
its members for the positive impact they have 
had on the community.

HONORING THE NORTH BAY 
REGIONAL CENTER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 20, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor North Bay Re-
gional Center for 50 years of service to indi-
viduals with intellectual and developmental 
disabilities and their families. This organization 
has demonstrated their commitment to helping 
those in need by providing the resources nec-
essary for these individuals and their families 
to thrive. 
The North Bay Regional Center is part of a 
system of centers that were created in 1965 
and spread throughout the State of California. 
This center was founded in 1972, and specifi-
cally provides services to individuals in Napa, 
Solano, and Sonoma County. The priority of 
the center is to provide support for these indi-
viduals and their families through the Early 
Start program and the Lanterman Act pro-
gram. 
Early Start is focused on helping children 
under 3 years old who have or are more at 
risk of experiencing a developmental disability. 
These children are given the tools they need 
to thrive in their home environments and other 
areas they may frequent. The Lanterman Act 
program is concentrated on supporting individ-
uals who are 3 years old or older. Combined, 
these programs provide continual support and 
continue to advocate for these individuals from 
birth to late adulthood. 
Over 10,000 individuals are receiving help 
from the North Bay Regional Center alone. As 
a result, individuals with various disabilities are 
able to gain access to the resources they 
need to become more independent and in-
cluded in their community. 
The North Bay Regional Center has played 
an important role in the lives of individuals 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities 
by encouraging the involvement of these indi-
viduals in their own communities, which in turn 
will only continue to encourage growth and 
inclusivity. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that North Bay 
Regional Center has been instrumental in pro-
viding support to the people that it serves. 
Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor 
it here today.

GREG SCHNEIDER 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP

Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Greg Schneider, a UPS 
employee and CEO and Founder of Operation 
Ramp It Up, on earning the Jim Casey Com-
munity Service Award, the UPS’ highest com-
munity service honor. 
Operation Ramp it Up has helped veterans 
with physical disabilities and their families stay 
in their homes by providing access and equip-
ment they need to move about as independ-
ently and freely as possible. A few years ago, 
Operation Ramp it Up began installing ramps 
for civilians as well. 
The dedication of Greg and other volunteers 
like him has made a profound difference for 
communities across 42 U.S. states. In 2020, I 
have been fortunate to join Greg Schneider 
and his team for multiple ramp builds over the 
years in Southwest Ohio. I was impressed by 
their commitment. 
Their work has led to the installation of over 
150 wheelchair ramps. They will stop at noth-
ing until they have built ramps in all 50 states 
and helped as many people and families as 
possible. 
Again, congratulations to Greg on his well- 
deserved award for his work on Operation 
Ramp it Up.
