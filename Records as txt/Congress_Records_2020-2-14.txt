IN MEMORY OF FRED O. PLACKE 
III 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Fred O. Placke Ill. 
He was a businessman, educator, realtor, 
public servant and humanitarian. 
As a college student at Tarleton State in 
Stephenville, Texas, Mr. Placke and a small 
group of fellow football players distributed do-
nated gifts to children at a local foster home. 
Over the past four decades, he expanded that 
initial charitable endeavor into an annual com-
munity Christmas event in Goldthwaite, Texas 
as he and a multitude of volunteer ‘‘elves’’ de-
livered moving trucks full of thousands of pre-
sents for children at the New Horizons Foster 
Home. 
After graduation, Mr. Placke returned to his 
hometown of Spring Woods where he taught 
history and coached football. Later in his 
teaching career, he taught U.S. government at 
Marcus High School in Flower Mound, Texas 
and was voted ‘‘Teacher of the Year’’ in 1997. 
Two years later, he was elected to the 
Lewisville ISD Board of Trustees and subse-
quently served for twelve years; six of those 
years, he led the Board as President. Fred 
Placke was a passionate educator, dedicated 
leader and active community volunteer. He 
was a beloved husband, father and grand-
father and will be sorely missed by his family 
and friends to whom I extend my sincere con-
dolences.

HONORING DANIEL C. WEBER 
HON. DANIEL WEBSTER 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and service of 
Daniel C. Weber, veteran, husband, father, 
grandfather, entrepreneur, visionary and giant 
in the conservative movement. Dan passed 
away in February. He embodied the American 
dream: humble and optimistic, resilient and re-
solved, hopeful and quick to give. Dan was 
never without a ready smile, never without ap-
preciation for good fortune, never without faith 
in America, his fellow Americans, and his lov-
ing God. 
Believing that Americans aged 50-plus de-
served better representation in DC, Dan and 
his wife Judy created AMAC—the Association 
of Mature American Citizens for Americans. 
AMAC is the voice for individuals concerned 
with the spread of big government and its in-
trusion into their daily lives, the erosion of per-
sonal liberties and disregard for the Constitu-
tion, a document Dan believed to be the great-
est ever conceived by mankind. Dan envi-
sioned AMAC to be a right-of-center, member- 
driven organization with an unwavering focus 
on the best interests of its membership. 
From very humble beginnings in 2007, 
today AMAC has a membership of over 2 mil-
lion people residing in every state of the coun-
try and it continues to grow. AMAC’s common- 
sense, free-market approach to the problems 
facing the country resonates with Americans 
looking for an organization that holds their val-
ues of faith, family and freedom in the same 
high regard. 
Dan Weber was an American success story 
and pillar of the conservative movement. We 
are grateful for the example he set. May he 
rest in peace knowing that his ‘‘good fight’’ to 
preserve America’s best will continue. I am 
confident his beloved AMAC army will grow 
ever stronger, bigger and more resolved to 
see the mission through.

TRUMP BUDGET CUTS TO SNAP 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to speak for our food insecure families. 
Federal anti-hunger programs like SNAP 
play a vital role in the lives of 12th District 
families, but the Trump Budget slashes $182 
billion from food assistance programs. 
President Trump’s proposal to cut SNAP 
benefits comes on the heels of three USDA 
rules which will cut benefits for almost 4 mil-
lion Americans and jeopardize 1 million chil-
dren’s access to free school breakfast and 
lunch. 
These are real people they’re hurting. These 
are our children, our friends, our neighbors. 
Here’s the sad truth: this President wants to 
pay for his billionaire tax cuts by letting chil-
dren starve. 
A couple months ago, I visited Windsor Park 
Elementary School in Charlotte as they were 
putting together their first food pantry for stu-
dents. 
Of their 650 students, many are homeless 
and 150 have immediate needs. 
Their food pantry was put together because 
students kept asking their teachers and ad-
ministrators for food. 
Principal Shanna Rae told a local TV station 
that ‘‘you can tell a difference in students 
when they have something to eat.’’ 
That’s not Oliver Twist: sadly, that’s our 
community. 
Over 20 million children across our country 
rely on SNAP. 
Instead of cutting SNAP, we should expand 
it, so that children and families don’t have to 
worry about where their next meal is going to 
come from. 
Scripture tells us that Jesus said, ‘‘Let the 
little children come to me, and do not hinder 
them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to 
such as these.’’ 
How can we expect them to do that if they 
have nothing to eat?

HONORING MARGARET WHELCHER 
AS A VETERAN AND AS A PART 
OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Margaret Patricia Whelcher for 
her achievements in the United States Air 
Force for Black History Month. Ms. Whelcher 
served from August 3, 1988 to November 5, 
1991 and earned the rank of Senior Airman. 
Senior Airman Whelcher trained at Lackland 
Air Force Base and Langley Air Force Base, 
and was part of the 1913 Communications 
Group. Her dedication and passion are evi-
dent, I commend Senior Airman Whelcher for 
her service and honor her as a part of the 
Black History Month Program in Rockford 
called ‘‘Capturing American History: The 
Unique Perspective of the African American 
Female Service Member.’’ I would like to 
thank Senior Airman Whelcher for her service 
and recognize her for her experiences as an 
African American, female service member. 
It is because of community leaders like Mar-
garet that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally honor 
Margaret Patricia Whelcher for her service in 
the United States Air Force.

IN RECOGNITION OF CAPTAIN 
DAVID OWEN 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the exemplary work and life 
of service of Captain David Owen of the Uni-
versity of North Texas Police Department in 
Denton, Texas. 
Captain David Owen began his law enforce-
ment career with the Titus County Sheriff’s Of-
fice in 2004. He was hired by the University of 
North Texas Police Department on June 13, 
2005 as a Police Officer. He served the UNT 
students, faculty, and staff until his death on 
February 11, 2020 after a courageous battle 
with cancer. 
Captain Owen received a bachelor’s degree 
in criminal justice and political science from 
Midwestern State University and a graduate 
certification in criminal justice education from 
the University of Virginia. He also attended 
several leadership training programs including 
the 270th session of the FBI National Acad-
emy, the International Association of Campus 
Law Enforcement Administrators Executive

Development Institute and the Institute for Law 
Enforcement Administration’s School of Police 
Supervision. 
At the time of his death, Captain Owen su-
pervised the Field Services unit of the police 
department, overseeing patrol and special 
events planning. His prior roles in the depart-
ment include serving as Support Services Unit 
Supervisor, Criminal Investigator and Patrol 
Officer. Captain Owen was a certified TCOLE 
Master Peace Officer and Police Instructor. He 
had served on UNT’s Student Support Task 
Force, and earned a Police Commendation 
and the Excellence in Public Service award, 
as well as being recognized by MADD (Moth-
ers Against Drunk Driving). 
David Owen was extremely tough and resil-
ient in his last fight, a reflection of the type of 
person he was—dedicated to performing the 
job well and to the best of his abilities. He 
stood up for what he believed was right but 
was always thoughtful enough to consider the 
viewpoints of others. He believed strongly in 
educating himself and others so that clear and 
informed decisions could be made. He is sur-
vived by his wife Joy and their six children 
who live in Krum, Texas. 
Captain Owen devoted over 20 years of his 
life to protect and serve his community, putting 
strangers’ safety above his own, and we are 
indebted to him. His positive impact and 
worthwhile contributions to the UNT Police De-
partment and UNT community will be sorely 
missed. I am deeply grateful for his service 
and pray for comfort and peace for his wife, 
children and friends.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
TYSONS 
RE-
GIONAL 
CHAMBER 
OF 
COM-
MERCE AND THE INCOMING 2020 
BOARD MEMBERS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Tysons Regional Chamber of 
Commerce and to congratulate the incoming 
2020 board members. 
Tysons has drastically transformed during 
the past 56 years from a sleepy, rural area to 
one of the most vibrant regions in the country. 
This change began when the Fairfax County 
Board of Supervisors approved plans for the 
Tysons Corner Shopping Center in 1962. 
When the mall opened in 1968, it was hailed 
as the largest enclosed mall in the world. 
Since then, there has been a dramatic influx 
of technology companies, government con-
tracting firms, and other corporations. Tysons 
has become the premier business district of 
the Washington Metropolitan Area and is one 
of the largest employment centers in the 
United States. With the opening of Metro’s Sil-
ver Line and ongoing redevelopment, the re-
gion is expected to continue adding not only 
businesses but also high-density residential 
housing. 45 million square feet of transit-ori-
ented development is already present in 
Tysons and more is on the way. 
The mission of the Tysons Regional Cham-
ber of Commerce is to be the unified voice of 
the business community while ensuring that its 
ties and commitment to the community are 
strengthened. 
The Chamber actively promotes local non- 
profits and community organizations as well as 
youth educational programs, and it sponsors 
multiple events each year in support of these 
activities. The growth of the Chamber has 
been the result of the diversity of its members 
and the leadership of its Board. I am pleased 
to include in the RECORD the following names 
of the incoming 2020 board members: 
Chairman of the Board: Tucker Gladhill. 
At-Large Members: Adelle Elia, Alex Levy, An-
drew Clark, Angela Inzerillo, Anthony Anikeeff, 
Brenda MacRoberts, Courtney Pierce, Diana 
Villarreal, Dr. Michelle Walker, Gina Westfall, 
Jeff Brouse, Kara Shelton, Kathy McNeill, Ken 
Fischer, Kevin Corey, Kevin Schafer, Maureen 
Caufield, Maurice Springer, Miriam Tadross, 
Micah Edmond, Mike Batt, Peter Fish, Richard 
Luttrell, Timothy Klinkner, Tracy Harris, Vicki 
Warker. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating the incoming board 
members and in commending the Tysons Re-
gional Chamber of Commerce for its commit-
ment to promoting the business community 
while encouraging social responsibility and 
civic engagement. I wish the Chamber the 
very best for its continued growth and suc-
cess.

IN HONOR OF TORRINGTON VOL-
UNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT’S 100 
YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Torrington Volunteer Fire 
Department on celebrating 100 years of dedi-
cated service to Torrington and the sur-
rounding community. 
When it was formed on February 14, 1920, 
the department consisted of a horse-drawn 
cart and a fire bell. In the years that followed, 
the department received modern engines like 
the 1934 Ford engine that has been fully re-
stored and is on display at the firehouse 
today. Volunteer fire companies play a critical 
role in keeping our communities safe, and I 
extend my thanks to all the volunteers—past 
and present—who have dedicated their time to 
Torrington. Today represents a milestone in 
the storied history of the department, and I 
know they will continue to serve their commu-
nity with distinction for the next 100 years as 
well. 
Again, Madam Speaker, I extend my con-
gratulations to the Torrington Volunteer Fire 
Department for 100 years of service.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
VILLAGE 
OF WILLIAMSFIELD FOR RECEIV-
ING THE 2019 GOVERNOR’S HOME-
TOWN AWARD CUP 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the village of Williamsfield, Illinois 
for receiving the 2019 Governor’s Hometown 
Award Cup for the Playground Barn Raising 
Project. The Williamsfield Park District and 
Williamsfield Future Farmers of America Alum-
ni and Friends worked together to make this 
project possible. 
The Governor’s Hometown Award Cup has 
been bestowed every year since 1983 to rec-
ognize those who have contributed to projects 
that improve quality of life in the community. 
When the playground in Williamsfield village 
park started deteriorating, $150,000 were 
raised to build a multi-level playground barn 
with several other play features. Seventy- 
seven volunteers were recruited and gave 
2,032 hours to build these structures. The 
award committee noted that the ‘‘inspirational 
barn raising promotes physical activity among 
youth and embodies the power of vol-
unteerism.’’ This marks the first time the 
award has gone to anyone in Knox County, Il-
linois. Williamsfield will keep the trophy for a 
year and the Illinois Department of Transpor-
tation will set up a road sign in the community 
for the award. I commend Williamsfield for 
their dedication to the community. 
It is because of the community leaders, vol-
unteers and everyone who made the Play-
ground Barn Raising Project possible in 
Williamsfield that I am especially proud to 
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
congratulate the village of Williamsfield for 
winning 
the 
2019 
Governor’s 
Hometown 
Award Cup.

Friday, February 14, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Ms. Helen Sekutowski, a resident of 
Westland, Michigan, as she celebrates her 
ninetieth birthday. 
Ms. Sekutowski was born in Detroit on Feb-

a positive and spiritual life, attending mass 
services every Sunday. Her light and love for 
life is demonstrated through the positive spirit 
and impact that she has on her friends and 
neighbors. 
Please

Helen 
Sekutowski’s ninetieth birthday as we wish her 
many more to come.

Born on February 4, 1932, Clifford grew up 
in Bayonne, New Jersey, and graduated with 
a degree in Political Science from the Univer-
sity of Maryland. In 1952, Clifford enlisted in 
the Air Force and was a B–29 Superfortress 
crew member during the Korean War. He later 
served as a military advisor in Vietnam and 
was a pilot, navigator, bombardier, and missile 
combat crew commander. His military decora-
tions include The Legion of Merit, the Bronze 
Star, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air 
Medal, and the Commendation Medal. In 
1957, he married the love of his life, Jean 
Marie Nissen. Clifford completed postings 
across the country, before he finally settled in 
California in 1973 with Jean Marie and their 
three sons. 
Once Clifford retired from active duty in 
1978, he quickly established himself as an ac-
tive member of his community. He served 21 
years as a Firefighter, Assistant Fire Chief and 
Emergency Medical Technician in the Gordon 
Valley Volunteer Fire Department. The com-
munity recognized his leadership by electing 
him President of the Napa Sunrise Rotary 
Club, board member of the Napa-Solano 
United Way, the North Bay YMCA, the 
Silverado Council of the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica, and the Napa Chamber of Commerce. He 
continued his passion for flying and was often 
found at the Nut Tree Airport, teaching flying 
or surrounded by friends who shared his love 
for aviation. The Federal Aviation Administra-
tion honored him with the highly prestigious 
Wright Brothers ‘‘Master Pilot Award,’’ recog-
nizing over 50 years of Clifford’s aviation ex-
pertise. For fun, Clifford would travel to Car-
mel and Hawaii with his family and was a win-
ery tour guide at Charles Krug and Monticello 
Wineries. 
He is survived by his wife Jean Marie; chil-
dren Clifford Anthony, Paul William, and Roger 
Alan; and grandchildren Clifford, Jon, Megan, 
Kelsey, Patrick, Gabriel, and Joseph. l know 
that they, along with the rest of his extended 
family and friends, join me in celebrating his

EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to voice my support for the Equal Rights 
Amendment. 
For 20 years in the North Carolina General 
Assembly, I fought tirelessly to get our state to 
ratify the ERA. 
And, since joining this body in 2014, I have 
supported the ERA in every Congress. 
That’s why I was overjoyed to see Virginia’s 
vote last month to become the 38th and final 
state needed to ratify the ERA. 
For 100 years women in North Carolina, Vir-
ginia, and all across this country have been 
fighting for the ERA. 
And we shouldn’t have to wait another 100 
years to get equal justice under the law. 
To this day, women are still paid less for our 
work, face workplace harassment, and are dis-
criminated against simply for being who they 
are. 
Women who work full time, year-round still 
only make 82 cents on the dollar for men’s 
earnings. 
For women of color, the disparity is even 
worse. 
Black women make only 62 cents, Latinas 
make 54 cents, and Native women make 58 
cents for every dollar paid to white, non-His-
panic men. 
One in three women experience sexual vio-
lence in their lifetime. 
Sixty to seventy percent of women face sex-
ual harassment during their careers. 
Sixty-two percent of pregnant women and 
new moms are in the workforce, yet under 
current law, pregnant workers can be placed 
on unpaid leave or forced out of their jobs be-
cause of a pregnancy. 
These are just some of the reasons that 
ratifying the ERA is so important. 
The ERA would help us fight those battles 
by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of 
sex in our most important, foundational docu-
ment: the Constitution. 
I think we can all agree that our courts 
shouldn’t have the option to treat women as 
less than equal. 
The Constitution was designed to be 
amended. 
Our founders made mistakes. They counted 
me as three-fifths of a person. They allowed 
slavery to persist in our country. They weren’t 
Gods; they were men. 
And, as times change, we have a responsi-
bility to change with them to ensure ALL peo-
ple are afforded equal protections and rights. 
To quote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, ‘‘I 
ask no favor for my sex; all I ask of our breth-
ren is that they take their feet off our necks.’’ 
That’s why we won’t rest until women and 
men are finally equal under the eyes of the 
law.

RECOGNIZING 
MR. 
SYED 
BABAR 
ALI ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 
94TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize an individual who has made enor-
mous contributions to our global community, 
Mr. Syed Babar Ali, who will be celebrating his 
94th birthday this year. In celebration of this 
occasion, it is only fitting that I and my col-
leagues take a moment to reflect and recog-
nize some of the contributions he has made 
throughout his life. 
Mr. Ali was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1926 
to prominent businessman Syed Maratib Ali 
and his wife Syeda Mubarik Begum, who was 
descended from the Afghan royal family. Mr. 
Ali learned the secrets of creating and man-
aging successful businesses at the side of his 
father whose company was one of the largest 
contractors to the British Army during the colo-
nial occupation of Pakistan, then still part of 
India. Mr. Ali began his education at Aitchison 
College in Lahore but soon relocated to the 
United States to continue his education at the 
University of Michigan. He had not been there 
long when the partition of India occurred and 
the newly independent nation of Pakistan was 
formed. Looking to use his skills to help his 
homeland, he returned to Pakistan in 1947, 
completing his education at the University of 
Punjab. 
As a visionary and entrepreneur, Mr. Ali 
began his business career shortly after grad-
uation, joining his family in a cotton exporting 
business. As he strove to increase exports, he 
recognized a need for a packaging company 
and founded Packages Unlimited which be-
came Pakistan’s largest paper and board mill. 
He was also the founder of Milkpak Limited, 
now Nestle Pakistan Limited, which grew to 
become the largest food processing company 
in Pakistan. An advocate of joint ventures, he 
created partnerships with well-known foreign 
and international companies including Coca- 
Cola, 
Nestle, 
Tetra 
Pak 
(Sweden) 
and 
Mitsubishi, among others. After Zulfikar Ali 
Bhutto was elected President of Pakistan, the 
country began nationalizing many industries 
causing Mr. Ali’s family to lose five of their six 
large businesses including their automotive 
and insurance businesses. Mr. Ali later re-
flected that these experiences helped teach 
him how to build and run a business from the 
ground up. 
During this time, Mr. Ali began to realize 
that Pakistan needed a school of management 
to train managers and entrepreneurs, not only 
to benefit the individual students but to ensure 
the future prosperity of the entire country. 
While studying at Harvard Business School, 
he sought the advice of faculty to guide him 
on how the school he wanted to establish 
should be set up. His driving force was to cre-
ate an educational system capable of pro-
ducing economic managers and creative think-
ers—two things which were greatly needed in 
the country that at the time, was then experi-
encing economic growth and political up-
heaval. 
Supported by a $10 million grant from 
USAID and the patronage of the Pakistani 
business-industrial community, Mr. Ali founded 
Lahore 
University 
of 
Management 
and 
Science, now known by its acronym LUMS. 
From its beginning as a business school, 
LUMS has expanded its programs which now 
include liberal arts, science and engineering, 
economics, computer sciences, education and 
law. 
In 2011, LUMS launched the National Out-
reach Programme to reach bright students 
from underprivileged areas of Pakistan. Under 
this initiative, selected candidates are brought 
into academic programs to prepare them for 
acceptance to the university. LUMS provides 
full financial assistance to those who enter this 
program. Financial assistance for other stu-
dents include generous scholarships and inter-
est-free loans. 
Mr. Ali has also contributed to the better-
ment of Pakistan and the world in ways be-
yond business and education. In 1993, he 
served as Minister of Finance, Economic Af-
fairs and Planning for Pakistan’s caretaker 
government and has served the World Wildlife 
Fund International in various capacities includ-
ing President. In 1985 he established the 
Babar Ali Foundation that contributes approxi-
mately $1 million each year primarily to edu-
cation and health initiatives in Pakistan. In rec-
ognition of his efforts and countless contribu-
tions, he has received honors and awards 
from the governments of Sweden and the 
Netherlands, an Order of the British Empire 
Award (OBE), and an honorary Doctorate De-

HONORING LANA MCCANTS AS A 
VETERAN AND AS A PART OF 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Lana McCants for her achieve-
ments in the United States Navy for Black His-
tory Month. Ms. McCants served from May of 
1991 to January of 1997 and earned the rank 
of Operations Specialist Third Class. 
Operations Specialist Third Class McCants 
trained at the Orlando Naval Training Station 
and the Virginia Beach Naval Technical Train-
ing Facility. She was part of the crew of the 
USS Acadia, the Point Loma Naval Submarine 
Station, the USS David R. Ray, and Operation 
Desert Storm. I commend her for her service 
and honor her as a part of the Black History 
Month Program in Rockford called ‘‘Capturing 
American History: The Unique Perspective of 
the African-American Female Service Mem-
ber.’’ I would like to thank Lana McCants for 
her service and recognize her for her experi-
ences as an African American female service-
member. She has shown true commitment, 
leadership and determination throughout her 
time in the Navy. 
It is because of community leaders like 
Lana that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally honor 
Lana McCants for her service in the United 
States Navy.

Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I regrettably 
missed Roll Call Vote 37 on February 5, 2020.

I would have voted YEA on Roll Call 37.

HONORING ABDULLAH EL-AMIN 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate Imam Abdullah El-Amin’s commit-
ment to community service. 
Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, Abdullah El- 
Amin moved to Detroit, Michigan at the age of 
7. His interest in the sciences led him to Shaw 
College, where he earned a Bachelor of 
Science degree in Biology and Chemistry and 
worked for twenty years as a medical tech-
nologist at various laboratories. 
Abdullah El-Amin was called to pursue a 
more spiritual path. In 1983, Imam Abdullah, 
along with other members of the community, 
founded the Muslim Center of Detroit. It was 
incorporated in 1985. The mosque was formed 
primarily as a place for worship and as an out-
reach center to bring people from different reli-
gious backgrounds together. Imam Abdullah 
has always been passionate in his belief that 
interfaith dialogue creates stronger and more 
meaningful relationships across cultures. 
Imam El-Amin is known for his ability to cre-
ate connections across communities, and he 
has served as a delegate for projects inter-
nationally. Imam El-Amin also co-founded and 
served as the Executive Director of the Michi-
gan Muslim Community Council (formerly, the 
Council of Islamic Organizations of Michigan). 
His work there allowed him to forge many re-
lationships and friendships with the broader 
Muslim community. In addition, he founded 
Crescent Janazah Services after seeing the 
need for quality end-of-life-care in the Metro- 
Detroit area, where he fostered the assistance 
of hundreds, if not thousands of families in 
their time of need. In addition to his spiritual 
and charitable work, Imam El-Amin is pas-
sionate about civic engagement. He served 
former mayor Dennis Archer as manager of 
the Neighborhood City Hall. 
Imam El-Amin is foremost a family man. He 
was married to the love of his life, Dr. Cheryl 
El-Amin who he misses terribly. They are the 
parents of three children, Maurice, a high 
school principal; Zarinah, anthropologist and 
cultural entrepreneur; and Idris, Doctor of Vet-
erinary Medicine. 
Please join me in saluting Imam El-Amin, as 
we recognize his many contributions to the 
spiritual and civic life of Detroit.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
CHILDREN’S MUSEUM ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the National Children’s Mu-
seum Act, which would require the Adminis-
trator of the General Services Administration 
(GSA) to enter into a cooperative agreement 
with the National Children’s Museum (NCM) to 
allow NCM to remain in the Ronald Reagan 
Building and International Trade Center, a fed-
erally owned building, without charge. My bill 
would allow the newly redesigned NCM, the 
nation’s first combination children’s museum 
and science center, to remain centrally located 
in the nation’s capital for the benefit of all. 
Originally named the Capital Children’s Mu-
seum, NCM was a staple in the District of Co-
lumbia for decades. The institution opened in 
1974 in a former convent on H Street North-
east. In 2003, Congress recognized the im-
mense value in having a children’s museum in 
the District and officially designated the mu-
seum the National Children’s Museum. By 
2004, NCM had outgrown its home on H 
Street, but had difficulty securing a new loca-
tion. Since 2015 NCM’s presence has been 
digital, serving D.C. public school students 
and public libraries online. 
Now located in its new home in the Ronald 
Reagan Building at 1300 Pennsylvania Ave-
nue NW, NCM is poised to bring new and in-
novative STEAM (science, technology, engi-
neering, arts, math) exhibits to the nation’s 
capital, building on more than 30 years of edu-
cating D.C. children and families. 
Despite its many benefits it brings to the na-
tion’s capital, NCM remains an outlier in terms 
of upkeep and maintenance. NCM is the only 
congressionally designated museum expected 
to pay rent in a federal building. This bill would 
allow NCM to remain in its current federal lo-
cation without payment of rent, allowing staff 
to focus on bringing 21st century STEAM 
learning techniques to the nation’s capital. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF LOIS 
WARREN 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of the memory of Lois Warren, a Detroit 
native, for her legacy of tenacity and spirit. 
Ms. Warren valued hard work and it was 
evident in her everyday life. She earned a 
Bachelor’s Degree in English and Social Work, 
a Master’s Degree in Psychology and Social 
Work, and was among the first African-Amer-
ican women to earn a Juris Doctorate from the 
University of Detroit Mercy. Ms. Warren en-
joyed a wide-ranging career that included 
leadership roles as head of the Psychiatric So-
cial Work Department of the former Herman 
Keifer Hospital in Detroit, and Executive Direc-
tor of the Intake Division of the Michigan De-
partment of Civil Rights. 
More importantly, Ms. Warren was an advo-
cate for civil rights and the visually impaired. 
Ms. Warren’s own daughter, who lives with 
visual impairment, was the inspiration behind 
her relentless advocacy. She also played a 
key role in the wider distribution of large-print 
materials, such as menus, and for improved 
visual markers on large glass doors. Further-
more, she fought against women’s wage in-
equities in her daily work, calling out unfair 
pay for work performed. 
Please join me in recognizing the out-
standing contributions of Lois Warren, a truly 
exemplary person.

RECOGNIZING BRAD GORDON ON 
THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIRE-
MENT 
FROM 
THE 
AMERICAN 
ISRAEL PUBLIC AFFAIRS COM-
MITTEE 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize my dear and longtime friend Brad 
Gordon on the occasion of his retirement, con-
cluding a career of dedicated public service 
and advocacy spanning more than 40 years. 
Brad Gordon has personified excellence 
throughout his career. He graduated cum 
laude and with Honors in Politics from Bran-
deis University in 1971. He went on to earn a 
Master of Arts in Political Science from the 
University of Vermont, a Master of Philosophy 
from Columbia University, and a Certificate 
from their Middle East Institute. While at Co-
lumbia, Brad was a National Defense Foreign 
Language Fellow in Arabic, while also serving 
as a Research Assistant. By 1979 he had 
begun his career in public service, working for 
the Central Intelligence Agency as a Political 
Analyst in the Office of Near Eastern and 
South Asian Analysis. 
Brad spent 6 years at the CIA before he 
transitioned to a legislative role as both a for-
eign policy advisor for Senator Rudy Bosch-
witz (R–MN), and as a professional staff mem-
ber of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, where I had the privilege of also serv-
ing. 
Based on his wealth of foreign policy knowl-
edge and experience, Brad was appointed the 
Assistant Director of the U.S. Arms Control 
and Disarmament Agency for Nonproliferation 
Policy. During his tenure, he served as the 
U.S. Ambassador to the Fourth Review Con-
ference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons in Geneva. He was re-
sponsible for issues related to the proliferation 
of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. 
In 1993, Brad became the Staff Director of 
the International Operations Subcommittee of 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where 
he helped oversee the operations of the State 
Department, the Agency for International De-
velopment, the Arms Control and Disar-
mament Agency, and the U.S. Information 
Agency. 
In 1995, Brad started working on constituent 
and issue advocacy as the Legislative Director 
of the American Israel Public Affairs Com-
mittee (AIPAC). He went on to serve as the 
Director of Policy and Government Affairs and 
eventually as the Director for Strategic Policy 
at AIPAC. Throughout his career, Brad was an 
asset to all those around him. His intelligence, 
veracity, unflagging work ethic, persistence, 
and quality of character are unquestionable.’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating my friend, Brad Gordon 
on his retirement and in wishing him all the 
best in his future endeavors. 
HONORING MILANA HERMAN AS A 
VETERAN AND AS A PART OF 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 14, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Milana Herman for her achieve-
ments in the United States Army for Black His-
tory Month. Ms. Herman served in the Active 
Army from 1989 to 1994 and the Army Re-
serve from 1994 to 1997 and earned the rank

gade Battalion in Ft. Bragg, North Carolina 
during her time in the Active Army. She

Division in the Army Reserves. I commend her 
for her service and honor her as a part of the

Unique Perspective of the African American 
Female Service Member.’’ I would like to 
thank Milana Herman for her service and rec-
ognize her for her experiences as an African 
American female servicemember. Her bravery, 
strength and patriotism are admirable. 
It is because of community leaders like 
Milana that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally honor 
Milana Herman for her service in the United 
States Army.
