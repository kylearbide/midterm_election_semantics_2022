Inspire the men and women of Con-
gress 
during 
this

forts, help to lift those Americans who 
struggle most in these days. 
May each American rise to our 
shared effort to remind ourselves that 
we are all responsible for the greatness 
of our Nation, and to make the sac-
rifices necessary to emerge better in 
virtue and stronger in national well- 
being. With Your grace, O Lord, may it 
be so. 
May everything done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

HOUSE 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam

the gentleman from Wisconsin, the 
Honorable Thomas P. Tiffany, be per-
mitted to take the oath of office today. 
His certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest and no

follows: 
Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you 
will support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, for-

f 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
MIKE GARCIA TO THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SHERMAN) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, by 
tradition, the dean of the respective 
State delegation introduces new Mem-
bers from their State at a swearing in 
after a special election. Our dean, the 
dean of the California delegation, is 
also the Speaker of the House. And 
while I have seen her do amazing 
things, I have never seen her be in two 
places at the same time. 
So I have the distinct honor of filling 
in for her here as dean, and the pleas-
ure of introducing MIKE GARCIA, the 
new Member from the 25th Congres-
sional District. The election has, as I 
noted before, not been certified by the 
Secretary of State, but there is no dis-
pute about the result. 
Congressman GARCIA
was born in 
1976, and is a native of Santa Clarita, 
California, and is a first generation 
American citizen. Congressman GARCIA 
moved to Saugus, which is now part of 
the city of Santa Clarita, in 1982 with 
his mother and stepfather at the age of 
six. 
Mr. GARCIA received his bachelor’s 
degree in political science from the 
U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis in 
1998. He was nominated to that acad-
emy and to the Navy by our long-time 
colleague, the former chair of the 
House Armed Services Committee, our 
friend, Buck McKeon. 
He later earned a master of arts in 
national security policy from George-
town University. He is a former U.S. 
naval officer and flew as a pilot in the 
Navy from 1998 until 2009. After the 
Navy, Congressman GARCIA worked in 
the aerospace industry, and now owns 
his own real estate business. MIKE is 
the husband of Rebecca Garcia and the 
father of Preston, age 13, and Jett, age 
3. 
I represent the district that lies im-
mediately to the south of MIKE GARCIA, 
and the gentleman who represents the 
district immediately to the north is 
the distinguished minority leader, who 
I know has additional words to say 
about our new colleague. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCAR-
THY). 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, in 
the last 230 years, dating back to the 
founding of our Republic, fewer than 
11,000 Americans have had the privilege 
to stand here as a Member of Congress. 
Today it is my honor to welcome one 
of the newest, MIKE GARCIA. As a vet-
eran, a businessman, a family man, and 
a first-generation American, MIKE has 
shown a driven-approach to everything 
he has taken. 
If you ever want a definition of 
America, look to MIKE’s life. First gen-
eration, many like our fathers, moth-
ers, grandparents, wanted something 
better for their children so they came 
to America. MIKE dreamed, at age six, 
that one day maybe he could become a 
Navy fighter pilot. He knew it would 
not be easy, so he strived, applied him-
self, and was nominated to the Naval 
Academy from this body itself. 
Not only did he excel, he graduated 
in the top 3 percent, becoming a fighter 
pilot, something many of us always 
look to the skies to dream and wonder 
what it takes to become one. As he be-
came a fighter pilot, his Nation called 
upon him to defend our freedoms, those 
that we uphold, that he just raised his 
hand to defend the Constitution a few 
short moments ago. He excelled at that 
because he believes in service. 
After his service into the Navy he 
worked as a businessman. He has a 
beautiful family, Rebecca, sons Pres-
ton, who is with us on the floor, and his 
son Jett, up with his wife Rebecca, and 
his brother, and sister-in-law. 
George Washington once said: ‘‘Re-
member that it is the actions and not 
the commission that makes an officer, 
and that there is more expected from 
him than the title.’’ Washington was 
speaking about being a military offi-
cer. But his advice perfectly describes 
what it means to be a Member of Con-
gress. We are a small group with a big 
responsibility, to represent the voice of 
the people in Washington. Ultimately, 
it is our actions, not our titles, that 
matter. 
MIKE’s feat today is not something 
people just assumed. Yes, you have to 
run. Yes, you have to unite people. But 
he did something that people on my 
side of the aisle have not done in more 
than 22 years. He did it in a manner 
where an election was bigger than most 
people had thought, and they had to 
run these races in a time of a crisis in 
America that they held the elections to 
be different. 
He changed the course in a few short 
times. If there is one person that I be-
lieve can unite this body, unite this 
Nation, it is a man whose life actually 
defines America. Family comes here, 
the dreams of a life better for their 
children. 
He strives and excels in public edu-
cation to get nominated by the United 
States House of Representatives and 
his own congressman to go to the 
Naval Academy. He excels at the acad-
emy to become a jet fighter pilot and 
defends our Nation in a time of need. 
And one more time his Nation called 
upon him to serve, he rose to the occa-
sion, and unbelievable obstacles that 
many did not believe he could achieve 
by uniting a district to help unite a 
Nation and help unite Congress itself. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
MIKE, and I look forward to what he is 
able to achieve in this body, much that 
he has been able to achieve before he 
came here. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. GARCIA), our newest Member. 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
California and Leader MCCARTHY for 
that very gracious introduction. I want 
to thank you all for being here today. 
First and foremost, I want to thank my 
beautiful bride and wife, Rebecca, and 
our two beautiful boys, Preston and 
Jett, for being the backbone of my sur-
vival, and the spirit of this campaign 
for over a year now. So thank you very 
much. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to thank 
the 715,000 people in California’s beau-
tiful 25th Congressional District that 
helped me get here, and it is a huge 
honor that has been bestowed upon me 
to represent you in this body, I do it 
with humility and with, hopefully, per-
formance that represents all of us in 
the 25th District. 
I can think of no better way to serve 
this country, to serve our district, than

to be here today taking this oath and 
doing the job before me over the course 
of the next several years. 
For 244 years, this beautiful Nation 
has thrived and survived on the back of 
those who showed up at the right time 
to do the right thing, and for the right 
reasons. 
I, as an American, someone who is a 
first-generation American who served 
my country, I show up today, not only 
as a patriot, but now a citizen legis-
lator, to make sure that we do what is 
right for our country first, to make 
sure that we do what is right for my 
district that I represent, and to, hope-
fully, get through this crisis as a solid, 
unified country, becoming stronger as 
we do so, more cooperative in the ef-
forts and, hopefully, making this Na-
tion the strongest the world has ever 
seen for several decades, millenniums 
to come. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate all the 
support. Thank you for being here, and 
may God bless the United States of 
America.

WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
THOMAS 
P. 
TIFFANY 
TO 
THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER) is recognized for 1 
minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, one of the few things that 
deans do around here, aside from using 
our institutional memory, is to ask 
unanimous consent that people who are 
elected in special elections from their 
State be permitted to take the oath of 
office. 
Today it is my great honor and, in-
deed, a privilege, to ask that TOM TIF-
FANY be able to take the oath of office, 
and to join the list of fewer than 11,000 
people that have been honored by their 
constituents to serve in this House. 
TOM spent a lot of his life being a 
successful small businessman. He was 
elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 
2008, and 2 years later was elected to 
the first of two terms in the Wisconsin 
Senate. He has been a very strong and 
vocal proponent of the interests of peo-
ple in northern and western Wisconsin, 
and he will continue to do so on the na-
tional stage. 
Madam Speaker, it is now my honor 
to yield to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank Leader MCCARTHY 
and the Members of the Wisconsin dele-
gation in attendance here today. And I 
would like to thank Congressman SEN-
SENBRENNER for his kind introduction; 
I wish him the best as he concludes his 
years servicing the people of Wisconsin 
in the Halls of Congress. Thank you, 
Speaker PELOSI, for taking time out of 
your busy day to conduct this swearing 
in. 
My message is simple. Ten years ago 
I was given the great privilege to rep-
resent the people of northern Wis-
consin in the State legislature in Madi-
son. I made one commitment to them, 
to advance the cause of freedom and 
liberty. 
Today, I make that same commit-
ment to the good people of northern 
and western Wisconsin, to fight for 
those same enduring ideals that form 
the foundation of the American Repub-
lican. 
Madam Speaker, I wish to thank my 
mother, Virgal Tiffany who, along with 
my deceased father, Pat Tiffany, raised 
my seven brothers and sisters in the 
little town of Elmwood, Wisconsin, 
with love and devotion. I am here 
today, Mom, because of the persistence 
and determination you have lived your 
life by every day. Madam Speaker, I 
suspect that she is down in her kitchen 
right now canning sauerkraut and 
pickles just like she has always done as 
a farm girl. Yes. 
And, finally, to my wife, Chris, and 
our three daughters, Karlyn, Lexie, and 
Katherine, they are up in the gallery 
there. I hope you are as excited as I am 
as we turn the pages to a new chapter 
in our lives. Thank you for standing 
with me all of these years.

S2481 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MAY 19, 2020 
No. 94 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
God 
of 
our 
destiny, 
You 
have 
watched over us from generation to 
generation. May our lawmakers trust 
Your faithfulness during this chal-
lenging season of our Nation’s history. 
Lord, inspire them to recall how You 
have sustained this land we love in 
prosperity and adversity, in peace and 
in war. Give our Senators the wisdom 
to believe that they can trust Your 
constancy and greatness as they cling 
to Your promise to never leave or for-
sake them. Believing in Your power, 
help us all to face fresh challenges with 
total confidence in You. 
And, Lord, we pray for the health and 
safety of all as communities begin the 
process of reopening businesses. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 
minutes as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CHINA AND THE WORLD HEALTH 
ORGANIZATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
am deeply concerned about reports 
that China began hoarding medical 
supplies in early January while work-
ing to prevent the World Health Orga-
nization from sounding the alarm 
about the virus pandemic. 
By 
analyzing 
international 
trade 
data, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity assessed that the Chinese Gov-
ernment intentionally concealed the 
severity of COVID–19 from the world in 
early January in order to stockpile 
medical supplies. Furthermore, the 
Chinese Communist Party Government 
tried to hide its actions by denying 
there were any export restrictions. 
They even tried to obscure and delay 
its trade data so it wouldn’t get 
caught. 
These acts are outrageous. 
Even worse, the CIA and foreign in-
telligence agencies have found evidence 
that 
China 
threatened 
the 
World 
Health Organization to stop cooper-
ating on efforts to combat COVID–19 if 
the organization declared a global 
health emergency early on. So it was 
declared, and, hence, there was valu-
able time lost in fighting the virus. 
This is simply unacceptable behavior. 
The Chinese Communist Party ought 
to be held accountable for the count-
less lives that have been lost around 
the globe due to its nontransparent, 
aggressive, inhumane behavior. 
The World Health Organization is 
composed of many honorable and dedi-
cated medical professionals who be-
lieve in the WHO’s mission. If any of 
them were privy to what was going on 
by the Chinese Communist Party, he 
ought to step forward and shine light 
on any misdeeds by the organization’s 
leadership. 
Whistleblowers are necessary to pre-
vent corruption within any institution, 
which is why I have a longstanding rep-
utation of protecting whistleblowers. 
The world deserves to know what the 
World Health Organization’s leaders 
knew and when they knew it. The evi-
dence is quickly becoming crystal 
clear—that China is responsible for tre-
mendous suffering worldwide through 
its lies and active coverup. Telling the 
truth about the Chinese Communist 
Party does not, as some have sug-
gested, have any bearing on how we 
analyze our domestic response. 
We should learn from democratic 
countries that have been successful in 
containing outbreaks, like Taiwan and 
South Korea. However, in going for-
ward, 
everyone 
around 
the 
world 
should have his eyes open about the 
true nature of the Chinese regime. 
I yield the floor.

GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the coronavirus pandemic continues to 
challenge our Nation, and the Senate is 
here working for the American people. 
Our committees have called in ex-
perts like Dr. Fauci and leaders like 
Chairman Powell to discuss the CARES 
Act and the path toward reopening. We 
are tracking the effects of the largest 
rescue package ever and are consid-
ering next steps, like strong legal pro-
tections so that doctors, small busi-
nesses, schoolteachers, and universities 
do not face a second epidemic of frivo-
lous lawsuits. 
The Senate is also staying on top of 
other threats that predated COVID–19— 
the meddling of Putin’s Russia, the 
brutal 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party, 
rogue states like Iran and North Korea, 
foreign terrorists such as ISIS. 
Two weeks ago, we overwhelmingly 
confirmed an impressive leader for the 
National Counterintelligence and Secu-
rity Center, whom Acting DNI Grenell 
has announced will play a central role 
in briefing candidates and campaigns 
on foreign threats against our elec-
tions.

ligence Committee, now led by Acting

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2482 
May 19, 2020 
Chairman RUBIO, will report out the 
President’s nominee to be the next Di-
rector of National Intelligence, and, 
last week, we reauthorized essential 
tools that our intelligence community 
needs to defend our homeland, track 
our enemies, and protect Americans. 
But we didn’t stop there. 
Over the last several years, we have 
been painfully reminded that our Na-
tion and our liberties are not only 
threatened from without. The fabric of 
our country is also hurt when tools and 
capabilities that are meant to keep us 
safe are abused in ways that are, at 
best, reckless, sloppy, and unaccount-
able—or, worse, polluted by political 
bias. 
In 2016, the FBI embarked on a coun-
terintelligence investigation against 
Donald Trump’s campaign for the Pres-
idency. Federal law enforcement used 
taxpayer money to scrutinize a polit-
ical campaign in the middle of a demo-
cratic 
election. 
You 
would 
have 
thought such a radical step must have 
sprung from an air-tight justification. 
Certainly, you would think the out-
going Obama administration should 
only have used the awesome power of 
the Federal Government to pry into 
their political rivals if they had had a 
slam-dunk basis for doing so, but that 
is not what they had. 
In one instance, the FBI got permis-
sion to surveil a Trump associate by 
telling half-truths, blurring evidence, 
and citing sketchy sources like a dos-
sier of partisan opposition research 
that had been funded by the Hillary 
Clinton campaign and the DNC. 
Here is how even the New York 
Times explained the recent findings of 
the Justice Department’s inspector 
general: ‘‘The FBI had cherry-picked 
and 
misstated 
evidence 
about 
the 
Trump adviser . . . when seeking per-
mission to wiretap him.’’ 
That was from the New York Times. 
So an American citizen’s campaign 
for the American Presidency was treat-
ed like a hostile foreign power by our 
own law enforcement, in part, because 
the Democratic-led executive branch 
manipulated documents, hid contrary 
evidence, and made a DNC-funded dos-
sier a launch pad for an investigation. 
The inspector general counted seven 
significant inaccuracies and omissions. 
Here is his report: 
We identified multiple instances in which 
factual assertions relied upon in the [FBI’s] 
FISA application were inaccurate, incom-
plete, or unsupported by appropriate docu-
mentation based upon information the FBI 
had in its possession at the time the applica-
tion was filed. 
Did you catch that last part? It was 
based upon information the FBI had in 
its possession at the time the applica-
tion was filed. So we are either talking 
about gross incompetence or inten-
tional bias. Does any Senator think it 
is acceptable for any Federal warrant 
application to include seven significant 
inaccuracies and omissions? But this 
wasn’t just a run-of-the-mill warrant; 
it was a FISA warrant to snoop on a 
Presidential campaign. 
This is just one of the realities that 
President Trump’s Democratic critics 
spent years calling conspiracy theories 
or inventions of the President’s mind. 
Yet here it is in black and white from 
exactly the kind of independent inspec-
tor general the Democrats rushed to 
embrace when convenient. 
Sadly, this was no isolated incident. 
Just recently, Attorney General Barr 
has had to take the incredible step of 
unwinding the DOJ prosecution of an-
other former Trump adviser because 
the government’s case against him was 
unfair and distorted as well. 
It was largely on the basis of these 
proceedings that the Democrats and 
the media spent years being fixated on 
wild theories of Russian collusion, but 
upon investigation, the Mueller inves-
tigation—remember that one?—it is 
those wild allegations that collapsed 
along with the credibility of several of 
these investigations that helped to cre-
ate the cloud of suspicion in the first 
place. 
In the words of our distinguished At-
torney General: 
The proper investigative and prosecutorial 
standards of the Department of Justice were 
abused. . . . We saw two different standards 
of justice emerge, one that applied to Presi-
dent Trump and his associates and the other 
that applied to everybody else. We can’t 
allow this ever to happen again. 
That is from the Attorney General. 
Oh, and by the way, as if this debacle 
needed even more shocking behavior, I 
understand a Federal judge may try to 
continue prosecuting one of these cases 
even though the prosecution itself 
wants to drop it. The judge has taken 
it upon himself to go browsing for 
other hostile parties. Obviously, that 
subverts our constitutional order in 
which the executive alone decides 
whether to prosecute cases. 
So, look, no matter what some Wash-
ington Democrats may try to claim, 
you are not crazy or a conspiracy theo-
rist if you see a pattern of institutional 
unfairness toward this President. You 
would have to be blind not to see one. 
All of this is why the Senate passed 
important FISA reforms in last week’s 
bill—to help bring accountability and 
transparency into that flawed proc-
ess—and we aren’t nearly finished. 
As soon as possible, the full Senate 
will vote on Mr. RATCLIFFE’s nomina-
tion. The President will have a Senate- 
confirmed DNI who can pursue the 
vital national security work of our 
tireless intelligence community while 
he can also ensure that the IC stays 
out of politics and out of the papers. 
Just yesterday, Chairman GRAHAM 
announced the Committee on the Judi-
ciary will vote on a serious new set of 
subpoenas so the Senate can hear di-
rectly from key players like James 
Comey, 
Andrew 
McCabe, 
Loretta 
Lynch, and many others to continue 
getting to the bottom of this. Let me 
say that again. The Senate Repub-
licans are taking steps to issue sub-
poenas to a wide variety of Obama ad-
ministration officials who have some 
relationship to the abuses I have just 
laid out. The American people deserve 
answers about how such abuses could 
happen, and we intend to get those an-
swers. 
I have been a strong supporter of law 
enforcement and the intelligence com-
munity during my career. The Amer-
ican people sleep safer because dedi-
cated people are protecting our coun-
try and bringing our foes to justice. It 
is precisely because I support these 
missions that I feel so strongly this 
malpractice cannot be tolerated and 
must never be repeated. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE DISILVESTRO 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Now, 
Madam 
President, on another matter, it is my 
honor to help bid farewell to a distin-
guished staff leader, who has himself 
handled 
sensitive 
security 
matters 
with great care and dedication. 
For more than 30 years, this body has 
functioned more safely and smoothly 
because Mike DiSilvestro was on the 
clock as Director of the Office of Sen-
ate Security. Mike D.’s job is tough to 
describe. That is partially because long 
tenured all-stars like Mike have a way 
of carving out their own niche, but it is 
mostly because his work is literally 
classified. Mike has been in charge of 
the Office of Senate Security almost as 
long as I have been in the Senate. 
He came on board as Acting Director 
in 1987. He took over a brandnew office 
with incredibly important and sen-
sitive functions. The details are not for 
public consumption, but let’s say there 
were two main missions. 
First, Mike has managed, modern-
ized, and expanded the secure facilities 
and systems that provide classified in-
formation in the Capitol to Senators 
and committees as we govern the coun-
try. He has simultaneously been a dip-
lomatic liaison to the executive branch 
and has advocated for the Senate’s pre-
rogative, and he has been a skillful 
manager of people and logistics, who 
has made sure our secrets stay secret 
once they arrive here. 
Second, Mike has been one of our top 
leaders on the security of the Senate 
itself. He helps to plan for contin-
gencies and guard every facet of our in-
stitution, its people, and its systems 
from outside actors with bad inten-
tions. 
These are tall orders—even for a fel-
low graduate of the University of Lou-
isville. Consider how much has changed 
in the 37 years since Mike first came to 
the Senate and in the 32 years he has 
held this job: major wars, terrorist 
strikes on the homeland, anthrax in 
the Hart Building, countless techno-
logical advances that have made his 
task radically more complex. Imagine 
guarding some of the Nation’s most 
closely held secrets, planning for pos-
sible attacks on the institution, and 
still being unanimously described by 
your colleagues as calm, cool, and 
even-keeled. 
Mike is no cheap people pleaser. His 
duties don’t permit it. When you see

Mike outside his secure facility and 
heading our way, it does not mean a so-
cial call—it means bad news—and you 
had better believe this stoic sentinel 
has had to say no a lot more than yes. 
Just doing the job half as reliably and 
reassuringly as Mike is a herculean 
task by itself, but then factor in the 
fact that he is also one of the most per-
sonally well-liked and respected col-
leagues among the circle of folks with 
whom he has worked. 
Mike D.’s reputation extends far out-
side the Senate. I have it on good au-
thority that, when Secretary of De-
fense Esper—who served as national se-
curity adviser to a former majority 
leader—comes to Senate Security to 
brief us Members, he doesn’t consider 
his visit complete until he has stopped 
in Mike D.’s office to check on his old 
colleague. 
Yet, ironically, outside a select cir-
cle, most people in the Senate itself 
probably could not pick Mike D. out of 
a lineup. I guess, when everything you 
work on is strictly ‘‘need to know,’’ 
you wind up on a need-to-know basis 
yourself. Even Mike’s own teammates 
describe his approach as somewhat 
‘‘stealth-like.’’ 
In short, even to his beloved Senate, 
Mike has remained somewhat mys-
terious. It is definitely a good sign for 
all of us that he has never become a 
household name, but some careful in-
telligence work on our own has turned 
up clues about Mike D.’s next assign-
ment. His well-earned retirement will 
bring more hikes, more long runs, a lot 
more golf, and more time with the fam-
ily he treasures. He may miss his col-
leagues and the importance of his job, 
but I don’t think tears will be shed for 
the end of those heroically long com-
mutes on I–95 which took place at all 
hours, day and night, whenever duty 
called. 
I can’t offer Mike any higher praise 
than to repeat what he actually al-
ready knows. 
The Senate has been safe and secure 
for more than a generation because of 
you. Decades of Senators have gotten 
the information we need because of 
you. Some people spend their whole ca-
reers wondering if they have made a 
difference. You have not needed to ask 
that for almost 40 years, and you will 
never need to ask it again. 
Mike, we are going to miss you, but 
old habits die hard, and we simply 
aren’t willing to sever all ties. 
So, this morning, the Senate will of-
ficially designate Mike as Senate Secu-
rity’s Director Emeritus. The Office’s 
first-ever Director will become its 
first-ever Director Emeritus. 
But don’t worry, Mike. Your new job 
description will just be a little bit 
lighter. I hope the biggest mystery you 
have to tackle for a while will be 
whether to play 9 holes on Saturday or 
fit in 18. The Senate and your country 
thanks you for everything you have 
done. 
DIRECTOR EMERITUS OF SENATE 
SECURITY 
OF

The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 582) designating Mi-
chael P. DiSilvestro as Director Emeritus of 
Senate Security of the United States Senate. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, and the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 582) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’)

sence of a quorum.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate Banking Committee this 
morning will hear testimony from Sec-
retary Mnuchin and Federal Reserve 
Chairman Powell about the economic 
distress caused by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. This testimony from the Sec-
retary and the Chairman of the Fed is 
one of the requirements that Senate 
Democrats secured in the CARES Act, 
and we have been pushing for it to hap-
pen for several weeks. The fact that it 
has taken so long is, once again, one 
more indication that our Republican 
Senate colleagues are not focused on 
the COVID crisis but on other diver-
sionary issues, as witnessed by Leader 
MCCONNELL’s speech, which I will have 
something to say about in a few min-
utes. 
It could not be more urgent that they 
are testifying. The COVID–19 pandemic 
has thrown over 35 million people into 
sudden 
unemployment, 
the 
highest 
level since the Great Depression. Chair-
man Powell has said that further lay-
offs can continue for months. The an-
guish that so many people feel. With-
out further action, Powell said, we risk 
‘‘prolonged recession and weak recov-
ery,’’ with unemployment reaching 20 
percent or even 25 percent. In Chair-
man Powell’s words, it may be that 
Congress has to do more, and the rea-
son we have to do more is to avoid 
longer damage to the economy. Those 
are Chairman Powell’s words, a non-
political 
appointee 
by 
President 
Trump. 
Mr. Powell’s testimony this morning, 
hopefully, will jolt my Republican col-
leagues into action, finally. At the 
very least, his testimony should awak-
en them from their slumber and compel 
some understanding of the scope and 
urgency of the problem at hand. Maybe 
his speech will somehow galvanize our 
Republican colleagues into coming for-
ward and talking about COVID, doing 
oversight of COVID, and coming up 
with the kinds of plans that we saw in 
COVID 4.0 in the House that are so well 
needed. Maybe they will talk about 
things like this. Are they for aiding 
State and local governments? Are they 
for so many of the things in the bill— 
more help for hospitals, more help for 
testing, more money for PPE, more 
help for those who have lost their jobs, 
or are they not? All we hear is silence 
from our Republican colleagues. 
I sat on the House and Senate Bank-
ing Committees for decades. I may hold 
the record for attendance at hearings 
with Fed Chairs, so I can state that 
Chairs of the Federal Reserve, whether 
appointed by Democratic or Republican 
Presidents, do not frivolously suggest 
that 
more 
congressional 
action 
is 
taken—rarely, do they do that. They 
try to avoid it. That is another reason 
why Chairman Powell’s comments are 
so important. If he feels the need to 
push this Congress, and particularly 
this Republican Senate, to act, prob-
lems must be deep and real, and most 
Americans know it, but our Republican 
Senate colleagues don’t seem to. 
We are looking at an economic situa-
tion ‘‘without modern precedent’’ in 
Powell’s words. We can either take ac-
tion to soften the blow to businesses, 
families, workers, and average folks or, 
through inaction, prolong the recession 
and hamstring our Nation’s recovery. 
Up until now, it seems our Republican 
colleagues are, unfortunately, choosing 
the latter: no immediate need for ur-
gent action. Amazing. Amazing. This is 
the greatest crisis America has faced in 
decades and decades. 
Now my colleagues like to point out 
the costs of the House Democratic bill 
to provide another round of emergency 
relief. Republican leadership has taken 
time to assail parts of the Democratic 
bill that account for 0.0003 percent of 
the bill. They are not expected to like 
every single piece, but they are ex-
pected by the American people to act, 
and, mark my words, the American 
people will force them to act. 
There are so many costs to inaction, 
and none other than the Republican-

May 19, 2020 
appointed Chairman of the Federal Re-
serve is saying that those costs are 
likely greater than the costs of any re-
lief bill. When will our Republican Sen-
ate colleagues start to get the mes-
sage? 
Looking at the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate, you would never guess that we are 
in the middle of a national economic 
crisis. For 3 weeks, Leader MCCONNELL 
has not scheduled any legislative busi-
ness related to the coronavirus. Senate 
Republican leadership is not even dis-
cussing their response to COVID–4 in 
the House. 
Instead, this week, the Republican 
leader has scheduled five rightwing 
judges for the floor of the Senate. The 
Republican chairman of the Homeland 
Security Committee will hold a hear-
ing tomorrow designed to slander the 
family of the President’s political op-
ponent, delving into a Kremlin-con-
cocted conspiracy theory that has no 
truth and fell over like a dud in the im-
peachment hearing. Last night, the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee 
announced that his committee will 
soon consider subpoenas relating to an-
other conspiracy theory pushed by 
President Trump, this time to try and 
rewrite the history of Russian inter-
ference in the 2016 election to match 
the fantasy in President Trump’s head. 
What does Leader MCCONNELL devote 
more of his floor remarks to today? 
That wild conspiracy theory aimed at 
somehow smearing the fine reputation 
that President Obama has well de-
served. It is amazing that was the bulk 
of the speech. 
Leader MCCONNELL, stop listening to 
President Trump and his wild theories 
and listen to the American people. We 
need action. We need action now. Every 
day, every week, and now almost every 
month we wait. The recession gets 
deeper and worse. More people are un-
employed. More people lose their jobs, 
more small businesses are in jeopardy, 
and we are talking about some wild 
theory because President Trump de-
manded it, when everyone knows the 
President’s penchant for truth is at a 
bare minimum, as exemplified by his 
hydroxychloroquine 
comments 
last 
night. 
Wow. This is unbelievable. In the 
midst of historic unemployment and 
economic and health tragedy, Senate 
Republicans are using their majority 
to simply block and tackle for the 
President’s reelection campaign. Sen-
ate Republicans are using their major-
ity not to tackle the COVID crisis but 
to block and tackle for the President’s 
reelection campaign. In the midst of a 
public health crisis, Senate Repub-
licans are diving headfirst into the 
muck to smear the family—the fam-
ily—of the President’s political oppo-
nent. 
It is such a gross misuse of the power 
of the majority. We were sent here to 
do the Nation’s business. At the mo-
ment, that means helping our constitu-
ents through a time of immense chal-
lenge and hardship, but Senate Repub-
licans are using their committees to 
hold fishing expeditions dictated by the 
President’s Twitter feed, which even 
his supporters don’t usually believe. 
If anyone doubts this is about poli-
tics; that this is about Senate Repub-
licans doing the bidding of President 
Trump’s personal political agenda, just 
remember what House Minority Leader 
MCCARTHY said before the last Presi-
dential 
election. 
Leader 
MCCARTHY 
went on FOX News bragging that the 
Republicans put together a Benghazi 
select committee to bring Hillary Clin-
ton’s poll numbers down. Now Senate 
Republicans are using the same play-
book to smear President Trump’s polit-
ical opponents once again. It will not 
work. 
The American people know it is a cri-
sis. They know the Republicans are 
doing nothing right now. They know 
that this is political folderol to please 
President Trump and will not solve 
America’s problems. Rightfully, many 
Americans are just furious at Senate 
Republicans using their majority to 
pursue the President’s political agenda 
in a time of national crisis. 
The President is tweeting insane con-
spiracy theories, demanding that his 
water carriers on Capitol Hill make 
them look legitimate. Instead of focus-
ing on testing capacity and policies to 
safely reopen our country to help so 
many individuals and businesses that 
are in need, the President is telling the 
press that he has taken an unproven 
treatment, hydroxychloroquine, for a 
disease he doesn’t have. That is reck-
less. 
Please, citizens of America, don’t 
take hydroxychloroquine as a preven-
tion for COVID, and medical experts 
have said it is not. Remember, it is 
risky. The FDA has said it has risks. 
This is a medicine that experts say, at 
best, may not be effective in treating 
or preventing COVID–19 and, at worst, 
causes serious heart problems in pa-
tients with certain conditions. 
It is astonishingly reckless. I don’t 
know why the President did it. Maybe 
he has family or friends who stand to 
benefit from the popularity of this 
drug. It wouldn’t be unlike the Presi-
dent that someone called him who said 
it is a great drug, and he just talks 
about it. He has no penchant for re-
search or science or even truth. It just 
pops into his head, and he thinks it 
sounds good. He thinks it is a diversion 
from his failures—which are so many— 
for dealing with COVID. He just says it. 
He doesn’t care if it hurts people. He 
just says it. But I do know this. If the 
President was focused on testing or 
production of PPE or fashioning a care-
ful plan to reopen the country instead 
of pushing quack medicines and invent-
ing new conspiracies, the country 
would be in far better shape than it is 
today, and the country knows it. 
The majority of Americans don’t 
trust the President to handle this cri-
sis, and Senate Republicans just say 
how high when he says jump, no matter 
how off base, false, or unrelated to 
COVID his theories are. 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE DISILVESTRO 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
would like to echo the kind words said 
by the majority leader about Mike 
DiSilvestro as he prepares to head into 
retirement on Friday after 37 years of 
service to the U.S. Senate. 
Mike serves as director of the Office 
of Senate Security and is in charge of 
the secure facility here in the Capitol 
where Senators can receive classified 
briefings and review sensitive docu-
ments. There are very few individuals 
who have given as much time and at-
tention to this institution as Mike 
with so little recognition or fanfare— 
such is the nature of the job—but on 
the cusp of his retirement, I hope he 
will allow us to pay him a few com-
pliments. 
Mike’s counsel is wise. His word can 
be trusted implicitly. His focus is al-
ways on serving the institution, never 
on politics or party. His judgment and 
guidance have always been excellent, 
and he did not rely on subtlety. When 
you walk into the Senate’s secure facil-
ity, you pass a World War II-era poster 
reminding you that ‘‘loose lips sink 
ships.’’ His job has had many difficult 
responsibilities, and Mike was never 
more valuable or trusted than in dif-
ficult times. 
He tracked down absent Senators on 
9/11. He comforted terrified staff wait-
ing to be decontaminated after ricin 
was discovered in Senator Frist’s mail-
room. During the anthrax incident, he 
donned a biohazard suit and entered 
the contaminated Hart building to re-
trieve vital documents from Senator 
Daschle’s office. Even now, in the mid-
dle of a public health crisis, Mike has 
faithfully reported to duty to make 
sure this institution is able to com-
plete its constitutional work. 
I know he is finding this attention on 
the floor today uncomfortable. I don’t 
know if he is still here. Yes, sorry for 
all the flattery, but it is well deserved. 
He is accustomed to working entirely 
outside the limelight. He will never be 
quoted in the paper, and I suspect he 
will never write a tell-all book about 
his time in the Senate, but for those of 
us here, Senators and staffers alike, we 
will long remember his sense of humor, 
his devotion to family, his work ethic, 
and his strong, principled leadership. 
There are only a very few staffers 
who are both known and respected by 
every single Senator. Mike is one of 
the few. His absence will be felt by all 
of us. 
Mike, I wish you well. I hope you fi-
nally get to play all the golf you want, 
complete the Appalachian Trail, and 
that you enjoy every day of your well- 
earned retirement. Congratulations. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 579 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
some of you at home may be old 
enough to remember a distinct circular 
scar on your upper arm. You may re-
member a parent or grandparent who 
had one. That mark was probably one 
of the world’s greatest public health 
successes—the eradication of the dead-
ly smallpox virus. That so many alive 
today no longer remember the death 
and misery caused by this disease is a 
testament to global efforts in a cooper-
ative manner. 
The smallpox virus likely originated 
more than 3,000 years ago and was one 
of the most devastating diseases ever 
in the history of humanity. It was 
barely visible under the most powerful 
microscope and was known for fiery 
bumps covering the face and body, pro-
fuse internal bleeding, black vomit, 
and pieces of destroyed skin that would 
shed off one’s body. 
Smallpox is estimated to have killed 
up to 300 million people in the 20th cen-
tury—300 million—and around 500 mil-
lion in the last hundred years of its ex-
istence. 
In 1967, the World Health Organiza-
tion launched a historic, intense effort 
to 
eradicate 
smallpox. 
The 
global 
eradication 
effort 
initially 
used 
a 
strategy 
of 
mass 
vaccination 
to 
achieve 80 percent vaccine coverage in 
each country and, thereafter, used con-
tact tracing—familiar with the word?— 
to reduce and rein in additional out-
breaks. 
Ultimately, the global eradication of 
smallpox was certified and endorsed in 
1980, making it one of the most suc-
cessful collaborative public health ini-
tiatives in the history of the world. In 
fact, this month marks the 40th anni-
versary of the World Health Organiza-
tion’s historic achievement: the end of 
smallpox. 
Similar global efforts have been 
taken to deal with diseases such as 
polio and Ebola. So imagine my con-
cern and that of the rest of the world 
that, 
amid 
the 
devastating 
global 
coronavirus 
pandemic, 
the 
United 
States decided just recently to sit out 
a conference to collaborate and raise 
funds to research, manufacture, and 
distribute a possible coronavirus treat-
ment and vaccine. 
Just as with the smallpox effort, 
such a global collaborative approach 
makes sense, being both morally and 
strategically the thing to do to save 
lives around the world. You see, joining 
forces with other countries would help 
speed up the development and eventual 
distribution of a coronavirus vaccine 
that we all desperately seek. It would 
save lives in America, but it would also 
save lives around the world. 
No one knows—no one knows—where 
the vaccine will eventually be per-
fected or produced, so we should be on 
this. The United States should be at 
the table. We should be part of the col-
lective global effort to find this vac-
cine. 
Clearly, other world leaders get it. 
They understand the obvious impera-
tive of raising $8 billion to be spent 
over the next 2 years. Eight billion dol-
lars is a massive sum of money until 
you place it up against the price we are 
currently paying for this virus. 
Our allies in the European Union and 
Norway came to this table that the 
United States vacated, or refused to at-
tend, and each pledged $1 billion to-
ward this $8 billion goal. 
Who was absent from this critical ef-
fort to save lives around the world, in-
cluding lives in the United States? 
Sadly, it was the United States itself. 
We were not part of this virtual global 
conference. You see, again, another 
short-sighted and critically missed op-
portunity to address the coronavirus, a 
question about what this administra-
tion was thinking. Why were we miss-
ing in action when all of these coun-
tries came together? 
I don’t know where this vaccine will 
be found. It will be a great source of 
pride if it is in the United States. I 
have the greatest confidence in the 
men and women who are researchers 
and the businesses prepared to produce 
and develop it. I have the greatest con-
fidence in them. But what if the very 
safest vaccine, the most effective vac-
cine, the one that is proven to be the 
best comes instead from England or 
Germany? Does that mean we will not 
use it because it is not the American 
vaccine? We know better than that. We 
want the safest, most effective vaccine, 
wherever it may come from, to be 
available to the world and, certainly, 
to the United States of America. 
Supporters in Congress said little or 
nothing when it came to the decision 
to vacate and to not be present at this 
international conference. The Presi-
dent has blamed others for problems 
that we face today, but it was his deci-
sion not to participate in this global 
conference on the vaccine. It could 
have devastating consequences. 
So what does it mean for America? 
Well, we continue to have some of the 
world’s best researchers: experts at the 
National Institutes of Health, the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, and many universities and private 
researchers that work across the coun-
try and around the world. Many NIH- 
funded researchers have spent years 
studying coronaviruses. Their knowl-
edge could help to pave the way for fu-
ture breakthroughs. 
I applaud them, and I have to tell 
you, for the last 4 or 5 years there has 
been a quartet of Senators of both po-
litical parties who have given dramatic 
investments to the National Institutes 
of Health for additional research. We 
have been led by ROY BLUNT, the Re-
publican chair of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee, as well as LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER, the Republican chair of the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. PATTY MURRAY has 
always been at the forefront of this ef-
fort, and I have done my best to back 
them up every way possible. 
We have had a 30-percent or more in-
crease over the last 4 years in research 
at the NIH, so I believe in the NIH, and 
I have made it a major part of the job 
that I have undertaken here in the U.S. 
Senate with my bipartisan colleagues. 
Clinical trials, we know, are under-
way at NIH for vaccines. I want to 
commend that agency; Dr. Fauci, a 
friend of more than 20 years; and Dr. 
Collins, the same, for their tireless, un-
wavering, and inspired effort. But it is 
plausible, as I mentioned earlier, that 
the best vaccine candidate may turn up 
in some other country, not in the 
United States; that it will be some 
overseas company that decides to ini-
tiate and lead the production of the 
vaccine. 
In a rush to research and validate a 
vaccine, ramp up production, and ad-
dress global allocation and supply 
needs that would ensure affordability 
and access worldwide, where will the 
United States stand: in the fray, in the 
battle, or on the sidelines? 
Last week we decided to stay on the 
sidelines and not to work with global 
partners to find this vaccine. When the 
United States pursues a go-it-alone ap-
proach while the rest of the world is 
working together, where does that 
leave us? That is why last week Sen-
ators Schumer, Murray, Leahy, Menen-
dez, Murphy, Duckworth, and nearly 
three dozen others joined me in intro-
ducing a straightforward resolution 
that calls on the United States to join 
these global efforts. 
I am grateful to organizations like 
PATH, Shot@Life, Better World Cam-
paign, and the UN Association of the 
United States for their support of this 
resolution as well. Quite simply, we 
should be part of these efforts to not 
only offer American expertise but to 
share in lifesaving benefits. 
We used to have a profound, well doc-
umented, proud bipartisan history of 
such effort. For example, I was pleased 
to rally around President Bush’s call to 
stem the scourge of AIDS around the 
world through the historic PEPFAR 
Program. Many of my Republican col-
leagues in the Senate supported these 
efforts. 
Now we face this coronavirus out-
break. I was equally proud of President

Obama’s efforts to set up infectious 
disease prevention systems and his 
leadership on the Ebola crisis. 
I have been told that one of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle is 
going to object to enacting this resolu-
tion this morning. I wanted to read the 
resolution clause that this colleague 
will be objecting to. I want those who 
are following this debate to ask wheth-
er they find this objectionable. 
Here is what it says: ‘‘. . . calls on 
the United States Government to boost 
funding for and strengthen collabora-
tion with key multilateral institutions 
at the forefront of responding to 
COVID–19, such as the Coalition for 
Epidemic 
Preparedness 
Innovations; 
Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance; and the 
Solidarity Trial.’’ 
This is not a radical or partisan sug-
gestion. We did our best to make it 
nonpartisan because it should be. Does 
anyone in this country care if the re-
searcher who finds that vaccine is a 
Republican or a Democrat? I certainly 
don’t. We shouldn’t care, either, wheth-
er it is found in the United States or 
another country. I would be so proud if 
it is found here, but if there is a safe 
and effective vaccine found in another 
country, we certainly want to partici-
pate in its discovery, its production, 
and its distribution. To stay on the 
sidelines at that point in history would 
be disastrous. 
Last Friday I was driving from Chi-
cago to Springfield. It is about a 3-hour 
and 15-minute ride. I had plenty of 
time in that rental car to listen to a 
lot of radio, but it was interrupted—in-
terrupted by the President who, in a 
press conference, made it clear to us 
that he was going to address the need 
for this global vaccine, as he said, at 
warp speed. 
I have disagreed with this President 
on a lot of things, but I sure don’t dis-
agree with that statement. The sooner 
we can find it, the better, and I want 
the United States to use all of its re-
sources to make it happen. 
The President was asked in a press 
conference afterward what that meant 
in terms of sharing this vaccine with 
the world, and he said, ‘‘We’ll do it.’’ It 
was a simple statement. There was no 
reservation. He made a pledge right 
then and there that, if we discover this 
vaccine, it will be shared with the 
world. Thank you, Mr. President. That 
was the right thing to say, at the right 
moment, as the whole world was 
watching to see the United States’ 
leadership. 
What I am calling on in this resolu-
tion is simply that we use our expertise 
and an investment—and we make in-
vestments every day in global efforts— 
that we use this for a collaborative ef-
fort, a global effort, to find this vac-
cine. As I have said from the beginning, 
it will be a great source of pride if it is 
found here, but if it isn’t, if there is a 
safer or effective vaccine that is avail-
able and it is discovered in another 
country, what difference does it make, 
if it saves lives in America and around 
the world. 
Let’s be part of this effort. Let’s set 
our pride aside and, instead, talk about 
the impact it would have on the people 
today who are in fear, suffering and, 
sadly, dying as a result of this global 
virus. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent, as in legislative session, that 
the Committee on Foreign Relations be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. Res. 579 and the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration. I further 
ask that the resolution be agreed to, 
the preamble be agreed to, and the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, let me state the 
resolution referred to by my friend 
from Illinois is comfortably residing in 
the Foreign Relations Committee at 
the present time and is subject to the 
regular order of Congress and of the 
committee. 
There is almost nothing that the 
Senator said that I disagree with, al-
though from time to time I do disagree 
with my good friend and colleague 
from Illinois. 
I think that this is a matter of most 
consequence to the United States of 
America today, and certainly the pur-
suit of a vaccine and/or a cure are of 
utmost importance. I think that the 
process by which we go through that is 
incredibly important. 
Like the Senator from Illinois, I am 
a huge fan of the NIH and, for that 
matter, the CDC, which do great things 
for the public health system in not 
only America but in the world. They 
are vastly underappreciated. They are 
much like the electric switch in our 
rooms. Every morning, we get up and 
turn on the electricity and everything 
is fine, and we just take it for granted 
and don’t even think about it. That is 
true of the NIH and the CDC. They do 
good work regardless of whether we are 
thinking about it. 
In America, we have something more 
than just a government effort when it 
comes to public health. We have this 
great machine called the free market 
and 
free 
enterprise 
system 
that 
incentivizes Americans, through the 
private sector, to do great and glorious 
things. 
Indeed, while my good friend from Il-
linois was bragging on the efforts by 
other countries to pursue the kinds of 
things that are needed, within the last 
24 hours we have had a very important 
announcement from part of our private 
sector, which is making great strides 
in this regard. 
I think it is important that we do ac-
cept that there are various ways that 
we can and should pursue the vaccine 
and the cure for this horrible scourge. 
This matter is a lot deeper than that. 
It is the intent of our committee to 
hold hearings and develop very com-
prehensive legislation regarding how 
we pursue this in the future. What has 
just recently happened to us is of great 
interest to all of us but not nearly as 
important as what is going to happen 
to us in the future. 
There are parts of S. Res. 579, if not 
the vast majority of it, that I hope will 
be included when we get to what, hope-
fully, will be a comprehensive piece of 
bipartisan legislation to address this. 
Some of the whereases I am not too 
red-hot about, but as far as the resolu-
tions are concerned, certainly, they 
state things that there would be una-
nimity, I think, in agreement. 
Where are we going with this? What 
my friend from Illinois has raised is a 
very small facet—an important facet 
but a small facet—of what we are going 
to do, what is the intent of our com-
mittee to do, going forward in what I 
think will be a bipartisan fashion. 
Again, like I said, I hope we are able to 
include these. I welcome the Senator’s 
participation and all Members of the 
Senate’s participation as the Foreign 
Relations Committee does move for-
ward on some comprehensive legisla-
tion. 
What do we know for sure right now? 
I think Senator DURBIN did an excel-
lent job of taking us through history 
when it comes to some of the things we 
have had in the past like smallpox, 
AIDS, polio, and Ebola. And, certainly, 
the United States has been a leader and 
will be a leader on this particular 
scourge. 
The WHO—and, for that matter, 
other world organizations—have been 
large players, important players, help-
ful players in those efforts in the past 
on smallpox, AIDS, polio, and Ebola. 
Again, I come back to, just as an exam-
ple, polio. A huge factor in that was 
not the U.S. Government involve-
ment—well, it was a huge factor, but 
another huge player in that were pri-
vate citizens, a couple in the United 
States, Bill and Melinda Gates, who 
played a huge role in eradicating polio, 
working with the WHO, working with 
the USG, and many others. 
I have no doubt, as we go forward on 
this, there will be that type of collabo-
ration in the future. As the good Sen-
ator noted, this is not a political issue. 
This is not a Democratic issue. It is 
not a Republican issue. The virus 
doesn’t care who you are or what you 
are. It is just looking for a home. We 
need to deny it that home, and we will. 
I think we will make great strides as 
we go forward. 
What do we know for sure right now? 
What we know is that this particular 
virus evolved in China, particularly in 
Wuhan Province, and specifically in a 
species of bat. 
What we also know is that there are 
about 2,000, so far, identified viruses 
that are in the same position that are 
carried by bats in the Wuhan Province. 
What we also know is that a virus has 
escaped from China before. There is a 
lot of speculation as to exactly how

this happened. We know that the virus 
jumped species, from the bat to a 
human being and then went around the 
world. 
We also know, for a fact, that this 
particular virus, like all viruses, acts 
uniquely. It is not exactly the same as 
other viruses that have jumped species 
and gone around the world. This one 
was unique in that, unlike some of the 
ones we have had in the past—this is 
our sixth experience since 2003 with the 
virus—this moved around the world at 
an incredibly fast speed. It was much 
more like a house on fire than the 
other diseases that we have talked 
about, like smallpox or polio. Its speed 
was unique. It was new. It was dif-
ferent. 
As a result of that, historical organi-
zations that have dealt with these in 
the past were not expecting it and were 
not geared for it. They thought this 
virus would move much like the others 
that we have dealt with. The result of 
that, of course, was that it got away 
from us, from the world, and we now 
find ourselves in the position we are in 
because that happened. 
It is my hope, and it is my objec-
tive—and hopefully will be the objec-
tive of our committee, eventually the 
objective of the U.S. Senate, and hope-
fully eventually the objective of the 
world—that we develop a protocol for 
dealing with a virus or, for that mat-
ter, any other health challenge that 
moves at the speed of light and like a 
house on fire as opposed to a small, 
creeping thing that we have had in the 
past in some of the other challenges we 
have had. 
It is different. There is no doubt it is 
different. It is going to have to be dealt 
with differently, and we are going to 
have to develop a protocol that does 
address this speed. It is going to en-
tail—and this is probably the heaviest 
lift of all of it we are going to do—the 
200 governments around the world to 
come together and agree that when 
something like this happens in their 
country, instead of covering it up or in-
stead of making political excuses, or 
instead of hoping it is going to go 
away, that instead they call the fire 
department. And the fire department 
will be a new agency or perhaps even 
one of the old agencies that we have 
had that are geared to handle a pan-
demic that moves at this speed or pre-
sents other challenges. 
The institutions we have simply 
aren’t geared to do that, which we 
found out with this epidemic. I think a 
good example is, as my good friend 
from Illinois mentioned, the Ebola 
challenge we had. The historical insti-
tutions, I think, dealt quickly with 
that and really held down the damage 
from it, which could have been much 
worse than what it was. We need to de-
velop protocols for dealing with this. 
This is going to be a challenge. There 
is no question it is going to be a chal-
lenge because politics comes into this 
simply because of governments in the 
various 200 countries around the world 
have to deal with this. When they do 
deal with it, they have different ways 
of dealing with it. 
As chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, I deal with our diplomats 
who deal with the diplomats from 
other countries. We deal with them on 
the committee directly, but since this 
thing has hit, we haven’t had as much 
direct contact, but our diplomats have 
continued to have contact. In talking 
with them, one of the things I find par-
ticularly disturbing is, I ask: Are the 
Chinese humble about this? How are 
they dealing with this? What is their 
view of what has happened here? Inter-
estingly enough, they take it as an op-
portunity to compare our form of gov-
ernment to their form of government. 
And they say: Look, we had a problem; 
we dealt with it. You guys had the 
same problem, and you dealt with it. 
And the reason is because we have this 
strong authoritarian central govern-
ment that can control people and can 
control people in the most severe fash-
ion, and we can deal with it. You peo-
ple, with all these freedoms and your 
democracies, you have speech, you 
have these political arguments, you 
have these disagreements, and you 
allow dissent, and when you have that, 
you can’t deal with it. Therefore, our 
form of government is better than your 
form of government. That is very dan-
gerous talk. 
I am disturbed and disappointed the 
Chinese Government has viewed this as 
they have and has not viewed it as we 
have, as a challenge that is going to 
take historical changes as we go for-
ward. That is a huge challenge as we go 
forward, but that shouldn’t stop us 
from making every effort that we can 
to go forward, and we will. 
On the Foreign Relations Committee, 
it is our intent to hold hearings to de-
liberate, as the U.S. Senate does, and 
to produce what hopefully will be a bi-
partisan piece of legislation, which is 
substantially broader than what we 
have here, but hopefully that will in-
clude many of the things that we have 
here, and that will include—as the good 
Senator from Illinois has indicated— 
the necessity of including other gov-
ernments in the effort as we go for-
ward. 
I commit to Senator DURBIN, and I 
commit to all that our committee will 
undertake this challenge. It is within 
the jurisdiction and the responsibility 
of our committee. We take it seriously. 
We are still in the throes of this, al-
though it feels like we are on the down-
hill side and are starting to come out 
of this. As we go forward in a very 
commonsense, deliberative fashion, we 
hope to construct legislation that will 
address all of these very serious issues. 
If there is one thing we know for 
sure—and I am absolutely convinced of 
it—this is going to happen again. Given 
the physical situation on the ground in 
Wuhan, China, and given the fact that 
there are 2,000 other viruses, probably 
some of which are substantially worse 
than this—and, for that matter, the 
same situation in other parts of the 
world—this is going to happen again. 
Given the population of the world and 
given the culture of the way we live 
today in the world and our travel and 
interconnectedness, this is going to 
happen again. 
We need to be ready for it. We need 
strong legislation that will address 
this, not only at the U.S. level but also 
at the international level. The United 
States has been the world leader in 
world health issues, and I anticipate 
that we will continue to be like that. 
At the present time, it is under consid-
eration in our committee. At the 
present time, we can’t go forward with 
this. 
Before I state an objection, I want to 
yield to my good friend from Indiana, 
who also has some ideas in this regard, 
and all of which will be, I am sure, con-
structive on both sides of the aisle. I 
want to yield the floor to Senator 
BRAUN at this time. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). Is there an objection? 
Mr. RISCH. Not yet. 
I want to yield to Senator BRAUN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 658 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I ob-
ject, but my colleague from Illinois is 
not wrong. I think after I get through 
explaining my objection, hopefully, 
there will be something we can work 
out. 
The United States should be engag-
ing more in global efforts to find treat-
ments and vaccines for coronavirus. 
Governments, academic institutions, 
scientists, researchers across the world 
are racing to do it. The United States 
must work at home and with inter-
national partners to develop treat-
ments and vaccines. There is no reason 
we can’t be doing something on our 
own and working with others across 
the world. 
This is a joint venture, if there ever 
has been one. However, the nonbinding 
resolution that my colleague has of-
fered is not an actual solution. I come 
from the world—and one of the frustra-
tions for being here for just a year and 
a half is that we don’t get more stuff 
across the finish line. I have a real so-
lution to ensure Americans benefit 
from the vaccine and treatment devel-
opment efforts happening across the 
world. My bill, the ADAPT Act, S. 658, 
as amended, would create an expedited, 
almost automatic approval process at 
the FDA for vaccines and treatments 
that might occur across the world. We 
do not have the market cornered on 
good ideas. 
These countries have all developed 
regulatory systems that are compat-
ible and that should make us feel com-
fortable. But instead of just talking 
about it, which we do so much of here, 
this bill would actually establish the 
approval reciprocity for treatments 
and vaccines between the FDA and 
other trusted counterparts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2488 
May 19, 2020 
If one of them approves a vaccine or 
treatment, they are quickly, almost 
automatically, approved here in the 
United States with my bill. We cannot 
afford miscommunication or bureau-
cratic foot-dragging with something so 
important. My bill ensures that regu-
lators will work proactively to get 
Americans a vaccine as soon as pos-
sible. 
Look at the early testing missteps 
we did have with the CDC. I mentioned 
that in the briefing last Tuesday. Their 
overly proscriptive approach delayed 
our testing capability for the first 40 
days. The result has been a one-size- 
fits-all approach of locking down the 
economy, which I think we will see 
some of the disadvantages of that over 
the next few months. 
When my staff talked with the FDA 
about working with international part-
ners on treatment and vaccine develop-
ment, the FDA assured them that they 
have everything under control and are 
speaking 
with 
their 
international 
counterparts. The FDA assured my 
staff that they have covered the issues 
that might come into play when you 
are having a partnership with some-
body else. The FDA is promoting the 
idea and having the doors open for de-
velopers to submit data and to seek ap-
proval for treatments and vaccines. 
Until we have a vaccine, reopening 
will be gradual. We need herd immu-
nity and vaccines to be the final solu-
tion to this saga we are going through, 
but we cannot afford bureaucratic ob-
stacles slowing down regulatory ap-
provals for a successful vaccine. 
As we have seen, certain steps of vac-
cine development can be achieved at 
warp speed to cut down on development 
time, but regulatory approvals will not 
be one of them unless we take legisla-
tive action. 
The ADAPT Act is real action, not 
just talk, specifically designed for 
times like this when scientists across 
the world are racing to develop treat-
ments and vaccines. 
Therefore, with my prior objection, I 
do not want to leave my friend from Il-
linois emptyhanded. 
Madam President, in hoping my col-
league from Illinois will not object, as 
in legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 658 and the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. I further ask 
that the Braun substitute amendment 
at the desk be considered and agreed 
to; the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed, and that 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. First, let me say to my 
friend and colleague from Idaho, thank 
you. The tone of your remarks are 
positive, constructive, bipartisan. That 
is exactly what the American people 
are looking for, at least in Illinois, and 
I will bet you in Idaho as well. 
This national emergency, this public 
health crisis, should bring out the best 
in us and not the most political side of 
our nature. Thank you because I think 
your remarks were offered in that re-
spect. 
We have been here now 3 weeks. This 
is the third week since returning from 
a break where most of us were at home. 
I think this is the longest period of de-
bate on the coronavirus we have wit-
nessed on the floor of the Senate in 3 
weeks. 
I thought this 3-week period would be 
all about COVID–19, all about the vac-
cine. It hasn’t. We have taken up many 
other things that have nothing to do 
with it. What we have talked about 
here this morning is encouraging to 
me. If bringing this resolution up with 
a unanimous consent request is going 
to lead to the Senate Foreign Relations 
and other committees moving forward 
on important policy questions that you 
raised, and I hope I raised as well, then 
it was not time wasted. It was time 
well spent. 
We do agree on so much more than 
we disagree, I am sure of it, when it 
comes to this. I invite you, I encourage 
you, I beg you, as soon as we return 
from next week’s recess, the sooner we 
can bring a hearing before your com-
mittee and others the better. 
I would like to address the unani-
mous consent request of my colleague 
from Indiana as well. 
It has been my good fortune in the 
House and Senate to work with the 
Food and Drug Administration. It is 
probably one of the most underrated 
agencies of our Federal Government. 
They make decisions, literally, life- 
and-death decisions, every single day of 
things unimaginable to us. It is hard to 
look at all of the things they regulate 
and inspect and not be impressed. I 
have been impressed over the years 
with the Food and Drug Administra-
tion. But the gold standard of the Food 
and Drug Administration, which was 
established at least 60 years ago with 
the Thalidomide scandal, was that this 
agency was to take a look at drugs 
that were about to go on the market in 
America and conduct tests, ask ques-
tions, do their own research to deter-
mine two things: Are they safe, and are 
they effective? Safe and effective. That 
is it. But it is a lot. 
Over the years, for 60 years or more, 
they have used this standard to judge 
drugs, clinical trials, which carefully 
measure the impacts of a drug on the 
human body over a period of time and 
the like. It is frustrating because, at 
times, it takes longer than we wish. 
There are exceptions that have been 
created at the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration 
for 
extraordinary 
cir-
cumstances wherein it can accelerate 
the process, but by and large, it has to 
judge drugs as being safe and effective. 
Nearly three-quarters of drugs today 
are approved in the United States by 
the Food and Drug Administration be-
fore they are approved in any other 
country around the world. The FDA is 
considered the gold standard. I have 
been told that so many times. Many 
countries look to the Food and Drug 
Administration in the United States to 
see if it has approved of a drug’s being 
safe and effective before they move for-
ward. This demonstrates that the Food 
and Drug Administration has an awe-
some responsibility but is doing a good 
job in ensuring Americans have timely 
access to the same drugs as have pa-
tients in other countries. 
The ADAPT Act, which Senator 
BRAUN brings to the floor, is a solution, 
I believe, in search of a problem. Sadly, 
it runs a real risk. This notion that we 
are somehow going to open up the pos-
sibility of a drug’s having been ap-
proved in another country being ap-
proved in the United States quickly, 
without any review, I think is a dan-
gerous thing to do. 
To 
date, 
we 
know 
what 
the 
coronavirus has done to us, and we also 
know that this bill would completely 
change how drugs would be approved 
for sale in the United States of Amer-
ica. It is not a minor bill. It is a major 
change. Under current law, if a phar-
maceutical company wants to sell a 
drug, it needs the approval of the FDA. 
It tests it to be sure it is safe and effec-
tive. It is the gold standard. 
The Senator’s proposal would abolish 
this method. That is significant. In-
stead, the Senator’s proposal says, if a 
drug has been approved by another de-
veloped country—I am not sure of his 
definition of a ‘‘developed country’’—it 
can bypass standard U.S. regulation 
and come to market without going 
through the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration’s study, review, and approval. 
It is worth noting that many Mem-
bers of the House and Senate have 
criticized the pharmaceutical industry 
for charging Americans the highest 
drug prices in the world. I have been in 
that chorus from time to time and 
have suggested that drug prices in the 
United States should be the same as 
they are in Canada and Europe for the 
same drugs. Many times, people on the 
Senator’s side of the aisle have resisted 
that suggestion. They have called it so-
cialism and have said we shouldn’t let 
other countries dictate what America 
has to pay for drugs. Yet, now, appar-
ently, Senator BRAUN is comfortable 
with letting other countries dictate 
whether our drugs are safe and effec-
tive. 
This bill is not a targeted response to 
the coronavirus; it is an open-ended 
giveaway to some pharmaceutical op-
eration. More importantly, it is put-
ting our safety at risk in America, 
which we never ever want to do. In-
stead of approving the resolution I in-
troduced that simply expresses the sup-
port for global coordination, Senator 
BRAUN wants to completely overturn 
our Nation’s drug approval process. 
This bill was introduced more than a 
year ago. It is still in search of a co-
sponsor, and it hasn’t been consented

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2489 
May 19, 2020 
by 
the 
Republican 
Committee 
on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions, which oversees the FDA. Now is 
the time for the best and the brightest 
from all nations to work together to-
ward the shared goal of ending this 
pandemic and finding a safe and effec-
tive vaccine. It is not the time to com-
pletely upend our Nation’s drug ap-
proval process to make it easy for some 
countries to flood our market with un-
safe and ineffective drugs. 
For these reasons, I object to Senator 
BRAUN’s counterproposal. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard for both unanimous 
consent requests. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, this 
may be a rare moment of some 
collegiality on the idea in general. I 
think the American public and, espe-
cially, I, who is one who has watched 
this place operate for so many years in 
my leading up to the point when I ran 
for the Senate, accept the kind of guid-
ance that there may need to be more 
fleshed out, and the Senator objected 
to it. 
Yet I think the American public de-
serves action out of this place, and so 
often it seems we dawdle and do not 
get to the point. Look at how long it 
took the body to come to an agreement 
on criminal justice reform. One of the 
first questions I asked when I got here 
was, How long have you been working 
on it? The answer—10 to 12 years. When 
you look at what we do get accom-
plished here, I think we need to figure 
out how we become more effective, how 
we get things done more quickly, and 
how we pay for it in the long run. 
So I am going to savor the moment 
we have here. We are at least talking 
about it. Hopefully, we will be able to 
work with my neighbor from Illinois to 
still push the idea that this is a critical 
time and that we need to get some-
thing done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I be-
lieve there is a unanimous consent re-
quest pending. Has there been an objec-
tion to my original unanimous consent 
request? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tions were heard to both unanimous 
consent requests. 
The Senator from North Carolina. 
REMEMBERING TOM COBURN 
Mr. BURR. Madam President, I think 
divine intervention has played a part 
here with this exchange and the com-
ments of my colleagues because I am 
here to pay tribute to my good friend 
Tom Coburn, who, on March 28, passed 
away—our colleague and, more impor-
tantly, a dear friend. I almost sat in 
the cloakroom and then came out here, 
thinking this could be a conversation 
that Dr. Coburn could be having on the 
Senate floor about the need to accom-
plish things, to think outside the box. 
Yet, as my good friend from Illinois 
said, don’t destroy the gold standard 
that is there; find a way to work within 
it. Dr. Coburn had a lifetime of doing 
that. 
To pay tribute to a friend and a col-
league, I actually have to rewind 26 
years, when both Tom Coburn and I 
came to the House of Representatives 
in a large class. It was alphabetical, so 
you can see how ‘‘B’’ and ‘‘C’’ would be 
close and how Chambliss would be a 
friend and Latham. We were a cadre of 
folks who really sized up very quickly 
whom it could trust. 
To understand Tom Coburn is to un-
derstand that this was a guy with an 
incredibly diverse background in that 
he ran a medical device company, in 
that he was an OB/GYN, in that he ex-
perienced things in life and, in my 
case, was a little bit older. To under-
stand Tom Coburn is to remember the 
commercial wherein the bull went into 
the china store, and no matter which 
way it turned, it was always going to 
break something. Tom believed that 
you had to break something to under-
stand whether it was important or 
whether it was just clutter. 
I think, like every new Member of 
Congress, you come in with a belief 
that you are going to change the world 
but have no idea how to do it, and you 
find that people who have been there 
for their careers hold all of the cards, 
and that is the knowledge of how that 
legislation was crafted and why it was 
done. To understand Tom Coburn is to 
realize that this didn’t scare him. Tom 
knew a lot, and when he hit things he 
didn’t know, he sounded like he did; 
therefore, people were scared to take 
him on. 
As a member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, on which we both 
served, Tom was incredibly instru-
mental in healthcare policy, in medical 
device issues. Tom was a practicing OB/ 
GYN when he got to the House and 
then, later on, when he got to the Sen-
ate, and he never could understand why 
he could not go back to Oklahoma on 
the weekends and deliver babies. Now, 
this is a man who had delivered tens of 
thousands of babies over his career in 
Oklahoma, but the way the Senate 
rules are—they are so antiquated—you 
couldn’t go home and keep up your li-
cense to deliver babies because you 
could not earn money. Tom challenged 
that when he was in the U.S. Senate. 
He challenged that antiquated rule, 
and he lost. 
So, as I sat and listened to this de-
bate that was about healthcare, I could 
only sit there and think about the ar-
gument that Tom Coburn had made 
about this antiquated rule that what 
you came in with and practiced in ci-
vilian life you had to throw overboard 
here. You could no longer do it. Tom 
decided he would go back on the week-
ends and deliver babies. Yet, rather 
than have them make payments to 
him, they would make payments to 
nonprofit organizations in his home-
town of Tulsa, and they would make 
them commensurate as to what they 
could afford. 
So, for a guy who was perceived as 
the right of the right hard-liner, Tom 
was probably one of the most compas-
sionate individuals. He was one of the 
individuals who understood the com-
mon person, because, in his mind, he 
was one his entire life—one who was 
never privileged, who earned every-
thing he got, and who banked every-
thing he learned. Ultimately, at the 
end of his career, he used that for this 
institution, for the American people, 
and for people around the world. 
Early on, I remember Tom and my 
sitting down with John Dingell, the 
former Democratic chairman of the 
Energy 
and 
Commerce 
Committee. 
John Dingell, who was a great man and 
whom Tom and I both liked a lot, ei-
ther wrote every bill that came out of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
or his dad did before him for, probably, 
60 years. John had an inherent advan-
tage every time we argued legislation 
because he either wrote it or his dad 
wrote it. He knew why he did it, and he 
knew why they structured it the way 
they did. I think John recognized 
something in Tom—that here was a 
guy who could bring fresh life to it. 
At the time, I remember Chairman 
Dingell sitting us down and saying: 
Guys, spend a year listening, not a 
year talking. 
Well, that was easy for me to do be-
cause I didn’t know a whole lot when I 
got here, but that was the toughest 
thing Tom Coburn was ever faced with 
was to be silent because he really came 
in and wanted to change the world in 
short order. 
When he got there, Tom said: I will 
only be here for 6 years. 
He 
accomplished 
a 
tremendous 
amount. His imprint is felt by the peo-
ple in the House today. You might re-
member he was probably the loudest 
voice for government waste—for the 
size of what we spent, for how much we 
took from the American people, and for 
what bad stewards we were of how we 
used it and spent it. I think Tom left 
with peace from the House of Rep-
resentatives because, for the first time 
in our lifetimes, the budget was bal-
anced. 
None of us anticipated what would 
happen in 2000 and the effects of 9/11, 
and nobody was more shocked than I, 
in the same year I came from the 
House to the Senate, to see Tom 
Coburn run as a Senate candidate for 
the State of Oklahoma. Tom came in 
with the same belief that we needed to 
change things and that we needed to do 
it quickly. Tom served on the House 
Intelligence Committee. When he got 
to the U.S. Senate and served on the 
Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom 
understood much better the challenges 
with which we were faced. I will not 
say that his approach changed but that 
Tom assessed what was possible and 
never went for what was impossible. 
There are Senators in this Chamber 
who haven’t had the good fortune to 
serve with a Tom Coburn, who haven’t 
been influenced and educated by some

of the things Tom Coburn impacted 
many of us with—those of us who spent 
our entire careers with him. Yet the 
American people will feel the benefits 
of Tom Coburn’s education here, his 
imprint on this institution. 
JAMES LANKFORD, the Senator from 
Oklahoma, picked up his ‘‘Pig Book’’ 
that he put out every year, which is a 
list of those insane expenditures that 
Tom Coburn used to come up with on 
an annual basis to make us all feel 
shameful 
about 
the 
appropriations 
process. Thank goodness Tom Coburn 
did that because JAMES LANKFORD still 
does it today on an annual basis. 
I probably can’t point to anything 
more important than healthcare to tell 
you how Tom’s impact on this institu-
tion has been felt, and I think it will be 
felt for years to come. Tom and I be-
lieved that there was a different direc-
tion, not because we were smart but 
because the one we were on didn’t 
work. 
I remember sitting down with Dr. 
Coburn, and he said: We are going to 
change the healthcare architecture. 
I said: Tom, you have been doing this 
for a long time. What architecture 
works? 
He said: Well, we are going to have to 
try them all, and when we find one 
that doesn’t fail, we will know that one 
is right. 
When he got to that point, without 
hesitation, Tom came to the Senate 
floor and talked about the Patients’ 
Choice Act over and over and over 
again. In the 3 or 4 years since Tom has 
been gone from the institution, the de-
bate has shifted. In fact, where Tom 
Coburn was and where he tried to tell 
our colleagues we needed to settle—in 
empowering 
patients 
and 
bringing 
transparency to healthcare—is some-
thing we struggle with today. 
There was no bigger advocate for 
transparency in healthcare costs than 
Tom Coburn, and when the administra-
tion tried to administer that this year, 
hospitals went to court and won— 
meaning, they don’t have to publish 
pricing. To the average person, that 
makes no sense. For those of us who 
had been on the frontline with Tom 
Coburn, finally, an administration had 
done it only to see it overruled. Yet, 
even on the day he died, it was one of 
the key things that Tom believed—that 
transparency was absolutely essential 
in the healthcare process. 
I can remember Tom was not new to 
cancer. I think he fought cancer four or 
five times. One day, during his most re-
cent battle, we were coming up on the 
Christmas holiday, I remember, and I 
think he was in his chemotherapy 
treatment. He was still in the U.S. Sen-
ate, and Tom was exhausted at the 
time. In between votes, he would go to 
the cloakroom and lie down on the 
couch. Everybody knew he didn’t feel 
well. When he would get up to vote, we 
would look at the pillow. It looked like 
a cat had been on it as Tom’s hair 
would stay on the pillow. Now, he 
never lost it all, but we understood the 
challenges he was going through in his 
own personal life that he never ex-
pressed with any of his colleagues or 
friends. 
I have never seen a person who bat-
tled as peacefully as did Tom Coburn. 
His impact will be felt for generations 
to come, not just here but by the kids 
he delivered in Oklahoma, who today 
are 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 years old—kids 
who will grow up reading about their 
hero from Oklahoma. 
Though Tom had a distinguished con-
gressional career and will be remem-
bered for a lot of legislative victories, 
that is not Tom Coburn’s greatest 
claim to fame. I have never known an 
individual more devoted to a wife than 
Tom Coburn was to Carolyn. She was a 
beauty queen. She was when she was 
young, and she was, in Tom’s eyes, on 
the day he died. He loved her without 
question. Tom also loved his daughters. 
He was so proud of their accomplish-
ments. He and Carolyn worked to make 
sure they finally moved so they had ev-
erybody close. I think Tom knew that 
the wheel of luck was going to run out. 
Yet, you see, that is not the way Tom 
looked at it. He wanted to spend every 
precious moment with his wife, his 
kids, and his grandchildren. He wanted 
any impact and impression he could 
make to be on that next generation of 
Coburns. 
For all of the qualities in Tom 
Coburn that I could talk about, there is 
not enough time to really praise him. 
It would take days, and it would take 
many individuals to come up and do it. 
It is probably impossible to say good-
bye to a friend like Tom Coburn. To 
me, there is no question that I came to 
trust and value everything that Tom 
stood for. 
The one thing about Tom Coburn 
that many people knew was that Tom 
had this tremendous peace about him-
self. I think some might have thought 
it was because Tom had had such a 
stellar background and had known so 
much. The truth is, if you had sat and 
talked to Tom, you would have found 
out the truth. Tom loved his Lord 
Jesus Christ. He didn’t hide it. When 
given the opportunity, he wanted to 
share that peace with anybody who was 
willing to sit and listen. Tom was criti-
cized for where he lived because it was 
certainly religious in leaning, but that 
was Tom’s life. As much as he adored 
his 
wife 
and 
children 
and 
grand-
children, he adored his Lord just as 
much. 
My colleagues were blessed to have 
Tom Coburn’s influence on this institu-
tion. Not everybody in America under-
stands how blessed they are to have 
had his influence on the policies and 
the way future generations will be im-
pacted by Tom Coburn for all of his 
works. Today Tom may be in Heaven— 
no, today Tom is in Heaven, and I 
would bet my colleagues that he is giv-
ing them hell. He is up there trying to 
change the architecture of the deck 
chairs. He is up trying to say: Why do 
we do things this way and not that 
way? 
One of the things that used to bug 
Tom about this institution is he 
couldn’t figure out why we had tele-
phones in the U.S. Senate that looked 
as though they were created in 1950. 
You might remember, about 5 or 6 
years ago, the Senate got new phones. 
They still will not redial from the last 
number you called, and they still look 
like they are from the Soviet era of the 
1950s, but that is the way the U.S. Sen-
ate is, and that is what Tom was trying 
to change. In many aspects he may not 
have changed the telephone, but he 
changed the institution. He changed 
the way we look at it. 
Although he may be challenging the 
rules in Heaven today, make no mis-
take about him, he is still preaching 
the Word and he has always believed 
that Word. For all of the things Tom 
Coburn tried to accomplish, he did it in 
a way that his Lord would have been 
proud of him. 
My colleagues, I know others will 
pay tribute to Tom Coburn’s work 
here. I am here today to pay tribute to 
Tom Coburn’s life, not just the impact 
he had on this institution or the Con-
gress of the United States as a whole 
but the example he set for all of us 
that life doesn’t have to be fair. But we 
as individuals have to be committed, 
and Tom Coburn was committed to ev-
erything in life that he did. I am sure 
today Tom continues to preach com-
mitment to those who will listen. 
With that, I honor his passing, and I 
say this to him in the spirit that it is 
meant. Several days after we got word 
that he had passed, I said to my wife: 
With 
COVID–19 
and 
Congress 
dis-
located, what would Tom Coburn have 
done? She looked at me and she said: 
He would have grown a beard. 
We all remember those days when, all 
of a sudden, he would show up, and the 
beard was grown, and he would say: 
Until this is over, I am not going to 
shave. And that day I decided not to 
shave. 
I was going to give this tribute to 
Tom Coburn last week. The events of 
last week didn’t permit me to come do 
that tribute, and I couldn’t make it

shaved because it was the most aggra-
vating thing that I have ever had, and 
I understood why in 64 years I hadn’t 
grown any facial hair. I proved that I 
could do it because I was honoring my 
friend. 
I hope that others in this institution 
will look on Tom Coburn’s contribu-
tions in the same way I do, as a very 
special exposure that we all had. 
With that, I yield the floor.

our agenda. We are monitoring imple-
mentation of the $2.4 trillion of the 
coronavirus funding that we provided, 
and we are talking to experts about 
what is needed to help our country re-
open. Our committees, where so much 
of our key legislative work is done, 
have held a number of coronavirus 
hearings over the past 2 weeks, and 
there are more on the agenda. 
This week, the Committee on Aging 
will hold a hearing on caring for sen-
iors during the coronavirus crisis. The 
Senate Banking Committee will hold a 
hearing with Treasury Secretary Steve 
Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair-
man Jerome Powell to discuss imple-
mentation of the Coronavirus Aid, Re-
lief, and Economic Security Act—the 
CARES Act—which was our largest 
coronavirus relief bill. 
The Homeland Security and Govern-
ment Affairs Committee will hold a 
hearing to consider the nomination of 
Brian D. Miller to be special inspector 
general for pandemic recovery at the 
Treasury Department. With just an 
ounce of cooperation from Democrats, 
we 
could 
confirm 
this 
important 
watchdog yet this week. 
Finally, the Commerce Committee, 
of which I am a member, will be in ex-
ecutive session to consider legislation 
and 
nominations, 
including 
two 
coronavirus bills. 
Of course, while coronavirus remains 
our top priority, we are also focused on 
doing the other business the American 
people expect us to do, from funding 
our government to protecting our Na-
tion. Last week, the Senate voted to 
reauthorize three expired provisions of 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Act that provide essential tools to our 
law enforcement and intelligence com-
munities, as well as a number of re-
forms to strengthen privacy protec-
tions and guard against abuses. 
We have also been considering nomi-
nations for key administration posts, 
including Director of National Intel-
ligence and Secretary of the Navy. This 
week, we expect to confirm a nominee 
to reestablish a quorum at the Federal 
Election Commission, as well as a num-
ber of nominees to fill vacancies on 
Federal district courts. 
So that is what the Senate has been 
doing. What has the House of Rep-
resentatives been up to? Well, until 
last Friday, the answer was not much. 
But on Friday, the House brought its 
Members back to Washington to vote 
on a massive, $3 trillion piece of legis-
lation the Democratic leaders billed as 
coronavirus relief. In reality, as one 
House Democrat pointed out, the legis-
lation is nothing more than a mes-
saging bill—that from a House Demo-
crat. 
Under the guise of coronavirus relief, 
House leaders put together a massive 
package of liberal priorities that they 
well knew would be dead on arrival 
here in the U.S. Senate. How unserious 
is their bill? Well, the Democrats’ leg-
islation 
mentions 
the 
word 
‘‘can-
nabis’’—‘‘cannabis’’—more often than 
the word ‘‘jobs.’’ 
Let me repeat that. House Demo-
crats’ legislation mentions the word 
‘‘cannabis’’ more often than the word 
‘‘jobs.’’ 
In case Democrats didn’t realize, 
Americans are not suffering from lack 
of cannabis right now. They are suf-
fering from a lack of employment. 
Let me mention some other high-
lights of the Democrats’ legislation: a 
tax cut for millionaires and billion-
aires; stimulus checks for illegal immi-
grants and deadbeat dads; environ-
mental justice grants to study pollu-
tion; significant changes to election 
law—that is really related to the 
coronavirus—a ban on sharing informa-
tion about lower cost health insurance 
options; and more. I could go on. The 
list literally goes on and on. 
Unfortunately, while Democrats were 
focused on federalizing election law 
and requiring studies on diversity in 
the cannabis industry, they forgot 
about a few basics. Their bill does not 
include any meaningful plan to get 
Americans back to work. It provides 
hardly any relief or support for small 
businesses. It doesn’t touch the issue of 
liability 
reform—even 
though 
pre-
venting frivolous coronavirus lawsuits 
will be key to getting our economy 
going again—and it doesn’t do any-
thing to hold China accountable. The 
Democrats’ bill is a fundamentally 
unserious bill at an incredibly serious 
time. 
Democratic leaders knew from the 
beginning that there was no chance of 
this legislation getting through the 
Senate or being signed by the Presi-
dent. In fact, Democrats had some 
work to do to persuade members of 
their own caucus to vote for the bill. 
As POLITICO put it, ‘‘As of late Thurs-
day evening, the House Democratic 
leadership was engaged in what a few 
senior aides and lawmakers described 
as the most difficult arm-twisting of 
the entire Congress: convincing their 
rank and file to vote for a $3 trillion 
stimulus bill that will never become 
law.’’ 
Unfortunately, Democratic leaders 
were successful in their arm-twisting, 
and the bill did pass the House, albeit 
with some Democratic defections. 
I have talked about the liberal wish 
list in this bill, but I haven’t men-
tioned the other aspect of this pro-
posal, 
and 
that 
is 
the 
enormous 
pricetag, a portion of which, of course, 
wouldn’t 
even 
go 
to 
anything 
coronavirus-related. My friends across 
the aisle think that all problems can be 
solved with more money or a new gov-
ernment program, but they can’t. And 
spending too much money can actually 
hurt rather than help Americans. 
So far, we have spent $2.4 trillion to 
fight the coronavirus. That is a tre-
mendous amount of money, but these 
are extraordinary circumstances, and 
they call for an extraordinary re-
sponse. We may very well have to 
spend more before this pandemic is 
over, and if we need to, we will. But we 
have an absolute obligation to make 
sure we are spending only what is need-
ed. 
Every dollar we have spent so far on 
this pandemic is borrowed money— 
every single dollar. It is money we 
needed to borrow, and we were glad to 
do it, but we do need to remember that 
it is borrowed money, and the younger 
workers and our children and grand-
children are going to be paying for it. 
We have an obligation to them to bor-
row only what is absolutely necessary 
to fight and beat this virus. Diversity 
studies 
for 
the 
cannabis 
industry 
should not be making that cut. 
Some of the Democrats’ proposals 
might be acceptable at another time, 
and I emphasize the word ‘‘some.’’ But 
no matter how worthy the proposal, 
there is a limit to what we can respon-
sibly spend, and we have to prioritize 
measures that will directly fight the 
virus and get Americans back to work. 
Republicans are also focused on de-
veloping measures that will help fight 
the virus and get our economy going 
again without spending trillions of dol-
lars—something I might recommend to 
my Democratic colleagues. We are cur-
rently working on a package of liabil-
ity protections. Personal injury law-
yers are already filing coronavirus-re-
lated cases, and we need to ensure that 
frivolous lawsuits don’t hamstring our 
economic recovery while ensuring that 
real cases of gross negligence and mis-
conduct are punished. 
We are considering a lot of other 
measures to provide relief while driv-
ing up the national debt as little as 
possible, such as regulatory reform and 
tax protection for healthcare workers 
who cross State lines to provide their 
services. I am pushing for approval of 
my Mobile Workforce State Income 
Tax Simplification Act, which I intro-
duced last year, along with Senator 
SHERROD BROWN. 
Our 
legislation 
would 
create 
an 
across-the-board tax standard for mo-
bile employees who spend a short pe-
riod of time working across State lines. 
It would ensure that States receive fair 
tax payments while substantially sim-
plifying tax requirements for employ-
ees and employers. This legislation has 
particular relevance in the age of 
coronavirus, with doctors and nurses 
crossing State lines to voluntarily 
work in States that have been hit hard 
by the pandemic. 
The Governor of New York is looking 
to cash in on the pandemic and has al-
ready threatened to subject these med-
ical professionals to New York’s in-
come tax. We need to make sure that 
doctors and nurses who travel to other 
States to help fight the coronavirus 
aren’t rewarded with big tax bills. 
Partisan messaging bills, such as the 
one the House Democrats passed last 
week, are a waste of Democrats’ time 
but, more importantly, do nothing to 
serve the American people. How many 
hours did the Democrats spend on their 
massive liberal wish list—hours that 
could have been spent working with 
Republicans to come up with real relief

measures? But that is pretty much par 
for the course for Democrats these 
days. They are intent on remaking 
America according to their ever more 
extreme leftist agenda. They are cer-
tainly not going to let a national crisis 
get in the way. In fact, more than one 
leader of the Democratic Party has 
spoken with pleasure of the oppor-
tunity the pandemic presents to re-
make America in their far-left image. 
It is deeply disappointing that Demo-
crats are more focused on their pet 
projects than on addressing this pan-
demic and its consequences, but that 
will not stop the Republican-led Senate 
from moving forward with the business

NOMINATION OF JAMES E. TRAINOR III 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
we are here to vote on a nominee, 
James Trainor, to be a Commissioner 
at the Federal Election Commission— 
the independent agency responsible for 
enforcing Federal campaign finance 
laws. 
I am deeply disappointed in today’s 
vote, which is a departure from the 
Senate’s longstanding tradition of con-
sidering FEC nominees on a bipartisan 
basis and another step in eroding the 
traditions of the Senate—all for a can-
didate who holds extreme views toward 
the agency to which he would be ap-
pointed. 
Prior to today, the Senate has voted 
to confirm 47 FEC nominees, and 42 of 
those nominees have been confirmed 
through a bipartisan process. As the 
ranking Democrat on the Rules and 
Administration Committee, I have re-
peatedly urged my Republican col-
leagues to work with us to get the FEC 
running again, as it is unacceptable 
that the agency charged with pro-
tecting the integrity of our campaign 
finance system has been without a 
quorum for 261 days—the longest pe-
riod without a quorum in the agency’s 
history—but this is not the way to do 
it. 
The FEC has been plagued by par-
tisan gridlock for years. With a general 
election only 168 days away, we should 
be working together to make sure that 
the agency is working to the fullest ex-
tent possible. Americans are tired of 
hyperpartisanship and gridlock. This is 
not the time to abandon the bipartisan 
tradition of moving FEC nominees to-
gether. We need to work to restore 
their trust in our political institutions, 
and with this vote, we are taking a 
step backward. We all know that our 
campaign finance system is broken. 
Everyone in this room knows it. Spend-
ing on campaigns has gotten out of 
control, and special interest groups are 
a major part of the problem. 
Experts suggest that at least $6 bil-
lion will be spent in the 2020 election 
cycle 
on 
political 
advertisements 
alone. That doesn’t count the billions 
that will be spent by the campaigns 
themselves and the additional billions 
spent by dark money groups and spe-
cial interests which are trying to influ-
ence this election. In order for our de-
mocracy to work, we need strong rules 
for campaign spending, and we need a 
strong agency to enforce those rules. 
We should be working together, on a 
bipartisan basis, to propose solutions 
to try to get the FEC back on track. 
I have a few ideas. We should work 
together to pass legislation to reform 
the FEC’s rules so it functions better. 
We should establish a working group 
that will investigate bipartisan solu-
tions to improve the function of the 
FEC. We should also work together to 
elect strong nominees from both par-
ties who will serve on the Commission 
with the understanding that they are 
there to enforce the law and protect 
our election system—and, oh, does this 
election system need protecting right 
now. 
We are in the midst of a pandemic. 
We have people standing in garbage 
bags and homemade masks in the rain 
in Wisconsin just trying to exercise 
their right to vote. Nearly 50 of those 
people got sick. We have a poll worker 
who got sick. We have States all over 
the country, with both Democratic and 
Republican Governors, that are des-
perately trying to get funding so we 
can have more at-home voting and 
have the polls open earlier and have 
them open for days so people don’t 
have to all congregate on 1 day, and on 
that day we have to also make our 
elections safer. We have a lot to do. 
When it comes to elections, we know 
that the enforcement agency for things 
like campaign finance is the FEC. We 
know it is broken, and we as a body 
should work to improve it. 
My Republican colleagues, on this 
particular nominee, have repeatedly 
said that by confirming Mr. Trainor 
they are doing some good restoring a 
quorum. OK. That is not the full story 
of this nomination. It ignores the fact 
that gridlock will persist, and Repub-
licans have intentionally left a Demo-
cratic seat on the Commission vacant 
for more than 1,100 days. 
It ignores the fact that Leader SCHU-
MER and I referred a Democratic can-
didate to the White House for consider-
ation and that she has been vetted and 
cleared. She is immensely qualified, 
and she would be the first person of 
color to ever sit on the FEC. Yes, that 
is right, the first person of color not 
only in this Congress but the first per-
son of color in the history of the Fed-
eral Elections Commission to serve on 
the Commission.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2493 
May 19, 2020 
Since Republicans refuse to move 
forward in a bipartisan manner, the 
agency charged with enforcing our 
campaign finance laws will continue to 
remain ineffective. This undermines 
our country’s political institutions, 
and it does not serve our country’s best 
interests. 
Many people refer to the Senate as 
the world’s greatest deliberative body 
because the Senate, as an institution, 
is designed for the careful consider-
ation and debate of legislation and 
nominations. When we erode the bipar-
tisan norms that make us the greatest 
deliberative body, we end up allowing 
unqualified nominees who hold ex-
treme views to be appointed to impor-
tant positions in our government just 
at a time when we should be doing the 
opposite. 
In addition to these process concerns, 
today we are also being asked to move 
forward with a nominee to the FEC 
who doesn’t believe in basic campaign 
finance law. The FEC was created to 
enforce campaign finance law, so it is 
critical that the agency be staffed by 
Commissioners who believe in its mis-
sion so it can police people from both 
parties. 
Mr. Trainor has consistently worked 
to dismantle the rules that keep cor-
ruption out of our political system. He 
has spent his career arguing that peo-
ple should not have to disclose polit-
ical spending and has worked to stack 
the deck against voters by gerry-
mandering districts in Texas to dilute 
minority voting power. 
Trainor’s views on disclosure are in-
consistent with decades of Supreme 
Court precedent, including the views of 
late Justice Scalia. When fellow Re-
publicans in the Texas Legislature 
worked to require politically active 
nonprofit 
organizations 
to 
disclose 
their donors, Trainor challenged them 
and said that such a law ‘‘would have a 
chilling effect on anybody’s ability to 
speak.’’ 
Let’s just step back. Those were fel-
low Republicans on the Texas Legisla-
ture simply trying to put some reforms 
in place so we knew where those dona-
tions were coming from, and he spoke 
out against that. 
Moving forward with this nomination 
today may restore a quorum, but it 
does not serve the American people. 
The American people deserve an FEC 
that works, an agency that enforces 
the law and protects our political sys-
tem from corruption. At a time when 
unprecedented amounts of dark money 
and foreign money are flowing into our 
elections and influencing our courts, a 
fully functioning FEC is critical to 
safeguarding our political system. 
When it comes to the agency in 
charge of enforcing our campaign fi-
nance laws, the absolute minimum 
qualification should be that the person 
actually believes in the mission of the 
agency. Is that too much to ask? 
We need to focus on how we can help 
the American people safely vote during 
this pandemic. I mean, we need to 
focus on this pandemic, instead of the 
series of votes that we have seen this 
week, but if we are going to decide who 
should serve on the FEC during this 
pandemic, it should be someone who 
believes in the mission of the FEC. 
We need to work together to hold 
hearings with bipartisan groups of elec-
tion officials, like we have been work-
ing to do on the State level when it 
comes to how to vote in this pandemic. 
There has been a lot of good work 
going on with Republicans and Demo-
crats, Governors and Secretaries of 
State. We need to do the same thing in 
this Chamber as we approach major 
legislation and as we approach our 
working with the FEC. 
I oppose the process by which this 
nominee has come to the floor, and I 
believe the nominee’s extreme views 
are disqualifying for this important of-
fice. I strongly urge my colleagues to 
vote no on this nominee. 
I yield the floor.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
Americans have come together in this 
moment. We have come together to de-
feat the coronavirus. We have come to-
gether to ramp up testing, to ramp up 
healthcare, and to reopen our commu-
nities and our country. 
The coronavirus has brought out the 
best in so many ways in America and 
in the American people. From our 
frontline healthcare workers taking 
care of patients to scientists and re-
searchers working on testing, on treat-
ment, and on vaccines, to those in pub-
lic service keeping essential parts of 
the government running day in and day 
out, to those working on supply chains 
to deliver goods 24 hours a day, and to 
those who are staying at home to keep 
themselves and keep others safe, Amer-
icans are in this together. 
It is interesting because all we are 
seeing from the other side of the polit-
ical aisle is more of the same old poli-
tics 
and 
name-calling.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2494 
May 19, 2020 
Obama is taking cheap shots at Presi-
dent Trump; Speaker PELOSI just put 
out a $3 trillion bill that reads like the 
Democratic Party platform; and Joe 
Biden is holed up and hiding in his 
basement. Is this the best the Demo-
crats can offer? Is this the best they 
can do? Biden, Obama, and PELOSI 
should be embarrassed. This is not 
leadership. 
Republican policies in the CARES 
Act that we passed actually have had 
significant results—real results—with 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
making sure 50 million Americans are 
still getting their paychecks, economic 
impact payments, which are reaching 
130 million families. These are policies 
that are going to build a bridge for the 
country to get to the other side of the 
devastation done by the virus, and, 
still, more money and resources from 
the CARES Act are slated to go out to 
States, to hospitals, and to small busi-
nesses all across America. 
All together, between Congress and 
the Federal Reserve, we have injected 
close to $9 trillion into the economy in 
just a couple of months. All of this 
money is nowhere close to having even 
been spent. In fact, it is only because of 
the steps we have taken already—the 
efforts of Governors across the coun-
try, the work of this administration— 
that the House Democrats have found 
themselves in a position, as they were 
last Friday, of wasting time and energy 
on a fantasy bill. 
Republicans now have two jobs. The 
first is to get the country back on 
track, and the second is to not allow 
the Democrats to try to exploit the cri-
sis that is upon this country for their 
own political gains. 
Democrats are pushing their agenda 
as a cure-all for the virus. Let me be 
clear. It is not. It is simply a solution 
for their electoral problems. 
Yesterday, the New York Times pub-
lished a front page article. Online it 
was called ‘‘Seeking: Big Democratic 
Ideas That Make Everything Better.’’ 
In the printed copy, they changed the 
headline to say: ‘‘Biden Pursues Ideas 
to Match Scale of Crisis,’’ ‘‘Left Senses 
an Opening for a Bolder Agenda.’’ The 
article goes step by step on how the 
pandemic is being used by the Demo-
crats to make sweeping changes in 
their policy platforms in their effort to 
remake America, basically consistent 
with their dangerous Democratic so-
cialist views. 
They are planning, according to this, 
to get rid of their so-called center-left 
policies that they had additionally and 
initially envisioned. They are now 
courting what they call leftwing allies. 
They are adopting the ideas of single- 
payer healthcare—one size fits all 
healthcare, with the government mak-
ing decisions for you rather than you 
or your doctor making decisions for 
you. They are adopting ideas through 
labor unions, liberal think tanks, pro-
gressive institutions. They have taken 
over the Democratic Party, and they 
are all beholden to NANCY PELOSI. 
Democrats are using the coronavirus 
so that their favorite groups get a give-
away. That is what it reads when you 
take a look at that $3 trillion bill that 
NANCY PELOSI dragged across the floor 
of the House last Friday night with 
Members of her party kicking and 
screaming about voting for it. That is 
what we see. 
Some were kicking and screaming 
because the $3 trillion bill that started 
as a $1.5 trillion bill didn’t get big 
enough, didn’t include enough of their 
far left socialist agenda. This is not a 
solution for the crisis facing America. 
It is not a solution for the crisis that 
we are facing with coronavirus. It is 
not a solution that we are facing with 
a crisis of a shut-down economy, shut 
down by the government in an effort to 
protect ourselves from the disease. Oh, 
no. What we see here is a partisan po-
litical playbook. It is the Democrats’ 
agenda for the 2020 election. 
The efforts to get the coronavirus be-
hind us and get our communities and 
our country open must be targeted, 
must be temporary, and must be tai-
lored to the needs of our communities 
at this critical time in our Nation’s 
history. Ultimately, it is time for 
America to open swiftly and smartly 
and safely. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
first want to give a thank-you to ev-
erybody who is working right now and 
all the folks who are required to be 
here with the Senate in session. I wish 
we were focused on those things right 
now that are directly related to mak-
ing sure everybody is going to be able 
to continue to be safe and to focus on 
what we need to do to safely reopen the 
economy rather than what we are vot-
ing on this week. I want to thank all of 
you for being here. 
I also want to send condolences and 
thoughts to everyone who has lost a 
loved one in this crisis. We are ap-
proaching, this weekend, 100,000 Ameri-
cans. If that doesn’t give us a sense of 
urgency right now to effectively ad-
dress this health pandemic and to get 
this right and to work together, I don’t 
know what does. 
I rise today with a real sense of ur-
gency. I think it is important to under-
stand how we got here so we know 
what we need to do going forward. 
On January 20, the first case of 
COVID–19 was reported in the United 
States, the same day as the first case 
in South Korea. Our White House 
didn’t act. They were, unfortunately, 
more worried about the stock market 
than people in the supermarket. 
In South Korea, they did act. Within 
8 weeks, they were testing 40 times 
more people per 1 million of their citi-
zens than we were. By April 14, they 
had 10,000 cases, and we had over 600,000 
cases because there was no sense of ur-
gency to do what needed to be done to 
take this seriously. Now we know that 
we are well beyond that. 
Unfortunately, on the American side, 
in the weeks and months that came 
after January 20, the White House 
slow-walked declaring a national emer-
gency. They failed to quickly imple-
ment widespread testing that was 
being done all around the world and in 
every other country, and they dropped 
the ball on getting the essential med-
ical equipment and supplies doctors 
and nurses still need to treat people 
and keep them safe. Their reckless 
delay made us the world leader—the 
world leader—in the number of COVID– 
19 cases and deaths. When you think 
about it, we are a little over 4 percent 
of the world’s population; yet we have 
about 30 percent of the deaths because 
of a lack of urgency and the inaction 
from the very beginning to be able to 
get our country’s arms around this 
deadly virus and what was happening. 
Now 4 months have passed, and as I 
mentioned, more than 90,000 to 100,000 
Americans have passed away from 
COVID–19. Think about that. When we 
look at over 90,000 lives, that is as if a 
whole 
city 
in 
Michigan 
just 
dis-
appeared from the map; yet the White 
House and the Republican leader and 
our friends across the aisle continue to 
show a lack of urgency about this cri-
sis. 
On March 14, the House of Represent-
atives 
passed 
the 
Families 
First 
Coronavirus Response Act. It had a 
whole range of things that were incred-
ibly important in it: COVID testing so 
that you could get free testing if you 
needed it, increased Medicaid funding 
for States, extended unemployment 
help for more workers. It established 14 
days of paid sick leave for people who 
lost their paychecks because they had 
to stay home due to the virus, and the 
bill provided nutritional food for moms 
and babies and families. Yet the Senate 
leader felt no urgency to pass it right 
then. The House passed the bill on a 
Friday night, in the middle of the 
night. All we had to do was to stay 
until Saturday and get it done, but 
there was no sense of urgency for the 
nurses and the doctors and the unem-
ployed workers and the small business 
owners and the hungry families. They 
had to wait. They had to wait until the 
next week, for the Senate leader to go 
home for the weekend. The leader re-
turned to Washington, but his sense of 
urgency still wasn’t there. 
So, while the White House didn’t act 
and the Republican leader didn’t act, I 
will tell you who did act: The Gov-
ernors acted. Democratic and Repub-
lican Governors stood up, and they 
leaned in to protect their citizens. I am 
so grateful for what our Governor and 
her great team have done in Michigan 
and for all of our mayors and local 
communities that leaned in, for their 
taking whatever resources were avail-
able and putting them right out there 
to make sure people’s lives were being 
saved—the No. 1 priority. They have 
been stepping up and taking the action 
needed to save lives over and over and 
over again in this crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2495 
May 19, 2020 
Frankly, that is what the White 
House said should happen. Remember 
the words of President Trump’s when 
he tweeted: 
Governors must be able to step up and get 
the job done. We will be with you all the 
way. 
Unfortunately, when he said ‘‘all the 
way,’’ he actually meant to find your 
own way, which puts us where we are 
right now, today, in trying to help 
them get resources for critical State 
and local services. 
The vacuum of Federal leadership 
has real-life consequences. I released a 
report today that shows the price 
American families will pay if the White 
House and congressional Republicans 
refuse to support State and local serv-
ices. Our Democratic Policy and Com-
munications group, which is supported 
by all of the Democratic Senators, is 
saying we have to act. There are real 
consequences. Families and commu-
nities will pay the price if we do not 
act and step up and have their backs. 
Through no fault of their own, our 
States and local communities are fac-
ing critical budget shortfalls—up to 
$650 billion over 3 years—that far ex-
ceed what States lost after the great 
recession. Without urgent Federal as-
sistance, these cuts will affect our safe-
ty, our children’s educations, and our 
quality of life. Yet the Republican 
leader said he has not yet ‘‘felt the ur-
gency of acting immediately.’’ Maybe 
States should go bankrupt, he said. 
I can tell the White House and the 
Republican leader who feels the sense 
of urgency. He is the healthcare worker 
who has been laid off and doesn’t know 
when he will get paid and what he is 
going to do to take care of his family. 
He is feeling a sense of urgency. He is 
the student whose school might have 
to be cut back, and they are the teach-
ers who are going to be laid off through 
the severe budget cuts. They feel a 
sense of urgency. The woman who can’t 
continue treatment for opioid addic-
tion because of cutbacks at her local 
community behavioral health center 
feels a sense of urgency right now. It is 
the community that is cutting back on 
its police and fire departments and the 
9–1-1 call centers in order to save 
money because the President said that 
he would be with them all the way but 
who now is saying ‘‘No way. You are on 
your own’’ that feels a sense of ur-
gency. She is the mom who is waiting 
in line for hours in her car at the local 
food bank to try to get some food for 
her children for today, not next month. 
It is not ‘‘Hey, we have 2 or 3 months.’’ 
She wants them to eat today and to-
morrow and the next day. She feels a 
sense of urgency. 
Americans across the country are 
feeling a sense of urgency, and it is ur-
gent that we act to meet this moment 
so that they understand, in this hor-
rendous moment and through no fault 
of their own—the health crisis and the 
economic crisis and so on—that some-
one really does have their backs. We 
need to help our State and local gov-
ernments continue paying vital work-
ers who educate our children and keep 
us safe and provide all of the essential 
services. We need to extend unemploy-
ment benefits so that people who are 
out of work will be able to pay the rent 
and feed their children. We need to ap-
prove access to healthy foods for fami-
lies in need right now. We need to cre-
ate a heroes fund to ensure that essen-
tial workers who have taken the most 
risk to keep our country running, to 
keep us safe, and to save lives during 
this pandemic receive the additional 
hazard pay, the compensation, that 
they deserve. 
They need to know they are essential 
and not expendable. Just saying thank 
you is good, but it is not enough when 
you are worried about paying your own 
mortgage while you go to work to save 
somebody else’s life or put food on your 
own table for your family. Our country 
can do better for them. That is what 
the House bill did. That is what the 
Senate needs to do. 
We need to invest in our State and 
local health departments so that we 
can continue to fight the virus and 
keep 
our 
communities 
safe. 
That 
should really be a no-brainer right 
now, the fact that we need to support 
our health departments that are on the 
frontlines of tracking what is hap-
pening and get the critical information 
so the right decisions can be made to 
keep us safe and the right decisions can 
be made so as to safely reopen our 
economy, which we all want and know 
needs to happen. 
Actions have consequences. I am here 
to say that inaction also has con-
sequences. Inaction has consequences. 
We are losing lives; we are losing time; 
and every part of the economy is being 
affected. It is time to act. It is time for 
this Senate to act, not on more judges 
over and over and over again, but on 
the things that the American people 
need to have happen, that the people of 
Michigan need to have happen so they 
can be healthy and survive the virus 
and also be able to survive economi-
cally for their families, for their busi-
nesses, for their farms. 
MITCH MCCONNELL may not feel a 
sense of urgency, but I do on behalf of 
the people of Michigan. It is time for 
the Senate to act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
yield to the Senator from Oklahoma 
for a unanimous consent request. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent, at the conclusion 
of the remarks by the Senator from 
Connecticut, that I be recognized to 
speak for whatever time I may con-
sume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
concur in the remarks of my friend 
from Michigan. A lot of our constitu-
ents have long thought that there has 
just been an enormous gulf between the 
conversations that we have in the U.S. 
Senate and the conversations that are 
going on at people’s kitchen tables, 
that are going on between friends and 
neighbors at the supermarket. They 
think that what we worry about here is 
guided by lobbyists and K Street and 
political action committees and that it 
really doesn’t have much to do with 
what they care about. 
I don’t know that their perception of 
that gulf has been any bigger than it is 
right now because the message that 
Senator MCCONNELL
and the Senate 
Republicans are sending is that there is 
no urgency, that there is no need for 
the Senate to act, that we have done 
everything that needs to be done for 
the time being when it comes to the de-
pression levels of unemployment in 
this country, the lines that go on for 
blocks for families who can’t afford 
food to pick up groceries and the 
schools that are scrambling to figure 
out how the heck they are going to re-
open with the revenues for their mu-
nicipalities and counties and States 
that are cratering through the floor. 
So it just tears people’s hair out 
right now to know that there is a piece 
of legislation that has been passed in 
the House of Representatives that will 
help millions of families who are in 
meltdown crisis right now as they have 
lost their jobs, as they, maybe, have 
sick loved ones, and as they don’t know 
when life will get back to normal, but 
the Senate is doing nothing. 
I understand my Senate Republican 
friends wouldn’t have written the bill 
that passed in the House. It is under-
standable in that there is a different 
party in control of the Senate than is 
in control of the House of Representa-
tives. Of course, there is going to be a 
difference in priorities. Yet the deci-
sion to not even take up the House 
bill—to not try to amend it, to not try 
to draft a version of our own to fill 
these enormous gaps that families are 
feeling right now—is maddening to the 
people whom I represent back home 
who feel that sense of urgency that is 
not shared by the folks who haven’t 
lost their salaries or their healthcare 
benefits in the U.S. Senate. 
Earlier today, we tried to take a 
small step forward to better protect 
our constituents and try to bring this 
pandemic to an end. Senator DURBIN 
offered a pretty simple resolution that 
would have just expressed the sense of 
the Senate that we should join with na-
tions around the world to try to de-
velop a vaccine for COVID. I don’t 
agree with the President. I don’t think 
that it is all hopeless until we find a 
vaccine. I think that we can take steps 
in our communities through State 
leaders to try to reopen our economy 
even before we have a vaccine. Obvi-
ously, that is the goal for which we all 
strive, and we are much better off if we 
work with other countries to develop 
that vaccine. 
As we speak, there are very prom-
ising discoveries that are being made 
in other countries. Many of the coun-
tries are allies of the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2496 
May 19, 2020 
There is, in fact, an international ef-
fort underway to help pay for that vac-
cine development. Probably the most 
prominent of those efforts is something 
called CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic 
Preparedness Innovations. Curiously, 
though, all of our friends—all of our al-
lies—and some of our adversaries are 
members of that coalition, but the 
United States is not. So, if this coali-
tion were to develop a vaccine and if it 
were to get there before the United 
States, then we wouldn’t have a seat at 
the table to be able to decide where 
that vaccine goes. It is a question as to 
whether we would be able to get it to 
the United States if we are not sitting 
at that table. Why not hedge our bets? 
I hope the dollars that we have pro-
posed here in the U.S. Senate lead to 
the discovery of a vaccine’s happening 
here, but if it doesn’t, why would we 
not also want to be part of a coalition 
like CEPI so that, if it were to discover 
the vaccine first, we would get the ben-
efit of it or, at the very least, we would 
get a say in where it would go. That is 
all the resolution said. Yet we couldn’t 
get it passed. 
This resolution was especially impor-
tant because there is something ex-
traordinary happening right now. It is 
not as if the Trump administration has 
decided that it is not going to go for-
ward with membership in CEPI because 
it is going to lead a different inter-
national coalition. No. In fact, the 
Trump administration is taking a 
giant step back from the world and 
from international organizations just 
at the moment when it is the most nec-
essary for us to be cooperating with 
the rest of the world in finding a vac-
cine or in stamping out this virus. 
Remember, how we stopped Ebola 
from becoming a crisis in the United 
States is by being present in Africa to 
make sure that it didn’t reach our 
shores. The Obama administration un-
derstood that travel bans and walls 
couldn’t stop a virus from entering 
one’s country, so you have to stamp it 
out everywhere in order to be protected 
here. So, just at the moment we need 
to be more engaged with the world, the 
Trump administration is withdrawing 
us from it. 
Witness 
the 
President’s 
unprece-
dented attacks on the WHO. Now, there 
is a stipulation. The WHO is not unlike 
any other major, multinational, inter-
national organization. It has flaws, and 
it has inefficiencies, but there is no 
way you can stand up an international 
coalition to manage the coronavirus or 
prevent the next pandemic without the 
World Health Organization. Color me 
skeptical that the President is sin-
cerely interested in reforming the 
WHO. It seems as if it has been a fairly 
recent interest of the White House. One 
of the ways I can tell that is that we 
have a seat on the governing board of 
the WHO. If we have legitimate griev-
ances over how the WHO is run—and I 
am amongst those who has a laundry 
list of reforms I would like to see at 
the WHO—then the proper way to ex-
press 
those 
grievances 
would 
be 
through our seat on the board of the 
WHO. But do you know what? It has 
been vacant for 3 years. The Trump ad-
ministration hasn’t put anybody on the 
board. It nominated somebody, but 
then Senator MCCONNELL didn’t bring 
him up for a vote. Then his name had 
to be withdrawn, and it took another 10 
months for the Senate to finally put 
somebody on it in the middle of this 
crisis. So we have been absent from the 
WHO for 3 years. 
Now the Trump administration is 
leveling some pretty serious criticisms 
at that organization. Many of them are 
crystallized in a letter that the Presi-
dent released to the world last night. 
What is extraordinary about this letter 
is that it is almost as if the President 
took a letter that detailed his adminis-
tration’s failings with respect to how it 
addressed 
the 
early 
moments 
of 
coronavirus and just substituted in the 
WHO for the Trump administration, be-
cause in this letter to the WHO, it 
reads: ‘‘The World Health Organization 
has repeatedly made claims about the 
coronavirus that were either grossly 
inaccurate or misleading.’’ 
Here is President Trump on January 
22: 
Question: Are there worries about a pan-
demic at this point? 
No, not at all. . . . We have it totally under 
control. It’s one person coming in from 
China, and we have it under control. It’s 
going to be just fine. 
If you want to talk about the leading 
world figure making misstatements 
about 
the 
seriousness 
of 
the 
coronavirus, it is President Donald 
Trump, especially in January and Feb-
ruary, when we could have been getting 
a head start. 
Further in this letter, it reads: 
‘‘[T]he World Health Organization has 
been curiously insistent on praising 
China for its alleged ‘transparency.’ ’’ 
Here is President Donald J. Trump 
on January 24. This isn’t in answer to 
a question. This is just an unsolicited 
remark about China on his Twitter ac-
count. 
He writes: 
China has been working very hard to con-
tain the Coronavirus. The United States 
greatly appreciates their efforts and trans-
parency. It will all work out well. In par-
ticular, on behalf of the American People, I 
want to thank President Xi! 
There was no more enthusiastic 
cheerleader for China and its response 
to the coronavirus in January, Feb-
ruary, and March than our own Presi-
dent. 
If President Trump wants to level 
criticisms at the WHO for being too 
soft on China, he has to look himself in 
the mirror and understand that it 
frankly would have been hard for the 
WHO to stand up and contradict its 
most important donor and patron, the 
United States of America. 
On February 7, the President was 
given this question: 
Are you concerned that China is covering 
up the full extent of coronavirus? 
President Trump’s answer: 
No. China is working very hard. . . . 
They’re working really hard, and I think 
they are doing a very professional job. 
On February 18: 
Mr. President, are you still satisfied with 
how 
President 
Xi 
is 
handling 
the 
coronavirus? 
Answer: I think President Xi is working 
very hard. 
Question: Some people don’t seem to trust 
the data coming from China. Are you wor-
ried about that? 
Trump: Look, I know this: President Xi 
loves the people of China. He loves his coun-
try, and he’s doing a very good job. 
February 26, the question is: 
How can you legitimately trust President 
Xi and the Chinese? 
Well, I can tell you this: I speak to him; I 
had a talk with him recently. And he is 
working so hard on this problem. . . . And 
they’re tough and very smart. 
There is no one who was defending 
China more vociferously in January 
and February than President Trump. It 
came on the heels of his decision to 
pull two-thirds of the CDC scientists 
out of that country, to shutter a pro-
gram that was tracking viruses around 
the world, including China, and now 
the President has compounded that 
error by pulling the United States out 
of the WHO, an imperfect but abso-
lutely necessary body that can be the 
only natural source of convening for a 
fight to stop coronavirus over the 
course of this summer and this fall and 
to prevent the next pandemic. 
This is a moment when we should be 
putting a foot forward into the world 
and leading—and leading. There is no 
wall; there is no travel restriction that 
can stop this virus. Why do we know 
that? Because the President crowed 
about his travel restriction on China, 
and we found out that 400,000 people 
got here from countries subject to the 
ban before and after it was put into ef-
fect. 
He sends out pictures on a regular 
basis of a wall going up with Mexico. 
That didn’t stop this virus from get-
ting here. We need to be present on the 
world stage right now. 
Finally, if the President’s complaint 
is that China and the WHO are too 
close, then by withdrawing from the 
WHO, we are effectively exacerbating 
the problem that the President identi-
fies as one that needs to be solved. 
Why? Because yesterday President Xi 
accepted an invitation to speak before 
the WHO—an invitation that President 
Trump turned down—and he pledged to 
lead the world’s response to the hu-
manitarian 
suffering 
caused 
by 
coronavirus. 
Now, color me skeptical about Chi-
na’s intentions, but the fact is, they 
were on that world stage putting $2 bil-
lion into that effort yesterday, and we 
were nowhere to be found. The greatest 
beneficiary that comes from the United 
States’ stepping back at this moment 
and walking away from the WHO is the 
Chinese Government. I believe that our 
security will be defined by our ability 
to contest efforts by China to grow its

power around the world. We are gifting 
them—gifting them—an advancement 
of their power and influence through 
our refusal to take part in WHO, our 
refusal to lead the effort to reform it, 
and our refusal as called upon in this 
resolution that was objected to earlier 
today offered by Senator DURBIN to be 
part of the global effort to try to find 
a vaccine. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Okla-
homa. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I was 
sitting through the last two speakers 
and listening to them. You can tell 
that it is an election year. The Demo-
crats want to defeat President Trump, 
and I think sometimes a tactic to use 
is to get someone’s strongest point and 
try to turn it into his weakest point. In 
this case, we have heard in just the last 
few minutes that the President is han-
dling 
the 
coronavirus 
completely 
wrong, that he is critical of and then 
he was friendly to—I couldn’t quite fig-
ure out the relationship with China. I 
know the Democrats in this Chamber 
are generally perceived as the close 
friends of China and President Xi and 
the rest of them. 
Also, to talk about what Speaker 
PELOSI has done in terms of the bill 
that was passed in the House and the 
criticism that we are not taking up 
that bill, well, all that bill is—we are 
not supposed to be talking about any-
thing in all of this heavy spending ex-
cept 
doing 
something 
about 
coronavirus. This is something that no 
one had anything to do with. We didn’t 
know it was going to happen. We had 
no preparation for it. I have never ex-
perienced it in my life. Yet I do re-
member so well when this body, this 
Senate, was working on a coronavirus 
bill and we were to be voting on it on 
a Sunday at 6 o’clock in the evening, 
and the Speaker of the House, NANCY 
PELOSI, came dancing in. It was the 
first time I even knew she was in town 
because the House wasn’t in session, 
and she stopped it. She used her influ-
ence to try to stop it and successfully 
did stop it. The vote was taking place 
at 6 p.m. on a Sunday night, and noth-
ing happened except a stall from then 
until 6 p.m. on Thursday night, when 
we finally did vote on it. In the mean-
time, how many days passed? How 
many people died in the meantime? 
Then, when they come up in the 
House and they come up with a bill 
that is supposedly their answer to the 
coronavirus, it has nothing to do with 
coronavirus. It has to do with the very 
liberal Democratic agenda taking ad-
vantage of the fact that this crisis is 
on us in order to use this to try to get 
things passed. I am talking about— 
now, I don’t have any notes down here 
with me. I don’t know whether she is 
using gun control or what other efforts 
they were using in that bill, but it is 
one that has no place in the discussion 
when we are talking about coronavirus. 
The tragedy there, the people dying— 
and to credit this President, I have to 
say, he has done a great job in address-
ing this. He is the one who, every sin-
gle day, is there with top medical peo-
ple and afterward, at the end of the 
day, having a news conference and get-
ting from the public what can we do 
better that we haven’t been doing. He 
has handled it in a very, very effective 
way. But that is not why I am here on 
the floor. 
TRIBUTE TO TOM COBURN 
Madam President, I would like to 
read into the RECORD a speech I made 
here on the Senate floor on December 
11, 2014, about another Senator from 
Oklahoma. I am here with something 
that is very sensitive to me that I want 
to share. 
I wish to make some unscripted comments, 
but sincere and from the heart. I hope I am 
accurate when I say this, that I think in 
some respect I discovered Tom Coburn. I sus-
pect that Tom and I are the only two who 
have ever had a major, high level national 
political discussion in Adair, OK. I remember 
hearing that there was a very conservative 
doctor from Muskogee. I remember calling 
him up at that time and asking him to run 
for the House of Representatives, which he 
did. He kept his commitments and did every-
thing that he was supposed to do. I always 
remember that day. 
As Senator Coburn knows, we have a place 
my wife and I built on a big lake in Okla-
homa back in 1962. 
A lot of people outside of Oklahoma 
don’t realize that Oklahoma has more 
miles of freshwater shoreline than any 
of the 50 States. It is a big lake State. 
She and I built our place way back a 
long time ago. 
When I drive up there, I go through Adair, 
and I go through that little sheltered area 
that is half torn down now. They tore down 
the biggest bank in town. Every time I go by 
there, I have to say I recall meeting for the 
first time with a young doctor named Tom 
Coburn. 
I regret to say that there are times in our 
service together when we have not been in 
agreement on specific issues, and I think we 
have a characteristic in common. I think we 
are both kind of bullheaded, which has cre-
ated some temporary hard feelings, but there 
is one thing that overshadows that. Jesus 
has a family, and His family has a lot of peo-
ple in it. Some are here in this room. Tom 
Coburn and I are brothers. 
In the 20 years I have been here in the Sen-
ate, I don’t believe I heard a speech that was 
as touching and sincere as the speech I heard 
from my junior Senator a [short time] ago. 
I really believe that in spite of all the 
things that have happened—and there were 
some differences, but they were minor—that 
he never ceased to be my brother, and I want 
to ask the Senator right now to forgive me 
for the times I have perhaps said something 
unintentionally that was not always right 
and was not always from the heart. But I 
want my junior Senator to know that I sin-
cerely love him and am going to be hurting 
with him with the troubles he has right now, 
or might have in the future, and will sorely 
miss him in this body. 
I ask that the RECORD show that I sin-
cerely love my brother, Senator Coburn. 
Madam President, that was a speech 
I made on December 11, 2014, and it 
sounded funny because, after the dis-
agreement that we had, he and I were 
talking just a short time ago, and that 
was well after this speech I made in 
2014, and neither one of us could re-
member what issue it was that we dis-
agreed on, but we knew there was one 
there. 
Here is the truth. There was no one 
like Dr. Tom Coburn. There was no one 
like him in Oklahoma. He was a simple 
country doctor from Muskogee. He was 
a family doctor. He delivered thou-
sands of babies in Northeastern Okla-
homa. I told him when he was running 
for the first time: You don’t have any 
problems. All you have to do is get all 
the babies you delivered and have them 
bring their families along, and it will 
be an overwhelming victory. 
There was no one like him. He was a 
true fiscal conservative who stayed 
true to his purposes. He had skills that 
made him arguably the most thought-
ful adviser in the Republican con-
ference. 
I think this is somewhat char-
acteristic of doctors. It is part of their 
culture. They advise people. People lis-
ten to them. And that was Tom. Tom 
was always an adviser to everyone. In 
every policy decision, Tom sought to 
be a faithful steward of the taxpayers’ 
money and a dedicated public servant 
to Oklahoma. 
He had an impressive record of serv-
ice in the House of Representatives, as 
well as serving in the Senate with me, 
but nothing about that legacy would 
have mattered to Tom. Tom knew what 
mattered in life. What mattered in life 
was his family—Carolyn and his three 
daughters. 
Carolyn, I suspect you may probably 
even be watching right now, and I want 
you to know how many people in this 
body—Tom is not here anymore, but 
how many people love you and Tom. 
Tom knew what was important in life 
and in Jesus. He is a brother in the 
Lord. He is my brother. 
He will always be a Member of this 
institution, but we need to make it of-
ficial. 
So, Madam President, in honor of his 
life and legacy, I would like to ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate ap-
prove a resolution in honor of the life 
and legacy of Tom Coburn, a doctor 
from Muskogee.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
President 
Eisenhower 
once 
said: 
‘‘Farming looks mighty easy when 
your plow is a pencil, and you’re a 
thousand miles [away] from the corn 
field.’’ Those are wise words from a 
wise man. 
If you are trying to get a view of 
what is happening across America, you 
certainly can’t get a comprehensive 
picture staying here in Washington, 
DC, or even listening to the national 
media. That is why, whether working 
on a farm bill, a highway bill, or a 
coronavirus recovery bill, I look to my 
constituents for feedback. I know we 
all do the same. 
Since we first learned that evacuees 
from China would be headed to Joint 
Base San Antonio for a 14-day quar-
antine, I have been in close contact 
with the folks in Texas—starting in 
San Antonio—about the coronavirus. I 
have joined dozens, if not 100 or more, 
videoconferences with groups covering 
every industry that have shared honest 
perspectives about how things are 
going, what is working, and what more 
is needed from Congress. 
I have spoken with nurses and hos-
pital administrators about the need for 
additional 
PPE 
to 
protect 
our 
healthcare heroes. I have spoken with 
researchers and scientists, even as re-
cently as today, about the ongoing 
quest to develop vaccines and treat-
ments and, of course, with farmers and 
ranchers and producers about their 
struggle to cope with a glut of supply 
and reduced demand. 
I have spoken with small business 
owners about the impact of this virus 
on their businesses, their workforce, 
and their communities. Their feedback 
has been invaluable to the work of the 
Senate as we continue our mission to 
lead America through and eventually 
out of this crisis. 
As States across the country begin to 
reopen their economies, the light at 
the end of the tunnel is getting a little 
bit brighter, but there is still a whole 
lot of work that needs to be done. Yes-
terday, I spoke with some of my friends 
at Texans for Lawsuit Reform, the 
Texas Civil Justice League, and a num-
ber of other business stakeholders 
about the critical need for liability 
protection 
in 
our 
next 
piece 
of 
coronavirus legislation. 
We are already seeing that, across 
America, there is a wave of COVID–19- 
related lawsuits rolling in. Without ac-
tion on our part, there is genuine fear 
that these lawsuits could hurt the very 
people we need to be helping right now 
get through this weakened economy. 
One of the Texans on the call talked 
about 
the 
vast 
challenges 
our 
healthcare workers have faced over the 
last several weeks. As hospital beds 
began 
filling 
up, 
the 
strain 
on 
healthcare workers became a serious 
problem. 
Many States loosened restrictions to 
allow out-of-State or retired physicians 
to join the fight on the frontlines, and 
countless healthcare workers are being 
cross-trained or redeployed to help fill 
personnel shortages. You may see pedi-
atricians caring for adults or anesthe-
siologists working in the ICU. 
On top of that, these men and women 
are forced to make tough, almost im-
possible decisions every day. They may 
have half a dozen patients who des-
perately need a ventilator but only two 
machines available. 
We should not put our healthcare 
workers in an impossible situation 
where we ask them to do everything 
they can to help, and then we punish 
them by subjecting them to litigation 
when somebody claims that they could 
or should have done better. 
It is not just healthcare workers, 
though, who could emerge from this 
crisis only to be greeted by an ava-
lanche of lawsuits. As our economy be-
gins to reopen, businesses are dusting 
off their tables, barber chairs, gym 
equipment—whatever the case may 
be—and preparing to welcome cus-
tomers back through their doors. 
They are following the guidance from 
the State and the Centers for Disease 
Control and taking every precaution 
they recommend to protect both their 
employees and their customers. How-
ever, despite their best efforts, there is 
nothing stopping someone who con-
tracts the virus from saying it hap-
pened at that particular business and 
then suing. 
One of the people on our call yester-
day said his business has faced many 
lawsuits before, and he knows that, 
even if you have done absolutely noth-
ing wrong, defending these lawsuits 
can be a huge, huge expense. He point-
ed out that causation is of particular 
concern when you talk about a virus. 
We are still learning about it, but we 
know that the incubation period could 
last up to 14 days, making it nearly im-
possible to prove when and where the 
virus was contracted. 
While ordinarily it would be the bur-
den of the person bringing the suit to 
prove causation, we know that, in jury 
trials, anything can happen and that 
this is not enough to stop opportun-
istic litigation from trying to either 
get a successful jury verdict and judg-
ment or just a nuisance settlement be-
cause of the cost of defense. 
Across the country, we are already 
seeing coronavirus lawsuits rolling in, 
targeting not only our healthcare 
workers and businesses but nursing 
homes, assisted living facilities, uni-
versities, governments—you name it. 
Without action from Congress, the 
litigation epidemic will be a big one 
and will add insult to injury from this 
pandemic. We simply cannot allow this 
tidal wave of lawsuits to sweep away 
our healthcare workers, nonprofits, 
and businesses who followed the guide-
lines and acted in good faith. Congress 
needs to put in place commonsense re-
forms to protect those who have helped 
the American people get through this 
crisis and who will help lead us out of 
it. 
I am working with my colleagues on 
a proposal that would achieve this goal 
through temporary and targeted pro-
tections related to COVID–19 lawsuits. 
That includes our healthcare workers 
who have been on the frontlines bat-
tling this pandemic, the businesses 
that are going to great lengths to safe-
ly reopen their doors, and the non-
profits helping their communities dur-
ing a time of unprecedented need. 
Despite what some of the folks on the 
left try to claim, this isn’t a ban on 
lawsuits. Nobody is suggesting we have 
blanket immunity. No one wants to let 
bad actors get away with their bad be-
havior and to reward it. However, as 
my constituents told me yesterday, the 
fear of unrestrained litigation could be 
the boot on the neck of our economy 
and add insult to injury for our 
healthcare workers and others who, in 
good faith, did precisely what they 
were asked to do during this time of 
crisis. 
We need to put commonsense safe-
guards in place to ensure that those op-
erating in good faith and following all 
the relevant guidelines cannot be sued 
into oblivion because of a particular 
outcome when people are doing the 
best they know how to do during a 
time of crisis—in good faith—and doing 
exactly what the public health officials 
and their government officials are tell-
ing them to do. 
This is going to be a critical aspect 
to our recovery, not only in Texas but 
in every State across the Nation. We 
have counted on all of these people, 
from our healthcare workers to local 
businesses, to help get us through this 
crisis. We can’t let them down now. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. CAPITO. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2499 
May 19, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
rise today to address the healthcare 
and economic crisis facing our Nation 
because of COVID–19. According to 
Johns Hopkins University, more than 
1.5 million Americans have tested posi-
tive for COVID and more than 90,000 
have died. And 1,509 West Virginians 
have tested positive for COVID, and 68 
have died, according to our State’s De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices. 
We mourn each one of those lost lives 
and remember the families who grieve 
for them now and the friends who have 
lost a loved one. All of us join together, 
and we thank all of the heroes who are 
on the frontline performing lifesaving 
and life-sustaining jobs during this 
pandemic. 
The economic consequences of this 
pandemic have been devastating as 
well, but the health devastation is 
what really, I think, breaks all of our 
collective hearts. 
On the economic front nationally, 
the unemployment rate is 14.7 percent, 
and 36.5 million Americans have filed 
for unemployment since mid-March— 
an incredible number. 
In our small State of West Virginia, 
164,000 unemployment claims have been 
processed since March, and the unem-
ployment rate is over 15 percent. With 
these terrible facts and the urgency of 
them, it is right for Congress to come 
together to take bold action. 
We have enacted four major pieces of 
bipartisan legislation to help ease this 
crisis. Most significant of those, of 
course, was the CARES Act, which 
passed this body 96 to 0. With bipar-
tisan support, the CARES Act provided 
$100 billion for our hospitals and med-
ical providers to help them respond to 
this crisis. 
Together, we created the Paycheck 
Protection Program—PPP, as every-
body knows it—to save jobs and to 
keep our employers and employees con-
nected but also to save jobs at small 
businesses and help those businesses 
survive. 
As of this past weekend, 15,972 West 
Virginia small businesses had taken 
advantage of the PPP program. 
The CARES Act provided direct relief 
for the American people through pay-
ments of up to $1,200 apiece, and more 
than 780,000 payments totaling $1.3 bil-
lion have been sent to my fellow West 
Virginians. 
The CARES Act increased unemploy-
ment benefits to help meet the needs of 
those workers who lost their jobs due 
to the crisis, and we see the numbers. 
That has been a great benefit. 
It provided significant resources for 
our State and local governments. Our 
State of West Virginia has received 
$1.25 billion to help our State, city, and 
county governments. 
After the CARES Act, despite some 
delays, we came together again and 
passed additional bipartisan legislation 
that provided more funding for the 
PPP program and more resources for 
hospitals, more money for COVID test-
ing. We just sent $57 million to the 
State of West Virginia for more test-
ing. 
In a bipartisan way, Congress re-
sponded to the needs of our medical 
community, as we should. Our small 
businesses, our workers, our families, 
our State and local governments, and 
our heroes are essential workers. As 
our communities begin the process of 
carefully reopening, we know that 
more Federal resources and additional 
legislation will in all likelihood be nec-
essary. We all hope that our economy, 
which only months ago was very 
strong, can rebuild quickly. But our 
small businesses and workers will need 
additional help. There is no question 
that will happen. 
As we face the possibility of a second 
wave of infections later this year, we 
should continue to build our stockpile 
of medical supplies and aid our hos-
pitals. 
I have heard from our Governor, 
county commissioners, and our mayors 
across West Virginia about the lost 
State and local government revenues 
caused by COVID. Allowing the CARES 
Act funds to be used to replace these 
lost revenues will make sure that State 
and local governments can continue to 
meet the public safety and public 
health needs. This is critical. 
I have joined Senator SULLIVAN and 
others in supporting bipartisan legisla-
tion that would do just that. We should 
enact meaningful liability reform to 
protect our hospitals, doctors, busi-
nesses, college, universities, and non-
profits from lawsuit abuse. Those who 
do their best to treat patients, fol-
lowing government guidelines, and pre-
vent the spread of the contagious virus 
should not be held liable when treat-
ments fail or COVID spreads. Unless we 
act, lawsuit abuse could choke off our 
economic recovery. And we should hold 
China—China—accountable for hiding 
the true scope of the COVID pandemic, 
making the global spread of this dis-
ease much worse. 
We should all work on all of these 
priorities going forward. It is appro-
priate that Congress should examine 
the effectiveness of the CARES Act— 
we have been doing that for the last 
several weeks; that is why I am glad we 
are here—as well as the ongoing need 
for resources before considering con-
tinuing new legislation to aid the Na-
tion’s response. But legislation passed 
in response to this crisis should be, as 
has been in the past—should be—bipar-
tisan, and it should be tailored to re-
spond to COVID and the economic 
problems that it has caused. 
Speaker PELOSI’s legislation that 
passed the House of Representatives on 
Friday night fails on both of these 
counts. To the extent there was bipar-
tisanship on Friday night, it came 
from the 14 Democrats who voted 
against the Speaker’s wish list. The 
bill was certainly not tailored to help 
Americans respond to the COVID cases. 
There were things in there that did re-
spond, but there was a whole lot more 
that I will talk about that I think was 
irrelevant. 
Speaker PELOSI’s bill took a massive 
step toward federalizing our elections. 
That is the beauty of our elections. 
They are all different in every single 
State, and our States have the deci-
sions to make. These decisions should 
be made by State and local officials 
and not micromanaged here in Wash-
ington. By the way, I think it makes 
our elections safer that they are not 
federalized. 
The bill prohibits States from requir-
ing a photo ID to vote and requires 
States to allow same-day voter reg-
istration, something we do not do in 
the State of West Virginia. Aside from 
being bad policy, what does that have 
to do with COVID or helping small 
businesses and working families? 
The word ‘‘cannabis,’’ as we might 
have heard already today, appears in 
Speaker PELOSI’s bill 68 times. The bill 
requires a report to make sure that 
women and minorities are able to fully 
participate in the cannabis industry, 
and it makes sure that cannabis busi-
nesses are able to access the banking 
system. By the way, that is an issue 
that has been worked on since I was in 
Financial Services 10 years ago. But 
what does that and how does that re-
late to COVID? 
By allowing stimulus payments to be 
sent to individuals without a verified 
Social 
Security 
number, 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s bill would send taxpayer dol-
lars to illegal immigrants, and the bill 
requires the Department of Homeland 
Security to review the files of every il-
legal immigrant in custody to deter-
mine if he or she should be released. 
Speaker PELOSI also appropriates $50 
million 
for 
environmental 
justice 
grants. It sounds good—environmental 
justice. I am not sure what it has to do 
with COVID, but it sounds good. In re-
ality, a lot of these funds, among other 
things, assist those who are working to 
stop industries that are very critical to 
my State, all the energy industries 
from coal and natural gas. That is ex-
actly the opposite of promoting an eco-
nomic recovery in the State I am from. 
While working families continue to 
struggle, Speaker PELOSI’s bill offers 
significant tax relief for rich taxpayers 
in high tax States. Coincidentally, that 
is not my State; we run our State on a 
balanced budget—and very well. 
Overall, the House bill costs more 
than $3 trillion while doing little to 
help our economy recover and get our 
laid-off workers back on the job. There 
is a bipartisan model out there for 
working together in response to this 
crisis. We have done it four times, as I 
mentioned. But that model is certainly 
not what the House passed last Friday 
night. 
The Senate is continuing to hold 
hearings—we are having them today— 
to learn more about the current crisis 
and provide oversight. More impor-
tantly, we are listening to the people

wants and their fears and their hopes 
and dreams. I am confident that we 
will take responsible action to build 
our economy together, that we will put 
people back to work together, and that 
we will help keep our families safe and 
healthy. Together we can do this. 
Speaker PELOSI’s legislation will not 
become law, and she already knew that

TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE YODER 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I give tribute to a lifelong Iowan 
who has devoted his career in service 
to families who are mourning the loss 
of a loved one. 
From an early age, Charles Yoder 
knew what he wanted to be when he 
grew up. He lived next door to the Pow-
ell Funeral Home in Wellman, IA. That 
is where Charlie’s precocious path to 
his lifelong occupation first started. 
Years later, he graduated from the 
Worsham College of Mortuary Science 
in Illinois. He returned home to Wash-
ington County, where he manages two 
funeral homes in Wellman and Kalona. 
Like many small business people 
across my State, Charlie’s leadership 
reaches deep into the community. His 
civic stewardship reflects a character 
of service to others. He is a member of 
the Rotary Club, Kalona Chamber of 
Commerce, Community Foundation of 
Washington County, and the Dayton 
Lodge. His public service includes time 
spent on the Mid-Prairie Community 
School District Foundation and the 
Kalona Library. 
A member of the National Funeral 
Directors Association, Charlie partici-
pated in its leadership conference here 
in Washington, DC, for the past 3 years. 
Like so many other events, the na-
tional conference this year was can-
celled due to COVID–19. That didn’t 
stop Charlie from stepping up to lead 
and help his profession navigate these 
difficult times. 
For the past 4 years as president- 
elect and president of the Iowa Funeral 
Directors Association, he developed 
strong relationships across its eight 
districts, traveling to each one across 
the State. Networking strengthened 
his efforts to update strategic plans 
and foster continuing education serv-
ices. 
This collaboration also helped Iowa 
funeral directors meet unprecedented 
challenges from the pandemic. Iowans 
are known to celebrate the lives of the 
deceased with large funeral gatherings, 
attended by many people in the com-
munity, who gather to pay their re-
spects and help friends and family 
mourn the loss of a loved one. Obvi-
ously, COVID–19 limited large social 
gatherings, including graduations, wed-
dings, and funerals. 
Charlie developed guidelines to help 
Iowa funeral home directors adapt to 
the public health crisis and continue 
providing safe, compassionate, and per-
sonalized attention to the people and 
communities they serve. 
As caretakers in their respective 
communities, 
Charlie 
did 
not 
let 
COVID–19 redefine their mission to 
serve with professionalism, empathy, 
and integrity. Working with the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention 
and the Iowa Department of Public 
Health, Charlie’s leadership helped en-
sure the public welfare was protected 
and that grieving families and their 
loved ones remained in good hands. 
I thank Charlie for service to his 
community and his vocation. As he 
steps down as president of the Iowa Fu-
neral 
Directors 
Association, 
I 
am 
pleased to learn a member of the next 
generation plans to follow in her dad’s 
footsteps. I congratulate him and his 
wife, Dorie, and wish their daughter 
Morgan all the best as she starts her 
studies and pursues her dream this fall.

S2501 
May 19, 2020 
TRIBUTE TO GLEN TAIT 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH, 
Representative MIKE SIMPSON and Rep-
resentative RUSS FULCHER, I congratu-
late Glen Tait, who is retiring from his 
position as Idaho National Labora-
tory’s—INL—Governmental Affairs Di-
rector, after nearly 20 years with INL. 
Prior to joining INL in 2001, Glen 
served as my legislative director when 
I was first elected to the Senate. Dur-
ing his time guiding my legislative 
staff, he worked on annual appropria-
tions, nuclear, and other energy issues. 
He brought with him significant expe-
rience and understanding of our great 
State of Idaho, as he had previously 
worked as a senior adviser to my prede-
cessor, Dirk Kempthorne. Prior to 
serving on my staff, Glen’s first job in 
Washington, DC, was working for Vice 
President Dan Quayle. He served on the 
Vice President’s national security staff 
as a congressional liaison. 
When announcing Glen’s retirement, 
INL Director Mark Peters recognized 
Glen’s excellent leadership as he has 
worked with our Idaho congressional 
delegation ‘‘throughout the annual ap-
propriations process, securing the par-
ticipation of INL experts in congres-
sional hearings, and working with Con-
gress and federal agencies to advance 
legislation and policies important to 
our energy and national security.’’ 
Glen has been instrumental in helping 
us ensure the allocation of needed re-
sources to INL and assisting with Fed-
eral policy changes to best support nu-
clear innovation. For example, we have 
greatly valued his assistance with the 
2018 enactment of S. 97, the Nuclear 
Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, 
and the 2019 enactments of S. 512, the 
Nuclear Energy Innovation and Mod-
ernization Act, and S. 174, the Securing 
Energy Infrastructure Act. These laws 
are important legacies of Glen’s work, 
as they will ensure the research con-
ducted at INL keeps our Nation at the 
forefront of nuclear innovation. These 
measures are a nice capstone to his 
years of service and dedication to INL 
and nuclear energy, ensuring that re-
search into advanced nuclear reactors 
continues and that research is ulti-
mately able to be commercialized and 
deployed in the private sector. 
Glen is dedicated and talented in 
many aspects of his life beyond his 
work. He speaks Russian, is an avid 
gardener, bikes to work, and runs 
daily. He is a big sports fan, with the 
Washington Nationals and the Cali-
fornia Golden Bears being among his 
favorite teams to watch. Glen is also 
very generous with people and cares 
greatly about helping young people get 
solid footing in Washington, DC. He is 
well regarded for his guidance and 
mentorship, as he has helped new-
comers with job and life skills. He has 
taught many of our staff the ins-and- 
outs of the lab’s research and the 
science behind it. His patience and 
guidance are deeply appreciated by 
many who were fortunate enough to 
work with him. 
Glen, may retirement afford you 
many runs on the beach and great 
times with your loved ones, including 
your wife, Jeannette, and daughters, 
Lindsey Marie and Hailey Madison. 
Congratulations on an outstanding 30- 
year career. We will miss your wit and 
intellect, and thank you for sharing 
your talents with Idahoans all these 
years. We wish you all the best in your 
retirement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING WILLIAM SEALOCK 
∑ Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the distinguished life 
and career of Aliquippa Chief of Police 
Robert William Sealock, who passed 
away on April 11, 2020. 
Chief Sealock dedicated his life in 
service to his community, his Com-
monwealth, and his country. A veteran 
of the U.S. Navy, he later served as a 
police officer in the Borough of Bridge-
water and Crescent and Center Town-
ships, located in Allegheny and Beaver 
counties in western Pennsylvania. At 
the time of his passing, he was the 
chief of police for the city of Aliquippa. 
Beginning as a patrolman and working 
his way up through the ranks of the 
Aliquippa Police Force over a period of 
23 years, he assumed the role of chief of 
police in 2018. Chief Sealock was a 
graduate of Moon Area High School 
and became a member of the Fraternal 
Order of Police James Naim Memorial 
Lodge No. 26 as well as a member of the 
Masonic Lodge No. 672. 
Chief Sealock’s leadership has been 
widely praised by both the public and 
his peers in the law enforcement com-
munity. At a time when his commu-
nity faced a surge in crime and an 
understaffed police force, Chief Sealock 
stepped up to meet the challenge. In 
just a few short years, Chief Sealock 
enhanced the reputation of the police 
department by working tirelessly to re-
build trust and bridge the gap between 
local law enforcement and the commu-
nity it served. He also instituted sev-
eral programs across multiple city of-
fices that were designed to reach Ali-
quippa’s youth and increase participa-
tion in group activities. 
Chief Sealock led by example. He rec-
ognized and understood how important 
it was to police officers to have the 
support of their chief and his hands-on 
approach inspired confidence. As a re-
sult, his fellow officers had tremendous 
respect for his leadership and endear-
ingly referred to him as a ‘‘cop’s cop.’’ 
Tragically, Chief Sealock suffered a 
medical 
emergency 
while 
on 
duty 
which led to his passing. His dedication 
to the Aliquippa Police Department, 
his beloved community, his family, and 
country were guided by a sincere com-
mitment to public service and improv-
ing the lives of people he encountered. 
He will be remembered for his compas-
sion, loving spirit, and warm person-
ality, and his legacy will be felt for 
many years to come. 
I extend my thoughts and prayers to 
his devoted wife, Donna; his daughter 
and son-in-law Taylor Sealock-Smith 
and husband Taner; two stepchildren 
Jonathan Peterson and Stephanie Sny-
der, Leslie Patterson and husband 
Derek Trohaugh; his parents Patricia 
and James Blaha; his sister Colleen 
Sealock; his father and mother-in-law 
William and Dorothy Fontana; and all 
of Chief Sealock’s family and friends as 
they mourn his loss.∑

TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM GODMAN, 
JR. 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want 
to honor a very special North Dakota 
resident who is turning 100 years old on 
May 26. William Godman, Jr., now re-
sides at the Haaland Estates Assisted 
Living Center in Rugby, ND, after liv-
ing on the family farm north of the 
community of Churchs Ferry for 98 and 
a half years. To say this lifelong farm-
er is one of North Dakota’s great stew-
ards of the land would not be an under-
statement. At his father’s urging, he 
did not leave the farm to fight in World 
War II because his brother had en-
listed. He stayed behind to raise the 
food to feed a hungry nation and world 
during those difficult years. On his 
farm, William has raised crops includ-
ing wheat, barley, flax, corn, and 
canola. 
Throughout the decades of his life 
across the past century, William has 
experienced great moments in North 
Dakota’s history. He and his late wife, 
Elaine, raised five children and in-
stilled in them the necessity of hard 
work and self reliance. He gave back to 
his community in many ways, includ-
ing being a longtime 4–H leader, church 
volunteer, and Men’s Club member. Al-
though his birthday will not bring to-
gether as planned all his children, 
grandchildren, 
and 
great-grand-
children, I hope he will be able to cele-
brate this great milestone with friends 
and family at other opportunities 
throughout the year. 
North Dakota is home to more than 
200 centenarians, and we consider them 
among our most treasured residents. 
Their pioneer spirit, dignity, and hard 
work have brought them through many 
challenges and personal achievements. 
On behalf of all North Dakotans, I wish 
William a happy 100th birthday and 
hope this is the start of a year filled 
with happiness and joy.∑

RECOGNIZING NO LIMITS CAFE 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-
try. It is my privilege to recognize a 
small business that not only serves de-
licious food, but provides dignified 
work and promotes inclusivity for indi-
viduals with intellectual disabilities. 
This week, it is my pleasure to honor

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2502 
May 19, 2020 
No Limits Cafe of Middletown, NJ, as 
the Senate Small Business of the Week. 
No Limits Cafe was created to help 
intellectually 
disabled 
individuals 
achieve their full potential. When their 
daughter, Katie, was born with Down 
syndrome, 
founders 
Stephanie 
and 
Mark Cartier began advocating for 
children with intellectual disabilities, 
ID. As Katie neared adulthood, Steph-
anie and Mark were concerned by the 
lack of meaningful employment and 
job training available for people with 
ID. They believed dignified work pro-
vided a sense of pride, purpose, and ful-
filment. Employment was empowering. 
For adults with ID, it could be a life- 
changing opportunity. In 2017, they 
began planning a business that would 
enable adults like Katie to gain valu-
able work skills. 
Over the next 3 years, the Middle-
town community rallied to support 
what would later become No Limits 
Cafe. After the Cartiers bought an old 
restaurant, local businesses and orga-
nizations donated money, materials, 
and labor to transform the building 
into a welcoming and accessible space. 
No Limits Cafe was chartered as a non-
profit 501(c)(3) organization, reflecting 
its commitment to ‘‘do good’’ in their 
community. Stephanie and Mark devel-
oped a two-phase program to fulfill 
their mission of helping adults with ID 
gain working skills and independence. 
First, employ 25–30 adults at the cafe 
with ID. Then, provide restaurant in-
dustry training workshops and place 
trainees within local restaurants. Near 
the end of 2019, more than 30 adults 
with ID were hired as the nonprofit en-
terprise prepared to launch. 
On February 6, 2020, No Limits Cafe 
opened its doors to widespread acclaim. 
In addition to gaining marketable 
skills, employees formed friendships, 
developed independence, and expressed 
a sense of pride in their work. No Lim-
its Cafe was profiled in outlets ranging 
from local news and radio to ABC 
World News Tonight. Their motto of 
‘‘Eat Well—Do Good’’ was clearly re-
flected in their work. 
Like many other nonprofits, No Lim-
its Cafe experienced a sharp decline in 
revenue due to the coronavirus pan-
demic. Without enough money to pay 
their staff, Stephanie and Mark were 
forced to lay off all 36 employees. They 
donated the cafe’s perishable supplies 
to a local food bank, unsure of when 
they could afford to reopen. 
When the U.S. Small Business Ad-
ministration launched the Paycheck 
Protection Program—PPP—Stephanie 
and Mark immediately applied. The 
PPP provides forgivable loans to im-
pacted small businesses and nonprofits 
who maintain their payroll during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. In early May, No 
Limits Cafe received a PPP loan. As a 
result, Stephanie and Mark have been 
able to rehire all 36 of their employees 
and will reopen No Limits Cafe for 
takeout starting Memorial Day week-
end. 
No Limits Cafe is an outstanding ex-
ample of how purpose-driven businesses 
can positively impact their commu-
nities. I commend their efforts to pro-
vide training and employment for 
adults with intellectual disabilities, a 
historically 
underserved 
population. 
Congratulations to Stephanie, Mark, 
and the entire team at No Limits Cafe. 
I look forward to watching your con-
tinued growth and success.∑

Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, Mr. CASEY, and Mr. 
BRAUN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 587 
Whereas diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘DIPG’’) tu-
mors regularly affect 200 to 400 children in 
the United States each year; 
Whereas brain tumors are the leading 
cause of cancer-related death among chil-
dren; 
Whereas, during childhood, DIPG tumors 
are— 
(1) the second most common type of malig-
nant brain tumor; and 
(2) the leading cause of pediatric brain can-
cer deaths; 
Whereas, with respect to a child who is di-
agnosed with a DIPG tumor and receives 
treatment for a DIPG tumor, the median 
amount of time that the child survives after 
diagnosis is only 9 months; 
Whereas, with respect to an individual who 
is diagnosed with a DIPG tumor, the rate of 
survival 5 years after diagnosis is approxi-
mately 2 percent; 
Whereas the average age at which a child 
is diagnosed with a DIPG tumor is between 5 
and 9 years, resulting in a life expectancy ap-
proximately 70 years shorter than the aver-
age life expectancy in the United States; and 
Whereas the prognosis for children diag-
nosed with DIPG tumors has not improved 
over the past 40 years: Now, therefore, be it

AS 
‘‘ALS 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. BRAUN (for himself, Mr. COONS, 
Mr. COTTON, Mr. BENNET, Ms. MCSALLY, 
Mr. DURBIN, Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr. JONES, 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. 
PETERS, Ms. SINEMA, Mr. VAN HOLLEN,

of South 
Carolina, Mr. SCHUMER, Ms. ROSEN, Mr. 
CRAMER, Ms. HARRIS, Mr. LANKFORD, 
Mr. MARKEY, Ms. CANTWELL, and Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 588 
Whereas amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘ALS’’) is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disease that 
affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal 
cord; 
Whereas the life expectancy for an indi-
vidual with ALS is between 2 and 5 years 
after the date on which the individual re-
ceives an ALS diagnosis; 
Whereas ALS occurs throughout the world 
with no racial, ethnic, gender, or socio-
economic boundaries; 
Whereas the 2 different types of ALS are 
sporadic ALS and familial ALS; 
Whereas sporadic ALS— 
(1) is the most common form of motor neu-
ron disease in the United States; 
(2) accounts for between 90 and 95 percent 
of all cases of ALS in the United States; and 
(3) may affect any individual in any loca-
tion; 
Whereas familial ALS (commonly known 
as ‘‘FALS’’)— 
(1) is inherited; and 
(2) accounts for between 5 and 10 percent of 
all cases of ALS in the United States; 
Whereas there is a 50 percent chance that 
each offspring of an individual with familial 
ALS will inherit the gene mutation for fa-
milial ALS and develop the disease; 
Whereas, on average, the period between 
the date on which an individual first experi-
ences symptoms of ALS and the date on 
which the individual is diagnosed with ALS 
is about 1 year; 
Whereas the onset of ALS often involves 
muscle weakness or stiffness, and the pro-
gression of ALS results in the further weak-
ening, wasting, and paralysis of— 
(1) the muscles of the limbs and trunk; and 
(2) the muscles that control vital func-
tions, such as speech, swallowing, and 
breathing; 
Whereas ALS can strike individuals of any 
age but predominantly strikes adults; 
Whereas it is estimated that tens of thou-
sands of individuals in the United States 
have ALS at any given time; 
Whereas, based on studies of the popu-
lation of the United States, slightly more 
than 5,600 individuals in the United States 
are diagnosed with ALS each year, and 15 in-
dividuals in the United States are diagnosed 
with ALS each day; 
Whereas, between 2015 and 2040, the number 
of ALS cases around the world is expected to 
increase nearly 70 percent; 
Whereas the majority of individuals with 
ALS die of respiratory failure; 
Whereas military veterans are approxi-
mately twice as likely to be diagnosed with 
ALS than the general public in the United 
States; 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of 
this resolution, there is no cure for ALS; 
Whereas the spouses, children, and family 
members of individuals living with ALS pro-
vide support to those individuals with love, 
day-to-day care, and more; and 
Whereas an individual with ALS, and the 
caregivers of such an individual, can be re-
quired to bear significant costs for medical 
care, equipment, and home health care serv-
ices for the individual as the disease pro-
gresses: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 2020 as ‘‘ALS Awareness 
Month’’; 
(2) affirms the dedication of the Senate to 
working toward securing cures and better 
treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(referred to in this resolution as ‘‘ALS’’) as 
soon as possible;

May 19, 2020 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
WILLIAM P. BOWES, SR. 
HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
wish to take this opportunity to mark the pass-
ing of a former constituent, William P. (‘‘Bill’’) 
Bowes, Sr., who dedicated much of his life to 
bettering his community and future genera-
tions in the North Shore/North Channel area of 
Houston, TX. Bill resided in his later years in 
Mont Belvieu, TX—but his contributions to the 
North Shore/North Channel area, where he 
spent much of his life, were truly inspiring. I 
want to take a moment to remember his ex-
traordinary record of community service, even 
as we mourn his passing on March 28. 
Bill was a proud graduate of the U.S. Mer-
chant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY. He 
may have been born in Des Moines, IA—but, 
as we say in Texas—he became a Texan as 
quickly as possible. Along with his beloved 
wife, Barbara, Bill moved to Houston in the 
late 1960s to work for a cargo surveying busi-
ness, which grew with the growth of the Port 
of Houston. He raised a family and dedicated 
what extra time he had to serving his commu-
nity. Bill’s obituary, which follows, explains the 
impact he had on his community—my con-
stituency. That impact was, in a word, extraor-
dinary. 
Few people have had a more positive effect 
on the North Shore/North Channel area than 
Bill Bowes. His work with the North Shore Ro-
tary Club, of which he served as president at 
the age of 81 years young, benefited a mul-
titude of local, national and international chari-
table organizations. For decades, working with 
two Members of Congress, Bill helped select 
the most deserving young men and women in 
the Houston area for nomination to the na-
tion’s service academies, including his beloved 
U.S. 
Merchant 
Marine 
Academy—helping 
them obtain an outstanding education while 
serving and protecting our country. In his later 
years, after moving to Mont Belvieu, he served 
on that town’s Planning and Zoning Commis-
sion. 
All of that is encapsulated in the obituary 
that follows. One characteristic of Bill’s that his 
obituary doesn’t fully convey is his modesty. If 
you met Bill once, you were an instant 
friend—and you were a friend forever. But, if 
you met him just once, you’d never know the 
depth of his compassion; you’d never know 
how much time he devoted to his community; 
and you’d never know just how much he loved 
his family. That was because of his modesty 
and humility. But ask anyone else, anyone 
who knew him, and they would tell you how 
much he’d done for others and how enor-
mously proud he was of his family. Not all 
lions feel the need to roar. 
Madam Speaker, today, we ask ourselves 
how, and if, our nation will overcome the 
daunting challenges we face. We have no 
doubt, most of us, that we will persevere and 
overcome—building a better life for future gen-
erations. But we ask who will give us the lead-
ership and inspiration going forward. I suggest 
that the example of Bill Bowes shows us that 
each one of us—and all of us, together—can 
work to overcome the challenges that confront 
us. Bill’s example shows us that one indi-
vidual, with an unwavering commitment to 
helping others, can improve a community and 
make life better today and for generations to 
come. 
To Bill’s family, most especially his loving 
children, Bill Jr., Suzie and Tom, and their 
spouses and their children—to Bill’s many 
friends throughout the Houston area—to those 
who benefited from his charitable activities 
and community service wherever they may 
be—let me offer my heartfelt sympathy on 
your loss. While we mourn his passing, we 
know that what he did when he was with us 
made a difference for the better in the lives of 
countless others. And that provides us with 
some measure of comfort. 
With that, Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD this moving and eloquent profile of 
William P. Bowes, Sr. 
[From the Houston Chronicle, April 12, 2020] 
William P. (‘‘Bill’’) Bowes, Sr. passed away 
on March 28th at the age of 82 years after an 
unexpected, but heroic, hospital-bound, 3- 
week fight for his life. 
From the beginning of his life in Des 
Moines, Iowa to his premature end, Bill was 
known for his work ethic, integrity, ability 
to make friends, ability to lead and undying 
commitment to the mottos of his life—‘‘serv-
ice over self’ and Acta Non Verba (‘‘actions, 
not words’’). An ‘‘army brat’’ son of one of 
General 
MacArthur’s 
commanders, 
Bill 
moved frequently in his youth. Despite these 
moves, he was always able to make fast 
friends with his new classmates, as evidenced 
by his election as high school Class Presi-
dent in the final of 3 high schools he at-
tended. 
After high school, Bill earned a Congres-
sional appointment to the U.S. Merchant 
Marine Academy (Kings Point), where he 
spent his junior year touring the world by 
sea and graduated with a Bachelor of Science 
degree, a U.S. Coast Guard license as Third 
Mate, and a Naval Reserve commission as 
Ensign. A chance weekend invitation for a 
home-cooked meal from one of Bill’s class-
mates resulted in Bill meeting that class-
mate’s sister and Bill’s future wife, Barbara, 
who became the love of his life. Bill liked to 
joke that he ended up paying for that ‘‘free 
meal’’ from his future in-laws the rest of his 
life. Bill and Barbara were married in the 
chapel at Kings Point. His hard work, finan-
cial support and charitable efforts on behalf 
of Kings Point earned Bill many accolades 
and awards, including the Alumni Associa-
tion’s Distinguished Service Award, Out-
standing Personal Achievement Award and 
the Daniel E. Meehan Humanitarian Service 
Award, as well as having a classroom named 
in his and a classmate friend’s honor. 
Soon after his arrival in Houston in the 
late ’60s, Bill left an indelible mark on the 
North Shore community through his leader-
ship of and fundraising for the North Shore 
YMCA, his role as President of the North 
Shore Civic Association, his involvement 
with the North Channel Chamber of Com-
merce & Elks Club and, most notably, his in-
volvement with the North Shore Rotary 
Club, whose members he viewed as his broth-
ers and sisters. 
Bill put his Kings Point experience and 
education to work as a ship and cargo sur-
veyor—first in Manhattan and ultimately in 
Houston. In normal fashion, Bill earned the 
trust and admiration of the owner of the 
company that brought Bill to Texas and who 
eventually sold the company to Bill, Capt. 
Ira S. Derrick. Bill grew the company to 
have satellite offices in Fort Lauderdale, 
New Orleans and Chicago. Hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars of ship and rail borne cargo 
was inspected by Bill’s company. Bill’s pro-
fessional 
reputation 
earned 
him 
many 
unique opportunities, including overseeing 
the packing for transport of a multi-million- 
dollar suit of ancient armor that was on dis-
play at Neiman Marcus, but the most cher-
ished part of Bill’s career was being mentor 
and a second father and friend to many of his 
employees over the years. 
Bill had a more active charitable and so-
cial calendar than most people half his age. 
Literally until the day he was hospitalized, 
he remained active in his community, in-
cluding with the North Shore Rotary Club, 
serving as the club’s President last year at 
81, a marshal at Eagle Pointe Golf Course, a 
board member on North Channel Water Dis-
trict, a member of the Scottish Rite (32° 
Master Mason), a board member on Mont 
Belvieu’s Planning and Zoning Commission 
and a board member of the Kings Point 
Alumni Association. Bill’s almost 42 years of 
Rotarian work earned him many honors, in-
cluding that of ‘‘Major Donor’’ with Rotary 
International. He frequently traveled to 
Mexico to work with his sister Rotary Club 
there. He also loved to host that Club’s mem-
bers at his home when they came to Texas. 
Bill was most proud of his efforts to help 
grow a faith-based clergy certification pro-
gram in prisons, which resulted in a material 
decrease in prison violence and recidivism 
rates. Bill was also an inactive Lieutenant in 
the Navy Reserves. 
Bill’s greatest joy was family and friends. 
Bill’s strongest advocate and most sarcastic 
life partner was his wife of over 43 years, 
Barbara. Bill was Barbara’s biggest sup-
porter as she pursued her law enforcement li-
cense, real estate license and an almost 20– 
year career working for Houston area Con-
gressmen (Jack Fields and Gene Green). Bill 
participated in that Congressional relation-
ship by serving many years as Chair of Con-
gressman Field’s Service Academy Nomina-
tion Board, responsible for recommending 
young men and women for limited appoint-
ments to the various U.S. military and mari-
time academies, including Kings Point. After 
a 5–year battle against Stage 4 melanoma— 
a diagnosis that had given her just 2 months 
to live—Bill said goodbye to the love of his 
life. His life was never the same after Bar-
bara’s death, but he never let the depth of 
his despair impact his continued contribu-
tions to his community or their family. 
After Barbara’s death, Bill—aka Papa and 
Dad—continued to be a mainstay at family 
functions, whether holidays, birthdays, fam-
ily trips to his ranch or spontaneous family 
dinners, and he rarely missed his grandkids’ 
many activities. He also loved to travel the 
world to see family and friends.

May 19, 2020 
In the last few years, one of Bill’s favorite 
family activities was spending time at his 
ranch in Central Texas, where he was 
irremovable from his mower and tractor 
when he wasn’t deer, hog and turkey watch-
ing or playing card games, dominoes and 
corn-hole with his family and friends. 
In addition to Barbara, Bill was preceded 
in death by his parents, Judge John G. and 
Margaret Bowes; his brothers, Jimmy, John 
and Harry; his niece Anne Bowes; his nephew 
Doug Williamsen; and numerous other be-
loved family members and friends. 
Bill is survived by a lifetime of friends too 
numerous to recount; citizens of the east 
Harris County and Chambers County com-
munities who have benefited from his love, 
devotion and charity for over 50 years; dear 
family friends and travelling companions, 
Bryan Wirwicz and Diane Tom; his thought-
ful, loving neighbors; and, most cherished of 
all, his family: 
Children: William P. (‘‘Bill’’) Bowes, Jr. 
and daughter in law Trisha; Suzie Wilburn 
and son in law Mark (‘‘Bo’’); Tom Bowes and 
daughter in law Monica; and daughter in law 
Debra Bowes. 
His beloved grandkids: Kelsey; Will; Haley; 
Bryan; Caitlyn; Ross; Mackenzie; and Kath-
leen. 
Brothers and Sisters in Law: Barbara 
Bishop and husband Ed; Charles (‘‘Chuck’’) 
and Paula Williamsen; Dana Bowes; and 
Carolyn Van Doren. 
Nieces and Nephews: Dennis Harper and 
wife Shelly; John and wife Gina; Lisa Young 
and husband Steve; Bob and wife Debbie; Jim 
and wife Karen; Kristy Rigot and husband 
Jeff; Margaret and husband Richard; and 
each of their children. 
Cousins: Marti; and Bob and wife Linda 
and their children. 
Bill is gone, but he will live on in the 
hearts and memories of those he touched 
during a life well lived. 
A celebration of Bill’s life will be held at a 
later date. Friends of Bill wishing to make a 
memorial contribution in Bill’s name are 
asked to consider either: USMMA Alumni

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
ELLIOTT 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of John Elliott, of Fairview Park, 
Ohio, who passed away Friday, March 20, 
2020 at the age of 83. 
Mr. Elliott spent his career in law enforce-
ment protecting the people of Northern Ohio. 
He played a key role at the height of Cleve-
land’s mob wars, and even helped start the 
U.S. Marshal’s witness protection program in 
Northern Ohio in the early 1970s. 
John Elliott bravely served in the U.S. Navy 
from 1954 to 1958 and as a Cuyahoga County 
sheriff’s deputy until 1967. From there, he 
spent 23 years as a Deputy U.S. Marshal. It 
was in this role where John earned his tough 
reputation by providing protection to families of 
those who testified against organized crime. 
He also took part in numerous mob investiga-
tions, including into the infamous mobster 
Danny Greene. 
His colleagues could not speak highly 
enough of Mr. Elliott’s bravery, integrity, and 
reliability. As one former police chief put it, ‘‘he 
was one helluva good cop.’’ Following retire-
ment in 1990, John remained close to law en-
forcement while serving in the Cleveland po-
lice’s Pipes and Drums Band. 
John Elliott was the beloved husband of the 
late Clorinda (nee Calandrella) for 57 years; 
loving father of Peter, Thomas, Catherine and 
Patrick; grandfather of 12; great grandfather of 
6; and brother of James. 
I salute Mr. Elliot for his dedicated service to 
Northern Ohio. My deepest condolences go 
out to John’s family and all those whose lives 
he touched, especially his son Peter, who fol-
lowed in his footsteps into the U.S. Marshals 
Service. I thank John for his tireless work.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
WILLIAM GATES 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Dr. 
William Gates, a pillar of his community and a 
shining example of the brilliant minds that en-
sure the greatness of our state. A talented 
urologist, leader in his field, artist, and philan-
thropist, the people of Mississippi will certainly 
feel the loss of Dr. Gates. 
Dr. Gates knew from a young age of his 
ambition to become a doctor. In high school, 
he was mentored by a local urologist. Dr. 
Gates was never short of talents and interests. 
He played the piano, guitar, and saxophone 
while being an active sportsman. He was 
awarded the rank of Eagle Scout and contin-
ued to be engaged with the Boy Scouts of 
America. He attended Vanderbilt University 
and was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order. 
After completing his residencies, Dr. Gates 
served our country in the Alabama National 
Guard as a flight surgeon. He consistently in-
vested in the Columbus and Starkville medical 
community and retired in 2005 after 36 years 
in private practice. He was awarded numerous 
titles both for his medical and civic leadership. 
Dr. Gates epitomizes an enduring commit-
ment to the health and livelihood of his com-
munity. I truly admire Dr. Gates’s philanthropic 
efforts as well as his contributions to the prac-
tice of medicine in Mississippi. He will be 
missed as a friend, father, and husband, but 
his impact on Mississippi is immeasurable.

INDIA IS VOCAL FOR LOCAL 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I was grateful to read in The Wall 
Street Journal (May 13) that Indian Prime Min-
ister Narendra Modi in a nationally televised 
speech pledged to boost economic self-suffi-
ciency amid the Wuhan Virus pandemic. 
With 1.3 billion people locked down since 
March 25th the country has suffered historic 
job losses as nonessential industries have 
been completely shut down. Prime Minister 
Modi is inspiring the people of India with the 
slogan ‘‘Lets be vocal for local’’. 
America is fortunate to have such an incred-
ible leader of the Indo-Pacific. I was present 
firsthand several years ago with Ambassador 
Nikki Haley to welcome the Prime Minister to 
the Center Ring of Madison Square Garden in 
New York City. Last year I was present at the 
historic Red Fort in New Delhi for the Prime 
Minister’s Independence Day address, and 
later in Houston with President Donald Trump 
for the Howdy Modi event with over 50,000 at-
tending in the largest welcoming celebration 
for a foreign head of state in the history of the 
United States. 
I am confident with the obvious warm rela-
tionship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and 
President Donald Trump that the families of 
India and America will prevail over the Wuhan 
Virus. 
Now more than ever India, the world’s larg-
est democracy will partner with America, the 
world’s oldest democracy for mutual prosperity 
of creating jobs. With the dedicated leadership 
of President Kavee Kumar of the Indian Amer-
ican Chamber of Commerce there can be a 
replication of one of capitalism’s most phe-
nomenal successes. Indian Americans de-
velop over half the hotels, motels, and hospi-
tality centers across America with the leader-
ship of AAHOA led by President Cecil Staton 
and Vice President Chirag Shah.

LUTIONS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on 
the tribal provisions included in H.R. 6800, the 
HEROS Act. I profusely disagree with this par-
tisan legislation that was crafted by the major-
ity behind closed doors, and with no input 
from the minority, however this legislation pro-
vides critical relief to Indian Country that must 
be noted. In the previous, bipartisan, and ne-
gotiated relief package, the CARES Act, Con-
gress provided tribal governments with record 
breaking appropriations. The HEROS Act con-
tinues to build on what already has been fund-
ed with even more critical dollars and flexi-
bility. Specifically, this bill appropriates $20 bil-
lion to the tribal government stabilization 
fund—money dedicated to tribal governments 
to offset the dramatic losses they are facing at 
this time. This funding would be used to help 
them continue to do the right thing and keep 
their employees on the job—paid, and sup-
ported—as our nation responds to, and recov-
ers from the pandemic. 
I would like to commend the Trump Admin-
istration for its active engagement in finding 
equitable solutions that meet the needs of all 
tribes. To date, the Administration has focused 
on ensuring that tribes have maximum flexi-
bility to determine how they can best use the 
funds to respond to the needs of their citizens 
in this crisis. I applaud those efforts and urge 
the Administration to continue to provide tribal 
governments with the flexibility they need. 
While I oppose this bill, I look forward to 
working with my colleagues on crafting a rea-
sonable and appropriate response to the 
COVID–19 pandemic and I am encouraged 
that tribal governments and communities will 
not be an afterthought, but deliberately in-
cluded in the final legislation.

TRIBUTE TO THE ARMSTEAD 
FAMILY 
HON. JOHN R. MOOLENAAR 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the Armstead Family to 
commemorate their service and contributions 
to Michigan and the United States of America. 
As residents of Michigan, Peter Armstead, 
Earl Armstead, and Robert Armstead all an-
swered the call to serve and stood ready to 
pay the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. Their 
strength and courage will be marked by their 
burial in the Great Lakes National Cemetery, 
resting peacefully side-by-side. Their family 
has paid a great tribute to this country and 
they will be commemorated with this es-
teemed and well-deserved honor. 
With a long family history dating back to the 
1800s, Peter, Earl and Robert represent three 
generations of Armstead Family patriotism and 
dedication to serving on the front lines with the 
United States Military. Having served in three 
significant wars in American history—Peter as 
a Civil War Veteran, Earl as a World War I 
Veteran, and Robert Armstead as a World 
War II Veteran—the Armsteads have dis-
played enduring selflessness and tremendous 
sacrifice. 
This exemplary service and unprecedented 
legacy has earned the Armstead family the es-
teemed honor of having Peter, Earl, and Rob-
ert buried with full military honors. On behalf 
of the Fourth Congressional District of Michi-
gan, I am honored today to recognize the 
Armstead Family and extend my highest ap-
preciation for their sacrifice and commitment 
to Michigan and the United States of America.

HONORING THE LIFE OF KEITH 
COLE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in celebration of the life of Trooper 
Keith Cole who passed away last week after 
a courageous battle with cancer. Keith Cole 
was dedicated to his family, career, and com-
munity, and was a proud protector of the peo-
ple of Lee County. I thank Mr. Cole for his 
commitment to the people of Mississippi, and 
for being a symbol of honor and integrity 
throughout his life. 
Keith Cole was an active member of the 
Tupelo community. Graduating from Mooreville 
High School before attending Itawamba Com-
munity College, Mr. Cole pursued his lifelong 
dream of a career in law enforcement. He 
graduated from the Tupelo Police Academy 
and served as a Mississippi Highway Patrol 
Officer. Mr. Cole was dedicated to serving the 
people of Mississippi, but he was an ever- 
present husband and father to his wife of 17 
years, Monica Jenkins Cole and his son Mi-
chael. He leaves behind a loving family who 
will carry on his memory. 
Trooper Cole was a valiant officer of the 
law, a loving husband and father, and a pillar 
of his community. While we mourn his loss 
and honor his memory, we recognize that his 
impact on Lee County has been immeas-
urable. I wish my sincerest condolences to the 
family and friends of Trooper Cole.

WUHAN VIRUS CORRECTLY NAMED 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as the grateful son of a World War 
II Flying Tiger of the U.S. Army Air Corps who 
served in China, I grew up with appreciation 
for the people of the people of Xian, Chungdu, 
and Kunming where he lived served. First 
Lieutenant Hugh deV. Wilson educated me on 
the bravery of the Chinese people to resist ag-
gression with an extraordinary cultural herit-
age. It is because of my devotion to the peo-
ple of China that I believe the proper identi-
fication of the deadly threat to all nations of 
the world is The Wuhan Virus.

RECOGNIZING MICHAEL WARRICK 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and congratulate my 
friend—Michael Warrick, who was recently 
named the 2020 Arkansas Living Treasure by 
the Arkansas Arts Council. 
The Arkansas Arts Council Living Treasure 
award was created in 2002 and recognizes an 
Arkansas artist who excels in the creation of 
a traditional craft and who actively preserves 
and advances their craft through community 
outreach and educating others. 
That certainly describes Michael, who has 
taught sculpture at the University of Arkansas 
at Little Rock for three decades. 
He grew up in a small town outside of Chi-
cago and his interest in sculpting and the arts 
was evident from a young age. He earned his 
undergraduate degree in ceramics and mas-
ter’s degree in fine arts. 
He is known to have a profound impact on 
many of his students, several becoming suc-
cessful artists in their own right.

HONORING THE NURSES OF PARK-
LAND HEALTH & HOSPITAL SYS-
TEM IN DALLAS, TEXAS 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and honor the nurses 
of Parkland Health & Hospital System in Dal-
las, Texas, for their commitment to serving 
their patients and our community during this 
novel coronavirus pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, the sacrifices that the 
nurses fighting COVID–19 have been im-
mense. At Parkland Memorial Hospital, over 
300 medical staffers are caring for coronavirus 
patients in the Tactical Care Unit. One of 
these nurses has moved into an RV and has 
not seen her 7-month-old daughter in more 
than five weeks. Another has only had contact 
with her 2-year-old when she wore an N95 
mask and gloves for a birthday hug. A third, 
who lives alone, has volunteered for every 
shift she can get to nurse the most critically ill 
COVID–19 victims. 
As the first registered nurse elected to Con-
gress, I am deeply aware of the sacrifices and 
expertise that medical professionals bring to 
their work, and I honor their selfless, dedi-
cated service during this public health crisis. 
What our society is asking of them, the sup-
port staff, and all their families is immense, 
and we must endeavor to provide absolutely 
every possible resource for their work. This 
means that the current nationwide struggles to 
acquire personal protective equipment and 
testing materials are unacceptable, and I am 
committed to pushing for all our essential 
medical professionals to be properly equipped 
to provide the care our communities need and 
depend on at this time. 
Madam Speaker, the contributions of the 
medical professionals serving in the city of 
Dallas, state of Texas, these United States, 
and across the globe are truly immeasurable. 
Therefore, on behalf of the U.S. House of 
Representatives and Texas’ 30th Congres-
sional District, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in recognizing and honoring the sacrifices 
and commitment of these essential medical 
staffers 
during 
this 
unprecedented 
novel 
coronavirus pandemic.’’

HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RECOV-
ERY OMNIBUS EMERGENCY SO-
LUTIONS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 6800, the Health and Economic 
Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HE-
ROES) Act. Our nation is experiencing un-
precedented job loss as our communities deal 
with a global health pandemic that is respon-
sible for the deaths of more than 85,000 indi-
viduals in our country in just the past few 
months. We cannot wait another day, another 
week, or another month to take action. Our 
communities need help now and they are 
looking to Congress to lead. I’m grateful for 
the leadership of the House of Representa-
tives, Speaker PELOSI, and our committee 
chairs and staff for working with us to put to-
gether an ambitious bill that will send needed 
help to individuals and families in the form of 
an additional direct stimulus payment; to our 
state and local governments, which are experi-
encing extreme budget shortfalls; and to our 
small businesses that are the backbone of our 
local economies and the heart of our commu-
nities. Although I am disappointed that the bill 
does not include several provisions including 
ongoing payments for individuals and families, 
additional funding to support child care, and a 
strong investment in our workforce systems, 
among other things, I will support this step for-
ward. 
We heard loud and clear from our state and 
local governments—they need more support 
to keep our communities safe. This bill in-
cludes $915 billion in emergency funding to 
state and local governments, funding that can 
be used to help prevent teacher job loss and 
funding cuts to education and, importantly, the 
bill expands the use of funds to cover lost, de-
layed, or decreased revenue from the public 
health emergency. The HEROES Act also in-
cludes $90 billion for the State Fiscal Sta-
bilization Fund that can be used to provide 
emergency support to students—including 
Dreamers, who were previously excluded from 
receiving emergency grants—schools, and in-
stitutions of higher education. These funds are 
critical to supporting public colleges and uni-
versities, addressing student mental health 
needs, and purchasing technology and mobile 
hotspots to support distance learning. Under 
this proposal, my home state of Oregon would 
receive approximately $980 million. 
During this public health crisis, no one 
should have to choose between affording 
basic needs or making payments on their stu-
dent loans. The CARES Act suspended invol-
untary collection like wage garnishment or re-
duction of Social Security payments for delin-
quent federally-owned student loans. The HE-
ROES Act follows my recommendation to ex-
tend these protections to all borrowers, includ-
ing those who have privately held student 
loans. 
Building on my earlier efforts to make sure 
K12 students can access school meals during 
school closures, this legislation funds school 
meal and child and adult care food programs 
with emergency relief that will help schools 
continue to meet the needs of children and 
their families. This bill will further help families 
access nutritious meals by increasing the 
SNAP benefit level by 15 percent. 
I am grateful that this bill provides $7 billion 
for child care, but this is far from the invest-
ment that is needed to support families, pro-
viders, and the child care workforce at this 
critical time. I will continue to fight for signifi-
cant, additional funding in future relief pack-
ages. If child care is not available and afford-
able, families will not be able to return to work. 
Additionally, I will continue to fight for addi-
tional funding for the Community Services 
Block Grant program to support the vital anti- 
poverty work of the more than 1,000 Commu-
nity Action agencies across this country. 
We cannot overcome this virus until we 
drastically increase our public health efforts. 
The HEROES Act provides crucial funding to 
conduct national testing, implement a contact 
tracing and surveillance strategy, and allow all 
Americans to seek treatment for COVID–19 
without worrying about the cost. The bill also 
increases support for our frontline health care 
providers, invests in public health infrastruc-
ture, and expands access to health coverage 
whether 
employer-provided, 
publicly 
sup-
ported, or on the open market. The HEROES 
Act also provides key resources to older 
adults and people with disabilities. The bill 
provides an additional $85 million in funding 
for Older Americans Act (OAA) programs that 
were reauthorized earlier this year by legisla-
tion I was proud to lead. This means more re-
sources for supportive services, nutrition pro-
grams, assistive technology, and elder rights 
protection activities. 
The direct payments to individuals in the 
CARES Act was an important first step, but I 
know that too many people in Northwest Or-
egon and across the country need more sup-
port during this health and economic crisis. Al-
though this bill does not provide at least 
$2,000 per month for individuals through the 
duration of the pandemic, which I advocated 
for, it does provide a second stimulus payment 
of $1200 to most individuals and, importantly, 
it retroactively fixes a problem in CARES and 
will now extend direct payments to individuals 
filing with Individual Taxpayer Identification 
Numbers. 
More than 396,000 Oregonians have filed 
for unemployment insurance in the last two 
months. I know how important this support is 
during the pandemic, and I’m working in Con-
gress to strengthen and expedite access to 
these benefits. The HEROES Act expands the 
additional $600 in federal benefits added to 
every weekly unemployment compensation 
check through January 2021, and it extends 
eligibility for self-employed individuals, gig 
economy workers, and independent contrac-
tors. This vital economic support must con-
tinue until workers can safely get back on the 
job. Also it is truly unfortunate that, despite the 
merits of a more comprehensive approach, the 
HEROES Act does not include the Paycheck 
Guarantee Act, legislation spearheaded by 
Congresswoman PRAMILA JAYAPAL. The Pay-
check Guarantee Act would allow most individ-
uals to stay on payroll during this national 
emergency and keep their benefits, and it 
would also significantly reduce the number of 
people filing for Unemployment Insurance. I 
will continue to advocate for creative ap-
proaches like the Paycheck Guarantee Act 
that maximize the benefits to workers and the 
economy while also reducing bureaucracy. 
We need to do more to protect workers from 
hazardous conditions on the job, and I will 
keep fighting for workplace protections and 
personal protective equipment for all workers 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. I am an origi-
nal cosponsor of the COVID–19 Every Worker 
Protection Act, and I’m pleased that it is in-
cluded in the HEROES Act with additional 
funding for the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration. Protecting essential 
workers during the pandemic is one of my top 
priorities. I have also advocated for premium 
pay for essential workers to recognize their 
role in sustaining our communities and the 
sacrifices they are making during the pan-
demic. The HEROES Act will provide frontline

workers who are in contact with patients, the 
public, or co-workers—including grocery store 
workers, health care workers, and first re-
sponders—with an additional $13 per hour in 
premium pay on top of regular wages, up to 
$10,000. 
As more communities start to lift stay-at- 
home orders, all workers need access to paid 
family, medical, and sick leave benefits. The 
HEROES Act will help expand access to 
emergency paid sick leave and emergency 
paid family and medical leave by eliminating 
exemptions for health care workers, first re-
sponders, workers at businesses with fewer 
than 50 employees, and workers at busi-
nesses with 500 or more employees. And I will 
keep working with my colleagues to secure 
permanent paid sick leave and paid family and 
medical leave for all workers. 
I started working at Legal Aid while I at-
tended community college, and learned there 
that people do not struggle by choice. With 
our national economy upended, consumers 
face even greater financial hardships and 
predatory actors continue to take advantage of 
people facing this crisis. We should have im-
plemented the strengthened consumer protec-
tions in the HEROES Act at the beginning of 
this crisis, and I have continued calls for their 
passage. I’m glad that the HEROES Act sus-
pends consumer debt collection during the 
COVID–19 emergency and for 120 days after 
the end of the national emergency to make 
sure consumers can fully recover. I worked 
with the Congressional Progressive Caucus to 
make debt collection suspension a priority in 
relief legislation. 
We know that Oregonians are struggling 
through no fault of their own, and they should 
not be further harmed financially. Negative 
credit reporting will be suspended under the 
HEROES Act for the duration of this crisis and 
any future national emergencies. This is an 
essential step to safeguard consumers most 
affected by the current outbreak. I have also 
continued to call for medical debt collection 
and credit reporting suspensions—needed re-
forms to prevent a hospital visit from destroy-
ing the credit of consumers. I am glad to see 
that medical debt related to coronavirus treat-
ments will not result in adverse credit informa-
tion; however, we must give consumers the 
flexibility to settle their medical debt before it 
shows up on a credit report and we must con-
tinue to fight so everyone can access afford-
able health care. 
The HEROES Act also clarifies the intent of 
the CARES Act by preventing the garnish-
ment, levy, or seizing of direct payment for pri-
vate debts. I have been a vocal advocate for 
stopping unfair garnishment and protecting 
payments like Social Security and other es-
sential earned benefits. 
Oregon has strong laws to prevent unfair 
price hikes during crises like the current pan-
demic. I am continuing to work with Oregon 
Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum on ways to 
expand Oregon’s protections to all Americans. 
It’s beneficial that the HEROES Act includes 
provisions to stop unconscionably excessive 
prices on necessities like food, hygiene prod-
ucts, personal protective equipment, and 
health services. 
Workforce boards, labor unions, community 
colleges, 
community-based 
organizations, 
small businesses, and other stakeholders are 
training health care, direct care, and front-line 
workers, but they are in desperate need of 
more resources. I am pleased that the HE-
ROES Act includes $2.5 billion for adult edu-
cation, 
youth 
training, 
dislocated 
worker 
grants, migrant and seasonal farmworker pro-
grams, and public health worker recruitment 
and training as authorized in the Workforce In-
novation and Opportunity Act, but this funding 
is insufficient to meet the scale of the crisis at 
hand. For comparison, the American Reinvest-
ment and Recovery Act provided more than 
$7.7 billion in workforce funding. To respond 
to 
the 
economic 
consequences

coronavirus pandemic, we need at least $15.1 
billion in supplemental federal investments to 
help prevent further layoffs and provide dis-
located workers and employers with access to 
employment services like training, career navi-
gation, and supportive services. I will keep 
working with my colleagues on the Education 
and Labor Committee to advance the Re-
launching America’s Workforce Act because 
the historic unemployment levels over the last 
two months require an equally historic re-
sponse to support workers. 
No one should be forced to choose between 
paying their bills and paying for food, but as 
Oregonians face the ongoing economic con-
sequences of COVID–19, this is becoming a 
reality for too many working families. This bill 
includes $175 billion to assist renters and 
homeowners make monthly rent, mortgage 
and utility payments, and other housing-re-
lated costs. The Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is an important 
wraparound support that helps low-income 
families pay for heating and cooling bills. The 
HEROES Act includes another $1.5 billion in 
supplemental funding for LIHEAP, but many 
more households will need and likely qualify 
for assistance in the coming weeks and 
months. Additionally, as individuals comply 
with stay-at-home orders across the country 
during the pandemic, they will likely be using 
more electricity and heat or air conditioning to 
keep their homes habitable. As we work to 
craft the next response package, I will keep 
fighting for more funding for LIHEAP to pro-
vide tangible assistance to families who are 
struggling to pay their bills. I also advocated 
for assistance similar to LIHEAP that would 
help households economically affected by 
COVID–19 with drinking water and wastewater 
services during this national emergency. The 
HEROES Act includes an additional $1.5 bil-
lion for this support. 
The success of our economic recovery will 
depend on the success of our small busi-
nesses. The Paycheck Protection Program 
was a good first lifeline for many, but many 
business owners are concerned about artificial 
timelines and a lack of flexibility in the pro-
gram. I’m glad that the HEROES Act will ex-
tend the coverage period to the end of 2020 
and give businesses additional flexibility while 
still adhering to local stay-at-home orders that 
may not allow them to fully open and resume 
operating for some time to come. The bill 
would also expand PPP eligibility to additional 
nonprofit organizations of all types and sizes, 
as well as provide an additional $10 billion in 
economic injury disaster grants (EIDL) through 
the Small Business Administration. 
Fisheries are an important part of our econ-
omy in Northwest Oregon, and I know that our 
coastal communities need more assistance to 
get through these challenging times. The HE-
ROES Act provides an additional $100 million 
in disaster funding, and I will keep working to 
secure more direct assistance for fisheries and 
the domestic seafood supply chain. Northwest 
Oregon is known for its prestigious specialty 
crops, and our farmers have been struggling 
to make ends meet during the pandemic. The 
HEROES Act will also support our specialty 
crop farmers by providing $100 million for spe-
cialty crop grants and $50 million for support 
for local farmers markets and other direct to 
consumer markets. 
This bill addresses one of the key short-
comings of previous legislative efforts; the ex-
clusion of individuals from direct economic re-
lief because of their immigration status. The 
HEROES Act retroactively extends direct pay-
ments to mixed-status families and immigrants 
who file taxes using ITINs, and it expands eli-
gibility for other economic support. It removes 
barriers to testing, treatment, vaccines, and 
other health care based solely on immigration 
status and automatically extends work permits 
for individuals with DACA or TPS. The bill of-
fers protections from ICE removal and employ-
ment authorization for individuals in critical in-
dustries, including agricultural workers and 
meatpackers. It also requires ICE to review its 
detention policies and find alternatives for indi-
viduals not subject to mandatory detention. 
Importantly, the HEROES Act strengthens 
our democratic institutions with new resources 
to conduct secure, reliable elections using 
vote-by-mail. Oregonians have used this trust-
ed method of voting for more than twenty 
years, and it should be implemented nation-
wide as a simple and safe solution that will in-
crease access while allowing voters to main-
tain physical distancing measures. 
We must act quickly and decisively to curb 
the spread of COVID–19 and create condi-
tions that will allow us to begin our recovery, 
but we must also act boldly so our response 
is sufficient to prevent a widespread resur-
gence of the virus. We must also not leave 
behind any segment of our society as we work 
to repair the immense and harmful economic 
damage that we see across Oregon and the 
country. We are all safer and healthier when 
everyone in our communities is safer and 
healthier. I commend House leadership for 
putting forward a proposal that responsibly ad-
dresses the desperate need we are currently 
facing while also acknowledging the potentially 
disastrous costs of doing too little. I urge all 
my colleagues to support our nurses, first re-
sponders, grocery workers, and all frontline 
heroes by supporting this legislation.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, members of the South Carolina Na-
tional Guard are heroes. During this chal-
lenging time, it is inspiring that South Carolina 
National Guard Service Members choose to 
serve the citizens of South Carolina. The Na-
tional Guard continues to answer the call and 
assist communities affected by the Wuhan 
Virus. Here are six heroes in South Carolina. 
Doctor (Col.) Phillip Latham is the state Air 
Surgeon for the South Carolina Air National 
Guard, serves as the South Carolina Air Na-
tional Guard medical lead and COVID–19 
medical response coordinator. His efforts and 
accomplishments 
positively

South 
Carolina communities daily. 
Colonel Latham liaises with the South Caro-
lina Hospital Association. He assists statewide 
medical surge planning and weekly regional 
response coordination meetings. Additionally,

tion and South Carolina Manufacturers Em-
powerment program for the creation of central-
ized ordering and distribution of protective per-
sonal equipment. Engineering support state-
wide alternate care site surveys, identified and 
planned for possible infrastructure expansion 
to meet needs in excess of current regional 
hospital capacity. Lastly, he coordinated phase 
2 testing and contact tracing plans in concert 
with the South Carolina Hospital Association, 
South Carolina Emergency Management Divi-
sion, Department of Health and Environmental 
Control and National Guard leadership for a 
roll out of both diagnostic and immunity testing 
across the state. 
Doctor (Lt. Col.) Vanessa Wideman, is the

ant Colonel Wideman advised South Carolina 
National Guard leadership on COVID–19 miti-
gation efforts, mapped out McEntire Joint Na-
tional Guard Base’s strategy and response for 
COVID–19, and advised 169th Fighter Wing 
leadership on Health Protection Condition 
(HPCON) levels. She continues to coordinate 
with the Center for Disease Control and Pre-
vention to improve individualized member re-
sponse to COVID–19 for potentially affected 
members. 
Doctor (Lt. Col.) Fred Smith, is the 157th 
Fighter Squadron, Flight Surgeon. Lieutenant 
Colonel Smith’s testing efforts helped map out 
hospital network efforts across South Carolina. 
He also observed and provided oversight for 
the South Carolina National Guard—civilian 
partnership, in food distribution, and receiving, 
at Harvest Hope food bank. 
Lieutenant Colonel Paul Laymon is the 
169th Security Forces Squadron Commander. 
Lieutenant Colonel Laymon has coordinated, 
organized, planned, staffed, and co-lead the 
development of the COVID–19 Joint Task 
Force—Security (C–JTFS). He also developed 
new Operating Instructions for safe and se-
cure entry onto McEntire Joint National Guard 
Base and authored the National Guard’s Ad-
versary Threat Assessment to include con-
cerns over weaponization of the Novel Virus 
COVID–19. Lastly, he coordinated with the 
South Carolina Department of Health and En-
vironmental Control, and the South Carolina 
Joint Operations Center for the safe-secure 
delivery and redistribution of the CDC National 
Stockpile 
Personal 
Protective 
Equipment 
(PPE). 
Lieutenant Colonel Allen R. Stewart serves 
as the South Carolina National Guard Joint 
Force Headquarters Logistics Director. In this 
capacity, he’s coordinated South Carolina Na-
tional Guard support at Oliver Gospel mission, 
set up Blue Tent training between the Depart-
ment of Health and Environmental Control and 
59th Troop Command, and worked with the 
South Carolina National Guard to set up the 
Georgia Air National Guard’s sanitizing ‘‘Train 
the Trainer’’ classes for the South Carolina 
National 
Guard. 
Furthermore, 
his 
efforts 
helped improve planning efforts and protective 
measures with the South Carolina Department 
of Corrections. Lieutenant Colonel Stewart 
also helped set up South Carolina’s food dis-
tribution in Horry County and facilitated the 
South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicle’s 
plan to use South Carolina National Guard ar-
mories across the state to enable social 
distancing between the public and DMV staff. 
Second Lieutenant Trey Murphy is the Lo-
gistics Readiness Officer for the 169th Logis-
tics Readiness Squadron. Second Lieutenant 
Murphy coordinated and hosted the South 
Carolina Department of Health and Environ-
mental Control Receipt, Store, and Stage 
(RSS) refresher training course, which showed 
how to manage distribution of Strategic Na-
tional Stockpile (SNS) material. His efforts en-
abled his squadron to store over two-hundred 
pallets of personal protective equipment on 
more than fifty tactical convoys, serving all 
forty-six counties in South Carolina. He also 
coordinated the joint effort for the staging of 
US Army personnel and equipment in advance 
of civilian bus driver training conducted on 
McEntire Joint National Guard Base. 
I am grateful to have worked with my col-
leagues in the 116th Congress to provide 
needed funding for vital personal protective 
equipment, material, and support for our Serv-
ice Members and their families. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LENORA 
PRATHER 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in celebration of the life and leg-
acy of Mrs. Lenora Prather, a native of West 
Point, Mississippi and a pioneer in the field of 
law and justice in our state. Mrs. Prather dedi-
cated her life to public service and cemented 
herself in our state’s history, while continuing 
to have an impact on young minds. 
Lenora Prather was born and educated in 
West Point, Mississippi, where she graduated 
from the Mississippi State College for Women 
before continuing her education at the Univer-
sity of Mississippi School of Law, earning her 
juris doctor in 1955. She practiced law with 
her father and later met fellow attorney Bob 
Prather. The two were married and began to 
practice law together until her appointment as 
Municipal Judge in West Point. Together they 
had three daughters. Among her many aca-
demic contributions, she taught in the Commu-
nication Department at Mississippi State Uni-
versity. In 1982, Prather was appointed as 
Chief Justice of the Mississippi Supreme 
Court. She attributed her success in her ca-
reer to her parent’s example. She served as a 
source of inspiration to countless individuals, 
and among her friends and family. 
Mrs. Lenora Prather was a shining example 
of commitment to values, community, and jus-
tice. She had a lasting impact on this state, 
and her example will continue to inspire young 
minds. I commend her lifelong efforts in mak-
ing Mississippi great.

HEALTH 
CARE SYSTEM 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize the staff at Central Arkan-
sas Veterans Healthcare System that volun-
teered to help their sister facility in Louisiana: 
Erin Pitchford, Diana Tran, Latoya Johnson, 
Tonya Filbert, Teri Kennedy, Vickie Mabry, 
Ellen Shollmier, Linda Tate, Joe Wood, Nich-
olas Asman, and Michelle Freck. 
In April, three teams of Central Arkansas 
Veterans 
Healthcare 
System 
Registered 
Nurses, 
Advanced 
Practice 
Registered 
Nurses, and Certified Registered Nurse Anes-
thetics traveled to New Orleans to support the 
Southeast Louisiana Veterans Healthcare Sys-
tem. 
These 11 front-line heroes provided support 
to their sister VA facility during the initial surge 
of COVID–19 in Louisiana. The staff provided 
direct patient care in critical areas of the facil-
ity, including medical and surgical units. 
The purpose of this united effort was to en-
sure the well-being of our veterans who have 
served our country. 
We thank the nurses who are deployed, all 
those who stepped in to fill their shoes back 
home, and CAVHS for their compassion, clin-
ical expertise, and their commitment to serving 
our veterans.

HONORING BEN KELLY 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Ben Kelly, an entre-
preneur, surfboard shaper, and surfer on the 
central coast of California. Ben will be remem-
bered for his kindness, adventurous spirit, and 
passion for his religious faith. 
Ben Kelly was born in Orange County in 
Southern California. While attending Vanguard 
University in Costa Mesa, California, where he 
met his wife, Katie, Ben began shaping surf-
board and eventually developed his own 
brand, Ben Kelly Surfboards. 
Following his move to the central coast of 
California, Ben and Katie started their social 
media company, named Authentic Approach. 
This business encapsulated Ben’s quick em-
brace of his new community. Not only was he 
dedicated to the work he did with his wife to 
help others realize their dreams of starting and 
operating local businesses, but he also quickly 
established himself in the local surfing com-
munity on the Central Coast. Ben’s friends 
knew him as an adventurous young man who 
formed tight bonds with those around him and 
used his supportive and sincere nature to en-
courage friends to excel at their goals. 
Ben was especially passionate about his 
deeply held Christian faith. As a member of 
Twin Lakes Church in Aptos, California, Ben 
channeled his faith to guide his generous na-
ture and devotion to helping friends and 
strangers. Ben’s faith was a part of his daily 
life, finding daily lessons in the world around 
him and offering earnest guidance to anyone 
who needed help. 
Ben will be remembered for his adventurous 
and generous spirit and his love for and devo-
tion to his wife, Katie. We, as a community, 
celebrate his life well-lived. Madam Speaker, I 
ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the 
life of Ben Kelly.

AUTHORIZING REMOTE VOTING BY 
PROXY AND PROVIDING FOR OF-
FICIAL 
REMOTE 
COMMITTEE 
PROCEEDINGS DURING A PUBLIC 
HEALTH EMERGENCY DUE TO A 
NOVEL CORONAVIRUS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H. Res. 965, which is nothing 
more than a power grab by my Democrat col-
leagues that would upend over 200 years of 
precedent and have serious constitutional and 
institutional repercussions. 
Across our nation, millions of Americans go 
to work every day to help their communities 
and defeat the COVID–19 outbreak. They ex-
pect their elected officials to do the same. But 
under the proposal put forth by House Demo-
crats, 20 members would control Congress, 
while the rest stay home and cede their votes. 
Article 1, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution 
states, ‘‘a Majority of each shall constitute a 
Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number 
may adjourn from day to day, and may be au-
thorized to compel the Attendance of absent 
Members.’’ At a time when traveling took days 
to weeks, rather than mere hours, our Found-
ing Fathers recognized that while inconven-
ient, being physically present was necessary 
for good governance. And despite recent leg-
islative sessions, which prove Members of 
Congress can conduct regular business in a 
safe manner, Democrats want to recklessly 
alter the U.S. House of Representatives as 
our founders designed it. 
In addition to throwing out 230 years of tra-
dition, H. Res. 965 stifles the voices of tens of 
millions of Americans. As long as these rules 
are in place, House leadership will control 
every step of the legislative process. Rank 
and file members will be cut out of lawmaking 
completely, in turn denying the people they 
represent a seat at the table. 
Republican Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY, Rules 
Committee Ranking Member TOM COLE, and 
Administration Committee Ranking Member 
RODNEY DAVIS put forward a detailed plan for 
how the House can continue operations during 
this crisis. House Republicans stand ready to 
find bipartisan solutions that ensure members 
can fulfill their constitutional duties. 
But the resolution proposed by House 
Democrats is not the answer. 
Mr. Speaker, our country has faced serious 
challenges since its founding, including the 
Spanish influenza. For the first time in our his-
tory, a single party is taking advantage of a 
crisis to jam through unprecedented and un-
constitutional changes that will forever alter 
this institution. I strongly oppose H. Res. 965, 
which will devastate our democracy and si-
lence the People’s voice.

Tuesday, May 19, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I

Ms. Said is currently the Chairwoman of the 
Madina Institute and Mosque located in my

Established in 1990 to honor individuals for 
their efforts in fighting crime, terrorism, and vi-
olence in the United States, the FBI Director’s 
Community Leadership Award is a true testa-
ment to the work Ms. Said has led to combat 
violence and hate crimes against religious 
groups in Arkansas. 
Ms. Said has brought together law enforce-
ment agencies, religious congregations, and 
community leaders for FBI-lead trainings to 
prevent terrorist attacks in Arkansas. 
On behalf of all Arkansans, I thank Ms. Said 
for her devotion to protecting our Arkansas 
communities, and congratulations on this de-
serving recognition.
