ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. For the informa-

break about 2 hours in. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to 
the provisions of S. Res. 483, the Senate 
has provided up to 4 hours of argument 
by the parties, equally divided, on the 
question of whether or not it shall be 
in order to consider and debate under 
the impeachment rules any motion to 
subpoena witnesses or documents. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF, are you a pro-
ponent or opponent? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Proponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, 
are you a proponent or opponent? 
Mr. CIPOLLONE. Opponent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. SCHIFF, 
you may proceed. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Before I begin, 
Mr. Chief Justice, the House managers 
will be reserving the balance of our 
time to respond to the argument of 
counsel for the President. 
Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, fellow 
House managers, and counsel for the 
President, I know I speak for my fellow 
managers, as well as counsel for the 
President, in thanking you for your 
careful attention to the arguments 
that we have made over the course of 
many long days. 
Today, we were greeted to yet an-
other development in the case when 
the New York Times reported with a 
headline that says: 
Trump Told Bolton to Help His Ukraine 
Pressure Campaign, Book Says 
The President asked his national security 
adviser last spring in front of other senior 
advisers to pave the way for a meeting be-
tween Rudolph Giuliani and Ukraine’s new 
leader. 
According to the New York Times: 
More than two months before he asked 
Ukraine’s president to investigate his polit-
ical opponents, President Trump directed 
John R. Bolton, then his national security 
adviser, to help with his pressure campaign 
to extract damaging information on Demo-
crats from Ukrainian officials, according to 
an unpublished manuscript by Mr. Bolton. 
Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. 
Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office con-
versation in early May that included the act-
ing 
White 
House 
chief 
of 
staff, 
Mick 
Mulvaney, the president’s personal lawyer 
Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House 
counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading 
the President’s impeachment defense. 
You will see in a few moments—and 
you will recall Mr. Cipollone sug-
gesting that the House managers were 
concealing facts from this body. He 
said all the facts should come out. 
Well, there is a new fact which indi-
cates that Mr. Cipollone was one of 
those who were in the loop—yet an-
other reason why we ought to hear

from witnesses. Just as we predicted— 
and it didn’t require any great act of 
clairvoyance—the facts will come out. 
They will continue to come out. And 
the question before you today is wheth-
er they will come out in time for you 
to make a complete and informed judg-
ment as to the guilt or innocence of 
the President. 
Now, that Times article goes on to 
say: 
Mr. 
Trump 
told 
Mr. 
Bolton 
to 
call 
Volodymyr Zelensky, who had recently won 
election as president of Ukraine, to ensure 
Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani, 
who was planning a trip to Ukraine to dis-
cuss the investigations that the President 
sought, in Mr. Bolton’s account. Mr. Bolton 
never made the call, he wrote. 
‘‘Never made the call.’’ Mr. Bolton 
understood that this was wrong. He un-
derstood that this was not policy. He 
understood that this was a domestic 
political errand and refused to make 
the call. 
The account in Mr. Bolton’s manuscript 
portrays the most senior White House advis-
ers as early witnesses in the effort that they 
have sought to distance the President from. 
Including the White House Counsel. 
Over several pages— 
According to the Times— 
Mr. Bolton laid out Mr. Trump’s fixation on 
Ukraine and the president’s belief, based on 
a mix of scattershot events, assertions and 
outright conspiracy theories, that Ukraine 
tried to undermine his chances of winning 
the presidency in 2016. 
As he began to realize the extent and aims 
of the pressure campaign, Mr. Bolton began 
to object, he wrote in the book, affirming the 
testimony of a former National Security 
Council aide, Fiona Hill, who had said that 
Mr. Bolton warned that Mr. Giuliani was ‘‘a 
hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody 
up.’’ 
Now, as you might imagine, the 
President denies this. The President 
said today: ‘‘I never instructed John 
Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy 
Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption 
fighters in America.’’ 
So here you have the President say-
ing John Bolton is not telling the 
truth. Let’s find out. Let’s put John 
Bolton under oath. Let’s find out who 
is telling the truth. A trial is supposed 
to be a quest for the truth. Let’s not 
fear what we will learn. As Mr. 
Cipollone said, let’s make sure that all 
facts come out. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice, 
Senators, 
counsel 
for 
the 
President, last Tuesday, at the onset of 
this trial, we moved for Leader MCCON-
NELL’s resolution to be amended to sub-
poena documents and witnesses from 
the outset. This body decided to hold 
the question over. You have now heard 
opening arguments from both sides. 
You have seen the evidence that the 
House was able to collect. You have 
heard about the documents and wit-
nesses President Trump blocked from 
the House’s impeachment inquiry. We 
have vigorously questioned both sides. 
The President’s counsel has urged 
you to decide this case and render your 
verdict upon the record assembled by 
the House. The evidence in the record 
is sufficient. It is sufficient to convict 
the President on both Articles of Im-
peachment—more than sufficient. 
But that is simply not how trials 
work. As any prosecutor or defense 
lawyer would tell you, when a case 
goes to trial, both sides call witnesses 
and subpoena documents to bring be-
fore the jury. That happens every day 
in courtrooms all across America. 
There is no reason why this impeach-
ment trial should be any different. The 
commonsense practice is borne out of 
precedence. There has never been— 
never before been—a full Senate im-
peachment trial without a single wit-
ness. In fact, you can see in the slide 
that in every one of the 15 prior im-
peachment trials the Senate has called 
multiple witnesses. Today we ask you 
to follow this body’s uniform prece-
dence and your common sense. We urge 
you to vote in favor of subpoenaing 
witnesses and documents. 
Now, I would like to address one 
question at the outset. There has been 
much back and forth about whether if 
the House believes it has sufficient evi-
dence to convict, which we do, why do 
we need more witnesses and docu-
ments? So I would like to be clear. The 
evidence presented over the past week 
and a half strongly supports a vote to 
convict the President. The evidence is 
overwhelming. We have a mountain of 
evidence. It is direct, it is corroborated 
by multiple sources, and it proves that 
the President committed grave im-
peachable offenses to cheat in the next 
election. 
The evidence confirms that if left in 
office, President Trump will continue 
to harm America’s national security. 
He will continue to seek to corrupt the 
upcoming election. And he will under-
mine—he will undermine—our democ-
racy all to further his own personal 
gain. 
But this is a fundamental question 
that must be addressed: Is this a fair 
trial? Is this a fair trial? Is this a fair 
trial? Without the ability to call wit-
nesses and produce documents, the an-
swer is clearly and unequivocally no. It 
was the President’s decision to contest 
the facts, and that is his right, but be-
cause he has chosen to contest the 
facts, he shall not be heard to complain 
that the House wishes to further prove 
his guilt to answer the questions he 
would raise. He complains that few wit-
nesses spoke directly to the President 
about his misconduct beyond his damn-
ing conversations with Sondland and 
Mulvaney. OK, let’s hear from others, 
then—the witnesses the House wishes 
to call directly to the President’s own 
words, his own admissions of guilt, his 
own confessions of responsibility. If 
they did not, all the President’s men 
would be on their witness list, not ours. 
These witnesses and the documents 
their agencies produced tell the full 
story. And I believe that we are inter-
ested in hearing the full story. You 
should want to hear it. More than that, 
the American people—we know they 
want to hear it. 
The House Republicans’ own expert 
witness in the House, Professor Turley, 
said, if you could prove the President 
used our military aid to pressure 
Ukraine to investigate a political rival 
and interfere in our elections, it would 
be an impeachable abuse of power. Sen-
ator GRAHAM, too, recognized that, if 
such evidence existed, it could poten-
tially change his mind on impeach-
ment. 
Well, we now have another witness— 
a fact witness—who would reportedly 
say exactly that. Ambassador Bolton’s 
new manuscript, which we will discuss 
in more detail in a moment, reportedly 
confirms that the President told him in 
no uncertain terms—we are talking 
about the former National Security 
Advisor saying that the President told 
him in no uncertain terms—no aid 
until 
investigations, 
including 
the 
Bidens. 
For a week and a half, the President 
has said no such evidence exists. They 
are wrong. If you have any doubt about 
the evidence, the evidence is at your 
fingertips. The question is: Will you let 
all of us, including the American peo-
ple, hear—simply hear—the evidence 
and make up their own minds? And you 
can make up your own minds, but will 
we let the American people hear all of 
the evidence? 
You will recall that Ambassador 
Bolton, the President’s former Na-
tional Security Advisor, is one of the 
witnesses we asked for last Tuesday. 
We did not know, at the time, what he 
would say. We didn’t know what kind 
of witness he would be, but Ambas-
sador Bolton made clear that he was 
willing to testify and that he had rel-
evant, firsthand knowledge that had 
not yet been heard. We urged—we ar-
gued—that we all deserved to hear that 
evidence, but the President opposed 
him. Now we know why—because John 
Bolton could corroborate the rest of 
our evidence and confirm the Presi-
dent’s guilt. 
So, today, Senators, we come before 
you, and we urge again—we argue— 
that you let this witness and the other 
key witnesses we have identified come 
forward so you will have all of the in-
formation available to you when you 
make this consequential decision. 
If witnesses are not called here, these 
proceedings will be a trial in name 
only, and the American people clearly 
know a fair trial when they see one. 
Large majorities of the American peo-
ple want to hear from witnesses in this 
trial, and they have a right to hear 
from witnesses in this trial. Let’s hear 
from them. Let’s look them in the eye, 
gain their credibility, and hear what 
they have to say about the President’s 
actions. 
For the same reasons, this body 
should grant our request to subpoena 
documents, the documents that the 
President also blocked the House from 
obtaining—documents from the White 
House, the State Department, the 
DOD, and the OMB—that will complete 
the story and provide the whole truth,

whatever that may be. We ask that you 
subpoena these documents so that you 
can decide for yourselves. If you have 
any doubt as to what occurred, let’s 
look at this additional evidence. 
To be clear, we are not asking you to 
track down every single document or 
to call every possible witness. We have 
carefully identified only four key wit-
nesses with direct knowledge, who can 
speak to the specific issues that the 
President has disputed, and we have 
targeted key documents which we un-
derstand have already been collected. 
For example, at the State Department, 
they have already been collected. 
This will not cause a substantial 
delay. As I made clear last night, these 
matters can be addressed in a single 
week. As we made clear last night, 
these matters can be addressed in a 
single week. We know that from Presi-
dent Clinton’s case. There, the Senate 
voted to approve a motion for wit-
nesses on January 27. The next day, it 
established procedures for those depo-
sitions and adjourned as a Court of Im-
peachment until February 4. In that 
brief period, the parties took three 
depositions. The Senate then resumed 
its proceedings by voting to accept the 
deposition testimony into the RECORD. 
In this trial, too, let’s do the same. 
We should take a brief, 1-week break 
for witness testimony and document 
collection, during which time the Sen-
ate can return to its normal business. 
The trial should not be allowed to be 
different from every other impeach-
ment trial or any other kind of trial 
simply because the President doesn’t 
want us to know the truth. The Amer-
ican people—the American people we 
all represent, the American people we 
all love and care about—deserve to 
know the truth, and a fair trial re-
quires it. 
This is too important of a decision to 
be made without all of the relevant evi-
dence. Before turning to the specific 
need for these witnesses and docu-
ments, I want to make clear that we 
are not asking you, again, to break 
new ground. We are asking quite the 
opposite. We are asking you to simply 
follow the Senate’s unbroken precedent 
and to do so in a manner that allows 
you to continue the Senate’s ordinary 
business. 
The Senate, in sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, has heard witness testi-
mony in every other—as we have said 
earlier—15 impeachment trials in the 
history of the Republic. In fact, these 
trials had an average of 33 witnesses, 
and the Senate has repeatedly subpoe-
naed and received new documents while 
adjudicating cases of impeachment. 
That makes sense. Under our Constitu-
tion, the Senate does not just vote on 
impeachments, and it does not just de-
bate them. Instead, the Senate is com-
manded by the Constitution to try all 
cases of impeachment. Well, a trial re-
quires witnesses. A trial requires docu-
ments. This is the American way, and 
this is the American story. 
If the Senate denies our motions, it 
would be the only time in history it 
has written a judgment on Articles of 
Impeachment without hearing from a 
single witness or receiving a single rel-
evant document from the President, 
whose conduct is on trial. And why? 
How can we justify this break from 
precedent? How would we justify it? 
For what reason would we break prece-
dent in these proceedings? 
There are many compelling reasons 
beyond precedent that demand sub-
poenas for witnesses and cases and doc-
uments in this case. 
At this time, I yield to Manager GAR-
CIA. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, President’s counsel, Sen-
ators, last week, I shared with you that 
I was reflecting on my first days at a 
school for baby judges. You all may re-
call that. I mentioned to you that one 
of the first things they told us was that 
we had to be good listeners and be pa-
tient, and you, as judges in this trial, 
have certainly passed the test. Thank 
you for being good listeners and for 
being patient with us. It has been quite 
a long journey. 
We are here today to talk about the 
other thing they told us in baby judge 
school, and that was that we had to 
give all of the parties in front of us a 
fair hearing—an opportunity to be 
heard, an opportunity to cross-examine 
witnesses, an opportunity to bring evi-
dence. That is what I want to talk to 
you about today because, in terms of 
fundamental fairness, subpoenas by the 
Senate in this trial would mitigate the 
damage caused by the President’s 
wholesale obstruction of the House’s 
inquiry. 
The President claims that there is no 
direct evidence of his wrongdoing de-
spite direct evidence to the contrary 
and Ambassador Bolton’s offer to tes-
tify to even more evidence in a trial. 
Let’s not forget that the President is 
arguing that there is no direct evidence 
while blocking all of us from getting 
that direct evidence. 
It is a remarkable position that they 
have taken. Quite frankly, never, as a 
lawyer or as a former judge, have I ever 
seen anything like this. For the first 
time in our history, President Trump 
ordered his entire administration—his 
entire administration—to defy every 
single 
impeachment 
subpoena. 
The 
Trump administration has not pro-
duced a single document in response to 
the congressional subpoenas—not a sin-
gle page, nada. That has never hap-
pened before. There is no legal privi-
lege to justify a blanket blocking of all 
of these documents. We know that 
there are more relevant documents. 
There is no dispute about that; it is 
uncontested. Witnesses have testified 
in exceptional detail about these docu-
ments that exist that the President is 
simply hiding. 
President Trump’s blanket order of 
prohibiting the entire executive branch 
from participating in the impeachment 
investigation also extends to witnesses. 
There are 12 in all who followed that 
order and refused to testify. Much of 
the critical evidence we have is the re-
sult of career officials who bravely 
came forward despite the President’s 
obstruction, but those closest to the 
President—some may say, like in the 
musical ‘‘Hamilton,’’ those ‘‘in the 
room when it happened’’—followed his 
instruction. 
The President does not dispute that 
these witnesses have information that 
is relevant to this trial, that these in-
dividuals have personal and direct 
knowledge of the President’s actions 
and motivations and can provide the 
very evidence he says now that we 
don’t have. 
The President’s counsel alleged the 
House managers hid evidence from you. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. [B]ecause as 
house managers, really their goal should be 
to give you all of the facts because they’re 
asking you to do something very, very con-
sequential. 
And ask yourself, ask yourself, given the 
fact you heard today that they didn’t tell 
you, who doesn’t want to talk about the 
facts? Who doesn’t want to talk about the 
facts? 
Impeachment shouldn’t be a shell game. 
They should give you the facts. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. This 
is nice rhetoric, but it is simply incor-
rect. 
The 
President’s 
counsel 
cherry- 
picked misleading bits of evidence, 
cited deposition transcripts of wit-
nesses 
who 
subsequently 
corrected 
their testimony in public hearings and 
said the opposite and, in some cases, 
simply left out the second half of wit-
ness statements. 
The House managers accurately pre-
sented the relevant evidence to you. 
We spent about 20 hours presenting the 
facts and the evidence. The President’s 
counsel spent 4 hours focusing on the 
facts and the evidence, and that evi-
dence shows that the President is 
guilty. But to the extent certain facts 
were shown to you, let’s be very clear: 
We are not the ones hiding the facts. 
The House managers did not hide that 
evidence. President Trump hid the evi-
dence. That is why we are the ones 
standing up here, asking you to not let 
the President silence these witnesses 
and hide these documents. 
We don’t know precisely what the 
witnesses will say or what the docu-
ments would show, but we all deserve 
to hear the truth. And, more impor-
tantly, the American people deserve to 
hear the truth. 
Never before has a President been 
put—put himself above the law and hid 
the facts of his offenses from the Amer-
ican people like this one. We cannot let 
this President be different. Quite sim-
ply, the stakes are too high. 
Second, as this builds on what we 
have been arguing, the Senate requires 
and should want a complete evi-
dentiary record before you vote on the 
most sacred task that the Constitution 
entrusts in every single one of you. 
I can respect that some of you have 
deep beliefs that the removal of this 
President would be divisive. Others,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S756 
January 31, 2020 
you may believe that allowing this 
President to remain in the Oval Office 
would be catastrophic to our Republic 
and our democracy. 
But regardless of where you are, re-
gardless of where you land on the spec-
trum, you should want a full and com-
plete record before you make a final 
decision and to understand the full 
story. It should not be about party af-
filiation; it should be about seeing all 
the evidence and voting your con-
science based on all the relevant facts. 
It should be about doing impartial jus-
tice. 
Consider the harm done to our insti-
tutions, our constitutional order, and 
the public faith in our democracy if the 
Senate chooses to close its eyes to 
learning the full truth about the Presi-
dent’s misconduct. 
How can the American people have 
confidence in the result of a trial with-
out witnesses? 
Third, the President should want a 
fair trial. He has repeatedly said that 
publicly; that he wants a trial on the 
merits. He specifically said it. You saw 
a clip that he wanted a fair trial in the 
Senate, and that would have to be with 
witnesses that testify, including John 
Bolton and Mick Mulvaney. He said 
that he wants a complete and total ex-
oneration. 
Well, whatever you say about this 
trial, there cannot be a total—an exon-
eration without hearing from those 
witnesses because an acquittal on an 
incomplete record after a trial lacking 
witnesses and evidence will be no exon-
eration. It will be no vindication—not 
for the President, not for this Cham-
ber, and not for the American people. 
And if the President is telling the 
truth and he did nothing wrong and the 
evidence would prove that, then we all 
know that he would be an enthusiastic 
supporter of subpoenas. He would be 
here probably himself, if he could, urg-
ing you to do subpoenas if he had infor-
mation that would prove he was totally 
not in the wrong. If he is innocent, he 
should have nothing to hide. His coun-
sel should be the ones here asking 
today 
to 
subpoena 
Bolton 
and 
Mulvaney and others for testimony. 
The President would be eager to have 
the people closest to him to testify 
about his innocence. He would be eager 
to present the documents that show he 
was concerned about corruption and 
burden-sharing. But the fact that he 
has so strenuously opposed the testi-
mony of his closest advisers and all the 
documents speak volumes. 
You should issue subpoenas to the 
President so that the President can get 
the fair trial that he wanted—but more 
importantly, so the American people 
can get the fair trial that they deserve. 
The American people deserve a fair 
trial. 
I said at the onset of this trial that 
one of the most important decisions 
you would make at this moment in his-
tory will not be whether you convict or 
acquit but whether the President and 
the American people will get a fair 
trial. 
The process is more than just the ul-
timate decision because the faith in 
our institution depends on the percep-
tion of a fair process. A vote against 
witnesses and documents undermines 
that faith. 
Senators, the American people want 
a fair trial. The overwhelming major-
ity of Americans, three in four voters— 
three in four—as of this past Tuesday 
believe that this trial should have wit-
nesses. Now, there is not much that the 
American people agree on these days, 
but they do agree on that, and they 
know what a fair trial is; that it in-
volves witnesses and it involves evi-
dence. 
The American people deserve to 
know the facts about their President’s 
conduct and those around him, and 
they deserve to have confidence in this 
process, confidence that you made the 
right decision. In order to have that 
confidence, the Senate must call rel-
evant witnesses and obtain relevant 
documents withheld thus far by this 
President. The American people de-
serve a fair trial. 
I now yield to my colleague Manager 
CROW. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, counsel 
for the President, last week the House 
managers argued for the testimony of 
four 
witnesses: 
Ambassador 
John 
Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, Robert Blair, 
and Michael Duffey. And during the 
presentations from both parties, it has 
become abundantly clear why the di-
rect testimony from those witnesses is 
so critical, and new evidence continues 
to underscore that importance. 
So let’s start with John Bolton. The 
President’s 
counsel 
has 
repeatedly 
stated that the President didn’t per-
sonally tell any of our witnesses that 
he linked the military aid to the inves-
tigations. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
PURPURA: There is simply no evidence 
anywhere that President Trump ever linked 
security assistance to any investigations[.] 
[M]ost of the democrats[’] witnesses have 
never spoken to the President at all let alone 
about Ukraine security assistance. 
. . . 
Not a single witness testified that the 
President himself said that there was any 
connection between any investigations and 
security assistance, a presidential meeting, 
or anything else. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Now, that is 
simply not true, as the testimony of 
Ambassador Sondland and the admis-
sion of Mick Mulvaney make very 
clear. 
The evidence before you proves that 
the President not only linked the aid 
to the investigations, he also condi-
tioned both the White House meeting 
and the aid on Ukraine’s announce-
ment of the investigations. 
But if you want more, a witness to 
acknowledge that the President told 
them directly that the aid was linked, 
a witness in front of you, then you 
have the power to ask for it. 
I mentioned this portion—there is a 
slide. I mentioned this portion of the 
Ambassador’s manuscript in the begin-
ning, and Manager SCHIFF referenced it 
as well, but he said directly that the 
President told him this. 
Now, the President has publicly 
lashed out in recent days at Ambas-
sador Bolton. He says that Ambassador 
Bolton is—what Ambassador Bolton is 
saying is ‘‘nasty’’ and ‘‘untrue.’’ But 
denials in 280 characters is not the 
same as testimony under oath. We 
know that. 
Let’s put Ambassador Bolton under 
oath and ask him point blank: Did the 
President use $391 million of taxpayer 
money—military aid intended for an 
ally at war—to pressure Ukraine to in-
vestigate his 2020 opponent? The stakes 
are too high not to. 
I would like to briefly walk you 
through why Ambassador Bolton’s tes-
timony is essential to ensuring a fair 
trial, also addressing some of the ques-
tions that you have asked in the past 2 
days. 
First, turning back to Ambassador 
Bolton’s manuscript, the President’s 
counsel has said: No scheme existed. 
And the President’s counsel has cited 
repeated denials, public denials of 
President Trump’s inner circle about 
Bolton’s allegations—none of them, of 
course, under oath. And as we know 
from the testimony of Ambassador 
Bolton, how important being sworn in 
really is. 
But Ambassador Bolton, as the top 
national security aide, has direct in-
sight into the President’s inner circle, 
and he is willing to testify under oath 
whether ‘‘everyone was in the loop,’’ as 
he testified before. 
Ambassador Bolton reportedly knows 
‘‘new details about senior cabinet offi-
cials who have publicly tried to side-
step involvement,’’ including Secretary 
Pompeo and Mr. Mulvaney’s knowledge 
of the scheme. 
Second, Ambassador Bolton has di-
rect knowledge of key events outside of 
the July 25 call that confirm the Presi-
dent’s scheme. Remember, this is ex-
actly the type of direct evidence the 
President’s counsel say doesn’t exist. 
That is partly because they would like 
you to believe that the July 25 call 
makes up all of the evidence of our 
case. The call, of course, is just a part 
of the large body of evidence that you 
have heard about the past week, but it 
is a key part. But Ambassador Bolton 
has critical insight into the President’s 
misconduct outside of this call, and 
you should hear it. 
Take, for example, the July 10 meet-
ing with U.S. and Ukrainian officials at 
the White House. Dr. Hill testified dur-
ing 
the 
meeting 
that 
Ambassador 
Sondland said that he had a deal with 
Mr. Mulvaney to schedule a White 
House meeting if Ukrainians did the in-
vestigations. According to Dr. Hill, 
when Ambassador Bolton learned this, 
he told her to go back to the NSC’s 
Legal Advisor, John Eisenberg, and tell 
him, ‘‘I am not a part of whatever drug 
deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cook-
ing up on this.’’ We already have cor-
roboration of Dr. Hill’s testimony from

other witnesses like Lieutenant Colo-
nel Vindman. 
And we have new corroboration from 
Ukraine 
too. 
Oleksandr 
Danylyuk, 
President Zelensky’s former national 
security advisor, recently confirmed in 
an interview that the ‘‘roadmap [for 
U.S.-Ukraine relations] should have 
been the substance but . . . [the inves-
tigations] were raised.’’ 
Danylyuk also explained why this 
was so problematic. He raised concerns 
that being ‘‘dragged into this internal 
process . . . would be really bad for the 
country. And also, if there’s something 
that violates U.S. law, that’s up to the 
U.S. to handle.’’ 
Danylyuk elaborated that there were 
serious things to discuss at the meet-
ing, but if instead Ukraine was dragged 
into ‘‘internal politics, using our presi-
dent who was fresh on the job, inexpe-
rienced, that could just destroy every-
thing.’’ 
Another key defense raised by the 
President has been that Ukraine felt no 
pressure, that these investigations are 
entirely proper. Well, here is Ukraine 
saying the opposite of that. You know 
what else Danylyuk said in the inter-
view? ‘‘It was definitely John who I 
trusted,’’ talking about Ambassador 
Bolton. 
So if you want to know whether 
Ukrainians felt pressure, call John 
Bolton as a witness. He was trusted by 
Ukraine, and he was there for these 
key meetings, and he was so concerned 
that he characterized the scheme as a 
‘‘drug deal’’ and urged Dr. Hill and oth-
ers to report their concerns to NSC 
legal counsel, who reports to White 
House Counsel Cipollone. 
So let’s ask Ambassador Bolton these 
questions directly under oath: The 
President says Ukraine felt no pres-
sure, that soliciting these investiga-
tions wasn’t improper. Is that true? If 
it is true, why is Ukraine publicly say-
ing that the talk of investigations 
could destroy everything? And if the 
President’s 
administration 
thought 
this was OK, why did you use the words 
‘‘drug deal?’’ We should ask him that. 
Why did you urge your staff to report 
concerns to lawyers? These are all 
questions that we can get the answers 
to. 
Third, the President has suggested 
the House managers have not presented 
any 
direct 
evidence 
about 
Mr. 
Giuliani’s role in the scheme. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. Counsel RASKIN. In fact, it appears 
the House committee wasn’t particularly in-
terested in presenting you with any direct 
evidence of what Mayor Giuliani did or why 
he did it. Instead, they ask you to rely on 
hearsay, speculation, and assumption, evi-
dence that would be inadmissible in any 
court. 
Mr. 
Manager 
CROW. 
Well, 
once 
again, that is simply not true. But if 
you want more evidence, we know that 
Ambassador Bolton has direct evidence 
of 
Mr. 
Giuliani’s 
role 
regarding 
Ukraine and expressed concerns about 
it. 
The President has suggested that Mr. 
Giuliani wasn’t doing anything im-
proper, and he was not involved in con-
ducting policy. By their own admis-
sion, they said he wasn’t doing policy. 
So let’s ask John Bolton what Giuliani 
was doing and whether the investiga-
tions were politically motivated or 
part of our foreign policy. 
He would know. Dr. Hill testified 
that 
Ambassador 
Bolton 
said 
Mr. 
Giuliani was ‘‘a hand grenade,’’ which 
he explained referred to ‘‘all of the 
statements that Mr. Giuliani was mak-
ing publicly, that the investigations 
that he was promoting, that the story 
line he was promoting, the narrative he 
was promoting was going to backfire.’’ 
The narrative Mr. Giuliani was pro-
moting, of course, was asking Ukraine 
to dig up dirt on Biden. 
Dr. Hill also testified that Ambas-
sador Bolton was so concerned, he told 
Dr. Hill and other members of the NSC 
staff that ‘‘nobody should be meeting 
with Giuliani,’’ and that he was ‘‘close-
ly monitoring what Mr. Giuliani was 
doing and the messaging he was send-
ing out.’’ 
So let’s ask Ambassador Bolton: If 
Mr. Giuliani wasn’t doing anything 
wrong, why were you so concerned 
about his behavior that you directed 
your staff to have no part in this? If 
Mr. Giuliani wasn’t trying to dig up 
dirt on Biden, why did you seem to 
think that he could ‘‘blow everything 
up’’? 
Fourth, the President has said that 
there was nothing wrong with the July 
25 call. But once again the evidence 
suggests 
that 
Ambassador 
Bolton 
would testify that the opposite is true. 
According to witness testimony, Am-
bassador Bolton expressed concerns 
even before the call that it would be ‘‘a 
disaster’’ because he thought there 
could be ‘‘talk of investigations or 
worse.’’ Now, if the President would 
have you believe that the call was per-
fect, as he has repeatedly stated, why 
don’t we find out? Because all of the 
evidence before you suggests otherwise. 
And Ukraine knows this is not the 
case. 
The 
call 
was 
not 
perfect. 
Danylyuk is clear on this point. He 
said: 
One thing I can tell you that was clear 
from this [July 25] call is that the issue of 
the investigations is an issue of concern for 
Trump. It was clear. 
But if there is still any uncertainty, 
we must ask Ambassador Bolton: If 
there was no scheme, how did you 
know President Trump would raise in-
vestigations on the call? What made 
you so concerned the call would be a 
‘‘disaster’’? 
Fifth, the President’s main defense, 
once again, is that he withheld the 
military aid for legitimate reasons. 
But the evidence doesn’t support that. 
You have heard a lot. The evidence 
doesn’t support that. Witness testi-
mony, emails, and other documents 
confirm that Ambassador Bolton and 
his subordinates on many occasions, 
including through in-person meetings 
with the President himself, urged the 
President that there was no legitimate 
reason to withhold the aid. 
But if you are not sure, if you think 
this could in any way have been about 
a legitimate policy reason, let’s ask 
the National Security Advisor, who 
was in charge of that. If this was sim-
ply a policy dispute, as the President 
argues, let’s ask John Bolton whether 
that is true. 
The President also argues that you 
cannot evaluate the President’s subjec-
tive intent—that the President can use 
his power any way he feels is appro-
priate. That is, of course, not the case. 
Whether his intent was corrupt is a 
central part of this case, as it is in 
nearly every criminal case in the coun-
try. As a backup argument, however, 
the President’s counsel claims that we 
want you to read the President’s mind. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. This entire im-
peachment process is about the House man-
agers’ insistence that they are able to read 
everybody’s 
thoughts. 
They 
can 
read 
everybody’s intention . . . 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. They think you 
can read minds. 
Mr. PHILBIN. They want to tell you what 
President Trump thought. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Now, juries, of 
course, are routinely asked to deter-
mine the defendant’s state of mind. 
That is central to almost every crimi-
nal case in the country. And it is dis-
ingenuous for the President’s counsel 
to argue that the defendant’s state of 
mind in unknowable, that it requires a 
mind reader, or is anything but the 
most common element of proof of any 
crime, constitutional or otherwise. But 
if you want more information, let’s ask 
the President whether John Bolton can 
help fill in any gaps about his state of 
mind. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. If you think about it, 
he knows some of my thoughts. He knows 
what I think about leaders. 
Mr. Manager CROW. This case is 
about 
the 
President’s 
conduct 
in 
Ukraine. John Bolton knows a lot 
about that. Let’s hear from him. A fair 
trial demands it. It is more than just 
ensuring a fair trial, it is about remem-
bering that in America, truth matters. 
As Mr. Bolton said on January 30, ‘‘the 
idea that somehow testifying to what 
you think is true is destructive to the 
system of government we have, I think 
is very nearly the reverse, the exact re-
verse of the truth.’’ 
As Manager SCHIFF started this out, 
the truth continues to come out. 
Again, in an article today, more infor-
mation. The truth will come out, and it 
is continuing to. The question here be-
fore this body is, What do you want 
your place in history to be? Do you 
want your place in history to be let’s 
hear the truth or that we don’t want to 
hear it? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Given our 
time constraints, we will now summa-
rize the reasons why Mr. Mulvaney, 
Mr. Duffey, and Mr. Blair are also im-
portant.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S758 
January 31, 2020 
Let’s turn first to Mr. Mulvaney. To 
begin with, Mr. Mulvaney participated 
in meetings and discussions with Presi-
dent Trump at every single stage of 
this scheme. We just talked about mo-
tives and intent. Well, if you want fur-
ther insight into the President’s mo-
tives or intent, further direct evidence 
of why he withheld the military aid 
and the White House meeting, you 
should call his Acting Chief of Staff, 
who has more access than anyone. 
Mr. Mulvaney is important because 
the President’s counsel continues to 
argue—incorrectly—that our evidence 
is just hearsay and speculation. Faced 
with Ambassador Sondland and Mr. 
Holmes saying this was all as clear as 
two plus two equals four, the President 
says, ‘‘[T]hey are just guessing.’’ That 
is simply not true. The evidence is di-
rect, the evidence is compelling and 
confirmed by many witnesses, corrobo-
rated by text messages, emails, and 
phone records. But if you want more 
evidence, if you want another firsthand 
account of why the aid was withheld 
for the undisputed quid pro quo for 
that White House meeting, let’s just 
hear from Mick Mulvaney. 
Over and over again, Ambassador 
Sondland described to multiple wit-
nesses how Mr. Mulvaney was directly 
involved in the President’s scheme. 
Here is some of that testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. So when I came in, Gordon 
Sondland was basically saying, Look, we 
have a deal here. There will be a meeting. I 
have a deal here with Chief of Staff 
Mulvaney, there will be a meeting if the 
Ukrainians open up or announce these inves-
tigations into 2016 and Burisma. And I cut it 
off immediately there. 
Ambassador Bolton told me that: I am not 
part 
of 
this 
whatever 
drug 
deal 
that 
Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What did you understand 
him to mean by the drug deal that Mulvaney 
and Sondland were cooking up? 
Dr. HILL. I took it to mean investigations 
for a meeting. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you go to see the law-
yers? 
Dr. HILL. I certainly did. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. What I want to ask 
you about is, he makes reference in that 
drug deal to a drug deal cooked up by you 
and 
Mulvaney. 
It’s 
the 
reference 
to 
Mulvaney that I want to ask you about. 
You’ve testified that Mulvaney was aware of 
this quid pro quo, of this condition that the 
Ukrainians had to meet, that is, announcing 
these public investigations to get the White 
House meeting. Is that right? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Yeah. A lot of 
people were aware of it . . . 
Mr. 
Manager 
SCHIFF. 
Including 
Mr. 
Mulvaney. 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Correct. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Remark-
ably, the President is still denying the 
facts, even as they argue that if it is 
true, it is still not impeachable. But if 
the President did nothing wrong, if he 
held up the aid because of so-called 
corruption or burden-sharing reasons, 
he should want his chief of staff to 
come testify under oath before this dis-
tinguished body and say just that. 
Why doesn’t he want Mulvaney to ap-
pear before the United States Senate? 
Well, we know the answer—because Mr. 
Mulvaney will confirm the corrupt 
shakedown 
scheme 
because 
Mr. 
Mulvaney was in the loop. 
Everyone was in the loop. 
As Ambassador Sondland summa-
rized in his testimony on July 19, he 
emailed several top administration of-
ficials, including Mr. Mulvaney, that 
President Zelensky was prepared to re-
ceive POTUS’s call and would ‘‘assure’’ 
President Trump that ‘‘he intends to 
run a fully transparent investigation 
and will ‘turn over every stone.’’’ 
Mr. Mulvaney replied: ‘‘I asked NSC 
to set it up for tomorrow.’’ 
The above email seems clear. Ambas-
sador Sondland testified that it was 
clear; that he was confirming to Mr. 
Mulvaney that he had told President 
Zelensky he had to tell President 
Trump on that July 25 call that he 
would 
announce 
the 
investigation, 
which he explained was a reference to 
one of the two phony political inves-
tigations that President Trump want-
ed. And Mr. Mulvaney replies that he 
will set up the meeting—consistent 
with the agreement that Sondland ex-
plained he reached with Mr. Mulvaney 
to condition a meeting on the inves-
tigations. 
But if there is any uncertainty, if 
there is any lingering questions about 
what this means, let’s just question 
Mick Mulvaney under oath. 
Mr. Mulvaney also matters because 
we have heard several questions from 
this distinguished body of Senators 
wanting to understand when or why or 
how the President ordered the hold on 
the security aid. As the head of the Of-
fice of Management and Budget, Mr. 
Mulvaney has unique insights into all 
of these questions—your questions. 
Remember that email exchange be-
tween Mr. Mulvaney and his Deputy, 
Rob Blair, on June 27, when Mulvaney 
asked Blair about whether they could 
implement the hold and Blair re-
sponded that it could be done but that 
Congress would become ‘‘unhinged’’? 
It wasn’t just Congress. It was the 
independent 
Government 
Account-
ability Office that determined that the 
President’s hold violated the law. But, 
if the President’s counsel is going to 
argue—without evidence—that he with-
held the aid as part of U.S. foreign pol-
icy, it seems to make sense that the 
Senate should hear directly from Mr. 
Mulvaney, who has firsthand knowl-
edge of exactly these facts. He said so 
himself. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. MULVANEY: Again, I was involved 
with the process by which the money was 
held up temporarily, okay? 
Mr. 
Manager 
JEFFRIES. 
Why 
doesn’t President Trump want Mick 
Mulvaney to testify? Why? 
Perhaps here is why: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Answer. Did he also mention to me in the 
past that the corruption related to the DNC 
server, absolutely. No question about that. 
But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the 
money. 
Question. So the demand for an investiga-
tion into the Democrats was part of the rea-
son that he wanted to withhold funding to 
Ukraine. 
Answer. The look back to what happened 
in 2016— 
Question. The investigation into Demo-
crats— 
Answer.—certainly was part of the thing 
that he was worried about in corruption with 
that nation. That is absolutely appropriate. 
Question. But to be clear, what you just 
described is a quid pro quo. It is: Funding 
will not flow unless the investigation into 
the Democratic server happens as well. 
Answer. We do that all the time with for-
eign policy. We were holding the money at 
the same time for—what was it? The North-
ern Triangle countries. We were holding up 
aid to the Northern Triangle countries so 
that they would change their policies on im-
migration. By the way, and this speaks to an 
important—I’m sorry? This speaks to an im-
portant point, because I heard this yesterday 
and I can never remember the gentleman 
whose testimony—Was it McKinney, the 
guy—was that his name? I don’t know him. 
He testified yesterday. And if you go—and if 
you believe those reports—okay? Because 
we’ve not seen any transcripts of this. The 
only transcript I’ve seen was Sondland’s tes-
timony this morning. If you read the news 
reports and you believe them—what did 
McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney 
said yesterday that he was really upset with 
the political influence in foreign policy. 
That was one of the reasons he was so upset 
about this. And I have news for everybody: 
Get over it. There’s going to be political in-
fluence in foreign policy. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Is that 
what the Constitution requires—‘‘Get 
over it’’? Is that good enough for this 
body, the world’s greatest deliberative 
body—‘‘Get over it’’? 
The President’s counsel can try to 
emphasize Mr. Mulvaney and his attor-
neys’ efforts to walk back this state-
ment, but, as you have seen with your 
own eyes, the statement was unequivo-
cal. And even when given the chance in 
real time on that day, on October 17, to 
deny a quid pro quo, he doubled down. 
‘‘Get over it,’’ he said. 
But if you have any questions about 
what the real answer is and where the 
truth lies, there is only one way to find 
out: 
Let’s 
all 
just 
question 
Mr. 
Mulvaney under oath during the Sen-
ate trial. After all, counsel said that 
cross-examination was the greatest ve-
hicle in the history of American juris-
prudence ever invented to ascertain the 
truth—your standard. 
Finally, I would like to touch briefly 
on the importance of Mr. Blair and Mr. 
Duffey to this case. 
The President’s lawyers have argued 
that withholding foreign aid is entirely 
within his right as Commander in 
Chief; that this was a normal, ordinary 
decision; and that this is all just one 
big policy disagreement. 
We have proven exactly the opposite. 
This can’t be a policy disagreement be-
cause the President’s hold actually 
went against U.S. policy. The hold was 
undertaken outside of the normal 
channels by a President who, they 
admit, was not conducting policy. The 
hold was concealed not only from Con-
gress but from the President’s own offi-
cials responsible for Ukraine policy,

and, most importantly, the hold vio-
lated the law. 
The President has the right to make 
policy, but he does not have the right 
to break the law and coerce an ally 
into helping him cheat in our free and 
fair elections, and he doesn’t have a 
right to use hundreds of millions of 
dollars in taxpayer funds as leverage to 
get political dirt on an American cit-
izen who happens to be his political op-
ponent. 
But if you remain unsure about all of 
this, who better to ask than Mr. Blair 
or Mr. Duffey? They oversaw and exe-
cuted the process of withholding the 
aid. They can tell us exactly how unre-
lated to business as usual this whole 
shakedown scheme was when it was un-
derway. They can testify about why 
the aid was withheld and whether there 
was any legitimate explanation for 
withholding it. Some of you have asked 
that very question. 
Multiple officials—including Ambas-
sador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor, 
David 
Holmes, 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman, Jennifer Williams, and Mark 
Sandy—all testified that they were 
never given a credible explanation for 
the hold. So let’s ask Mr. Blair and 
let’s ask Mr. Duffey if this happens all 
the time, as Mick Mulvaney suggests. 
Why, at this time, in connection with 
this scheme, were all of those witnesses 
left in the dark? 
Despite the President’s refusal to 
produce a single document and to 
produce a shred of information in this 
impeachment inquiry undertaken in 
the 
House, 
his 
administration 
did 
produce 192 pages of Ukraine-related 
email records in Freedom of Informa-
tion Act lawsuits, albeit in heavily re-
dacted form. These documents confirm 
Mr. Duffey’s central role in executing 
the hold. He is on nearly every single 
impeachment 
release—nearly 
every 
single email. 
Here is an important email from that 
production. 
Just 90 minutes after the July 25 call, 
Mr. Duffey emailed officials at the De-
partment of Defense that they should 
‘‘hold off on any additional DOD obli-
gations of these funds.’’ Mr. Duffey 
added that the request was ‘‘sensitive’’ 
and that they should keep this infor-
mation ‘‘closely held.’’ The timing is 
important because if the aid wasn’t 
linked to the July 25 call and if it 
wasn’t 
related, 
why 
the 
sensitive, 
closely held request made within 2 
hours of that call? Let’s just ask Mr. 
Duffey. 
Mr. Duffey and Mr. Blair can testify 
about the concerns raised by DOD to 
the Office of Management and Budget 
about the illegality of the hold and 
why it remained in place even after 
DOD warned the administration that it 
would violate the Impoundment Con-
trol Act. 
Now, the President, of course, has 
disputed this fact, but we have dem-
onstrated that OMB was warned re-
peatedly by DOD officials of two 
things: first, continuing to withhold 
the aid would prevent the Department 
of Defense from spending the money 
before the end of the fiscal year, and 
second, the hold was potentially ille-
gal, as turned out to be the case. 
By August 9, DOD told Mr. Duffey di-
rectly that DOD—the Department of 
Defense—could no longer support the 
Office of Management and Budget’s 
claims that the hold would ‘‘not pre-
clude timely execution’’ of the aid for 
Ukraine, our vulnerable ally at war 
with Russian-backed separatists. Yet, 
as Mr. Duffey reportedly told Ms. 
McCusker at the Department of De-
fense on August 30, there was a ‘‘clear 
direction from POTUS to continue to 
hold’’—clear direction from the Presi-
dent of the United States to continue 
the hold. So how did Mr. Duffey under-
stand the ‘‘clear direction’’ to continue 
the hold? Why is the President claim-
ing that this wasn’t unlawful when 
DOD—the Department of Defense—re-
peatedly warned his administration 
that it was? Wouldn’t we all like to ask 
Mr. Duffey these questions? 
Finally, here is another reason why 
we know this was not business as 
usual. On July 29, Mr. Duffey—a polit-
ical appointee with zero relevant expe-
rience—abruptly seized responsibility 
for withholding the aid from Mark 
Sandy, a career Office of Management 
and Budget official—seized the respon-
sibility from a career official. Mr. 
Duffey provided no credible expla-
nation for that decision. 
Mr. Sandy testified that nothing like 
that had ever happened in his entire 
governmental career. Let’s think about 
that. If this is as routine as the Presi-
dent claims, why is a career official 
saying he has never seen anything like 
this happen before? Mr. Duffey knows 
why. Shouldn’t we just take the time 
to ask him? 
The American people deserve a fair 
trial. The Constitution deserves a fair 
trial. The President deserves a fair 
trial. A fair trial means witnesses. A 
fair trial means documents. A fair trial 
means evidence. No one is above the 
law. 
I yield to my distinguished colleague, 
Manager LOFGREN. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, it is not just 
about hearing from witnesses; you need 
documents. The documents don’t lie. 
There are specific documents relevant 
to this impeachment trial in the cus-
tody of the White House, OMB, DOD, 
and the State Department, and the 
President has hidden them from us. 
I am not going to go through each 
category again in detail, but here are 
some observations. 
This is, of course, an impeachment 
case against the President of the 
United States. Nothing could be more 
important. And the most important 
documents—documents 
that 
go 
di-
rectly to who knew what when—are 
being held by the executive branch. 
Many of these records are at the 
White House. The White House has 
records about the phone calls with 
President Zelensky, about scheduling 
an Oval Office meeting with President 
Zelensky, about the President’s deci-
sion to hold security assistance, about 
communications among his top aides, 
and about concerns raised by public of-
ficials with legal counsel. We have 
heard 
about 
Ambassador 
Bolton’s 
handwritten notes and book manu-
script 
and 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman’s Presidential policy memo-
randum. We know of reports about a 
number of emails in early August try-
ing to create after-the-fact justifica-
tions for the hold, but we haven’t seen 
any of them. They are at the White 
House being hidden by the President. I 
think it is a coverup. 
Documents are also at the State De-
partment, records about the recall of 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, 
about 
Giuliani’s efforts for the President, 
about concerns raised about the hold, 
about the Ukrainian reaction to the 
hold and when exactly they learned 
about it, and about negotiations with 
the Ukrainians for an Oval Office meet-
ing. We know about Ambassador Tay-
lor’s first-person cable and notes and 
Mr. Kent’s memos to file. We know 
about Mr. Sondland’s emails with 
Pompeo and Brechbuhl and Mulvaney 
and Perry, but we haven’t seen them. 
They are sitting in the State Depart-
ment. 
DOD and OMB also have records— 
records about President Trump’s hold 
on military aid to Ukraine, about the 
justification for the hold, about hiding 
the hold from Congress and trying to 
justify the hold after the fact, and 
about why the hold was lifted, but we 
haven’t seen them. They are at DOD 
and OMB. Why haven’t we seen them? 
Because the President directed all his 
agencies not to produce them. 
This trial should not reward the 
President’s really unprecedented ob-
struction by allowing him to control 
what evidence you see and what will 
remain hidden. You should ask for 
these documents on behalf of the 
American people, and you should ask 
for these documents to get the truth 
yourself. 
Now, let’s come back to the issue of 
delay, since the President’s lawyers 
have suggested that having witnesses 
and documents would make this trial 
take too long. There will be lengthy 
court battles, they say. The President 
might even invoke executive privilege 
for the very first time in this entire 
impeachment process. It would be bet-
ter, we are told, to skip straight to the 
final verdict, to break from centuries 
of precedent and end this trial without 
hearing from a single witness and with-
out reviewing a single document that 
the President ordered hidden. Respect-
fully, that shouldn’t happen. 
House managers aren’t interested in 
delaying these proceedings. We are in-
terested in the full truth; in a trial 
that is fair to the parties and to the 
American people; in the facts that the 
President’s counsel agrees are so crit-
ical to this trial. It is why we said we

won’t go to court; we will follow all the 
rulings of the Chief Justice. We can get 
the witness depositions done in a week. 
In fact, I know we can because if you, 
the Senators, order it, that is the law. 
You have the sole power to try im-
peachments. 
If questions or objections come up, 
including objections based on executive 
privilege, the Senate itself and the 
Chief Justice, in the first instance, can 
resolve them. We aren’t suggesting 
that the President waive executive 
privilege. We simply suggest that the 
Chief Justice can resolve issues related 
to any assertion of executive privilege. 
As the Supreme Court recognized in 
the case of Judge Walter Nixon, judges 
will stay out of disputes over how the 
Senate exercises its sole power to try 
impeachments. That ensures there will 
be no unnecessary delay, and it is why 
we propose we suspend the trial for 1 
week, and that during that time, you 
go back to business as usual. While the 
trial is suspended, we will take witness 
depositions and review the documents 
that are provided at your direction. 
The four witnesses you should hear 
from are readily available. Ambassador 
Bolton has already said he will appear. 
We can and would move quickly to de-
pose these witnesses within a week of 
the issuance of subpoenas. The docu-
ments, too, are ready to be produced. 
We are ready to review them quickly 
and to present additional evidence. 
Meanwhile, the Senate can continue 
going about its important legislative 
work, as it did during the depositions 
in the Clinton impeachment trial. 
The President’s opposition to this 
suggestion says a lot. The President is 
the architect of the very delay he 
warns against. He could easily avoid it. 
He could move things along. He could 
stop trying to silence witnesses and 
hide evidence. I think he is afraid the 
truth will come out. He hopes his 
threats of continued delay, however 
unjustified, will cause you to throw up 
your hands and give up on a fair trial. 
Please don’t give up. This is too impor-
tant for our democracy. 
A decision to forgo witnesses and 
documents at this trial would be a big 
departure from Senate precedent. When 
the Senate investigated Watergate, it 
heard from the highest White House of-
ficials. That happened because a bipar-
tisan majority of the Senate insisted. 
We got to the truth then because the 
Senate came together and put a fair 
proceeding above party loyalty. 
We should all want the truth, and so 
we ask you to do it again—that you put 
aside any politics, party loyalty. Be-
lieve in your President, which we un-
derstand and sympathize with, but sub-
poena the documents and the witnesses 
necessary to make this a fair trial, to 
hear and see the evidence you need to 
impartially administer justice. 
Now, there has been a lot of discus-
sion of executive privilege during this 
trial. Even if the President asserts ex-
ecutive privilege—something he has 
not yet done—it wouldn’t harm the 
President’s legal rights or cause undue 
delay. 
Here is why. Let’s focus on John 
Bolton, since this week’s revelations 
confirm the importance of his testi-
mony. 
First, as a private citizen, John 
Bolton is fully protected by the First 
Amendment if he wants to testify. 
There is no basis for imposing prior re-
straint for censoring him just because 
some of his testimony could include 
conversations with the President. That 
is commonplace. As long as his testi-
mony isn’t classified, it is shielded by 
the free speech clause of the First 
Amendment. 
Ambassador Bolton has written a 
book. It is inconceivable that he is for-
bidden from telling the U.S. Senate, 
sitting as a High Court of Impeach-
ment, information that shortly will be 
in print. 
If the President did attempt to in-
voke executive privilege, he would fail. 
It is true for separate reasons. First, 
claims of executive privilege always in-
volve a balancing of interests. The Su-
preme Court confirmed in U.S. v. 
Nixon—the Nixon tapes case—that ex-
ecutive privilege can be overcome by a 
need for evidence in a criminal trial. 
That is even more true here in an im-
peachment trial of the President of the 
United States, which is probably the 
most important interest under the 
Constitution. It would certainly out-
weigh any claim of privilege. 
Precedent confirms the point. To 
name just a few, National Security Ad-
visors for President Carter, Zbigniew 
Brzezinski; President Clinton, Samuel 
Berger; President George W. Bush, 
Condoleezza 
Rice; 
and 
President 
Obama, Susan Rice, testified in con-
gressional investigations. These advi-
sors discussed their communications 
with top government officials, includ-
ing the Presidents they served. There 
is no reason why all of these officials 
could testify in the normal course of 
events and hearings, but Ambassador 
Bolton, a former official, couldn’t tes-
tify in the most important trial there 
could possibly be. 
The second reason is the President 
waived any claim of executive privilege 
about Ambassador Bolton’s testimony. 
All 17 witnesses testified in the House 
about these matters without any asser-
tion of privilege by the President. 
President Trump, as well as his law-
yers and senior officials, have publicly 
discussed and tweeted about these 
issues at some length. The President 
has also directly denied reports about 
what Ambassador Bolton will say in 
his forthcoming book. Under these cir-
cumstances, the President cannot be 
allowed to tell his version of his story 
to the public while using executive 
privilege to silence a key witness who 
would contradict him. You shouldn’t 
let the President escape responsibility 
only to later see clearly what happened 
in Ambassador Bolton’s book. 
There are no national security risks 
here. The President has declassified the 
two 
phone 
calls 
with 
President 
Zelensky. All 17 witnesses testified 
about the President’s conduct regard-
ing Ukraine. We aren’t interested in 
asking about anything other than 
Ukraine. That is simply a bogus argu-
ment. 
The Constitution uses the words 
‘‘sole power’’ only twice: first, when it 
gives the House sole power to impeach; 
and, second, article 1, section 3, where 
it gives the Senate sole power to try 
impeachments. 
Here is what it says: 
The Senate shall have the sole Power to 
try all Impeachments. . . . When the Presi-
dent of the United States is tried, the Chief 
Justice shall preside. 
Now, I think that provision in the 
Constitution means something. It is up 
to the Senate to decide how to try this 
impeachment with fairness, with wit-
nesses, and documents. 
Privileges asserted can be decided 
using the process that you devise. That 
is not unconstitutional. It is what the 
Constitution provides. 
You have the power. You decide. 
Please decide for a fair trial that would 
yield the truth and serve our Constitu-
tion and the American people. 
I yield now to Manager SCHIFF. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, be-
fore we yield to counsel for the Presi-
dent, I would like to take a moment by 
talking about what I think is at stake 
here. A ‘‘no’’ vote on the question be-
fore you will have long-lasting and 
harmful consequences long after this 
impeachment trial is over. 
We agree with the President’s coun-
sel on this much: This will set a new 
precedent. This will be cited in im-
peachment trials from this point to the 
end of history. You can bet in every 
impeachment that follows, whether it 
is a Presidential impeachment or the 
impeachment of a judge, if that judge 
or President believes that it is to his or 
her advantage that there shall be a 
trial with no witnesses, they will cite 
the case of Donald J. Trump. They will 
make the argument that you can adju-
dicate the guilt or innocence of the 
party who is accused without hearing 
from a single witness, without review-
ing a single document. And I would 
submit that will be a very dangerous 
and long-lasting precedent that we will 
all have to live with. 
President Trump’s wholesale obstruc-
tion of Congress strikes at the heart of 
our Constitution and democratic sys-
tem of separation of powers. Make no 
mistake. The President’s actions in 
this impeachment inquiry constitute 
an attack on congressional oversight 
on the coequal nature of this branch of 
government, not just on the House but 
on the Senate’s ability, as well, to con-
duct its oversight, to serve as a check 
and balance on this President and 
every President that follows. 
If 
the 
Senate 
allows 
President 
Trump’s obstruction to stand, it effec-
tively 
nullifies 
the 
impeachment 
power. It will allow future Presidents 
to decide whether they want their mis-
conduct to be investigated or not,

whether they would like to participate 
in an impeachment investigation or 
not. That is a power of the Congress. 
That is not a power of the President. 
By permitting a categorical obstruc-
tion, it turns the impeachment power 
against itself. 
How we respond to this unprece-
dented obstruction will shape future 
debates between our branches of gov-
ernment and the executive forever. And 
it is not just impeachment. The ability 
of Congress to conduct meaningful and 
probing oversight—oversight that, by 
its nature, is intended to be a check 
and balance on the awesome powers of 
the executive branch—hinges on our 
willingness to call witnesses and com-
pel documents that President Trump is 
hiding with no valid justification, no 
precedential support. 
If we tell the President, effectively, 
‘‘You can act corruptly, you can abuse 
the powers of your office to coerce a 
foreign government to helping you 
cheat in an election by withholding 
military aid, and when you are caught, 
you can further abuse your powers by 
concealing the evidence of your wrong-
doing,’’ the President becomes unac-
countable to anyone. Our government 
is no longer a government with three 
coequal branches. The President effec-
tively, for all intents and purposes, be-
comes above the law. 
This is, of course, the opposite of 
what the Framers intended. They pur-
posely entrusted the power of impeach-
ment to the legislative branch so that 
it may protect the American people 
from a President who believes that he 
can do whatever he wants. 
So we must consider how our actions 
will reverberate for decades to come 
and the impact they will have on the 
functioning of our democracy. And as 
we consider this critical decision, it is 
important to remember that no matter 
what you decide to do here, whether 
you decide to hear witnesses and rel-
evant testimony, the facts will come 
out in the end. Even over the course of 
this trial, we have seen so many addi-
tional facts come to light. The facts 
will come out. In all of their horror, 
they will come out, and there are more 
court documents and deadlines under 
the Freedom of Information Act. Wit-
nesses will tell their stories in future 
congressional hearings, in books, and 
in the media. This week has made that 
abundantly clear. 
The documents the President is hid-
ing will come out. The witnesses the 
President is concealing will tell their 
stories. And we will be asked why we 
didn’t want to hear that information 
when we had the chance, when we 
could consider its relevance and impor-
tance in making this most serious deci-
sion. What answer shall we give if we 
do not pursue the truth now, if we 
allow it to remain hidden until it is too 
late to consider on the profound issue 
of the President’s innocence or guilt? 
What we are asking you to do on be-
half of the American people is simple: 
Use your sole power to try this im-
peachment by holding a fair trial. Get 
the documents they refuse to provide 
to the House. Hear the witnesses they 
refuse to make available to the House, 
just as this body has done in every sin-
gle impeachment trial until now. 
Let the American people know that 
you understand they deserve the truth. 
Let them know you still care about the 
truth, that the truth still matters. 
Though much divides us, on this we 
should agree: A trial, stripped of all its 
trappings, should be a search for the 
truth, and that requires witnesses and 
testimony. 
Now, you may have seen just this 
afternoon, the President’s former Chief 
of Staff, General Kelly, said ‘‘a Senate 
trial without witnesses is a job only 
half done.’’ A trial without witnesses is 
only half a trial. Well, I have to say I 
can’t agree. A trial without witnesses 
is no trial at all. You either have a 
trial or you don’t. And if you are going 
to have a real trial, you need to hear 
from the people who have firsthand in-
formation. Now, we have presented 
some of them to you, but you know as 
well as we there are others that you 
should hear from. 
Let me close this portion with words, 
I think, more powerful than General 
Kelly’s. They come from John Adams, 
who in 1776 wrote: Together with the 
right to vote, those who wrote our Con-
stitution considered the right to trial 
by jury ‘‘the heart and lungs, the main-
spring and the center wheel’’ of our lib-
erties, without which ‘‘the body must 
die, the watch must run down, the gov-
ernment must become arbitrary.’’ 
Now, what does that mean? Without 
a fair trial, the government must be-
come arbitrary. Now, of course, he is 
talking about the right of an average 
citizen to a trial by jury. 
Well, if in courtrooms all across 
America, when someone is tried but 
they are a person of influence and 
power, they can declare at the begin-
ning of the trial ‘‘If the government’s 
case is so good, let them prove it with-
out witnesses’’; if people of power and 
influence can insist to the judge that 
the House, that the prosecutors, that 
the government, that the people must 
prove their case without witnesses or 
documents, a right reserved only for 
the powerful—because, you know, only 
Donald Trump—only Donald Trump, of 
any defendant in America can insist on 
a trial with no witnesses—if that 
should be true in courts throughout the 
land, then, as Adams wrote, the gov-
ernment becomes arbitrary because 
whether you have a fair trial or no 
trial at all depends on whether you are 
a person of power and influence like 
Donald J. Trump. 
The body will die. The clock will run 
down. And our government becomes ar-
bitrary. The importance of a fair trial 
here is not less than in every court-
room in America; it is greater than in 
any courtroom in America because we 
set the example for America. 
I said at the outset, and I will repeat 
again: Your decision on guilt or inno-
cence is important, but it is not the 
most important decision. If we have a 
fair trial, however that trial turns out, 
whatever your verdict may be, at least 
we can agree we had a fair trial. At 
least we can agree that the House had 
a fair opportunity to present its case. 
At least we can agree that the Presi-
dent had a fair opportunity to present 
their case—if we have a fair trial. And 
we can disagree about the verdict, but 
we can all agree the system worked as 
it was intended. We had a fair trial, 
and we reached a decision. 
Rob this country of a fair trial, and 
there can be no representation that the 
verdict has any meaning. How could it, 
if the result is baked in by the process? 
Assure the American people, whatever 
the result may be, that at least they 
got a fair shake. 
There is a reason why the American 
people want to hear from witnesses, 
and it is not just about curiosity. It is 
because they recognize that in every 
courtroom in America that is just what 
happens. And if it doesn’t happen here, 
the government has become arbitrary; 
there is one person who is entitled to a 
different standard, and that is the 
President of the United States. And 
that is the last thing the Founders in-
tended. 
Mr. Chief Justice, we reserve the bal-
ance of our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The majority leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I request that the Senate take a 15- 
minute recess. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, so ordered. 
There being no objection, at 2:49 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 3:40 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Please be seat-
ed. 
We are ready to hear the presen-
tation from counsel for the President. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, the House 
managers have said throughout their 
presentation and throughout all of the 
proceedings here again and again that 
you can’t have a trial without wit-
nesses and documents, as if it is just 
that simple. If you are going to have a 
trial, there have to be new witnesses 
and documents. But it is not that sim-
ple. It is really a trope that is being 
used to disguise the real issues, the 
real decisions that you would be mak-
ing on this decision about witnesses, 
because there is a lot more at stake. 
Let me unpack that and explain what 
is really at stake there. 
The first is this idea that, if you 
come to trial, you have to always go to 
witnesses, have new witnesses come in, 
but that is not true. In every legal sys-
tem and in our legal systems on both 
the civil and criminal sides, there is a 
way to decide right up front, in some 
quick way, whether there is really a 
triable issue, whether you really need

to go to all the trouble of calling in 
new witnesses and having more evi-
dence in something like that. There is 
not here. There is no need for that be-
cause these Articles of Impeachment, 
on their face, are defective, and we 
have explained that. Let me start with 
the second article, the obstruction 
charge. 
We have explained that that charge 
is really trying to say that it is an im-
peachable offense for the President to 
defend the separation of powers. That 
can’t be right. It is also the case that 
no witnesses are going to say anything 
that makes any difference to the sec-
ond Article of Impeachment. That all 
has to do with the validity of the 
grounds the President asserted, the 
fact that he asserted longstanding con-
stitutional prerogatives of the execu-
tive branch in specific ways to resist 
specific deficiencies in the subpoenas 
that were issued. No fact witness is 
going to come in and say anything that 
relates in any way to that. It is not 
going to make any difference. 
On the first Article of Impeachment, 
that, too, is defective on its face. We 
have explained. We heard it again 
today here. They have this subjective 
theory of impeachment that will show 
abuse of power by focusing just on the 
President’s subjective motives, and 
they said again today, here, that the 
way they can show the President did 
something wrong is that he defied the 
foreign policy of the United States. I 
talked about that before, this theory 
that he defied the agencies within the 
executive branch. He wasn’t following 
the policy of the executive branch. 
That is not a constitutionally coherent 
statement. 
The theory of abuse of power that 
they have framed in the first Article of 
Impeachment will do grave damage to 
the separation of powers under our 
Constitution because it would become 
so malleable that they could pour into 
it anything they want to find illicit 
motives for some perfectly permissible 
action. It becomes so malleable that it 
is no different than maladministra-
tion—the exact ground that the Fram-
ers rejected during the Constitutional 
Convention. 
The Constitution defines specific of-
fenses. It limits and constrains the im-
peachment power. 
Now, there is also the fact that we 
actually heard from a lot of witnesses. 
We have heard from a lot of witnesses 
in the proceedings so far. You have 
heard 192 video clips, by our count, 
from 13 different witnesses. There were 
17 witnesses deposed in closed hearings 
in the House, and 12 of them testified 
again in open hearings. You have got 
all of those transcripts, so you can see 
the witnesses’ testimony there. The 
key portions have been played for you 
on the screens. And you have got over 
28,000 pages of documents and tran-
scripts. You have got a lot of evidence 
already. 
But there is another principle that 
they overlook when they say ‘‘Well, if 
you are going to have a trial, there just 
has to be witnesses,’’ as if the most or-
dinary thing is you get to trial and 
then start subpoenaing new witnesses 
and documents. That is not true either, 
and we pointed this out. 
In the regular courts, the way things 
work is you have got to do a lot of 
work preparing a trial—called dis-
covery—to find out about witnesses 
and depose them and find out about 
documents before you get to trial. You 
can’t show up the day of trial and say: 
Oh, Your Honor, actually, we are not 
ready. We didn’t subpoena John Bolton 
or witness X or witness Y, and now we 
want to subpoena that witness. Now we 
want to do discovery. 
And why does that matter here? Be-
cause here, to show up not having done 
the work and to expect that work to be 
done in the Senate, by this body, has 
grave consequences for the institu-
tional interests of this body, and it sets 
a precedent—really sets an important 
precedent for two bodies—for the Sen-
ate and for the House—because what 
the Senate accepts as an impeachment 
coming from the House determines not 
just precedent for the Senate but, real-
ly, precedent for the House in the fu-
ture as well. 
If the procedures used in the House 
to bring this proceeding here to this 
stage are accepted, if the Senate says 
‘‘Yes, we will start calling new wit-
nesses because you didn’t get the job 
done in whatever process you used to 
get it here,’’ then that becomes the 
new normal. And that is important in a 
couple of ways. 
One is, as we have pointed out, the 
totally unprecedented process that was 
used in the House that violated all no-
tions of due process. There are prece-
dents going back 150 years in the 
House, ensuring that someone accused 
in an impeachment hearing in the 
House has due process rights to be rep-
resented by counsel, to cross-examine 
witnesses, to be able to present evi-
dence. They didn’t allow the President 
to do that, and if this body says that is 
OK, then that becomes the new normal. 
And they stand up here, the House 
managers, and say this body will be un-
fair if this body doesn’t call the wit-
nesses. They talk about fairness. Where 
was the fairness in that proceeding in 
the House? 
And Manager SCHIFF says that things 
would be arbitrary if you don’t do what 
they said and call the witnesses they 
want. Well, wasn’t it arbitrary in the 
House when they wouldn’t allow the 
President to be represented by counsel, 
wouldn’t allow the President to call 
witnesses? There was no precedent in a 
Presidential impeachment inquiry to 
have open hearings where the Presi-
dent and his counsel were excluded. 
It also would set a precedent to allow 
a package, a proceeding, from the 
House to come here that the House 
managers say ‘‘Well, now we need new 
witnesses; we haven’t done all the 
work,’’ and it is witnesses they didn’t 
even try to get. They didn’t subpoena 
John 
Bolton, 
and 
they 
didn’t 
go 
through the process. When other wit-
nesses 
were 
subpoenaed—when 
Dr. 
Kupperman—Charlie Kupperman—went 
to court, they withdrew the subpoena. 
And now to say that ‘‘Well, fairness de-
mands that this body has to do all that 
work’’—that sets a new precedent, as 
well, and it changes—it would change 
for all of the future the relationship be-
tween the House and the Senate in im-
peachment inquiries. It would mean 
that the Senate has to become the in-
vestigatory body. 
And the principles that they assert— 
they did a process that wasn’t fair. 
They did a process that was arbitrary, 
that arbitrarily denied the President 
rights. 
They 
did 
a 
process 
that 
wouldn’t allow witnesses, and then 
they came here on the first night—re-
member when we were all here until 2 
o’clock—and in very belligerent terms 
said to the Members of this body: You 
are on trial. It will be treachery if you 
don’t do what the House managers say. 
That is not right. When it was their 
errors, when they were arbitrary and 
they didn’t provide fairness, they can’t 
project that onto this body to try to 
say that you have to make up for their 
errors, and if you don’t, the fault lies 
here. 
Now, they also suggest that it is not 
going to take a long time, that they 
only want a few witnesses. But, of 
course, if things are opened up to wit-
nesses and it is going to be fair, it is 
not just one side; it is not just the wit-
nesses that they would want. The 
President would have to be permitted 
to have witnesses. 
And with all respect, Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, the idea that if a subpoena is sent 
to a senior adviser to the President and 
the President determines that he will 
stand by the principle of immunity 
that has been asserted by virtually 
every President since Nixon, that that 
will just be resolved by the Senate 
right here, whether or not that privi-
lege exists, by the Chief Justice sitting 
as the Presiding Officer—that doesn’t 
make sense. That is not the way it 
works. 
The Senate, even when the Chief Jus-
tice is the Presiding Officer here, can’t 
unilaterally decide the privileges of the 
executive branch. That dispute would 
have to be resolved in another way, and 
it could involve litigation, and it could 
take a lot of time. 
So the idea that this will all be done 
quickly if everyone just does what the 
House managers say is not realistic. It 
is not the way that the process would 
actually have to play out in accord 
with the Constitution, and that has an-
other significant consequence, again 
affecting this institution as a prece-
dent going forward because what it 
suggests—the new normal that would 
be created then—is kind of an express 
path for precisely the sort of impeach-
ment that the Framers most feared. 
The Framers recognized that im-
peachments could be done for illegit-
imate reasons. They recognized that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S763 
January 31, 2020 
there could be partisan impeachments. 
And if this is the new normal, this is 
the very epitome of a partisan im-
peachment. There was bipartisan oppo-
sition to it in the House, and it was 
rushed through with unfair proce-
dures—78 days total of inquiry. Think 
about that. In Nixon there had been in-
vestigating committees, and there was 
a special prosecutor long before the 
House Judiciary Committee started its 
investigation. 
In Clinton there was a special coun-
sel—an independent counsel for the 
better part of a year before the House 
Judiciary 
Committee 
even 
started 
hearings. 
Everything from start to finish in 
this case, from September 24 until the 
Articles of Impeachment were consid-
ered in the Judiciary Committee, was 
done in 78 days—in 78 days—and for 71 
of them, the President was entirely 
locked out. 
So 
the 
new 
normal 
would 
be 
slapdash: Get it done quickly, unfair 
procedures in the House to impeach a 
President; then bring it to the Senate, 
and then all the real work of investiga-
tion and discovery is going to have to 
take place with that impeachment 
hanging over the President’s head, and 
that is a particular thing the Framers 
also were concerned about. I mentioned 
this the other day. 
In Federalist No. 65 Hamilton warned 
specifically about what he called—I am 
quoting—‘‘the injury to the innocent, 
from the procrastinated determination 
of the charges which might be brought 
against them’’ because he understood 
that if an impeachment charge from 
the House wasn’t resolved quickly, if it 
was hanging over the President’s head, 
that in itself would be a problem. And 
that is why they structured the im-
peachment process so that the Senate 
could be able to swiftly determine im-
peachments that were brought. That 
also suggests that is why there is a sys-
tem for having thorough investiga-
tions, a thorough process done in the 
House. 
And Hamilton explained that delay 
after the impeachment would afford an 
opportunity for ‘‘intrigue and corrup-
tion,’’ and it would also be, as he put 
it, ‘‘the detriment to the State, from 
the prolonged inaction of men whose 
firm and faithful execution of their 
duty might have exposed them to the 
persecution of an intemperate or de-
signing majority in the House of Rep-
resentatives.’’ And that is what has 
happened here. 
And if you create a system now that 
makes the new normal a half-baked, 
slapdash process in the House—just get 
the impeachment done and get it over 
to the Senate—and then once the 
President is impeached and you have 
the head of the executive branch, the 
leader of the free world, having some-
thing like that hanging over his head, 
then we will slow everything down, and 
then we will start doing the investiga-
tion and just drag it out. That is all 
part of what makes this even more po-
litical, especially in an election year. 
It is not the process that the Framers 
had in mind, and it is not something 
the Senate should condone in this case. 
The Senate is not here to do the inves-
tigatory work that the House didn’t do. 
Where there has been a process that 
denied all due process, that produced a 
record that can’t be relied upon, the re-
action from this body should be to re-
ject the Articles of Impeachment, not 
to condone and put its imprimatur on 
the way the proceedings were handled 
in the House and not to prolong mat-
ters further by trying to redo work 
that the House failed to do by not seek-
ing evidence and not doing a fair and 
legitimate process to bring the Articles 
of Impeachment here. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, over a 
7-day period you did hear evidence. You 
heard evidence from 13 different wit-
nesses, 192 video clips, and as my col-
league the Deputy White House Coun-
sel said, over 28,000 pages of documents. 
You heard testimony from Gordon 
Sondland. He is the United States Am-
bassador to the European Union. You 
heard that testimony. He testified in 
the House proceedings. I did not have 
an opportunity to cross-examine him. 
If we get witnesses, I have to have that 
opportunity. 
William 
Taylor, 
former 
Acting 
United States Ambassador to Ukraine, 
testified. You heard his testimony. We 
didn’t get the opportunity to cross-ex-
amine him. He would be called. 
Tim Morrison, the former senior di-
rector for Europe and Russia of the Na-
tional Security Council. You saw his 
testimony. They put it up. We didn’t 
get an opportunity—we did not have an 
opportunity to cross-examine him. 
Jennifer Williams, special adviser on 
Europe and Russia for Vice President 
MIKE PENCE. You saw her testimony. 
They put it up. I did not have the op-
portunity to cross-examine her. If we 
call witnesses, we would have to have 
that opportunity. 
David Holmes, political counsel to 
the United States Embassy in Ukraine. 
You saw testimony from him. We were 
not able to cross-examine him. If he is 
called or if we get witnesses, we will 
call the Ambassador, and we will cross- 
examine. 
LTC Alexander Vindman. You saw 
his testimony. He appeared before the 
House. We didn’t have the opportunity 
to cross-examine him. If we call wit-
nesses, we will, of course, have that 
right to cross-examine him. 
Fiona Hill. She is the former senior 
director for Europe and Russia on the 
National Security Council. She testi-
fied for the House. If we have wit-
nesses, we have the opportunity to call 
her then and cross-examine Fiona Hill. 
Kurt Volker, former United States 
Representative for Ukraine Negotia-
tions. They called him; we did not have 
the opportunity to cross-examine. If we 
are calling witnesses—these are wit-
nesses you have heard from—we would 
have the right to call witnesses and to 
cross-examine 
Mr. 
Volker. 
George 
Kent, the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of State for the Bureau of European 
and Eurasian Affairs, you saw his testi-
mony. They called him. If we have wit-
nesses, we have the right to call that 
witness and to cross-examine Deputy 
Assistant Secretary Kent. 
The former United States Ambas-
sador 
to 
Ukraine, 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, they called her. You saw 
that testimony. We did not have the 
opportunity to cross-examine her. If we 
have witnesses, we would have to call 
her. 
Laura Cooper, Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, 
and Eurasia, they called her. You saw 
her witness testimony right here. We 
did not have the opportunity to cross- 
examine her. We would have to be 
given that opportunity. 
These are the witnesses against the 
President. Laura Cooper, Deputy Sec-
retary of Defense for Russia and Eur-
asia—again, the same thing. 
David Hale, the Under Secretary of 
State for Political Affairs. He was 
called by the House. You saw his testi-
mony. We never had the opportunity to 
cross-examine him. If we have wit-
nesses, we have to have the oppor-
tunity to do that. 
There were other witnesses that were 
called where you saw their testimony 
or heard their testimony or it was re-
ferred to. Catherine Croft, Special Ad-
viser for Ukraine negotiation, Depart-
ment of State; Mark Sandy, the Dep-
uty Associate Director for National Se-
curity Programs; and Christopher An-
derson, Special Adviser for Ukraine Ne-
gotiations, Department of State—you 
heard their testimony referred to. We 
did not have the opportunity to cross- 
examine them. 
So this isn’t going to happen, if wit-
nesses are called in a week. Now, that 
is just the witnesses that have been 
produced that you have seen by the 
House managers. 
You are being called upon to make 
consequential 
constitutional 
deci-
sions—consequential decisions for our 
Constitution. We talked about the bur-
den of proof. I said this before, and I 
will say it again. Thirty-one times the 
managers said they proved their case. 
Twenty-nine times they said the evi-
dence 
was 
overwhelming. 
Manager 
NADLER—he didn’t only say it was 
overwhelming in his view, on page 739 
of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, he is 
very clear. He says not only is it 
strong, there is no doubt. That is what 
he said. ‘‘The one thing the House man-
agers think the President counsel got 
right is quoting me’’—talking about 
Mr. NADLER, Manager NADLER—‘‘as 
saying ‘beyond any doubt.’ It is, in-
deed, beyond any doubt.’’ 
Now, of course, we think that they 
have not proven their case by any 
stretch of any proper constitutional 
analysis. 
In the Clinton investigation, they 
talk about witnesses being called, but

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S764 
January 31, 2020 
the three witnesses that were called 
had either testified before the grand 
jury or before the House committee. 
There weren’t new witnesses. What Mr. 
Philbin said is correct; that under our 
constitutional design, they are sup-
posed to investigate; you are to delib-
erate. But what they are asking you to 
do is now become the investigative 
agency, the investigative body. 
If they needed all this additional evi-
dence, which they said they don’t 
need—and, by the way, not only did 
they say it in the RECORD, this is House 
Manager NADLER when he was on CNN 
back on the 15th of this month: ‘‘We 
brought the articles of impeachment. 
Because, despite the fact that we didn’t 
hear from many witnesses we [could] 
have heard from, we heard from enough 
witnesses to prove the case beyond any 
doubt at all.’’ 
The same can be said from Rep-
resentative LOFGREN: 
You know, we have evidence proving the 
case through, for example, at the meeting 
when Bolton said it was a drug deal, well, we 
have fact witnesses. Hill was there, Vindman 
was there, Sondland was there. 
So this idea that they haven’t had 
witnesses, that is the smoke screen. 
You have heard from a lot of witnesses. 
The problem with the case, the prob-
lem with their position is, even with 
all of those witnesses, it doesn’t prove 
up an impeachable offense. The articles 
fail. 
I think it is very dangerous if the 
House runs up—which they did—Arti-
cles of Impeachment quickly, so quick-
ly that they are clamoring for evi-
dence, despite the fact that they put 
all of this evidence forward. They got 
their wish of an impeachment by 
Christmas. That was the goal. But now 
they want you to do the work they 
failed to do. 
But, as I said, time and time again 
we heard: You didn’t hear from wit-
nesses. You didn’t hear from many wit-
nesses. Mr. SCHIFF modified that a lit-
tle bit today, a little bit. You heard 
from a lot of witnesses. But if we go 
down the road of witnesses, this is not 
a 1-week process. Remember, I talked 
about the waving the wand and Ukrain-
ian corruption was gone? You are not 
going to have a witness wand here, 
where, OK, you got a week to do this 
and get it done. There is no way that 
would be proper under due process. 
But, you know, due process is supposed 
to be for the person accused, and they 
are turning it on its head. They 
brought the articles before you. They 
are the ones that rushed the case up 
and then held it before you could actu-
ally start proceeding, but they are the 
ones who passed the articles before 
Christmas. 
You know, we talked a lot about the 
court system and the fact that they 
were seeking witnesses, and when it 
got close to actually having a court 
proceeding, they decided that they 
didn’t want to have that witness go 
through that proceeding, and they ac-
tually withdrew the subpoena to move 
the case out. 
How many constitutional challenges 
will we have in this body because they 
placed the burden on you that they 
would not take themselves in putting 
their case forward? If we look at our 
constitutional framework and our con-
stitutional structure, that is not the 
way it is supposed to work. 
Now, our opposition to this motion is 
rather straightforward, as I have said. 
We came here ready to try the case on 
the record that they presented, the 
record that the managers told us was 
overwhelming and complete. 
Mr. SCHIFF went through every sen-
tence of the Articles of Impeachment 
just a few days ago and said: Proved, 
proved, proved. But the problem is that 
what is proved, proved, proved is not 
an impeachable offense. You could 
have witnesses that prove a lot of 
things, but if there is not a violation of 
the law, if it doesn’t meet the constitu-
tional required process, the constitu-
tional required substantive issues of do 
these articles—these allegations rise to 
the level sufficient for a removal of of-
fice for a duly elected President of the 
United States? It doesn’t and espe-
cially so—especially so—when we are 
in an election year. 
I am not going to take the time— 
your time, which is precious, to go over 
each and every allegation about wit-
nesses that I can. I could do it. I could 
stand here for a long time. I am not 
going to do that. I am just going to say 
this: They created the record. Do not 
allow them to penalize the country and 
the Constitution because they failed to 
do their job. 
With that Mr. Chief Justice, we yield 
our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The House managers have 30 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice, Senators: I want to 
walk through some of the arguments 
that you just heard from the Presi-
dent’s counsel. 
The first argument was made by Mr. 
Philbin. Mr. Philbin began by saying 
the House managers assert that you 
can’t have a trial without witnesses, 
and he said: ‘‘It’s not that simple.’’ Ac-
tually, it is. It is pretty simple. It is 
pretty simple. In every courthouse, in 
every State, in every county in the 
country, where they have trials, they 
have witnesses. And I think you heard 
Mr. Philbin tie himself into knots as to 
why this should be the first trial in 
which witnesses are not necessary. 
But, you know, some things are just as 
simple as they appear. A trial without 
witnesses is simply not a trial. You 
could call it something else, but it is 
not a trial. 
Now, Mr. Sekulow said something 
very interesting. He said: The House 
investigates, and the Senate delib-
erates. Well, he would rewrite our Con-
stitution with that argument because 
the last time I checked the Constitu-
tion, it said that the House shall have 
the sole power of impeachment, and 
the Senate shall try the impeachment, 
not merely deliberate about it, not 
merely think about it, not merely won-
der about it. I know you are the great-
est deliberative body in the world, but 
not even you can deliberate in a trial 
without witnesses. But Mr. Sekulow 
would rewrite the Constitution: Your 
job is not to try the case, he says; your 
job is merely to deliberate. That is not 
what the Founders had in mind—not by 
a long shot. 
Now, Mr. Philbin says none of these 
witnesses would have relevance on arti-
cle II—I guess conceding that they 
would have relevant evidence under ar-
ticle I. But that is not true either. 
Imagine what you will see when you 
hear from the witnesses who ran the 
Office of Management and Budget or 
imagine what you will see when you 
read the documents from the Office of 
Management and Budget. What you 
will see is what they have covered up. 
What you will see is the motive for 
their complete obstruction of Congress. 
When you see not the redacted emails, 
not the fully blacked-out emails that 
they deigned to give in the litigation 
and Freedom of Information Act, but 
when you see what is under those 
redactions, you will have proof of mo-
tive. When you see those documents, 
you will see just how fallacious these 
nonassertions of executive privilege 
are. You will see, in essence, what they 
have covered up. It could not be more 
relevant to whether their panoply of 
legal argumentation to justify ‘‘we 
shall fight all subpoenas’’ is merely a 
coverup in a legal window dressing. So 
these witnesses and documents are 
critical on both articles. 
Now, you also heard Mr. Philbin 
argue—and, again, this is where we ex-
pected we would be at the end of the 
proceeding, which is, essentially, they 
proved their case. They proved their 
case. We pretty much all know what 
has gone on here. We all understand 
just what this President did. No one 
really disputes that anymore. So what? 
So what? It is a version of the 
Dershowitz defense. So what? The 
President can do no wrong. The Presi-
dent is the State. If the President be-
lieves that corrupt conduct would help 
him get reelected, if he believes shak-
ing down an ally and withholding mili-
tary aid, if he believes soliciting for-
eign 
interference 
in 
our 
election, 
whether it be from the Ukrainians or 
the Russians or the Israeli Prime Min-
ister or anyone else in any form it may 
take, so what? He has a God-given 
right to abuse his power, and there is 
nothing you can do about it. It is the 
Dershowitz principle of constitutional 
lawlessness. That is the end-all argu-
ment for them. You don’t need to hear 
witnesses who will prove the Presi-
dent’s misconduct because he has a 
right to be as corrupt as he chooses 
under our Constitution, and there is 
nothing you can do about it. God help 
us if that argument succeeds. 
Now, they say that these witnesses 
already testified, and so you don’t need

January 31, 2020 
to hear from anybody. There are wit-
nesses who already testified, so the 
House doesn’t get to call witnesses in 
the Senate. That would be like a crimi-
nal trial in any courthouse in America 
where the defendant, if he’s rich and 
powerful enough, can say to the judge: 
Hey, Judge, the prosecution got to 
have witnesses in the grand jury. They 
don’t get to call anyone here. They had 
their chance in the grand jury. They 
called witnesses in the grand jury. 
They don’t get to call witnesses here. 
That is not how it works in any 
courtroom in America, and it is not 
how it should work in this courtroom. 
Of course, you heard the argument 
again repeated time and time again: 
The House is saying they are not ready 
for trial. Of course, we never said we 
weren’t ready for trial. We came here 
very prepared for trial. I would submit 
to you, the President’s team came here 
unprepared for trial, unprepared for the 
fact that there would be, as we all an-
ticipated, a daily drip of new disclo-
sures that would send them back on 
their heels. We came here to try a 
case—prepared to try a case—and, yes, 
we had, I hope, the not unreasonable 
expectation that in trying that case, 
like in every courtroom in America, we 
could call witnesses. That is not a lack 
of preparation. That is the presence of 
common sense. 
They didn’t try to get Bolton, they 
argue. Someone said: They didn’t even 
try to get Bolton. 
Now, of course, we did try to get 
Bolton, and what he said when he re-
fused to show up voluntarily is: If you 
subpoena me, I will sue you. I will sue 
you. 
He said basically what Don McGahn 
told us 9 months ago: I will sue you; 
good luck with that. 
Now, the public argument that was 
made by his counsel was that he and 
Dr. Kupperman, out of, you know, just 
due diligence, they just want a court to 
opine that it is OK for them to come 
forward and testify. As soon as the 
court blesses their testimony, they are 
more than willing to come in. They 
just are going to court to get a court 
opinion saying they can do it. 
And so, of course, we said to them: If 
that is your real motivation, there is a 
court about to rule on this very issue 
of absolute immunity. 
And very shortly thereafter, that 
court did. That was the court—Judge 
Jackson in the McGahn case—and the 
judge said that his argument about ab-
solute immunity—which, yes, Presi-
dents have always dreamed about and 
asserted but which has never succeeded 
in any court in the land—it was ridi-
culed in the case of Harriet Miers. It 
was made short shrift in the case of 
Don McGahn, where the judge said: No, 
we don’t have Kings here. In the 250 
years of jurisprudence, there is not a 
single case to support the proposition 
that the President can simply say that 
my advisers are absolutely immune 
from process. 
And, of course, in every other non-
impeachment context where the courts 
have looked at the issue of a Congress’s 
power to enforce subpoenas against 
witnesses or documents, the courts 
have said the power to compel compli-
ance with a subpoena is coequal and co-
extensive with the power to legislate 
because you can’t do one without the 
other. If we can’t find out whether the 
President is breaking the law, vio-
lating the Impoundment Control Act or 
any other—whether he is withholding 
aid that we appropriated for an ally— 
how can we legislate a fix to make sure 
that this never happens again? We 
can’t. If we can’t get answers, we can’t 
legislate. 
That is a proposition indicated by 
every court in the land. And, of course, 
in the context of impeachment, the 
courts have said that is never more im-
portant—never more important. 
Now, I don’t know why, after saying 
he would sue us—and we had to expect 
that, like Don McGahn, where we are 
still in court 9 months later. I don’t 
know why he changed his mind, but I 
suspect it is for the reason that if this 
trial goes forward and he keeps this to 
himself, it will be very difficult to ex-
plain to the country why he saved it 
for the book. When he knew informa-
tion of direct relevance and con-
sequence to a decision that you have to 
make about whether the President of 
the United States should be removed 
from office, it would be very difficult 
to explain why that is saved for a book. 
Well, I would submit to you, it would 
be equally difficult for you to explain 
as it would be for him. But you can ask 
him that question: Why are you willing 
to testify before the Senate but not the 
House? And you should ask him that 
question. 
Now, it was said, and it has the char-
acter of ‘‘you should have fought hard-
er to overcome our obstruction.’’ The 
House should have fought harder to 
overcome our stonewalling. Shame on 
the House for not fighting harder to 
overcome our stonewalling. If only 
they had fought harder to overcome 
our stonewalling, maybe they could 
have gotten these witnesses earlier. 
That is a really hard argument to 
make while they are stonewalling: You 
should have tried harder. You should 
have taken the years that would be 
necessary 
to 
overcome 
our 
stonewalling. 
And the reason why that argument is 
in such bad faith? As I pointed out to 
you yesterday, while they are in this 
body arguing the House was derelict, 
slapdash, they should have fought 
harder and longer and endlessly to 
overcome our stonewalling—while they 
are making that argument to you that 
the House should have fought up and 
down the courts from the district to 
the court of appeals to the Supreme 
Court and back again—they are in the 
courthouse arguing the opposite. They 
are in the courthouse saying: Judge, 
they are trying to enforce a subpoena 
on Don McGahn. You need to throw it 
out. They don’t have the jurisdiction. 
This is nonjusticiable. You can’t hear 
this case. 
That is a really hard argument to 
make. I credit them for making it with 
a straight face, but that is the char-
acter of it: You should have fought 
harder to overcome our stonewalling 
and obstruction. 
Now, they also say the Chief Justice 
cannot decide issues of privilege. No, 
the Chief Justice can’t make those de-
cisions. You need to let us litigate this 
up and down the court system. 
That is a pretty remarkable argu-
ment because the Senate rules allow 
the presiding officer to make judg-
ments and to rule on issues of evidence, 
materiality, and privilege. That is per-
mitted under your own rules. We don’t 
need to go up and down the courts. We 
have got a perfectly good judge right 
here. 
Now, you heard our proposal yester-
day that we take a week—just a week— 
to depose the witnesses that we feel are 
relevant, that they feel are relevant, 
and that the Justice rules are rel-
evant—just one week. Now, they can 
say that the Constitution requires 
them to go to court, but, of course, it 
doesn’t. There is absolutely no con-
stitutional impediment from these fine 
lawyers saying: You know, that is emi-
nently reasonable. We will allow a neu-
tral party, the Chief Justice of the 
United States of America, to rule on 
whether a witness is material or imma-
terial, whether they have been called 
for purposes of probative evidence or 
harassment, and whether you are mak-
ing a proper claim of privilege or mere-
ly trying to hide crime or fraud. 
The concern they have is not that the 
Chief Justice will be unfair, but rather 
that he will be fair. But do not make 
any mistake about it. Do not let them 
suggest that there is something con-
stitutionally impermissible or it would 
violate the President’s rights to allow 
the Chief Justice of the United States 
to make those decisions in this court, 
because he is empowered to do so by 
your rules and by the Constitution, 
which gives you the sole power to try 
impeachments. In the sole exercise of 
your power to try impeachments, you 
can say: We will allow the Chief Jus-
tice to make those decisions. 
Now, Mr. Sekulow said that you have 
heard the testimony of 13 witnesses. 
And I think the impression is meant to 
be given, if not to you—we know other-
wise—maybe the people watching at 
home, that they must have been in be-
tween errands while watching the Sen-
ate trial and missed where those 13 wit-
nesses came before the Senate and tes-
tified. 
But of course, you heard no live tes-
timony in this body. There wasn’t any 
live testimony before this body, and I 
don’t recall any of you in that super-
secret basement bunker they have been 
talking about. Now, I will admit, there 
were 100 Members eligible to be there. 
So maybe I missed one of you, but I 
don’t think you were there for the live 
testimony in the House. 
Now, Mr. Sekulow says the President 
was deprived of his right of calling

these witnesses himself and cross-ex-
amining these witnesses in the House, 
but that is not true either because the 
President was eligible to call witnesses 
in his defense in the Judiciary Com-
mittee and chose not to do so. If the 
President’s 
counsel 
felt 
that, 
you 
know, Bill Taylor says that he spoke 
with Sondland right after this phone 
call with the President, and Sondland 
talked about how the military aid was 
conditioned on these investigations, 
the President wanted Zelensky in a 
public box, and I would really like to 
cross-examine that West Point grad 
and Vietnam vet because I don’t be-
lieve him, you know, they could have 
called Bill Taylor in the Judiciary 
Committee and cross-examined him, or 
they could have called Mick Mulvaney 
and put him under oath and let him 
contradict what we know John Bolton 
would say. But of course, they didn’t do 
that. No, they said merely: Just get it 
over with in the House. For all there, it 
was too quick, too slapdash. Get it over 
with in the House, because, as the 
President said, when it comes to the 
Senate, we will have a real trial where 
he gets to call witnesses. But they have 
changed their tune because now they 
know what they have really known all 
along; which is, that those witnesses 
would deeply incriminate this Presi-
dent. 
So, instead, they have fallen back on 
the argument that if we are going to go 
down the road to having a real trial, if 
we are going to go down the road in 
having a real trial, we, the President’s 
lawyers, are going to make you pay. 
And the form of this argument is: We 
are going to call every witness under 
the Sun. We are going to call every 
witness that testified before the House. 
We are going to call every witness that 
we can think of that would help smear 
the Bidens. We are going to keep you 
here until kingdom come. That is es-
sentially the argument that they are 
making when Mr. Sekulow says: We are 
going to bring in Fiona Hill, and we are 
going to bring in Tim Morrison, and we 
are going to bring in this witness and 
bring in that witness. 
You have the sole power to try this 
case. You do not have to allow the 
President’s lawyers to abuse your time 
or this process. You have the power to 
decide: No, we gave each side 24 hours 
to make their arguments. We are going 
to give each side a shared week to call 
their witnesses. You have that power. 
If you didn’t, you couldn’t have con-
stricted the amount of time for our ar-
gument. You can likewise determine 
how much time should be taken with 
witness testimony. 
Now, Mr. Sekulow ended his argu-
ment against witnesses with where Mr. 
Philbin essentially began. It all comes 
back to the Dershowitz principle. What 
is the point of witnesses if the Presi-
dent can do whatever he wants under 
article II? What is the point of calling 
witnesses? What is the point of having 
a trial if the President can do whatever 
he wants under article II? 
The only constraining principle—and 
I think that one of the Senators asked 
yesterday: What is the limiting prin-
ciple in the Dershowitz argument? If a 
President can corruptly seek foreign 
interference in his election because he 
believes that his election is in the na-
tional interest, then, you cannot im-
peach him for it, no matter how dam-
aging it may be to our national secu-
rity. What is the limiting principle? 
And I suppose the limiting principle 
is only this: It only requires the Presi-
dent to believe that his reelection is in 
the national interest. Well, it would re-
quire an extraordinary level of self-re-
flection and insight for a President of 
the United States to conclude that his 
own reelection was not in the national 
interest—not unprecedented, mind you. 
I think that was the decision that LBJ 
ultimately arrived at, but I would not 
want to consider that a meaningful 
limitation on Presidential power, and 
neither should you. 
Finally, 
counsel 
expressed 
some 
indignance—indignance—that 
we 
should suggest that it is not just the 
Senate—it is not just the President, 
rather, who is on trial here but it is 
also the Senate; how dare the House 
managers suggest that your decision 
should reflect on this body. That is just 
such a calumny. 
Well, let me read you a statement 
made by one of your colleagues. This is 
what former U.S. Senator John War-
ner, a Republican of Virginia, had to 
say: 
As conscientious citizens from all walks of 
life are trying their best to understand the 
complex impeachment issues now being de-
liberated in the U.S. Senate, the rules of evi-
dence are central to the matter. Should the 
Senate allow additional sworn testimony 
from fact witnesses with firsthand knowl-
edge and include relevant documents? 
As a lifelong Republican and a retired 
member of the U.S. Senate, who once served 
as a juror in a Presidential impeachment 
trial, I am mindful of the difficult respon-
sibilities those currently serving now shoul-
der. I believe, as I am sure you do, that not 
only is the President on trial, but in many 
ways, so is the Senate itself. As such, I am 
strongly supportive of the efforts of my 
former Republican Senate colleagues who 
are considering that the Senate accept the 
introduction of additional evidence that they 
deem relevant. 
Not long ago Senators of both major par-
ties always worked to accommodate fellow 
colleagues with differing points of view to 
arrive at outcomes that would best serve the 
nation’s interests. If witnesses are sup-
pressed in this trial and a majority of Ameri-
cans are left believing the trial was a sham, 
I can only imagine the lasting damage done 
to the Senate, and to our fragile national 
consensus. The Senate embraces its legacy 
and delivers for the American people by 
avoiding the risk. 
Throughout the long life of our nation, fed-
eral and state judicial systems have largely 
supported the judicial norms of evidence, 
witnesses and relevant documents. I respect-
fully urge the Senate to be guided by the 
rules of evidence and follow our nation’s ju-
dicial norms, precedents and institutions to 
uphold the Constitution and the rule of law 
by welcoming relevant witnesses and docu-
ments as part of this impeachment trial. 
That is your colleague, former Sen-
ator John Warner. 
Senators, there is a storm blowing 
through this Capitol. Its winds are 
strong, and they move us in uncertain 
and dangerous directions. 
Jefferson once said: ‘‘I consider trial 
by jury as the only anchor . . . yet 
imagined by man, by which a govern-
ment can be held to the principles of 
its constitution’’—the only anchor yet 
imagined by man by which a govern-
ment can be held to the principles of 
its constitution. I would submit to you, 
remove that anchor, and we are adrift, 
but if we hold true, if we have faith 
that the ship of state can survive the 
truth, this storm shall pass. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
the Democratic leader and I have had 
an opportunity to have a discussion, 
and it leads to the following: We will 
now cast a vote on the witness ques-
tion. 
Once that vote is complete, I would 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate stand in recess subject to the call 
of the Chair. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Shall it be in order 
to consider and debate under the im-
peachment rules any motion to sub-
poena witnesses or documents? 
The yeas and nays are required under 
S. Res. 483. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

Senators in the Chamber wising to

RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Under the pre-
vious order, the Senate stands in recess 
subject to the call of the Chair. 
Thereupon, at 5:42 p.m., the Senate, 
sitting as a Court of Impeachment, re-
cessed until 7:13 p.m.; whereupon the 
Senate reassembled when called to 
order by the CHIEF JUSTICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will come to order. The majority leader 
is recognized. 
PROVIDING
FOR
RELATED
PROCEDURES
CON-
CERNING
THE
ARTICLES
OF
IMPEACHMENT 
AGAINST DONALD JOHN TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I send a resolution to the desk, and I 
ask the clerk to report. 
Mr. CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
report the resolution by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 488) to provide for re-
lated procedures concerning the articles of 
impeachment against Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States. 
Resolved, That the record in this case shall 
be closed, and no motion with respect to re-
opening the record shall be in order for the 
duration of these proceedings. 
The Senate shall proceed to final argu-
ments as provided in the impeachment rules, 
waiving the two person rule contained in 
Rule XXII of the Rules of Procedure and 
Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Im-
peachment Trials. Such arguments shall 
begin at 11:00 am on Monday, February 3, 
2020, and not exceed four hours, and be equal-
ly divided between the House and the Presi-
dent to be used as under the Rules of Im-
peachment. 
At the conclusion of the final arguments 
by the House and the President, the court of 
impeachment shall stand adjourned until 4:00 
pm on Wednesday, February 5, 2020, at which 
time the Senate, without intervening action 
or debate shall vote on the Articles of Im-
peachment. 
Thereupon, the Senate, sitting as a 
Court of Impeachment, proceeded to 
consider the resolution. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Democratic leader or designee be al-
lowed to offer up four amendments to 
the resolution; further, that I be recog-
nized to make a motion to table the 
amendment after it has been reported 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objec-
tion? Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
have a parliamentary inquiry. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Demo-
cratic leader will state the inquiry. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Is the Chief Justice 
aware that in the impeachment trial of 
President 
Johnson, 
Chief 
Justice 
Chase, as Presiding Officer, cast tie- 
breaking votes on both March 31 and 
April 2, 1868? 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. I am, Mr. 
Leader. The one concerned a motion to 
adjourn. The other concerned a motion 
to close deliberations. I do not regard 
those isolated episodes 150 years ago as 
sufficient to support a general author-
ity to break ties. 
If the Members of this body, elected 
by the people and accountable to them, 
divide equally on a motion, the normal 
rule is that the motion fails. 
I think it would be inappropriate for 
me, an unelected official from a dif-
ferent branch of government, to assert 
the power to change that result so that 
the motion would succeed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1295 
(Purpose: To subpoena certain rel-
evant witnesses and documents.) 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send an amendment to the desk to sub-
poena Mulvaney, Bolton, Duffey, Blair, 
and the White House, OMB, DOD, and 
State Department documents, and I 
ask that it be read. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHUMER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1295. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
the 
amendment be considered as read. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, it is so ordered. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s

The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized.

There is a sufficient second.

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I

the

The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-

The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To subpoena John Robert Bolton) 
At the appropriate place in the matter fol-
lowing the resolving clause, insert the fol-
lowing: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this resolution, pursuant to rules V and VI of 
the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the 
Senate 
When 
Sitting

Impeachment 
Trials, the Chief Justice of the United 
States, through the Secretary of the Senate, 
shall issue a subpoena for the taking of testi-
mony on oral deposition and subsequent tes-
timony before the Senate of John Robert 
Bolton, and the Sergeant at Arms is author-
ized to utilize the services of the Deputy Ser-
geant at Arms or any other employee of the 
Senate in serving the subpoena authorized to 
be issued by this paragraph. 
The deposition authorized by this resolu-
tion shall be taken before, and presided over 
by, the Chief Justice of the United States, 
who shall administer to the witness the oath 
prescribed by rule XXV of the Rules of Pro-
cedure and Practice in the Senate When Sit-
ting on Impeachment Trials. The Chief Jus-
tice shall have authority to rule, as an ini-
tial matter, upon any question arising out of 
the deposition. All objections to a question 
shall be noted by the Chief Justice upon the 
record of the deposition but the examination 
shall proceed, and the witness shall answer 
such question. The witness may refuse to an-
swer a question only when necessary to pre-
serve a legally recognized privilege, or con-
stitutional right, and must identify such 
privilege cited if refusing to answer a ques-
tion. 
Examination of the witness at a deposition 
shall be conducted by the Managers on the 
part of the House of Representatives or their 
counsel, and by counsel for the President. 
The witness shall be examined by not more 
than 2 persons each on behalf of the Man-
agers and counsel for the President. The wit-
ness may be accompanies by counsel. The 
scope of the examination by the Managers 
and counsel for both parties shall be limited 
to subject matters reflected in the Senate 
record. The party taking a deposition shall 
present to the other party, not less than 18 
hours in advance of the deposition, copies of 
all exhibits which the deposing party intends 
to enter into the deposition. No exhibits out-
side of the Senate record shall be employed, 
except for articles and materials in the 
press, including electronic media. Any party 
may interrogate the witness as if the witness 
were declared adverse. 
The deposition shall be videotaped and a 
transcript of the proceeding shall be made. 
The deposition shall be conducted in private. 
No person shall be admitted to the deposi-
tion except for the following: The witness, 
counsel for the witness, the Managers on the 
part of the House of Representatives, counsel 
for the Managers, counsel for the President, 
and the Chief Justice; further, such persons 
whose presence is required to make and pre-
serve 
a

in 
videotaped and transcript forms, and staff 
members to the Chief Justice whose presence 
is required to assist the Chief Justice in pre-
siding over the deposition, or for other pur-
poses, as determined by the Chief Justice. 
All persons present must maintain the con-
fidentiality of the proceeding. 
The Chief Justice at the deposition shall 
file the videotaped and transcribed records of 
the deposition with the Secretary of the Sen-
ate, who shall maintain them as confidential 
proceedings of the Senate. The Sergeant at 
Arms is authorized to make available for re-
view at secure locations, any of the video-
tapes or transcribed deposition records to 
Members of the Senate, one designated staff 
member per Senator, and the Chief Justice. 
The Senate may direct the Secretary of the 
Senate to distribute such materials, and to 
use whichever means of dissemination, in-
cluding printing as Senate documents, print-
ing in the Congressional Record, photo- and 
video- duplication, and electronic dissemina-

complish any distribution of the videotaped

directed to make pursuant to this paragraph.

the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (2 
U.S.C. 288b, 288d, and 288f), sections 6002 and 
6005 of title 18, United States Code, and sec-
tion 1365 of title 28, United States Code. The 
Secretary of the Senate shall arrange for

vided in section 205. Such expenses as may be
