May we have eyes to see and hearts 
to receive them. 
Prepare the way and give us knowl-
edge of the salvation You offer, the for-
giveness of sins, the mercy You bestow 
on us. 
May our ears be open and our souls 
receptive to these incredible gifts. 
Give light to those who sit in dark-
ness and over whom the shadow of 
death looms near. 
May we be the hands in sharing Your 
gracious comfort. 
Open our eyes to the vital work You 
are doing even this day. 
May we have the courage to serve 
You in holding up the lowly and filling 
the hungry with good things. May we 
honor the humble and show Your 
mercy. 
Guide our feet into the way of peace 
in this season and into the future. 
May we be worthy of the grace You 
extend through our generation. 
In Your radical name we pray. 
Amen.

TRIBUTE TO THOMAS O’BRIEN 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 20, 2021 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Thomas O’Brien, an accom-
plished professional staff member of the 
House Appropriations Committee, who is retir-
ing after more than 31 years of service in the 
Federal Government. 
Tom began his career at the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration in 1990. In 2004, during 
his tenure with the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, Tom was detailed to the House 
Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, 
where he assisted with the fiscal year 2005 
and fiscal year 2006 appropriations bills. 
Following his detail, Tom became the Dep-
uty Chief Financial Officer for the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspec-
tion Service and would soon become the Chief 
Financial Officer. In his role, Tom was respon-
sible for managing fiscal policies and practices 
for over 10,000 employees and $1 billion. 
Then, at the start of the 112th Congress, 
Tom rejoined the House Appropriations Sub-
committee on Agriculture as professional staff, 
where he utilized his more than 20 years of 
Executive Branch experience. In 2014, Tom 
became Clerk for the House Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Agriculture. In this role, Tom 
was responsible for a portfolio exceeding $23 
billion. 
Tom was an outstanding member of the Ap-
propriations Committee staff for more than ten 
years, and he served on my staff for three of 
those years. Tom was tasked with working on 
some of the most complex issues in the agri-
culture sphere, and he performed exception-
ally. 
Tom dedicated much of his life to public 
service, and I know he is looking forward to 
spending more time with his wife and three 
daughters. Tom will be dearly missed by his 
colleagues—I wish him the very best in his 
next chapter and thank him for his devoted 
service to the United States. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF MARY RYSKA 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 20, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mary Ryska of River 
Rouge on the occasion of her 100th birthday. 
Her contributions to our community as a Rosie 
the Riveter are worthy of commendation. 
Born on December 23, 1921, Mrs. Ryska 
was born and raised in River Rouge, Michi-
gan, where she remains today. She attended 
school at St. John Cantius until 8th grade, 
when she left to work as a housekeeper in 
Detroit to help support her family. Though she 
had setbacks, she never gave up on obtaining 
her high school diploma. At age 67, she grad-
uated from high school in Southgate, Michigan 
and earned her diploma. 
Employed at the Willow Run Bomber Plant 
in Ypsilanti Township, Mrs. Ryska was a riv-
eter, riveting the camera pulley bracket on the 
B24 aircraft. She remained working at the 
plant until she was pregnant with her second 
child. As a Rosie the Riveter, Mary’s hard 
work, grit, and patriotism not only sustained 
the American war effort, but paved a path for 
the next generation of working women. 
Ever the hard worker, Mrs. Ryska has held 
jobs at various companies around Southeast 
Michigan. She was also the landlady for prop-
erties throughout River Rouge. She is cur-
rently a member of St. Andrew Bessette 
Church and was previously very active as a 
member of Our Lady of Lourdes Church. Her 
lifelong commitment to service reminds us all 
of the impact that the Rosies have had on our 
state and nation. She was married to her lov-
ing husband Stanley for 48 years, and to-
gether they had two daughters and two sons. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Mary Ryska on her 
100th birthday. I join with her family—including 
her five grandchildren and ten great grand-
children—and friends in extending my best 
and warmest wishes to her on this special 
day. I am proud to honor her life, her accom-
plishments, and her invaluable contributions to 
our nation as a Rosie the Riveter.

HONORING EARL E. MCLEOD, JR. 
HON. JOE WILSON

Monday, December 20, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, congratulations to a great South Car-
olinian for his service, Earl E. McLeod, Jr. 
upon his retirement. 
Earl served as the Executive Director for the 
Building Industry Association of Central South 
Carolina from 1983 to 2021. Prior to working 
at the BIA, Earl was the District Administrator 
and campaign manager for Congressman 
John L. Napier of South Carolina, as well as 
a national sales manager for Aluminum Lad-
der Company. In 2001, Earl was inducted into 
the South Carolina Housing Hall of Fame and 
received the Distinguished Alumnus Award for 
Francis Marion University in 1996. He is a 
NAHB Gold Key Member. 
He has been a member of the Greater Lex-
ington Chamber of Commerce Board of Direc-
tors, Vice Chairman of the Lexington County 
Planning Commission, Member of the Home & 
Garden Show Executives International, mem-
ber of the Board of Directors for Community

tial Builders Commission. 
Best wishes to Earl and Judy McLeod beau-
tiful home on Lake Murray.

HONORING 
THE 
60TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
OPERATION 
PEDRO 
PAN 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 20, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the 60th anniversary of Operation 
Pedro Pan. Fidel Castro’s communist regime 
tainted a country beyond repair over six dec-
ades ago. Parents on the island became in-
creasingly concerned with the communist rise 
and indoctrination of their children that was 
taking place in schools. What is today known 
as Operation Pedro Pan was the result of con-
cerned parents making a critical decision 
about how their children would be taught and 
educated and these parents ultimately decid-
ing to send their children to the United States, 
where freedom and liberty are guaranteed in 
our Constitution. 
Operation Pedro Pan took place from De-
cember 1960 to October 1962 and was cre-
ated by the Catholic Welfare Bureau. More 
than a thousand Cuban minors left the island 
and arrived in the United States. Upon arrival, 
many of the minors were reunited with rel-
atives and family friends residing in the United 
States, while others were looked after by the 
Catholic Welfare Bureau. Other children were 
part of the Cuban Refugee Children’s Program 
where they were relocated to various other 
states. 
South Florida became a central hub where 
many minors arrived and settled. Throughout 
the years those who arrived in the United 
States have contributed significantly. Many 
went on to pursue various career fields that in-
clude business, medicine, education, law, and 
public service. Others went on to become 
small business owners and citizens who have 
come to strongly advocate on behalf of the 
courageous freedom fighters in Cuba who 
have endured decades of oppression under 
the communist regime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1386 
December 20, 2021 
Operation Pedro Pan is the largest orga-
nized exodus of unaccompanied minors in the 
Western Hemisphere to this day. On its 60th 
anniversary, I want to highlight the significant 
contributions that many of those who arrived 
because of Operation Pedro Pan have made. 
I know firsthand the American dream many of 
the exiles achieved because I immigrated to 
this country with my family when I was a 
young boy. In just one generation, my family 
went from Cuba to Congress. I believe with all 
my heart and soul that in no other country in 
the world is that achievement possible.

HONORING DOUG AND JOAN 
BRUNELL AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 20, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in honoring Pastor Doug and Joan Brunell, 
owners of Uptown Brick & Bell Cafe´
in 
Creston, Iowa, as our Iowans of the Week. 
Last year, during the height of the COVID– 
19 pandemic, Pastor Doug and his wife, Joan, 
were driving through some Iowa towns and 
couldn’t help but notice the number of boarded 
up churches that they were seeing. They saw 
one in Creston, Iowa, just a few blocks from 
downtown, and Pastor Doug was interested. 
When they were able to get a full tour of the 
property, Pastor Doug was touched. This 
church needed a purpose, and the folks in 
Creston were the perfect fit to fill that purpose. 
On the Fourth of July, 2021, Pastor Doug 
and Joan opened the Uptown Brick & Bell 
Cafe´ in the basement of the old church. They 
started with a coffee and espresso machine, 
while also serving various assortments of ice 
cream. With the cafe´ being in the basement of 
the old church, there is plenty of space for 
customers and community members to meet 
for coffee or ice cream. 
The basement consists of a large main 
room, filled with tables, chairs, and even bean 
bags for customers to enjoy and relax. At the 
front of the room, you’ll see the main counter 
where customers can order their favorite cof-
fee or espresso drinks or try out the different 
flavors and styles of ice cream. The space 
even has an attached kitchen, which has 
come in handy lately as Pastor Doug and 
Joan have been expanding the menu of what 
they are offering their customers. Not only can 
you stop by for a pick-me-up or a sweet treat, 
but folks can also stop by for bagels and 
sandwiches if they are looking for a quick bite. 
The cafe´ also serves the Creston commu-
nity in other ways. The main sanctuary of the 
old church is still as functional and beautiful as 
ever, and it is rented out for services every 
Sunday. Pastor Doug and Joan also plan to 
host other community events and organiza-
tions, such as CAT (Creston Area Theatre), 
Iowa Realty Association meetings, arts and 
craft sessions, and even auctions, among 
other events. 
In a matter of just a few months, Pastor 
Doug and Joan were able to bring the old 
church back to life, cultivating an infectious 
sense of community, togetherness, and sup-
port. It’s folks like Pastor Doug and Joan who 
make communities more connected and make 
towns like Creston a better place to live. 
Madam Speaker, because of Pastor Doug and 
Joan’s dedication to faith, service, and com-
munity, I am so honored to recognize them as 
this week’s Iowans of the Week.

HER SERVICE TO BAKERSFIELD 
COLLEGE AND THE KERN COUN-
TY COMMUNITY 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 20, 2021 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mary Jo Pasek, a talented and 
service-oriented community leader who has 
dedicated herself to improving the work of 
countless students and the Kern County com-
munity throughout her career, on her retire-
ment from Bakersfield College. 
Mary Jo arrived in Bakersfield, California by 
way of Minnesota—following her graduation 
from the College of St. Scholastica—and 
worked in the booming Kern County oil and 
natural gas industry before joining Calcot Lim-
ited, a cotton grower and marketing coopera-
tive, where she would work for over 25 years. 
In a testament to her leadership skills and 
drive, Mary Jo went on to become the Assist-
ant Vice President of Human Resources at 
Calcot. While in this role, Mary Jo oversaw the 
employee benefits program, developed a com-
puter literacy program for the Calcot work-
force, and managed the Calcot-Seitz Founda-
tion Scholarship Program, which awards an-
nual scholarships to promising students pur-
suing careers in agriculture. 
Following her passion for helping students 
succeed, Mary Jo began a new chapter in her 
career in 2007 when she joined Bakersfield 
College—part of the Kern Community College 
District (KCCD)—and its team of devoted edu-
cators, who have committed themselves to ad-
vancing the KCCD’s mission of creating life-
long learners. In her role as the Community 
Relations, Scheduling, and Events Manager at 
Bakersfield College, Mary Jo oversaw a num-
ber of departments, including the Human Re-
sources and Event Management divisions. 
She enhanced personnel training and profes-
sional development programs, developed rela-
tionships between the school and broader 
community, and raised needed funds for the 
Bakersfield College Foundation and Athletic 
Department—positioning Bakersfield College 
to continue to offer quality programming for 
students and faculty for years to come. 
Over the years, I have had the privilege of 
participating in many of the events that Mary 
Jo coordinated at Bakersfield College. From 
hosting my office and the Library of Congress 
on Bakersfield College’s campus to conduct 
Veterans History Project interviews to playing 
an integral role in the highly successful 2014 
Kern Agriculture Summit that I joined to dis-
cuss important issues facing Central Valley 
farmers, Mary Jo has always been uniquely 
capable of bringing together diverse stake-
holders with the shared goal of bettering and 
giving back to the Kern County community. 
In addition to serving others through her 
work at Bakersfield College, Mary Jo has ex-
tensive volunteer experience, having worked 
on behalf of Kern County veterans and several 
community groups, including the Bakersfield 
Breakfast Rotary, United Way of Kern County, 
and the American Cancer Society. She has re-
ceived well-earned recognition for her accom-
plishments over the years, including the Dis-
trict Rotary Rotarian of the Year, Bakersfield 
Breakfast Rotary Volunteer of the Year, and 
Bernice Harrel Chipman Bakersfield Woman of 
the Year awards for her tireless work. 
While Mary Jo will no longer be with Ba-
kersfield College, I am confident she will con-
tinue to be a strong role model for others and 
an enthusiastic leader in the community. On 
behalf of the 23rd Congressional District of 
California, I wish Mary Jo and her husband, 
Tom, all the best as they enter this new chap-
ter in their lives.

HONORING NOELLE RHODES SCOTT 
FOR 21 YEARS OF SERVICE WITH 
THE CABARRUS ARTS COUNCIL 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 20, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Noelle Rhodes Scott for over 21 
years of exemplary service with the Cabarrus 
Arts Council. I have seen Mrs. Rhodes Scott’s 
leadership firsthand and know how much she 
means to our community. 
Mrs. Rhodes Scott began her esteemed ca-
reer after graduating magna cum laude from 
Wake Forest University. Following internships 
with the Arts and Science Council in Charlotte 
and the North Carolina Arts Council, she was 
selected at the Associate Director, and later 
Interim Director, of the High Point Arts Coun-
cil. She went on to become a National Endow-
ment for the Arts Fellow and then joined the 
Arts Council of Fairfax County after her re-
search was complete. 
A giant among her peers in the art commu-
nity, Mrs. Rhodes Scott has long been a fierce 
advocate for the arts and education. Since be-
coming President and CEO of the Cabarrus 
Arts Council in 2000, she has transformed the 
formerly volunteer organization into the pre-
eminent arts council in North Carolina. 
During her tenure with the Cabarrus Arts 
Council, Mrs. Rhodes Scott oversaw the de-
velopment of the Davis Theatre and Galleries 
and launched Students Take Part In The Arts, 
one of North Carolina’s largest art-in-education 
programs. Each year, the Davis Theatre draws 
over 16,000 visitors to our community and the 
education program presents performances to 
over 39,000 children in Cabarrus County 
Schools and Kannapolis City Schools. The 
Cabarrus Arts Council also distributes annual 
grants of over $50,000 to support creative 
projects and artists. 
Mrs. Rhodes Scott has led by example over 
the years and has made immeasurable con-
tributions to our community. Cabarrus County

HONORING 
KIRKLIN 
‘‘KIRK’’ 
WOODCOCK, THE WILTON HIGH-
WAY SUPERINTENDENT, FOR HIS 
ENDURING 
DEDICATION 
TO 
SERVING HIS COMMUNITY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 20, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Kirklin ‘‘Kirk’’ Woodcock for 
over 40 years of unwavering public service 
and congratulate him on his retirement. After 
serving as a Wilton Town Council Member, 
Mr. Woodcock devoted 34 additional years to 
the town as the Highway Superintendent. 
Mr. Kirk Woodcock is a native to the town 
of Wilton and was first elected to office in 
1979 as a town council member. Eight years 
later, he ran for Highway Superintendent and 
has been reelected 16 times, a testament to 
his outstanding work for the community and 
the immense trust and respect the people of 
Wilton have for him. 
Throughout his 34 years serving as the 
Highway 
Superintendent, 
Mr. 
Woodcock 
oversaw transformative projects that facilitated 
Wilton’s immense growth. Mr. Woodcock and 
his team successfully maintained, built, con-
structed, and plowed Wilton’s 220 lane miles 
of road. Additionally, he has assisted many 
other departments in Wilton and has played a 
pivotal role in helping with the maintenance 
and construction of Gavin Park, Camp Sara-
toga, Grant Cottage, and the new Maple Ave-
nue Firehouse building. Throughout his time 
as Highway Superintendent, Mr. Woodcock al-
ways prioritized the satisfaction of Wilton resi-
dents. 
In addition to going above and beyond as 
Highway Superintendent, Kirk has volunteered 
and organized fundraisers for Double H 
Ranch, which gives children facing life-threat-
ening illnesses the ability to enjoy various out-
door activities in the Adirondacks, including 
the ski slopes that Kirk helped build. 
We are very grateful to Mr. Woodcock for 
loyally serving Wilton and its residents for the 
past 40 years. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
district, I would like to thank Kirk for his con-
tributions to the town of Wilton and congratu-
late him on reaching this important milestone. 
I wish him all the best in this next chapter of 
his life. 
IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT 
OF REV. DR. JOE NATHANIEL 
CROUT AFTER OVER 44 YEARS 
OF MINISTRY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 20, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Rev. Dr. Joe Nathaniel 
Crout on the occasion of his retirement after 
over 44 years of ministry at New Covenant 
Missionary Baptist Church in Ypsilanti, Michi-
gan. His lifetime of service and dedication to 
our community is worthy of commendation. 
Pastor Crout preached his first sermon on 
May 5, 1963 after hearing the call to ministry. 
In 1977 he graduated from Detroit Bible Col-
lege, where he studied Theology and Psy-
chology. That same year he founded New 
Covenant Missionary Baptist Church which 
found it’s home in Ypsilanti, Michigan. In 2001, 
he was conferred an honorary doctorate de-
gree from the Tennessee School of Religion in 
Memphis, Tennessee. Since its founding, Pas-
tor Crout has served as Senior Pastor for New 
Covenant Missionary Baptist Church. He has 
dedicated his life to Jesus Christ and has fo-
cused on serving the needs of those families 
and individuals in our community. 
An Ypsilanti resident for over 60 years, Pas-
tor Crout has been greatly involved in our 
community. He is a founding member of the 
Minister’s Alliance of Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor, and 
Vicinity and has been active in organizations 
that serve our neighbors such as Helping 
Hands Charity, Inc and the Partnership in Eco-
nomic Alliance for Community Empowerment. 
He 
has 
served 
on 
the 
board 
of 
the 
Washtenaw Housing Commission and is a fre-
quent volunteer for Habitat for Humanity and 
the Parkridge Community Center of Ypsilanti. 
A trusted friend and confidant for many in 
leaders and individuals alike in our area, Pas-
tor Crout’s passion for humanity and commu-
nity is felt by all who have met him. His char-
acter, compassion, and dedication to service 
has touched countless lives. Pastor Crout re-
sides in Ypsilanti with his loving wife and min-
istry partner Audrey, they have been married 
for 44 years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Rev. Dr. Joe Nathaniel 
Crout on his retirement from New Covenant 
Missionary Baptist Church. As a pillar of our 
community, a leader, and a man of true faith, 
Pastor Crout’s powerful sermons will be 
missed. We join with his congregation, friends, 
and family in wishing Pastor Crout the very 
best in retirement and thank him for his years 
of service.

HONORING TIM KRUEGER AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 20, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Tim Krueger as Iowan of the 
Week. Tim leads Harvest Academy, a 24- 
month life skills academy for those with crimi-
nal backgrounds, substance abuse challenges, 
or who have experienced homelessness. 
Tim’s passion is changing the lives of 
Iowans by focusing on behaviors that cause 
individuals to hit rock bottom. After teaching 
weekly classes for at-risk teens in Peoria, Illi-
nois, Tim discovered his true calling was help-
ing individuals who wanted to better their lives 
and didn’t know where to turn. He recognized 
his once-a-week classes were not enough to 
help make real change for at-risk individuals. 
After a conversation with his family, Jim de-
cided to leave his role in the private sector 
and find a way to make change in his commu-
nity. 
Tim visited several therapeutic model com-
munities across the country to learn more 
about the structure of the programs. He be-
came a program observer for The Other Side 
Academy in Salt Lake City before taking what 
he learned and bringing it to central Iowa. Tim 
established Harvest Academy in Indianola in 
2019. 
Harvest Academy follows a participative, 
group-based approach to anti-social behavior, 
criminal activity, and drug addiction through a 
two-year therapeutic program. Students apply 
voluntarily and must be accepted into the pro-
gram. The program is completely free for stu-
dents. 
The community therapeutic model allows 
students to enhance their skills, solve prob-
lems together, and hold one another account-
able. Students have the opportunity to earn 
leadership positions and take on new duties to 
serve as role models for newer students in the 
community. Students also participate in skills- 
based training to help them enter the work-
force. Harvest Academy assists students with 
aspects of the job search and provides train-
ing in corporate development, culinary arts, 
landscaping, and facility management. Harvest 
Academy operates a local moving company 
that helps the program remain self-sustain-
able. 
Tim is a fantastic role model and leader at 
Harvest Academy. He advocates for those 
who want to change their lives and provides a 
safe living space for individuals to change 
their lives. I am proud to honor Tim Krueger 
as Iowan of the Week.

Then, in 2006, Commander Koziatek en-
rolled in the U.S. Naval Joint Flight Training 
program. Following completion of this pro-
gram, Commander Koziatek utilized his train-
ing to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil 
spill and the humanitarian relief efforts fol-
lowing the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, he would 
later execute missions spanning the Coast 
Guard’s largest area of operation. 
In 2018, Commander Koziatek was as-
signed to the U.S. Coast Guard’s Financial 
Analysis & Budget Execution Division, where 
he was responsible for a portfolio exceeding 
$6 billion. Then, in 2020 Commander Koziatek 
began as a fellow to the House Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Homeland Security. He 
brought nearly 20 years of experience with the 
U.S. Coast Guard and became a trusted and 
valuable member of my staff. 
I offer my deepest appreciation to Com-
mander Koziatek, and I wish him the very 
best.
