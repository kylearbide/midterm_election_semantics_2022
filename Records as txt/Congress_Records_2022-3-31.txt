REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN 
DON YOUNG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize one of my 
political mentors, the dean of the 
House, Representative Don Young. 
I met Don on one of my first days as 
a Member of the House of Representa-
tives. I walked into this Chamber and 
took a seat. Minutes later, some old 
guy starts digging his knuckles into 
my back. I couldn’t believe that was 
happening. I had no idea what this guy 
was doing. 
You can imagine my confusion as I 
frustratingly 
found 
myself 
another 
chair, but you can also be assured that 
I never sat in that seat again. It wasn’t 
until afterward that I learned that I 
had sat in his seat. I never made that 
mistake again. 
Knowing him, he has probably al-
ready picked out a seat in Heaven, and 
I pity the fool who tries to sit there. 
Don Young is and was a dear friend. 
At work, he was my mentor, someone 
whose stalwart belief system and pas-
sion for public service inspired me 
every single day. 
Don truly loved the great men and 
women of Alaska. That was obvious 
from his fearless advocacy for the Last 
Frontier up here in Washington and 
even more obvious on our annual fish-
ing trip, where I got to see firsthand 
the State he loved so dearly. 
I was able to go with him on three 
separate occasions on that trip. Every 
one was a great experience. I will miss 
those annual fishing trips, not just for 
the sport of it, but for the comradery I 
felt with the amazing public servants 
who joined together to learn from one 
another. 
Luckily for Alaska residents and the 
Young family, Don was a better man 
and legislator than he was a fisherman. 
My prayers and support go out to his 
wife, Anne, his children, and everyone 
who was privileged to know this great 
friend, father, and public servant. 
It was an honor to gather and pay 
tribute to him yesterday. He made 
every second count and worked hard to 
leave this country better than he found 
it. He was the oldest Member of Con-
gress, and I never let him forget that. 
I still feel like his time on Earth here 
was cut short. 
Don, your presence, your knowledge, 
and your leadership will be sorely 
missed, but they will never be forgot-
ten. 
REMEMBERING MABEL JOSEPHINE ‘‘JO’’ MASON 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
a woman dedicated to the service of her 
community, Jo Mason. Throughout her 
years, Jo remained involved in her 
community in as many aspects as she 
could. 
After graduating from Glynn Acad-
emy, Jo was active in The American 
Legion Auxiliary for 78 years, where 
she held several positions in the local, 
district, and State levels. 
The Saint Simons native enjoyed 
making the lap throws that The Amer-
ican Legion Auxiliary gave out to vet-
erans and their spouses in the local 
nursing homes in Brunswick. Jo also 
volunteered at the fire department, 
helping to man radio station 2 and 
serving as treasurer for many years. 
She was involved with the Golden 
Isles Emerald Society, Elks Lodge, 
Golden Isles Retired Firefighters Asso-
ciation, Veterans Council of Golden 
Isles, and the Coastal Republican Wom-
en’s Club. She set an example for all of 
us to follow. 
Her memory will be cherished by the 
many lives that she impacted, includ-
ing her husband, Bill, who she met on 
a blind date in December 1965 while he 
was serving in the Marine Corps. 
I am praying for her friends, her fam-
ily, and her community during this 
very sad time. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DR. GROVER BELL 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the life of 
a man dedicated to his community and 
to the people he served, Dr. Grover Bell 
of Savannah, Georgia. 
Dr. Bell was born in Sardis, Georgia, 
in 1928 and went to Georgia Teachers 
College, where he met his beloved wife, 
Lourdine. 
After determining that his calling 
was to join the ministry, Dr. Bell at-
tended Emory School of Divinity, 
where he learned to be a shepherd of 
men. 
Throughout his career, he served al-
most 30 churches of the South Georgia 
United Methodist Conference, includ-
ing my home church of Wesley Monu-
mental. 
He was loved as a minister by those 
he served and truly embodied what it 
means to put others before oneself. 
Dr. Bell was also known for his gar-
dening and for his southern, homestyle 
cooking, two of his passions. His love 
for daylilies and fried chicken were ri-
valed only by his love for God and his 
family. 
Leaving behind his wife, four chil-
dren, eight grandchildren, six great- 
grandchildren, and countless others to 
whom he ministered, Dr. Bell has left a 
lasting impact on the community that 
he loved so dearly. 
His family and friends remain in my 
thoughts and prayers after this tre-
mendous loss. 
f 
REPEAL THE PINK TAX 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. SPEIER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, on the 
very last day of Women’s History 
Month, I want to draw attention to the 
fact that there is an insidious form of 
gender discrimination that goes on in 
this country from cradle to grave. It is 
called the pink tax. 
It costs more to be a woman. We have 
seen it happen over and over again, 
where retailers find it okay to jack up 
the prices for the same products just 
because they are being marketed to 
women. 
A New York City Consumer Affairs 
study compared 800 products and found 
that they were 13 percent more for 
those that were virtually identical but 
provided for women. As I am going to 
show you today, we see the cost as 
much as 60 percent more for the same 
products being focused on women, but 
basically the same products. 
We need to think no further than 
looking at haircuts, where a woman 
can’t get a haircut for $26 like former 
Governor Scott Walker, who mocked 
one of our colleagues about the cost of 
her particular haircut. 
Let’s talk about retail sales. I had 
my office go online and do some online 
shopping. On Amazon, you can get this 
four-pack of Dove deodorant for women 
for $19.39, but the male version of this 
particular product is only $13.58 for a 
four-pack. That is a 60 percent cost dif-
ferential, a 60 percent tax on women. 
Here is a pack of probiotics from CVS 
for a woman. It costs $32.79. For a man, 
it costs $22.79. That is a 68 percent in-
crease and a tax on women for the 
same product. 
Then, we can move on to diapers. Be-
lieve it or not, diapers for girls cost 
more than diapers for boys. In fact, 
$37.79 for boys and $33.99 for girls. 
Finally, my favorite is the teddy 
bears. If you go online and buy a pink 
teddy bear, you are going to pay a tax. 
It is $14.99. A blue teddy bear is only 
$12.30. 
This is stupid. This is crazy. This is 
discrimination. It is time for us to deal 
with it, and there is a way to deal with 
it. 
I have introduced the Pink Tax Re-
peal Act, which I am hopeful will be 
heard in the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. I am hopeful that, once 
and for all, we can do something about 
the fact that women pay more for the 
same goods and the same services. 
In California, we have a law that I 
had passed many years ago that fo-
cused on services. The Assembly Office 
of Research found that women pay 
$1,300 more per year for services. It 
shouldn’t be based on gender; it should

be based on the amount of time it 
takes, whether it is a haircut or dry 
cleaning a shirt. We have seen over and 
over again that we pay more for the 
same service as well. 
Colleagues, I hope that on this very 
last day of Women’s History Month, we 
remember this for the rest of the year, 
that women pay more for the same 
goods and services, and that should be 
against the law. 
f 
PROTECT WOMEN’S SPORTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the strides 
women have made across all corners of 
the sports world deserve to be cele-
brated, not torn to pieces by the far 
left’s radical ideological agenda. 
This year officially marks the 50th 
anniversary of title IX, a law from 1972 
that mandates equal opportunities for 
women in education. 
While this anniversary deserves to be 
recognized, the threat of President 
Biden’s flawed interpretation of this 
legislation looms larger than ever be-
fore. This administration’s radical re-
interpretation of title IX to include 
sexual orientation and gender identity 
has pushed women to the sidelines. 
President Biden’s decision to allow 
biological male athletes who identify 
as transgender to compete in women’s 
sports is an affront to the progress that 
women have made since 1972. 
Title IX was a revolution for wom-
en’s sports. Since its passage, title IX 
has spurred women’s participation in 
sports by a considerable margin. In-
stead of rightfully celebrating these 
achievements, the left is willing to sac-
rifice them for the sake of its radical 
political agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, we should not be toler-
ating the left’s assault on women. We 
must ensure that the safety and needs 
of young girls and women are made a 
top priority. Erasing sex and gender 
means, ultimately, erasing women, es-
pecially when it comes to sports. 
Girls and women at the top of their 
sport lose a fair chance to compete 
when a biological male enters the field. 
How is this any different than keeping 
women off the field altogether? 
We can’t let women’s sports become 
collateral damage to the far left’s cam-
paign against the traditional, science- 
based understanding of sex and gender. 
Allowing women and girls to suffer for 
the sake of being politically correct is 
the textbook definition of cowardice. 
I am proud of the progress our Nation 
has made in the past 50 years to uplift 
and affirm the rights of women. The 
prospect of those advances being lost 
today is gut-wrenching. If we allow 
these fantasies of the radical left to be-
come mainstream, 50 years of progress 
will be buried completely. 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN 
UKRAINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak from both the heart 
and the Constitution. 
The privilege of citizenship in the 
United States gives Americans the 
freedom to exert and to speak about 
what is in the depths of their heart 
while holding the Constitution that in-
dicates: ‘‘We the people of the United 
States, in order to form a more perfect 
Union, establish justice’’—the Con-
stitution goes on to describe a myriad 
of justice issues in the Bill of Rights. 
In addition to that, we have exhibits, 
symbols of freedom. I begin first with 
the Statue of Liberty standing tall in 
the New York Harbor. What you can 
see is the throng of humanity, fleeing 
Ukrainians, who now will probably 
amount to 6 million internally dis-
placed persons and refugees in totality. 
b 1015 
Amongst these individuals are sepa-
rated families from their husbands, 
brothers, and cousins and others who 
are on the fight. 
But it is important to describe why 
we are here: one man, Putin. One man. 
One man has established this level of 
intense brutality and violence, insen-
sitivity, rage, and attack. 
Mr. Putin’s attack is on the babies of 
Ukraine. I will not give him any cre-
dence or respect that he is at war. He 
is in the midst of destruction and vile 
actions and attacked a hospital with 
pregnant women. He separated preg-
nant women from their babies who 
were born dead or mothers who gave 
birth and died and the baby died short-
ly thereafter. 
The new revelation is that babies and 
women and children have been stolen 
by Russian soldiers and carted off to 
Russian territory. That is the vileness 
of this ludicrous Putin war. 
Then we come to find out—which is 
in the public domain—that he may not 
be getting the right information, but 
let us not use that as an excuse. 
It didn’t matter what revelations he 
would get. He is a violent actor living 
in a dream world of reimagining the 
Soviet Union. 
And so it is crucial for those of us 
who believe in peace that our adminis-
tration determines the validity of any 
peace discussions because we would 
want to be part of ensuring that they 
are viable. 
But, at the same time, to the dismay 
of many of us, the weapons should be 
given, the drones should be given, the 
war has to stop, and there is no end in 
sight. 
And so the murderous attack, the de-
struction of cities, such as the ocean- 
based city, that have been destroyed, 
brought to their knees, individuals lost 
lives under the pile of rubbage, and 
particularly, the theater where 300 died 
where children were written on the 
outside. 
Mr. Speaker, we must prepare now 
for refugees. And may I suggest that 
we must prepare for refugees coming 
from South and Central America that 
will include Haitians and Africans. 
We are prepared to take in 125,000. 
Only 7,000 have been utilized. As some 
would say, including my late friend and 
colleague, Elijah Cummings, America 
is better than this. We know how to do 
this, and we must find the way to do it. 
Standing at podiums and banging on 
the desk about we don’t want these 
people, then you must not want those 
who are fleeing the bloody, violent ac-
tions of this horrific person. 
I believe we should stand united as 
Americans, to capture the words: ‘‘We 
the people of the United States, in 
order to form a more perfect Union, es-
tablish justice’’. . . . I want us to stand 
with the Ukrainian people, that nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank MARCY KAPTUR 
for leading the Ukrainian Caucus and 
all of the Members, Republicans and 
Democrats. 
But as I conclude, let me quickly say 
in 1 minute one issue that we should 
not forget in establishing justice: We 
must have oversight over the United 
States Supreme Court, and the texts of 
a spouse, as well, must be addressed, 
and we will address it. 
f 
COVENANT 
SCHOOL 
BOYS 
AND 
GIRLS CHAMPIONSHIP BASKET-
BALL TEAMS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
West Virginia (Mrs. MILLER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
both the boys and girls high school bas-
ketball 
teams 
from 
the 
Covenant 
School in Huntington, West Virginia. 
The boys high school basketball team 
took home the national championship 
in their division and finished their sea-
son with an 11-game winning streak. 
The girls high school basketball team 
came in second place in their division 
nationally. 
Athletics play a huge role in ensur-
ing that our next generation is well- 
rounded, able to work as a team, and 
are 
equipped 
to 
tackle 
challenges 
ahead. 
I applaud the Covenant School for in-
stilling these very important values in 
our student athletes. 
West Virginia is so proud of the Cov-
enant School’s basketball teams. 
f 
GREAT LAKES AUTHORITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with considerable anticipation as 
Great Lakes Members introduce legis-
lation to create the Great Lakes Au-
thority. 
The Great Lakes Authority is an in-
strumentality that will unlock our 
freshwater, industrial heartland’s full 
potential for the century ahead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4012 
March 31, 2022 
The Midwest communities our Mem-
bers represent are home to people who 
make, build, and grow that which 
makes, builds, and grows America. 
For decades, however, our region has 
borne the brunt of job losses associated 
with disastrous trade policies, under-
investment, and deindustrialization. 
Since the passage of NAFTA in 1993, 
China’s entrance into the World Trade 
Organization in 2001, and CAFTA’s pas-
sage in 2005, over 91,000 factories have 
closed across our country. 
Nearly 5 million good-paying jobs 
have been lost, and our region has been 
very hard hit and is clawing its way 
back. 
But our workers and their families in 
Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and 
New York, in the Great Lakes water-
shed have suffered enormously as mid-
dle class jobs evaporated. 
The tragedy does not end there. 
Local governments have been left to 
scramble as declining revenues led to 
the collapse of their budgets and the 
accrual of crushing bonded indebted-
ness. 
The size and scope of these accumu-
lated economic challenges are too 
much for any one city or county or, in-
deed, State to overcome alone. Places 
like Toledo, Ohio, Lorain, Detroit, Buf-
falo, Flint, Rochester, all the towns 
along the old Erie Canal struggle to re-
cover from the outsourcing of manufac-
turing jobs to penny-wage countries. 
Chicago, Cleveland, and Erie, Penn-
sylvania, alone are limited in their 
ability to halt climate change and re-
verse its increasing effects on their 
shorelines and neighborhoods. 
The Great Lakes region needs a boost 
through accelerated investments and 
strategic and coordinated support to 
get back on track. 
Last year, President Biden and con-
gressional 
Democrats 
accomplished 
what many had tried but failed to do, 
and that is pass an historic investment 
in jobs and infrastructure. That is step 
one. 
This support will help empower our 
communities to begin planning the 
necessary steps to rebuilding roads and 
bridges, improve ports, rail lines and 
airports, modernize energy and water 
infrastructure, and protect all of our 
lakes, the freshwater kingdom on this 
continent. 
But to maximize the impact and 
turbocharge revitalization, our region 
really needs a strategic plan to coordi-
nate these resources along, impor-
tantly, with private investment to 
reboot our future. 
The Great Lakes region is the only 
major economic region in our country 
that lacks a Federal entity dedicated 
to supporting its long-term coordi-
nated economic development and con-
serving its natural environment. 
The West’s water is served by the Bu-
reau of Reclamation, or if you look at 
the Delta Regional Authority, it helps 
10 million people in the Delta Region. 
And more than 400 counties from Mis-
sissippi to West Virginia are served by 
the Appalachian Regional Commission. 
The Great Lakes deserves no less. 
The Great Lakes Authority Act is long 
overdue and will create an instrumen-
tality to serve the Great Lakes fresh 
watershed which will become even 
more important in the decades to come 
with each passing day. 
The Great Lakes Authority will be a 
Federal/State instrumentality like the 
others to spur job creation and world- 
class worker education, training, and 
adjustment in communities left be-
hind. 
It will foster innovation to build for-
ward the struggling core U.S. manufac-
turing and industrial base. And it will 
promote new advances in renewable en-
ergy technologies like solar, wind and 
hydrogen 
while 
conserving 
and 
stewarding our precious environmental 
assets. 
It will allow us an efficient multi- 
modal transportation shared network 
with our closest neighbor, Canada, that 
connects people and goods with where 
they need to go. Indeed, Canada is our 
largest trading partner. 
For America to compete in this cen-
tury, we simply need a Great Lakes 
Authority, and I urge my colleagues to 
join us in this important effort. Please 
help us help the Great Lakes region.

AMERICAN BUDGET CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address a crisis eroding the 
budgets of hard-working Americans. 
Earlier this month, the price of un-
leaded gasoline rose to the highest 
level on record, and President Biden’s 
anti-energy policies are directly re-
sponsible. 
On the campaign trail, Joe Biden 
promised to end fossil fuels. Since as-
suming office, President Biden has 
worked to make good on that promise, 
imposing 
81 
individual 
anti-energy 
policies. 
Coincidentally, the price of gasoline 
has risen 81 percent since the beginning 
of his presidency. 
Analysts estimate that President 
Biden’s anti-energy agenda will cost 
American families an additional $2,000 
per year in gasoline costs alone. This is 
staggering for the 64 percent of Ameri-
cans who live paycheck to paycheck, 
thanks to rising costs. 
President Biden claims he can’t do 
much right now to reduce gas prices. 
This simply is not true. President 
Biden can end the Federal freeze on 
new oil and gas projects, fast track 
LNG export permits, expedite approval 
of all pipeline and energy development, 
and stop the regulatory barrage on 
U.S. energy development. 
There is so much that can and should 
be done right now, and this crusade 
against American energy dominance 
must end. 
RECOGNIZING THE SHERBURNE COUNTY 
SHERIFF’S OFFICE 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the extraordinary 
achievement of the Sherburne County 
Sheriff’s Office. 
Sheriff Joel Brott, his deputies, and 
the Sherburne County Jail and clinic 
staff have earned the prestigious Triple 
Crown accreditation from the National 
Sheriffs’ Association. 
As one of only 50 sheriffs’ offices in 
the country to earn the Triple Crown 
accreditation, this is a major achieve-
ment. 
In fact, this accreditation is so rare 
that, according to the National Sher-
iffs’ Association, fewer than 100 sher-
iffs’ offices have qualified since its es-
tablishment in 1993. 
The Triple Crown requires simulta-
neous accreditation by four law en-
forcement 
organizations. 
Achieving 
one of them is a feat, but gaining all 
four at once is truly remarkable. 
Congratulations, Sheriff Brott. We 
applaud you and your entire staff for 
your exceptional work and commit-
ment to excellence in law enforcement. 
OWEN LIPINSKI HOCKEY TOURNAMENT 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a young hockey 
player in my district who embodies the 
spirit of our great sport. 
For Minnesotans, hockey is a way of 
life. Like many young people in our 
State, Owen Lipinski grew up with a 
love for the game. 
Sadly, when Owen was just 2 years 
old, he was diagnosed with Marfan syn-
drome, a connective tissue disorder 
that makes it difficult for him to play. 
One rough hit could cause Owen to 
lose his eyesight or possibly even 
threaten his life. 
However, this didn’t stop him from 
playing. Owen participated in Min-
nesota Special Hockey and enjoyed it, 
but he still wanted more. 
Recently, Owen organized a tour-
nament with six teams composed of 
friends from his neighborhood. He orga-
nized the entire event on a pond in his 
back yard, complete with a public ad-
dress system and a small concession 
stand. 
As a fellow Minnesotan who loves the 
game, Owen is an inspiration. I am in-
spired by Owen and his great work. 
Congratulations on the tournament, 
Owen, and I hope you continue to in-
spire us for years to come.

HONORING REBECCA BOOKER 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding ac-
complishments of one of my constitu-
ents, Ms. Rebecca Booker. 
Rebecca has served the Blaine com-
munity as a certified fire and life safe-
ty educator for the last 20 years. Re-
cently, Rebecca was honored with the 
2022 Dr. Anne W. Phillips Award for 
Leadership in Fire Safety Education by 
the Congressional Fire Services Insti-
tute and the International Fire Service 
Training Association.

Among her many contributions to 
fire safety education, Rebecca helped 
develop 
the 
nationally 
recognized 
Home Safety Survey, a voluntary home 
inspection program that looks for po-
tential fire, injury, and crime hazards 
while offering solutions. Rebecca has 
completed nearly 4,000 of these surveys 
herself and trained many colleagues 
across the country to perform these 
surveys in their communities. 
Ms. Booker also helped establish New 
America Academy in Minnesota, an or-
ganization that provides fire safety 
education for culturally diverse and 
immigrant communities. 
Rebecca, congratulations on earning 
this prestigious award and thank you 
for all you do to increase fire safety 
education in Minnesota’s Sixth Con-
gressional District. 
RECOGNIZING ABBY HONOLD 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Abby Honold, one of 
the strongest Minnesotans I have ever 
met and a leader in the fight against 
sexual assault. 
Sexual assault is a life-shattering 
event, the trauma of which lasts a life-
time but can be compounded in the im-
mediate aftermath by improper care. 
When Abby, then a student at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, reported her as-
sault to police in 2014, she worked with 
a healthcare professional proficient in 
trauma-informed care to recall impor-
tant details about her assault to law 
enforcement and bring the perpetrator 
to justice. 
Survivors like Abby deserve justice, 
and I was pleased to see that the Abby 
Honold Act got signed into law earlier 
this month.

CELEBRATING THE HISTORIC NOM-
INATION 
OF 
KETANJI 
BROWN 
JACKSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ROSS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
with great admiration for the strength 
and grace that Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson has demonstrated throughout 
her nomination process for the United 
States Supreme Court. 
Last week, people from all over the 
world watched as she embarked on a 
journey that only five other women in 
history have taken. For too long, our 
judicial system and our government 
have not reflected the great talent and 
diversity of our Nation. 
Like so many young women, espe-
cially our mothers and grandmothers, I 
had very few female examples to emu-
late at the beginning of my legal ca-
reer. When I was at a pivotal age in 
high school, trying to decide exactly 
what path to take and what was even 
possible to achieve, I got to watch the 
nomination process for Justice Sandra 
Day O’Connor. 
She was the first woman ever nomi-
nated to our Nation’s highest Court, 
and I was deeply moved by her poise 
and 
intelligence 
under 
questioning 
from the much older male Senators. 
Her confirmation solidified in me a 
passion for the law and a belief that I 
could accomplish anything I set my 
mind to. 
I then went on to become a student 
of the Constitution myself, attending 
law school, practicing constitutional 
law, arguing in court, and fighting for 
justice as an attorney, a State legis-
lator, and now as a proud member of 
the Judiciary Committee in the United 
States House of Representatives. 
The world has completely trans-
formed since I watched that confirma-
tion hearing in 1981, yet, since that 
time, only four other women have 
joined our Nation’s highest Court. 
Each of these Justices brought a 
unique perspective and inspired young 
women across the country. 
Because of the small number of 
women who have been appointed, every 
time a woman is up for the bench, it is 
necessarily historic. I am ready for it 
to be less historic. 
Although 51 percent of our popu-
lation is female, of the 115 Justices in 
American history, 110 of them have 
been men. And none of them, not one, 
has been an African-American woman. 
Mr. Speaker, that needs to change at a 
faster rate. 
Justice Ginsburg was once asked 
when there will be enough women on 
the Court. She responded, ‘‘When there 
are nine.’’ 
If confirmed, Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson will be the next, and the first 
African-American woman. I would like 
to say ‘‘when confirmed.’’ Her nomina-
tion marks a momentous step forward 
in the long struggle for a judicial sys-
tem that truly represents every Amer-
ican and delivers justice, fairness, and 
equality for all. 
I can relate to all the young women 
out there watching this nomination 
process, feeling inspired to follow in 
her footsteps. Don’t be deterred or dis-
mayed by the disrespect that she was 
shown by a handful of Senators. My 
message to the young women is: You 
can do this. No matter the challenges 
or the obstacles, you can achieve your 
dreams. 
Judge Brown Jackson said last week 
that her nomination is truly a testa-
ment to the hope and the promise of 
this country. She continues to give us 
new hope, especially to young women 
lawyers, and her rise to the highest 
Court of the land holds out the promise 
of a brighter future for our country. 
Mr. Speaker, Judge Brown Jackson is 
an exceptional, extremely qualified 
nominee, and I look forward to calling 
her Justice Brown Jackson. 
f 
TROUBLING RECORD OF KETANJI 
BROWN JACKSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the troubling record 
of President Biden’s U.S. Supreme 
Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jack-
son, commonly known as KBJ. 
Throughout her legal career, Ketanji 
Brown Jackson has earned a disturbing 
record on crime. In advocating for and 
administering lighter sentences for sex 
offenders, particularly those preying 
on and sexually abusing innocent chil-
dren, KBJ has set an unforgivable pat-
tern that disqualifies her from our 
country’s highest Court. 
A prime example of this pattern can 
be found in the case of U.S. v. Hawkins, 
where the sentencing guidelines called 
for up to 10 years in prison for a man, 
an adult convicted of possessing mul-
tiple images of child sex torture. 
Ketanji Brown Jackson sentenced this 
predator to just 3 months in jail. Un-
conscionable. 
Mr. Hawkins recently told The Wash-
ington Post, ‘‘I wasn’t very happy that 
she gave me 3 months, although after 
reflection when I was in jail, I was 
hearing from other people who said it 
was their first time arrested and they 
got 5 years, 6 years.’’ And he got 3 
months. 
As crime rates soar in our cities 
across the country, adding soft-on- 
crime Justices, especially a Justice 
who basically ignores the crime of pos-
sessing and promoting images of severe 
child sexual assault, adding a Justice 
like that to the bench sends an alarm-
ing message to communities fearing for 
their safety. 
Additionally, during her confirma-
tion hearing last week, KBJ refused to 
define what a woman is, excusing her 
absurdity by claiming she isn’t a biolo-
gist. 
From women’s sports to woke cor-
porations like Disney, liberals are 
pushing an evil agenda that is erasing 
women and undermining women’s ac-
complishments. As conservatives like 
myself fight this woke extremism, 
there will surely be cases considered in 
the future at the Supreme Court that 
require Justices to understand and ac-
cept the differences between men and 
women. 
If KBJ can’t define a woman, how is 
she to adjudicate Title IX cases? This 
is a legitimate question that no Demo-
crat wants to answer. This, too, is dis-
qualifying. 
While I do not serve in the body that 
decides this monumental confirmation, 
I do have a responsibility to tell the 
American people the truth. And the 
truth is, a vote to confirm Ketanji 
Brown Jackson is a vote for lenient 
sentences for child sexual torture, a 
vote for the left’s woke war on can-
celing the achievements of real women, 
and a vote for the liberals’ dangerous 
agenda. 
Americans, 
including 
Georgians, 
don’t want a Justice on the bench who 
supports any of this radical garbage. 
Georgians 
are 
watching 
Senators 
WARNOCK and OSSOFF. Will they vote 
for a Supreme Court nominee that is 
soft on crime, on one of the most hei-
nous crimes of all, child sex torture, or

will they stand up for all of Georgia’s 
family values, protect our children, 
and be tough on crime by voting ‘‘no’’ 
on this Supreme Court nominee? 
For the sake of our great Nation, the 
Senate must save the Supreme Court 
from a lifetime of votes siding with de-
mented pedophiles by voting ‘‘no’’ on 
Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation. 
NO VACCINE MANDATES 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to join me 
in ensuring the Federal Government 
never again abuses its power by order-
ing employees to receive a vaccine or 
lose their job. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has proven 
powerful elites will stop at nothing to 
quench their thirst for power, includ-
ing 
President 
Biden, 
who 
issued 
through OSHA a rule that forced busi-
nesses with 100 or more employees to 
require the COVID–19 vaccine. 
Forcing workers out of a job if they 
refuse to take a jab is a wholly uncon-
stitutional power grab that violates 
Americans’ 
freedoms, 
exacerbates 
labor shortages, and intensifies the 
supply chain crisis. 
Congress occasionally gives our gov-
ernment agencies certain broad au-
thorities, and when those powers are 
abused, it is our responsibility to claw 
them back and safeguard the rights of 
American citizens. 
While 
the 
U.S. 
Supreme 
Court 
blocked President Biden’s OSHA rule, 
Congress has the authority and the re-
sponsibility to prevent any future at-
tempts by the executive branch to sub-
ject the American people to unlawful 
mandates. This is why I proudly intro-
duced H.R. 7281, the Reversing Every 
Vaccine Emergency Requirement and 
Stopping Employee OSHA Mandates 
Act. 
My bill, whose short title, is RE-
VERSE OSHA Mandates Act, amends 
the Occupational Safety and Health 
Act of 1970 to repeal the Secretary’s 
authority to issue emergency tem-
porary standards and is a commonsense 
and crucial step toward preventing fu-
ture government overreach by OSHA 
and defeating their hand in medical 
tyranny. 
It is incumbent upon Congress to pro-
hibit this dangerous abuse of power 
from further tarnishing our Nation’s 
history and subverting American work-
ers’ rights, which is why I urge all of 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to support this legislation that reins in 
OSHA and protects the freedoms of 
American workers. 
f 
PHIL JENKINS’ REMARKABLE 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the remarkable con-
tributions of Phil Jenkins, who re-
cently finished serving as managing 
and executive editor at the Free Lance- 
Star in Fredericksburg, Virginia. 
Phil gave his time, his energy, and 
his dedication to the Free Lance-Star 
for 24 years. 
‘‘Equally wise and unflappable,’’ that 
is how his colleagues describe him. ‘‘A 
trusted leader, gifted editor, and gen-
erous mentor.’’ 
When he arrived at the paper in 1998, 
Phil made sure the paper stayed at the 
top of its game. As the years went on, 
his determination guided the paper 
through difficult stretches and through 
thousands of local news developments. 
He oversaw critical investigations, 
including those related to the D.C. 
sniper trial. He managed major transi-
tions, such as shifting from an after-
noon to morning production cycle and 
moving the paper’s offices to downtown 
Fredericksburg. 
Under Phil’s leadership the Free 
Lance-Star was nine times judged as 
Virginia’s best midsize daily between 
2011 and 2020, winning first place for its 
writing, design, and photography. 
In Fredericksburg, Phil supervised 
dozens of people, including writers, 
photographers, designers, editors, web 
producers, and clerical staff. Those who 
worked with him over the years said 
that ‘‘few knew a more journalistically 
savvy, 
more 
evenhanded 
or 
more 
calming influence in the newsroom.’’ 
When asked to describe Phil’s tenure 
at the paper, a former colleague said 
that Phil showed ‘‘unparalleled leader-
ship’’ as well as ‘‘an uncanny ability to 
measure and satiate the community’s 
hunger for the news that makes it 
unique.’’ 
Today, Phil’s staff and the entire 
greater Fredericksburg region and the 
Free Lance-Star readership will great-
ly miss Phil’s hand at the helm of the 
Free Lance-Star. 
One former Free Lance-Star editor 
said, ‘‘Working with such a gifted jour-
nalist and wonderful person as Phil 
Jenkins was one of the highest honors 
of my life. There is no way to ade-
quately thank him for the contribu-
tions he has made to the paper and to 
the community.’’ 
Phil’s service to the Fredericksburg 
area and Virginia overall speaks to the 
enduring importance of local news, in-
cluding print journalism. Local news 
keeps us informed about the day-to-day 
events in our communities. It allows us 
to share the triumphs of our neighbors. 
It holds those in power to account, and 
it brings to light the challenges we face 
together, as a community, as a Com-
monwealth, and as a country. 
As another former colleague said, 
‘‘Nobody gave more to the cause of 
community journalism than Phil Jen-
kins.’’ 
Today, on the floor of the U.S. House 
of Representatives, I would like to 
thank Phil Jenkins for his service to 
the people of Virginia. We thank him 
for his devotion to his colleagues, his 
commitment to accuracy, and his love 
of a good story founded on the truth.

RECOGNIZING BILL SHUGARTS 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Seventh Dis-
trict constituent and U.S. Army vet-
eran Bill Shugarts. 
Bill is a Vietnam veteran who served 
with the 23rd Infantry Division. In 
Vietnam, Bill planned and ran convoys, 
and one day, while doing command and 
control above the Hiep Duc Valley, Bill 
was in a helicopter crash. Thankfully, 
he suffered only minimal injuries. 
Bill was honorably discharged in 1971 
with various commendations and med-
als, including a Bronze Star with two 
oak leaf clusters. He began a successful 
corporate career spanning three dif-
ferent Fortune 500 companies. 
But never forgetting his experiences 
in Vietnam or with his soldiers, Bill 
has devoted himself to his fellow vet-
erans and our Nation’s allies who have 
stood by our servicemembers. 
In service to the community and 
local veterans, Bill founded the North-
ern Virginia Military Ministry Out-
reach, and he cofounded the Fawn Lake 
Veterans Group. He is a docent at the 
U.S. Army Museum, and he is a lay 
leader of the Methodist Wilderness 
Community Church’s military min-
istry. 
In my earliest days in office, and well 
before the final exit of American forces 
from Afghanistan, Bill was working to 
bring attention to the urgent needs of 
the SIV program. As a founding mem-
ber of No One Left Behind, Bill focused 
on increasing the number of visas 
available, speeding up processing, and 
bringing refuge to those in danger. Bill 
worked closely with my office as we 
strived to make progress, get questions 
answered, and ultimately get SIVs 
home to America, their new home. 
Now, through their church, Bill and 
his wife, Margene, continue their tire-
less work to help Afghan evacuees re-
settle and build community in their 
new home in Virginia. 
Bill represents the best of Virginia, a 
Commonwealth made stronger through 
our ability to keep our promises to our 
veterans, our military families, and 
our allies. As the U.S. Representative 
for Virginia’s Seventh District, I thank 
Bill Shugarts for his advocacy, his 
compassion, and his deep and abiding 
sense of service to our country and our 
Commonwealth.

HONORING VETERANS BY 
EXPANDING CARE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to thank every 
single veteran in New Mexico and na-
tionwide for their service and sacrifices 
to our country. 
But we cannot only thank our vet-
erans for their service. We must honor 
their service by providing veterans the 
services they have earned. 
In 2018, President Trump’s VA began 
a process under the Asset Infrastruc-
ture Review Act to develop a list of 
recommendations to modernize and re-
align VA medical facilities. 
Two weeks ago, the VA released its 
recommendations to the Infrastructure 
Review Commission and proposed the 
closure of four community-based out-
patient clinics in rural areas of my dis-
trict, closing the Gallup, Las Vegas, 
Raton, and Espanola clinics. 
Combined, these four clinics serve 
thousands of veterans in predomi-
nantly Hispanic and Native American 
communities. Hispanics and Native 
Americans serve our country at higher 
rates. We are incredibly patriotic. 
The VA wrongly assumes that these 
patriotic veterans can receive care 
from other community providers. They 
fail to understand that, in our rural 
areas, there aren’t enough healthcare 
providers. The VA clearly doesn’t seem 
to understand rural America. 
The VA’s own report listed veterans’ 
statements that they have serious 
issues driving long distances for care 
and can’t receive critical care and 
quality care in many areas due to lim-
ited community providers. While these 
were listed in the report, the VA may 
have listened, but I don’t think they 
heard. But I do hear. I hear my vet-
erans and their stories. I hear their 
needs. 
I heard Harry. Harry is a 75-year-old 
Cold War veteran who is also a cancer 
survivor. He is a survivor today be-
cause his clinic doctor, Dr. Gomez, en-
sured Harry received a biopsy, and he 
received it quickly. It caught his can-
cer and saved his life. The clinic doctor 
knew Harry. He knew his history and 
could respond quickly to Harry’s con-
cerns. Harry told me: ‘‘It was my pleas-
ure serving this country, but the thing 
is that they need to take care of us.’’ 
Chris, another veteran I spoke to, 
told me: ‘‘Congress is quick to send us 
to 
war, 
but 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
healthcare, the government is severely 
lacking.’’ 
Shirley cried as she told me she be-
lieves she is alive today because she 
could drive herself to the clinic where 
she was immediately triaged, sta-
bilized, and sent to a hospital for the 
chest pains she was experiencing. Her 
heart still beats today because of that 
clinic. 
It breaks my heart that after all that 
these brave veterans have done for us, 
we are abandoning them just because 
they live in rural America. 
I know how my communities struggle 
to receive care and the toll it takes on 
their loved ones to take a full day off 
work to drive them 6 hours just to 
draw labs or to have an annual checkup 
when it could be done in 25 minutes or 
less in town closer to where they live. 
Some veterans would be forced to drive 
those 6 hours round trip for care at the 
VA hospital in Albuquerque, which is 
itself overwhelmed, where veterans 
wait months for appointments. 
Do you know what? The VA never 
spoke to the local Espanola VA clinic. 
I did. The Espanola clinic doctor told 
me that other local clinics are not spe-
cialized to the unique needs of veterans 
and don’t understand the mental toll 
that military service has had on our 
veterans. He asked: ‘‘Don’t veterans de-
serve more?’’ 
Veterans do deserve more. 
I have traveled to rural parts of my 
district to meet with veterans and hear 
what they need. The veterans I spoke 
to were upset, and rightly so. I am 
upset, too. They gave years of their 
lives in service to our country. 
It is our Nation’s solemn obligation 
to provide veterans the healthcare, 
education, 
housing, 
and 
honorable 
services they have earned, regardless of 
where they live. 
This is about respect. This is about 
service. This is about saving lives. 
I will not stop until we convince the 
VA and, when it gets to him, President 
Biden to reject these recommenda-
tions. 
Instead of closing clinics, we should 
be expanding care and services to our 
veterans, meeting their needs wherever 
they happen to live—in cities, suburbs, 
or beautiful rural America and rural 
New Mexico. 
That is how we truly thank our vet-
erans. 
CONGRATULATING U.S. MEN’S 
NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
congratulate 
the 
United 
States men’s national soccer team on 
qualifying for the 2022 World Cup this 
November in Qatar. 
Last night, the U.S. men’s national 
soccer team completed their qualifying 
campaign in Costa Rica. It was a fit-
ting ending to the team’s qualifying 
run, filled with ups and downs and ex-
citing matches, including big wins over 
Mexico, Panama, Jamaica, and Costa 
Rica. 
After missing out on the 2018 World 
Cup, the United States team is headed 
back to the World Cup for the first 
time in 8 years. 
From day one of the 2022 qualifying 
campaign, Coach Gregg Berhalter and 
the team set out on one mission and 
one goal, and that was to qualify. Bol-
stered by a golden generation of young 
and exciting talent, including players 
such as Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, 
Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams, Tim 
Weah, and many others, the U.S. put 
together a strong qualifying perform-
ance, including an undefeated record 
against the Mexican national team this 
past year, which is the first time that 
has been done in decades. 
I am proud that Illinois is home to 
the United States Soccer Federation, 
which supports our men’s and women’s 
programs at all levels. 
I know I join with many in Congress 
and across the country in congratu-
lating the U.S. men’s national soccer 
team. This qualification is a well-de-
served result that is a testament to the 
hard work put in by all of U.S. soccer 
and the men’s team. 
The team has made their country 
proud, and I look forward to cheering 
them on at the World Cup in Novem-
ber.

A NEW DAY FOR TRANSIT IN NEW 
YORK CITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I have 
the privilege of representing two his-
toric and iconic districts in the 13th 
Congressional District. 
Harlem is the center, the mecca, of 
the African-American diaspora. It is 
the center of culture, of music, of lit-
erature for the Black community with 
the Apollo, the Schomburg, and other 
great historical institutions. 
The other neighborhood that I rep-
resent, Mr. Speaker, is East Harlem, El 
Barrio, which is the launching pad for 
the Latino experience in New York 
City. It was the home, the cradle, for 
the Puerto Rican community that 
opened its doors to Dominicans, Ecua-
dorians, 
Colombians, 
Central 
and 
South Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4016 
March 31, 2022 
They really are two historic districts 
within the 13th Congressional District. 
Today, we mark a new day for those 
two communities with regard to tran-
sit access. 
This 
week, 
President 
Biden 
an-
nounced and submitted to Congress a 
strong and visionary budget. It in-
cluded $4.5 billion for the Capital In-
vestment Grant program, which in-
cludes $400 million for the construction 
of the second phase of the Second Ave-
nue subway extension. 
The first phase was completed not 
too long ago, several years ago, and it 
went from 96th Street south to 72nd 
Street, touching some of the most af-
fluent ZIP Codes in the country. 
This phase, the second phase, will go 
north to 125th Street. Some people 
have categorized it and called it Up-
town Grand Central. It would connect 
East Harlem, El Barrio, and Harlem at 
125th Street to the rest of the world. 
These stops will connect a transpor-
tation desert where over 75 percent of 
its residents use public transportation 
to the Lexington Avenue line, which is 
the most overcrowded subway line in 
the city, if not the country. 
East Harlem, as I said earlier, is cur-
rently a transportation desert, and this 
second phase will change the lives of 
over 100,000 New Yorkers who will use 
it on a daily basis. 
This phase will extend train services 
to 96th Street and 125th Street, a 2- 
mile stretch, and benefit thousands 
upon thousands of New Yorkers. But it 
would also connect to Metro-North, a 
total of 124 stations in seven different 
counties in upstate New York, subur-
ban New York, as well as Connecticut. 
As such, it will also connect folks to 
LaGuardia Airport via bus and future 
water transportation in the Hudson 
River and Harlem River. 
This is truly a regional project that 
will connect Harlem and East Harlem, 
El Barrio, to the rest of the world. 
I am happy and proud that President 
Biden included $400 million for the sec-
ond phase of the Second Avenue sub-
way. 
The first phase saw 160,000 people 
benefit on a regular basis, $842 million 
in wages, and $2.87 billion in economic 
activity in that region. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see this 
new initiative. 
I thank President Biden for bringing 
the second phase of the Second Avenue 
Subway to the 13th Congressional Dis-
trict.

SOUTHERN BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, the Presi-
dent of the United States takes an 
oath, promising to faithfully execute 
the office that he holds. That is a 
promise to uphold and defend the laws 
of this country and to protect our Na-
tion’s citizens. But President Biden 
seems determined to violate that oath 
when it comes to enforcing our immi-
gration and asylum laws. 
There is an undeniable crisis at our 
southern border, and it is a direct re-
sult of President Biden’s halting of the 
construction of the border wall, ending 
the remain-in-Mexico policy and re-im-
plementing catch and release. 
Now, instead of taking steps to rec-
tify the situation that he has created, 
President Biden is preparing to pour 
fuel on the fire by lifting Title 42. Title 
42 is essential to ensuring the imme-
diate expulsion of illegal aliens. And 
officials within the President’s own De-
partment of Homeland Security are 
sounding the alarm. Officials have said 
that if this policy is revoked, it would 
cause a massive run on the border, 
even worse than we are seeing right 
now, resulting in upwards of 18,000 ille-
gal crossings a day. That is 6.5 million 
illegal immigrants crossing every year. 
State and local governments, espe-
cially school districts across the coun-
try, are being overwhelmed. Customs 
and Border Protection can barely keep 
up as it is, let alone with that kind of 
surge. President Biden is failing the 
American people and his neglect at the 
border is having catastrophic con-
sequences. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to talk about So-
cial Security and its importance to the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, everybody is alarmed 
by the fact that we have been dealing 
with a global pandemic. That global 
pandemic, commonly referred to as 
COVID, has taken close to a million 
lives in the United States of America. 
Over 700,000 of those lives are individ-
uals over the age of 65. 
The COVID pandemic has also turned 
the economy upside down and has led 
to a period of inflation. And during 
that period, the group that is impacted 
the most as well are seniors in Amer-
ica. It is people that are on fixed in-
comes that need our help directly. 
There are more than 10,000 baby 
boomers a day who become eligible for 
Social Security. And for about 40 per-
cent of senior beneficiaries, Social Se-
curity provides the majority of their 
income. And for one in six Americans, 
it provides more than 90 percent of 
their income. And yet, shamefully, the 
United States Congress has not taken 
action on this in more than 50 years. 
Today, and every day, you can hear 
Members come to the floor and talk 
about their concern for our constitu-
ents; most notably, the elderly and 
even more poignantly, the veterans. 
More veterans rely on Social Security 
disability than they do on the VA. And 
yet, Congress has not addressed this 
issue in more than 50 years. The last 
time Congress addressed this issue, 
milk was 72 cents a gallon. Everybody 
knows that those prices have become 
so high today that it causes seniors to 
have to put food back on the grocery 
shelves because they can’t afford it. 
This is especially true for people of 
color. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend our former 
leader, John Lewis, who pointed out 
and said that Social Security is the 
next Civil Rights Movement because of 
the discrimination that is taking place 
within Social Security. And because 
also, people have come to rely on it be-
cause it is a guarantee. 
We don’t have to go back to 1929 and 
the great crash. We only have to go 
back as far as 2008 and 2009 to look at 
what happened in that recession and 
find out that people’s 401(k) became a 
101(k). And yet, during that same time 
period, Social Security never missed a 
payment—not a pension payment, not 
a spousal payment, not a dependent 
coverage payment, and not a disability 
payment. 
This is not something the President 
can do by executive order, nor is it 
anything that the Supreme Court is 
going to adjudicate. This is the respon-
sibility of the United States Congress, 
and help is on the way. People are 
going to have an opportunity to vote 
on Social Security 2100, bringing Social 
Security into this century and then 
also rectifying the discrimination that 
has taken place. 
Recent polls show this: That 64 per-
cent of Black adults say securing So-
cial Security should be the top priority 
for the President and Congress to ad-
dress this year. Martin Luther King 
had a better way of saying it. He called 
it the ‘‘fierce urgency of now.’’ 
In the midst of this pandemic, re-
member this, my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle: These are your broth-
ers and sisters. These are your parents. 
These are your aunts and uncles. These 
are your co-workers. These are people 
you worship with. 
Over 5 million Americans get below- 
poverty level checks from Social Secu-
rity. Why? Because Congress hasn’t 
taken on its responsibility and stepped 
up to the plate and done what is ex-
pected of them. 
I commend JIM CLYBURN, our leader 
here, who has come out strongly in 
favor of making sure that we address 
this inequality.

their fly-in to Washington, D.C., this 
week. It was incredible to host nearly 
70 business and community leaders, 
elected officials, students, teachers, 
and staff from all throughout the Per-
mian Basin, including the University of 
Texas of the Permian Basin, engaging 
with lawmakers, advocating for their 
community and advocating for energy 
independence. Thank you to the Odessa 
Chamber president, Renee Earls, the 
Midland 
Chamber 
president, 
Bobby 
Burns, and all the fantastic staff, lead-
ers, and volunteers who helped make 
this fly-in successful. 
TITLE 42 RESCISSION 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, the 
Biden administration’s handling of the 
border crisis is not humane. It is heart-
breaking. 
Yesterday, the White House con-
firmed their intention to rescind Title 
42, one of the only policies in place 
that is helping quell the border crisis. 
This decision will have disastrous 
consequences on the already several 
million illegal immigrants who have 
flooded into this country. Human traf-
ficking and smuggling across our bor-
der have reached historic highs, and 
our border States are paying the price. 
In fact, every State is a border State. 
Texas is suffering from record-high 
levels of fentanyl and drugs pouring 
across the border, increased crime, 
high-speed chases, and more. 
DHS already lacks the capacity to 
process, retain, and apprehend illegal 
immigrants along the border. Rescind-
ing Title 42 will only double down on 
the amount of people that are illegally 
crossing the border, making it that 
much more difficult for those in the 
Border Patrol and Customs, and other 
agencies, who are trying to do their job 
to keep this country safe. 
The small communities along the 
border are already overwhelmed and 
they cannot withstand a surge of hun-
dreds of thousands of illegal migrants 
reportedly waiting on the other side of 
the border to get in once Title 42 is re-
scinded. 
Migrants will pour into this country 
in a flood as our communities experi-
ence the catastrophic results. Patrol 
facilities and local communities will 
once again be forced to absorb at least 
double the current number. Title 42 is 
the only policy that is helping. 
The administration has abandoned 
Texas, has abandoned other border 
States, and has abandoned its duty to 
secure 
our 
country. 
Making 
any 
changes to this policy will have disas-
trous consequences. 
And get this straight, I remind every-
one in this House that we still have a 
mask mandate on board aircrafts in 
this country to keep us safe from 
COVID. Yet, we are rescinding Title 42, 
also in place because of the pandemic. 
Think about that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to stand with 
us and to help come up with a reason-
able solution. Title 42 rescission is not 
that solution. President Biden must 
not rescind Title 42. 
RECOGNIZING ELIZABETH ANN MAFFORD 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a staple in the Odes-
sa, Texas, community, Ms. Elizabeth 
Ann Mafford, also known as ‘‘Ms. 
Ann’’. 
Ms. Ann recently celebrated her 10th 
work anniversary at Chick-fil-A in 
Odessa, Texas. And while this was a 
special occasion in and of itself, it 
comes on the heels of Ms. Ann also 
celebrating her 90th birthday. 
Ms. Ann is a constant in Odessa, 
Texas, bringing joy and light to every-
one she encounters. From working the 
drive-through and the front counter 
and just greeting customers on the way 
in, she continuously spreads light 
throughout the entire community. 
In a testament to Ms. Ann’s life, her 
celebration of her 10th anniversary on 
the job was recognized community- 
wide. Folks posted online in recogni-
tion of Ms. Ann’s kindness and love, 
and I would like to personally thank 
her for living the American Dream, for 
showing 
everyone 
throughout 
this 
country that even at 90 years young 
that she can still work and be a pro-
ductive member of our community, 
bringing 
so 
much 
light 
and 
joy 
throughout Odessa, the Permian Basin, 
and Texas. 
Ms. Ann, thank you for what you do 
for our community and the joy you 
spread. 
f 
OIL AND GAS REBATES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, Orange 
County families are feeling the squeeze 
of higher gas prices. As a single work-
ing mom, I share their concern when I 
fill up my minivan. We can provide re-
lief by holding oil companies account-
able. 
These 
corporations 
are 
making 
record profits, the highest they have 
been in over 7 years, even as Americans 
are struggling. And as the price of 
crude oil falls, oil and gas companies 
have refused to pass on savings to cus-
tomers. Especially as Big Oil engages 
in profiteering, they should not get our 
taxpayer dollars to line their pockets. 
Each year, the industry receives rough-
ly $650 billion in direct and indirect 
subsidies, financed by taxpayers. 
This week, I am leading an effort to 
bring legislation to the House floor 
that ends these giveaways to a profit-
able industry and instead puts these 
dollars toward helping families make 
ends meet. 
Last week, I introduced the End Oil 
and Gas Tax Subsidies Act, which 
would eliminate nearly a dozen long-
standing egregious tax breaks to the 
oil and gas industry. Healthy cap-
italism requires a level-playing field. 
For far too long, Big Oil has manipu-
lated the market in its favor by lob-
bying Congress for sweetheart deals. 
Then, they raise prices while simulta-
neously 
rewarding 
their 
executives 
with huge bonuses. 
Their record profits are proof that 
they can do without market-distorting 
government subsidies. 
Eliminating these tax breaks would 
provide approximately $60 billion in 
help to families feeling the squeeze. If 
my colleagues have the political cour-
age to stand up to Big Oil, we can 
quickly relieve the pain that Ameri-
cans feel at the pump. I am ready.

CRACKING DOWN ON PORCH PIRATES 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, porch pi-
rates steal packages and make our 
communities less safe. Over 1 in 3 
Americans, myself included, have been 
a victim of this theft, which costs us 
billions of dollars each year. 
I joined Democrats and Republicans 
to introduce the Porch Pirates Act, 
which will crack down on this crime. 
This bipartisan bill expands Federal 
protections for mail and parcels to 
cover deliveries from private carriers. 
Porch pirates are committing crimes 
of opportunity, and online shopping— 
especially during the pandemic—has 
dramatically increased these opportu-
nities. I recently met with the Irvine 
police chief who described to me how 
sophisticated these bad actors have be-
come. 
Our Porch Pirates Act modernizes 
Federal law and helps keep families 
safe. 
SOCIAL SECURITY IS A PROMISE 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, Social 
Security is a promise. It is a promise 
that we make to older adults and dis-
abled Americans, people who count on 
our support. 
One of Social Security’s most impor-
tant features—one not found in tradi-
tional pensions—is that benefits auto-
matically adjust for inflation each 
year. The current level of adjustment 
isn’t working. As corporate profiteers 
drive inflation to new highs, people on 
Social Security are not even treading 
water, they are sinking. 
Democrats have a solution. The So-
cial Security 2100 Act fixes the infla-
tion adjustment. It would put more 
money in the pocket of older Ameri-
cans and people with disabilities so 
they can afford higher healthcare costs 
and other expenses. 
It would also eliminate waiting peri-
ods for people with disabilities, reduc-
ing disabled poverty. More than 200 
Members of Congress support this bill, 
and I am proud to be among them. By 
passing the Social Security 2100 Act, 
we honor our promise to older Ameri-
cans and disabled Americans.

March 31, 2022 
slow but not stop Iran’s nuclear ambi-
tions. This is so. 
Mr. Speaker, the fact is, no deal will 
include concrete guarantees that Iran 
will not develop nuclear weapons. Yet, 
in pursuit of a deal, the Biden adminis-
tration is offering concessions that will 
enrich our adversaries, endanger our 
allies, and cost America dearly. 
The whole new deal now hinges on 
delisting the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard—yes, that terrorist organiza-
tion—even as the IRGC supported at-
tacks against U.S. troops recently in 
the UAE. 
Mr. Speaker, sanctions relief will 
give Iran access to over $100 billion in 
frozen assets. That is over $100 billion 
in frozen assets to the center of ter-
rorism in the world. Nuclear trade, in 
addition, with Russia and China will 
only strengthen this unholy alliance. 
What can our allies expect from an 
Iran enriched from energy sales and 
free from sanctions? Even worse, Presi-
dent Biden is seeking to buy oil from 
Iran instead of ramping up U.S. produc-
tion. This disastrous decision, irra-
tional decision, will fill their coffers 
even more. 
We have wrecked our U.S. national 
and economic security, Mr. Speaker, by 
forfeiting our energy over the last 15 
months and our independence. We are 
now subject to the fluctuations from 
the randomness of the geopolitical 
events rather than relying upon Amer-
ican workers and American energy. 
We have cost our Nation thousands of 
jobs and empowered our enemies. We 
are seeing this firsthand with the le-
verage we have ceded to Russia because 
this administration seeks to decimate 
U.S. energy production. 
The Department of Energy is taking 
trips and seeking oil purchases from 
Venezuela. Mr. Speaker, I have not 
seen Department of Energy representa-
tives in Pennsylvania to see how the 
great reserves in the Marcellus Shale 
can 
support 
our 
country’s 
energy 
needs. 
Is the Biden administration choosing 
Venezuela over Pennsylvania? Are they 
choosing Tehran over Texas? And as 
my good friend, Representative AUGUST 
PFLUGER, branded not too long ago: 
Are they choosing Moscow over Mid-
land? 
This is the product of disastrous do-
mestic policies weakening our hand in 
diplomacy and the Biden administra-
tion rushing to negotiate from a posi-
tion of weakness. It is why our allies 
are urging us to walk away and keep 
sanctions in place on Iran. 
This deal was misguided 7 years ago. 
It is downright dangerous today. We 
need Democrats and Republicans in 
this House to stand up for America and 
against 
this 
erroneous, 
misguided, 
senseless Iran nuke deal. 
f 
HONORING MAJOR NHIA LONG 
VANG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
begin by taking a moment to remem-
ber one of my constituents who lived 
an extraordinary life, Major Nhia Long 
Vang, who recently passed away. 
Major Vang was a longtime leader in 
the Fresno Hmong community and 
bravely served alongside American sol-
diers in Laos during the Vietnam war. 
This conflict also is known as the se-
cret war in Laos. Major Vang was re-
cruited at the age of 19 by the Central 
Intelligence Agency to serve in the 
Special Guerilla Unit, otherwise known 
as the SGU, during the secret war to 
help the U.S. fight against the North 
Vietnamese Communist Army and the 
Pathet Lao Communist troops. 
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 
Major Vang led intelligence missions 
on the Ho Chi Minh Trail to gather sur-
veillance on the Communist forces. He 
also oversaw missions that rescued 
American pilots during the Vietnam 
war when their planes were shot down. 
By 1980, Major Vang’s family received 
asylum to come to the United States, 
where he would settle in Fresno in 1983. 
Once in the United States, Major Vang 
worked tirelessly to support the fami-
lies of soldiers whom the secret war in 
Laos impacted. 
Major Vang was a leader and advisor 
to organizations like the Lao Veterans 
of America and the Special Guerilla 
Units Veterans and Families. Major 
Vang was also instrumental and a part-
ner in helping my efforts to secure bur-
ial rights in national cemeteries and 
other benefits for Special Guerilla Unit 
veterans who fought alongside with 
American soldiers. 
It has been an honor in my career to 
get to know a hero like Major Vang 
and work with him as an advocate for 
the SGU veterans and get them the 
recognition they so deserve. 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
turn now to recognize Women’s History 
Month. While it is the end of March 
now, we so honor always the contribu-
tions that women make in our country 
and in our valley. Across the world 
they make a difference every day, as 
we know. 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to recognize just some of the so many 
talented and incredible women that I 
interact with and I get a chance to 
work with: 
Dora Westerlund is president and 
CEO of the Fresno Area Hispanic Foun-
dation. Dora has changed the lives of 
more than 15,000 Hispanic and non-His-
panic-owned businesses to become eco-
nomically self-sufficient and add to the 
vibrancy of our economy in the San 
Joaquin Valley. 
Sara Bosse serves as the public 
health director for Madera County. 
During this pandemic she has been in-
credibly responsive and led the coun-
ty’s response to combat COVID–19 by 
expanding testing, vaccinations, and 
managing the outbreaks in Madera 
County. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize 
Gammelah Mohammed of Merced who 
founded the Merced County Freedom 
Coalition, which fosters collaboration 
between law enforcement, government 
agencies, and other community part-
ners in the fight against human traf-
ficking. As co-chair of the Victims 
Rights Caucus, I know her efforts are 
very important. She has provided es-
sential resources to support survivors 
and victims of crime. 
AMERICA’S SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I now want 
to turn to an important issue that is 
affecting our economy, and that is the 
supply chain issue. Congress can take 
effective action by cracking down on 
foreign-owned shipping companies that 
have monopolized the industry and 
that are creating inflationary pres-
sures. 
My bill, the Ocean Shipping Anti-
trust Enforcement Act, subjects for-
eign-owned ocean shipping carriers to 
American antitrust law, as they should 
be. This builds on provisions in the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act that Rep-
resentative GARAMENDI and I and oth-
ers are supporting that has already 
passed the House. 
Together, these pieces of legislation 
protect American exporters from un-
fair trade practices like container rate 
increases, sudden change in shipping 
schedules, unreasonable fees by ship-
ping companies, and ships leaving ports 
with empty containers after they have 
offloaded their goods here in America. 
Agricultural producers in California 
are suffering. A University of Cali-
fornia study found that in the fall of 
2021, an empty container leaving Cali-
fornia ports hit almost 80 percent, pre- 
pandemic it was about 30 percent. This 
is an unfair trade practice. 
President Biden said in this very 
Chamber during the State of the 
Union—on the topic of ocean shipping 
reform—that capitalism without com-
petition is exploitation. It is. We must 
answer the President’s call to get this 
meaningful ocean shipping reform leg-
islation to his desk. 
GOD BLESS UKRAINE 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, let me 
close by saying, God bless the people of 
Ukraine and the suffering during this 
horrific war taken on by the pariah 
Putin, who is a war criminal and must 
be punished for it. God bless them.

TRIBUTE TO DON YOUNG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) for 5 
minutes. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to give tribute to Con-
gressman Don Young. 
For almost 50 years, Congressman 
Don Young proudly represented all 
Alaska. The dean of the House, as he 
was affectionately known, was the 
ninth-longest tenured Member of Con-
gress. His passing last week leaves a 
huge void for his constituents, for this 
body, and certainly for so many of us 
who had the honor of personally know-
ing Don. For me, personally, I thought

he was a mentor for many of the issues 
that we shared together. 
Our paths first crossed when I was 20 
years old and I was elected among a 
group of fellow young Republicans to 
meet Congressman Young when he vis-
ited the island to discuss its future po-
litical status. It was in that moment 
when I was able to witness firsthand 
his loyalty to the causes he deeply 
cared about, including Puerto Rico’s 
quest for statehood. 
Little did I know at that time that I 
would have the fortune and honor to 
serve alongside him in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, and to sit on the 
two committees he ever served on and 
chaired, the Natural Resources and the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committees. 
Congressman 
Don 
Young 
had 
a 
unique perspective when it came to 
Puerto Rico’s fight for statehood and 
full equality as American citizens. He 
could relate because he moved to Alas-
ka shortly after it was admitted into 
the Union as the 49th State. 
As Alaska’s sole Representative in 
the House, he understood better than 
anyone else the inequities under the 
territorial status and the opportunities 
that statehood brings. He knew what 
kind of fight we would be in for, and he 
was with us every step of the way. 
He understood the difficulties of rep-
resenting a non-contiguous district 
here in this body, and because of this, 
Puerto Rico found in him an imme-
diate ally. He frequently visited the is-
land and even served as an election ob-
server in one of our most recent ref-
erendums, demonstrating once again 
his longstanding commitment to ensur-
ing the island’s 3.2 million American 
citizens had their voice heard. 
When former Speaker Paul Ryan was 
giving a tribute to Congressman Don 
Young when he became the dean of the 
House, he said: You always knew where 
he stood, but more importantly, you 
always knew where you stood with 
him. And that is because he made no 
secret of his politics or his opinion. 
He was a staunch supporter of uti-
lizing domestic energy and mineral 
production and infrastructure develop-
ment to spur economic growth. He also 
fiercely 
defended 
Alaska 
Natives’ 
rights and worked tirelessly to ensure 
they were enabled to improve their 
lives and economic status. He was a 
loyal friend to organized labor and to 
his fellow veterans. 
Congressman Don Young was a legis-
lative force of nature. He was the pri-
mary sponsor of 123 bills that were en-
acted into law, including legislation 
for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in his 
first year in Congress. More often than 
not, he crossed the aisle on bills such 
as the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act, women’s rights, such as the 
Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, 
and the Magnuson-Stevens Act, other-
wise known as the Young-Studds bill, 
which revolutionized Federal fisheries 
management and preserved the com-
mercial fishing industry in Alaska and 
across the country. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Congressman 
Don 
Young’s legacy will live on in every 
Alaskan, every Member who has served 
with him, and every staffer who has 
been fortunate to learn from him. 
His passing leaves a big void. He 
touched our lives deeply in so many 
ways, and this House will never be the 
same without Don. 
I pray for his wife, Anne; Congress-
man Young’s two daughters; and his 
grandchildren. 
Godspeed, Don Young, and gracias.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, March is Women’s History 
Month, and I can’t let this month pass 
without 
highlighting 
two 
barrier- 
breaking public servants. 
So many women have contributed 
greatly to Louisiana, but today, I want 
to take a few moments to celebrate 
two: Councilwoman Dorothy Mae Tay-
lor and Congresswoman Lindy Clai-
borne Boggs. 
A New Orleans teacher and activist, 
Dorothy led a fight for equality within 
the segregated school systems while 
serving as a PTA president. Under her 
leadership, the city’s Black and White 
schools finally achieved equal funding. 
While I didn’t know it at the time, 
my educational experience as a boy 
growing up in New Orleans in the six-
ties 
and 
seventies 
would 
improve 
thanks to the work of Mrs. Taylor. 
During the civil rights movement, she 
successfully fought to desegregate New 
Orleans recreational facilities and reg-
ister African-American voters. 
She was a woman of many firsts: the 
first woman of color to be elected to 
the Louisiana House of Representa-
tives; 
the 
first 
African-American 
woman to hold the head of a State de-
partment; and the first Black woman 
and one of the first two women to serve 
on the New Orleans City Council, in 
1986. 
Councilwoman Taylor worked issues 
like criminal justice reform before 
they were popular. After a century of 
segregation, 
she 
was 
the 
first 
councilmember to move on a proposal 
to ban discrimination in Mardi Gras 
krewe membership, a move that paved 
the way for their eventual desegrega-
tion. 
I was elected to the New Orleans City 
Council in 1994, the year that Council-
woman Taylor retired, but I am so 
grateful to have known her and to have 
had an opportunity to learn from her 
many pearls of wisdom. 
Though she passed in the year 2000, 
she left a lasting mark on New Orleans, 
Louisiana, and our country. 
Congresswoman Lindy Boggs lived a 
life of service and warmth, unafraid to 
break the glass ceiling while over-
coming great personal loss. 
Her husband, the Honorable Hale 
Boggs, served in Congress for decades 
until his tragic death in a plane crash. 
Following his passing, Lindy Boggs re-
placed him as Congresswoman Boggs 
and became the first woman ever elect-
ed to Congress from the State of Lou-
isiana. 
It takes a lot of inner strength to do 
that, strength we also see today from 
our current colleague serving as a 
Member of Congress from Louisiana, 
Congresswoman JULIA LETLOW. 
In this very Chamber, Congress-
woman Boggs fought tirelessly for 
equal rights for women and minorities. 
She also fought to make the House of 
Representatives more welcoming to 
women, successfully advocating for a 
women’s-only space in a governing 
body that was more than 96 percent 
male. That room still exists today and 
is appropriately named the Lindy Clai-
borne Boggs Congressional Women’s 
Reading Room. 
Throughout her life, Congresswoman 
Boggs famously opened her home, her 
kitchen, and her heart to the people of 
Louisiana and the community she 
loved so much. 
She passed in 2013, but we all uplift 
the memory of Congresswoman Boggs 
and Councilwoman Dorothy Mae Tay-
lor for advancing issues that they had 
committed their entire lives to pro-
tecting and advancing voting rights, 
fighting against discrimination, pro-
viding healthcare to underserved mem-
bers of our community, and fighting 
for humanity for people everywhere. 
In the spirit of the Honorable Lindy 
Boggs and the Honorable Dorothy Mae 
Taylor, we say thank you for your in-
credible service, and we will continue 
the drumbeat of these issues here in 
Congress.

ENERGY COSTS AFFECTING U.S. 
FARMERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, there 
has been a lot of talk about energy and 
energy costs in this country and, of 
course, in my home State of California, 
where you can easily find fuel over 6 
bucks a gallon. Let me translate this 
conversation into what it means for 
farmers and what farmers mean for 
food supply. 
Now, we know the United States 
farmer provides the best, the cleanest, 
the most efficient process, more grown 
per acre per unit than anywhere else in 
the world. So, it is amazing to me that, 
just a few days ago, President Biden 
announced that we are going to have 
food shortages in the world and even 
here. We are already seeing the empty 
shelves. We are already seeing the high 
prices—supply and demand for every-
thing. 
In the United States of America, food 
shortages make me ask: What are our 
priorities as a country and as a govern-
ment here or in my home State, the 
government of California?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4020 
March 31, 2022 
We are looking at energy costs. Ev-
erything requires energy when we have 
a product that goes from a field, from 
a mine, or from a manufacturer to your 
home, Mr. Speaker. The fuel costs to 
operate a tractor, a combine, the 
trucks that bring you fertilizer and 
that bring you seed, the trucks that 
take away the grown product to the 
processor, to the mill, and finally 
bringing it to your store shelf or even 
if you have it delivered to your house, 
Mr. Speaker. All those energy costs 
ripple through everything we do and 
have as citizens of this country. 
What is being done about energy 
costs? Well, I just saw a blurb a minute 
ago that the President wants to tap 
into our energy reserve, the stored oil 
that we have someplace that always 
seems to be a political football around 
here to solve some problem when it is 
really supposed to be a reserve for very 
acute times of danger for our country. 
Now, they are using it as an economic 
flattener or what have you. 
We have reserves in the ground in 
this country that we are not tapping, 
but our tone-deaf government here and 
our State of California won’t do any-
thing about that. Instead, let’s export 
it from Venezuela, and let’s export it 
from the Middle East. Maybe we will do 
something about Russia. We will see if 
that takes effect. 
We are not doing anything to help 
our own people with the energy crisis 
and energy costs here. We are dancing 
around that collectively as a govern-
ment in this administration. Why? 
What is their priority? When John 
Kerry says he hopes this thing Putin is 
doing in Ukraine doesn’t stop our abil-
ity to reach our climate change goals, 
how tone-deaf are these people? Are 
you kidding me? 
We are going to continue to enjoy 
even emptier shelves for our food, tires, 
and everything else because of high en-
ergy costs and a government in Wash-
ington and in Sacramento unwilling to 
do anything about it other than half 
measures or zero measures. 
What does this do to our food supply, 
as we talked about? My colleagues in 
the State legislature proposed a sales 
tax holiday, a fuel tax holiday, which 
would knock about 51 cents off of a gal-
lon of fuel. It is not the be-all or fix-all, 
but it can do something temporarily to 
help while we get our energy going 
again, supposedly. It would help. They 
turned that down. Instead, they pro-
posed a tax increase on production of 
fuel in California. Unbelievable. Damn, 
who are you guys working for? Amaz-
ing. 
In my home State, as we try to 
produce food, tens of millions of acre- 
feet of water and snow fall upon our 
State each year. We hear drought, 
drought, drought, record drought. Yes, 
it is lower than normal, but we are not 
capturing the water we can. 
We could raise Shasta Dam, a Fed-
eral project, which Federal dollars 
were put toward. We could build Sites 
Reservoir in northern California and 
add 1.5 million-acre feet of stored 
water. 
But no. They are letting the water 
get away out through the delta for sa-
linity and for fish populations that 
don’t even exist. The delta smelt is 
gone. 
The Klamath Basin up in the north, 
zero allocation for agriculture last 
year and this year. Statewide, we are 
looking at probably 70 percent of irri-
gated acres by the time it is all added 
up. They are going to be idle this year. 
What does that mean to the Amer-
ican people? That is California’s prob-
lem; you guys don’t know what you are 
doing out there anyway. Well, tomato 
production is going to be down quite a 
bit, so that means less tomato sauce 
for New York, less olives and olive oil 
for New York. 
This is what we are doing to our food 
production. Fertilizer costs are going 
to drive costs even more, and we will 
not be farming in California much 
longer.

PRESIDENT BIDEN’S BUDGET DIS-
REGARDS 
FISCAL 
RESPONSI-
BILITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
ARRINGTON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
President Biden’s own words: Show me 
your budget, and I will show you your 
priorities. 
President Biden’s budget is not only 
a reflection of his priorities; it is a 
mirror into the soul of the Democrat 
Party. Biden’s budget exposes Demo-
crat leadership’s complete disregard 
for fiscal responsibility, adding tril-
lions of dollars in new spending and 
sending us hurtling toward an incalcu-
lable national debt of $45 trillion by 
2032. 
The budget proposal includes a stag-
gering $2.5 trillion in tax hikes that 
would weaken our global competitive-
ness, stifle wage growth, and send 
prices skyrocketing even higher than 
the current 40-year high inflation. The 
result would be devastating for Amer-
ican investment, innovation, and jobs. 
The deficit spending in Biden’s pro-
posal will leave our children steeped in 
debt and at risk of an economic crisis 
they cannot borrow their way out of. 
His budget doubles down on the radical 
socialist policies, including the Green 
New Deal and its extreme environ-
mental policies and a whole-of-govern-
ment assault on oil and gas, which is 
undermining our energy independence 
and making us weaker and more vul-
nerable, like our friends in Europe. It 
also includes tax hikes that will make 
America less competitive, raising taxes 
higher than Communist China, and hir-
ing tens of thousands of new IRS 
agents to harass hardworking Ameri-
cans. 
This is his vision for a stronger and 
more prosperous America. 
While the President’s expansion of 
nondefense domestic spending is on 
pace to double over the next several 
years, 
his 
budget 
effectively 
cuts 
spending for the Defense Department 
by 4 percent. If our adversaries weren’t 
already emboldened by the disaster at 
the southern border, the debacle in Af-
ghanistan, the weak negotiations with 
Iran, or the slow and feckless response 
to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they 
certainly will be now. 
The President’s budget is not only a 
failure in the area of readiness; it is 
more advertisement of weakness in an 
increasingly dangerous world. 
Lastly, the President’s budget uses 
an outrageous budget gimmick to pre-
vent his massive, multitrillion-dollar 
Build Back Better from affecting the 
budget score. 
Mr. Speaker, if the American people 
did that—that off-balance, Enron-like 
accounting scheme—they would go to 
prison. This is not just intellectually 
dishonest; it is downright deceitful. 
From the top-line numbers to tax 
hikes, from partisan policies to bureau-
cratic bloat, President Biden’s budget 
highlights the Democratic Party’s real 
priorities: the largest expansion and 
most radical reimagination of the Fed-
eral Government in the lives of its peo-
ple.

HONORING REPRESENTATIVE 
DONALD E. YOUNG 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the legacy of my good 
friend and colleague, Congressman Don 
Young from Alaska, who sadly passed 
away the evening of March 18. 
Don was an inspirational man who 
served the people of Alaska in the 
House of Representatives for nearly 
half a century and did so with a giant 
heart and tremendous passion. 
Don cherished this institution. He 
was a strong proponent of bipartisan-
ship and civility, and he consistently 
sought to find common ground. It is 
something I always admired about him. 
There is something I want the coun-
try and the world to know: He was also 
a champion for the disability commu-
nity, and I was proud to work closely 
with Don as co-chairs of the Bipartisan 
Disabilities Caucus. 
Together, we worked across the aisle 
to break down barriers and provide op-
portunities for Americans with disabil-
ities and to raise awareness of dis-
ability issues for our colleagues. 
Don was a problem solver. He was a 
dedicated public servant. And, in many 
ways, he was larger than life. I was 
devastated to learn of his passing, and 
I am really going to miss him. He made 
a difference. 
His wife, Anne, and his children, 
Dawn and Joni, are in my prayers, as 
well as his entire family. 
Rest in peace. 
f 
AMERICA’S EXTREME ECONOMIC 
CRISIS 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, a tree is known by its fruits. Every 
policy that Biden and the Democrats 
have created is demonstrably an Amer-
ica last policy. 
They call it Build Back Better, but 
the truth is, their agenda is Americans 
last, build back broke policies. 
Americans are facing an extreme eco-
nomic crisis as a result of Democrat 
policies 
that 
President 
Biden 
and 
Speaker PELOSI have put into place. 
Skyrocketing prices at the store and 
the pump are causing Americans pain 
in 
their 
pocketbook. 
Biden’s 
out-
rageous budget is fuel on the inflation 
fire. 
President Biden and the Democrats 
in the House are deliberately bank-
rupting Americans and taking away 
their economic opportunities. What are 
we leaving behind for our children and 
grandchildren? 
Americans cannot afford the America 
last policies the Democrats have cre-
ated that have made crisis upon crisis. 
f 
RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York). Mr. 
Speaker, U.S. reliance on foreign oil 
threatens our national security, pol-
lutes our environment, and unneces-
sarily burdens our families with high 
and fluctuating gas prices. 
Americans want to make the leap to 
electric vehicles which are cleaner, 
quicker, and quieter. But the lack of 
supply and changing infrastructure is 
holding people back. 
China ranks number 1 in the world, 
controlling 80 percent of the market of 
producing raw materials in lithium ion 
batteries, the United States ranks 15. If 
we don’t move quickly, we will fall fur-
ther behind. 
I support efforts to invoke the De-
fense Production Act so President 
Biden can help domestic manufacturers 
expand the production and supply of 
critical materials and goods. 
This is a bold and necessary move 
that will accelerate the availability of 
electric vehicles and put Americans 
back to work. 
f 
ENERGY COSTS AFFECT FARMERS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Biden has been promising recently 
empty shelves, food shortages in the 
United States of America. 
American farmers are the most effi-
cient and the best in the world at what 
they do, but they can’t do it very well 
with these high energy costs. 
Fertilizer takes energy to produce. It 
takes oil to produce. When you see the 
cost increasing 51 percent, this isn’t 
just going to hit the farmers; it is 
going to hit all consumers. 
Energy costs ripple through every-
thing: planting, harvesting, delivering, 
everything. So what are we doing? 
What is our focus going to be? 
In my home State of California, 
water is being taken away from agri-
culture. We need the Bureau of Rec-
lamation and our own State water re-
sources to be focused on producing food 
for people. 
In Ukraine, those farmers are trying 
to plant amidst bombs from Putin and 
Russia. In our own country, in my own 
home State, the bombs are being 
dropped by the government on farmers, 
having their water taken away, having 
their energy costs go through the roof. 
We have to focus on producing energy 
and food for Americans that is afford-
able instead of this direction that the 
Federal and my own State government 
are doing to the people and not for 
them.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to pay tribute to an American pa-
triot and a prominent fixture in my 
community, retired Major General Nor-
bert Rappl, who passed away earlier 
this month. 
General Rappl was a courageous vet-
eran who dedicated his life to serving 
our great Nation in the United States 
Army. 
A Korean war veteran, 
he 
rose 
through the ranks, retiring as Com-
mander of the 98th Training Division of 
the United States Army Reserves. We 
are deeply grateful for his service. 
Upon returning home, General Rappl 
turned his dedication to his commu-
nity, and my hometown of Irondequoit, 
becoming a charter member and past 
president of the Irondequoit Rotary 
Club chapter. 
His never-ending devotion to serving 
others was his life’s calling and is a 
key piece of his legacy that will never 
be forgotten. May he rest in peace.

VIETNAM VETERANS DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, this past Tuesday was 
Vietnam Veterans Day. The day was a 
reminder that our freedom is not free.

March 31, 2022 
We stand together to thank and 
honor Vietnam veterans and their fam-
ilies for their service and their sac-
rifice. Across the country, we paused 
and remembered the service and sac-
rifices made. 
Tuesday, in Indiana County, in the 
Pennsylvania 15th Congressional Dis-
trict, the Historical and Genealogical 
Society hosted their second annual 
program 
featuring 
guest 
speakers, 
music from the era, and an historical 
display relating to the Vietnam Memo-
rial in Washington, D.C., called ‘‘The 
Wall that Heals.’’ 
Vietnam Veterans Day and the pro-
grams are dedicated to honor the vet-
erans who served Active Duty in the 
United States Armed Forces from No-
vember 1, 1955, to May 15, 1975, the time 
period in which the U.S. had soldiers 
deployed. 
In addition to a pinning ceremony for 
Vietnam 
veterans 
in 
attendance, 
wreaths will be placed remembering In-
diana County residents who were killed 
in the line of duty or named as missing 
in action during the war. 
Mr. Speaker, events like the program 
in Indiana County are a great way for 
our younger generation to learn and 
our older generations to be remem-
bered. It is important we always find 
time to thank and honor our veterans 
for their service to our great Nation. 
To my friends who are Vietnam vet-
erans, welcome home.

REMEMBERING UKRAINE 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, it has been 5 
weeks since Vladimir Putin launched 
his assault on Ukraine and its people; a 
relentless churn of cruelty, of war 
crimes, crimes against humanity. 
More than 4 million people have fled 
Ukraine, but tragically, not everyone 
has found refuge. More than 1,000 civil-
ians have been murdered, and that 
number grows. 
On Monday, there were more than 40 
shellings by Russian troops in and 
around Kyiv, destroying homes, and in 
one case, killing a child in his own bed. 
The children. There have been 145 
children known dead, a likely horri-
fying undercount. Innocent children, 
unarmed civilians. The horror con-
tinues. 
We must continue to support Ukraine 
and provide all necessary aid. We must 
not lose sight of the people. 
Pennsylvania is home to more than 
122,000 Ukrainians, the second most of 
any State, and my district is home to 
a dynamic Ukrainian-American com-
munity, many with family in Ukraine. 
I think of them. I think of Ukraine 
every day. The world must stand 
united to end this series of war crimes. 
‘‘Glory 
to 
Ukraine.’’ 
‘‘Slava 
Ukraini.’’ 
‘‘Glory 
to 
the 
heroes.’’ 
‘‘Slava 
heroyam.’’ 
HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY, MARINA 
METEVELIS 
(Mr. HERN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, a very spe-
cial friend and constituent of mine 
turned 100 years old last week. Her 
name is Marina Metevelis, but back 
home, she is better known as Tulsa’s 
‘‘Rosie the Riveter.’’ 
Marina took the iconic red bandana 
for the first time and wrapped it 
around her head when she was 16 years 
old in 1941, when she reported to work 
on the B–17 Flying Fortress bombers in 
the aftermath of the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. 
Marina joined the ‘‘Rosie the Riv-
eter’’ sisterhood that day and stood 
shoulder to shoulder with an army of 
extraordinary women who became the 
most formidable munition and war sup-
ply manufacturers in modern history. 
They played an integral role in World 
War II, for which the entire world is 
grateful. 
Marina still wears the red bandana to 
this day. She hasn’t slowed down for 
one second, working to forge a better 
community for Tulsa and continuing 
her lifelong mission to support our vet-
erans by raising funds for numerous 
veteran organizations. 
Happy birthday, Marina. Thank you 
for your service to our Nation, and 
may God bless you. 
f 
CAPPING THE PRICE OF INSULIN 
(Mrs. TRAHAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of something every single 
Member of this body should be able to 
get behind, capping the price of insulin 
at $35 a month. 
In my home State of Massachusetts, 
over half a million people rely on their 
lifesaving 
insulin 
prescription. 
But 
being forced to pay anywhere from $100 
to $1,600 a month for it simply isn’t do-
able for so many families. 
Far too many diabetics are being 
forced to ration their doses, and some 
are even skipping them altogether be-
cause they can’t afford the medicine 
they need. 
Let’s be clear about what that 
means. Hardworking folks are risking 
their lives each day because big phar-
maceutical companies are putting prof-
its first. 
We have the ability to change that 
with the legislation before us today, 
Mr. Speaker. And shame on us if we 
stand by and do nothing while people 
we have the honor to represent die 
waiting for Congress to act. 
I plead with my colleagues to join me 
in supporting this important legisla-
tion. Our constituents are depending 
on us.

PREPARING OUR COUNTRY FOR 
THE FUTURE 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
today the House will take a historic 
step toward restoring American manu-
facturing leadership by voting to go to 
conference on the COMPETES Act. 
This bold bill makes much-needed in-
vestments in research, innovation, and 
manufacturing that will ensure Amer-
ica can outcompete any nation in the 
world now and for decades to come. 
The package will accelerate domestic 
production of semiconductor chips, the 
key component of everything from cars 
and computers to communications and 
clean energy systems. It will strength-
en the supply chain to make more 
goods in America. It will create jobs 
and support new skill-building appren-
ticeship programs, and it will support 
strong labor and environmental stand-
ards. 
What’s more, the bill and its provi-
sions have received bipartisan support, 
both here in the House and over in the 
Senate. You heard that right, Congress 
is delivering investments that will pre-
pare our country for the next genera-
tion of success.

CONGRATULATING 
APR 
SUPPLY 
COMPANY ON 100 YEARS IN BUSI-
NESS 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate APR Supply 
Company on the occasion of their com-
pany’s 100th year in business, which is 
a milestone that not many companies 
achieve. 
APR Supply Company is a third-gen-
eration-owned-and-operated 
full-serv-
ice distributor of plumbing, HVAC, and 
hydronic supplies, supporting countless 
companies through their 38 locations in 
my district and in other areas of Penn-
sylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. 
In America, the entrepreneurial spir-
it has led many to pursue founding a 
business. Over the years some may suc-
ceed, some may fail, but to celebrate 
100 years is a milestone that few 
achieve, as I mentioned. This achieve-
ment signals that an organization is 
relentlessly pursuing their values and 
supporting their customers. 
I recently enjoyed visiting one of 
their facilities with third-generation 
president and CEO Scott Weaver to 
learn about their innovative inventory 
management system and their oper-
ations. 
Again, congratulations to the team 
at APR Supply and to Scott on cele-
brating 100 years in business. Best 
wishes on their continued success.

COMMENDING BOYS AND GIRLS 
CLUBS 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. Mr. 
Speaker, today I want to recognize the 
Boys and Girls Clubs of Broward Coun-
ty and Palm Beach County for over 100 
years of combined service to their com-
munities. 
Over the past half a century, both 
clubs have grown and now serve more 
than 10,000 youth in 17 cities across 
Palm Beach County and over 12,500 
youth at 12 locations across Broward 
County. Their work is critical for the 
success of the kids who need them 
most in our communities. 
Each 
young 
person 
who 
walks 
through their doors can access pro-
grams that support their academic suc-
cess, physical health, social-emotional 
well-being, 
and 
leadership 
develop-
ment. 
Most importantly, it is a safe place 
for kids to have fun, make lifelong 
friends, and to help build resiliency and 
the confidence that will serve them for 
the rest of their lives. 
The Boys and Girls Clubs Movement 
challenges each and every one of us to 
fulfill our full potential. For more than 
50 years, the Palm Beach County and 
Broward County clubs have done just 
that. I commend both organizations as 
they continue their essential work 
helping young people reach their full 
potential as productive, caring, and re-
sponsible citizens.

EXPUNGEMENT ACT; PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF 
H.R. 
6833, AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW

each place it appears and inserting (in each 
instance) ‘‘April 29, 2022’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado is recognized for 
1 hour. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee 
met and reported a rule, House Resolu-
tion 1017, providing for consideration of 
two bills. The rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 3617, the MORE Act, 
under a structured rule. The rule self- 
executes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairman NADLER, provides 1 hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, makes three amendments in 
order, and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insu-
lin Now Act, under a closed rule. The 
rule self-executes a manager’s amend-
ment from Chairwoman DELAURO, pro-
vides 1 hour of debate equally divided 
among and controlled by the chairs and 
ranking minority members of the Com-
mittees on Education and Labor, En-
ergy and Commerce, and Ways and 
Means, and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
Finally, the rule extends recess in-
structions, suspension authority, and 
same-day authority through April 29, 
2022. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are 
here today to provide for consideration 
of Chairman NADLER’s MORE Act, 
which would end decades of failed and 
unjust marijuana policy. 
Today, 18 States, two territories, and 
the District of Columbia have laws le-
galizing and regulating commercial 
cannabis, and a total of 37 States, three 
territories, and the District of Colum-
bia have laws allowing cannabis for 
medical purposes. An additional 11 
States have low-THC medical cannabis 
laws. 
This means a total of 47 States, four 
territories, and the District of Colum-
bia have laws allowing some use of can-
nabis; 97.7 percent of the U.S. popu-
lation live in these States and terri-
tories. It is clear Prohibition is over. 
Today we have an opportunity to 
chart a new path forward on Federal 
cannabis policy that actually makes 
sense. The MORE Act is about justice, 
safety, equity, and States’ rights. The 
bill would decriminalize cannabis at 
the Federal level by removing the sub-
stance from the Controlled Substances 
Act, but the bill does not force a State 
to legalize any form of cannabis. It is 
still up to the States to set their own 
policy. 
The bill also contains provisions on 
resentencing and the expungement of 
criminal records. There is no reason 
why people should still be in prison for 
low-level, nonviolent cannabis convic-
tions, or have their future predeter-
mined by a cannabis conviction. The 
war on drugs has torn many families 
and communities apart and has had a 
disproportionate impact on people of 
color. The MORE Act would allow com-
munities to start the healing process. 
By removing cannabis from the Con-
trolled Substances Act, the bill also ad-
dresses the cannabis banking problem 
that I have been working on for nearly

10 years in the form of the SAFE Bank-
ing Act. Under current law, banks and 
credit unions providing services to 
State-licensed cannabis businesses are 
subject to criminal prosecution and 
regulatory penalties under Federal law. 
Therefore, businesses which legally 
grow, market, or sell cannabis in 
States where it is legal are generally 
locked out of the banking system, 
making it difficult for them to main-
tain a checking account, access credit, 
accept credit and debit cards, meet 
payroll, or pay tax revenue. 
This has created a significant public 
safety risk, as these businesses are 
forced to operate as cash-only busi-
nesses in an industry with billions and 
billions of dollars in transactions. 
These high-volume cash businesses are 
being targeted by violent criminals and 
putting our communities at risk. 
I want to share a few examples of 
how bad the public safety issue has be-
come. 
In November 2021, over the course of 
one week in Oakland, California, more 
than 25 cannabis businesses had their 
stores vandalized and robbed and lost 
upwards of $5 million. 
A Colorado dispensary chain saw 15 
burglaries during a 90-day period in 
mid-2021, with criminals driving vehi-
cles into their buildings, cutting holes 
through rooftops and walls, and at-
tacking the stores with pry bars and 
sledgehammers. 
Washington State is averaging more 
than a robbery per day at dispensaries. 
In fact, recently in The Seattle Times, 
it was reported that there were three 
deaths 
related 
to 
robberies 
of 
dispensaries—the robber, a policeman, 
and owner of a store. This is just last 
week. 
This is an untenable situation for 
these businesses, their employees, and 
their customers. If Congress fails to 
align Federal and State law, crimes 
targeting dispensaries will only get 
worse. The cannabis industry remains 
one of the fastest-growing industries 
and now supports more than 428,000 
jobs, with nearly $25 billion in State- 
legal cannabis sales per year. The time 
to pass the MORE Act and right the in-
justices in our community is now. 
This rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insu-
lin Now Act, to address skyrocketing 
insulin costs. Over 37 million Ameri-
cans have been diagnosed with diabe-
tes, and in Colorado there are over 
300,000. The Affordable Insulin Now Act 
will require Medicare Part D and 
health insurance plans to cover insulin 
and cap out-of-pocket cost-sharing at 
$35 per month. 
Prescription drugs like insulin force 
Coloradans to make difficult financial 
decisions. In a 2020 report from the Col-
orado Attorney General, approximately 
40 percent of all survey respondents re-
portedly using insulin are forced to ra-
tion their use of this lifesaving product 
at least once a year. 
b 1230 
I am proud of the steps Colorado has 
taken to ensure individuals have great-
er access to insulin. In 2021, Colorado 
became the second State in the coun-
try to limit insulin prices by enacting 
an insulin affordability program. 
No one should have to pay more than 
$35 a month for insulin. The passage of 
this legislation will lower costs for in-
sulin users and save money for hard-
working Americans. I commend Rep-
resentative ANGIE CRAIG and all of my 
colleagues for their work on this bill. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
the rule and the underlying bills, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Representative from Colo-
rado for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Today, we are here to consider House 
Resolution 1017, a rule providing for 
consideration of H.R. 6833 and H.R. 
3617. This rule makes in order no Re-
publican amendments, completely ig-
noring the flaws of each underlying bill 
and the thoughtful concerns raised by 
my colleagues. Not only do my col-
leagues not want to debate these 
issues, but they also don’t appear to 
even want to acknowledge them. 
First, I want to address H.R. 6833, the 
Affordable Insulin Now Act, which 
would require health insurers to cover 
selected insulin products without ap-
plying any deductible or imposing any 
cost-sharing in excess of $35. 
This bill is just a partisan exercise 
that will only reshuffle the decks for 
how patients pay for insulin. It is not a 
serious 
attempt 
to 
address 
rising 
prices. The price controls in this legis-
lation would be an expansive interven-
tion into the free market and will most 
likely lead to an increase in premiums 
for everyone. 
Let’s not forget, one of the reasons 
drug prices are rising is because of 
Washington and the majority’s run-
away spending leading to the greatest 
deficits in American history. Instead of 
admitting that their wildly expensive 
spending bills have caused inflation, 
my colleagues claim that companies 
have suddenly decided now is the time 
to raise prices arbitrarily. 
Congress 
cannot 
keep 
dumping 
money into the economy and then 
blaming American companies for the 
problems it creates. We need to be fo-
cusing on getting our debt under con-
trol and stop the war on American in-
dustry so that we can reduce prices not 
just on drugs but on everything. 
Furthermore, addressing only insulin 
establishes a problematic precedent 
and fails to take into account the high 
prices associated with countless other 
necessary drugs, like those for cancer, 
heart disease, and a slew of other con-
ditions. 
A sincere attempt by Congress to 
solve this problem would be to focus on 
ways to reduce pricing through mar-
ket-based forces. For example, Repub-
licans on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee have offered several pro-
posals 
which 
would 
improve 
price 
transparency so that Americans could 
see the real cost of their drugs and 
make choices accordingly. 
Instead of working with Republicans 
to advance these solutions, the major-
ity has yet again elected a go-it-alone 
approach that has yet to achieve any 
results for the American people. 
Next is H.R. 3617, the Marijuana Op-
portunity 
Reinvestment 
and 
Expungement Act, a broad bill that 
would remove pot from the list of 
scheduled substances under the Con-
trolled Substances Act and eliminate 
criminal penalties for individuals who 
manufacture, 
distribute, 
or 
possess 
marijuana. This rule makes no Repub-
lican amendments in order, which is 
proof that the Democrats just want to 
push this bill as a messaging bill. 
That said, there are several concerns 
with this bill. First, it fails to set any 
standards to prevent marijuana use by 
those most vulnerable to abuse: mi-
nors. In fact, back in September, when 
Mr. FITZGERALD offered an amendment 
to alter the definition of the term 
‘‘minor’’ to align with other provisions 
of U.S. Code, the majority voted 
against it. 
Without this amendment, crucial 
protections for our youth are left out 
of this bill. In committee, I even of-
fered a motion to consider an amend-
ment that would maintain existing 
penalties for selling pot to minors. It 
was defeated along party lines, a stun-
ning position for Democrats to take. 
But not only does this bill legalize 
pot; it creates a new government pro-
gram to assist people in opening pot 
stores. Let me repeat that: This bill 
creates a government program to help 
people open pot stores. 
This bill also ignores the issue of 
driving 
under 
the 
influence, 
even 
though driving under the influence of 
marijuana 
can 
have 
deadly 
con-
sequences, something law enforcement 
officers across America have warned 
about. 
Additionally, what happens if an ille-
gal immigrant is arrested for driving 
under the influence of marijuana? This 
is not addressed. 
Republicans 
on 
the 
committee 
sought to ensure that this bill would 
not impede the deportation of illegal 
immigrants who have been arrested for 
driving under the influence. That was 
also rejected along party lines. 
There are so many issues our con-
stituents are facing today. Yet, we are 
here, spending time considering legis-
lation to legalize pot that is not only 
flawed, but it is also dangerous. 
We could be working on lowering gas 
prices, tackling the snowballing Fed-
eral debt, or addressing the inflation 
affecting every American today. But 
instead, I guess the majority wants us 
to get as high as today’s gas prices and 
spend tax dollars on pot stores. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and 
the underlying bill. I ask Members to 
do the same, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4025 
March 31, 2022 
I remind my friend from Minnesota 
who 
was 
talking 
about 
party-line 
votes, we want to bring down the cost 
of prescription drugs, whether it is in-
sulin or across the board, which we 
have done in the Build Back Better bill 
that is sitting in the Senate, and I can 
say I think virtually every single Re-
publican voted against negotiating pre-
scription drug prices. 
If you want to talk about a free mar-
ket, then you ought to be able to nego-
tiate prescription drug prices so that 
Americans across the board get the 
best possible prices for their drugs. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
MORELLE), a prominent and distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished and, by his own ad-
mission, highly caffeinated gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER), my 
Rules Committee colleague and great 
friend, for yielding me time. 
I rise today in support of the rule and 
the underlying legislation. In par-
ticular, I would like to say a few words 
about the Affordable Insulin Now Act. 
Over the past two decades, the costs 
of prescription diabetes drugs like in-
sulin have artificially skyrocketed by 
more than tenfold. 
A few years ago, I was proud to com-
mission a report by the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform to de-
termine 
the 
extent 
of 
this 
price 
gouging and how it is affecting commu-
nities across the country, including my 
own in Rochester, New York, and the 
impact it is having on patients, espe-
cially older adults, and our uninsured 
population. The results of that review 
were staggering. 
In communities across the country, 
out-of-pocket costs have risen by 400 
percent for the Medicare program and 
beneficiaries over the last decade. The 
average price for a standard unit of in-
sulin in the United States was more 
than 10 times the average price in a 
sampling of 32 other countries. 
These 
excessively 
inflated 
prices 
have real consequences on how patients 
manage this chronic disease. I have 
talked with many patients and families 
in my own district that have had to ra-
tion their dose or stop taking this life-
saving and life-sustaining medication 
altogether. 
For the richest and most powerful 
nation in the world to allow this to 
continue is nothing less than shameful. 
In passing this bill, we are taking the 
first step of many to rein in these in-
flated costs and protecting patients to 
ensure the best possible health out-
comes. 
I am so proud to deliver for my con-
stituents back home, and I look for-
ward to voting for this rule and getting 
one step closer toward seeing the bill 
passed into law. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to provide for consid-
eration of Congresswoman MCMORRIS 
RODGERS
and 
Congressman 
WESTERMAN’s American Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
FISCHBACH. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
while the majority is continuing to 
prioritize things like legalizing mari-
juana, constituents in my district con-
tinue to send me photos of their energy 
bills and the prices they are paying at 
the gas pumps. 
Since President Biden took office, 
gasoline prices are up by more than 50 
percent, natural gas is up more than 25 
percent, and diesel fuel is up more than 
47 percent. These price increases are on 
top of crippling, record-high inflation 
that is a tax on the American people of 
every stripe, class, and creed. 
When adjusted for these factors, 
wages 
and 
salaries 
are 
below 
prepandemic levels. My constituents 
are pleading with Congress to focus on 
this issue and are being ignored by the 
out-of-touch majority. 
Mr. Speaker, to speak further on the 
previous question, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to op-
pose the previous question so that we 
can immediately consider H.R. 6858. 
This administration has sent des-
perate requests for oil from oppressive 
regimes like Iran and Venezuela. It is 
past time the Biden administration 
start making those frantic calls to 
Oklahoma instead of OPEC or even my 
friends in Texas instead of Tehran. 
Until that happens, gas prices will con-
tinue to soar, and hardworking Ameri-
cans will suffer. 
While Putin continues to wage war 
on Ukraine, exposing our dependence 
on Russian energy, Biden continues to 
wage war on our domestic oil and gas 
industry that provides sustainable, re-
liable energy to the American people. 
This week, Biden doubled down his 
attack by releasing a budget that in-
cludes an astonishing $45 billion in tax 
hikes on American energy producers. 
Seventy percent of goods in America 
are moved by trucks. An increase in 
gas prices will continue to be passed 
down on the food and products that all 
Americans buy. Let me be clear: 
Biden’s energy policy is hurting all 
Americans and not just at the pump. 
Whether you like it or not, tradi-
tional energy powers our country. Oil 
and gas are essential to power our 
homes and, yes, provide the energy to 
power electric vehicles. 
Biden’s war on energy poses a threat 
to all of us. It is imperative that the 
Federal Government stop villainizing 
the industry that powers our world. 
Global energy markets are com-
plicated, but one thing is certain: If 
policymakers continue to impose bar-
riers on domestic energy production, 
prices will continue to rise. Therefore, 
we need to instill confidence in the in-
dustry that plays such a crucial role in 
our economy by restoring stability and 
consistency 
with 
policies 
that 
prioritize American energy production. 
Investors and business leaders make 
their decisions based not only on the 
policies debated and voted on in D.C. 
but also on the rhetoric from public of-
ficials. What happens in this Chamber 
impacts businesses, but also what we 
go out and say on cable TV. 
Trust me, I was a business leader for 
35 years. Today’s political climate will 
directly influence future investment 
decisions, especially in heavily regu-
lated industries like energy. 
The Biden administration has been 
sending mixed messages. My colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle say they 
are concerned about the high prices re-
flected by the weak oil and gas supply, 
but their actions tell a different story. 
They aggressively push a plan to crush 
oil and gas production entirely. 
Their video simply doesn’t match 
their audio, which is why the American 
people have lost faith in Democratic 
leadership. 
We must restore sanity and pursue 
energy dominance once again on the 
world stage. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, just a couple points in 
response. 
One, we are trying to bring down the 
price of insulin—that is one of the bills 
here that we are talking about—from 
the outrageous amounts that are re-
quired for this lifesaving drug down to 
$35. Yet, my Republican colleagues op-
pose reducing that. 
They worry about inflation at the 
pump, which we all do, but it is Putin’s 
price hike. We know where this came 
from, this increase, and the President 
is working to release millions of bar-
rels of oil from our underground stor-
age, and he wants to place a price on 
leases that aren’t being used. We have 
12 million acres that are under lease 
and are not being used. That will bring 
down the price at the pump. But we 
have to defeat Putin. It is his price 
hike. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 51⁄2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN), the chairman of the 
Rules Committee. 
b 1245 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize someone who has 
made a truly exceptional contribution 
to this institution and to the work that 
goes on here, the amazing Peggy 
Fields. 
Peggy has served in the Clerk’s Office 
since 2008, first as assistant bill clerk 
and now as bill clerk, where she over-
sees an amazing team that works late

March 31, 2022 
nights and long hours to literally keep 
the House of Representatives running. 
I can spend hours talking about how 
incredible everyone in the Clerk’s Of-
fice is: 
How they have an incredible eye for 
detail and never drop the ball; 
How they seamlessly process the 
hundreds of daily submissions into the 
hopper; 
How they rose to the challenge of 
keeping this body running during a 
pandemic—implementing proxy voting 
and the e-hopper so our work could go 
on, even when it wasn’t safe for all of 
us to be here; 
And, of course, how much they be-
lieve in this institution and all that it 
represents. 
But I only have a few minutes, so let 
me just say to everyone in the Clerk’s 
Office that your work does not go un-
noticed. It is recognized by so many of 
us here in the congressional commu-
nity and beyond. 
Mr. Speaker, Peggy Fields started 
her journey to Capitol Hill 33 years ago 
when she went to work for former Con-
gressman ‘‘Bud’’ Cramer, who was then 
the district attorney of Madison Coun-
ty, Alabama. 
Congressman Cramer told me that 
when he was sworn into Congress in 
January 1991, the first employee in his 
Washington office was Peggy Fields. 
Peggy helped run that office for 18 
years, and unsurprisingly, she was be-
loved by everyone. In the Congress-
man’s 
office, 
Peggy 
proudly 
rep-
resented her hometown of Huntsville, 
Alabama. 
He told me that Peggy and her fam-
ily are renowned in Huntsville, and 
that she is and always has been de-
voted to the people of Huntsville, as 
well as her friends and family back 
home. 
In 2008, she joined the Office of the 
Clerk as an assistant bill clerk. And 
her dedication and exceptional work 
ethic earned her the promotion to bill 
clerk in July of 2021. 
As if all this were not enough, Peggy 
will soon graduate from Wesley Theo-
logical Seminary with a doctorate of 
ministry degree in church leadership. 
And I want to congratulate her on that 
incredible achievement. 
Peggy 
and 
her 
team 
have 
the 
daunting task of processing every sin-
gle bill and cosponsor form for the 
House. 
Mr. Speaker, as you know, the bill 
clerks work especially closely with the 
Parliamentarian’s office, because the 
Parliamentarian is responsible for re-
ferring all bills on the day that they 
are introduced. And the bill clerks 
process those referrals on the same day 
as well. 
Now, sometimes that means that the 
bill clerks and Parliamentarians share 
late nights together and they get to 
know each other quite well. I want to 
read a note sent over to me by the Par-
liamentarian’s office about Peggy. 
‘‘Peggy is always such a welcoming 
presence to us, both on the floor and in 
our offices. However, Peggy is so wel-
coming and kind that there is always a 
noticeable uptick in bill introduction 
whenever she is stationed on the floor. 
That is why we came to know her by 
the nickname ‘The Bill Magnet,’ we 
know that our workload increases 
whenever she is on the floor. 
‘‘However, always thinking of others, 
Peggy would make up for this in-
creased bill count by singing a cappella 
renditions of popular songs in our of-
fice while we finished up our referrals. 
She is one of a kind, the consummate 
public servant, and truly irreplaceable 
to this institution.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, at a time when there 
are a lot of challenges and uncertain-
ties in the world, here is someone who 
is doing everything she can to make 
everyone’s day a little bit brighter and 
to give back to her community and to 
her country; someone who, through her 
dogged willpower, incredible knowl-
edge, and decades of experience, tack-
les every challenge she faces with 
poise, talent, and a great sense of 
humor. 
Even on her team’s busiest days, dur-
ing their longest hours, and on their 
latest nights, and during the historic 
and often unprecedented times that we 
are living through, Peggy is a beacon 
of light, bringing camaraderie and 
positivity to everything she does. 
She has served this institution, and 
the people it represents, with integrity, 
with honor, and with skill for the past 
33 years. 
Mr. Speaker, Peggy Fields is an in-
spiration, and her career in public serv-
ice has been nothing short of remark-
able. She set out to make a difference, 
and what a difference she has made. 
On behalf of all of my colleagues and 
staff on both sides of the aisle, past and 
present, and the countless people in 
whose lives Peggy has made an im-
measurable difference, I would like to 
extend this institution’s deepest and 
most sincere thanks to Peggy and wish 
her all the best as she begins this new 
chapter. 
Thank you, Peggy. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
join the gentleman from Massachusetts 
and the entire body in congratulating 
Ms. Fields on her retirement and thank 
her for her service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the pre-
vious question so that we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 6858, the Amer-
ican Energy Independence from Russia 
Act. 
As Congress debates legalizing mari-
juana, Americans in the real world are 
facing an energy crisis that we in Con-
gress cannot afford to continue to ig-
nore. 
In my hometown of Altoona, Penn-
sylvania, the cost of gasoline is now 
$4.28 a gallon; over 50 percent higher 
than it was just one year ago. 
In rural communities, these sky-
rocketing prices are forcing families to 
make hard choices about what they 
can afford and what they cannot afford. 
Instead of working to support the 
needs of these Pennsylvanian families, 
President Biden and his administration 
have continued to work against Amer-
ican energy producers. 
On day one of his Presidency, Presi-
dent Biden made good on a longtime 
liberal wish list item. He canceled the 
Keystone XL pipeline. Now, in his 
budget, President Biden has chosen to 
put solar panels ahead of natural gas. 
He has chosen to put windmills ahead 
of coal. He has chosen the Green New 
Deal ahead of Pennsylvanians. 
Now, the President has decided to 
recklessly release oil from our stra-
tegic reserves without a concrete plan 
to refill them. This stopgap measure 
does not support our national security 
and it will do little to help lower the 
cost of fuel for American families. 
It is time to invest in American en-
ergy. It is time to return to American 
energy dominance. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, we 
are here about reducing prices on insu-
lin, something that so many Americans 
need. Yet, my colleagues want to talk 
about a bill that is not even before the 
House of Representatives today. We 
ought to be talking about reducing the 
price of prescription drugs, like insu-
lin, for Americans who need it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON), 
my 
friend, 
and 
another 
prominent member of the Committee 
on Rules. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative PERLMUTTER for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of today’s rule. The two bills in the 
rule provide for important, long over-
due reforms that most Americans are 
in favor of. The MORE Act will reform 
our Federal drug laws to bring Federal 
laws in line with the majority of States 
which are now legally and responsibly 
regulating cannabis. 
Mr. Speaker, 37 States, including the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, have 
successfully legalized medicinal can-
nabis, creating a thriving, safe, and 
legal market for cannabis, creating 
thousands of jobs and billions in new 
tax revenue. This is a rare win-win sce-
nario for everyone—government, busi-
nesses, patients, and consumers. 
However, the ongoing conflict be-
tween our State and Federal laws cre-
ates daily legal issues for businesses, 
banks, doctors, and consumers. The 
MORE Act will address these problems 
by removing cannabis from the Con-
trolled Substances Act. This will allow 
veterans to use medicinal cannabis 
without losing their VA benefits. 
It will allow legal businesses to ac-
cess financial services. It will allow 
scientists and government agencies to 
research cannabis, and it will not pre-
vent States from regulating or even 
criminalizing misuse of cannabis.

More importantly, the MORE Act in-
cludes a comprehensive package of 
criminal justice reforms to give a sec-
ond chance to those whose lives have 
been upended by the excesses of the 
war on drugs. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule also in-
cludes the Affordable Insulin Now Act, 
which will cap insulin costs at $35. This 
is a much-needed reform that will pro-
vide financial relief to the millions of 
Americans who rely on insulin to man-
age their diabetes. While I am glad 
that we are able to find compromise on 
capping insulin costs, Americans are 
demanding that we pass comprehensive 
legislation to lower prescription drug 
costs for all Americans. And we con-
tinue to invite our Republican col-
leagues to help us to do that. 
Prescription drug prices are way too 
high. Insulin is ten times more expen-
sive in the U.S. than in other coun-
tries. Across the board, Americans pay 
more for their drugs than people in 
other countries pay for the exact same 
drugs. There is no justification for this 
difference. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, the pre-
scription drug market is broken, and 
insulin is just one example of how bad 
the problem is. We urgently need pre-
scription drug price reform so all 
Americans can afford the medications 
they need to manage their health. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote for today’s rule and the 
underlying bills when they are consid-
ered on the floor. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my 
colleagues to defeat the previous ques-
tion so that we can immediately con-
sider the American Energy Independ-
ence from Russia Act. 
Gas prices are at $5 and even $6 a gal-
lon. The average household is now 
spending $2,000 more a year because of 
increased gas costs on Biden’s watch. 
Biden and the Democrats think that 
now is the time to add $45 billion in 
new taxes on the oil and gas industry. 
Many Americans have been and are 
being regulated into poverty in an un-
necessary sacrifice at the altar of cli-
mate change. 
Instead of unleashing our domestic 
oil and gas industry, Biden is ‘‘simp’’ 
to radical environmentalists and not- 
in-my-backyard extremists, and lit-
erally begged OPEC to drill more oil 
instead of relying on the hardworking 
American roughneck. 
On day one, he canceled the Keystone 
XL pipeline, killing 11,000 good-paying 
American energy jobs. But that didn’t 
stop the big guy from approving the 
Nord Stream 2 pipeline and benefitting 
our enemies. 
Because of Biden’s fake ban on Rus-
sian oil and gas, that won’t even go 
into effect for 22 more days and is lit-
tered with waivers to keep Russian en-
ergy flowing, the U.S. continues to im-
port 100,000 barrels of Russian oil and 
send them roughly $10 million each 
day. We folks are funding the Kremlin. 
Why does Biden favor foreign energy 
over domestic energy? We know that 
American natural gas is 42 percent 
cleaner than Russian gas, so it is not 
for environmental reasons. But maybe 
there is another reason we don’t know 
about. Perhaps there is 10 percent in 
this tucked away for the big guy. 
How about this: Instead of funding 
both sides of the war and playing Biden 
and Pelosi’s con games, we should re-
start construction of the Keystone XL 
pipeline, overturn Biden’s energy leas-
ing moratorium, and expedite permits 
for pipelines and natural gas exports. 
We need the American Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act and stop 
playing Biden’s energy-from-anywhere- 
but-America game. 
Mr. Speaker, America should not 
only have affordable energy for our 
own use, but we should be exporting it 
abroad. 
We 
can 
literally 
export 
strength and freedom to our allies. 
In short, the solution is very simple. 
Drill, baby, drill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. In the 
richest country in the world, we cannot 
allow healthcare to become wealth 
care; available to those who can afford 
it. 
Mr. Speaker, this is why I support 
H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin Now 
Act, because diabetes can kill, and in-
sulin can save lives, if you can get it. 
Some things bear repeating. Insulin 
saves lives if you can get it. Mr. Speak-
er, this bill will ensure that millions 
who need it will be able to get it. In the 
richest country in the world, Mr. 
Speaker, we cannot allow healthcare to 
be wealth care. 
b 1300 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON). 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the previous question so 
that we can immediately consider H.R. 
6858, the American Energy Independ-
ence from Russia Act. 
Just 1 year ago, our country was 
comfortably meeting our energy needs, 
and we were a net exporter of energy 
for the first time in 50 years. However, 
under the Biden administration, we 
have seen a continued assault on Amer-
ican energy that has killed jobs, in-
creased our dependency on foreign en-
ergy sources, and most recently jeop-
ardized our national security. 
The 
administration 
continues 
to 
block new oil and gas lease sales from 
moving 
forward, 
all 
while 
placing 
undue regulatory burdens on American 
energy development. Just this week, 
President Biden proposed $45 billion 
worth of tax increases on fossil fuels in 
his budget to further weaken America’s 
ability to power our country. 
These proposed tax increases are just 
another example of the administration 
doubling down on the anti-American- 
produced energy policies that have sent 
prices skyrocketing here at home. The 
administration’s energy agenda has not 
only undermined our country’s energy 
security, but has also forced our Euro-
pean allies to become even more de-
pendent on Russia to meet their energy 
needs. 
Instead of turning to America’s own 
energy sector to meet our energy 
needs, this administration is asking 
countries like Iran and Venezuela to 
compensate for the ban on Russian im-
ports and ignoring American energy 
producers. 
In 
doing 
so, 
they 
are 
prioritizing oil produced by dictators 
over American energy producers who 
support jobs and businesses here at 
home. 
The 
administration 
must 
reverse 
course and stop depending on foreign 
dictators to ship oil to the United 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, now is the time to flip 
the switch and reduce our dependence 
on foreign energy by unleashing Amer-
ican energy. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the 
previous question. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, 
could I inquire how much time each 
side has remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado has 10 minutes 
remaining and the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota has 131⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Affordable Insulin Now 
Act and the underlying rule. 
It is unconscionable that in the rich-
est country the planet has ever seen, 
millions of Americans, our neighbors, 
are forced to choose between buying 
medicine and paying their gas bill. 
Americans pay more than 10 times the 
price of insulin compared to other 
similar countries; 10 times. 
In fact, one in four of our neighbors 
who rely on insulin have rationed or 
skipped doses due to costs. I want folks 
to think about that. A quarter of the 
people prescribed insulin for their med-
ical condition have risked their life to 
be able to afford another month’s 
worth of insulin. This is shameful. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6833 caps out-of- 
pocket costs for insulin at no more 
than $35 per month in Medicare and 
commercial health insurance. This cap 
will be a lifesaver for millions of our 
neighbors who currently pay 10 times 
more the price of insulin compared to 
similar wealthy nations. 
How can these companies sell the 
exact same drug here for 10 times the

price of other nations? Because cor-
porate greed and price gouging are not 
just permitted in our country, but en-
couraged. The bill is not the complete 
fix, Mr. Speaker, and we must do more 
to help our uninsured. So many are 
hurt and getting sicker and even dying 
because of corporate greed and monop-
olies of Big Pharma. 
This bill is the beginning in reining 
in corporate greed and putting people 
over profits. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the previous question so 
we can immediately consider H.R. 6858, 
the American Energy Independence 
from Russia Act. 
I am a proud cosponsor of this bill 
that will strengthen our energy secu-
rity, bolster our economy, and position 
ourselves to counter Russian aggres-
sion in Ukraine. 
This morning, gas near my district 
office in Ogden, Utah, is $4.30. For the 
average family driving the average ve-
hicle in Utah, this means that each fill- 
up will cost over $110. For Utah’s hard-
working agricultural industry, this 
means thousands of dollars more will 
be spent on fuel so they can feed the 
rest of America. 
These skyrocketing prices are unac-
ceptable. I share my constituents’ out-
rage over how the Biden administra-
tion’s policies have contributed to this 
painful situation. This is a self-im-
posed tax on all Americans. For those 
of us who come from energy producing 
States, we know we can do better. 
It is past time we get back to what 
we were doing in 2019 when the United 
States was a net exporter of energy. It 
is better for our economy and our envi-
ronment when we produce domesti-
cally. In Utah, we understand this be-
cause we do this. 
Instead of allowing Americans to do 
their jobs, the Biden administration 
has shut down new oil and gas leasing. 
Instead of helping our communities 
grow, he has asked the oil cartels in 
the Middle East to pump more oil. In-
stead of investing in America, he has 
made us more dependent on energy im-
ports from Russia and other foreign ad-
versaries. We can do better. 
Passing the America Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act today will 
put us on a path toward energy inde-
pendence. I encourage my colleagues to 
join me in rejecting the previous ques-
tion so we can lower prices for all. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port this bill’s relief for Mary in Austin 
whose grandson, like so many others, 
will be able to get some relief. They 
are paying up to $300 per month for in-
sulin, and now they would pay $35 per 
month. 
But 51⁄2 million Texans and 28 million 
Americans are uninsured. This bill of-
fers them no help whatsoever. In our 
upside-down healthcare system, those 
who have the least continually get 
asked to pay the most for essential 
pharmaceuticals. Sixty-eight percent 
of those without health insurance are 
forced to pay full monopoly prices for 
their essential insulin. They are being 
denied any relief today, despite the 
fact that I and 12 of my colleagues of-
fered a simple amendment that could 
have provided that assistance. 
Nor does this bill represent the 
slightest progress toward preventing 
prescription price gouging. It is so 
true, as many have said, that many 
Americans are paying 10 times the 
price for insulin as do consumers in 
other countries. This bill does not do 
anything, however, to lower it to nine 
times. Indeed, this bill does not lower 
the price of insulin by one penny, it 
just shifts the burden of paying for the 
insulin off the shoulders of insured in-
sulin users, and shifts it on to the rest 
of us who are paying insurance pre-
miums, and will pay higher premiums 
because of this, and $11 billion more in 
costs to the taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I assume Big Pharma 
supports this bill because it is not fac-
ing any additional duty to lower its 
prices for this lifesaving product. Some 
day this Congress will break free of the 
shackles of Big Pharma, which fills 
these halls with more lobbyists than 
there are Members of Congress. 
Some day we will provide genuine re-
lief to all Americans burdened by soar-
ing drug prices, but that day, sadly, is 
not today. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the previous question so that 
we can immediately consider H.R. 6858, 
the America Energy Independence from 
Russia Act. That would not only 
strengthen our security and independ-
ence, it would lower gas prices by ap-
proving the Keystone pipeline, remov-
ing restrictions on LNG exports, re-
starting production on Federal lands 
and waters, and overall encouraging 
more American energy development. 
In the midst of skyrocketing infla-
tion and surging prices at the pump, 
along with the geopolitical context 
where Europe is dependent on Russian 
oil and gas, you would think the Biden 
administration would abandon their 
whole-of-government approach to tar-
geting American energy production. 
Since Biden took office, he has used 
every tool at his disposal to undermine 
the oil and gas industry and our energy 
independence along with it. 
In addition to the onslaught of his 
unilateral attacks, his first Presi-
dential budget was released and called 
for $35 billion in punitive tax increases 
on the oil and gas industry. His admin-
istration has weaponized and abused 
their regulatory authority to attack 
the industry at every turn; SEC reports 
for permitting on the directives, and 
EPA radical regulations. 
What is more astonishing is Biden’s 
latest budget, which is $4 trillion in 
taxes, and includes $45 billion in taxes 
on oil and gas. These are the same pro-
visions that his own party rejected and 
had to abandon their build back broke 
proposal. 
Just like he has done with the regu-
latory regime, it appears our President 
is weaponizing the tax code to cancel 
an entire sector of our economy, one 
that is paramount to our prosperity 
and security. As events around the 
world constrain supply, he seems hell-
bent to ensure that anyone but Amer-
ican energy producers, the most effi-
cient, the cleanest producers in the 
world, are positioned to supply the 
United States and our people and our 
allies around the world. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
remind my friend, Mr. ARRINGTON, that 
there are 12 million acres of nonpro-
ducing Federal land with 9,000 unused 
but already approved permits for pro-
duction. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to 
wish Mr. ARRINGTON a happy birthday. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to support H.R. 6833, and I ac-
knowledge 
Ms. 
CRAIG
and 
Mrs. 
MCBATH. I tell my friends on the other 
side of the aisle that we can walk and 
chew gum at the same time, but right 
now people are dying because they are 
apportioning or putting in proportion 
their insulin that they need—not tak-
ing the full amount, but doing it pro-
portionately. That is a death sentence. 
Let me indicate: Native Americans, 
14.7 percent diabetic; Hispanic, 12.5 per-
cent; Black Americans, 11.7 percent. 
Many of them are on Medicare and 
many of them are on Medicaid. We can 
do both. I do rise to support this legis-
lation—$35 in 2023, regardless of wheth-
er a beneficiary has reached the annual 
out-of-pocket spending; $35 beginning 
in 2024. 
It is well-known that those who had 
diabetes suffered more with COVID–19. 
This is an important step. In the 18th 
Congressional District uninsured resi-
dents paid 23 times more for the brand 
of insulin, and we must begin to work 
on that. I join with my colleagues in 
making that the next step. I rise for 
this. 
Mr. Speaker, I also rise to support 
the new response to marijuana, and to 
insist that we pass the MORE Act that 
came out of my subcommittee on the 
Judiciary Committee. 
Public support for legalization of 
marijuana has surged in the past two 
decades. A total of 47 States have re-
formed their laws. We must reform the 
banking aspect of it. We need to open 
the door to research, therapeutic treat-
ment for veterans, better banking and 
tax laws, and we need to help fuel the 
economic growth within the industry. 
We need to do this by sending dollars 
out to help our respective communities 
bring down the cost of crime, be able to

help those who are in business. We 
must do this and spend Federal re-
sources to end criminalization, build 
the economic engine, and to ensure 
that we are in step with 47 of our 
States. 
Thousands of men and women have 
suffered needlessly from the Federal 
criminalization 
of 
marijuana 
with 
mandatory 
minimums, 
particularly 
Black and Brown. All these persons in-
carcerated need to be able to be con-
structive, but they are in there on the 
false war on drugs. 
Mr. Speaker, I support both the insu-
lin bill and the MORE Act, and I ask 
my colleagues to support the under-
lying rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of 
the Rule governing House consideration of 
H.R. 3617, the ‘‘Marijuana Opportunity Rein-
vestment and Expungement Act of 2021,’’ or 
the ‘‘MORE Act of 2021.’’ 
The Rule that is being considered is care-
fully crafted and provides Members of the 
House an opportunity to address the existing 
conflict between federal and state laws regard-
ing marijuana, or cannabis, and to provide 
reasonable solutions to resolve this conflict. 
The bill is straightforward and responds to 
the need to leave the question of the legality 
of cannabis to the individual states while at-
tempting to restore and reinvest in commu-
nities that have been ravaged by the War on 
Drugs. 
Specifically, the bill decriminalizes cannabis 
on the federal level, provides a taxation struc-
ture for the sale of cannabis that will support 
a community reinvestment trust fund, and pro-
vides for expungement of convictions and ar-
rests for federal cannabis offenses. 
The Rule provides for debate and full con-
sideration of the solutions and opportunities 
for cannabis reform offered by H.R. 3617 by 
the Congress. 
The subject of the bill is public knowledge 
and well known by members of this body. 
I have worked to provide sensible reforms to 
our criminal justice system. 
Our outdated federal laws and policies un-
wisely require the expenditure of scarce law 
enforcement resources on cannabis offenses 
while conflicting with many states’ laws re-
garding cannabis. 
Cannabis does not fit the definition of a 
Schedule One drug and federal law must be 
updated to reflect this reality—just as most 
states have already begun to do. 
Thirty-seven states, the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico, and Guam have adopted laws al-
lowing medical use of cannabis. 
Eighteen states, the District of Columbia, 
and the Northern Mariana Islands have adopt-
ed laws for legalizing cannabis for adult rec-
reational use. 
As public support for the legalization of 
marijuana has surged in the past two dec-
ades, a total of 47 States have reformed their 
laws in one form or another pertaining to can-
nabis, despite its federal criminalization. 
We need to open the door to research, 
therapeutic treatment for veterans, better 
banking and tax laws, and we need to help 
fuel economic growth within the industry. 
We need to do this without continuing to 
spend federal resources on criminalization and 
unjust incarceration for marijuana offenses. 
Thousands of men and women have suf-
fered needlessly from the federal criminaliza-
tion of marijuana, particularly in black and 
brown communities. 
These individuals have borne the burden of 
collateral consequences that have damaged 
our society across generations—such as the 
denial of affordable housing, educational op-
portunities, employment, and the right to vote. 
Meanwhile, the laws enacted for the pur-
pose of perpetuating the ‘‘War on Drugs’’ have 
led America to imprison more people than any 
other country. 
The Rule allows the House to address these 
historical wrongs by voting on H.R. 3617. 
I thank the Committee on the Judiciary, on 
which I serve, for the work it has done to bring 
H.R. 3617 to the floor for a vote. 
I encourage my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to vote in support of the Rule and the 
underlying bill H.R. 3617. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise also to speak in strong 
support of the Rule governing House consider-
ation of H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin Now 
Act. 
The Rule that is being considered is well 
crafted and provides Members of the House 
an opportunity to address an urgent need of 
constituents who require life saving insulin. 
The bill is simple and gets to the urgent 
need to limit cost-sharing for insulin under pri-
vate health insurance and the Medicare pre-
scription drug benefit. 
Specifically, the bill caps cost-sharing under 
private health insurance for a month’s supply 
of selected insulin products at $35 or 25 per-
cent of a plan’s negotiated price (after any 
price concessions), whichever is less, begin-
ning in 2023. 
The bill caps cost-sharing under the Medi-
care prescription drug benefit for insulin prod-
ucts at: $35 in 2023 regardless of whether a 
beneficiary has reached the annual out-of- 
pocket spending threshold, and $35 beginning 
in 2024 for those who have not yet reached 
this threshold. 
The Rule provides for debate and full con-
sideration of the benefits offered by H.R. 6833 
by the Congress. 
The subject of the bill is public knowledge 
and well known by members of this body. 
I have worked closely with the healthcare 
community that serve Houstonians to ensure 
that programs are receiving the appropriate 
level of federal support. 
One of the most difficult challenges are the 
hurdles to healthcare created by lack of health 
insurance such as a lack of access to nec-
essary medications due to the high costs of 
many prescription drugs. 
Diabetes is a life-threatening disease that 
disproportionately 
affects 
communities 
of 
color. 
Diabetes is associated with serious health 
problems, including heart disease and stroke, 
kidney failure, and blindness. 
There are 15,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 
the Eighteenth Congressional District who 
have been diagnosed with diabetes. 
These individuals are my constituents and I 
know that on average, each of them pays 4.8 
times the cost of similar medication in Aus-
tralia, 3.6 times the cost in the United King-
dom, and 2.6 times the cost in Canada. 
Additionally, in the Eighteenth Congres-
sional District, 26.7 percent of residents are 
uninsured. 
For example, an uninsured resident of this 
congressional district pays 23 times more for 
this brand of insulin than their counterparts in 
Australia, 15 times more than they would in 
the United Kingdom, and 13 times more than 
they would in Canada. 
The consequences of these staggering 
costs are not benign. 
Many patients often speak of having to 
make heart-wrenching decisions about what to 
buy with the commonly fixed incomes attend-
ant to seniors. 
Many medical professionals indicate that the 
high prices for prescription drugs are a func-
tion of a lack of competition, and authorizing 
Medicare to create a program to negotiate 
drug prices may be an estimable way to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs. 
All told this reflects a disturbing trend: in our 
country, the cost of branded drugs tends to go 
up, whereas in other countries, the costs tend 
to go down. 
Before insulin the prognosis for diabetics 
was bleak. 
Over the past two decades, manufacturers 
have systematically and dramatically raised 
the prices of their insulin products by more 
than tenfold—often in lockstep. 
In 2017, diabetes contributed to the death of 
277,000 Americans—and was the primary 
death for 85,000 of those individuals. 
That same year diagnosed diabetes cost the 
United States an estimated $327 billion—in-
cluding $237 billion in direct medical costs and 
$90 billion in productivity losses. 
Diabetes drugs, including insulin and oral 
medications that regulate blood sugar levels, 
play a critical role in helping people with dia-
betes manage their condition and reduce the 
risk of diabetes-related health complications. 
Although insulin is the most well-known dia-
betes medication, diabetes patients are often 
prescribed other oral drugs to use in place of 
or alongside insulin. 
Many of these non-insulin products used to 
regulate blood sugar levels are brand drugs 
that lack generic alternatives. 
In recent years, the high prices of diabetes 
drugs have placed a tremendous strain on dia-
betes patients as well as the federal govern-
ment, which provides diabetes medications to 
more than 43 million Medicare beneficiaries. 
Because Medicare lacks the authority to ne-
gotiate directly with drug manufacturers, Medi-
care beneficiaries pay significantly more for 
their drugs than patients abroad. 
Patients who are uninsured or underinsured 
and must pay for their drugs out of pocket 
bear an even greater cost burden. 
The Rule allows the House to address this 
urgent need by voting on H.R. 6833. 
I thank the committees on Energy and Com-
merce, Ways and Means, and Education and 
Labor for the work they have done to bring 
H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin Now Act to 
the floor for a vote. 
I encourage my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to vote in support of the Rule and the 
underlying bill H.R. 6833. 
Thank you.

they should be demanding—that this 
body address energy independence. But 
the majority refuses to hear or even 
discuss the Republican solution that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4030 
March 31, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIF-
FANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the MORE legislation 
both for what it does and what it does 
not do. 
For starters, the bill authorizes the 
collection of detailed demographic in-
formation on marijuana-sector employ-
ees, including their race and ethnicity, 
for a massive, publicly accessible gov-
ernment database. This is another at-
tempt by Democrats to promote their 
destructive identity politics agenda 
and lay the groundwork for a rigid 
quota system that picks winners and 
losers based on skin color. 
The database will also put more sen-
sitive personal data at risk and open 
the door to mischief by Federal bureau-
crats who have repeatedly weaponized 
access to Americans’ private informa-
tion to promote a partisan political 
agenda. Hello IRS. 
I am also disappointed that the ma-
jority refused to allow votes on two 
commonsense amendments I proposed. 
The first would have required child-re-
sistant packaging and a Surgeon Gen-
eral’s warning label detailing the dan-
gers these products pose to pregnant 
women and their unborn babies. Inves-
tigative reports have revealed multiple 
instances of pot shop clerks recom-
mending marijuana to expectant moth-
ers as safe, despite well-documented 
risks. Few, if any, of these retail clerks 
have any medical training and should 
stick to dispensing pot, not prenatal 
advice. 
The second would have banned the 
use of ingredients or flavor additives in 
marijuana-infused products such as 
fruit, chocolate, vanilla, or candy. For 
years, we have been told by many on 
the other side that such flavors appeal 
to children and should be banned from 
tobacco products. If this standard is 
good enough for JUUL and Puff Bar, 
shouldn’t it also apply to Cheech and 
Chong? 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation will 
make an already complicated situation 
worse. I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule 
and a ‘‘no’’ vote on the bill. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
just remind my friend from Wisconsin 
that 47 States, every territory, and the 
District of Columbia now allow for 
some level of marijuana use, and this 
Congress is going to have to catch up 
to what the States are doing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI). 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
him for his leadership in bringing this 
important legislation to the floor. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
in his outstanding 
State of the Union Address earlier this 
month, President Joe Biden presented 
Democrats’ visionary agenda to build a 
better America with lower healthcare 
costs for American families, and with 
justice in all that we do. 
House Democrats have long led the 
charge to lower the costs of prescrip-
tion drugs. So it is with great pride 
that the Democratic House today will 
advance one of the pillars of this vi-
sion: capping the cost of insulin at $35 
a month. In doing so, we take another 
important step in the fight to bring 
down drug prices across the board for 
every American family. 
I thank the lead sponsors of this leg-
islation who have been relentless, dis-
satisfied, and persistent in this fight: 
Congresswoman 
ANGIE
CRAIG, 
Con-
gressman DAN KILDEE, and Congress-
woman LUCY MCBATH of Georgia. 
I salute the chairs of the committees 
of jurisdiction for helping steer this 
vital legislation to the floor: Chairman 
FRANK PALLONE of the Committee on 
Energy 
and 
Commerce, 
Chairman 
RICHIE NEAL of the Committee on Ways 
and Means, and Chairman BOBBY SCOTT 
of the Committee on Education and 
Labor. 
Everyone knows that the cost of in-
sulin—a lifesaving drug that has been 
around for a century—is outrageous 
and out of control. That cost is out-
rageous and out of control. On average, 
Americans pay more than 10 times for 
insulin compared to what consumers 
around the world pay. Here in the 
United States the price of insulin sky-
rocketed by 54 percent from 2014 to 
2019. Meanwhile, Big Pharma is reaping 
record-breaking profits; producing in-
sulin at about $10 a vial, while charg-
ing families up to 30 times that 
amount. 
This affordability crisis is taking a 
severe human toll. One in four Ameri-
cans who rely on insulin have been 
forced to ration or skip their dose—a 
practice that can be dangerous and 
even deadly. And working parents with 
a family member on insulin are report-
ing higher levels of stress and anxiety 
and are often forced to choose between 
paying their bills and protecting the 
health of a loved one. 
Indeed, across the country, as I have 
said on this floor before, I have seen 
grown men cry about how they cannot 
meet their family’s needs when it 
comes to prescription drugs. This crisis 
is a kitchen-table issue for millions of 
families, and it is a medical, economic, 
and moral imperative that Congress 
take action. 
The Affordable Insulin Now Act not 
only requires Medicare and commercial 
users to cover lifesaving insulin on 
their plans, but also caps the out-of- 
pocket costs for families at $35 per 
month. In doing so, we put more money 
back in the pockets of hardworking 
families and vulnerable seniors. This is 
crucial right now, as so many Ameri-
cans struggle to keep up with the bur-
densome, everyday costs. Of course, 
this has even been exacerbated with 
COVID which has, in many instances, 
spread diabetes more. 
House Democrats proudly passed a 
cap on insulin’s cost in the Build Back 
Better legislation last year. We already 
did this last year. Today, we, again, 
take this strong step toward lower 
health costs for the people. To be clear, 
comprehensive 
reform 
is 
urgently 
needed to lift the crushing burden of 
prescription drug prices weighing on 
our families. 
Democrats will never ever relent, Mr. 
Speaker, until we realize our long-
standing goal of lowering drug prices 
across the board. And we are con-
tinuing our fight to empower Medicare 
to negotiate lower drug prices—we 
have been working on that for dec-
ades—and make these lower prices 
available to Americans with private in-
surance, too. 
We do so in honor of the late Chair-
man Elijah Cummings, the North Star 
in Congress and a relentless warrior for 
lower drug prices, with the Lower Drug 
Costs Now Act. 
Mr. Speaker, as you know, this rule 
applies not just to lowering the cost of 
insulin but also to the very important 
MORE Act. 
I also rise today in support of this ur-
gent legislation that will help pave the 
path toward racial and economic jus-
tice. 
I thank Chairman JERRY NADLER for 
his steadfast voice for equity and op-
portunity for all at the helm of the Ju-
diciary Committee. 
I 
salute 
Congressman 
ED
PERL-
MUTTER
for his tireless and long-
standing leadership on this issue, a re-
lentless persistence to satisfy, as the 
gentleman says. Thank heaven, we are 
passing it today. 
I also want to commend Congress-
woman BARBARA LEE and Congressman 
EARL BLUMENAUER for their persistence 
as well. 
For far too long, Mr. Speaker, failed 
Federal drug policies have torn apart 
families and devastated communities 
of color. People of color are four times 
more likely to be arrested on cannabis 
charges and are often targeted for 
longer prison terms than others. Trag-
ically, the communities most harmed 
by criminalization are benefiting the 
least from the legal cannabis market-
place as prior cannabis convictions are 
barring too many of them from enter-
ing the industry. As a result, only one- 
fifth of cannabis businesses are minor-
ity owned, and only 4 percent of owners 
are 
Black. 
Meanwhile, 
more 
than 
600,000 Americans are still arrested 
each year on cannabis charges, threat-
ening to perpetuate this vicious cycle. 
With the MORE Act, which the 
Democratic House proudly passed last 
Congress, we take strong actions to 
correct these injustices. 
This landmark legislation is one of 
the most important criminal justice 
reform bills in recent history: deliv-
ering justice for those harmed by the 
brutal and unfair consequences of crim-
inalization; opening the doors of oppor-
tunity for all to participate in this rap-
idly growing industry; and decrimi-
nalizing cannabis at the Federal level 
so we do not repeat the grave mistakes 
of our past. 
Those of us from California take 
pride in our State’s long leadership in 
this justice effort, and in recent years,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4031 
March 31, 2022 
46 more States have reformed cannabis 
laws. As the distinguished gentleman 
from Colorado mentioned in his re-
marks, 47 States have taken this act. 
Now it is time for the Federal Govern-
ment to follow suit. 
Both of the bills that the House will 
pass today that are covered by this 
rule, the insulin bill and the MORE 
Act, are overwhelmingly popular with 
the American people, and they rep-
resent strong steps toward building a 
brighter and fairer future for our chil-
dren. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge strong, bipar-
tisan ‘‘yes’’ votes on both bills and on 
the rule. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, as a law 
enforcement officer for over 23 years, I 
have had to make the devastating visit 
to unsuspecting family members to tell 
them that their loved one has died be-
cause a driver was driving under the in-
fluence. We can all sit here and pretend 
that marijuana is a harmless drug, but 
it is not. It clouds your judgment and 
inhibits your reaction time. 
The unfortunate reality is if we take 
steps to legalize marijuana, we will, 
without question, increase the number 
of people who will drive under the in-
fluence of marijuana on our roads. As 
we know all too well, there are many 
angel families in this country who have 
lost their sons and daughters to people 
who are unlawfully in this country and 
drove under the influence. 
My amendment would have ensured 
the MORE Act does not prohibit the 
deportation of illegal immigrants who 
are convicted of driving under the in-
fluence of marijuana. Unfortunately, 
Democrats blocked my commonsense 
and potentially lifesaving amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, shouldn’t we, at a min-
imum, ensure this legislation is not 
weaponized and used as a tool to get 
criminals who are in this country ille-
gally out of trouble and out of deporta-
tion proceedings? 
It seems to me that the safety of the 
American people continues to be a low 
priority for this Democrat majority. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask my friend from Minnesota if she 
has any other speakers. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. No, I do not, and I 
am prepared to close. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I continue to be dis-
appointed in the priorities of my col-
leagues. They have chosen to spend 
precious time that could be spent ad-
dressing the national debt, inflation, 
gas prices, or any number of serious 
issues facing Americans today. Instead, 
they chose to talk about legalizing 
marijuana and spending tax dollars on 
pot stores—which does not take into 
consideration important elements like 
how to protect minors or how to ad-
dress laws surrounding driving under 
the influence—and an insincere at-
tempt to address the rising cost of in-
sulin. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and 
the underlying bills, I ask Members to 
do the same, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, 
how much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado has 3 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the remainder of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
leagues for joining me here today to 
speak on the rule, the MORE Act, and 
the Affordable Insulin Now Act. I espe-
cially want to thank Mr. NADLER, Ms. 
LEE, and Mr. BLUMENAUER with respect 
to the MORE Act. 
Data is clear that patients in the 
United States pay more than 10 times 
for their insulin than what patients in 
other countries pay for this lifesaving 
drug. There are reports of people pay-
ing up to $1,000 a month just to keep 
themselves alive. Nobody should face 
these kinds of difficult decisions about 
affording their medication and keeping 
themselves healthy or putting food on 
the table. 
The Affordable Insulin Now Act puts 
a reasonable cap of $35 a month on this 
important drug, and I hope we can ad-
vance this bipartisan idea this week. 
b 1330 
On marijuana, we are long past due 
for the reforms in the MORE Act. The 
MORE Act is about justice, safety, eq-
uity, and States’ rights. We must de-
criminalize marijuana at the Federal 
level and take meaningful steps to ad-
dress the effects the war on drugs has 
had, particularly in minority and dis-
advantaged communities. 
To my friends on the other side of 
the aisle who claim this isn’t an impor-
tant issue to American families, I en-
courage them to talk to individuals 
who can’t pass a background check to 
get a job, visit with people who spent 
time in prison for a low-level mari-
juana conviction whose lives have been 
changed forever, talk to a State-legal 
business owner or employee who faces 
armed robberies or threats of violence 
due to all the cash they have since the 
business can’t access the banking sys-
tem. 
The House is acting again this week 
to urge the Senate to finally pass 
meaningful cannabis reform legisla-
tion. As this body knows, my SAFE 
Banking Act has passed the House six 
times now without any Senate action, 
with 
big 
bipartisan 
numbers. 
The 
House will pass the MORE Act this 
week. It is clear Congress needs to re-
form our broken cannabis laws to bet-
ter respond to the 37 States across the 
country that have some level of legal 
marijuana use. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1017 
At the end of the resolution, add the 
following: 
SEC. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
6858) to strengthen United States energy se-
curity, encourage domestic production of 
crude oil, petroleum products, and natural 
gas, and for other purposes. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
any amendment thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6858. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and 
the previous question. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time, and I move the previous 
question on the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays 
202, not voting 10, as follows:

AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 1017, I call 
up the bill (H.R. 6833) to amend title

quirements with respect to cost-shar-
ing for certain insulin products, and for 
other purposes, and ask for its imme-
diate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
PORTER). Pursuant to House Resolution 
1017, an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute consisting of the text of

read.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on H.R. 6833. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the Affordable Insu-
lin Now Act, which is critical to pro-
tecting more than 7 million American 
patients who rely on insulin. 
Today, one in four Americans who 
need insulin report either having cut 
back or skipped doses because the cost 
is simply too high. That is heart-
breaking and unacceptable. No one 
should have to ration their insulin to 
help reduce costs, risking their health 
and, in some tragic cases, actually 
costing them their lives. 
This bill will make insulin more af-
fordable by capping the out-of-pocket 
cost for consumers in both Medicare 
and the private insurance market at 
$35 a month. This will address the vast 
disparities between what people pay for 
insulin in other countries as compared 
to the United States. 
Right now, Americans are paying 
more than 10 times the price for insulin 
as people in other high-income coun-
tries. That is simply not fair. 
Right now, one out of every five 
Americans who depend on insulin have 
out-of-pocket costs of significantly 
more than $35 per month. That is un-
conscionable considering that insulin 
has been in use for over a century. 
I have heard my Republican col-
leagues contend that prices for insulin 
are coming down but, in reality, prices 
are going up for the consumer. The list 
prices set by the manufacturer, which 
patient cost-sharing is based off of, 
keep going up. In fact, reports note 
that the average retail price for insulin 
rose 54 percent—more than double— 
from 2014 to 2019. 
Now, Madam Speaker, I continue to 
strongly support comprehensive efforts 
to rein in the soaring costs of prescrip-
tion drugs and empowering Medicare to 
negotiate fair prices, but we cannot af-
ford to wait any longer to address the 
price of insulin. 
I commend Representatives CRAIG, 
KILDEE, and MCBATH for their leader-
ship and hard work in bringing this im-
portant legislation to the House floor. 
I urge my colleagues, on a bipartisan 
basis, to support this lifesaving legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
We all share the goal of reducing the 
cost of insulin. This bill, however, is 
not the right answer. This is an at-
tempt to revive Speaker PELOSI’s pro-
posed government drug-pricing scheme, 
part of a socialized medicine approach 
that would lead to fewer cures. 
It is the largest expansion of the Fed-
eral 
Government’s 
role 
in 
private 
health 
insurance 
design 
since 
ObamaCare. It will cost more than $11 
billion over the next 10 years through 
higher subsidies for higher premiums. 
Just this morning, Axios reported: 
‘‘But legislation like a House bill from 
Representative ANGIE CRAIG . . . that 
will be debated on the floor today 
wouldn’t address the core problem of 
rising prices for insulin. It would in-
stead shift more of the cost onto health 
insurers and employers and result in 
higher premiums, according to ex-
perts.’’ 
That means people who can’t afford 
day-to-day life because of inflation and 
spending will face higher costs some-
where else. 
Today, it is the government fixing 
the price on insulin. What is next? Gas? 
Food? 
History tells us that price-fixing 
doesn’t work. It shifts the problem 
somewhere else so the powerful have 
the excuse for more subsidies, more 
spending, and more control. 
This bill does nothing to address the 
real reasons insulin prices are going 
up. One of those is the pharmacy ben-
efit managers and other middlemen 
who negotiate for high list prices and 
then hide the lower costs from the pa-
tients. This bill gives the middlemen 
who are making the money a pass be-
cause again, in this bill, the Democrats 
delay the rebate rule that would ensure 
that the real savings go into the pock-
ets of the patients. 
Madam Speaker, we have a solution. 
We have a bill that we have been work-
ing on for several Congresses. It enjoys 
bipartisan support. It is H.R. 19, the 
Lower Costs, More Cures Act. 
It would lower the costs of all pre-
scription drugs, including insulin. It 
caps 
seniors’ 
out-of-pocket 
insulin 
costs at $50 per month through Medi-
care. It also allows high-deductible 
plans to cover insulin before the de-
ductible kicks in. It increases low-cost 
options with more generic and bio-
similar competition. There is exciting 
innovation on the way being built right 
now. And it creates more price trans-
parency. 
We should be lowering the costs with-
out going down the road of price con-
trols that destroy the hope of so many 
people in this country for lifesaving 
cures. 
I urge us to reject H.R. 6833. Let’s 
work on a solution for all diseases. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the majority 
leader, who, along with the rest of the 
leadership, continues this effort to ad-
dress affordability. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
First of all, this is not price control. 
It is limiting the purchaser on a price, 
but the companies are still going to 
charge what they are going to charge, 
and somebody is going to have to pay, 
and Medicare is going to have to pay. 
So, it does increase the cost. But it is 
not price control on the pharma-
ceuticals. And I want to say that we 
have a bill, of course, that will allow 
negotiation in Medicare, just as the VA 
does. 
b 1430 
Negotiation is not price control. Ne-
gotiation is saying, I am going to buy 
a lot of your product, and I want a bet-
ter price. 
A lot of us do that. We call it Sam’s 
Club, or some other club that we go to. 
And we buy large volumes and get a 
cheaper price than our poorer friends 
who just buy it one at a time. So I am 
for this bill. It is a good bill. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tives CRAIG, KILDEE, and MCBATH for 
their leadership on this bill. They have 
long 
been 
champions 
of 
making 
healthcare and prescription medica-
tions accessible and affordable for all 
Americans. 
More than one in three Americans 
are at high risk of developing diabetes, 
and over 37 million Americans already 
have it. A lot of those folks can’t do 
without insulin. They don’t have an op-
tion. And insulin has been on the mar-
ket for decades and is not protected 
under patent, and the development 
prices have ages ago been amortized. 
Madam Speaker, to treat their condi-
tion, the people who have diabetes 
must rely on insulin injections to regu-
late their blood sugar levels. Now, if 
you have no option of not buying a 
product, those who sell that product 
can put the price wherever, if it means 
your life. A lack of insulin can lead to 
insulin shock, diabetic coma, kidney 
failure, and death. 
It is unacceptable that this lifesaving 
medication is priced out of reach for 
many who need it because it costs so 
little to produce. 
This is not a mechanism that has to 
charge these prices because it took so 
much to produce it. It costs only $10 to 
manufacture a month’s supply. Yet, a 
month’s supply can cost hundreds of 
dollars. However, with out-of-pocket 
costs as high as over $600 for a 40-day 
supply—now, if you extrapolate 40 
days, that is 10 days more than a

month, so that is a third more. So let’s 
say it costs $13 to produce. $600. Why? 
Because if they don’t have it, they 
die. 
So all we are saying is, let’s make 
sure this is affordable so people can 
sustain their lives and their health. 
Many Americans have resorted to ra-
tioning by skipping doses of their insu-
lin because they can’t afford it. The 
legislation before us would cap the out- 
of-pocket price of insulin at $35 a 
month. 
Let me again remind you, that is 350 
percent of the cost of producing it. 
This would ease the burden of sky-
rocketing 
prices 
and 
impossible 
choices. 
Americans should not have to choose 
between paying the rent or for food, 
whatever, or paying for their insulin. 
As a matter of fact, they can’t make 
that choice. They need both. They need 
to eat, and they need to live. And insu-
lin is so often the way they assure that 
outcome. The prices will continue to 
rise unless we choose to act today. 
Madam Speaker, House Democrats 
already voted for this measure once, 
and Republicans already voted against 
it. So I guess we don’t have any sur-
prise of what’s going to happen here. 
The Republicans are going to say to 
those who are using insulin: You are on 
your own. You are on your own. We are 
not going to worry about it. 
And we are going to say: We are here 
to help. We are here to make sure you 
don’t get ripped off. We are here to 
make sure that you have the medicine 
that you absolutely need to survive. 
We voted for this measure as part of 
the Build Back Better Act in Novem-
ber. We made a promise to the Amer-
ican people that we would address the 
cost of prescription drugs, and we hon-
ored that promise. 
Republicans said no. They said once 
again: Consumer, you need insulin, you 
are on your own. They voted for higher 
drug prices. They voted for the status 
quo where many Americans have to 
choose between lifesaving insulin and 
putting food on the table. 
Today, my fellow colleagues, is an 
opportunity to vote to save lives and to 
provide a lifeline for millions of Ameri-
cans with diabetes. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, do 
not say to the American people: You 
are on your own. 
Tell them: We are here to help. Vote 
to help them. Vote to ensure that they 
will be able to afford a drug they need 
to protect themselves from death. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in voting to bring prices 
down across our economy and our 
healthcare system. Join me in pro-
tecting Americans’ ability to access 
lifesaving medication that prevents 
needless suffering, extends life, and 
provides a higher quality of living. 
Join me in voting for the Affordable 
Insulin for All Act. Again, I thank Ms. 
CRAIG, Mr. KILDEE, Mrs. MCBATH, the 
chairman of this committee, and all 
those who brought this bill to the 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues, don’t say, You are on your 
own. 
Say, We are by your side, and we are 
here to help. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I would just remind 
the body that the measure that the 
majority leader referred to failed in 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce with opposition from Democrats 
and Republicans because the proposed 
capping, price-fixing of drugs that the 
Democrats are promoting, would jeop-
ardize cures; cures for people with Alz-
heimer’s, cancers, diabetes. 
This bill does not bring down the 
cost. It only shifts the cost. And in 
fact, their definition of negotiation 
would allow the government to impose 
a 95 percent tax on the innovators. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE), leader 
on the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, Health Subcommittee. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to be here today. I worked with 
my colleague, DIANA DEGETTE. We had 
hearings on the cost of diabetes and on 
the supply chain, and we said this is 
something we can work on together. 
And we did work on it together. And 
most of those provisions are in a bipar-
tisan H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More 
Cures Act. 
Madam Speaker, I am fighting for my 
constituents to have lower insulin 
costs. But I think, more importantly, I 
am fighting for my constituents to de-
liver a cure for diabetes. Our experts 
say it is not impossible to have a cure 
for diabetes in the next decade. And we 
need to continue to push policies that 
promote innovation, not slow it down. 
So the Lower Costs, More Cures Act 
will help patients, including seniors, 
afford monthly insulin prescriptions 
without discouraging future invest-
ments in breakthrough medications. 
I encourage the majority to come 
back with H.R. 19, Lower Costs, More 
Cures Act, and let’s work together, in-
stead of the rhetoric that we just heard 
from our respected leader. Let’s work 
together and do it in a bipartisan way, 
the way we tried to do it in the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG), the prime 
sponsor of the bill, who is constantly 
working to address affordability issues 
for Americans. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Chairman PALLONE for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, diabetes does not 
care if you are a Republican or a Demo-
crat. This disease is an absolute tor-
rential disease inside working families 
across our country. This bill has been 
mischaracterized by the other side. 
This would lead to a $35 cost for Ameri-
cans, for Minnesotans, for part D Medi-
care beneficiaries and commercial plan 
beneficiaries. 
For the vast majority of working 
families, the price of insulin is simply 
unsustainable. Many Americans are 
forced to risk their own lives by ration-
ing doses or skipping treatments en-
tirely. Today, we have an opportunity 
to save American families thousands of 
their hard-earned dollars. 
Madam Speaker, my bill, the Afford-
able Insulin Now Act, would cap it at 
$35 a month. Certainly, our work to 
lower drug costs and expand access to 
healthcare across this Nation is not 
done. But this is a major step forward 
in the right direction and a chance to 
make good on our promises to the 
American people. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
BUCSHON), a great member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, we 
all share the same goal of lowering the 
cost of prescription drugs, especially 
insulin. But H.R. 6833 doesn’t get to the 
actual factors that drive the pricing. 
The bill before us today is just an-
other attempt by Democrats in Wash-
ington to pass a political solution and 
set Federal price controls. And once 
they open that door, what happens 
when they don’t stop with insulin? 
What happens when they decide to 
move on past healthcare, set price con-
trols on other sectors of our economy? 
Why not cap what you can sell your 
house for in order to get the cost of 
housing down? Congress can’t be for 
government price controls, as that is a 
slippery slope. 
Now, some of my colleagues may 
bring up the fact that Republicans’ bi-
partisan alternative, H.R. 19, also caps 
seniors’ out-of-pocket costs. But let me 
point out the distinction, it is Medi-
care part D. 
H.R. 6833 caps Medicare part D and 
private health plans. That is a direct, 
government price control on private 
companies. 
Madam Speaker, I am a doctor. I am 
also the co-chair of the House Kidney 
Caucus. I have an acute understanding 
of how expensive prescription drugs are 
and the need for Congress to act. How-
ever, I also understand that it is a 
structural issue and simply slapping 
price controls on it would not actually 
solve the problem. This will only raise 
premiums and shift the costs to pa-
tients with other diseases. 
Thankfully, there is a better way. 
H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures 
Act is a truly bipartisan solution to 
lower costs of all prescription drugs, 
including insulin. The bill caps out-of- 
pocket costs on prescription drugs in 
Medicare part D for seniors, allows 
high deductible health plans to cover 
insulin before the deductible kicks in, 
increases low-cost options by bringing 
more generic and biosimilar competi-
tion to the marketplace, and increases 
drug price transparency for patients. 
And the best part: Every provision is 
bipartisan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4037 
March 31, 2022 
So let’s get back to working together 
on bipartisan solutions that actually 
lower drug prices rather than resort to 
government price controls and a march 
towards government-run healthcare. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce 
to consider my amendment to H.R. 
6833, which is H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, 
More Cures Act of 2022. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the table of contents 
of this amendment in the RECORD im-
mediately prior to the vote on the mo-
tion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Indiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. ESHOO), chair of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, Subcommittee on Health. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in full support of this legislation. Seat-
ed here on the floor, listening to our 
Republican friends—price controls, so-
cialists, killing innovation. I am not 
going to use all of my time using their 
language. 
How about this? Diabetes kills. Dia-
betics need insulin. They have to be 
able to afford it. They have paid their 
taxes all of their lives, hardworking 
people. 
So the cost for this? Sign me up for 
it. Sign me up for it to help people, to 
invest in our own people. 
This is absurd, the prices in our 
country, when it costs $15 to manufac-
ture. 
So today, we stand with your con-
stituents as well as ours to lower the 
price of insulin for those that need it 
so that they can go on with their lives. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), the 
chair of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, 
Subcommittee 
on 
Con-
sumer Protection and Commerce. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, Americans pay 10 
times as much for insulin as do any 
other consumers in countries around 
the world. The exact same drug. You 
know, we actually have the names of 
people who have died because they 
could not afford their insulin and start-
ed to cut back on their prescribed 
amount. And that is just unacceptable. 
Big Pharma has been gouging con-
sumers for a long time, even for life-
saving drugs, and it is time to stop it. 
The Affordable Insulin Now Act will 
make insulin $35 a month for millions 
of Americans, and it will save life after 
life after life. This is only the start. We 
have to make sure that all Americans 
have access, including those who have 
no insurance. 
b 1445 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER), a member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Affordable 
Insulin Now Act. The bill before us 
today will finally deliver the financial 
relief Oregonians whose lives depend on 
insulin so desperately need. 
By capping the costs to no more than 
$35 month in Medicare part D and com-
mercial insurance, Congress is making 
it clear that no one should have to cut 
back, ration, or skip doses of lifesaving 
medication. 
I am proud that this policy is a cen-
tral tenet of my own drug pricing bill 
that I have worked on with leadership, 
secured in the House, and passed in the 
Build Back Better bill. We need to rein 
in all drug price prescriptions. That is 
why it is important to negotiate drug 
prices without stifling innovation, like 
we do in our bill. Limit the price in-
creases of everyday drugs to the price 
of inflation, and perhaps more impor-
tantly, limit out-of-pocket costs to 
seniors to $2,000 or less. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER), a member of 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Affordable In-
sulin Now Act, critical legislation to 
cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at 
$35 per month. 
I consistently hear from Granite 
State families about how the rising 
cost of insulin is forcing them to put 
their health at risk by cutting back on 
doses or skipping them all together be-
cause it is just too expensive. 
We cannot continue to force Amer-
ican families to make impossible deci-
sions between their medication and 
their well-being. At the end of the day, 
the work that we do is about our con-
stituents, and I can say right here, 
right now that I care more about the 
well-being of my constituents and their 
health than I do about the profits of 
certain companies that seem to be pro-
tected on the other side of the aisle. 
No one should pay more than $35 a 
month for their insulin, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
would inquire how much time is re-
maining on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 2 minutes 
remaining, and the gentlewoman from 
Washington has 31⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER), a 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted that today we will be voting 
to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act. 
This is personal for me. I have type 1 
diabetes and insulin keeps me alive. 
This tiny 2 teaspoon bottle that used to 
cost $40 now retails for over $300. Most 
of us need more than one bottle a 
month to survive. 
No one should have to ration their 
insulin—taking just enough to stay 
alive but not enough to stay healthy. 
That is a dangerous and sometimes 
deadly tightrope to walk, which is why 
this bill to cap insulin at $35 a month 
is so critical for my patients, as a pedi-
atrician, and for people like me. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CAR-
TER), an outstanding member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, for over 30 years I was the one 
who was on the other side of the 
counter who had to tell the patient 
how much their insulin costs. I was the 
one who watched the senior citizens 
trying to decide whether they were 
going to buy insulin or buy groceries. I 
was the one who watched a mother cry 
because she couldn’t afford the medica-
tion for her child. 
I was the one who watched all this 
happen, and now I am finally getting 
the opportunity to address this issue 
on the House floor. I am saddened that 
it will do nothing to protect those 
mothers from the pain of not being 
able to afford lifesaving medications. 
Make no mistake about this. We all 
agree on the same thing, Madam 
Speaker. We want lower prices for 
drugs, particularly for insulin. But in-
stead of fixing a broken system, this 
bill aims to control it. This Socialist 
plan of requiring every private insur-
ance company across the country to 
offer certain insulins, not all but cer-
tain, at a mandated price will have dis-
astrous consequences on seniors and 
the 217 million Americans who rely on 
private insurance. 
We all know that insurance agencies 
will shift these costs to patients with 
other diseases. Don’t kid yourself. This 
is like squeezing a balloon, it is going 
to go somewhere else. We aren’t talk-
ing about the bipartisan solutions that 
currently exist, like the Lower Costs, 
More Cures Act of 2021, H.R. 19. That is 
what we ought to be talking about. 
Why aren’t we talking about the 
PBMs, the middlemen? The Berkeley 
Institute came out with a study last 
week, Madam Speaker, that said that 
37 percent of the price of a drug goes to 
the pharmaceutical manufacturer and 
the rest goes to the middleman, the 
PBM. The solution is right there before 
us. This is not going to fix it. This is 
going to control it, but it is not going 
to fix it. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose this. We all 
have the same common goal, but this is 
not the solution.

H4038 
March 31, 2022 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Ms. BOURDEAUX). 
Ms. BORDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Affordable Insu-
lin Now Act. 
Before his death, my father paid $300 
for a 10 milliliter vial of insulin that 
cost about $25 in Canada. Far too many 
Americans, like my father, are forced 
to choose between paying for their 
medication or buying food for their 
families. No one should have to make 
that choice. 
Georgia has one of the highest diabe-
tes rates in the country, and this meas-
ure would provide my constituents 
with meaningful relief. I urge all of my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6833 
and lower the cost of insulin. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the balance of my time to the 
gentleman of New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE). 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank the chairman for giving 
me this opportunity because I wanted 
my colleagues on the other side to see 
what an insulin patient looks like. You 
are looking at him. 
I need insulin in order to stay alive. 
The boot that I am wearing is not a 
fashion decision, it is because I have a 
diabetic ulcer on my foot, the fourth 
one I have had in 7 years. 
I have left my insulin in New Jersey, 
gone to the drugstore when I arrived 
down here in Washington, and said: I 
need insulin. They said: Well, Mr. 
PAYNE, your insurance isn’t ready to 
cover it. I said: Well, that is all right. 
I am doing okay in life, I will pay for 
it. She goes back, she gets the bag and 
hands it to me and says: $348. What 
happens to the people that are not at 
the level of a Member of Congress? 
Think about that. It is $12 in Canada. 
We are asking for it to be three times 
higher than it is in Canada. Think 
about that. I live it every single day. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I hear the Demo-
crats talking about this helping all 
Americans. This does nothing to help 
those without insurance. Let me repeat 
this. If you do not have insurance, this 
does not lower your cost, it may actu-
ally increase the price of your insulin. 
Increasing 
competition 
to 
lower 
prices, as we do in H.R. 19 is the way, 
not dictating a price cap. We have 
break-through biosimilars right now. 
We 
had 
two 
approved 
last 
year; 
biosimilars that would help bring down 
the costs; costs savings within all mar-
kets so that patients would have access 
to lower-cost insulin. 
The problem is getting those savings 
to the patients. The PBMs are the ones 
pocketing the money. Net prices have 
come down because of innovation. We 
can lower costs without shifting them. 
Let’s go to work. Republicans and 
Democrats, we all want to lower the 
price of insulin and we can do it with-
out government price controls and we 
can do it by working together and ac-
tually solving the problem. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE) 
and the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairman NEAL for his leadership on 
the Ways and Means Committee in 
helping to bring this important legisla-
tion to the floor. 
Right now, families and seniors that 
I represent in Michigan, and all across 
the country, are paying too much for 
prescription drugs, in particular, for 
insulin. That is why Congresswoman 
CRAIG and Congresswoman MCBATH and 
I have introduced the Affordable Insu-
lin Now Act to make insulin more ac-
cessible and more affordable. 
This legislation would lower out-of- 
pocket costs for Americans with diabe-
tes by ensuring that insurers and Medi-
care can’t charge more than $35 a 
month out-of-pocket for this medica-
tion. 
Insulin was discovered over 100 years 
ago. Since then, little about this life-
saving medication has changed, but the 
price of insulin in the United States 
has absolutely skyrocketed. As a re-
sult, Americans pay 10 times more for 
insulin than patients in other devel-
oped countries, and one in four Ameri-
cans who rely on insulin have cut back 
or skipped their doses due to costs. 
No one should have to choose be-
tween taking their medication as pre-
scribed and putting food on the table or 
a roof over their head. People must 
make that choice because of Big 
Pharma’s unfair pricing practices. This 
is something I know a little bit about. 
As a father of a type 1 diabetic, I 
have seen firsthand how the high price 
of prescription drugs like insulin can 
harm patients and harm families. When 
my daughter turned 26 and got her own 
health insurance, there are months 
where she spends a third of her take- 
home pay, because she is diabetic, on 
staying alive. She has her mom and I 
to back her, but not everybody has 
that advantage. Either way, it doesn’t 
make it okay. 
In Michigan, it is estimated that 1 in 
10 people have some form of diabetes. 
The average sticker price for a month’s 
supply of insulin is $375, but for some it 
can be as high as $1,000 a month, just 
because they need to take more insu-
lin. That is just not right. 
Jill Verdier, a type 1 diabetic from 
my district, was my virtual guest at 
the State of the Union this year. She 
told me that insulin is like air to peo-
ple with diabetes, they need it to 
survive. 
b 1500 
At a time when Big Pharma is mak-
ing record profits, Congress has to do 
more to lower costs, out-of-pocket 
costs. And that is why I fought to bring 
this bill to the floor with my col-
leagues, Representative CRAIG and Rep-
resentative MCBATH. I urge my col-
leagues to vote to pass our legislation 
to lower costs. This is important legis-
lation. I know we need to invest in 
cures. Obviously we would like to see 
the total price of insulin come down. 
But it is difficult to hear my colleagues 
on the other side who oppose the legis-
lation to bring down the cost will also 
oppose this legislation to keep Ameri-
cans from having to spend more out of 
their pocket. I think this is legislation 
that makes sense. It would help people. 
It would save lives. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this issue is so im-
portant I don’t think we should auto-
matically accept a partisan proposal 
that doesn’t even get to the heart of 
the problem. 
Today we actually could be voting on 
H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures 
Act, a bipartisan bill that would not 
only address the root causes of the 
high insulin prices, but lower costs for 
all patients. 
Instead, and I might say, very sadly, 
we are voting on a partisan messaging 
bill to give Washington a greater say in 
Americans’ medical decisions while 
raising premiums on seniors and the 
millions of Americans with private 
health insurance. 
This is nothing more than an at-
tempt by my colleagues on the other 
side to pass just piece by piece their 
cures-killing Socialist takeover of the 
entire innovation sector. And worse, 
despite the misleading title of this cur-
rent bill, it does nothing to lower the 
actual price of insulin. Instead, it uses 
budget games and regulations to dis-
guise the actual cost of insulin for all 
consumers. 
This is just another instance of mis-
guided health and economic policies 
coming at a time when more than half 
of Americans are worried about rising 
prices and the economy. And, of course, 
like the President’s budget released 
this week, this bill, too, is only ‘‘paid 
for’’ with gimmicks, adding to our def-
icit and the core causes of inflation. 
We can and should do more for the 
American people who are struggling. 
The American people expect us to work 
together. We could be doing that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), who is my 
colleague on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee.

know firsthand the high cost of this 
prescription. There is nothing in my 
district more prevalent as a disease en-
tity than diabetes. I strongly support 
it. It is an idea whose time not only 
has come but has passed. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT), who is also a member of 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, to 
assure a stable supply of insulin and 
better health at $35 instead of $300 
monthly, I fully support this bill for 
Yolanda, a retired Texas teacher, and 
one-quarter of insulin-dependent pa-
tients forced to ration their insulin be-
cause of predatory pricing. 
Yet, instead of addressing pharma-
ceutical price gouging, this bill really 
only shifts how Big Pharma is re-
warded. Since this bill does not reduce 
any insulin prices by one penny, all of 
us who are insured will ultimately pay 
through our premiums while taxpayers 
are on the hook for $11 billion. For 
Americans who rely on other types of 
lifesaving drugs, there is also no relief. 
Big Pharma remains immune from any 
restraint on its monopoly prices from a 
Congress that is simply unable to hold 
it accountable. 
My further concern is that this bill 
widens the coverage gap for nearly 5.5 
million Texans and 28 million Ameri-
cans who are uninsured, wrongly ex-
cluded from any benefit, and who do 
not receive any benefit today. While 
the uninsured population represents 17 
percent of the insulin-dependent popu-
lation, they constitute 80 percent of 
the people who pay full, monopoly 
prices. So, help for some—which is im-
portant—but there is a need to do more 
for the many who are not covered 
today. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD let-
ters 
from

rep-
resenting and reflecting the views of 
millions of Americans. 
AMAC ACTION, 
Leesburg, FL, March 30, 2022. 
Hon. STEVE SCALISE, 
House Republican Whip, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR WHIP SCALISE: On behalf of the 2.3 
million members of AMAC—Association of 
Mature American Citizens, I write to express 
our concern with H.R. 6833, the Affordable 
Insulin Now Act. 
Not too long ago, former President Trump 
made significant gains in lowering insulin 
costs for Americans. He initiated the Part D 
Senior Savings Model a voluntary program 
which allows beneficiaries to choose en-
hanced Part D plan options that offer lower 
out-of-pocket costs for insulin. He also 
signed an Executive Order that delivered in-
expensive insulin and epinephrine to lower 
income patients. Unfortunately, President 
Biden delayed this Executive Order the day 
after he took office in 2021 before rescinding 
it later that year. 
Now, the Democrats are considering H.R. 
6833 which is an unserious attempt to lower 
the price of insulin. This bill would exert 
price controls on private market insulin to 
cap the costs paid by patients. H.R. 6833 
takes us closer to further pharmaceutical 
price-fixing, a policy contained the Build 
Back Better plan. Price-fixing drugs leads to 
rationing and shortages as evidenced in 
other countries who have employed this pol-
icy. The Democrats’ bill is estimated to in-
crease spending by about $11 billion, and the 
bill is paid for by delaying the rebate rule for 
one year. This Trump-era rule compels phar-
macy benefit managers to share the rebates 
they receive from drug manufacturers with 
Part D beneficiaries to lower their out-of- 
pocket expenses. 
The Affordable Insulin Now Act is an elec-
tion year messaging act on the part of Demo-
crats. If they were serious about lowering 
the cost of insulin, they would work with Re-
publicans on innovative programs like the 
Part D Senior Savings Model, a program 
that is expanding with robust participation 
by plan sponsors and offers predictable insu-
lin costs that do not exceed $35/month. 
As an organization comprised of Americans 
who are age 55-plus, controlling drug costs, 
especially insulin costs, is paramount to 
maintaining a good quality of life for AMAC 
members. H.R. 6833 is a step in the wrong di-
rection for lowering insulin prices and opens 
the door for further government price-fixing 
and regulation. 
Sincerely, 
BOB CARLSTROM, 
President, AMAC Action, 
COUNCIL FOR CITIZENS 
AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE, 
March 30, 2022, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: You will soon be 
considering H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin 
Now Act. On behalf of the more than one 
million members and supporters of the Coun-
cil for Citizens Against Government Waste 
(CCAGW), I urge you to oppose H.R. 6833 and 
any other measure to institute price controls 
in the medical marketplace. 
In addition to imposing price controls, 
H.R. 6833 also increases funding for the Medi-
care Improvement Fund by $9 billion and 
adds $1.5 million to the budget for the Cen-
ters for Medicare and Medicaid Services to 
carry out the provisions of the bill. 
Historically, price controls like those con-
tained in the Affordable Insulin Now Act in-
crease costs and lead to shortages and ra-
tioning. H.R. 6833 will lead to increased pre-
miums for seniors and the 217 million Ameri-
cans who rely on private health insurance. 
The government has no business setting 
prices on any good or service, especially not 
healthcare. Price controls inherently distort 
the medical marketplace and leave Ameri-
cans worse off by significantly decreasing fu-
ture research and development. 
Americans are already suffering under the 
highest inflation in 40 years, and H.R. 6833 
will increase this financial hardship. The 
cost of medicines should be address without 
instituting price controls or threatening fu-
ture innovation. I again urge you to oppose 
this legislation. All votes on H.R. 6833 may 
be among those considered in CCAGW’s 2022 
Congressional Ratings. 
Sincerely, 
TOM SCHATZ. 
NFIB, 
Washington, DC, March 30, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: On behalf of NFIB, the nation’s leading 
small business advocacy organization, I 
write to express concern regarding H.R. 6833, 
the Affordable Insulin Now Act. 
This legislation has a laudable goal of at-
tempting to make insulin more affordable 
and accessible to Americans on private and 
public health plans. Unfortunately, it will 
have unintended consequences for small 
businesses and employees by necessitating 
increased premiums while failing to address 
the underlying issues that make insulin 
unaffordable in the first place. 
As studies have shown, a limited number of 
manufacturers, patent evergreening, prac-
tices of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), 
and other issues contribute to the high price 
of insulin. H.R. 6833 does not address any of 
these problems and instead seeks to solve 
consumer affordability by pushing signifi-
cant, additional costs onto employers and 
health plans by limiting participant cost 
sharing. 
For over 30 years, NFIB members have 
identified the cost of health insurance as the 
number one small business problem with 50 
percent ranking it as a critical problem. Ris-
ing health insurance premiums result in 
fewer small businesses offering health insur-
ance benefits. Since 2000, the average costs of 
an employer-sponsored single coverage plan 
and an employer-sponsored family plan have 
increased 149 percent and 18 percent, respec-
tively. Unsurprisingly, facing these cost 
pressures, the number of small businesses 
with fewer than 50 employees offering cov-
erage has declined from 47.2 percent in 2000 
to 31 percent in 2020. Many small employers 
that are providing insurance have been 
forced to increase participant cost-sharing 
and deductibles as the only means to counter 
unsustainable premium increases and con-
tinue to offer coverage. To that end, solu-
tions to affordability that limit cost-sharing 
without corresponding reforms will only 
serve to increase premiums and further exac-
erbate the small business affordability prob-
lem. 
NFIB continues to advocate for affordable 
health insurance for small businesses and all 
Americans. However, if the system of em-
ployer sponsored health insurance is to en-
dure in the long-term, Congress must work 
together to address the underlying cost driv-
ers of the American healthcare system, rath-
er than shift additional cost burdens onto 
employers seeking to offer health insurance 
to their employees. 
Sincerely, 
KEVIN KUHLMAN, 
Vice President, 
Federal Government Relations.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-

strong concerns regarding H.R. 6833 the ‘‘Af-

shares the goal of lowering the cost of insu-

costs back to employers and employees, in-
cluding those who are insulin dependent. A 
better and more direct solution that address-
es excessive profit taking by pharmaceutical 
manufacturers and others, including phar-
macy benefit managers, in the pharma-
ceutical supply chain would be preferable. 
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) re-
cently found that H.R. 6833 would increase 
the federal deficit by as much as $11 billion

premiums for all Americans. Indeed, there 
will not be any curb on future insulin price 
increases paid by employers and insurers. 
Every dollar of cost increase will be reflected 
in ever higher health insurance premiums 
paid by all Americans, whether privately in-
sured or covered through Medicare. Better 
approaches that increase competition among 
insulin manufacturers, address regulatory 
problems and streamline the supply chain 
will help reduce the cost of all prescription

THE ERISA INDUSTRY COMMITTEE, 
Washington, DC, March 29, 2022. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: As the House 
prepares to vote on the ‘‘Affordable Insulin 
Now Act’’ (H.R. 6833), The ERISA Industry 
Committee (ERIC) writes to share opposition 
to this legislation and urges members to 
vote ‘‘NO’’ when the bill is called for a vote. 
ERIC is a national nonprofit organization 
exclusively representing the largest employ-
ers in the United States in their capacity as 
sponsors of employee benefit plans for their 
nationwide workforces. With member compa-
nies that are leaders in every economic sec-
tor, ERIC is the voice of large employer plan 
sponsors on federal, state, and local public 
policies impacting their ability to sponsor 
benefit plans and to lawfully operate under 
ERISA’s protection from a patchwork of dif-
ferent and conflicting state and local laws, 
in addition to federal law. 
ERIC member companies voluntarily offer 
comprehensive health benefits to millions of 
active and retired workers and their families 
across the country. Our members offer great 
health benefits to attract and retain employ-
ees, be competitive for human capital, and 
improve health and provide peace of mind. 
On average, large employers pay around 75 
percent of health care costs on behalf of 181 
million beneficiaries. As such, ERIC member 
companies have a significant stake in, and 
deep 
commitment 
to, 
efforts 
to 
curb 
unsustainable rising costs in the health care 
system. 
Employers oppose H.R. 6833 because the 
bill imposes government-mandated prices, 
shifts costs to patients, and will not lower 
drug costs. The bill may in fact increase the 
costs of insulin by creating a perverse incen-
tive wherein insulin manufacturers know 
that no matter how much they increase 
prices, their customers will pay government- 
set prices. This action will cause employers, 
insurers, and other health insurance enroll-
ees to pay more to offset these high costs. 
This view is supported by the Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO), which recently found 
that this policy would increase the federal 
deficit by around $11 billion and increase 
health insurance premiums for all Ameri-
cans. 
ERIC and our member companies support 
legislation that would actually lower pre-
scription drug costs, including for insulin, 
rather than shift costs to employers and 
other patients. Congress could achieve this 
by enacting policies to: 
Increase competition among insulin manu-
facturers; 
Fix 
the 
regulatory 
problems 
that 
misclassify insulin and fail to properly align 
market exclusivity and patent protections to 
the drug; and 
Address supply chain issues like rebates 
and bona fide service fees that lead to 
formularies that do not reflect value for pa-
tients. 
Many of these proposals are already in-
cluded in bipartisan legislation that could be 
quickly passed and sent to the President for 
his signature. They have been scored by CBO 
to lower drug costs and health insurance pre-
miums for all Americans. 
Because the ‘‘Affordable Insulin Now Act’’ 
fails to reduce drug prices and raises health 
insurance costs for all, ERIC urges members 
to vote NO, and oppose the passage of H.R. 
6833. We look forward to working with Con-
gress on productive, effective, value-driven 
solutions to make prescription drugs—in-
cluding insulin—affordable for all Ameri-
cans. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. GELFAND. 
FREEDOMWORKS, 
March 30, 2022. 
KEY VOTE NO ON THE AFFORDABLE INSULIN 
NOW ACT, H.R. 6833 
On behalf of FreedomWorks’ activist com-
munity, I urge you to contact your rep-
resentative and ask him or her to vote NO on 
the Affordable Insulin Now Act, H.R. 6833, in-
troduced by Rep. Angie Craig (D–Minn.). 
This legislation would impose socialist price 
controls to cap the price of insulin at $35. 
Currently, Americans are grappling with 
the harsh reality of increased prices on ev-
erything from gas to groceries. We see first-
hand the consequences of modem monetary 
theory and the devastation it brings. Unfor-
tunately, the many Americans that struggle 
with diabetes are no stranger to increased 
prices. The cost of insulin has been steadily 
rising for decades. 
While progressives are all too eager to 
blame high prices on ‘‘corporate greed,’’ the 
reality is that this is an issue created by the 
federal government. Heavy-handed price con-
trols are a deeply flawed solution that 
misses the mark when identifying the prob-
lem. 
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) play a 
significant role in the dramatic rise in the 
cost of prescription drugs. PBMs are third- 
party 
administrators 
determining 
which 
drugs go on formularies (a list of approved 
prescription drugs that hospitals can pre-
scribe and are covered under an insurance 
policy). Ostensibly, PBMs negotiate to ob-
tain the best price. However, these ‘‘savings’’ 
are often pocketed by PBMs themselves and 
aren’t passed onto patients. Since they are 
reimbursed based on the markdown from the 
original list price, PBMs are incentivized to 
prioritize drugs with higher list prices, so 
they can receive a larger markdown. 
There are free-market alternatives to 
lower the cost of insulin and healthcare in 
general. For example, it was reported in an 
article in The Federalist, ‘‘A consortium of 
hospitals recently announced plans to build 
a factory that can manufacture insulin with-
in two years. Once their plant gets up and 
running, the non-profit consortium said it 
would sell the insulin at a cost of $30 a vial— 
a fraction of what pharmaceutical companies 
currently charge.’’ 
This legislation is a simplistic proposal to 
address a highly complex problem. We can-
not afford half-hearted proposals based on 
unsound economics like this one for an issue 
that impacts so many. 
FreedomWorks will count the vote for H.R. 
6833 on our 2022 Congressional Scorecard and 
reserves the right to score any amendments, 
motions, or other related votes. The score-
card is used to determine eligibility for the 
FreedomFighter Award, which recognizes 
Members of the House and Senate who con-
sistently vote to support economic freedom 
and individual liberty. 
Sincerely,

President, FreedomWorks. 
NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION 
As the calendar turns to April, the U.S. 
House of Representatives is planning to vote 
on legislation that would cap insulin costs 
for all Americans who are privately insured 
or on Medicare Part D at no more than $35 
per month in out-of-pocket payments. While 
the bill’s sponsors may have good intentions, 
and while Congress can certainly act to pro-
vide support for Americans facing high pre-
scription drug costs, NTU has several con-
cerns about the impact the ‘‘Affordable Insu-
lin Now Act’’ will have on America’s tax-
payers and broader health care system. 
The legislation would impose new cost- 
sharing limits on insulin for almost all pri-
vately insured Americans, and would extend 
these limitations to the tens of millions of 
Americans on Medicare Part D. According to 
a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost es-
timate, the bill’s requirements would cost 
federal taxpayers around $11 billion ($6.6 bil-
lion in higher spending and $4.8 billion in re-
duced revenues). It is likely this cost esti-
mate is due to anticipated higher premiums 
in both Medicare Part D and the Affordable 
Care Act individual marketplace. In these 
programs, higher premiums usually mean 
higher federal subsidies for health coverage 
that are paid for by taxpayers. 
Indeed, proponents of the legislation have 
not properly addressed the impact this legis-
lation would have on premiums in both Part 
D and the private marketplace. The Afford-
able Insulin Now Act puts a cap on the out- 
of-pocket costs owed by insured enrollees for 
insulin products, but it does not ultimately 
change the price of insulin paid for by health 
insurers. If insurers face higher costs for cov-
ering these drugs, they will likely be forced 
to pass those costs on to customers in the 
form of higher premiums or higher cost-shar-
ing on other health products and services. 
And, as noted above, some higher premiums 
will result in higher costs for taxpayers, who 
bear some of the burden for covering seniors 
under Part D and low- and middle-income 
Americans on the ACA marketplace. 
Perhaps the most troubling part of the leg-
islation, though, is the proposed offset for 
the cost of the legislation. House Democratic 
leadership is proposing to ‘pay for’ the legis-
lation’s $11 billion cost with a shameless 
budget gimmick that NTU and NTU Founda-
tion have called out before: delaying a 
Trump administration ‘‘rebate’’ regulation 
that was projected to raise federal govern-
ment costs but was never likely to be imple-
mented in the first place. 
As NTU wrote in July of last year, when a 
bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed 
using rebate rule delay as a pay-for in the 
major infrastructure bill: 
‘‘This phantom $49 billion ‘‘pay for’’ was 
called ‘‘Washington at its worst’’ by one 
health industry lobbyist speaking to The 
Washington Post. In short, the Biden admin-
istration has delayed until 2023 a Trump ad-
ministration regulation that would change 
how prescription drug discounts are handled 
by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers 
(PBMs). Because the Congressional Budget 
Office projected that the so-called rebate 
rule would increase federal spending in Medi-
care and Medicaid by about $177 billion over

a decade, due to a rise in Medicare premiums 
(and therefore, taxpayer-funded subsidies for 
Medicare 
premiums), 
lawmakers 
get 
to 
count a further delay in the rule (beyond the 
Biden administration’s one-year delay) as 
‘‘savings’’ for the federal government. Re-
ports indicate Congressional Democrats may 
use additional phantom ‘‘savings’’ from the 
rebate rule in their larger reconciliation bill 
by repealing the rebate rule entirely. 
. . . This rule has never been implemented, 
and there’s no clear indication that the 
Biden administration would have followed 
through on implementing the regulation 
even after their one-year delay. And even if 
the Biden administration had implemented 
the rule, there’s little clarity as to whether 
the rebate rule would have actually cost fed-
eral taxpayers over $177 billion over the dec-
ade. In short, delaying the rebate rule does 
not present real, tangible savings to tax-
payers, like a reduction in federal spending 
would.’’ 
Unfortunately, it seems like the rebate 
rule is becoming yet another tried-and-true 
budget gimmick that Congress dips into 
again and again, in order to appear as if they 
are paying for new spending. And according 
to the CBO estimate cited above, because the 
rebate rule is projected to offer $20 billion in 
phantom savings—not just the $11 billion 
needed to cover the insulin bill’s costs—the 
revised insulin legislation proposes spending 
another $9 billion on a broad-based Medicare 
Improvement Fund. That means $9 billion 
more will ultimately be spent without real 
offsets and, in our view, be paid for by tax-
payers in the long run with higher debt and 
deficits. 
To be clear, high out-of-pocket costs for in-
sulin are a real issue for many Americans. 
NTU continues to support several bipartisan 
and meaningful proposals that would provide 
relief for many Americans, including: 
An out-of-pocket cap in Medicare Part D, 
along with Part D benefit redesign that 
would actually save taxpayers money in the 
long run; 
An ongoing Medicare insulin model that 
represents a public-private partnership be-
tween the federal government, insurers, and 
drug manufacturers that has the potential to 
meaningfully reduce out-of-pocket insulin 
costs for up to millions of seniors on Part D; 
and 
Allowing Part D enrollees to spread their 
out-of-pocket burdens over the 12 months of 
a plan year, rather than having to owe major 
bills in the first or second months of a new 
plan year. 
This legislation could undermine the ongo-
ing Medicare insulin model, Part D redesign 
efforts, and reported bipartisan work in the 
Senate to provide insulin cost relief for 
American patients who are struggling. The 
House should go back to the drawing board 
and focus on more bipartisan opportunities. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT), who is an ex-
pert in health policy. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
you do realize what is going on here, 
and I am going to be a little sarcastic 
because I am frustrated. 
Insulin prices are outrageous. 
But why is it outrageous? 
The fact of the matter is our regu-
latory mechanic and our payment me-
chanic are the very things that broke 
this, and here you do a piece of legisla-
tion that will break it more. 
Please, I beg of the majority: Hire an 
economist. 
And 
I 
will 
walk 
you 
through some of the facts on it. So, 
Madam Speaker, you are doing a bill 
here where you are going to subsidize 
the dollar amount in the back, but you 
are still going to keep the regulatory 
mechanics the way they are in their ar-
chaic designs, and then you are going 
to be joyful that individuals will pay 
what, $35 a vial? 
At the same time we are subsidizing 
it billions and billions and billions of 
dollars. 
Does anyone have a subscription to 
an aggregator on healthcare policy on 
your side? 
You do realize, there is a co-op com-
ing out of the ground right now that is 
going to be $50, $55 for a box of five. It 
is lower than your subsidized price. 
And this is their market price. 
If you were doing something good for 
society, you would actually be moving 
this covax to the top of the regulatory 
stack and say: We want them to get 
permitted and licensed as fast as pos-
sible because they are still a year plus 
away. But it is being built right now, 
and you are about to screw up the solu-
tion. And if you really, really, really, 
really care about people—remember, I 
represent the population with the sec-
ond highest number of diabetes. I rep-
resent a Tribal community that is 
number two in the world. Come with 
me some time and let me introduce you 
to people who have had their feet cut 
off. If you actually care about solving 
the misery, then read the science jour-
nals that made it clear last November, 
December, the success. 
We know how to cure. And for my 
friend over here, you have a family 
member type 1—I know I need to go 
through the Speaker—but a family 
member with type 1, we know how to 
cure it now. And there is even the next 
generation of this. We have even 
learned how to do the stem cell, the 
isolate cell, tag it with a CRISPR so 
you can do a bio-foundry, meaning it 
doesn’t have to come from your skin 
cells, we can basically now cure type 1 
and the same technology will work for 
type 2. But we are going to have to deal 
with some societal issues. If you want 
to end the misery in society don’t build 
more clinics, don’t do a subsidy, get 
this technology to people. 
And for those of us who are fiscal 
hawks and actually care about where 
we are going, you do realize that 31 
percent of all Medicare spending is just 
diabetes. Thirty-three percent of all 
healthcare spending is diabetes. And so 
the brain trust here decides: Hey, let’s 
subsidize this by billions and billions 
and billions and billions and billions of 
dollars, screw up the movement to ac-
tually have cures to actually have a co- 
op provide the product dramatically 
less expensive. 
Remember, the co-op is going to 
bring it in cheaper than the subsidized 
price without all the taxpayer money. 
Please, I know the virtue signaling 
here is powerful. The economics are 
crap. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is reminded to direct his re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, to my 
friend from Arizona, I appreciate his 
passion. I wish it were true that he had 
somehow cured diabetes. It would be 
great news for my daughter and so 
many other Americans who say that 
they are looking for that cure. In the 
meantime, while we are working to get 
there—and I appreciate the effort, I do, 
because I am on board, I am completely 
on board with the notion that we ought 
to cure this terrible disease—however, 
until that day comes, let’s make sure 
that the people who depend on insulin 
in order to stay alive can live to see 
that day that I know he and I both are 
looking forward to. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PASCRELL), who is my colleague from 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, the 
Affordable Insulin Now Act will cap 
out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 a 
month—not a miracle by any stretch of 
the imagination. And anyone who sup-
ports legislation in this order and oth-
ers where we address other diseases ob-
viously, we are working on new situa-
tions just about every month. So be-
cause you are working on it and you 
are trying to find a balance of the free 
market, and where the price goes with-
out fixing the price of what something 
will cost, I mean, we have been called 
worse things than Socialists. When you 
come to this debate, I’ll settle on that 
word. 
Well, what does that mean? 
You want to get into a debate about 
socialism? 
I served in the Armed Forces. I 
fought for my country. I am tired of 
being called names. 
Seven million Americans who use in-
sulin want to stay alive. The average 
insulin costs rose 54 percent. We have 
heard that before. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, 
when insulin was discovered, Warren 
Harding was the President and the New 
York Giants won the World Series, yet 
there was no television to watch the 
New York Giants. 
Insulin costs are a national disgrace. 
For a drug discovered over 100 years 
ago, $1,000 price tag for a single vial is 
an outrage. You know it, and I know it. 
So get beyond the argument that we 
are all a bunch of Socialists because we 
want to help people. We are doing what 
the folks sent us here to do. We can’t 
do it on every drug. We need the tech-
nology. The gentleman from Arizona is 
right on target. It will save lives. 
If we can’t do that, then what the 
heck are we doing here? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is reminded to direct his re-
marks to the Chair.

H4042 
March 31, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, it is interesting listening to 
the debate here. Certainly my col-
league, Mr. DOGGETT, I think very ap-
propriately pointed out: 
This bill does not lower the price of insulin 
by one penny. It just simply shifts around 
who pays for what. 
We 
have 
seen 
that 
pattern 
in 
healthcare across America for some 
time now, and I would hope that we 
could learn from that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. CHU), who is a member 
of the Ways and Means Committee. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 6833, 
the Affordable Insulin Now Act. 
I will never forget the day a con-
stituent in my district showed me his 
bottle of insulin. He told me that one 
day while traveling in Canada he found 
he forgot it, so he went to a pharmacy. 
He found that that same bottle of insu-
lin that he buys here in the U.S. for 
$200 cost only $25 in Canada, the exact 
same product. 
He started calculating how much it 
would cost him to fly to Canada once 
every 3 months, and then asked him-
self: Why are Americans the only ones 
paying these exorbitant prices? 
Nobody should have to sacrifice just 
to afford medicine. That is why today’s 
bill is so important. By capping the 
cost of insulin at $35 a month, this bill 
will ensure that monthly costs for mil-
lions of families are truly affordable. It 
is time to prioritize the needs of our 
people so that every American can af-
ford to stay alive. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
Madam Speaker, I think that this 
discussion that we are having here 
today is important. I also believe that 
we need to work together on solutions 
to actually reduce the cost of insulin, 
again, not just shifting around who 
pays for what. But certainly I am will-
ing to give my colleague on the other 
side more information about the infor-
mation Mr. SCHWEIKERT was sharing. 
He is very knowledgeable on the sub-
ject. He certainly works with his con-
stituents a lot, constituents in need. 
And we know that literally millions of 
people across America are in need for 
lower-cost insulin. We owe them, I 
think, a much better approach than 
just simple government intrusion and 
more government involvement shifting 
around the cost. 
b 1515 
I was a bit alarmed earlier when I 
heard that we should maybe make 
Medicare prescription coverage more 
like the VA. We need to remember that 
the VA offers roughly 50 percent of the 
options for participants compared to 
Medicare. I don’t think we want to re-
duce the choices that seniors would 
have with their formularies within 
Medicare part D. If anything, we 
should make sure they have more 
choices. We know that more choices in 
the marketplace bring down the price, 
and we need to focus in that direction. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this bill. We owe the American peo-
ple a diligent effort, working together 
to truly reduce the cost of insulin. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my col-
leagues’ support of this legislation. 
This is important legislation. 
I will say this: I understand the 
points that have been made on the 
other side. As a father of a type 1 dia-
betic, I am one of those many millions 
of families that pay very close atten-
tion to the important research that we 
think ultimately may lead to a cure for 
diabetes, so I embrace the suggestion 
made on the other side that we have 
hope for a cure. I have hope for a cure. 
Ever since my daughter was diagnosed, 
I have been waiting for that moment, 
as she has, for that cure to appear. If it 
is just outside our grasp, let’s do every-
thing we can to get there. 
But that is not what this legislation 
is intended to attack. It doesn’t mean 
we ignore that. It means we continue 
to push. 
I have worked with my colleague on 
this side of the aisle, Congresswoman 
DEGETTE, to try to do everything we 
can to find these cures. But in the 
meantime, let’s make sure that there 
is not a diabetic who is standing at the 
pharmacy 
counter 
with 
lifesaving 
medication just beyond their reach, 
not because it is unavailable but be-
cause it is unaffordable to them. 
I take the point that while this legis-
lation doesn’t do what we all would 
like to do—and that is to reduce the 
overall cost of medication through the 
way markets actually work, negotia-
tion between a buyer and a seller. I 
mean, that is the way the free market 
works. Let’s let the free market work 
and not have law that allows the seller 
to dictate to us the price of a drug that 
can save lives and make huge profits 
while there are people in a pharmacy 
reaching for a drug that they can’t get 
because the price is too high. This leg-
islation will help save lives in the im-
mediate term. 
I hope there is a day when Democrats 
and Republicans can come together to 
establish policy that would allow nego-
tiation on the overall price of these 
lifesaving medications. That would be 
a solution. We support it; you oppose 
it. In the meantime, let’s do this and 
save some lives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
DESAULNIER) 
and 
the 
gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each 
will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair now recognizes the gen-
tleman from California. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Today, I rise in support of the Afford-
able Insulin Now Act. 
On top of weathering the economic 
fallout of the global pandemic, Ameri-
cans are still paying far too much for 
insulin. 
This 
is 
particularly 
frus-
trating, given that these are not the 
prices that consumers in the rest of the 
world pay. The most commonly used 
form of insulin costs 10 times more in 
the United States than in any other de-
veloped country. 
Tragically, there have been recent re-
ports of deaths of patients with diabe-
tes because they cannot afford the in-
sulin they need to stay alive. 
The Affordable Insulin 
Now 
Act 
would take a historic step to lower the 
cost of insulin and cap out-of-pocket 
costs at $35 per month. This means in-
dividuals with private insurance could 
save up to $500 per year. 
This bill ensures affordable access to 
lifesaving medication for the more 
than 37 million people in the United 
States who have diabetes and the over 
7 million Americans who rely on insu-
lin to maintain their health and well- 
being. 
Madam Speaker, it is past time, but 
today it is time to finally deliver on 
our promise to ensure that all Ameri-
cans can get the medication they need 
and they deserve to stay healthy and 
thrive. The Affordable Insulin Now Act 
brings us one step closer to that prom-
ise. 
There is certainly more work to be 
done. I look forward to working with 
my colleagues to get the cost of pre-
scription drugs under control and to 
build upon this important first step. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to please support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 6833. 
Americans 
are 
rightly 
concerned 
about the price of prescription drugs, 
but Democrats are trying to solve this 
problem in the wrong way, as usual. In-
stead of discussing bipartisan, com-
monsense legislation to address the ris-
ing costs of prescription drugs, we are 
debating H.R. 6833. This radical bill is 
another attempt by the left to advance 
a government takeover of prescription 
drug pricing. 
Don’t be fooled. This legislation is a 
Trojan horse. H.R. 6833 claims to ad-
dress insulin prices, but what it actu-
ally does is opens the door to govern-
ment price controls without addressing 
the root problem, which is the rising 
cost of insulin. 
H.R. 6833 won’t lower costs. It is a 
smokescreen that will raise premiums 
for workers and seniors when inflation 
is at a 40-year high. 
Why are Democrats knowingly rais-
ing healthcare premiums on the major-
ity of Americans when so many Ameri-
cans are struggling to pay for gas and 
put food on the table? Four out of five 
Americans in large group plans already 
pay under $35 a month for insulin. This

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4043 
March 31, 2022 
bill will raise healthcare costs for the 
vast majority of working Americans. 
When insurers are required by the 
Federal Government to cover an insu-
lin product, this allows manufacturers 
to raise the price of insulin indiscrimi-
nately. Since insurers can charge only 
$35 a month out of pocket to the pa-
tient, the insurer must make up for the 
increased cost of insulin by raising pre-
miums for all beneficiaries. With a 
lack of competition in the market, this 
bill removes the bargaining power in-
surers use to keep insulin prices low, 
leading to increased insulin prices and 
higher premiums. 
This legislation will only worsen the 
root problem of high insulin prices, 
which is a lack of competition in the 
market. H.R. 6833 will lead to fewer ap-
proved generic insulin brands, making 
the insulin monopoly even worse. If 
Democrats really want to decrease the 
price of insulin, they should pave the 
way for more competition, not less. 
This legislation will cost taxpayers 
$11 billion, giving the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services $1.5 million 
in fiscal year 2022 to administer these 
drug-pricing caps. Trusting the Wash-
ington bureaucracy to manage drug 
pricing and distribution is a mistake. 
This legislation would be the largest 
expansion 
of 
Federal 
control 
over 
Americans’ private health insurance 
since ObamaCare. 
We must stop the Federal Govern-
ment from wedging its foot in the door 
of our healthcare system and moving 
us one step closer to a socialist, single- 
payer system for Medicare for All. In 
fact, this week, the chair of the Pro-
gressive Caucus said she was ‘‘fighting 
to make it the law of the land.’’ 
H.R. 6833 sets a dangerous precedent. 
If the Federal Government can set 
prices for insulin, what is to stop it 
from implementing price controls for 
every drug on the market or in every 
other sector of the economy? 
The free market is the reason the 
United States outpaces every other 
country in developing lifesaving cures 
and treatments, particularly countries 
with socialized medicine. Federal drug- 
pricing mandates will discourage med-
ical innovation, resulting in fewer 
cures, which will keep Americans from 
receiving the therapies they rely upon. 
Instead of perpetuating Obama-era 
schemes to expand Federal controls 
over Americans’ health insurance, the 
Biden 
administration 
and 
congres-
sional Democrats should bring to the 
floor H.R. 19, the bipartisan Lower 
Costs, More Cures Act. 
Every single provision in H.R. 19 has 
bipartisan support. Lawmakers on both 
sides of the aisle agree that this legis-
lation will lower healthcare costs and 
protect America’s status as a leading 
healthcare innovator. 
Furthermore, H.R. 19 sets a new 
standard in healthcare affordability. 
This bill caps seniors’ out-of-pocket in-
sulin costs at only $50 a month in the 
Medicare program. It also allows for 
high-deductible 
insurance 
plans 
to 
cover insulin before a deductible kicks 
in, and it increases the availability of 
low-cost options for treatment in the 
marketplace. 
The 
cost 
of 
insulin, 
like 
most 
healthcare costs in this country, are 
climbing rapidly. Yet, total Federal 
control is not the solution. 
H.R. 6833 is a perfect example of leg-
islative trickery. This bill will lower 
out-of-pocket costs for insulin for a mi-
nority of Americans by bloating pre-
miums and other healthcare costs for 
the majority of Americans and leave 
our healthcare system worse off. 
Supporting 
socialist 
drug 
pricing 
isn’t a solution, which is why I am re-
jecting this one-sided, harmful bill. I 
urge my Democrat colleagues to sup-
port the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, 
bipartisan legislation that will lower 
drug costs for Americans without lim-
iting access to cures. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), a lead 
sponsor of this legislation and a mem-
ber of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
really appreciate Mr. DESAULNIER giv-
ing me a few moments of time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin 
Now Act. 
I want to take this time just to talk 
about the cost of healthcare and pre-
scription drugs for all those in our 
community. It is a topic that I hear 
about every single day from my con-
stituents, and it is something that 
touches the lives of every single Amer-
ican, whether you have diabetes or not. 
Today, we will be voting on a bill 
that will actually provide desperately 
needed relief to some of the most vul-
nerable patients in the United States, 
in Georgia and all across this Nation. 
There is no time off when you live 
with diabetes. It is a constant, ever- 
present disease that influences every 
aspect of your life. Listen to those who 
gave testimony about what they live 
with every single day with this chronic 
disease. 
In 1920, before insulin was discovered, 
it would have been exceptional for 
those who had diabetes to live longer 
than 1 or 2 years. But over the past 100 
years, we have been able to save lives 
with insulin. For over 100 years, it has 
remained the most effective treatment 
that we have. 
Over 100 years later, some estimates 
state that diabetics spend around $6,000 
a year alone on insulin. This is just ab-
solutely unconscionable for a drug that 
has been saving lives for over 100 years. 
We can and must make it more afford-
able for Americans who need it to live. 
That is why I joined my colleagues, 
ANGIE CRAIG and DAN KILDEE, who I 
find to be healthcare champions, in in-
troducing this critical legislation. 
It is just really very simple. The Af-
fordable Insulin Now Act would cap 
out-of-pocket costs of insulin products 
at $35 per month for Americans with 
health insurance. 
This bill brings a measure of cer-
tainty and affordability to every Amer-
ican who needs insulin to continue liv-
ing a healthy life. 
Yes, I have heard arguments this 
afternoon that this doesn’t take care of 
every individual in the country, spe-
cifically those who are uninsured. We 
know that. I assure you, we are not 
completely satisfied with this either. 
But if our Republican colleagues would 
come to the table with us, with any 
measures that you have—compromise, 
come to the table, consensus. Help us 
build the ability to make sure that 
every American in this country, wheth-
er they are insured or not, has the abil-
ity to be able to afford this lifesaving 
drug. We welcome that from you be-
cause people every single day are dying 
right beneath our noses. I am here to 
save lives. 
I look forward to passing this vital 
legislation out of the House of Rep-
resentatives today, and I look forward 
to continuing to fight for passage with 
Senator WARNOCK in the Senate. 
As the President so rightly stated, 
this legislation can and will save lives, 
and it is long overdue. 
b 1530 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, it 
is 
a 
good-sounding 
bill. 
Everyone 
knows drug costs in general are too 
high, and insulin costs in particular 
are way too high. But it is a bill with 
a simple answer. 
We look at a problem and solve the 
problem by having the Federal Reserve 
eventually print more money, $15.5 bil-
lion over 10 years. 
I realize you feel you have a pay-for 
here, but it is just by delaying another 
program by another year. And as a 
practical matter, this bill spends $15.5 
billion more over 10 years than we 
would without the bill. 
We are already told this source of 
funds—we already used this type or 
source of funds in the infrastructure 
bill. It is just grabbing another year. 
Why don’t we just require PBMs to 
pass on their rebates to the patients as 
intended? 
That 
is 
something 
that 
would cost the Federal Government, in 
my mind, no new money. It would be a 
significant reduction in cost for the in-
dividual. 
I appreciate that so many people on 
the majority side of the aisle would 
like to work together with us, and it 
shouldn’t be difficult to find a solution 
to this problem that is fair to all con-
cerned. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CASTRO), a member of the 
Education and Labor Committee. 
Mr.

Texas.

out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 per 
month and help fight the scourge of di-
abetes. 
In 2019, as chair of the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus, I organized meetings 
with leading insulin producers to con-
front them about the strain their 
prices are putting on the American 
people. 
In each of those meetings, I said the 
same thing; that for millions of Ameri-
cans, 
including 
a 
disproportionate 
number of Latinos, access to affordable 
insulin is a matter of life and death. 
And for me and many of us, those 
aren’t just numbers. Four months be-
fore I graduated from college in 1996, 
my grandmother died of complications 
from diabetes. If we fail to bring down 
the price of insulin, more families will 
suffer just like mine did. 
But our responsibility is to all our 
constituents, not just those with insur-
ance. So I co-sponsored Representative 
DOGGETT’s amendment to extend the 
benefits of this bill to the uninsured, 
and I hope we will make that happen in 
the days to come. 
But this bill is an important step for-
ward, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Person Speak-
er, and I say ‘‘Person Speaker’’ because 
I am not a biologist. And out of respect 
to our Supreme Court nominee, I don’t 
feel qualified to say Madam Speaker. 
But I do rise in opposition to this 
bill. The Affordable Insulin Now Act is 
just more of government controlling 
your healthcare. 
Today, Democrats are using insulin 
as the gateway to their dream of fully 
socialized medicine where Joe Biden 
and his accomplices in Congress have 
more control over your healthcare 
than you or your doctor. After all, they 
got to decide whether or not you got a 
vaccine, and they fired you if you 
didn’t obey. 
If Democrats succeed in setting the 
price of insulin at $35, the negative ef-
fects will ripple across the entire 
healthcare market. 
I invite my Democrat colleagues to 
read my sophomore economics text-
book to confirm what happens when 
you implement price controls. 
It is estimated the average annual 
cost for the private sector of compli-
ance with this mandate is $2 billion. 
Not that Democrats care about billions 
of dollars, the way they throw around 
trillions of dollars. Don’t tell them 
what comes after a trillion. 
But we all remember the lies of 
ObamaCare. Please, say it with me. If 
you like your doctor, you can keep 
your 
doctor. 
Come 
on. 
This 
is 
participatory. 
If 
you 
like 
your 
healthcare plan, you can keep your 
healthcare plan. As a matter of fact, 
costs are going to go down. None of 
that was true. 
And, 
instead, 
American 
families 
found 
themselves 
with 
plans 
they 
didn’t like, but at least they cost more, 
so it was a lose-lose. 
Premiums will rise again if this bill 
becomes law because setting prices, 
again, has consequences, something 
our economically illiterate Democrat 
friends apparently don’t understand, or 
maybe they do. 
American innovation has brought 
amazing, lifesaving treatments to the 
healthcare market, but that research 
and development comes at a cost, like 
any other good or product or service in 
this country. 
Don’t we all want the best drugs, the 
best medicine, and the best healthcare? 
Instead of going with the Democrat de-
fault government-knows-best, one-size- 
fits-all mentality, we need to embrace 
free market principles. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
What is the difference between us and 
them that was just on full display? 
We care about everyday Americans. 
They don’t. 
We make life better for everyday 
Americans. They don’t. 
We get things done for everyday 
Americans, and they don’t. 
Insulin is a drug that is lifesaving 
and life-sustaining. It has been around 
for more than 100 years. It is off pat-
ent. There are no research and develop-
ment costs associated with it. 
Yet so many Americans pay approxi-
mately $4,000 a year for insulin. That is 
unacceptable, un-American, and uncon-
scionable. And that is why Democrats 
are doing something about it. 
The Affordable Insulin Now Act will 
lower out-of-pocket costs to $35 per 
month. That is not fiction. That is 
fact. That is not hyperbole. That is 
help that is game-changing for every-
day Americans. Once again, Democrats 
deliver for the people. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I believe 
I have the right to close, so I will re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY of New York). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Insulin prices in the United States 
are the highest in the world. I support 
the Affordable Insulin Now Act, a bill 
that would cap patient costs at $35 a 
month. It would make lifesaving medi-
cine affordable for millions of Ameri-
cans living with diabetes. 
My committee’s investigation found 
that since the 1990s, insulin manufac-
turers have been raising the price of 
this lifesaving medicine despite no im-
provements to the drug, while making 
record profits. 
The price gouging has harmed Ameri-
cans. More than one in four Americans 
with diabetes report having to ration 
insulin, and some have died. 
Nearly 2 million New Yorkers have 
diabetes. Capping out-of-pocket costs 
to $35 a month is an important step 
that Congress can take to reduce insu-
lin costs for patients with diabetes. 
Let’s make prescription drugs afford-
able. Vote for this bill. 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
KILDEE, 
CRAIG, and MCBATH for their leadership 
in authoring this bill. 
Ms. FOXX. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleperson 
from Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I have been so pleased to hear col-
leagues across the aisle speak in favor 
of competition and price negotiations. 
I hope that they will follow through 
in their commitment to supporting 
competition and negotiation and co- 
sponsor Lower Drug Costs Now, H.R. 3. 
But that is not the bill we are talk-
ing about today. Today, we are talking 
about the Affordable Insulin Now Act, 
a bill that would make changes in the 
lives of the more than 630,000 Vir-
ginians who are living with diabetes. 
The Affordable Insulin 
Now 
Act 
would finally make sure that every af-
fected child, teenager, family member, 
every American can afford the insulin 
that they need. 
People living with diabetes do not 
have the choice of whether to purchase 
insulin or not. They depend on it to 
stay alive. People like my constituent, 
Joshua Davis, a 13-year-old Virginian 
with type 1 diabetes who accompanied 
Dr. Jill Biden to the State of the Union 
Address earlier this year. 
I am proud to co-sponsor this legisla-
tion to make sure that no American is 
skipping lifesaving doses of their insu-
lin or making choices between whether 
they take their insulin or put food on 
the table. 
I am grateful to my colleagues for 
leading this effort. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Louisiana has the second highest dia-
betes mortality rate but only the 11th 
highest number of cases. The rate of di-
abetes among Blacks, Hispanics, and 
Native American adults in the State is 
disproportionately high as compared to 
other populations. 
Insulin is a lifesaving medicine, al-
lowing people to live healthy lives, 
raise families, and do their jobs. How-
ever, many can’t afford this life-regu-
lating medicine. 
Many Louisianans have to pay over 
$100 a vial in out-of-pocket costs every 
single month. And some are forced to 
ration prescriptions, risking complica-
tions or death. The people must always 
come before Big Pharma. 
Today, we are finally taking action 
to cut the price of insulin. The Afford-
able Insulin Now Act would cap out-of-

pocket insulin costs for insulin for a 
month-long supply at $35 and require 
plans to cover different types of insu-
lin. 
The bill is a strong move in the right 
direction to ease the burden, and we 
must do this now. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I cannot let go past 
one of our colleagues saying before 
that we don’t believe in helping aver-
age people. Yes, we do. 
Republicans are here every day. We 
are average people. We are here to help 
average people. But what we believe in 
most of all is freedom for Americans. 
And we happen to believe that Demo-
crats don’t believe in that, and this bill 
is an exemplar of the fact that they 
want the government to control our 
lives in every way they possibly can. 
In the past, Democrats and Repub-
licans have worked together to bring 
down the cost of prescription drugs, 
but Democrats have once again pur-
sued politics over progress. 
H.R. 6833 is a massive power grab 
that will lead our country one step 
closer to socialized medicine. That is 
not what the American people think 
and want. 
There is no such thing as a free-mar-
ket system when government bureau-
crats control prices. This legislation 
sets an extremely dangerous precedent. 
We shouldn’t pursue policies that 
will harm the health and well-being of 
American patients, and we should not 
knowingly raise healthcare premiums 
on American workers and their fami-
lies when prices for goods are soaring. 
Republicans stand ready to work 
with Democrats to advance legislation 
that 
promotes 
competition, 
lowers 
costs for consumers, establishes trans-
parency and accountability in drug 
pricing, and advances the cause of free-
dom. 
H.R. 6833 is not that legislation. I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, Americans pay 
too much for insulin. With the price hovering at 
three times what it was 15 years ago, this vital 
medication is not just expensive, it can be 
completely out of reach. 
Every day, the more than 37 million Ameri-
cans living with diabetes must choose be-
tween the insulin they need to stay alive and 
other basic necessities. Just last week, I heard 
about this issue from a couple who live in my 
district. Both people have diabetes, but one is 
forgoing insulin for the time being due to cost. 
Last year alone, their prescription costs 
topped $10,000. 
This outrageous expense is unacceptable, 
particularly since Americans pay far more for 
insulin than patients in similar countries. In 
some cases, American patients pay as much 
as 10 times the price of their counterparts in 
other nations. 
Today’s legislation finally rights this wrong. 
Capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month 
will put the medicine within reach for millions 
of Americans. And we do this responsibly, by 
delaying the prior administration’s Rebate 
Rule. Bringing down the cost of insulin will 
also help to close health inequities that sky-
rocketing drug costs exacerbated. 
This is an important and welcome step in 
lowering the cost of prescription drugs in this 
country. More must be done, and that’s why in 
the Build Back Better Act, we empowered the 
Secretary to negotiate prescription drug prices 
for Medicare, capped Medicare Part D out-of- 
pocket costs, and required drug companies to 
pay a rebate if their prices outpace inflation. 
We will not stop until these commonsense re-
forms are signed into law. 
I applaud Ways and Means member, Con-
gressman DAN KILDEE, for his work in bringing 
this legislation to the floor, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to support the Affordable Insulin 
Now Act. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin 
Now Act, to cap the out-of-pocket price for 
one month’s supply of insulin at $35. 
Insulin was discovered nearly 100 years ago 
and costs less than $10 a vial to manufacture. 
Yet there are millions of American families 
with insurance that are paying hundreds of 
dollars a vial. 
No family in America should be forced to 
choose between buying insulin for their child 
and putting food on the table. 
It’s past time that this Congress says no to 
big pharma lining their pockets, at the ex-
pense of lives of the American people. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak in strong support of H.R. 6833, the 
Affordable Insulin Now Act. The bill is simple 
and gets to the urgent need to limit cost-shar-
ing for insulin under private health insurance 
and the Medicare prescription drug benefit. 
Specifically, the bill caps cost-sharing under 
private health insurance for a month’s supply 
of selected insulin products at $35 or 25 per-
cent of a plan’s negotiated price (after any 
price concessions), whichever is less, begin-
ning in 2023. 
The bill caps cost-sharing under the Medi-
care prescription drug benefit for insulin prod-
ucts at: 
$35 in 2023 regardless of whether a bene-
ficiary has reached the annual out-of-pocket 
spending threshold, and 
$35 beginning in 2024 for those who have 
not yet reached this threshold. 
The subject of the bill is public knowledge 
and well known by members of this body. 
I have worked closely with the healthcare 
community that serve Houstonians to ensure 
that programs are receiving the appropriate 
level of federal support. 
One of the most difficult challenges are the 
hurdles to healthcare created by lack of health 
insurance such as a lack of access to nec-
essary medications due to the high costs of 
many prescription drugs. 
Diabetes is a life-threatening disease that 
disproportionately 
affects 
communities 
of 
color. 
Diabetes is associated with serious health 
problems, including heart disease and stroke, 
kidney failure, and blindness. 
There are 15,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 
the Eighteenth Congressional District who 
have been diagnosed with diabetes. 
These individuals are my constituents and I 
know that on average, each of them pays 4.8 
times the cost of similar medication in Aus-
tralia, 3.6 times the cost in the United King-
dom, and 2.6 times the cost in Canada. 
Additionally, in the Eighteenth Congres-
sional District, 26.7 percent of residents are 
uninsured. 
For example, an uninsured resident of this 
congressional district pays 23 times more for 
this brand of insulin than their counterparts in 
Australia, 15 times more than they would in 
the United Kingdom, and 13 times more than 
they would in Canada. 
The consequences of these staggering 
costs are not benign. 
Many patients often speak of having to 
make heartwrenching decisions about what to 
buy with the commonly fixed incomes attend-
ant to seniors. 
Many medical professionals indicate that the 
high prices for prescription drugs are a func-
tion of a lack of competition, and authorizing 
Medicare to create a program to negotiate 
drug prices may be an estimable way to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs. 
All told this reflects a disturbing trend: in our 
country, the cost of branded drugs tends to go 
up, whereas in other countries, the costs tend 
to go down. 
Before insulin the prognosis for diabetics 
was bleak. 
Over the past two decades, manufacturers 
have systematically and dramatically raised 
the prices of their insulin products by more 
than tenfold—often in lockstep. 
In 2017, diabetes contributed to the death of 
277,000 Americans and was the primary death 
for 85,000 of those individuals 
That same year diagnosed diabetes cost the 
United States an estimated $327 billion—in-
cluding $237 billion in direct medical costs and 
$90 billion in productivity losses. 
Diabetes drugs, including insulin and oral 
medications that regulate blood sugar levels, 
play a critical role in helping people with dia-
betes manage their condition and reduce the 
risk of diabetes-related health complications. 
Although insulin is the most well-known dia-
betes medication, diabetes patients are often 
prescribed other oral drugs to use in place of 
or alongside insulin. 
Many of these non-insulin products used to 
regulate blood sugar levels are brand drugs 
that lack generic alternatives. 
In recent years, the high prices of diabetes 
drugs have placed a tremendous strain on dia-
betes patients as well as the federal govern-
ment, which provides diabetes medications to 
more than 43 million Medicare beneficiaries. 
Because Medicare lacks the authority to ne-
gotiate directly with drug manufacturers, Medi-
care beneficiaries pay significantly more for 
their drugs than patients abroad. 
Patients who are uninsured or underinsured 
and must pay for their drugs out of pocket 
bear an even greater cost burden. 
I thank the committees on Energy and Com-
merce, Ways and Means, and Education and 
Labor for the work they have done to bring 
H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin Now Act to 
the floor for a vote. 
I encourage my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to vote in support of H.R. 6833. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1017, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time.

Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, pursu-
ant to the order of the House of March

H.R. 4521. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Lucas moves that the managers on the 
part of the House at the conference on the 
disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4521 be 
instructed to agree to section 2502 of the 
Senate amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 7 of rule XXII, the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
and the gentlewoman from Michigan 
(Ms. STEVENS) each will control 30 min-
utes. The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this motion to instruct 
the conferees on our competitiveness 
legislation. 
This motion instructs 
conference 
members to agree to section 2502 of the 
Senate legislation. This section is sim-
ple and common sense. It says that no 
person or entity of concern can receive 
grants, awards, or other support from 
the National Science Foundation, fed-
erally funded manufacturing programs, 
or technology hubs authorized by this 
legislation. 
A person or entity of concern is gen-
erally defined by the Department of 
Defense as directed by Congress in pre-
vious Defense Reauthorization Acts. 
DOD has identified entities of con-
cern as Communist Chinese military 
companies and companies owned or 
controlled by the People’s Liberation 
Army, and they have defined persons of 
concern as individuals affiliated with 
these CCP military entities. 
Simply put, this motion ensures that 
we aren’t giving taxpayer dollars to 
the adversaries who are trying to steal 
U.S. technology and use it against us. 
The Senate was right to add this im-
portant guardrail, and it is only re-
sponsible that we urge our House con-
ferees to ensure it is included in the 
final conferenced legislation. 
I would like to point out that we 
wouldn’t 
have 
this 
particular 
dif-
ference in our bills had the process of 
passing the House legislation been done 
in regular order.

with very little input or review from 
relevant committees. 
Although thoroughly vetted and bi-
partisan Science Committee bills were 
included in that package, they were 
sandwiched in among unrelated, par-
tisan spending that added up to a back-
door attempt to pass parts of the Build 
Back Better Act. Because of this 
rushed, opaque bill-writing process, 
unsurprisingly, the COMPETES Act 
had a lot of flaws. 
Despite less than 3 days to review the 
bill text, Members submitted more 
than 600 amendments to the bill. But 
the Rules Committee, with very little 
input, made in order only 261; and of 
that number, only three Republican 
amendments were given individual de-
bate time on the floor, with all other 
Republican amendments being consid-
ered en bloc. Not only did Members 
have little opportunity to write this 
bill, but they also had almost no oppor-
tunity to fix its flaws. 
I could go on about the danger of 
passing massive bills like this out of 
regular order, but for now I will focus 
on this particular issue. This provision 
preventing funds from going to Chinese 
military entities and persons of con-
cern was submitted as a part of mul-
tiple Republican amendments to the 
Rules Committee, but none of these 
amendments were made in order. I fail 
to see how amendments limiting tax-
payer funds from going to China isn’t 
relevant to a bill about competitive-
ness with China. 
Democrats’ failure to include similar 
language in the COMPETES Act is an 
unfortunate example of an unwilling-
ness to be strong on China and protect 
our national security. But we have a 
chance to rectify that now. 
Madam Speaker, surely we can all 
agree that we shouldn’t be sending tax-
payer dollars to Communist leadership 
in China. They are already stealing our 
discoveries and using them to surpass 
us economically and militarily. We are 
spending the time, money, and effort to 
plant the seeds of new technologies, 
but China is the one harvesting the 
crop. 
We have a once-in-a-generation op-
portunity to pass legislation to im-
prove U.S. technology and to set us up 
to be globally competitive for the com-
ing decade. 
The Science Committee has spent 2 
years preparing for this opportunity. 
Working together, Republicans and 
Democrats held meetings with stake-
holders, conducted in-depth hearings, 
and individually marked up more than 
a dozen bills to strategically scale-up 
America’s research and development 
capacities. 
Those bills all passed out of com-
mittee unanimously, and many passed 
across the floor with strong bipartisan 
support. They double down on invest-
ment in basic research at the National 
Science Foundation, the Department of 
Energy Office of Science and National 
Labs, and the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology. 
They also direct the creation and 
regular review of a national science 
and technology strategy, as well as im-
proving STEM education and regional 
research opportunities. 
The Science Committee bills are tar-
geted to the areas where government 
investment is most needed and will 
give us the biggest reward. We ensure 
our approach is strategic, focusing on 
the technologies of the future like 
quantum 
sciences, 
artificial 
intel-
ligence, and advanced manufacturing. 
We will keep America competitive and 
secure and help create good jobs here 
at home. 
This legislation should be the founda-
tion for the conference legislation, not 
the COMPETES Act, which is more of 
a climate change bill than a tech-
nology bill, and not the bill formerly 
known as USICA, which is a grab-bag 
of special interest provisions cobbled 
together into a franken-bill. 
There is a lot of chaff to separate 
from the wheat of this bill, but I be-
lieve we can come to smart, consensus 
policy through the conference. The 
Science Committee worked together to 
pass strong bipartisan legislation, and 
I think our process, as well as our end 
result, should serve as a model moving 
forward. 
I am looking forward to getting to 
work and paring down these bills to the 
smart policies we need. It is urgent 
that we act now. Democratic leader-
ship delayed the legislation for 9 
months. I assure you the Chinese Com-
munist Party isn’t doing the same. 
Let’s stop playing politics with some-
thing so important. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass this motion, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong and enthusiastic support of 
moving forward to conference the 
America COMPETES Act of 2022 with 
the Senate. 
For those watching back at home, a 
conference committee is a joint com-
mittee between the House and Senate, 
a temporary ad hoc configuration to 
negotiate elements of a bill; and it is, 
frankly, the best of legislative action; 
Congress working for the American 
people, debating through democracy 
and deliberation to produce an end re-
sult. 
As a Member of Congress, I often ask 
myself, I often pose the question, what 
will drive our economy for the next 10 
years, 20 years, 30 years? What is our 
moonshot of the next 50 years? What 
can I do today to ensure that my 
neighbors in southeast Michigan are on 
a strong path to a successful future? 
What are the technologies and research 
investments that we can make today 
to ensure the success of the Nation for 
all of us? 
The legislation that we are moving 
to conference today, the America COM-
PETES Act, tackles those big ques-
tions and secures our competitive edge 
for generations to come. This bill is an 
investment in our people. It reflects 
our ability to reach higher, to think 
deeper, and to invent solutions to not 
only today’s problems but solutions for 
tomorrow’s opportunities. 
Americans 
are 
known 
for 
their 
hustle, for their ingenuity. My job, our 
job in Congress is to connect people to 
the tools to unlock a good life, to con-
nected opportunity for everyone. And, 
frankly, the tools of the future are in 
this bill. 
The COMPETES Act turbocharges 
America’s scientific research and tech-
nological leadership while strength-
ening America’s economic and national 
security at home and abroad. Even 
more, this bold investment in innova-
tion ensures our top scientific minds 
have the tools to rise to the challenge 
of our climate crisis, from clean energy 
technologies to emissions measure-
ment. 
Not only does this bill look to the fu-
ture, but it also mends the acute 
stressors that we are all feeling today 
due to our years of Federal under-
investment in science and innovation. 
A conference committee to discuss 
this, my friends, the America COM-
PETES Act tackles our supply chain 
vulnerabilities to make more goods in 
America and surges production of 
American-made semiconductors, chips, 
that which we invented here in this Na-
tion, and in the 1990s were producing 40 
percent of a crucial component in ev-
erything from cars to computers to 
medical devices. And the American 
people are ready; ready for investments 
that will spur innovative solutions to 
create jobs across the Nation, support 
American manufacturing, and build a 
strong and diverse STEM workforce 
ready to address the challenges we face 
as a Nation.

During President Biden’s State of the 
Union Address, he called on Congress 
to get our innovation package to him 
for his signature. So we should be 
proud—I certainly am—to be here as 
we move to take the next step in this 
process. There is, frankly, no time to 
waste in getting the COMPETES Act 
to the President’s desk. 
As the chairwoman of the Sub-
committee on Research and Tech-
nology, I am so proud of the range of 
bipartisan Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee provisions that have 
long been championed that are in-
cluded in this package. 
I am especially proud of the NIST for 
the Future Act, my legislation. This 
critical investment in NIST will ensure 
the agency and its employees have the 
resources they require to be a key part 
of bolstering our American technology 
enterprise: a resilient supply chain, 
small and midsize manufacturers being 
brought to the table to deliver for 
America, and the American workforce 
that compels them. 
Since Michigan’s 11th District sent 
me to Congress, I have been laser-fo-
cused on bringing innovation economy

solutions not only to folks in south-
eastern Michigan but also, obviously, 
all across the United States. 
We built a transformative piece of 
legislation from the ground up. The 
ranking member is right—bipartisan 
years of work on the Science, Space, 
and Technology Committee to do such 
legislation. We heard from the science 
community. We heard from industry. 
We heard from academia. We heard 
from other stakeholders. They all told 
us the same thing: Don’t leave Ameri-
cans behind. Don’t leave anyone behind 
based on geography or demographics. 
Bring the scientific research enterprise 
to all. 
We are here, and we are here with a 
lot of hardworking people from the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee staff. We have not had a con-
ference committee since 2018, albeit for 
NDAA. Many people have not been able 
to be privy to such an action, and they 
deserve our gratitude. These are the 
folks writing the text late into the 
night based on our corrections, the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee staff who work so hard and the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee members. 
The United States has long been a 
beacon of excellence in science and in-
novation, and it is long overdue that 
we restore Federal support for these 
vital initiatives, that we invest now 
and lead the world. 
The House’s and Senate’s approaches 
may certainly have some differences, 
but we seek the same goal: to deliver 
for this Nation. 
I am very confident that we will have 
a very productive conference process 
and hope to get the America COM-
PETES Act to President Biden’s desk 
for signature very soon. 
The U.S. has endless potential to 
compete globally in science and inno-
vation. The America COMPETES Act 
provides the critical resources and 
tools we need to achieve that. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues throughout conference to 
invest in America’s most valuable re-
source, the talent of our people. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, last month, the 
House passed the COMPETES Act, bet-
ter known as the concedes act, which 
was forced through this Chamber in a 
partisan fashion and lacked the poli-
cies needed to truly bolster our sci-
entific 
infrastructure 
and 
combat 
threats from our foreign adversaries. 
The hard work and the bipartisan 
collaboration of the Science, Space, 
and Technology Committee were left in 
the wake of partisan politics. 
The House-passed concedes act let 
China off the hook very simply for fail-
ing to contain COVID–19. It failed to 
ban funding to CCP-tied organizations. 
It failed to punish the CCP for its bla-
tant human rights abuses. It failed to 
strengthen America’s competitive edge 
over China. 
Today, we have the opportunity to 
instruct conferees to bolster the lan-
guage and actually stand up against 
Communist China. 
That is why I support this motion to 
instruct. It will ensure that no entities 
identified as Chinese military compa-
nies operating in the United States are 
eligible to receive funds through the 
new technology directorate, the supply 
chain resiliency program that we set 
up through Manufacturing Extension 
Partnership. 
We must put a stop to Communist 
China spreading misinformation, steal-
ing our technology, and bolstering its 
economic advantages while weakening 
ours. The FBI and intelligence agencies 
have 
continually 
warned 
Congress 
about these same threats from Com-
munist China. 
China’s investment in development, 
and not in basic research, implies that 
they are building their technological 
success on the backs of U.S.-funded 
basic research. 
We have even seen the infiltration of 
Chinese influence in our university sys-
tems and academia on several different 
occasions at the top institutions of 
America. We must work to ensure that 
China cannot undermine our open sys-
tem of research and development. 
This time, let’s support scientific dis-
covery, advance American technology, 
and hold our foreign adversaries ac-
countable, and let’s not waste the 
American people’s time again. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, the 
ranking member, the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS), has given us a 
motion to instruct, a negotiation that 
we will pursue in the conference to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE). 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, we 
are at a crucial moment in our Na-
tion’s history, and Congress has the 
chance to reinvigorate our economy 
and ensure that we can outcompete 
every other nation. 
The America COMPETES Act will 
put us on a course to lead the pack in 
creating the strongest and most ad-
vanced economy of the 21st century. 
Today’s actions move us one step clos-
er to making this legislation a reality. 
Over the past 40 years, America’s 
manufacturing sector has lost market 
share to economic competitors like 
China. This decline in manufacturing, 
coupled with the COVID–19 pandemic, 
has led to severe supply chain disrup-
tions across our economy that have 
raised prices for consumers. 
As the chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, I would like to 
highlight several important provisions 
in the America COMPETES Act that 
will help reverse this trend, strengthen 
our economy, bolster our Nation’s sup-
ply chains, and ensure that more crit-
ical goods are made right here in the 
United States. 
The legislation invests $45 billion in 
grants, loans, and loan guarantees to 
support supply chain resilience and 
manufacturing of critical goods, indus-
trial equipment, and manufacturing 
technology right here in the U.S. 
It also invests $52 billion for the 
CHIPS for America Act, incentivizing 
private-sector investments in semicon-
ductor fabrication. This funding will 
help eliminate disruptions in the semi-
conductor supply chain from abroad 
that have hurt American automakers, 
medical supply chain companies, and 
manufacturers of heavy machinery. 
The bill invests $3 billion to help 
build a domestic solar manufacturing 
supply chain so we can aggressively 
counter China’s control of the solar 
chain that jeopardizes our energy secu-
rity interests. The bill also keeps our 
electric grid secure and resilient in the 
face of evolving cybersecurity and 
physical security threats. 
Madam Speaker, the America COM-
PETES Act also improves our medical 
product supply chain and strengthens 
our Strategic National Stockpile. Dur-
ing the early days of the COVID–19 
pandemic, there were widespread short-
ages of essential medicines, medical 
supplies, and some personal protective 
equipment. 
This legislation increases our domes-
tic drug manufacturing base by ex-
panding the use of advanced and con-
tinuous manufacturing practices. It 
also establishes a $1.5 billion supply 
chain manufacturing pilot program 
that will help maintain domestic re-
serves of critical medical supplies. It 
creates a $10.5 billion program that 
awards grants to States to expand or 
maintain a State strategic stockpile of 
products essential in the event of a 
public health emergency. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, the Amer-
ica COMPETES Act will help innovate 
our wireless supply chain and network 
security by funding the deployment of 
cutting-edge technology and ensuring 
that next-generation mobile wireless 
networks and technologies are safe and 
secure from foreign adversaries. 
Madam Speaker, for far too long, 
America has relied heavily on other na-
tions to manufacture critical goods es-
sential to our economy. That must 
come to an end as we work together to 
reinvigorate our manufacturing base 
and create new, good-paying jobs here 
at home. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Oklahoma for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
Ranking Member LUCAS’ motion to in-
struct. 
This motion will agree with section 
2502 included in USICA, which pro-
hibits entities identified as Chinese 
military 
companies 
from 
receiving

funds through the new technology di-
rectorate, the supply chain resiliency 
program, the regional innovation pro-
gram, or the Manufacturing USA pro-
gram. 
In other words, this motion ensures 
taxpayer dollars spent in this bill do 
not go toward the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
On the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee, we spent several 
months working on a series of bipar-
tisan competitiveness bills that we 
could have gone to conference with. 
Unfortunately, with little notice, we 
voted on a 3,000-page bill that was not 
bipartisan, did not include strong pro-
tections to safeguard U.S. investments 
from CCP, and provided $8 billion for a 
climate slush fund that we have zero 
oversight over and China has already 
taken $100 million from. 
Republicans offered several amend-
ments with similar language to that of 
Ranking Member LUCAS’ motion to in-
struct in the Rules Committee, but un-
fortunately, the majority did not allow 
them to be considered on the House 
floor. 
The CCP is watching us. Today, we 
have an opportunity to send a strong 
bipartisan and bicameral message: We 
are bolstering American competitive-
ness and national security to ensure we 
lead in the development and deploy-
ment of the technologies of the future. 
It is imperative we have guardrails, 
such as Mr. LUCAS’ motion to instruct, 
in order to ensure these investments do 
not fall into the hands of the CCP and 
to attain a true bipartisan, bicameral 
agreement. 
I thank Ranking Member LUCAS for 
his leadership and his motion. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
and allowing me to speak on this. 
I think it is worth the wait to bring 
these important provisions together to 
the floor to work on a path forward and 
maybe a little hint of restoring regular 
order. 
It is important that we invest in in-
novation for our future. And I would 
note not just the cutting edge, high- 
tech future developments that are so 
important in my State and in many 
others that are going to help keep us 
on the front lines, but it is also impor-
tant to invest in legacy technology, 
legacy chips. 
We had the manufacturing supply 
chain all over America halt for lack of 
chips that cost only a few pennies be-
cause it wasn’t profitable for some to 
create the legacy chips moving for-
ward. And I hope some of these billions 
will be invested in opportunities to 
ramp up that production. It happened 
very fast, and it will make a difference 
from automobiles to microwaves and 
washing machines. 
I am proud of the work we have done 
in the Ways and Means Committee 
under the leadership of RICHIE NEAL to 
develop pro-worker responsive efforts 
and deal with the Chinese challenge. 
Now, because the benefits of trade 
are broadly understood and spread but 
the problems are localized, the impacts 
often hit individual communities. That 
is why our provision has a strong Trade 
Adjustment 
Assistance 
program. 
Sadly, it expired a year ago, setting us 
back, leaving people desperately in 
need of this help out of luck. 
We have a very strong, carefully 
crafted provision that will help work-
ers and communities alike with an up-
dated, modernized Trade Adjustment 
Assistance program. 
We hear a lot of concerns about 
China, and I share those concerns. Our 
provisions are tough on China. 
For instance, we closed the de mini-
mis loophole that allows 2 million 
packages a day to be imported into the 
United States directly to our con-
sumers, uninspected in the main and 
evading tariffs. It is time for us to 
close that de minimis loophole. 
I note that the Chinese give Ameri-
cans $7 of an exemption, and ours is 
$800. The least we ought to do is close 
that de minimis loophole. 
The trade title is strongly supported 
by American business and organized 
labor. We are dealing with a TSP and 
MTB that will improve global stand-
ards and strengthen American manu-
facturing. 
The title is supported by AFL–CIO, 
American Alliance of Manufacturers, 
the 
autoworkers, 
machinists, 
elec-
tricians. People who want to build 
products in America are advantaged 
under this. 
It meets workers’ needs, bolsters 
America’s ability to compete, and is 
attuned to what Americans want. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
the work with the committee moving 
this forward, and ultimately, its pas-
sage. 
b 1615 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oregon for 
reminding us about the importance of 
legacy chips and the MTB. I also thank 
the previous gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for reminding us about Manufac-
turing USA, which was probably start-
ed under the Obama administration. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the motion 
to instruct from my colleague and 
Oklahoma 
delegation 
member, 
Mr. 
LUCAS. 
Safeguarding our national security, 
improving our supply chain resiliency, 
and bolstering American innovation 
are things that we can all agree on. 
However, 
in 
the 
COMPETES 
Act, 
Democrats took these problems and 
drafted ineffective, partisan policies in 
response. As a member of the House 
Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology, we had previously ad-
vanced strong legislation to combat 
these very issues. 
On top of this, when this legislation 
came to the House floor for a vote in 
February, Republicans in the House 
were denied the opportunity to provide 
input 
on 
these 
important 
issues 
through the restrictive processes of the 
majority. 
While over 600 amendments were sub-
mitted, less than half of those were 
made in order by the Committee on 
Rules. Of the 600, there were a number 
that would have taken steps to address 
the ever-growing threat we face from 
the Chinese Communist Party and 
their affiliated companies operating in 
the United States. 
This motion to instruct will ensure 
that the critical investments we are 
making in America’s innovation don’t 
fall into the hands of our foreign adver-
saries. 
Democrats’ failure to include similar 
provisions in the COMPETES Act ex-
emplify their continued, weak policies 
on China that compromise our stra-
tegic advantage and our national secu-
rity. 
It is common sense that U.S. tax-
payer dollars should not be lining the 
pockets of the Chinese Communist 
Party, and instead, should be used to 
strengthen 
our 
industries 
here 
at 
home. Investing in American compa-
nies will strengthen the economy while 
keeping the Nation safe. 
Madam Speaker, this should not be a 
partisan issue. I encourage the adop-
tion of the motion. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS). 
Mr. 
MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman from Michigan 
for yielding the time. 
Madam Speaker, we find ourselves in 
a competition to lead in the 21st cen-
tury. And that is a competition that 
the United States cannot afford to lose, 
and if we do what we should do here, 
will not lose. 
A month ago, Vladimir Putin and Xi 
Jinping thought that America was in 
decline, that America could no longer 
lead the world, and that they could 
therefore simply overwhelm smaller 
states. They believed that they could 
undermine the rules-based order when-
ever they chose. 
Well, this incredible global coalition, 
binding and getting us together, work-
ing with our allies, that President Joe 
Biden has put together to condemn 
Russia and support the Ukrainian peo-
ple, has proven that their assertion is 
absolutely wrong. But the events of the 
past month have underscored the need 
to position America for this challenge 
on a long-term basis. 
Therefore, it is absolutely critical 
that Congress get H.R. 4521 to the 
President’s desk. It is an investment in 
science, innovation, and technology, 
which would allow us to excel in the 
global economy for decades, bolster our 
domestic industry, and create jobs for 
American workers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4050 
March 31, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I am proud that my 
bill, the EAGLE Act, serves as the for-
eign affairs division of America COM-
PETES. It bolsters our diplomacy to 
marshal a coalition of states to check 
the PRC’s aggression, its theft of tech-
nology, its shirking of global rules, and 
its gross violation of human rights, of 
which we need to focus on. 
And I know that if we put our minds 
to it, we can work together in a bipar-
tisan and bicameral way to finalize 
this critical legislation and get it to 
the President’s desk, and we must do 
it. 
That is because our allies and part-
ners in the Indo-Pacific are watching. 
They need our help to bolster inter-
national rules, combat the PRC’s coer-
cion, and address shared global chal-
lenges like climate change. And after 
what we have seen in Ukraine, the peo-
ple of Taiwan are watching, to ensure 
that we deepen our economic ties, 
strengthen its defense, and create 
greater space for Taiwan globally. 
Hong Kongers and Uyghurs are also 
watching to make sure we get this 
done because they urgently need the 
refugee protections that are in the 
COMPETES Act. They need Congress 
to send a message to Beijing that its 
genocide in Xinjiang, its destruction of 
Hong Kong’s autonomy, and its lack of 
regard for human rights will not stand. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, we 
are lucky to have such a chair of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs here in 
the Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. WESTERMAN). 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
in a peewee sports competition, you 
can make the case that if you are com-
peting, you are winning. But when it 
comes to global standing, energy inde-
pendence, and economic security, there 
are no participation trophies. Our goal 
can’t be to just compete. We have to 
dominate because if we are not winning 
in this area, we are losing. And if 
America loses, the world loses. 
Unfortunately, this so-called COM-
PETES Act would place America on 
the loser’s bench. I am baffled why, at 
a time when gas prices are sky-
rocketing from Putin’s war in Ukraine, 
and more Americans than ever are fac-
ing economic instability, this majority 
is still laser-focused on a blind, green- 
energy political agenda when America 
needs a rational, domestic energy plan 
that results in reliable, affordable, and 
clean energy. 
Our constituents are paying almost 
$5 a gallon to fill their cars. Yet, I am 
hearing my Democrat colleagues sug-
gest the solution is just to buy an elec-
tric vehicle. What a slap in the face to 
thousands of hardworking men and 
women that President Biden put out of 
their jobs by canceling pipelines and 
shuttering 
American 
mines, 
while 
turning to international adversaries 
like Russia, China, Iran, and Venezuela 
to solve the energy and mineral crisis 
he created. 
Madam Speaker, no, if we really 
want to win, we must unleash the full 
power of American energy and mineral 
development by processing permits, 
issuing leases, streamlining the regu-
latory process, and giving our own 
homegrown industries the ability to 
use our American resources. We can 
and we will do that safer, cleaner and 
faster than anyone else in the world. 
Where China uses child and slave 
labor to mine minerals vital to bat-
teries and computers, we can use state- 
of-the-art technology to access those 
minerals that are right here in the U.S. 
Where Russia controls oil rights and 
uses it as political leverage, we can 
produce energy for our own people and 
be an exporter to our allies. 
Madam Speaker, we have no other 
option than to win. 
I urge my colleagues to give Ameri-
cans the power to develop, innovate, 
and unleash our full potential. If you 
look around, Democrat strategies are 
proving to be losing strategies. Ameri-
cans can’t afford higher prices and 
more incompetence. Let’s begin to put 
an end to the madness by passing this 
motion to instruct. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage that. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
LURIA). The gentlewoman from Michi-
gan has 133⁄4 minutes remaining. The 
gentleman from Oklahoma has 15 min-
utes remaining. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, as 
the gentleman from Arkansas reminds 
us, I am proud that Michigan is the 
destination where the combustion en-
gine was invented and innovated, and 
very proud to be the destination where 
our workers are manifesting and inno-
vating electric vehicles. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I con-
fess, I cannot connect my friend from 
Arkansas’ comments with this motion 
to instruct, but I won’t take any time 
to refute these things. 
Madam Speaker, manufacturing has 
long been a core strength of the Amer-
ican economy. But the decades-long de-
cline of manufacturing jobs in the 
United States has cut off pathways to 
economic security for so many families 
across this country. 
Passage of the America COMPETES 
Act will be a landmark investment in 
infrastructure, in clean technology, in 
innovation that will create and pre-
serve high-quality jobs in communities 
across America, and advance U.S. com-
petitiveness and drive long-term eco-
nomic growth. 
Disinvestment in American home-
made products has also contributed to 
the severe supply chain disruptions 
during the coronavirus pandemic that 
have pushed up prices for so many 
American 
consumers. 
The 
America 
COMPETES Act will bolster supply 
chains, ramp up domestic manufac-
turing of critical components, like 
semiconductors, 
and 
insulate 
U.S. 
workers and families from price vola-
tility and help build their own eco-
nomic resilience. 
Part of the House-passed version is 
the National Secure Data Service Act, 
which will allow agencies to link to-
gether data collected through surveys, 
Federal program administration, non-
governmental data sources to advance 
evidence-based policymaking. This will 
be a great boon for artificial intel-
ligence and machine learning. 
Also included in the COMPETES Act, 
is an amendment I cosponsored with 
Representative TRAHAN to increase in-
vestment in fusion energy, the holy 
grail for our climate and for world pov-
erty. 
The COMPETES Act bottom line 
gives the U.S. the competitive edge 
needed to maintain our global leader-
ship in innovation and research. 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure why 
my Republican friends felt the need to 
offer this motion in the first place. Of 
course, we all understand that the es-
sential subtext of the COMPETES Act 
has been to strengthen our competitive 
position versus communist China or, to 
restate my friend from Arkansas, to 
put us in the dominant position to 
compete against communist China. 
Of course, nothing in this landmark 
initiative in American research, in 
American 
innovation, 
in 
American 
manufacturing, American artificial in-
telligence or American chips is in-
tended to be transferred to the PRC. So 
if this is meant to show that Repub-
licans are tougher on China than 
Democrats, that is silly and untrue. 
Together, 
we 
will 
fight 
China’s 
human rights abuses. We will fight its 
cheating on trade. We will fight its 
autocratic, 
dictatorial 
government. 
And the COMPETES Act gives us the 
strength we need to do that today. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. MCCAUL). 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the Chinese Com-
munist Party poses a generational 
threat to the United States and our 
freedom-loving allies around the world. 
They are brutally oppressing their 
own people. They are committing geno-
cide against ethnic and religious mi-
norities. They are expanding their 
military reach and carrying out terri-
torial aggression against their neigh-
bors. We cannot wait any longer to ad-
dress these issues. 
Madam Speaker, I stand before you, 
quite frankly, disappointed. We had a 
great opportunity here, and this bill 
that passed the House is not the bill. I 
am very hopeful we can get to a good 
place in our conference committee. 
Unfortunately, the Democrat leaders 
chose not to work with Republicans to 
pass a substantive, meaningful bill to 
counter this malign influence. Instead,

March 31, 2022 
they jammed the partisan COMPETES 
Act through the House. 
The COMPETES Act, in my judg-
ment, is a Trojan horse filled with 
unserious, dangerous, and wasteful pro-
visions. 
b 1630 
Those provisions include fringe, pro-
gressive priorities, like $8 billion worth 
of taxpayer money into an unaccount-
able U.N. slush fund. This U.N. slush 
fund has already provided at least $100 
million directly to China, a country 
that this Congress, former Republican 
administration, and current Democrat 
administration have all agreed is com-
mitting genocide. 
In fact, it is worse. The Xinjiang 
Province—you get this money to make 
solar panels and batteries in the 
Xinjiang Province where they commit 
genocide itself. That is not good for 
America and it is certainly not good 
for the U.S. taxpayer. 
Secretary Kerry admitted before our 
committee that the CCP is using slave 
labor to make these green energy prod-
ucts—like solar panels and batteries— 
that could be used by this U.N. fund. In 
effect, the bill would fund their slave 
labor and prop up their forced abor-
tions. We tried to stop this from hap-
pening—to stop U.S. taxpayers from 
funding slave labor in my motion to re-
commit, and shockingly, we were out-
right rejected by the Democrats. 
The motion to recommit prohibited 
taxpayer money going to slave labor, 
genocide, and the Wuhan Lab, and 
every Democrat voted against that 
measure. This is a test of our time. 
Madam Speaker, so I remain the 
eternal optimist and hopeful that this 
conference process will be able to rec-
tify these glaring issues that I have 
outlined. We can start today by sup-
porting this motion that will block bil-
lions of dollars going to the CCP mili-
tary PLA companies and human rights 
abusers. 
Congress owes it to the American 
people to pass a bill that takes this 
threat seriously. That includes tough 
export controls, outbound investment 
screening and funding for the CHIPS 
for America Act, which I introduced, to 
give us a competitive edge, bring man-
ufacturing to the United States to 
make advanced semiconductor chips 
and protect our national security at 
the same time. 
This is vitally important to our na-
tional security, and it keeps critical 
U.S. technology out of the hands of the 
Chinese military, like hypersonics. It 
ensures U.S. taxpayers are not sub-
sidizing their genocide. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this motion to in-
struct. I hope we can all work together 
in a bipartisan manner on what could 
be the most important legislation of 
this Congress. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I join the ranking 
member in being optimistic because we 
are in a conference committee negoti-
ating the America COMPETES Act, we 
will get this CHIPS legislation done. 
Proudly, I have led 29 Democrats and 29 
Republicans in endorsing the CHIPS 
Act legislation, so it will be bipartisan. 
It will get done for the American peo-
ple, and we will solve some of our sup-
ply chain woes. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TONKO). 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I am 
very proud of the efforts that have 
been made by the House to advance 
COMPETES, an act that is about in-
vestment; a bipartisan effort promoted 
with higher prioritization by the lead-
ership of this House to address invest-
ment: investment in research, invest-
ment in workforce, investment in man-
ufacturing. 
It is so important that we are now in-
vesting in research as the COMPETES 
Act requires so that we create the next 
generation of product line and chips. It 
is important to invest in that pipeline 
of workers that will have those preci-
sion-oriented skills in an innovation 
economy that requires such precision. 
It is important that we retrofit our 
manufacturing centers so as to com-
pete and compete effectively. 
I am impressed by the fact that we 
have taken the strengths of so many 
committees and brought them into the 
forefront of COMPETES to make cer-
tain that we invest in the CHIPS for 
America Act. I have industries for 
microelectronics, and certainly the 
semiconductor 
industry 
that 
are 
hosted in the 20th Congressional Dis-
trict that I am honored to represent. 
They deserve and they require, more 
importantly, a partnership with the 
Federal Government. Those resources 
will be there with the passage of this 
bill as we bring together a consensus. 
We will invest in that $52 billion 
worth of investment for the chips in-
dustry, the CHIPS for America Act. We 
will make certain that a bill that I au-
thored, the Micro Act, is incorporated 
in the context of COMPETES, and that 
will complement the provisions in 
CHIPS by making certain that we ac-
celerate early stage microelectronics 
research to feed into the national semi-
conductor technology center. 
It is so important to have that cut-
ting-edge investment so that we can 
lead the world in innovation, and mak-
ing certain also that we promote 
strong global leadership by positioning 
the interests and the values of our 
United States, not China, to win on the 
world stage, including with strong ac-
tion to hold the PRC accountable for 
its trade abuses which hurt U.S. work-
ers, and for its human rights viola-
tions. 
The America COMPETES Act will 
elevate American leadership in the 
global arena, putting diplomacy first, 
strengthening our alliances, combating 
unfair trade practices, and standing up 
for our national values. 
The COMPETES Act ensures that 
American goods are made in America 
by American workers and boosts com-
petition addressing supply bottlenecks, 
strengthening U.S. manufacturing, and 
lowering those kitchen table costs. 
This is a measure that is all-inclu-
sive. It is the boldest, strongest state-
ment on competitiveness for America. 
It is the great strength of COMPETES 
that I hope will carry us now into an 
innovation economy with the work-
force prepared to go, a research invest-
ment that gives us the vision and teth-
ers that vision into future product 
lines and chips development, and that 
will allow for us to strengthen our 
manufacturing partnership. They re-
quire that assistance and they require 
our partnership. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to strongly support Mr. LUCAS’ 
motion to instruct conferees on the 
American COMPETES Act. 
The House-passed version of the bill 
should really have been called—as a 
number of my colleagues have men-
tioned—the American concedes act. 
Democratic leadership cobbled this leg-
islation together from mostly partisan 
bills without Republican support, in 
stark contrast to what our colleagues 
in the Senate did. 
As ranking member of the Asia-Pa-
cific Subcommittee, which has juris-
diction over China, I am deeply dis-
appointed by the partisan nature and 
the substance, in many ways, of this 
House-passed bill. 
Competing with China should not be 
a partisan issue. On every front, the 
Chinese Communist Party is aggres-
sively challenging the free world and 
our belief that open societies and free 
markets, and, yes, rule of law are the 
way to a prosperous and equitable civ-
ilization. 
After decades of inaction, it is time 
to reevaluate our basic approach to-
ward engagement with China. The 
Democrats’ bill doesn’t do that. When 
Republicans attempted to amend the 
bill to make it better, the Democrats 
rejected virtually every one of those 
attempts. 
I would like to highlight two particu-
larly concerning omissions from the 
House bill. First, we should have adopt-
ed 
provisions 
to 
modernize 
and 
strengthen our relationship with Tai-
wan which, by the way, got bipartisan 
support in the Senate. 
Second, we should also have used the 
opportunity to advance strong export 
control policies to ensure that our crit-
ical technologies do not advance the 
PRC’s own drive for technological su-
premacy. 
Moving forward, as we seek to bridge 
the gap between the House and Senate 
bills, let’s have these three priorities in 
mind. First, the CCP, the Chinese Com-
munist Party, is an adversary. No 
amount of cajoling or diplomacy is 
going to get them to drop their hege-
monic ambitions. They want to be the 
top dog.

Second, the legislation must not in-
clude 
irrelevant 
pet 
projects 
like 
money for the U.N. climate slush fund. 
Third, at a bare minimum, we must 
ensure that any new technology or 
grant funding doesn’t end up going to 
China. A bill aimed at competing with 
the Chinese Communist Party that si-
multaneously 
funds 
their 
military 
modernization simply makes no sense. 
Mr. LUCAS’ motion to instruct would 
go a long way towards making sure 
that American tax dollars don’t go to 
fund the Chinese Communist Party. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
to support it. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan for her leadership, along with my 
colleague from Texas, Congresswoman 
JOHNSON, 
who 
chairs 
the 
Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee, and 
the many, many committees that have 
worked on the COMPETES Act. 
As an alum of the House Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee and 
a member of the Homeland Security 
Committee, I could not be more ec-
static for America, for Houstonians, for 
Texans. To really take the words of 
President Biden that were said to us in 
his comment on the COMPETES Act: 
It is transformational investment in 
our industrial base as well as research 
and development. It will help drive not 
only the American economy, but the 
global economy. It will, in fact, bring 
more manufacturing jobs back, and, 
yes, we will use the terminology, it 
will reimagine not only the Midwest, 
but it will reimagine the Southwest, 
the East, the West, the North, and the 
South. It will reimagine opportunities 
for young people. 
And the chips we have been waiting 
for, as indicated by the gentlewoman 
from Michigan, I know we will have the 
opportunity to really join in in a bipar-
tisan way in conference for something 
that nobody disagrees with. In addi-
tion, this ugly thing called the supply 
chain that for a moment clogged the 
system, raised the prices, which still 
have not been stabilized, but we will 
have the opportunity to address that 
question as well by unclogging the sea-
ways, by investing with the infrastruc-
ture bill in ports, and getting products 
where they need to go. 
Let me also suggest that we will be 
able to build other companies, smaller 
companies. Small businesses will im-
prove or be able to result in more in-
vestment. At the same time, this bipar-
tisan legislation will create opportuni-
ties for the next generation and the 
next generation. 
I hope as well that minority busi-
nesses, minority scientists, historically 
Black colleges will have the oppor-
tunity to be part of the COMPETES 
Act, which I know that they will. This 
idea that we have a distance between 
us as Republicans and Democrats has 
to be closed. 
This is an American bill. This is a 
bill to say to China: We are not going 
to take, sitting down, the unfair com-
petition that you exert on many of the 
inventions that actually are made 
right here in the United States. Take 
the age-old internet and what China 
has done in many instances. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support the 
COMPETES Act and it going to con-
ference, and at the same time recog-
nize that any issue dealing with China 
and the chips dealing with semiconduc-
tors will be addressed in conference, 
and, as well, we will get the job done. 
It is transformational and we can do no 
less than to invest in the great moun-
tain of research and development in 
this Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support the COMPETES Act ulti-
mately, and to work with conference as 
we go forward on this legislation. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the motion 
to instruct conferees. I welcome this 
opportunity 
to 
reconcile 
the 
dif-
ferences between the House and the 
Senate bills. This is an opportunity to 
finally hold China accountable, and I 
hope we get to a strong work product 
that we can be proud of. 
The House version of this bill, the 
COMPETES Act, truly is a nonstarter 
for House Republicans—no surprise— 
for both sides of the Senate as well, 
and actually for the American people— 
and that is my concern. 
While it was messaged as legislation 
to combat the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s predatory practices, the trade pro-
visions in the House bill did little to 
level the playing field with China, add-
ing hurdles that would hurt American 
consumers and small businesses. 
Instead, that bill actually discour-
ages work during a workforce shortage 
by expanding and delinking the trade 
adjustment assistance from new trade 
opportunities. It adds red tape and nar-
rows eligibility of trade programs like 
GSP and MTB. These are relief meas-
ures that we know help small busi-
nesses and manufacturers in the mar-
ketplace. The bill also exacerbates our 
supply chain crisis by making unvetted 
changes to de minimus; and it also fails 
to address the administration’s lack-
luster effort to compete with China in 
the Indo-Pacific and around the world. 
The Senate’s bipartisan approach, 
while imperfect, addresses China, pro-
motes small businesses of all sizes 
across our country, and more than any-
thing, it empowers American con-
sumers right here at home. 
b 1645 
It offers a clean renewal of MTB, 
retroactively extends GSP, mandates a 
section 301 exclusion process with 
retroactivity, and does not include the 
Green New Deal wish list. 
Let’s work together on a final prod-
uct that actually holds China account-
able. 
Madam Speaker, I reiterate my sup-
port and certainly urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time. I am pre-
pared to close, and I believe I have the 
right to close, so I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. 
We have heard today, Madam Speak-
er, a commitment to act, a commit-
ment to move into a conference, a com-
mitment to get the America COM-
PETES Act done for the United States, 
CHIPS Act funding, investment in sci-
entific research, and more. This is an 
exciting moment in this Chamber. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank my colleagues for their words 
of support for this motion. 
As I said when we began this debate, 
we have a once-in-a-generation chance 
to strengthen U.S. science and tech-
nology and secure a place in the global 
economy. The Science, Space, and 
Technology 
Committee 
has 
passed 
strategic, bipartisan legislation to do 
just that. Our bills double our invest-
ment in critical research and tech-
nology. They are a strong commitment 
to America’s technological develop-
ment. 
There is no question that our bills 
should 
be 
the 
core 
of 
the 
final 
conferenced legislation. We can’t afford 
to pollute these critical policies with 
partisan poison pills and throw away 
our deliberate, strategic approach for 
long-term growth in favor of the one- 
time spending spree in the COMPETES 
Act. 
There is a difference between empty 
spending and making an investment. 
The 
COMPETES 
Act 
is 
empty, 
unfocused 
spending. 
The 
Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee has 
passed 
targeted, 
bipartisan 
invest-
ments in research and technology. 
They will pay off in more jobs, a 
stronger economy, and a more secure 
homeland. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support that approach and 
to support guardrails to ensure that 
our taxpayer investments aren’t going 
to Communist leadership in China. 
That is why this motion is so impor-
tant. 
This isn’t a partisan issue. It has 
been part of Senator SCHUMER’s legisla-
tive text on competitiveness from day 
one. That is because this is basic, com-
monsense policy, and I can’t imagine 
that any of our constituents would dis-
agree with that. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to pass this motion, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Without objection, the previous ques-
tion is ordered.

RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TORRES of New York) laid before the 
House the following resignation from 
the House of Representatives: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, March 31, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I write to inform 
you that I have notified Texas Governor 
Greg Abbot of my resignation from the U.S. 
House of Representatives, effective today at 
11:59 PM EST. 
It has been a profound honor to represent 
the people of the 34th Congressional District 
of Texas for the last nine years, and my dis-
tinct pleasure to serve under your leader-
ship. 
Please let me know if I can be of assistance 
during this period of transition. 
Sincerely, 
FILEMON VELA, 
Member of Congress. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,

DEAR GOVERNOR ABBOTT: I write to inform 
you that I am resigning my position as the 
U.S. Representative for the 34th Congres-
sional District of Texas, effective today at 
11:59 PM EST. 
It has been a profound honor to represent

Please let me know how I can be of assist-
ance during this transition.

SUPPORTING CAP ON INSULIN 
PRICES 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support the Affordable Insulin 
Now Act. 
In America, a unit of insulin costs al-
most $100. I paid $348 for a vial. Across 
the border in Canada, it costs $12 for 
the same insulin. 
This 
enormous 
price 
difference 
causes diabetics to take drastic steps 
to survive. They ration their insulin to 
make it last. Some of them stop taking 
it for days to save money. These are 
life-threatening financial decisions. 
As a diabetic myself, I know the im-
portance of insulin to daily life. This 
boot on my foot is not a fashion choice. 
It is for a diabetic ulcer that I have 
been fighting for 8 months, and I have 
had seven in 10 years. I am one of the 
more than 37 million diabetics in 
America. 
If we can cap insulin payments to $35 
per month, it saves lives. That is why 
we need the Affordable Insulin Now 
Act. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
RICHARD ROY KELLEY, M.D. 
(Mr. CASE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate the life of Richard Roy 
Kelley, M.D., a true ‘‘keiki o ka aina,’’ 
‘‘a child of the land,’’ son of Hawaii, 
just lost to us at age 88. 
Doc Kelly was born to Hawaii’s origi-
nal hoteliers, Roy and Estelle Kelley, 
founders of Outrigger Hotels and Re-
sorts. He grew up in their Waikiki ho-
tels, graduated from Stanford and Har-
vard, and practiced in Honolulu before 
helming Outrigger through its second 
generation. 
On Doc’s watch, Outrigger expanded 
throughout Hawaii and the Pacific into 
a world-famous iconic beach resort 
brand; success for any life. 
But Doc Kelley did far more. He pio-
neered true cultural tourism in ‘‘Ke 
Ano Wa’a,’’ or ‘‘the Outrigger Way,’’ 
through which the entire lifeblood of 
each property embraces and embodies 
its special values and place. He led the 
World Travel and Tourism Council and 
advised our own Travel and Tourism 
Council. And he endlessly loved Hawaii 
and his ‘‘ ’ohana,’’ ‘‘family,’’ and never 
stopped giving back. 
Richard ‘‘Doc’’ Kelley, an amazing 
and unforgettable life. From all of us 
to you and yours, mahalo, and aloha. 
f 
CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM IS A 
DANGEROUS IDEOLOGY 
(Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend re-
marks.) 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to a dan-
gerous ideology threatening our de-
mocracy: White Christian nationalism. 
Most Members of Congress don’t even 
know what it means, but experts from 
the Freedom From Religion Founda-
tion and the Baptist Joint Committee 
for Religious Liberty have studied it 
for years, and their new report shows 
this movement was at the heart of the 
January 6 insurrection. 
White Christian nationalism fuses 
Christianity with a rigid view of civic 
life, a view that true Americans are 
White, native-born, and conservative. 
On January 6, it was the connective 
tissue that tied disparate groups to-
gether and propelled them to action. 
It is infecting our government, from 
Members of Congress and top officials 
in the previous administration to the 
wife of a Supreme Court Justice, whose 
messages to the President’s Chief of 
Staff leading up to the insurrection 
smacked of White Christian nation-
alism. 
Thankfully, good Americans, people 
of faith and nonbelievers, are standing 
up to this violent ideology. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on Members of 
Congress to educate themselves about 
White Christian nationalism and reaf-
firm the separation of church and 
State.

SUCCESS OF AMERICAN MANUFAC-
TURING HELPS WORKING FAMI-
LIES 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, from 
day one, House Democrats have been 
working with the Biden administration 
to build a stronger and more secure fu-
ture for the American people. That is 
why we recently passed the COM-
PETES Act to fix our national supply 
chains, 
boost 
competition, 
and 
strengthen U.S. manufacturing. 
Last week, I had the opportunity to 
visit Haas Automation in my district 
in Oxnard, California. Haas manufac-
tures over 90 percent of all American- 
made precision manufacturing tools 
and is the last standing major Amer-
ican manufacturer of the machines

that are essential to most manufac-
turing in America. 
We are working to ensure American 
manufacturing companies like Haas 
can continue to compete globally and 
continue to thrive. 
That includes ensuring a level play-
ing field with foreign competitors and 
ensuring U.S. manufacturers have ac-
cess to adequate supplies of essential 
semiconductor chips. 
That is why we must get the America 
COMPETES Act across the finish line, 
because the success of American manu-
facturing will lead to the success of 
American working families.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JACK 
LUMPKIN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
Georgia golfing legend, Jack Lumpkin. 
Jack was a master at the game of 
golf and a pillar of what Sea Island and 
Glynn County is today. When it came 
to the game, Jack was unparalleled in 
his understanding and knowledge. He 
spent his life coaching others and was 
recognized for his teaching ability nu-
merous times. 
In 1995, Jack was named PGA Na-
tional Teacher of the Year, and he was 
named a Top 50 Golf Teacher in Amer-
ica every year since 2000. 
I will always remember Jack teach-
ing students at the first tee box at the 
Golf Performance Center, which is now 
known as Lumpkin’s Tee. Jack would 
take his students to where the Golf 
Performance Center now stands be-
cause the area naturally blocked out 
the north wind coming from the ocean. 
It was Jack’s ideas, passion, and 
prowess that made this center possible. 
My prayers are with his family, 
friends, and the staff of Sea Island, as 
well as those that he mentored. 
f 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to mark the end of Women’s 
History Month and highlight the con-
tributions of women in my community: 
From education leaders like Joliet- 
native, Margaret Haley, a teacher who 
led the Chicago’s Teachers Federation 
to become the largest women’s union 
in the country by 1900; and 
Katharine Lucinda Sharp of Elgin, a 
founder of the Illinois Library Associa-
tion who ran the Midwest’s first li-
brary school; 
To entertainers like Plainfield-na-
tive, Melissa McCarthy, whose comedy 
has graced our screens for two decades; 
and 
Businesswomen, like Mary Foot Sey-
mour of Aurora, who founded the Busi-
ness Women’s Journal, a publishing 
company led entirely by women. 
These are just a few of the amazing 
women who have made a mark on my 
Northern Illinois community and our 
country, and I am proud to honor 
them. 
f 
AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to applaud the passage of the Af-
fordable Insulin Now Act and urge the 
other body to swiftly take up the bill. 
Millions of Americans depend upon 
insulin every single day, but too many 
are forced to ration or cut back on 
their other essential needs just to pay 
for the medication that keeps them 
alive. 
In Ohio, the cost of insulin can cost 
hundreds of dollars a month, and the 
pens that are used can cost between $45 
and $600. It is simply unaffordable. Cap-
ping the price of insulin at $35 a month 
means no longer will families have to 
choose between grocery and rent or 
their own lives. No longer should a dia-
betic be forced to ration out their in-
jections just to ensure they have 
enough until next month. 
Congress must act to pass the Afford-
able Insulin Now Act. Let’s save people 
real money, improve their lives, and af-
ford them the dignity that they de-
serve. 
f 
HORNET GIRLS ARE STATE 
BASKETBALL CHAMPIONS 
(Mr. LARSON of Connecticut asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, what a great honor for me to 
be here today and pay tribute to the 
fighting Hornets of East Hartford High. 
The girls’ team has won the State 
championship in the State of Con-
necticut for the first time in the 
school’s history. 
Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, Maureen 
Rodgers ushered in modern-day girls’ 
basketball 
at 
then-Penney 
High 
School. The crown today is that these 
young women demonstrated that vision 
and brought home the State champion-
ship to East Hartford, Connecticut. 
f 
REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN 
DON YOUNG 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to remember the dean of this 
House, Congressman Don Young, and to 
remember him from a perspective of 
far-reaching diversity and love of the 
institution. 
I offer my deepest sympathy to his 
wife, his family, his extended family, 
and all of the people of Alaska and all 
of the people of the Nation. 
Everyone who has offered a word of 
salute to Congressman Young empha-
sizes his 49 years, but most of all, his 
love of getting the job done—getting 
something done. 
And, of course, when I was having the 
privilege of being in the Chair, Mr. 
Speaker, I could always be reminded of 
that voice ‘‘regular order.’’ And often 
you wanted to just do what Don Young 
said: Regular order. Gavel it down. 
But, again, he did so because of a re-
spect for this institution. 
I thank him for all of the introduc-
tions to Alaska that he made and, real-
ly, all of the work for the Alaskan peo-
ple. No matter who they were, where 
they lived, in far reaches or inner cit-
ies, Don Young represented the State 
so ably. 
I am grateful to have spent just a 
small amount of time—two decades— 
with Don Young in the House. And he 
will be remembered, and we will be re-
minded of what love of the institution 
truly means; unselfish commitment, 
and the commitment to work and get 
the job done. 
Mr. Speaker, I salute the late Con-
gressman Don Young. I thank him for 
teaching us how to get the job done.

ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from West Vir-
ginia (Mr. MOONEY). 
PARTISAN GAMES—SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
THOMAS 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the latest par-
tisan games being pushed by the rad-
ical left is the call for Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse 
himself from certain cases or face im-
peachment. 
These demands stem from an email 
and other digital private communica-
tions of Justice Thomas’ wife to and 
from government officials at the time. 
If it becomes the standard that an 
elected official or a judge or a commis-
sioner or other government appointees 
can be attacked because of the views 
and political actions of a spouse, then 
everyone is fair game. 
How many members of the Demo-
cratic Caucus would like to be held ac-
countable for the politics or actions of 
their spouse? How many governors, 
State legislators, or judges at any level 
would be able to withstand an assault 
based on the beliefs of their husband or 
wife? No good will come of this effort. 
There are those who argue that the 
radical left wants such a toxic environ-
ment. The feeling is that those who

wish to radically transform America 
know that they are facing a harsh ver-
dict from the American people come 
this November. These activist par-
tisans are willing to literally throw our 
country into a frenzy of hate, sus-
picion, and personal vendetta in order 
to divert attention from the failure of 
their policies. 
I pray that the members of the 
Democratic Caucus making these ex-
tremist demands are ignored and that 
statesmen can take the lead. But if, 
once again, the Democrat leadership is 
so beholden to the extremist fringe 
that they send us into such a fight, you 
will not succeed. 
I thank the gentleman from Arizona 
for yielding me the time. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, to-
night is going to be a tricky presen-
tation, and I want to apologize imme-
diately to those who have to try take 
down our words. But tonight, I am 
going to actually try to focus on solu-
tions. 
Last week, I spent an hour behind 
this microphone begging our friends on 
the left, begging our Democrat col-
leagues to stop doing much of what 
they have been doing. And I dem-
onstrated that it has been hurting peo-
ple. Last year was miserable for the 
working poor, for the poor, for the mid-
dle class. 
And in some ways, it is our own fault 
in this body because intellectually, 
this place is calcified—that is my word 
of the day. Because we see the math. 
We see the facts. And we have the folks 
lay out what is going to happen. But 
because it is already part of, particu-
larly in this case, the left’s dogma, we 
do it anyway. And then we act sur-
prised here a year later when my com-
munity had 10.9 percent inflation last 
year. 
Year over year, how many people is 
that crushing? And now we are seeing 
some data. And this is important; this 
isn’t transitory. A number of the most 
powerful modelers in the economic 
world in this country are now starting 
to ring the alarm bells of both: We are 
heading towards a recession and that 
inflation may now be with us for dec-
ades because of how we have screwed 
things up in this place. 
First, this is as of almost today, you 
have Goldman Sachs now saying there 
is a 271⁄2 percent chance of a recession— 
not a slowdown, a recession, which 
means two quarters of negative GDP 
by the end of this year. 
Citi is at 25 percent. 
J.P. Morgan is still at 15, which were 
the numbers from last week. 
These numbers have skyrocketed. If 
you and I looked at this three weeks 
ago, it was 9 percent. 
Does anyone here actually care about 
people? Do you care about working 
men and women? Do you understand 
what a recession does to people? How 
long it takes to get your feet back un-
derneath you? Let alone the head kick 
we are giving to the American public 
with inflation. 
So here is my goal. I am going to 
race through just a boatload of slides 
here, and I am going to throw out con-
cept after concept after concept. Some 
of them are marginal. Some of them 
you are going to go, Oh, that makes 
sense. 
But the point is, there are actually 
solutions. If the left would ever allow 
us to offer a genuine amendment in 
committee, to actually have a genuine 
discussion and debate, maybe we could 
change some hearts and minds in this 
place, or just even enlighten some in-
tellect around here. But that isn’t what 
this place does. 
So let’s actually start to walk 
through the bill that a number of folks 
are so giddy about today. 
I am fixated on diabetes because of 
what it does and the misery to parts of 
my district. I represent a Tribal com-
munity that is number 2 as a percent-
age of population who suffer from dia-
betes. Come to the reservation. I will 
introduce you to families that I have 
known where mom has her feet cut off. 
But to tout the bill that was passed 
here today as a solution is an absolute 
fraud. You do realize the con job that 
the Democrats are touting here? And I 
am not sure it is purposeful. I don’t 
think they spent time understanding. 
First, you basically created a subsidy 
bill for Big Pharma. Congratulations. 
You didn’t reduce the price. What you 
did is you created, functionally, $20 bil-
lion of subsidy to buy down the price of 
insulin. And you bought it down with a 
fraud because you are doing a—well, we 
are going to pretend that the Trump 
administration’s rule in regard to re-
bates is in effect, which it was never 
going into effect. So you made magic 
money again. 
And at the same time, you just took 
away the pressure we could have done 
together to actually get a real solution 
on the price of insulin. And some of 
that solution could have been some-
thing as simple as the co-op that is in 
construction right now, that is saying 
they are going to bring $30 a vial, $55 a 
box—and a box is 5 vials—of insulin to 
market in a year. 
So if we were actually doing solu-
tions here, the Democrats’ bill, work-
ing with Republicans, would have been, 
We are going to put it in the stack for 
licensing and permitting. We are going 
to put aside some money to make sure 
that they get their factory up and run-
ning in Virginia as soon as possible. 
And, oh, by the way, this is substan-
tially less expensive than the sub-
sidized version that is going to cost so-
ciety $20 billion. And you are handing 
that to Big Pharma. Isn’t that amus-
ing? 
I mean, amusing the speechifying 
here. And the Democrats’ approach to 
helping people who can’t afford their 
insulin is to blow up the market, screw 
up the incentives, and then screw up 
the actual solution. And the solution is 
coming. 
Does anyone actually subscribe to 
something where they read? 
And you have got to understand, we 
need to go—and the whole debate 
around diabetes, we have got to go 
much, much further. 
Mr. Speaker, 31 percent of all Medi-
care spending is diabetes; 33 percent of 
all healthcare spending. Understand, in 
29 years, the United States is scheduled 
to have about $112 trillion of borrowed 
money in today’s dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, 75 percent of that is 
just Medicare, but if 31 percent of 
Medicare spending is diabetes, cure it. 
And you go, But, David, how would we 
do that? 
Well, I have been to this floor a dozen 
times over the last 12 months saying 
the research is happening. The early 
numbers look good. 
Guess what? It succeeded. Hey, the 
phase 1s worked. Now we are actually 
on another set of phase 1s where they 
are actually using CRISPR to tag the 
stem cell that has become an isolate 
cell to make it so you can do a bio-
foundry. And it could be a production 
line, so it doesn’t even need to come 
from your skin to get the stem cells. 
b 1815 
Meaning, if we would get our reim-
bursement sets straight here, our li-
censing sets straight here, our incen-
tives lined up. The modelers say in 
about 5 years you could actually be 
rolling out—the cure to type 1 is actu-
ally the easy part, it is the cure to type 
2 which is much more difficult. We 
have to have a brutal conversation of 
nutrition support and maybe nutrition 
support that is healthy. 
Encouraging our brothers and sisters 
in my Tribal communities, the life-
styles and things, to be ready to actu-
ally accept the cure. But the fact of the 
matter is it is here. So what did the 
Democrats just do? They did a subsidy 
bill for insulin that is going to cost $20 
billion. How about if they had taken 
that $20 billion and put it into the 
price for getting this cure to market? 
It is just an example we don’t seem 
to get our heads around. The world 
works in incentives and disincentives. 
We have made it so bureaucratic and so 
expensive that we are in an incumbent 
protection racket here. It is not incum-
bent Members of Congress, it is incum-
bent bureaucracies, incumbent busi-
ness models, and the disruptions like 
this that would end so much misery 
and also be the single biggest thing we 
can do to affect the debt in this coun-
try. 
We applaud ourselves for voting 
through a bill that actually will have 
made things worse. If there is an econ-
omist in the room and you walk 
through saying, well, because you just 
functionally 
government-subsidized 
this, you just took away the pricing 
pressure to actually have the revolu-
tion of both the cost and the cure. 
I am begging my brothers and sisters 
here to think. There is this incredible 
hope. They have already had the suc-
cesses in the phase ones, and now the 
ability to actually tag it and make it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4058 
March 31, 2022 
so you don’t need to be on anti-rejec-
tion drugs. Think about what it means 
to the health of the country. 
Why would I go to diabetes right 
after showing you that the projections 
of a recession at the end of this year 
are skyrocketing because you are head-
ing in an approach where you are mak-
ing a substantial portion of our popu-
lation—making them available to par-
ticipate in the economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to throw out 
a really uncomfortable subject for a 
second. I am the senior Republican on 
the Joint Economic Committee and we 
have been trying a little side project 
for almost a year. What makes people 
poor? What is the real cause of income 
inequality? And unlike the rhetorical 
crap virtue signaling that is said 
around here, we are actually starting 
to find out there are a lot of things, but 
health, education, things of that na-
ture that we can affect are actually 
major precursors, then you look at the 
amount of the population that is in the 
lower quartiles that either they or 
their family or because they have 
someone who is horribly sick substan-
tially because of renal failure or diabe-
tes. 
My other side of the argument is why 
this is moral to pursue. It also would 
end lots of misery. It would actually 
really help the poor. It actually might 
squeeze down income inequality. It is 
sort of the trifecta. Yet, I will do these 
presentations on how it works and that 
it would be amazing for economic 
growth, and if it truly brought more of 
our brothers and sisters to be able to 
participate in the economy, it would 
also be really good for inflation, too. 
I have done this slide multiple times. 
I’m trying to sort of explain the mech-
anisms of a stem cell and you can now 
direct—think of it as a biofoundry 
mechanism, sort of like CRISPR. You 
can direct that stem cell to become an 
insulin-producing cell. In the previous 
slide you can walk through how you 
can actually do this in a fashion that it 
can be almost a factory production. So 
even beyond the personalized medicine 
concept. 
Why this is so important is we are on 
the cusp of a revolution to make peo-
ple’s lives so much better—so much 
healthier. Instead, what we have done 
in this place over the last 12 months is 
we have set off inflation. We have set 
off crime. We have set off homelessness 
because of really, really bad policies. 
Lots of great virtue signaling. There 
have been beautiful speeches behind 
these microphones telling you how 
much we care and how we feel, and 
then the economics are just horrible. 
Some more of the disruption that I 
believe would be great for the coun-
try—and the technology is already 
here, we just have to learn how to le-
galize it—is your ability to wear some-
thing on your wrist. This is one of my 
favorites. I am just going to walk you 
through a concept. 
This is a breath biopsy. A couple 
versions of this out there think it 
would be a couple hundred dollars, at 
most, and you could have functionally 
a medical lab in your medicine cabinet 
at home. Blow into it. Within a couple 
moments it tells you: Hey, guess what, 
you have a virus. It can then bang off 
your 
medical 
records, 
order 
your 
antivirals, and maybe Lyft or someone 
can drop it off at your house in a cou-
ple hours. 
Would that make your life easier? 
Would that give you more time with 
your family and faster to get healed? 
Would it help crash parts of healthcare 
costs? Remember, three-quarters of 
that $112 trillion is healthcare, it is 
Medicare. Healthcare is what is sub-
stantially bankrupting this country. 
Do you know what the problem with 
that technology is? It is illegal. The 
fact of the matter is you would let this 
breath biopsy be able to order your 
antivirals, allow the algorithm—and 
the data says the algorithm is more ac-
curate than those of us that are hu-
mans. I know that just hurt a bunch of 
people’s feelings. 
If you legalize the technology you 
could have a disruption in the price of 
healthcare. You could make this soci-
ety—our country—dramatically more 
efficient and give us more time with 
our families and be healthy. It would 
be an economic virtuous cycle and a 
healthy one. It would just require us 
around here to actually have to deal 
with the avalanche of lobbyists that 
hate this technology. As I said before, 
we are sort of calcified intellectually 
around here, aren’t we? 
Mr. Speaker, now I want to talk 
about the heresy that is in President 
Biden’s budget and the solutions. How 
many times have you gotten up here 
and seen the Speaker herself, multiple 
times—tax reform in 2017 was for the 
rich. No, it wasn’t. CBO—more reve-
nues came in. Corporate tax receipts 
leaped 75 percent after we reformed the 
tax code a couple years ago. 
The fact of the matter is—what we 
call receipts in Ways and Means, reve-
nues as most people would think of— 
coming into in government went up 
dramatically. Why that was so impor-
tant is that 2018 and 2019 were our most 
successful years in modern economic 
history of poor people getting less 
poor, the middle class doing better, in-
come inequality shrinking, food inse-
curity shrinking. 
Minority populations had the biggest 
movement ever in U.S. history in get-
ting less poor, getting wealthier. That 
income inequality gap shrank because 
we got the tax incentives correct. But 
because it was Republicans that did it, 
there is this running away from it—we 
have seen—great job, guys. Think 
about what has happened to this coun-
try in 1 year. 
You are poorer today than you were 
1 year ago. The fact of the matter is 
the setting off of inflation—God knows 
some of the other things that have 
gone on and we are going to touch on 
them—we are poorer today than we 
were 1 year ago. Yes, there was COVID. 
We stood behind these microphones a 
year ago and said, you don’t want to 
keep dumping money the way you are 
doing, you are going to set off infla-
tion. They told us to go jump in the 
lake. Congratulations, they did it. 
Now some of the economists are tell-
ing us a recession by the end of the 
year, oh, and maybe 10 years of an in-
flationary cycle before we can squeeze 
it out of the system. 
Once again, if you actually look at 
the charts, it was actually working 
women that exploded. This big of a 
movement here—I know this chart 
doesn’t express it—that type of steep 
curve increasing is remarkable. It is 
just remarkable in what happened after 
tax reform. 
It was actually working women, sub-
stantially those from minority popu-
lations, that had just remarkable in-
creases in income. They are the ones 
that also got crushed during the way 
we approached the pandemic. Anyone 
that tells you, oh, it was this huge 
give-away of money. 
Well, it is sort of amazing because it 
was the second and the third highest 
receipts or revenues in 2018 and 2019. 
You got to remember there was a little 
bit of a con in 2017 because the expens-
ing went in—you could expense in the 
last quarter before the tax reform. So 
the fourth quarter of 2017 you could 
begin expensing. So this actually had 
some of the economic growth effects 
pulled into the previous year—I know I 
am geeking out a bit—but it continued. 
One of the reasons we actually eco-
nomically held up pretty well is the 
Democrats haven’t been able to repeal 
the 2017 tax reform. And I know this 
slide is a little hard to see, but it is the 
best one we could put together in the 
short 
timeframe. 
Guess 
what? 
We 
crossed over $4 trillion in revenues and 
receipts. 
If you go back—think about that, it 
was only a couple years earlier that we 
were at $3.3 trillion. You understand, 
that is like a $700 billion increase in re-
ceipts in a time when the Democrats 
told us we had eviscerated the tax code 
and gave it all away. At some point the 
calculator does tell the truth. 
So back to our earlier thesis. Getting 
the tax system correct is amazing for 
the economics. This is the other side of 
the question I want to ask. How many 
here believe growth is moral? I will try 
to argue over and over that economic 
growth creates opportunity, and those 
opportunities driven by that growth is 
moral. I wish I could just get us to 
focus on—that growth also is a way we 
survive the debt bubble that is expand-
ing like an alligator mouth. Here is the 
size of our economy and here is the 
scale of the debt. 
You do understand that CBO basi-
cally says in 9 years, every single year 
just our interest payment will be $1 
trillion. That is where we are heading. 
Here is a crazy thought. If I needed to 
tap down inflation today but I wanted 
to do it by not solely having the Fed-
eral Reserve do monetary policy, which

is squeezing cash out of the system— 
remember, inflation is what, too many 
dollars chasing too few goods. You 
have the monetary side of inflation 
pull the dollars out of the economy. 
The other side is to make more stuff. 
This year, expensing. The reality of 
it—tax reform—it was the expensing 
that drove much of the economic ex-
pansion, the investment in produc-
tivity, it goes to 80 percent this fiscal 
year and then drops down I think to 60 
percent the next year. Do a mechanism 
where you add a bonus. 
If you say: Business, if you are will-
ing to take some of that cash func-
tioning out of the system and go invest 
it in productivity capital, buy a new 
plant, put in new equipment, do things 
that will make it so you can pay work-
ers more. We make more stuff because 
when we have more stuff you knock 
down inflation because it is now the 
number of dollars divided by numbers 
of stuff. Crazy idea. 
b 1830 
Do a tax adjustment. 
Mr. Speaker, say we are going to give 
you a bonus on your expenses to en-
courage you to take that money out of 
liquidity and buy things that make us 
more productive as a country. It is a 
win-win, and it has the benefit of being 
a long-term benefit to society. 
It is sort of. We have been working 
on this. This is just as a thought exper-
iment. And it may not be brilliant, but 
it is more the concept of right now. 
Today there are too many dollars chas-
ing too few goods. Then create a deal 
with business in America saying, Hey, 
if you take some cash, set it aside, 
functionally, ah, screw it, and you are 
going to put it into new equipment 
that makes it more efficient so you can 
have more goods, better transpor-
tation, better supply chains, that is 
what we want to incentivize instead of 
trying to buy things today and shove 
them in a warehouse because you are 
worried the price is going to go up to-
morrow. 
This is the type of thought experi-
ments policy we should be pursuing, 
Mr. Speaker, if you need to knock 
down inflation but you want to do it by 
growing as an economy. 
Instead, around here, we are going to 
sit around on our backsides and let the 
Federal Reserve basically squeeze us 
out and put many people through 
months and months and months of re-
cessionary misery because that is how 
we are going to knock down inflation. 
Another part of the thought experi-
ment: I have some new areas—if I am 
blessed enough to represent in the com-
ing cycle—and we did some polling. 
And they came back that crime is their 
number one issue. 
I went on a ride-along with a ser-
geant who is actually a friend. He was 
showing me neighborhoods saying, You 
do realize the homelessness in these 
neighborhoods has doubled in a year. 
Doubled. He is explaining to me that 
someone now can get high for a frac-
tion of the cost they could a year ago. 
Every single one of those are what we 
call knockoff effects, second-degree, 
third-degree effects. 
Do you all remember your high 
school economics class? 
You opened up the borders. What did 
you think was going to happen? 
My community of Phoenix is flooded 
with narcotics. As a matter of fact, we 
just had a bust a couple months ago. 
There was enough fentanyl to kill 
every single resident in Arizona. 
So the compassion that this adminis-
tration and Speaker PELOSI wanted to 
show for the border, thank you, be-
cause you are killing my neighbors. 
The homelessness—I don’t believe the 
Phoenix market is the only area that is 
seeing incredible increases in home-
lessness. The crime—go on to the city 
of Phoenix’s heat map and click, click, 
click, and you can see the expansion of 
the crime and where it is moving and 
the number of overdoses. 
The fact of the matter is when you 
screw up a policy, then you need to 
think through the knockoff effects. 
You screwed up the border policy. 
How much misery did you bring to 
society? 
Remember, we have done a number of 
presentations. 
What are the two ways you make the 
working middle class or the working 
lower class poorer? 
Inflation. We are doing a great job at 
that. And you flood the marketplace 
with people with similar skill sets. So 
if you are that individual who may not 
have finished high school, but you are 
a good drywaller and you are busting 
your backside—and it is hard work; I 
hung drywall as a young man—we just 
flooded the marketplace with people of 
similar skill sets. 
Does anyone around here own a basic 
economics book? 
So let’s go to a couple other things. 
So the principle there is, get the border 
policy right because there is this in-
credible irony—legal immigration for 
individuals with specific talent sets 
that we actually need in this society, 
the young man who just got his Ph.D. 
at Arizona State University and is 
leaving because the State Depart-
ment’s ability to process visas and 
ability to be immigration has function-
ally become nonexistent in the last 2 
years. But over here, a couple million 
cross the border. 
Does anyone see just the weird irony 
of the Democrats’ policies of, they 
hurt? 
I don’t think they were meant to 
hurt. I think they had the virtue sig-
naling quality of sounding compas-
sionate, but that is not what has hap-
pened. 
So let’s actually walk through a cou-
ple of things that are actually addi-
tional solutions. 
How many times do we talk about 
supply chains? 
And you have seen the latest data. It 
basically says—and I am not going to 
argue with it because I haven’t had a 
chance to break down the numbers— 
half of inflation is we spent too damn 
much money. But half of inflation is 
second degree knockoff effects in sup-
ply chains. 
So we just did the transportation 
bill. The transportation bill was sub-
stantially green oriented, very little of 
the money actually went to roads and 
bridges. None of it actually went to 
disruptive technologies. 
But there are ideas like this, where 
this was some SpaceX engineers who 
are out raising capital to build this, 
where you would actually have autono-
mous trains. So you pull a container 
off, stick it on one of these, the auton-
omous lorry right underneath it on the 
track drives it to the warehouse it is 
supposed to be dropped off at. 
So you are telling me we have a cri-
sis in truck drivers in the Alameda 
Corridor outside L.A. Our ability to use 
technology, why didn’t we incentivize 
this sort of thing? 
But do you want to know what the 
Democrats chose to incentivize in their 
Build Back Better, Mr. Speaker? 
It wasn’t creative things to make us 
more productive as a society. It was 
ideas like this: in their legislation it is 
illegal for the ports to automate. 
Huh? 
But they just told us that they were 
trying to fix the supply chains—except 
for the numbers of giveaways to the 
unions they put into their legislation 
that you can’t automate the ports. 
So on one hand, Mr. Speaker, you 
have breakthrough technology that 
says that we think we have a way to 
move these containers. And then the 
next thing that the brain trust around 
here does policy-wise is, we are going 
to make it illegal for you to do the au-
tomation that would move the supply 
chains that you are telling us is half 
the inflationary spike. 
There are solutions. Stop putting up 
these impediments and start embracing 
the technology to fix the problem. 
Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much 
time I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona has 29 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. So in the Presi-
dent’s proposal, in the Democrats’ pro-
posals, they want to tax the rich more. 
The new President Biden’s budget, I 
think, has 36 new taxes in it. But here 
is the great irony. Okay. So they want 
to do this one tax where they want to 
functionally tax unrealized capital or 
unrealized gains which is the taking— 
it will be ruled unconstitutional. But it 
is an interesting concept. We want to 
make a simple proposal that something 
both Republicans and Democrats might 
agree upon, stop subsidizing the rich. 
We have come here to this floor a cou-
ple of times and shown there are $1.4 
trillion every 10 years that the left sub-
sidizes the rich. 
And so what do the Democrats do? 
They say: We need to tax the rich 
more. 
Okay. And then they put in Build 
Back Better you can make $800,000 a

year and we are going to hand you 
$125,000 of tax credits—not tax deduc-
tions—credits. 
Does anyone see the lunacy going on 
here? 
So the virtue signaling is rich people 
aren’t paying enough, and then over 
here we are going to give them 1 tril-
lion-plus dollars in subsidies, and then 
they are going to add more in their 
Build Back Better for more rich people 
to have more subsidies. It is just infuri-
ating. 
Does anyone actually read this stuff? 
Does anyone own a calculator? 
Mr. Speaker, you start to see the 
numbers. 
I have a number of these slides here, 
and the point is really simple: policy 
after policy, if you can afford your 
fourth $6-million house on a beach 
somewhere, do you deserve subsidized 
flood insurance? 
But all through this government 
there are items like that where we 
wink and nod, we say we are going to 
tax rich people more, and then we are 
handing out massive subsidies. 
As a Republican, I want to cut spend-
ing. You say you want more revenues, 
Mr. 
Speaker. 
Great. 
Stop 
putting 
through the Tax Code, regulatory code, 
these programs of wink, wink, nod, 
nod, a bunch of subsidies to people who 
write checks. 
So, Mr. Speaker, you have had a 
number of, particularly, Republicans 
who have come behind the microphone 
and said: You canceled the Keystone 
pipeline. You made it really hard to 
put new land into production for pull-
ing hydrocarbons out. 
That is actually not the big thing 
that the left did. What the left did are 
things like this where the Securities 
and Exchange Commission is function-
ally adding new rules that if you invest 
in hydrocarbons or you are a pension 
system or these, you are going to have 
to fill out paperwork to explain your 
effect on global warming. 
What are your effects on carbon? 
They functionally did what we call, 
they screwed up the capital stack. So 
you could have a natural gas field that 
was substantially shut down when 
prices collapsed during the pandemic. 
It is ready to go, but you need a bunch 
of capital to put it back into produc-
tion. 
And where do you go to get a loan, 
Mr. Speaker? 
The Democrats did something bril-
liant, if the goal was to make us much 
poorer and dependent on foreign coun-
tries’ hydrocarbons like Venezuela. 
They said, Okay. We can do the regu-
latory side, by that is a little bit obvi-
ous, but if we make it so no one can get 
capital to actually put these fields into 
production, they have succeeded. 
Do not let someone try to con you, 
Mr. Speaker, that what you are paying 
at the gas pump today and what you 
had to pay for your heating bill yester-
day happened because of Putin’s inva-
sion. Natural gas prices exploded last 
September, October. 
Mr. Speaker, do you remember this 
room being full of people wanting to 
talk about how we are going to survive 
the winter heating bills? 
That was because if this. It didn’t 
just happen. 
But my proposal is, okay. I am fas-
cinated with the use of natural gas. 
Our friends on the left, our brothers 
and sisters on the left, say, But, David, 
yes, it may burn about half the CO 2 
emitting as coal, but there is methane. 
Let’s see if I can find this slide. The 
technology that is out there to basi-
cally gobble up methane—and maybe 
this works, maybe it doesn’t work, but 
the fact that the technology exists and 
it has been scientifically proven to 
work, why wouldn’t we pursue that 
saying: If you could get your natural 
gas out—because remember, President 
Biden just promised we are going to 
ship a bunch of liquified natural gas to 
Europe, except we don’t really have the 
production right now and you can’t get 
capital for it and the left is going to 
protest leakage from methane. Well, it 
turns out you can take clay, a copper 
oxide—so it is kitty litter. Think about 
that. It is a cheap solution to absorb 
that methane. 
Why wouldn’t we bring the brain 
trusts around here and say, We need 
the natural gas desperately. Some are 
worried about the methane bleed. Fine. 
Let’s find a solution. It turns out there 
may be a really inexpensive one. 
Why don’t we invest and pursue it? 
There are solutions. 
Instead, around here, it is the Mal-
thusian economics of let’s just shut it 
down and see how long people are will-
ing to live in poverty and misery. 
The transportation bill again: What 
is one of the most powerful things you 
can do to move traffic in urban areas 
and suburban areas, Mr. Speaker? 
Technology. It turns out if you actu-
ally care about the environment and 
you want to move more traffic, invest 
in the technology that synchronizes 
the stoplights that tell you when 
school is out, so it synchronizes the 
lights, the on-ramps to a freeway that 
tell you when an ambulance is coming. 
The studies over and over and over say 
whether it be in an algorithm or an AI- 
managed smart grid system for traffic 
is one of the most impactful things you 
can do, Mr. Speaker, to clean the air 
because you move the traffic. 
We couldn’t get anyone here willing 
to even listen to one of our amend-
ments on the left about promoting that 
type of technology. 
There is a biotech revolution going 
on around us and substantially this is 
happening because of what we did in 
that 2017 tax reform which moved—ex-
ploded—the investments. Whether it be 
messenger RNA, my fascination with 
synthetic biology, the stem cells, there 
are disease after disease after disease 
and misery after misery we are about 
to cure. We know how to cure hemo-
philia now. I think we are on the cusp 
of knowing how to cure sickle cell ane-
mia, an incredibly painful disease. 
They are here. 
This place should be doing every-
thing we can to promote getting those 
things to market safely and quickly, as 
fast as we can to end the misery. By 
the way, it has amazing financial bene-
fits to the economy and to our tax 
base. 
And you start to look at the innova-
tions that are coming right now from 
the biotech industry. 
b 1845 
One of the reasons I did this—and I 
didn’t bring the other slides. Then, the 
left offers their H.R. 3, which, function-
ally, the economists, even the leftwing 
economists, said, yes, it will lower 
some drug prices, because we are basi-
cally going to do scarcity pricing. 
Functionally, we are going to say you 
can’t have certain drugs if it costs 
more than a certain amount, like they 
do in Europe. But it will also crash the 
capital stock once again. A lot of you 
are going to die because you are not 
going to get this next generation of 
cure, and this amazing cycle of cures 
that are coming goes away—great vir-
tue signaling. 
The left will tell you they are about 
to do a piece of legislation to lower 
drug prices, and we all go ‘‘yay,’’ be-
cause they are too high. But by the end 
of the decade, there are fewer cures, 
and the value goes away because you 
didn’t remove people from being sick. 
It is all about curing people. In the 
misery, help bring those cures to mar-
ket. 
Personalized medicine, let’s legalize 
it. I showed you the wearables, those 
things. This here should be part of your 
ability to stay healthy. Legalize it. 
Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much 
time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 19 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Forgive me. I 
have been trying to talk fast so as to 
not chew it all up. 
Mr. Speaker, in a couple of the pieces 
of legislation that passed here, we have 
put aside boatloads of cash to run wire 
to rural America, and they deserve to 
have internet access. 
I thought this slide was amusing, but 
you are actually seeing it happening in 
Ukraine right now. These are a bunch 
of little kitties in a Starlink satellite 
dish because apparently a Starlink sat-
ellite dish stays a bit warm in the win-
ter so it defrosts itself. See, it is cute— 
kitties. 
But the fact of the matter is, every 
inch 
of 
North 
America 
now 
has 
broadband internet. It is a bunch of 
satellites flying over us. 
So, let me get this straight: In 
Ukraine, they are now using this, 
Starlink, to be able to communicate, 
but we can’t seem to get our brothers 
and sisters here in the House of Rep-
resentatives to understand there is a 
solution to broadband all over the 
country. They just happen to be flying 
in low-Earth orbit above our heads. It 
is here. 
Instead, we are going to turn around 
and put out billions and billions and

billions and billions of dollars of sub-
sidies to put more fiber and more wire 
in the ground to the middle of nowhere. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a huge disrup-
tion coming. We need to make sure 
that our regulatory and policy sets are 
ready for this. 
This is another thing that would also 
dramatically help this coming decade’s 
inflation cycle. Researchers, particu-
larly at the University of Illinois, have 
done this remarkable thing. I did a se-
ries of presentations on this a year ago. 
I will do this real quick. 
You-all remember your high school 
biology class. You remember a C4 
plant, plants that really, really want 
carbon to turn it into a sugar and 
grow. But they accidentally grab an 
oxygen molecule, and they have to 
spend all of this energy purging that 
oxygen molecule and go back and try 
to get a carbon molecule. I know this is 
a little geeky, but it is important to 
get our heads around it. 
They have come up with a way to 
tweak the plant so, every time, it al-
ways grabs the carbon so it turns it 
into a sugar. Some plants will grow 40 
percent more efficiently on the same 
land, the same fertilizer, and the same 
water. You do realize, just that basic 
math—and it won’t turn out this way, 
but just conceptually—that is like re-
moving every car off the face of the 
Earth. 
If our brothers and sisters really care 
about the environment, they would be 
running as fast as they can to allow 
these types of available technologies to 
feed the world and feed our country. 
Yes, it would be a disruption, but these 
things exist. 
Mr. Speaker, the other topic I want 
to touch on is a tax policy. This is a 
conceptual one. 
How many of you have ever heard of 
a VAT tax, a value-added tax? Okay, so 
much for the enthusiasm. 
A value-added tax is what substan-
tially most of the rest of the world 
uses. If we are going to have a con-
versation about: We want businesses 
back in the United States; we want 
manufacturing back in the United 
States; we want to take on China; we 
are going to do tariffs; we are going to 
do these regulations; and we are going 
to do import and export controls— 
great. Realize most of those aren’t 
really going to do much. Here is how I 
am going to try to explain what the 
rest of the world does to stick it to the 
United States. 
This is a picture of a beautiful Audi. 
Let’s pretend it is a $100,000 car. My 
guess is, this one is a little more expen-
sive. It is being made in Germany, but 
someone in Scottsdale, Arizona, is 
about to buy this Audi. 
When it is in Germany, there is a 19 
percent VAT tax on it, a value-added 
tax. But the moment it leaves the 
shore of Germany and is on its way to 
the United States, the car has been ex-
ported. They give them back the 
$19,000, that 19 percent. When it comes 
to the United States, it is $19,000 less 
than it was sitting there in Germany. 
When it hits our shore, we put a small 
tariff or duty on it. 
But the $100,000 Tesla that is made in 
Texas, when someone in Germany is 
buying it, it has all the tax load—cor-
porate tax, income tax, all the other 
things that we would do in the United 
States—in that price. When this car 
leaves the United States, we don’t re-
fund 19 percent of the taxes. It hits the 
German shore, and they put that 
$19,000 on top of the price. 
So, we get it both ways, coming and 
going. When we want to export, other 
countries put their VAT tax on our 
products. But when they send a product 
to us, they take it off. 
We can be incredibly competitive. We 
can automate in ways to make up for 
labor differential costs. Our energy 
costs are actually much more competi-
tive than the rest of the world. 
Why isn’t all manufacturing in the 
United States right now? It is because 
we are basically getting arbitraged on 
the value-added tax because the rest of 
the world refunds it. Until we fix that, 
all the talk of ‘‘we want made in Amer-
ica,’’ the math doesn’t work. 
There are a couple of creative solu-
tions. They are technically difficult, 
where you would have to take that re-
funded VAT and put it back on at our 
shore, so, functionally, everyone is 
treated exactly the same. The $100,000 
American-made car and the $100,000 
German-made car have the same tax 
load when they are being sold in their 
respective countries. 
I have been trying to figure out a 
way to try to explain this concept sim-
ply, but the tax system, the current 
tax system as it is, is one of the rea-
sons it is so difficult to compete with 
other countries’ manufacturing, be-
cause they refund that value-added tax. 
Mr. Speaker, the last thing is, I am 
truly worried about something. I be-
lieve it is going to affect the United 
States, but I fear it is going to affect 
the entire world. 
How many of you have seen the sto-
ries that a number of the agrarian 
economists, food economists, believe 
that this coming fall, parts of the 
world are going to starve? 
The price of fertilizer is up dramati-
cally. The price of grain is up dramati-
cally. Putin’s war on Ukraine has 
screwed up the grain markets. 
Do we have a moral obligation to 
step up and understand that, 6 months 
from now, part of the world may be 
starving? What happens in the world 
when you have people going hungry? 
You have violence and horrible things 
happening. 
We see it coming. All the things we 
are seeing in the futures markets, the 
price of fertilizer blowing up, if they 
don’t actually affect food supplies, if I 
am wrong, it is a free option. But if I 
am right, we should be pulling the 
alarm cord. 
We should be begging farmers—in our 
farm policy, our ag committee, we 
should be removing set-asides, encour-
aging ways to take corn that would be 
used to make corn-based ethanol and 
turn it into animal feed, using the ro-
tation that is already happening to soy 
because soy only uses—it is not my 
specialty—a quarter or a third of the 
amount of fertilizer. 
If this is about to happen to the 
world, and we see it 6 months ahead, 
what is our moral obligation to pull 
that alarm cord and get it right? By 
getting it right, we also help our own 
inflation and maybe a couple of million 
people don’t die in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Mr. Speaker, I know that was a lot of 
different subjects thrown really quick-
ly. If someone is interested, almost ev-
erything I touched on, we have done 
much longer presentations on how the 
policy would work, how it would help 
inflation, how it would make people’s 
lives healthier and better. 
But my point tonight is a really sim-
ple one. Stop doing the things that ul-
timately are hurting people. Start 
looking for the optimism and the op-
portunity that can make America more 
prosperous, that can make the poor 
less poor, and that can actually knock 
down inflation. It would actually be 
able to be done together. 
A lot of these ideas aren’t actually 
Republican or Democrat. They are just 
disruptive. If we would embrace the 
disruption, this could be an amazing 
decade. Right now, the data we are get-
ting today, we may be in for years of 
misery because of policy from this last 
year. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
RENAMING THE RUSSELL SENATE 
OFFICE BUILDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. Mr. Speaker, and still I 
rise. And I rise as a proud Member of 
this august body. 
I rise with gratitude for the time 
that I have been afforded. I rise, under-
standing that time is precious. And I 
rise understanding that tonight, I have 
a topic that is going to be of interest to 
many and provocative to some, but 
still I rise. 
I rise with the topic of institutional-
ized racism emanating from Capitol 
Hill. 
Institutionalized 
racism 
ema-
nating from Capitol Hill. 
This is hardly where one would ex-
pect 
institutionalized 
racism. 
And 
there are a good many people who say 
there is no such thing as institutional-
ized racism. 
I trust that after tonight’s message, 
many minds will be changed, and per-
haps some hearts will be changed be-
cause if you know the truth, it can set 
you free. It can free your heart, it can 
free your mind, it can free your body, 
and it can free your soul.

March 31, 2022 
So let’s take the acts of truth to-
night and slam it into the tree of cir-
cumstance and let the chips fall where 
they must. And still I rise. 
Mr. Speaker, it is said that a picture 
is worth a thousand words. A picture is 
worth a thousand words. Here is a pic-
ture. This is a picture of the Russell 
Senate Office Building. The Russell 
Senate Office Building. 
I think it appropriate that we get a 
better understanding of who Russell 
was. In 1972, some 50 years ago, the Old 
Senate Office Building, that would be 
this building, was named after Senator 
Richard 
Brevard 
Russell, 
Jr., 
an 
unapologetic racist, a white suprema-
cist. 
He was the chief legislative architect 
of the South’s bitter opposition to the 
civil rights. He claimed that America 
was a White man’s country. And he 
said: 
And we are going to keep it that way. 
Richard Brevard Russell, Jr., a Sen-
ator. 
During his first run for the State leg-
islature in 1920, he solicited the sup-
port and influence of every White voter 
and pledged he would serve only them, 
he would serve only them, if elected. 
Russell said while campaigning in 
1936: 
As one who was born and reared in the at-
mosphere of the old South, with six genera-
tions of my forebearers now resting beneath 
southern soil, I am willing to go as far and 
make as great a sacrifice to preserve and en-
sure white supremacy and the social, eco-
nomic, and political life of our State as any 
man who lives within her borders. 
These are the words of Richard Rus-
sell, Senator Richard Russell. Senator 
Richard Russell whose name is on the 
Russell Senate Office Building, a build-
ing maintained with tax dollars. A 
building constructed with tax dollars. 
A building that I have to go into from 
time to time. 
I try to limit my traversing through 
the building, but from time to time I 
must. But at some point, I am going to 
limit all of my movement into the 
building. I won’t be going into it at 
some point. 
And at some point, people of African 
ancestry are not going to go into this 
building. It is a symbol of national 
shame, not national pride. A symbol of 
national shame. The Russell Senate Of-
fice Building. 
Senator Richard Russell successfully 
filibustered anti-lynching bills. We just 
passed an anti-lynching bill after many 
decades. One of the reasons why it took 
so long is because of Senator Richard 
Russell. 
He blocked bills to eliminate poll 
taxes. He stood in the way of voting 
rights, especially for people of color. 
He also blocked bills to desegregate 
public schools, and this was done after 
Brown v. Board of Education. 
He co-authored the ‘‘Southern Mani-
festo’’ to slow the integration of public 
schools after the Supreme Court unani-
mously ordered in its Brown case that 
schools would be desegregated with all 
deliberate speed. Senator Richard Rus-
sell. Russell Senate Office Building. 
Senator Russell proclaimed: 
There is no such thing as a little integra-
tion. 
This is what he said in 1957, he said: 
They, meaning Black people, are deter-
mined to get into our White schools, and 
into White restaurants, and into White 
swimming pools. 
He went on and indicated that he 
would warn his Senate colleagues that 
this would mean a mongrel race which 
would result in destroying America. 
Senator Richard Russell. A Senate of-
fice building named in honor of Sen-
ator Richard Russell. 
He proposed a voluntary racial relo-
cation program to adjust the imbal-
ance of the Negro population between 
the South and the rest of the country, 
literally proposed moving Black people 
to some other States because there 
were too many in the South. Senator 
Richard Russell. The Russell Senate 
Office Building. 
When President Truman fought to 
end segregation in the military, Rus-
sell responded with vile, racial libels. 
Here is what he stated, Senator Rich-
ard Russell, these are his words: 
The incidence of syphilis, gonorrhea, chan-
cre, and other venereal diseases is appall-
ingly higher among members of the Negro 
race. 
One would say that by this standard, 
all of us have been maligned, those of 
us who are members of the Negro race, 
as he called it. 
He declared: 
And allowing Black and White troops to 
serve together is sure to increase the num-
bers of men who will be disabled through 
communicable diseases. 
The words of Senator Richard Rus-
sell. 
Yes, the Senate Russell Office Build-
ing is named after a self-proclaimed 
white supremacist. It is a symbol of na-
tional shame. 
On March 30, 1964, the Southern Bloc 
of 18 Democratic Senators and one Re-
publican Senator, led by Senator Rich-
ard Russell, launched a filibuster to 
prevent the passage of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act, stood in the way of what 
we now consider some of the great leg-
islative actions that were taken up by 
the House and the Senate. 
Senator Russell proclaimed: 
We will resist to the bitter end any meas-
ure or any movement which would tend to 
bring about social equality—some things 
bear repeating—we will resist to the bitter 
end any measure or any movement which 
would tend to bring about social equality 
and intermingling and amalgamation of the 
races in our States. 
He voted against the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act which he called short-sighted and 
disastrous. He added that the civil 
rights bill’s true intended effect was to 
intermingle races, eliminate States’ 
rights, and abolish the checks and bal-
ance system. 
A great President from the State of 
Texas, the Honorable President Lyndon 
B. Johnson, signed the Civil Rights Act 
into law. And, as a result, Senator 
Richard Russell led a southern boycott 
of the 1964 Democratic National Con-
vention. 
I would that many who contend that 
there is no institutionalized racism 
could walk in the shoes of those of us 
who face it, who understand that for 
us, racism is more than a word. 
It can sometimes be a way of life 
that you have to contend with, even 
into 2022. The Russell Senate Office 
Building. 
You think I get great pleasure walk-
ing through a building named after a 
person who proclaimed himself a white 
supremacist? I get no great pleasure in 
moving through the facility. 
And I find this to be very interesting. 
What the Senate does—the Senate 
named it. It was the Old Senate Office 
Building. What the Senate does, the 
Senate can undo. 
This building does not have to bear 
the name of a white supremacist. This 
can be changed. We but only have to 
have the will to do it. 
And, unfortunately, too many of us 
find ourselves having to deal with our 
concerns of this nature siloed. Siloed. 
Well, this concerns Black people, and 
as a result, Black people ought to solve 
this problem. 
That is not the approach that I have 
taken. Long before I came to Congress, 
I thought that and still believe that if 
invidious discrimination exists against 
anyone, it is everyone’s duty, responsi-
bility, and, indeed, an obligation to 
challenge it. Not for myself, but for hu-
manity. 
And there are times when, in so 
doing, you have to stand alone. But I 
sincerely believe in the inner sanctum 
of my soul that it is better to stand 
alone than not stand at all. 
So I stand here tonight acknowl-
edging that on many occasions when it 
has come to the rights of others, check 
my voting record. Check my voting 
record. Where were you, AL
GREEN, 
when we took up the rights of the 
LGBTQ community? I was there. 
Where were you when we took up the 
rights of the Latino community? I was 
there. Babies at the borders. 
Where were you when we took up the 
rights of the Jewish community, those 
standing up against those who are anti- 
Semitic? I was there. 
So I ask tonight: Where are we, 
friends, on the Russell Senate Office 
Building that, to this day, honors a 
self-proclaimed white supremacist? 
This is institutionalized. It is institu-
tionalized because the Congress, by and 
through the Senate as an institution, 
made it so. 
You want to see institutionalized 
racism? A picture is worth a thousand 
words. There it is. That is it. The Rus-
sell Senate Office Building. All people 
of good will ought to want to see this 
changed. 
I am not the first person, by the way, 
to say that it should be changed. I may 
be one of many, but as long as I am 
here, I am going to be fighting to

change the name of the Russell Senate 
Office Building. 
Institutionalized racism. A picture of 
it, worth a thousand words. Emanating 
from Capitol Hill, a place where we 
passed civil rights laws, a place where 
we stand, one would assume, against 
all forms of invidious discrimination. 
No one would have a building on Cap-
itol Hill bear the name of a self-pro-
claimed white supremacist, but there it 
is. The Russell Senate Office Building. 
Now, friends, I have not said what we 
should name the building after the 
name Senator Richard Russell is re-
moved. I have not said that we should 
name it after any given person. I have 
not said that we should have a certain 
process in place to select the name. 
I have said let it revert to the name 
that was there before we named it after 
a self-proclaimed white supremacist. 
Let it revert to what it was before, and 
that was the Old Senate Office Build-
ing. 
Let it revert and then establish the 
proper protocols and all of the proc-
esses and whatever methodology you 
choose to select the name. 
I believe that we won’t make that 
mistake again, the mistake that we 
made with Senator Richard Russell, 
but let’s let it revert, and that, we 
could do overnight. That, we could do 
overnight. 
There is no requirement that we wait 
months, years, weeks. No requirement. 
We could change the name to the Old 
Senate Office Building overnight. We 
would only have to have the will to do 
it and believe that in so doing, it won’t 
look like someone made us do it. 
You know, that always enters into 
politics it seems. I shouldn’t say al-
ways. Too often, we don’t do things be-
cause we don’t want it to seem as 
though someone made us do it. We 
have to find our own way to get it 
done. 
We have to allow the parade to turn 
the corner and then run out in front of 
it and claim that we were there all the 
time. 
Do whatever you must, but let’s take 
the name off. Let’s take Richard Rus-
sell’s name off of the building. 
b 1915 
Friends, if a picture is worth a thou-
sand words, I contend that a song 
speaks for itself and its writer. A song 
speaks for itself and its writer. Let’s 
now move on from the Russell Senate 
Office Building, and let’s move on to 
Stephen Foster. Stephen Foster. 
Stephen Foster has a memorial day. 
Stephen Foster Memorial Day in the 
United States is a Federal observance 
day, and we do observe Stephen Foster 
Day on January 13 annually. Stephen 
Foster Memorial Day. 
Who, pray tell, was Stephen Foster? 
Well, let’s talk about Mr. Foster and 
some of the lyrics in some of his songs. 
Not all of his songs, but too many of 
his songs contained lyrics that are of-
fensive to people of color. 
Before we examine the lyrics, let’s do 
this. Let’s just explain that you don’t 
get a day in your honor without the 
consent of the House and the Senate 
and the President of the United States 
of America. You don’t get a day in 
your honor without voting. People 
have to vote. The President has to sign 
an order. 
I will be reading for you the resolu-
tion in just a moment, but for now let’s 
look at some of the songs, songs by 
Stephen C. Foster. Stephen C. Foster. 
Songs by Stephen C. Foster containing 
the n-word. Some of you may be famil-
iar with ‘‘Oh! Susanna.’’ 
‘‘Oh! Susanna.’’ I trust at home that 
you can read this. He uses what I con-
sider a demeaning vernacular. 
I jump’d aboard the telegraph and 
trabbled down de ribber, 
De lectrick fluid magnified, and kill’d 
500 n-words. 
We are not allowed to say the word 
on the floor, and I appreciate that. I 
never say it. I am not one of those per-
sons who—in my private life I don’t use 
that word. Song by Stephen C. Foster. 
Stephen C. Foster, by the way, was 
declared 
the 
Father 
of 
American 
Music. The Father of American Music. 
The date that we commemorate or cel-
ebrate, however you choose, is January 
13 annually. The date was created by 
H.J. Res. 308, 82nd Congress, introduced 
in the House on August 2, 1951, passed 
the House on October 15, 1951, some 74 
days after introduction. But 74 days 
after its introduction, it passed the 
House. It passed the Senate on October 
19, 1951, some 78 days after introduc-
tion, and was signed into law by the 
President of the United States on Octo-
ber 27, 1951, some 86 days after intro-
duction. 
One can only but pray that legisla-
tion, righteous legislation that benefits 
people who have been demeaned, people 
who have been discriminated against, 
righteous legislation that would ben-
efit them and prevent future discrimi-
nation, righteous legislation, would 
only pray that we could get such 
timelines for righteous legislation. 
Stephen 
Foster 
performed 
in 
blackface. For those who are not famil-
iar—and by the way, he started this at 
the age of 9, so he was influenced— 
blackface, this is a form of art—and I 
am being kind—wherein persons who 
are of European ancestry paint their 
faces black, and in a sense they per-
petrate a vision of Black people as 
happy-go-lucky 
dancers, 
jumping 
around, simple and good-natured crea-
tures in minstrel shows. 
Minstrel shows were a form of racist 
entertainment developed in the early 
19th century consisting of comic skits, 
variety acts, dancing, and music per-
formances that depicted people specifi-
cally of African descent. The shows 
were performed by mostly White people 
in makeup, or blackface as I have ex-
plained, for the purpose of playing the 
role of Black people. Minstrel shows 
lampooned Black people as dimwitted, 
lazy, 
buffoonish, 
superstitious, 
and 
happy-go-lucky. Stephen Foster was a 
master of minstrel music. 
Christy’s Minstrels, the most suc-
cessful minstrel shows of the time, 
made an arrangement with Foster for 
the show to be the first to sing his 
songs. Mr. Foster, if you have a song, a 
minstrel song, we want to be the first. 
I can imagine Mr. Christy saying that. 
He would have the rights to be the first 
to sing these songs, present these plays 
demeaning Black people. And Mr. Fos-
ter complied. 
Before I read the resolution, let’s 
take a look at another song, another 
song written by the Father of Amer-
ican Folk Music to this day, with a day 
that is celebrated on January 13 in his 
honor. The father. 
‘‘Old Uncle Ned,’’ an excerpt: 
Dere was an old n-word, 
Dey call’d him Uncle Ned. 
He’s dead long ago, long ago! 
No more work for poor Old Ned. 
He’s gone where the good n-words go. 
The Father of American Folk Music 
institutionalized racism in song, insti-
tutionalized racism because this insti-
tution made it so. We. Not us person-
ally, but this House made it so. More 
about that in just a moment. 
Let’s look at another song. 
‘‘Oh! Lemuel!’’ These are excerpts. It 
reads: 
Go down to de cotton field! 
Go down, I say! 
Go down and call de n-word boys all: 
We’ll no more today. 
The Father of American Folk Music. 
Proclaimed as such by the United 
States House of Representatives. Insti-
tutionalized as such with the concur-
rence of the United States Senate. Or-
dered as such with the signature of the 
President of the United States of 
America. 
One final one. I shall not read it. I 
will simply place it before you. I trust 
that the camera allows you to see the 
words. ‘‘Away Down Souf,’’ s-o-u-f. 
So now we find ourselves with a day 
honoring Stephen Foster by way of a 
joint resolution, joint resolution au-
thorizing the President—of the United 
States of America, I might add par-
enthetically—to proclaim January 13 
of each year as Stephen Foster Memo-
rial Day. 
It reads, in part, not in total: 
‘‘Whereas Stephen Collins Foster has 
become a national expression of democ-
racy.’’ 
‘‘Stephen Collins Foster has become 
a national expression of democracy 
through his clear and simple embodi-
ment of American tradition in his 
world-famous lyrics.’’ 
So says the House, the Senate, and 
the President such that we honor him 
on January 13 every year. 
The resolution reads: 
‘‘Whereas the songs of Stephen Col-
lins Foster belong to the people’’— 
don’t count me among the people that 
these songs belong to—‘‘belong to the 
people and are the musical essence of 
democracy. . . .’’ This is the musical 
essence of democracy. What a sad state 
of affairs that we have to contend with. 
‘‘Whereas the songs of Stephen Col-
lins Foster belong to the people and are

that he is now recognized as the father 
of American folk music and the true 
interpreter of the fundamental spirit of 
music.’’ 
Stephen Collins Foster. ‘‘Whereas 
Stephen Collins Foster symbolizes in 
his 
works 
the 
unity 
of 
mankind 
through music.’’ This is the unity of 
mankind through music, so says the 
House, the Senate, and the President, 
and a day in honor of Stephen Collins 
Foster. His works symbolize the unity 
of mankind. 
‘‘Resolved by the Senate,’’ these are 
the words. Do a little bit of research, 
and you can read it in its entirety. I 
have given you excerpts, but these are 
the words. ‘‘Resolved by the Senate 
and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress 
assembled: That the President of the 
United States is authorized to issue a 
proclamation designating January 13 of 
each year as Stephen Foster Memorial 
Day, and calling upon the people 
throughout the United States of Amer-
ica to observe such day with appro-
priate ceremonies, pilgrimages to his 
shrines, and musical programs fea-
turing his compositions.’’ I assume 
that would be minstrel shows. ‘‘Ap-
proved October 27, 1951.’’

I was alive when this was approved. I 
am the son of a segregated South. I 
know what racism looks like. I have 
seen the cross that the Klan burned in 
my yard. I know what it sounds like 
having been called these words. I know 
what it hurts like. I have been to some 
funerals. 
Now, my dear friends, my dear broth-
ers and sisters—and I say such because 
I am a student of Dr. King. I believe, as 
he proclaimed, that there really is but 
one race, and that is the human race. I 
believe that all persons were created 
equal from a base black, as Dr. King 
put it, to a treble white. He went on to 
say: 
Fleecy locks and black complexion 
Cannot forfeit nature’s claim; 
Skins may differ, but affection 
Dwells in White and Black the same. 
And, ‘‘Were I so tall as to reach the 
pole or grasp the ocean at a span, I 
must be measured by my soul. The 
mind is the standard of the man’’ and 
woman. 
I believe this. Because I believe it, I 
believe that we all have a responsi-
bility to eliminate this institutional-
ized racism emanating from the Cap-
itol of the United States of America, 
institutionalized 
by 
the 
Congress, 
signed into law by the President, insti-
tutionalized by the Senate Russell Of-
fice Building. 
I love my country. I sing the national 
anthem. There are some parts of it 
that we may want to address at some 
point, but I love my country. I say the 
Pledge of Allegiance. I love my coun-
try. It means something to me to have 
been born in the United States of 
America. I just want to make America 
the beautiful a more beautiful America 
for all Americans. 
I want every little Black baby to 
grow up in a world where we don’t have 
a self-proclaimed white supremacist 
honored with our tax dollars on a 
building built with our tax dollars. 
They deserve that. I would do it for 
any other subset of this society. I 
would stand up for you. 
When will we stand up against insti-
tutionalized racism emanating from 
the Capitol of the United States of 
America? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

THE STRENGTH OF AMERICAN 
AGRICULTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 
30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their marks and submit extra-
neous material on this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kansas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-
ored to host this Special Order during 
National Agriculture Month on the 
strength of American agriculture. I am 
inspired by the American farmers, 
ranchers, and agricultural producers 
who feed, fuel, and clothe not only this 
country but the entire world. 
I grew up on a farm south of Quinter, 
Kansas, that my parents and brother 
still operate. Growing up there meant 
that I spent thousands of hours on a 
tractor working in fields and on horse-
back doctoring sick cattle in the fam-
ily feed yard. Those hours turned into 
love of country and lessons about the 
values of hard work, creativity, flexi-
bility, and putting others before our-
selves. 
My district, the Big First of Kansas, 
is home to more than 60,000 farms 
where farmers, ranchers, feedlot man-
agers, ethanol producers, ag lenders, 
and agribusiness owners ensure that 
America remains the most food-secure 
country in the world. 
As Congress becomes increasingly 
urban, the distance from farm to fork 
has never been greater, and since 
America’s national security depends in 
large part on our food security, we 
need strong voices for agriculture in 
this Congress, which is why I am hon-
ored to serve on the House Agriculture 
Committee and to host this Special 
Order tonight. 
If Congress is going to legislate effec-
tively on matters relating to agri-
culture, Congress must first under-
stand the agricultural perspective in 
America. There is something about 
being in the middle of the country 
where farmers pray for rain, parents 
drive 30 miles both ways just to take 
their kids to school, and communities 
shrink and grow with oil and gas prices 
that gives you a greater perspective. 
House Agriculture Committee Repub-
lican leader GT THOMPSON and I just 
returned from a trip to my district. 
While there, we saw an American 
heartland infused with both the inno-
vative energy that creates new ideas 
and the love of tradition that respects 
tried-and-true methods. We saw the 
USDA National Bio and Agro-Defense 
Facility that will take American agri-
culture into the future, and we met 
with the family who owns and operates 
Brookover Feed Yards, one of the first 
feedlots in Kansas. We also saw oil pro-
duction, ag lending, ethanol produc-
tion, wheat innovation, and the next 
generation of leaders in food and agri-
culture at Kansas State University. 
I look forward to celebrating the cul-
mination 
of 
National 
Agriculture 
Month with my colleagues here tonight 
as we celebrate the force, passion, and 
strength of American agriculture. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON), a 
descendant of dairy farmers, a cham-
pion of rural development, my friend 
who joined me just last week on an ag-
riculture tour of my district in Kansas, 
and the Republican leader of the House 
Agriculture Committee. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
MANN for yielding and for hosting this 
Special Order tonight on an industry 
that I believe is the most important in-
dustry in America. It is the industry 
that impacts and touches the lives of 
American families more times in a 
given day than any other. It is not just 
the food. It is the fiber; it is the build-
ing materials; it is the energy re-
sources; it is the economy. 
I am honored to be here. I am proud 
to be the Republican leader of the 
House Agriculture Committee, where 
we 
celebrate 
the 
contributions 
of 
American farmers, ranchers, producers, 
and foresters all year long. 
Farm country is no stranger to strug-
gle, and the past couple of years have 
been a punch to the gut. Between a 
global pandemic, historic fires and 
floods, wind events, and a President 
who is waging a never-ending war on 
agriculture, times have been particu-
larly tough. 
The supply chain crisis paired with 
skyrocketing inflation is kicking our 
farm families while they are down— 
folks who buy retail, sell wholesale, 
and pay shipping each way; the men 
and women who work around the clock 
to provide us with a safe and reliable 
food supply. 
But rural America is tough; rural 
America is resilient; and rural America 
is the backbone of this Nation. 
I am grateful to Congressman MANN 
for being on our farm team, as well as 
all the other agriculture advocates who 
will be speaking this evening. 
Before I go, I specifically recognize 
Pennsylvania’s contribution to agri-
culture, which is the Commonwealth’s

number one industry. One out of every 
seven jobs is directly or indirectly re-
lated 
to 
agriculture: 
59,000 
farms; 
280,500 direct jobs; and more than $135 
billion in revenue, or about 18 percent 
of 
Pennsylvania’s 
economy. 
Agri-
culture’s impact in the Keystone State 
is undeniable. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the families, 
the men and women who work 24/7, 365 
days a year to feed, to clothe, and to 
fuel this great Nation. Once again, 
thanks to Congressman MANN for lead-
ing this important Special Order. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
THOMPSON for being here tonight and 
sharing with us thoughts about Penn-
sylvania agriculture. It is very impor-
tant to this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE), who 
is a third-generation family farmer and 
good friend. I always appreciate his 
perspectives of Washington State agri-
culture and what he brings to this 
body. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. MANN for his leadership and 
also for hosting us tonight on this spe-
cial occasion to talk about American 
agriculture. 
I am truly proud to stand with my 
colleagues to talk about something 
that affects and impacts every single 
person not only in this room but listen-
ing tonight: the American agriculture 
industry. 
In central Washington, where I am 
from, I know our industry is made up 
of honest, hardworking, freedom-loving 
Americans that provide food and fiber 
for this Nation. My community is 
home to some of the most dedicated, 
innovative agricultural producers in 
the entire country. 
Washington farmers and ranchers 
produce over 300 different commodities, 
including 
high-quality 
hay, 
wheat, 
beef, dairy, wine grapes, hops—which I 
raise—potatoes, cherries, mint, and, of 
course, Washington’s iconic apples. 
Blessed 
with 
the 
conditions 
to 
produce such a diverse range of crops, 
central Washington is proud to share 
its natural abundance to help feed the 
country and feed the world. Those of us 
who live there have a deep appreciation 
for our Nation’s farmers and recognize 
how important it is that we have a 
strong domestic agricultural sector. 
But lately, unfortunately, the Presi-
dent and his far-left Democrats are so 
focused on radically altering the coun-
try with their trillion-dollar spending 
proposals, they are blind to the im-
pacts their own policies are already 
having on Americans across the coun-
try. The cost of living is at a 40-year 
high and still going up. Now, they are 
looking to raise taxes again on small 
businesses, on family farms. 
As a lifetime farmer and former di-
rector of the Department of Agri-
culture for the State of Washington 
and current chairman of the Congres-
sional Western Caucus, I understand 
the vested interests that we all share 
in supporting our agricultural pro-
ducers. I am proud to join my House 
Republican colleagues in advocating 
against burdensome regulations that 
impact rural communities and for real 
solutions, not just empty promises, to 
help our farmers and our ranchers, our 
farmworkers, and all Americans, who 
deserve a strong food supply chain. 
I introduced the first serious agricul-
tural labor reform bill to pass the 
House in over 30 years, the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act, to ensure 
that those who wish to come to our 
country, abide by our laws, and con-
tribute to our farms, ranches, and local 
communities are able to do so. 
I, along with my Republican col-
leagues, am leading efforts to stop our 
foreign adversaries, such as Communist 
China, from gobbling up American 
farmland and taking control of our 
food supply chain. 
I am protecting our hydroelectric 
dams in the Northwest that provide ir-
rigation water, baseload power for cen-
tral Washington and beyond, and serve 
as a sustainable and efficient way to 
transport our Nation’s crops. The Co-
lumbia River barges carry more than 50 
percent of U.S. wheat destined for ex-
port, and barging on the Columbia and 
Snake Rivers system keeps—get this— 
700,000 semitrucks off the roads and 
their emissions out of the air each and 
every year. 
I am leading the entire Congressional 
Western Caucus in fighting against this 
administration’s efforts to revive the 
single-most overreaching Federal regu-
latory action in history. It is called the 
waters of the United States rule, or the 
WOTUS rule. This dangerous policy 
empowers Federal bureaucrats to place 
every single body of water—every 
ditch, every puddle, every stream— 
under Federal regulation. As a result, 
the livelihoods of our farmers and rural 
communities across the Nation—not 
just in Washington; all over the coun-
try—are at stake. 
While it is clear to me, just as I know 
it is clear to my constituents, Presi-
dent Biden and Democrats are failing 
to display the leadership America 
needs and deserves, there is a silver lin-
ing 
here. 
American 
agriculture 
is 
strong. We have overcome far worse, 
and we will not let these radical poli-
cies hold us back from the job of feed-
ing this Nation. 
I call on the administration to take a 
good long look at how their policies are 
harming us here in central Washington 
and in rural communities across the 
country and take immediate steps to 
reverse them. We deserve far better. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. MANN for 
helping recognize the importance of 
American agriculture, and I appreciate 
his leadership. 
b 1945 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the gentleman. His leadership in agri-
culture, his leadership for the Western 
Caucus are very, very important, and I 
thank him for joining us tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), a 
staunch defender of farmers in his dis-
trict and a fellow Congressional FFA 
Caucus member. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman MANN for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, as National Agriculture 
Month comes to a close, I am reminded 
of a speech Paul Harvey delivered to 
the FFA in 1978. No truer words have 
ever been spoken about America’s 
farmers. 
Listening to the speech brings back 
memories of the days spent working 
with my stepdad on his farm. This is a 
tribute, again, to America’s farmers, 
the work they do. And when I read this 
speech, it reminds me, I can see my 
stepdad those days working. But it is a 
tribute to all of the farmers in our 
great country. 
So here are a few of the excerpts that 
I really like from this speech, and it 
goes like this. 
It begins: 
And on the 8th day, God looked down on 
his planned paradise, and said, ‘‘I need a 
caretaker.’’ 
So God made a farmer. 
God said, I need somebody who can shape 
an ax handle from a persimmon sprout, shoe 
a horse with a hunk of car tire, who can 
make a harness out of haywire, feed sacks 
and shoe scraps. Whose planting time and 
harvest season will finish his 40-hour week 
by Tuesday noon, and then pain’n from trac-
tor back, put in another 72 hours. 
So God made a farmer. 
It had to be somebody who’d plow deep and 
straight and not cut corners. Somebody to 
seed, weed, feed, breed, and rake and disc and 
plow and plant and tie the fleece and strain 
the milk and replenish the self-feeder and 
finish a hard week’s work with a 5-mile drive 
to church. 
Somebody who would bale a family to-
gether with the soft, strong bonds of sharing, 
who would laugh, and then sigh, and then 
reply, with smiling eyes, when his son says 
that he wants to spend his life doing what 
dad does. 
So God made a farmer. 
Thank you to America’s farmers. This is a 
tribute to the work that you do every day on 
behalf of not just the United States, but our 
world. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania for join-
ing us tonight. And as you were read-
ing that, I thought about my family, 
my grandparents and many producers 
all over America that that describes. 
Thank you very much for sharing that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER), 
who runs a grain and livestock farm 
with her husband and who has raised 
her children to be the 4th generation of 
farmers on her family farm in Illinois. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Congressman MANN
for 
hosting this Special Order. 
Mr. Speaker, at the conclusion of Na-
tional Agriculture Month, I would like 
to share how strongly I believe in the 
family farm as part of the American 
way of life. It has truly been a blessing 
to have our sons—who are the 4th gen-
eration—and their children—the 5th 
generation—working our land. 
I am proud to be an Illinois farmer 
and to represent the farmers’ needs in

Congress and on the Ag Committee. If 
Americans are hungry, really, what 
else matters? 
The 
agriculture 
industry 
keeps 
Americans and the world fed, fueled, 
and clothed. I am so thankful for the 
work that the ag industry does and for 
their contributions to the GDP and Il-
linois and across our Nation. 
America is on a dangerous path, los-
ing our self-sufficiency in farming, 
which is why I introduced a bill in Con-
gress to prevent China from buying up 
our farmland. Biden and the Democrats 
continue to push policies that promote 
Chinese-made batteries and solar pan-
els instead of American biofuels. 
National Agriculture Month is a 
great time to thank our farmers, 
ranchers, and agriculture professionals 
for their tireless work. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from Illinois for joining 
us tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. VALADAO), who 
represents our Nation’s largest dairy 
district. He and his family operate a 
dairy farm; lives at the dairy. 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
great honor to be able to speak about 
the great people that feed our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent 
the farmers that feed the world. With 
less than 1 percent of our Nation’s 
farmland, the Central Valley supplies a 
quarter of our Nation’s food. Our well- 
deserved 
reputation 
as 
America’s 
breadbasket comes from the help of na-
ture and a whole lot of hard work and 
skill from our farmers, ranchers, and 
producers. But without water, we can-
not grow our Nation’s food at all. 
Our Central Valley farming commu-
nity has endured drought conditions 
and low water allocations for years. At 
a time when even the President is 
warning about global food shortages, 
we need to be supporting our agri-
culture producers here at home. That 
includes making sure that the Central 
Valley has the water they need to con-
tinue providing food for the world. We 
must fix complex and contradictory 
laws, court decisions, and regulations, 
and improve water storage infrastruc-
ture to bring more water to the Valley. 
The livelihoods of my constituents 
and our global food supply depend on 
it. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for joining us tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ELLZEY), the pride of 
Levelland, Texas, who farmed and 
ranched in the Texas Panhandle before 
he came to Congress. 
Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Speaker, I come 
before the House of Representatives to 
bring 
attention 
to 
National 
Agri-
culture Month. And, of course, before I 
begin my prepared remarks, I want to 
talk about what we see going on in 
Ukraine and Russia. 
Ukraine is the breadbasket of that 
region. And 30 percent of all of the 
world’s grain, wheat, is produced in 
that region. And as we talk about this 
today, and in a few months we are 
going to be talking about it even more, 
about how the farms and ranches of the 
United States feed the entire world. 
Over the past couple of years our 
farmers have faced unprecedented ob-
stacles from COVID, COVID lockdowns, 
labor shortages, supply chain disrup-
tions, high fuel prices, and record-high 
fertilizer prices. But as always, they 
have overcome those challenges, and 
they have kept Americans and the 
world fed during a time of great uncer-
tainty. 
Each American farmer feeds more 
than 165 people. Texas leads the Nation 
in the number of farms and ranches, 
with 248,416 farms and ranches covering 
127 million acres. The ag industry is 
the pillar of a healthy and prosperous 
nation. And in the 6th Congressional 
District of Texas, we have a long his-
tory of farming and ranching. We are 
home to families like the Beeklys, the 
Patmans, the Buchholzes, the Borns, 
and the Dineens. 
Many of them have earned the title 
of a ‘‘Texas Century Farm’’ or Texas 
Century Ranch.’’ Those titles are only 
given to families that have served our 
country as farmers and ranchers for 
over 100 years. Families who get up be-
fore dawn to tend to crops and herd 
cattle. They are part of over 5,000 
farms and ranches in my district. 
So if you fed your family today, 
thank a farmer. Thank a rancher. And 
in Texas, thank a neighbor. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Texas for joining us, 
and representing Texas in such a leg-
acy of agriculture in a great State. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone who 
spoke today for helping Congress un-
derstand an agricultural perspective. 
As Dwight Eisenhower—who was from 
my State, from my district—said, 
Farming looks mighty easy when your 
plow is a pencil, and you are a thou-
sand miles away from a cornfield. 
Today, it felt like the Members who 
spoke on this floor brought the farm a 
little closer to Capitol Hill, and for 
that, I thank them. 
Congress uses the reauthorization of 
the farm bill every 5 years to deter-
mine the nature of our support for the 
men and women who feed, fuel, and 
clothe the world. America’s food secu-
rity is so important because it deter-
mines the strength of our national se-
curity. We will never be a secure coun-
try if we have to rely on other coun-
tries to feed ourselves. 
Because of the tenacity of the Amer-
ican farmer, we are the most food se-
cure country in the world, and I will do 
everything in my power to keep it that 
way. 
As Congress determines how we will 
support farmers, ranchers, and agricul-
tural producers in the 2023 farm bill, I 
encourage Members to imagine how 
different their lives would be without 
healthy American agriculture. From 
the food on our tables to the fuel in our 
cars to the fibers in our clothing to the 
roofs over our head, agriculture is all 
around us, and we tend to take it for 
granted. 
Well, it isn’t granted. It is gifted. 
Every day American farmers, ranchers, 
and agricultural producers give us the 
gift of our quality of life in this coun-
try. Our comforts come from the sweat 
of their brows. The least this Congress 
can do is support their efforts whole-
heartedly with a strong thoughtful 2023 
farm bill and related legislation. The 
future of America depends on it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

RESCINDING TITLE 42 OF THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleagues for coming down here and 
talking about the importance of farm-
ing in the United States. One of the 
things we are dealing with, obviously, 
and talked about, is some fertilizer 
shortages. I know that firsthand, see-
ing some of the farms in the district I 
represent, West Texas and so forth. 
And we have got a lot of issues we have 
got to address. 
And I just want to note, as a Texan— 
we had my fellow Texan down here just 
a little bit ago—that here we sit again. 
Here it is, March 31, in an empty 
Chamber again. It is the close of a 
quarter, a fiscal quarter. Members got 
their places to go, their dinners to go 
to. 
We just ran through a handful of 
votes today. No amendments. No de-
bates. 
Here is the people’s House in all its 
glory. No debate. No discussion. 
Did we have a single debate here in 
the people’s House about what is hap-
pening at our southern border today? 
Any discussion at all? 
Does the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives give a rat’s rear-end 
about South Texas or the rest of this 
country; about the ranchers that are 
dealing with a flood of people coming 
across our border, endangering them 
and their families? No, they don’t care. 
They don’t care at all. But I can tell 
you, we in Texas care. And the leader-
ship of this body better start caring 
soon. 
And let me just say something to all 
my fellow Republicans who just funded 
this government two weeks ago. Those 
of you who cut a deal, a deal with the 
devil, you are responsible for this, too. 
You funded this government. You fund-
ed the government that is allowing 
people to come across our border, that 
is empowering cartels, that is allowing 
migrants to get abused, that is causing 
ranchers to lose their livestock, ranch-
ers to be endangered, fentanyl to pour 
across our border. 
And now this administration has the 
gall to shut down Title 42 while Ameri-
cans are still wearing masks on air-
planes, while we still have men and

power of government. And the leader-
ship, so-called leadership, of our gov-
ernment has the gall to shut down 
Title 42. The one thing allowing us to 
stop the flood at our border, even par-
tially. 
March of this year. This year. Right 
now. 
March, 
200,000 
apprehensions; 
100,000 turned away under Title 42. But 
now the head of the CDC, in coordina-
tion with the Department of Homeland 
Security Secretary, is saying we are 
going to stop using Title 42. 
Well, then what in the hell are you 
going to do? Nothing. Other than proc-
ess more immigrants coming across 
our border who are not truly seeking 
asylum. But that is what is happening. 
And what is actually happening at our 
border right now is there are shootouts 
going on as we speak on a daily basis, 
between the Gulf Cartel—technically, 
the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, but 
Gulf Cartel CDG warring with Cartel 
del Noreste of Los Zetas. 
And we are talking about dead peo-
ple, dead bodies. People getting shot in 
their car. Bullets firing, flying all over 
our southern border. Dead individuals. 
This young girl here, head blown off. 
All of this is happening every single 
day. All while American kids are dying 
from Xanax laced with fentanyl. 
And again, I want to be clear here. 
When you take Title 42 away—you, 
Secretary Mayorkas; you, CDC Direc-
tor Walensky; you, my Democratic col-
leagues who are countering and fund-
ing it; you, President Biden—when you 
take away Title 42, the blood is on your 
hands. 
b 2000 
And we’re talking about dead Ameri-
cans, dead migrants, destroyed commu-
nities in Texas, empowered cartels. 
Literally last night in talking to peo-
ple coming across the border, saying 
they are spending $3,000 to $5,000 to 
come up from Nicaragua, Venezuela, 
Cuba. There were 13,000 apprehensions 
from Russia in the last 5 months. 
We are about to see an unprecedented 
explosion 
on 
our 
southern 
border. 
Again, this administration not only 
doesn’t care, it is purposeful. It is 100 
percent purposeful. Endangering the 
people of the United States, endan-
gering migrants while—in the false 
name of compassion saying it is good 
for them, empowering cartels, knowing 
they are doing it. Knowing for the 
most part you do not have a legitimate 
claim for asylum. 
They are purposely not enforcing the 
laws of the United States. They are 
purposely not using the tools at their 
disposal, like now ending Title 42. For 
what reason? For crass political pur-
poses. That is your modern Democratic 
Party. Using migrants for political 
purposes and endangering them and 
Americans in the process. 
It is a gross violation of the oath 
taken to defend the Constitution of the 
United States. It is fully and entirely 
impeachable 
and 
every 
Republican 
should be agreeing to impeach Sec-
retary Mayorkas on day one when we 
come into this body and we are in 
charge of the House of Representatives 
next January after the absolute feck-
less destruction of this country by an 
incompetent, destructive Democratic 
majority in this body, an incompetent 
destructive and flat out reckless ad-
ministration refusing to enforce the 
laws of the United States. That is what 
is happening. 
Oh, you going down there ranting on 
the floor again about the border? Well, 
excuse me, but it is Texas. And Texas 
needs to be starting to take a little ac-
tion to tell the rest of this country to 
shove it up its rear end because Texas 
is taking it on the chin because the 
leadership of this country is forsaking 
Texas, hurting Texas, hurting my 
neighbors, hurting my community. 
It is about time that it stops. It is 
about time that Republicans on this 
side of the aisle stop giving lip service 
to border security, choose to actually 
do their job and not fund the govern-
ment that is refusing to enforce the 
laws. 
I listened to Republican leadership 
down here on the floor a few weeks ago 
trying to tell me, oh—thank me for 
giving us more money for ICE and Bor-
der Patrol. Well, how the heck is that 
working out now? More money for 
more processing of more migrants get-
ting abused by cartels. More money for 
more processing of more migrants to 
come into Uvalde, Texas, where the 
mayor just texted me 5 minutes ago. 
Tell them—in case you are wondering, 
that is you Democrats across the other 
side of the aisle, and by the way, Re-
publican 
leadership—Tell 
them 
to 
come and see the—I will edit his re-
marks—crap show they have created 
500 to 1,000 a day in Eagle Pass in Del 
Rio. No vetting. 
These are human beings, Texans, peo-
ple we represent, our communities. I 
promise my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle they don’t give a whit. 
They sit in their smug chairs in their 
committee hearings saying: Oh, this is 
all made up. There is nothing to it. It 
is all lies. 
Just like the lie that President Biden 
said and his press secretary said when 
he accused Border Patrol agents of 
whipping people. They are flat out lies. 
Where are those Border Patrol agents 
now? Have they been returned to their 
job? Has a report come out? No. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
GOOD), my friend who accompanied me 
on a trip to the border about a month 
ago or so. He is a good friend and he 
understands what is actually hap-
pening at our border. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas. We 
don’t have a finer patriot and a more 
courageous warrior for freedom in the 
Congress, and I appreciate his leader-
ship on this and so many issues. I ap-
preciate him leading this discussion 
here on the floor tonight. 
Never in the history of the country 
has our own President done more to in-
tentionally harm the country than this 
President has done in his first year in 
Congress. Never in the history of the 
country has a President done more to 
harm the United States than this 
President has done willfully and inten-
tionally than what he has done with 
the border in his first year. 
We are averaging 7,000 illegals across 
the border a day right now. The admin-
istration is admitting that. They are 
allowing 7,000 illegals across the border 
a day. I had a constituent say to me on 
the phone just 2 days ago: Nothing this 
administration is doing makes sense 
unless they hate the country. Nothing 
that 
this 
administration 
is 
doing 
makes sense unless they hate the coun-
try. 
Whether you are talking about the 
crime crisis, the inflation crisis, our di-
minished standing on the national 
stage, the spending crisis, the energy 
crisis, what we are doing to American 
energy and making us depend on for-
eign nations who hate us. I think at 
the top of that list is what we are doing 
at the border. 
When I ran for the first time 2 years 
ago I identified the greatest threats to 
the country. I believe those threats are 
our education system, indoctrination 
of our kids K to 12 and college cam-
puses, our runaway radical spending 
that is bankrupting our future, and 
then our immigration and border situa-
tion. Nothing has changed my mind to 
that effect in my first year here. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been to the bor-
der four times and I am well-aware 
that Virginia’s Fifth District is not 
geographically physically located at 
the border. We just had an MS–13 gang 
member convicted of murder in my 
hometown of Lynchburg, Virginia, who 
illegally came across the border. This 
President’s policies are making every 
town a border town, every State a bor-
der State. 
Everything and everyone that comes 
across that border comes under the 
control of the Mexican crime cartels. It 
has threatened the security of our Na-
tion. It is an economic security issue. 
It is a health security issue. It cer-
tainly is a national security issue. 
The projection that I am seeing with 
the ending of Title 42—the egregious 
attempt to end Title 42—the projec-
tions I am seeing is it will take it from 
7,000 a day to 18,000 a day. That is 7,000 
a day to 18,000 a day, perhaps even tri-
pling what has already happened. We 
had 2 million crossings a year ago. Ex-
trapolate that out for 4 years. 
Are we going to allow this President 
to have 8 million come across at the 
current pace? My most recent trip to 
the border that my friend from Texas 
was mentioning was to Del Rio, Texas. 
He led a trip to Del Rio, Texas. You 
might remember, that is where we had 
Bidentown just a few weeks ago with 
20,000 
Haitian 
migrants 
assembled 
under the bridge there in Bidentown in 
Del Rio, Texas.

While we don’t have that still today 
because they distributed those mi-
grants—those illegals—into the inte-
rior of the country, which they are 
doing all the time, by the way. Flying 
and bussing illegal aliens in the dark of 
night 
wherever 
they 
want 
to 
go 
throughout the country with no re-
quirement of a court date to appear. It 
is a pinky promise that we will get 
back with you in the future and give 
you a date to appear. 
While 
we 
don’t 
have 
20,000 
in 
Bidentown under the bridge right now 
in Del Rio, Texas, right through that 
corridor, Border Patrol and the ranch-
ers and the sheriffs that were there 
told us it is 1,000 a day through there. 
So every 3 weeks you got a repeat of 
what we saw with Bidentown just a few 
weeks ago in Del Rio, Texas. 
Does this administration care? Every 
resource they have committed or di-
rected to that border has been to facili-
tate—to 
willfully, 
purposely 
facili-
tate—more illegals crossing into our 
country and to hide it from the Amer-
ican people. 
There has been no effort by this ad-
ministration in this President’s first 
year to stem it, to stop it, instead, 
they try to facilitate and hide it from 
the American people. Now they want to 
make it worse, two or three times 
worse with what they are doing with 
Title 42. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, before I yield 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, I 
just want to pick up on something that 
the gentleman from Virginia said and 
see if he would agree. If Title 42 goes 
away, our country is completely open 
to anyone who wants to come. Would 
the gentleman agree? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Absolutely. 
Mr. ROY. Everyone who has been 
turn away, it has almost entirely been 
done under Title 42. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. That is right. 
Mr. ROY. Now, for the listeners at 
home, Title 42 is a health code provi-
sion allowing our officials in govern-
ment to turn people away if we have a 
communicable 
disease 
environment, 
like we do during the COVID pandemic. 
Now, we can do it for any number of 
communicable diseases, but we got 
that in place now. 
Roughly half of the folks have been 
turned away under Title 42. Would the 
gentleman agree? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Yes, but they 
are turnarounds coming right back. 
Mr. ROY. So to that point, would it 
surprise the gentleman that under the 
administration we have turned away 
1.7 million people under Title 42? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Since 2019 
when that was instated, right? 
Mr. ROY. Yeah, including the time 
under the Trump administration. So 1.7 
million times during the pandemic all 
the people that were turned back would 
likely have been let in and released 
into the United States under this ad-
ministration. Some of those are re-
peats. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. That is right. 
Mr. ROY. Something along the lines 
of a million people that would have 
been released into the United States 
last year. Does the gentleman agree? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Absolutely. 
Mr. ROY. Another point. Of the peo-
ple that have come into the United 
States and are being encountered, 
these are all not just nice people look-
ing for a job, are they? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. There are 160 
different countries. 
Mr. ROY. One hundred sixty different 
countries. 
Roughly, 
10,763 
criminal 
noncitizens and at least 3,662 have been 
arrested thus far in fiscal year 2022. 
The 
combined 
timeframes 
include 
roughly 85 convictions of manslaughter 
or homicide, 604 sexual offenses, and 
2,892 convictions of illegal drug posses-
sion and trafficking. Based on reports 
at least 14 illegal migrants who are on 
the terrorist watch list were stopped at 
the southern border in fiscal year 2021. 
The biggest problem is what? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. The got- 
aways. 
Mr. ROY. The got-aways. The more 
than half a million known got-aways— 
known—known got-aways—last year. 
So if we have got people we are catch-
ing on the terrorist watch list, if we 
have got criminals convicted of sex 
crimes, convicted of murder and man-
slaughter that we are catching—but 
that is all people the Border Patrol is 
running across and they are often turn-
ing themselves in. All of those known 
got-aways, do you think those are just 
the angels seeking a nice job? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. These aren’t 
the ones dressed head to toe in camo 
with the carpet shoes on who are evad-
ing capture, are they? 
Mr. ROY. It would be. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. How about 
that. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY), one of the great patriots and I 
am proud to call him my friend. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Texas, he has been the con-
summate crusader on this issue. If not 
for him, this would even be more ig-
nored in Washington, D.C., than it is 
already. I just think about a scant 
month ago—a month and a half ago or 
so—the President of the United States 
stood right there and talked about se-
curing the border. 
It is unfathomable to me. We used to 
not say lie in the world of politics 
about your opponent or the other 
party, but I don’t know what else that 
is other than a lie. I come from Penn-
sylvania, we are not on the border 
where Mr. ROY represents, where his 
communities and his State is being 
completely overrun. Pennsylvania is 
far from the border. We got Route 81. 
We got Route 83. The fentanyl comes 
up. 
The President took an oath to faith-
fully discharge the laws of this coun-
try, but just abrogating them. You just 
wonder who is he representing? Whose 
citizens is he representing because the 
people in my community, the people 
all across the country are dying at 
record levels from drugs coming across 
the southern border, and nothing is 
happening to stop it. 
It is not only people coming here ille-
gally and taking your jobs—all these 
different languages that your school 
has to teach now. Somebody is going to 
pay for that. Who can afford this? 
Whose job is it to safeguard America? 
If it is not the President’s job, whose 
job is it? CHIP ROY is trying. BOB GOOD 
is trying. 
We can’t keep Title 42 in place. Even 
better yet, the question should be: Why 
isn’t Remain in Mexico in place? Seek 
asylum the correct way. Stay in the 
first country you come to if you are in-
deed oppressed and you are suffering 
political retribution for your beliefs or 
religious persecution—the first country 
you come to. 
The first country you come to when 
you travel through Mexico—when you 
fly into Mexico from one of the other 
160–190 countries on the planet isn’t the 
United States, it is Mexico. Yet, the 
President says the border is open. 
These people aren’t coming to the 
White House, ladies and gentlemen, 
they are coming to your house. They 
are coming to your community. They 
are not going to Joe Biden’s house in 
Delaware. They are not coming to 
Pennsylvania Avenue. They are coming 
to your house and your community and 
they are bringing the drugs with them, 
human trafficking. 
And for goodness sakes—your taxes— 
75 percent of the people on this side of 
the aisle just supported more spending 
for this. You know what it does? BOB 
GOOD is right. You are not going see 
them all piled up under the bridge in 
Del Rio because we are going to hire 
more people to move them more effi-
ciently into your town because they 
don’t like that look. 
They are not hired to stop them, they 
are hired to more efficiently have them 
come to your town and your commu-
nity, including the people on the ter-
rorist 
watch 
list, 
criminals, 
the 
fentanyl, the human trafficking com-
ing to your town. Well, thank you, Mr. 
President. 
Mr. ROY. I would ask my friend from 
Pennsylvania if he is aware that our 
colleague and colleague in the House 
Freedom Caucus, our friend YVETTE 
HERRELL from New Mexico, introduced 
legislation a year ago—actually over a 
year ago to require the use of Title 42. 
Is that right? 
b 2015 
Mr. PERRY. That is right. And all we 
need is enough people to sign it. 
Whether you are a Democrat or you are 
a Republican, these folks are coming. 
The fentanyl is coming to your town. 
The overdoses are coming to your 
town. All you have to do, if your lead-
ership says: We refuse to move this bill 
that the American people want, main-
tain this Title 42, all you have to do is 
go down and sign that piece of paper,

and we can do it. Leadership can’t hold 
us up. 
But they don’t want to do it, do 
they? 
Mr. ROY. They do not. And I want to 
make sure for every American out 
there to understand the truth. If you 
are disgusted about what is happening 
at our border, if you are concerned 
about what is actually happening to 
our communities, there is a way we can 
solve the problem without Speaker 
PELOSI making the decisions. Because 
that is how things work. We don’t ever 
debate, we don’t ever amend, and we 
don’t actually have discussion in the 
people’s House. The Speaker in a back-
room decides what happens on the 
floor, vote ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no,’’ walk out, 
and give a press conference 
But we can do something about that. 
There is a tool. It is called a discharge 
petition. We have a discharge petition 
at the desk to try to empower the ac-
tual Representatives of this country. 
We have 200 and I think now eight Re-
publicans on that discharge petition. 
Mr. PERRY. How many Democrats? 
Mr. ROY. We have zero Democrats— 
not one Democrat—on that discharge 
petition. Now, I want everybody to 
think about that. The Democrats in 
this body apparently are so beholden to 
the radical idea of wide-open borders 
and not implementing Title 42 while 
Americans are being forced to wear 
masks on airplanes, and while Ameri-
cans are getting a jab needle stuck in 
their arm by force of government if 
they are in the military or Border Pa-
trol or any other Federal employee 
while there is still a Federal health 
emergency in place under order of the 
President. 
Mr. PERRY. We are firing people who 
were on the front lines at the begin-
ning of the pandemic without it, where 
there was no vaccine present, right? 
They went out. They went out and 
risked their lives not knowing what 
they were dealing with, and now unless 
they take the jab, now they are out of 
work. 
Mr. ROY. So while that is in place, 
we have a discharge petition where we 
can bring to the floor and vote to force 
enforcement of Title 42 in this country, 
and not one of our Democratic col-
leagues will join us in that. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. How many 
Democrat Members have we got from 
Texas? 
Mr. ROY. We have 13. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. That would 
get us past 218, wouldn’t it, 13 plus 8, 
208? 
Mr. ROY. It sure would. I think there 
are somewhere around 50 Democratic 
Members from border States if you 
count New Mexico, Arizona, California, 
and Texas. 
So where are my Democratic col-
leagues in border States? 
I think they ought to be asked. I 
want to know why won’t my Demo-
cratic colleagues from border States or 
anywhere else in the country say they 
believe that we ought to enforce Title 
42? 
Because guess what? There are a few 
Senators who have said so. 
Isn’t that right? 
Mr. PERRY. There are a few Sen-
ators. I think there are a few Rep-
resentatives who said so, too. They can 
put their money, so to speak, where 
their mouth is. You can say it, but you 
can take some action. Talk is cheap, 
right? Take some action and walk 
down there and sign the paper. And 
once one does, maybe a few more will 
because 
their 
constituents—their 
bosses, their citizens, and their com-
munities—are being wrecked, too. 
Mr. ROY. It is a way to wrestle con-
trol of the people’s House away from a 
handful of self-anointed individuals 
who are wrecking this country in the 
name of so-called democracy. 
Does my friend from Virginia agree? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Absolutely. 
You mentioned Secretary Mayorkas. 
He has said the border is secure. The 
border is secure he has said, when as 
you know we have lost operational con-
trol of our border. 
The Mexican crime cartels are mak-
ing hundreds of millions of dollars a 
month off sex trafficking, drug traf-
ficking, child trafficking, human traf-
ficking, you name it. Everyone and ev-
erything that comes across that border 
comes under the control of the Mexican 
crime cartel. 
There is no humane component to it. 
They are finding dead bodies at the 
border of people who were trying—they 
starved or they got dehydrated or they 
just couldn’t make the journey or 
something happened to them on the 
way. And you talk about Remain in 
Mexico policy, instead of Remain in 
Mexico policy, the MPP, that was in 
place under the Trump administration. 
We have got the United Nations using 
our own resources that we pay the 
United Nations to help illegals cheat 
our asylum system. So the United Na-
tions is taking resources that the 
United States is giving to them to use 
to train illegals on how to cheat our 
asylum system and how to gain access 
into our country by claiming asylum. 
Then the Democratic Party 20 years 
ago passed a law that prohibits the re-
quirement of proof of citizenship to 
vote. Now, of course, they don’t want 
any ID in order to vote, and you have 
got the President promising amnesty 
to anybody who is here illegally. 
Do you think there is incentive to 
cheat our voting system and to vote il-
legally when there is no requirement of 
proof of citizenship, there is no ID to 
vote, and you have got the promise of 
amnesty? 
We have essentially got illegals with 
a license to vote here in this country 
right now, and here we want to con-
tinue to ramp it up, to take it from 
7,000 a day to an estimate of maybe 
18,000 a day by eliminating Title 42. 
Mr. PERRY. Would the gentleman 
also agree that it is not only the U.N. 
that your tax dollars are going for, ac-
tually in this body they voted recently 
to pay for attorneys to go help those 
folks who came across the border ille-
gally navigate the system. 
Now, you go try that. You go break 
the law wantonly and then appeal to 
your Federal Government to pay for 
your attorney to get around the law 
that you just broke wantonly. 
Mr. ROY. Both my friends, the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania and the gen-
tleman from Virginia, you guys are 
both fathers, correct? 
Mr. PERRY. Indeed. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Yes. 
Mr. ROY. Do you think that there is 
anything compassionate—when my col-
leagues on the other side of aisle like 
to talk about their compassion for mi-
grants who are seeking to come to this 
country, do my friends think there is 
anything at all compassionate about a 
little girl getting raped in a stash 
house in Houston, Texas, as we speak? 
Or being driven up and put into the 
sex trafficking trade up I–35 or across 
I–10 in the southern part of the United 
States? 
Or trafficked to anywhere through-
out the rest of this country? 
Do you think that is compassion? 
Do you think it is compassionate for 
a young woman to be getting shot up in 
a cartel warfare happening at south 
Texas, happening along the Rio Grande 
in northern Mexico? 
Is that compassion? 
Is it compassion? 
Mr. PERRY. What about the rape 
trees? 
We have been to the border. We have 
seen the little shoes all stacked up at 
the border. These are little children. 
And Representative ROY is absolutely 
right, as trophies, can you imagine lit-
tle girls, or somebody’s—anybody’s— 
little girls, little girl panties hanging 
from a tree as a trophy? 
This is what our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle refuse to ac-
knowledge, like it is not happening, 
like it has never happened. But it is 
happening every single day. Some-
body—somebody—has got to do some-
thing about it. 
Mr. ROY. Is it compassionate for the 
young man or young woman of the 
100,000 or so last year who died from 
drug overdoses to take Xanex and it be 
laced with fentanyl and die? 
Is that something that is compas-
sionate? 
My friend from Virginia, do you 
think these are compassionate things 
to be doing? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. The number 
one killer of Americans between the 
age of 18 and 45 last year was drug 
overdoses. And yet we are allowing the 
most dangerous drugs, fentanyl and 
other 
dangerous 
drugs, 
to 
stream 
across the border. 
The only way you get across the bor-
der, the Mexican border, into the 
United States is to pay the Mexican 
crime cartels. Border Patrol and the 
local sheriffs will tell you: If you try to 
cross apart from the cartels, they will 
kill you. You come either beholden to 
them, essentially an indentured serv-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4070 
March 31, 2022 
home if you don’t have the cash up 
front—they will kill your family if you 
don’t pay—or you work it off. You 
work it off by trafficking drugs across 
or trafficking children or trafficking 
women across the border. There is 
nothing compassionate about that. 
Mr. ROY. One of my good friends who 
was a former Texas Department of 
Public Safety expert on these issues 
dealing with cartels just sent me a text 
showing me video from last night at 
the border, and individuals they were 
recording were saying they were pay-
ing $3,000 or $5,000 to get across the 
river. 
How is that compassionate? 
They are going to have to make a 
monthly payment to cartels. A lot of 
those payments are going to come in 
the form of sex trafficking and labor 
trafficking. 
I have about 11⁄2 minutes remaining. I 
would just say—and I thank my friends 
for joining me down here on the House 
floor—that this is a solvable problem 
right now. This could be stopped right 
now. It could be stopped right now. 
Mr. PERRY. This hour. 
Mr. ROY. This hour. This moment. 
But where is President Biden? 
Where is Secretary Mayorkas? 
Other than purposely ignoring the 
laws of the United States to endanger 
the American people and the migrants 
who seek to come here, where are they? 
And why shouldn’t we be impeaching 
Secretary Mayorkas for failing to 
faithfully execute the laws of the 
United States and causing death and 
destruction to Americans’ property and 
to American people in the form of drug 
overdoses, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
endangerment of our citizens and, 
again, the migrants who seek to come 
here? 
I would ask that question of all my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle: You can take this back and wres-
tle it away from the administration. 
Sign that discharge petition. Let’s 
have a vote. Let’s have a debate. 
What are my colleagues afraid of? 
The truth? 
What are they afraid of? 
The rule of law? 
What are they afraid of? 
A secure America? 
Migrants who get to come here safe-
ly? 
Put aside the politics and stand up 
for our country. That is our job as 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen 
from Virginia and Pennsylvania for 
their leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Members are reminded to address 
their remarks to the Chair, not to a 
perceived viewing audience.

COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, March 31, 2022. 
MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA) and the Con-
current Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal 
Year 2021 (S. Con. Res. 14 (117th Congress)), I 
hereby submit for printing in the Congres-
sional Record a revision to the aggregates 
and allocations set forth in the Statement of 
Aggregates, Allocations, and Other Budg-
etary Levels for Fiscal Year 2022 published in 
the Congressional Record on October 27, 2021, 
as revised. 
This adjustment responds to House consid-
eration of the bill, the Marijuana Oppor-
tunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, 
or the MORE Act (H.R. 3617), as provided for 
consideration in the House pursuant to H. 
Res. 1017. This adjustment is allowable under 
sections 3003(b) and 4007 of S. Con. Res. 14 
(117th). It shall apply while that legislation 
is under consideration and take effect upon 
the enactment of that legislation. 
Accordingly, I am revising the aggregate 
revenue level for fiscal years 2022–2031 and 
the allocation for the House Committee on 
the Judiciary for fiscal years 2022–2031. For 
purposes of enforcing titles III and IV of the 
CBA and other budgetary enforcement provi-
sions, the revised aggregates and allocation 
are to be considered as aggregates and allo-
cations included in the budget resolution, 
pursuant to the Statement published in the 
Congressional Record on October 27, 2021, as

S1875 
Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2022 
No. 57 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable JACKY 
ROSEN, a Senator from the State of Ne-
vada. 
f 
PRAYER 
Mr. 
SULLIVAN. 
Today’s 
opening 
prayer will be offered by our guest 
Chaplain, Rabbi Mendy Greenberg, Di-
rector 
of 
Mat-Su 
Jewish 
Center, 
Chabad-Lubavitch, in Palmer, AK. 
The guest Chaplain offered the fol-
lowing prayer: 
Almighty God, Master of the Uni-
verse, we stand before You in prayer in 
these troubling times when innocent 
men, women, and children have lost 
their lives and millions fled their 
homeland due to the catastrophic war 
in Ukraine. In the words of King David, 
Psalms, Chapter 121: 
I lift my eyes to the mountains—from 
where will my help come? My help will come 
from the Lord, Maker of heaven and earth. 
May You, Almighty God, grant the 
Members of this honorable body wis-
dom and understanding that the ulti-
mate way to eliminate the cause of war 
and bring true peace to the world is by 
embodying the universal values of the 
seven commandments issued to Noah 
after the great flood, foremost of which 
is not to commit murder. 
Almighty God, I beseech You to bless 
the U.S. Senate assembled today to ful-
fill one of Your seven commandments 
to govern by just laws and in the merit 
of the global spiritual giant and leader, 
Your 
servant, 
the 
Rebbe, 
Rabbi 
Menachem M. Schneerson, whose 120th 
birthday will be celebrated this coming 
month on the 11th day of Nissan, Tues-
day, April 12. 
In 1978, this honorable body estab-
lished the Rebbe’s birthday as Edu-
cation and Sharing Day USA and is 
proclaimed annually by the President 
of the United States in recognition of 
the Rebbe’s global campaign to bring 
awareness and educate our youth about 
these ethical values of the Seven 
Noahide Laws as the basis for a just 
and compassionate society. 
Almighty God, may it be in the merit 
of realizing the Rebbe’s vision for hu-
manity, we speedily see the fulfillment 
of Isaiah’s promise: 
Nation shall not lift up sword against na-
tion, neither shall they learn war anymore. 
With the coming of Moshiach, Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Alaska. 
RABBI MENDY GREENBERG 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
thank you for allowing me to open the 
Senate with you. It was a true honor to 
have Rabbi Mendy Greenberg, who is 
doing amazing work in Palmer, AK, 
open the Senate with his very powerful 
and meaningful prayer and very appro-
priate prayer for what is happening in 
the world. 
I just want to say a little bit about 
our incredible Jewish community in 
Alaska. Rabbi Greenberg’s parents are 
actually up in the Gallery watching— 
his father, Rabbi Greenberg and his in-
credible wife, Esti. 
I just want to say what they do for 
our—community—communities 
throughout Alaska—is so powerful, so 
meaningful, and touches so many lives 
way beyond the Jewish community of 
Alaska—way beyond that community. 
I love the phrase referring to our won-
derful Jewish community of Alaska, 
the ‘‘frozen chosen,’’ because it is a lit-
tle cold in our State, as most Ameri-
cans know. 
But here is the thing about this com-
munity: They are incredible in terms of

have this annual event called the Jew-

dreds of Alaskans of all faiths who par-

my favorite things to do as an Alaskan, 
to come and celebrate not just the Jew-
ish community, but the spirit of to-
getherness, the spirit of faith, and the 
spirit of taking care of one another. 
That is what this incredible commu-
nity does, led by both Rabbi Green-
bergs, who we saw the younger today 
give this very powerful prayer. 
I want to thank him and his parents 
for being here today. It is not always 
easy to get to DC from Alaska—a cou-
ple of thousand miles at least. To our 
Jewish community back home, to the 
Greenbergs for all they have done, I 
just want to, on the Senate floor here, 
offer my deepest thanks for the exam-
ple they set for the entire State of 
Alaska. It is great having them here, 
and what they do for our State is really 
powerful, really important. 
Thank you, Madam President, for al-
lowing me to participate in the opening 
and the prayer this morning. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
H.R. 4373 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first on COVID negotiations, yester-
day, I met with a group of my col-
leagues—Senators 
MURRAY, 
COONS, 
ROMNEY, BLUNT, BURR, and GRAHAM— 
for another round of talks as we work 
toward a bipartisan COVID agreement. 
We spoke throughout the day; we 
talked late into the night; our staffs 
are continuing talks this morning. 
The gap has been narrowed greatly, 
and we are intent on working with Re-
publicans to cross the finish line be-
cause this is vital for our country if, 
God forbid, a new variant arises in the 
future, and that is all too likely. We 
would like considerably more money 
than our Republican colleagues, but we 
need to reach 60 votes to get something 
passed through the Senate, and so we 
are going to push as hard as we can. 
When it comes to replenishing COVID 
response funding, we simply can’t af-
ford to kick the can down the road. 
The White House has been more than 
clear and more than transparent about 
the fact that public funds for COVID 
are at risk of running out. We all know 
that a possible future variant can 
quickly undo much of the progress we 
have made against the virus, so it 
makes no sense whatsoever to hold off 
on COVID funding that we know is very 
much needed right now. The more we 
wait, the bigger the problem will be 
later, God forbid a variant hits. 
The bottom line is this: Both sides 
should work to complete COVID fund-
ing soon because that will mean more 
vaccines, more therapeutics, and more 
testing so we can keep schools and 
communities open. We can stay ‘‘back 
to normal,’’ which we are doing right 
now. Woe is us if a future variant ex-
tends its nasty tentacles across the 
country, and we don’t have the re-
sources in place to respond. Woe is us. 
So, again, I am pleading with my Re-
publican colleagues: Join us. We want 
more than you do, but we have to get 
something done. We have to get some-
thing done. 
We will keep working to arrive at a 
deal in good faith, and we hope—hope, 
hope, hope—our Republican colleagues 
ultimately join us in supporting a ro-
bust enough package to deal with this 
problem. 
As I said, we are making good 
progress. We are getting closer and 
closer, but the sooner we get this deal 
done, the better for the country. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, on cost cutting, it 
has been a productive few days here on 
the Senate floor as we pass legislation 
that will help reduce costs, relieve sup-
ply chains, and build on the incredible 
economic growth we have seen under 
President Biden. 
I am glad to announce that the Sen-
ate is on track to pass bipartisan legis-
lation by Senators KLOBUCHAR
and 
THUNE to reform unfair shipping prac-
tices that are clogging up our ports, di-
minishing American exports, hurting 
our farmers, and ultimately hurting 
consumers. It hurts both ways when 
shipping costs go way up, as they have. 
The exports we send over—a lot of it 
agricultural goods—the imports that 
come back—a lot of it consumer 
goods—all are higher priced, and Amer-
icans pay that higher price. 
So the bipartisan shipping bill is ex-
actly the sort of thing the Senate 
should focus on because when there is a 
logjam at the Port of Los Angeles, it 
hurts farmers and small businesses in 
Minnesota, North Dakota, and across 
the country, and it hurts consumers in 
every corner of the country, from Port-
land, ME, to San Diego, from Seattle 
to Miami, New York, and everywhere 
in between. 
So I am glad we are making progress 
to getting this legislation done. The 
sooner the better, again. 
The legislation, of course, is not the 
only step we have taken this week to 
strengthen supply chains to help lower 
costs throughout the economy. Earlier 
this week, the Senate passed a strongly 
bipartisan jobs and competitiveness 
bill in the works for over a year, which 
will help increase our domestic manu-
facturing, help address the critical chip 
shortage, and grow our economy by in-
vesting in American innovation. 
Yesterday, the House passed a mo-
tion requesting a conference com-
mittee, and the Senate will soon do the 
same. We are on track to initiating a 
conference, hopefully, before the end of 
this work period. 
Off the floor, committees held nu-
merous hearings zeroing in on the 
many dimensions of our lowering cost 
agenda. To name just a few examples, 
the Banking Committee held a hearing 
on Monday on the growing burden of 
medical debt, a problem that is facing 
so many Americans. 
The Small Business Committee also 
held a hearing yesterday exploring the 
supply chain crisis and its implications 
for smaller businesses, including strug-
gling restaurants. 
And, today, the Banking Committee 
is on the matter of seniors who strug-
gle with affordable housing. 
These are just a few examples of how, 
both off the floor and on, Democrats 
are continuing our focus on legislation 
that will lower costs, help American 
families, and solve the deep and dif-
ficult challenges that everyday Ameri-
cans face to make ends meet. And we 
are going to keep pushing in the 
months ahead to translate these ideas 
into legislation we can consider here in 
the Chamber, as we are doing with 
shipping right now. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
well, the Biden administration is on 
track for another record-shattering 
year on our southern border—in all the 
wrong ways. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is reportedly preparing for up to 
18,000 attempted border crossings per 
day—18,000 per day. 
President Biden’s border crisis is a 
symptom of the modern Democratic 
Party’s inability to support any re-
motely reasonable policy of border en-
forcement. 
Now, thus far, the Biden administra-
tion has kept the chaos at least some-
what in check by leaning on emergency 
authorities that are specific to the 
COVID pandemic. To be clear, even 
with these title 42 authorities in place, 
our border has still been in crisis. Last 
month was the worst February in more 
than 20 years. We just saw the worst 12- 
month period for illegal crossings since 
at least—listen to this—1960. This is 
with title 42 in place. Just imagine if 
President Biden kills it. 
But the open-borders far left doesn’t 
like title 42. So now, according to pub-
lic reports, the Biden administration is 
preparing to cave to the radicals, end 
title 42, and effectively throw our bor-
ders completely wide open. 
Ending title 42 without any real bor-
der security plan in place would spark 
a humanitarian and security crisis like 
we have never seen before. But it is 
pretty obvious the far left doesn’t care. 
Open borders are their objective. 
So at the same time Washington 
Democrats are pushing for more Fed-
eral spending on the pandemic, they

March 31, 2022 
want to declare the pandemic is fin-
ished at our southern border. This 
doesn’t add up. 
Throwing the floodgates open for an 
historic spring and summer of illegal 
immigration would be an unforced 
error of historic proportions. It would 
be right up there with the administra-
tion’s $2 trillion in inflationary spend-
ing and their botched retreat from Af-
ghanistan. 
But this goes deeper than just title 42 
and COVID. The fundamental point is 
this: Today’s Democrats need the pre-
text of the pandemic to justify having 
national borders at all. The left feels 
they need the pretext of COVID to have 
any—any—border enforcement whatso-
ever. 
This is absolutely mind-boggling. 
Republicans and the American people 
reject this false choice between perma-
nent COVID versus open borders. We 
can’t only be a sovereign nation during 
pandemics. Americans deserve secure 
borders all the time. 
Functional open borders have per-
vaded the Biden agenda at literally 
every level. The President chose a Su-
preme Court nominee, Judge Jackson, 
who has displayed a major streak of ju-
dicial activism on this very subject, il-
legal immigration. 
In 2019, the judge sided with the left-
wing activists and overlooked plain 
statutory language that gave DHS 
‘‘sole and unreviewable discretion’’ 
over the speedy removal of illegal im-
migrants. Judge Jackson literally just 
brushed aside the plain text of the law 
to reach the policy outcome she want-
ed, and she went even further. She 
issued a nationwide injunction—a na-
tionwide injunction—to impose her 
radical policy view on our entire coun-
try. 
This was a blatant case of judicial ac-
tivism. The ruling read like it belonged 
on the opinion pages of the Washington 
Post. Even the very liberal DC Circuit 
completely disagreed and overturned 
Judge Jackson, with an Obama ap-
pointee writing the opinion. 
It should not be this hard for an ad-
ministration to understand that a na-
tion actually needs borders. 
I strongly urge the President to keep 
title 42 in place and quickly produce an 
actual strategy to do his job and secure 
our border. 
THE ECONOMY 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, the American people know our 
country is hurting. One national sur-
vey just found that only 22 percent say 
our country is headed in the right di-
rection. Seven in ten Americans just 
told another poll that our Nation’s 
economy is ‘‘in poor shape.’’ 
The worst inflation in 40 years is 
fleecing American consumers from the 
gas pump to the grocery store. Amer-
ican workers are earning raises, but 
prices are climbing faster than their 
pay. 
The Biden administration has tried 
to pass the buck for this mess. They 
have tried to blame everything but 
their own radical policies. They have 
claimed that a year of runaway infla-
tion was actually—listen to this— 
‘‘Putin’s price hike,’’ because of a war 
in Europe that is barely a month old. 
They have claimed the problem is evil 
profiteering CEOs, because, apparently, 
the private sector was not seeking 
profits back when the Republicans had 
the economy humming with low infla-
tion just a few years ago. 
American families aren’t buying the 
spin for one second. When asked by an-
other poll what they think is the main 
reason for rising gas prices—listen to 
this—Americans’ top answer was ‘‘the 
Biden administration’s economic poli-
cies.’’ 
An outright majority of the country 
agrees the President has made infla-
tion worse, but the administration 
isn’t changing course. They are actu-
ally doubling down. 
The Biden administration began the 
week by proposing a budget that would 
skyrocket 
domestic 
discretionary 
spending on liberal wish-list items and 
smack the country with the biggest tax 
hike in American history. 
Just last night, Democrats tried to 
ram through another radical nominee 
who would only have compounded the 
economic 
pain. 
President 
Biden’s 
choice of David Weil for a senior post 
at the Department of Labor was a 
naked attempt to achieve through bu-
reaucracy what the far-left cannot 
achieve through legislation. This nomi-
nee is famous in Washington for hos-
tility to small business. He has re-
ceived tens of thousands of dollars 
from Big Labor to do their bidding. He 
openly sought to end both the fran-
chise system and the gig economy as 
we know them. 
Fortunately—fortunately—last 
night, a bipartisan majority of Sen-
ators rallied together. We saved the 
President and the Democratic leader 
from digging themselves into an even 
deeper hole with this nominee. 
Also overnight, we learned President 
Biden is going to try to slap another 
bandaid on gas prices by draining more 
oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve. The reserve is supposed to exist 
for giant unforeseen crises, such as a 
war between great powers. It is not 
there so that anti-energy politicians 
whose policies have raised gas prices 
can try to hide that from the public. 
It is also worth remembering that 
back 
in 
2020, 
as 
oil 
prices 
were 
cratering, Republicans tried to seize 
the opportunity to rebuild the Stra-
tegic Reserve. It would have been a 
win-win-win to help stabilize our en-
ergy industry in the early days of the 
crisis, gotten American taxpayers an 
incredible deal with oil at bargain- 
basement prices, and enhanced our 
readiness going forward. 
But you know what happened. Senate 
Democrats blocked it. They said buy-
ing oil at rock-bottom prices and build-
ing up our reserve would have been— 
listen to this—‘‘a bailout for Big Oil.’’ 
So the Democratic leader bragged 
about killing that proposal. 
You can’t make this stuff up. 
Our colleagues misunderstand basic 
economics and basic national security 
every chance they get. Taxing, spend-
ing, radical nominations, and gim-
micky 
half-measures—the 
American 
people already blame the Democrats 
for the fix we are in, and, every week, 
our colleagues seek new ways to prove 
them right. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, 
this morning, I am going to announce 
my decision on Judge Jackson’s nomi-
nation to the Supreme Court. I will op-
pose her, and I will vote no. 
My decision is based upon her record 
of judicial activism, flawed sentencing 
methodology regarding child pornog-
raphy cases, and a belief Judge Jack-
son will not be deterred by the plain 
meaning of the law when it comes to 
liberal causes. 
I find Judge Jackson to be a person 
of exceptionally good character, re-
spected by her peers, and someone who 
has worked hard to achieve her current 
position. However, her record is over-
whelming in its lack of a steady judi-
cial philosophy and a tendency to 
achieve outcomes in spite of what the 
law requires or commonsense would 
dictate. 
After a thorough review of Judge 
Jackson’s 
record 
and 
information 
gained at the hearing from an evasive 
witness, I now know why Judge Jack-
son was the favorite of the radical left, 
and I will vote no. 
In the area of child pornography, 
there has been an explosion in this 
country of child pornography on the 
internet. In 2021, groups that follow 
sexual abuse of children on the inter-
net reported 29.3 million reports of in-
dividuals accessing information regard-
ing child pornography on the internet. 
It has gone from 100,000 in 2003 to 29.3 
million in 2021. 
It is estimated that there is 85 mil-
lion images and videos and other files 
involving sexually exploited children 
on the internet. 
Now, why is this important? 
This is the venue of choice for the 
child pornographer. It is not the mail. 
As you can see, the internet is where 
these people go. In a matter of min-
utes, they can download hundreds, if 
not thousands, of images and videos of 
the most disgusting abuse of children; 
and my goal is to deter that, not dis-
count it. 
Judge Jackson’s sentencing method-
ology, in my view, misses the mark. I 
don’t doubt that, personally, she is of-
fended by the behavior that we are all

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1878 
March 31, 2022 
talking about, but as a judge, she has 
an opportunity to deter the behavior of 
going on the internet and downloading 
images of exploited children. Every 
time she has that opportunity, she re-
fuses to exercise it. 
Now, why is Judge Jackson’s sen-
tencing so different? 
In possession cases, she gives 29.2 
months, and the average nationally is 
68 months. In the distribution of child 
pornography, 
her 
sentence 
is 
71.9 
months, 
and 
the 
minimum 
is 
60 
months. That is what you have to give. 
The average nationally, they tell me, is 
135 months. The length of sentence for 
the possession of child pornography im-
posed by Judge Jackson is 57 percent 
less than the national average. In the 
area of distribution, it is 40 percent 
less than the national average. 
Why? 
Under 
the 
sentencing 
guidelines, 
judges, if they choose, can enhance the 
sentence based on the fact that the per-
petrator used the internet. 
Now, why do we want that as a sen-
tencing enhancement? 
We want to deter the use of the inter-
net when it comes to child pornog-
raphy because there are already 85 mil-
lion images and videos of children 
being abused, and that is the venue of 
choice. So, instead of deterring that be-
havior, Judge Jackson routinely says 
that she will not hold that against a 
perpetrator. 
I think that is a mistake. She basi-
cally said: It is so easy, in a matter of 
minutes, 
to 
push 
a 
button 
and 
download a bunch of files. That seems, 
to me, to be an unfair way to sentence 
somebody. 
She also takes off the table a sen-
tence enhancement for the number or 
the volume of child pornography being 
possessed or distributed. 
I think that is absolutely backward. 
I think what we should be doing is that 
every time you mash the button and 
download an image of a child being ex-
ploited, your time in jail should go up. 
That should be held against you. Ac-
cessing the internet should be deterred, 
not ignored. 
What I have to say is that the Na-
tional Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children released a report on the 2020 
data. There has been a 35-percent in-
crease in child sex abuse material in a 
single year, 29.3 million reports last 
year of people accessing child pornog-
raphy on the internet, and at least 85 
million images and files on the inter-
net. 
When it comes time to sentence these 
people, Judge Jackson will not impose 
additional punishment on the fact of 
the volume involved and the fact they 
are using the internet, the venue of 
choice. 
The more you download, the more 
you go to jail, is my view. I am going 
to work with Senator HAWLEY to cor-
rect these practices. I think she is 
making a terrible mistake by not en-
hancing sentences based on the volume 
because every click of the computer is 
destroying a life. We should be deter-
ring the use of the internet when it 
comes to child pornography. Judge 
Jackson chooses not to. When it comes 
to the volume, that should be held 
against you. The more you abuse chil-
dren, the more in your possession, the 
more you distribute, the longer you go 
to jail. 
The reason her numbers are so low is 
due to that sentencing methodology. I 
think, if we don’t fix this, we are mak-
ing the problem worse. I think her ap-
proach to this issue is absolutely 
wrong; it loses all deterrence. I will be 
watching like a hawk future nominees 
who are in the sentencing business to 
see if they follow this model. 
The model Judge Jackson has cre-
ated is one wherein the more you do, it 
doesn’t matter. The fact that you use 
the internet where all the child pornog-
raphy lies is not held against you, and 
I believe it should be. Every click, 
every download means you go to jail 
longer in the world that I want to cre-
ate. 
The other area of concern is Guanta-
namo Bay. Remember this? This is 9/11. 
Guantanamo Bay has been a place to 
house enemy combatants captured in 
the war on terror. Judge Jackson was a 
public defender, I think, for four or five 
GTMO detainees, and that is a noble 
thing. I have no problem with some-
body—a public defender anywhere in 
the country—defending very unpopular 
people, and people at GTMO deserve 
representation. 
What I found during this representa-
tion is that her amicus briefs in the de-
fense of GTMO detainees accused Presi-
dent Bush and his team of being war 
criminals. That is not defending some-
body charged or held as an enemy com-
batant as being part of the enemy 
force. That is an accusation against 
your own government that, I think, 
buys into the language of the left. 
You can vigorously defend anyone 
captured as an enemy combatant or 
who is potentially charged with a 
crime against terrorism. That is a 
noble thing. Yet, when you use the lan-
guage that was in her brief—and she 
said: ‘‘Well, I really don’t remember 
that’’—I have a hard time believing 
that you put your name on a brief that 
calls the President of the United States 
and his team war criminals. That is 
not about defending somebody; that is 
an activist approach to the war on ter-
ror. 
It goes further. In her legal briefs, 
she wanted to deny the United States 
the ability to hold GTMO detainees 
under the law of war indefinitely. 
There are about 37 or 38 GTMO detain-
ees still being held who have never 
been charged. We know, through the 
intel and the evidence, that they are 
hardened killers committed to the 
jihadist cause. Under the law of war, 
once their habeas petition has been re-
viewed by the Federal courts—where 
the courts agree with the government 
that the person is, in fact, an enemy 
combatant—under the law of war, 
there is no requirement to release him, 
but Judge Jackson took the position as 
an advocate that we could not hold 
them indefinitely, creating a dilemma 
whereby you have to charge them with 
a crime or let them go. 
I don’t consider these people crimi-
nals as much as warriors in the cause 
to destroy our way of life. If you 
choose to charge them with a crime, 
fine; but you don’t have to make that 
choice. The reason that there are 30- 
plus still in detention is we have cho-
sen—Republicans and Democrats—to 
hold these people off the battlefield. If 
we had accepted Judge Jackson’s legal 
reasoning, that tool would not have 
been available to us as a nation, and it 
would have compromised our ability to 
defend ourselves. 
I think that approach was the most 
extreme view of representation in this 
area, and I think it shows a lack of un-
derstanding of the war in which we are 
in. We are not fighting criminals. 
These are not wayward goat herders. 
These are people committed to the 
jihadist cause and would kill us all if 
they could. 
Before I leave GTMO, 31 percent of 
the people who have been detained 
since the beginning of the war have 
gone back to the fight—I will introduce 
that at the hearing next week—and 
some of the senior leadership of the 
current 
Taliban 
government 
were 
GTMO detainees who have now not 
only gone back to the fight but have 
actually gone back to serve in the 
Taliban government that is reining op-
pression on the Taliban people. 
So, to those who think this is a crime 
we are fighting, you are wrong. It is a 
war for the survival of good against 
evil. 
Immigration—in case you haven’t no-
ticed, this country is being invaded by 
illegal immigrants. Right after taking 
office, President Biden rolled back vir-
tually 
every 
policy 
of 
President 
Trump’s regarding asylum and deporta-
tion. He basically destroyed the regime 
created by President Trump that gave 
us the lowest number of illegal cross-
ings in this country in 30 or 40 years at 
the end of 2020. Now, every week, we 
are setting new records. 
Why? 
The policies that existed during the 
Trump administration worked. They 
are being reversed by President Biden, 
and we are being overwhelmed, and the 
worst is yet to come. If the Biden ad-
ministration—the 
CDC—does 
away 
with the ability to deport illegal immi-
grants under title 42 of the public 
health law, presenting a threat to 
COVID, then you will see the numbers 
go up even further. There will be thou-
sands—18,000 to 20,000 people a day— 
coming across our border from coun-
tries with low vaccination rates. So, 
when it comes to illegal immigration, 
policy matters. 
When Judge Jackson was a district 
court judge, there was a case brought 
by Make the Road New York, et al., v.

Secretary under President Trump. The 
group Make the Road New York was an 
Arabella activist group. This is kind of 
a holding company, for lack of a better 
word—an umbrella group—funded by 
George Soros and a bunch of other lib-
eral billionaires. This group in that 
chain, in receiving money from these 
folks, filed a lawsuit, arguing against 
the Trump decision to deport, under 
expedited immigration authority, peo-
ple who have been here 2 years or less. 
In changing the Obama policy and ac-
tually fully implementing the author-
ity given to the DHS Secretary, they 
decided to go the full 2 years. Anybody 
here 2 years and under in the category 
in question could be deported with ex-
pedited procedure—meaning, it was a 
quick turnaround. 
This was the authority given by the 
Congress to the DHS Director. Obama 
didn’t use that authority fully. Trump 
decided to do it. Make the Road New 
York, 
et 
al.—a 
bunch 
of 
liberal 
groups—sued the Trump policy change. 
Judge Jackson was the judge, and she 
overruled the Trump decision. The 
statute in question says that the Sec-
retary has the ‘‘sole and unreviewable 
discretion’’ to use expedited deporta-
tion for people here 2 years or less. The 
statute could not have been written 
any clearer. 
If you are looking for what an activ-
ist judge is all about, this is the case, 
exhibit A. 
The law was written in the most 
clear terms, saying the decision of the 
Secretary’s is unreviewable and solely 
in their hands when it comes to using 
expedited removal procedures for peo-
ple here 2 years or less. She ruled 
against the Trump administration. She 
basically said this was arbitrary and 
capricious; it reeked of bad faith; and 
it ‘‘[showed] contempt for the author-
ity that the Constitution’s Framers 
have vested in the judicial branch.’’ 
That contempt she is talking about 
was a congressional act. The congres-
sional act was designed to tell judges 
that the DHS Secretary has discretion 
in this area, solely and unreviewable. 
She found that concept offensive. In-
stead of following the plain letter of 
the law, she did legal gymnastics to 
find against the Trump administration. 
When she says the statute ‘‘[created] 
contempt for the authority that the 
Constitution’s Framers have vested in 
the judicial branch,’’ what she is say-
ing is, I will be damned if I am going to 
be limited by a congressional act that 
tells me I can’t do what I want to do. 
The plaintiff in that case was from 
the radical left. She ruled for them in 
spite of the plain meaning of the stat-
ute, and she was overturned by the DC 
Circuit court. 
The court said—and this is a fairly 
liberal court: 
There could hardly be a more definitive ex-
pression of Congressional intent to leave the 
decision about the scope of expedited re-
moval, within statutory bounds, to the Sec-
retary’s independent judgment. The ‘‘force-
ful phrase ‘sole and unreviewable discre-
tion’ ’’ by its exceptional terms, heralds 
Congress’s judgment to commit the decision 
exclusively to agency discretion. 
She ignored the plain meaning of the 
statute, the language of the statute, to 
get a result she wanted, and the DC 
District Court of Appeals said that 
there could hardly be a more defended 
expression of congressional intent. 
That is judicial activism on steroids, 
and it makes managing our immigra-
tion problem even worse when you 
have activist judges who ignore the law 
and take discretion away, given by 
Congress to the executive branch, be-
cause they don’t like the outcome. 
That is, in fact, the premier definition 
of judicial activism. I find, in her judg-
ing a desire to get an outcome and no 
matter what she has to do to get that 
outcome, she will pursue it. This is a 
case where you couldn’t have written a 
statute more clearly, and she did. She 
just went around it, got the results she 
wanted, and got slapped down on ap-
peal. 
Now, she is the first African-Amer-
ican female slated to go to the Su-
preme Court. She, however, is not the 
first African-American female who had 
potential to be on the Supreme Court. 
Janice Rogers Brown was nominated 
by President Bush 43 to be on the DC 
Circuit Court of Appeals—one of the 
premier appellate courts—like Judge 
Jackson was nominated to. She is from 
Alabama. She was the daughter and 
granddaughter of sharecroppers, grow-
ing up in Alabama during the Jim Crow 
era. She moved to California as a teen-
ager, and she wound up serving on the 
California Supreme Court. She was a 
single mother raising children. 
In June 2005, she was confirmed to 
the DC court in a 56-to-43 vote. That 
was after the Gang of 14 broke a fili-
buster by my Democratic colleagues 
against her and others. She was nomi-
nated in 2003, and her nomination was 
stalled for 2 years. 
Here is what Senator SCHUMER said: 
Judge Brown was the least worthy pick 
this president has made for the appellate 
court, and that’s based on her record. 
Senator DURBIN in 2005: 
One of the [President’s] most ideological 
and extreme judicial nominees. 
In 2005: 
If the President sends us a nominee who, 
like Janice Rogers Brown, believes that the 
New Deal was the triumph of a ‘‘socialist 
revolution,’’ there will be a fight. 
Here is what then-Senator Biden said 
about Janice Rogers Brown. Not only 
did he filibuster her, he said: ‘‘I can as-
sure you that would be a very, very dif-
ficult fight, and she probably would be 
filibustered’’ if she were nominated to 
the Supreme Court. 
So, to my Democratic colleagues, as 
you celebrate Judge Jackson’s poten-
tial ascension to the Court, as those of 
us on the committee who asked pene-
trating, relevant questions of Judge 
Jackson’s judicial philosophy, how she 
sentenced people and why—you know, 
the liberal media that is completely in 
the tank on issues like this sat on the 
sidelines and watched you, my Demo-
cratic colleagues, stop the ascension of 
an 
African-American 
conservative 
nominee by President Bush. When it 
came to her potential of being on the 
Supreme Court, you threatened to fili-
buster her. You considered her ideology 
unacceptable and too conservative. 
So if you are a conservative nominee 
of color, a woman, it is OK to use your 
ideology against you. If you question 
the ideology and the judging ability of 
a liberal African-American nominee, 
you are a racist. Those days are over 
for me. So I have very little respect for 
what is going on in modern America 
when it comes to judging. 
Miguel Estrada was nominated by 
President Bush 43—a highly qualified 
man, Hispanic—to be on the Court, and 
he fell victim to the wholesale fili-
buster of Bush nominees in the 2003 
era. He didn’t make it through the 
Gang of 8. Judge Janice Rogers Brown 
got on the Court—2 years delayed, and 
when she was being considered to go on 
the Court, Joe Biden, Senator Joe 
Biden, said she will be filibustered 
very, very likely. 
So we live in a world where, if you 
are a person of color, a woman, and you 
are conservative, everything is fair 
game. If you are a person of color and 
liberal, how dare anybody question or 
use the same standard against you that 
was used against the other nominees? I 
don’t accept that. 
Finally, about the hearing itself, to 
the liberal media, comparing this hear-
ing to Judge Kavanaugh’s is an abso-
lute offense. Nobody on the Republican 
side held information back, accusing 
Judge Brown of doing something that 
was either made up, not credible. No-
body questioned her high school an-
nual. Nobody took a bunch of garbage 
and made it seem like the nominee had 
been Bill Cosby in his teenage years. 
Crazy stuff. Offensive stuff. 
What we did ask Judge Jackson is, 
Why do you sentence the people the 
way you do? Explain the reasoning in 
the cases involving child pornography. 
We went after her judicial philosophy, 
and it had to be contentious because 
the judge seldom would answer a ques-
tion. But to me, if you are going to be 
nominated to the Supreme Court for a 
lifetime appointment, you should ex-
pect to be asked hard questions. You 
should not expect to have your life de-
stroyed. And if you don’t see a dif-
ference between the two hearings, then 
you are blinded by your desire to get 
an outcome. 
Here is where we are in 2022: The only 
person qualified to go to the Supreme 
Court as an African-American woman 
is a liberal. You can be equally quali-
fied as a conservative, but you need not 
apply because your ideology disquali-
fies you. That is not exactly the ad-
vancement I was hoping we would have 
in America in 2022. 
So, Judge Jackson, I will vote no. 
I find her sentencing methodology to 
reinforce and take deterrence of the 
most heinous offenses off the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1880 
March 31, 2022 
The statements she made during the 
sentencing hearings showed a tilted 
sense of compassion. I am sure she 
doesn’t like the behavior and feels 
sorry for the kids, but every time she 
had a chance to increase punishment 
for the volume of material in the hands 
of the perpetrators, she chose not to do 
that, and I think she should. Going to 
the internet, to her, and downloading a 
bunch of files was too easy to enhance 
punishment? Well, it is just too easy to 
destroy lives. 
So when it comes to immigration, it 
is the most egregious case I have ever 
seen, quite frankly, of a judge ignoring 
the plain meaning of the law to get a 
result they wanted. When it comes to 
the War on Terror, I think the position 
she wanted our country to take would 
make us less safe. The language of the 
left in her briefs of calling Bush a war 
criminal says more about the politics 
than it does the merit of the argument. 
So now, I know why Judge Jackson 
was the preferred pick of the radical 
left. Now, I know why they went after 
Michelle Childs, somebody I could have 
supported—even though she had been 
liberal—a highly qualified, sensible, 
commonsense person. Now, I know. 
Now, I understand better. And that is 
why I am voting no. 
To my Democratic colleagues, I will 
work with you when I can, but this is 
a bridge too far. 
Thank you. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened carefully to the presentation by 
my colleague and friend, Senator GRA-
HAM of South Carolina. I wanted to 
come to the floor to make it clear that 
he didn’t tell you the whole story. In 
fact, in some ways, he didn’t even get 
close. 
Who is this judge, Ketanji Brown 
Jackson? How could she even be con-
sidered for the Supreme Court if she is 
the preferred pick of the radical left? 
Well, let’s take a look at her back-
ground: an extraordinary story of a 
daughter of two public school teachers; 
the daughter of a father who decided he 
was going to go to law school, basically 
stopped working full time. Her mother 
supported the family. She was a little 
girl at the time. She remembers it well 
because there would be law books 
stacked on the kitchen table. She 
would come in as a little girl and bring 
her coloring books to sit next to her 
daddy while he was studying for law 
school. He went on to become a lawyer. 
Family members were policemen. One 
of her uncles turned out to be the chief 
of police in Miami. She grew up in a 
very ambitious, determined, orderly 
family, and she certainly had respect 
for her family ties to law enforcement. 
She was on the debate team in high 
school. One of the trips took her from 
Florida up to the campus of Harvard 
University. She was dazzled, believed 
that this just might be the answer to 
her dreams. 
She came back to her high school and 
sat down with her high school coun-
selor, who said to this young Black 
woman: Honey, you are shooting too 
high. I don’t want your heart to be bro-
ken. Think about other schools. Don’t 
think about that Harvard University 
school. 
Luckily, she ignored that advice, ap-
plied, and was accepted. 
She told the story before the hearing 
about being on the campus at Cam-
bridge, not sure that it was the right 
decision, looking around, seeing a 
much different world than the one she 
grew up in, a much different group of 
people than she was used to socializing 
with. She must have shown it in her 
face because as she was walking across 
the campus one day, an African-Amer-
ican woman saw her, looked at her, and 
said: Persevere. Persevere. 
Just that simple word captured ev-
erything for her, and she did. She per-
severed and completed her education at 
Harvard and went on to Harvard Law 
School. She was an outstanding stu-
dent at the law school, so much so that 
she became a clerk to the Federal dis-
trict court. She did such a good job, 
she was promoted to become a Federal 
circuit court clerk and then—the ulti-
mate prize for any graduating law stu-
dent in America—clerk to a Justice of 
the Supreme Court—Ketanji Brown 
Jackson—and what an irony that she 
worked for Justice Stephen Breyer, 
whose retirement has created the va-
cancy which she seeks. 
Along the way, she staffed the Sen-
tencing Commission. She worked in the 
Public Defender’s Office. She became a 
Federal district court judge, cleared by 
this committee, the Judiciary Com-
mittee. This was her fourth time before 
the committee. Each time she ap-
peared, there was bipartisan support, 
including the Senator who just spoke 
against her. Then, ultimately, the op-
portunity of a lifetime to fill a vacancy 
on the Supreme Court. 
For the hearing itself, first, I want to 
commend my Republican colleague 
CHUCK GRASSLEY. As chairman of the 
committee, a Democrat couldn’t be any 
luckier than to have sitting in the 
chair next to you CHUCK GRASSLEY. He 
is a gentleman. He is a strong, faithful 
Republican, but he is a gentleman. We 
were determined to make this hearing 
for this judicial nomination to the Su-
preme Court different than some that 
had gone before. 
I want to commend the Republicans 
on the committee. There are 11 of 
them. The majority of those Repub-
licans asked tough, probing questions, 
as they should. They never got per-
sonal. They never raised their voices. 
They were respectful throughout, the 
majority of them. I am sorry to say 
that in a few instances, there were ex-
ceptions on that side of the aisle. But 
I think the hearing, by and large, was 
a good hearing despite a few dif-
ferences, which I will note in a minute. 
At the end of the day, you could not 
help but leave that hearing and think 
you had just seen, you had just wit-
nessed a moment in history—not just 
the first African American to aspire to 
serve on the Supreme Court but also a 
pillar of strength during her hearing. 
They threw it at her in every direction. 
I can’t tell you how many people 
have come up to me everywhere I have 
gone since that hearing and said the 
same thing: How did you sit through 
that? How could you put up with that? 
And I thought, and I said to them: 
Think about her sitting in front of her 
husband and her daughters and some of 
the things that were said about her, 
things said again this morning on the 
Senate floor. She came out a pillar of 
strength, grace and dignity under pres-
sure. 
I looked up at that table several 
times and thought, Judge, if you stood 
up at this moment and said ‘‘Enough. I 
am taking my family, and we are out 
of here,’’ I would understand. But she 
never did. She never wavered. She was 
solid as a rock, and that is why it is my 
honor to support her and believe that 
she is going to make history. 
Some of the things they said were 
outrageous. This case they want to 
make about her sentencing guidelines 
when it comes to sex crimes involving 
children and child pornography—what 
did she say about it? She said they 
were horrible and despicable crimes. 
But she didn’t just say it before the 
committee when she was under assault. 
Listen to what she said in one of her 
cases, United States v. Hillie, a case in-
volving sexual misconduct toward chil-
dren. The true nature of these offenses, 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said, lies 
in how they affected the children who 
you tormented for nearly a decade 
when you lived on and off with their 
mother. That is a substantial portion 
of their childhood. These two children 
carried a burden no child should have 
to shoulder—the burden of protecting 
themselves from a man charged with 
their care but who instead exploited 
them. 
Then she went on to say: 
This family has been torn apart— 
she said to the defendant— 
by your criminal actions. You saw it on the 
faces of those women. You heard it in their 
voices. And the impact of your acts on those 
very real victims who are still struggling to 
recover to this day makes your crimes 
among the most serious criminal offenses 
that this Court has ever sentenced. 
Does that sound like she is soft on 
crime? Does that sound like she didn’t 
remember she is a mother of daughters 
who cared for the impact those crimi-
nals had on the children and the fam-
ily? Not in any way whatsoever. 
You would draw a much different 
conclusion if you just listened to the 
arguments being made recently here on 
the floor, and it would be an unfair 
conclusion. 
The bottom line, as far as I am con-
cerned, is this: What they have left out 
in the presentation is critical to the 
very truth of their allegations. Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson is in the main-
stream of sentencing when it comes to 
these cases. Seventy to eighty percent

of Federal judges divert from the 
guidelines as she has in some cases. 
And, let me add, her accusers have 
been voting for Federal judges proposed 
by President Trump right and left who 
do exactly the same thing she does. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD a 
New York Times article of March 25, 
2022, 
entitled 
‘‘Jackson’s 
Critics 
Backed Judges With Like Rulings.’’ 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Mar. 24, 2022] 
JACKSON’S CRITICS BACKED JUDGES WITH LIKE 
RULINGS 
(By Linda Qiu) 
WASHINGTON.—Several Republican senators 
repeatedly and misleadingly suggested dur-
ing this week’s Supreme Court confirmation 
hearings that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
had given uncommonly lenient sentences to 
felons convicted of child sex abuse crimes. 
But all of the Republican critics had pre-
viously voted to confirm judges who had 
given out prison terms below prosecutor rec-
ommendations, the very bar they accused 
Judge Jackson of failing to clear. 
Just 30 percent of offenders who possessed 
or shared images of child sex abuse received 
a sentence within the range suggested by 
nonbinding federal guidelines in the 2019 fis-
cal year, and 59 percent received a sentence 
below the guideline range. And in general, it 
is not uncommon for judges to impose short-
er sentences than what prosecutors have rec-
ommended. 
‘‘I listed these seven cases in which you 
had discretion and you did not follow the 
prosecutor’s recommendation or the sen-
tencing guidelines,’’ Senator Josh Hawley, 
Republican of Missouri, said at Judge Jack-
son’s hearing on Tuesday. ‘‘I’m questioning 
how you used your discretion in these 
cases.’’ 
Mr. Hawley’s point was echoed by three of 
his Republican colleagues: Senators Lindsey 
Graham of South Carolina, Tom Cotton of 
Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Cruz 
said the sentences imposed by Judge Jackson 
in cases involving images of child sex abuse 
were 47.2 percent less than the prosecutor’s 
recommendations on average. 
‘‘You always were under the recommenda-
tion of the prosecutor,’’ Mr. Graham told the 
judge on Wednesday. ‘‘I think you’re doing it 
wrong, and every judge who does what you’re 
doing is making it easier for the children to 
be exploited.’’ 
But Mr. Hawley, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cotton 
and Mr. Cruz all voted to confirm judges 
nominated by President Donald J. Trump to 
appeals courts even though those nominees 
had given out sentences lighter than pros-
ecutor recommendations in cases involving 
images of child sex abuse. Mr. Graham had 
also voted to confirm Judge Jackson to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Co-
lumbia Circuit in 2021 in spite of the sen-
tencing decisions she had made as a district 
judge. 
In 2017, Judge Ralph R. Erickson was con-
firmed by a 95-to-l vote to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, with Mr. Cot-
ton, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Graham voting in the 
affirmative. (Mr. Hawley was not yet a sen-
ator.) While serving as a district court judge 
in North Dakota, Judge Erickson imposed 
sentences shorter than the prosecutor’s rec-
ommendations in nine cases involving child 
sex abuse imagery from 2009 to 2017, aver-
aging 19 percent lower. 
In the case with the greatest discrepancy— 
in which a 68-year-old man pleaded guilty to 
possessing and transporting such illicit ma-
terials—prosecutors asked for 151 months 
and Judge Erickson imposed a 96-month sen-
tence. 
Judge Amy J. St. Eve was confirmed by a 
91-to-0 vote in 2018 to the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Seventh Circuit. While serving 
as a district court judge in Illinois, Judge St. 
Eve imposed lighter sentences than pros-
ecutor recommendations in two such cases. 
In United States v. Conrad, she sentenced a 
man who transported images of child sexual 
abuse to 198 months, 45 percent less than the 
prosecutor’s recommendation of 360 months. 
All four Republican senators voted to con-
firm Judge Joseph F. Bianco to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 
2019. Previously, as a district court judge in 
New York, Judge Bianco sentenced three de-
fendants to prison terms shorter than what 
prosecutors had sought. 
At a 2013 hearing for a 25-year-old defend-
ant who possessed and distributed illicit ma-
terials, Judge Bianco stated that the court 
had ‘‘discretion’’ to impose such sentences 
and spoke of ‘‘mitigating circumstances’’— 
an echo of what Judge Jackson repeatedly 
told the senators during this week’s hear-
ings. The defendant received a 60-month pris-
on term, while prosecutors had asked for ‘‘a 
sentence above the 60 months.’’ 
‘‘The guidelines here are just way dis-
proportionate under the facts of this case, 
and I don’t view them as particularly helpful 
in this case.’’ Judge Bianco said at the time. 
‘‘I disagree with the government that this 
case is sort of in the heartland of normal 
cases. There are a number of mitigating fac-
tors in this case that I believe are compel-
ling.’’ 
Most recently, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Cruz and 
Mr. Hawley voted to confirm Judge Andrew 
L. Brasher to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the 11th Circuit in 2020. (Mr. Graham was not 
present for the vote.) As a district court 
judge in Alabama, Judge Brasher had sen-
tenced a defendant to 84 months in prison, 
below the prosecutor recommendation of 170 
months. 
In a 2019 hearing before he issued the sen-
tence, Judge Brasher noted that ‘‘one of the 
things that I’m required by law to evaluate 
and consider with respect to’’ the defendant 
‘‘is disparities between offenders who are 
similarly situated.’’ 
That, too, was similar to an explanation 
that Judge Jackson gave for her sentencing 
decisions. 
‘‘Judges all over the country are grappling 
with how to apply this guideline under these 
circumstances,’’ she told Mr. Hawley on 
Wednesday. ‘‘The judge is not just evalu-
ating what the government says in these 
cases. In every criminal case, a judge has to 
take into account all sorts of factors.’’ 
Mr. DURBIN. It tells a story, and the 
story is very clear. We have a situation 
in this country where we have not up-
graded the child pornography and sex-
ual 
misconduct 
statutes 
in 
years. 
Across the board, 70 to 80 percent of 
sentences by Federal judges take the 
same position as Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson. These so-called deviations 
from the guidelines have become com-
monplace. As I said, the overwhelming 
majority of Federal judges are doing 
this. 
Well, is there a problem? There is. 
But the problem is that we have not 
upgraded the statute. We bear responsi-
bility for this. The decision was made 
before the Supreme Court that these 
guidelines would not be mandatory. It 
was a decision joined by Antonin 
Scalia—the originalist, the conserv-
ative. It put the burden back on Con-
gress, and we have not picked up that 
responsibility. 
So you say to yourself: Well, if she 
were so soft on crime, it surely would 
have shown up in other places. Well, let 
me tell you what happened. The Amer-
ican Bar Association did a review of 
her career as a prosecutor, as a de-
fender, on the bench. They interviewed 
250 
individuals—judges, 
prosecutors, 
defense lawyers, other counsel who 
worked with her. 
And I asked, pointblank, Judge Ann 
Williams, who led this investigation by 
the ABA: Did you hear from anyone 
who said she was soft on crime; that 
she somehow was not in the norm when 
it came to sentencing? 
None. Not one. Two hundred fifty 
people interviewed, and not one came 
up with it. 
All we have heard against her has 
come out of the mouths of three or four 
people on the committee, and that is it 
because there is no record for it. 
Well, how did the American Bar As-
sociation grade her when it was all said 
and done? Unanimously ‘‘well quali-
fied.’’ Unanimously ‘‘well qualified.’’ It 
doesn’t sound like the same person just 
described, does it, because it isn’t. 
What you have heard on the floor here 
is a mischaracterization of her record, 
and I am sorry to say it is unfair. And 
I wish it hadn’t been part of the record 
today. 
What about Guantanamo? Well, I 
have some serious differences with the 
Senator from South Carolina about 
Guantanamo. Hundreds of detainees 
have been sent to Guantanamo since 
the War on Terror began. Many of 
them should have been there, but hun-
dreds and hundreds of them have been 
released by Presidents, Republican and 
Democratic. We are now down to 39 de-
tainees. We are spending over $10 mil-
lion for each one of them each year at 
Guantanamo Bay. 
And when it comes to the resolution 
of who was responsible for 9/11, the 
families have come and testified before 
us. They have waited over 20 years, and 
they still don’t have an answer. They 
understand that the approach at Guan-
tanamo Bay is not leading to justice, 
and it is not answering the basic fac-
tual questions. 
So what is her situation? Why would 
she dare to call the Republican Presi-
dent of the United States a war crimi-
nal? What was she thinking? Well, it 
sounds like a terrible charge until you 
read the facts. 
The facts were she presented a brief, 
and the brief referred to a body of law 
known as the Alien Tort Statute. And 
the person she was representing in this 
brief was arguing that he was tortured 
and mistreated at Guantanamo Bay. So 
he filed a claim under the Alien Tort 
Statute. When you do that, you sue the 
President of the United States and the 
Secretary of Defense. They were the 
named defendants. That included Presi-
dent Bush.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1882 
March 31, 2022 
What the Senator from South Caro-
lina failed to disclose was that, as that 
case was winding its way through, the 
administration changed, and if there 
was an allegation of a war crime 
against President Bush, it was the 
same allegation that was made when 
the administration changed and the 
name of the defendant changed to 
Barack Obama. 
To argue that this was a personal 
charge against the President of the 
United States as a war criminal is a 
gross exaggeration and unfair on its 
face. The named defendants were re-
quired under the Alien Tort Statute for 
the allegations that were made. That 
wasn’t her decision; that was the deci-
sion of Congress to write the specifics 
of the Alien Tort Statute. 
The third point I want to make is im-
migration. Yes, we have challenges in 
immigration. I think we all know it. 
But to blame her and say that she is 
somehow responsible for the invasion— 
you saw the crowd of people coming 
across the border—is really unfair. 
What happened was there was a law-
suit filed challenging a Trump decision 
on policy, and she was asked to rule on 
it. And she ruled in one direction. The 
appeal was taken, and she was reversed 
at the circuit court. 
Now, according to the Senator who 
just made the presentation, evidence 
she is in the pocket of the radical left 
when it comes to immigration, evi-
dence that George Soros somehow is 
controlling her decisions, is prepos-
terous. The fact of the matter is, if you 
look at almost 600 decisions handed 
down by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, 
you will find a small, small percentage 
that were actually reversed. 
And if you are looking for a second 
case to build the theory that she is on 
the radical left, I don’t even think you 
found the first one. She has a balanced 
approach. She has ruled for and against 
Democratic and Republican Presidents. 
She has shown the kind of balance we 
expect on the Supreme Court. 
I would say this notion that somehow 
Joe Biden has chosen someone who is 
radical is a shame. She is not. She is as 
solid as they come, and her testimony 
and her appearance before the com-
mittee proved that over and over 
again. 
I also want to say I have nothing 
against the South Carolina judge who 
was in the finals but wasn’t chosen by 
the President. In fact, President Biden 
has asked that she be promoted from 
the Federal district court to the Fed-
eral circuit court, and I would like to 
get that done as quickly as we can. I 
think Judge Childs is well deserving of 
that opportunity. She certainly is a 
good jurist. 
But the choice by President Biden 
was clear, and it was the right choice. 
These charges that somehow she is soft 
on crime because she is an African- 
American woman and she was a public 
defender belie the actually record of 
this woman. 
We should all be judged on our 
records. This notion that we are asked 
to identify ourselves by labels—we 
know that story, the 100 of us who sit 
on this side of the Capitol in the Sen-
ate Chamber. We are attached to labels 
which we embrace and some we don’t 
embrace, but most people who are fair 
will say: I am not going to judge you 
by your label; I am going to judge you 
by your record. 
If you judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
by her record—written opinions, the 
fact that this was the fourth time she 
appeared before the Judiciary Com-
mittee and had been approved the three 
previous times, serving on the Sen-
tencing Commission and so many other 
things—you know that it is an out-
standing and stellar record, but you 
know it almost has to be. If you want 
to be the first, you have to be the best. 
She is the best. 
Despite some of the things that have 
been thrown at her today and in other 
places, the American people came out 
of that hearing and felt better and 
stronger about her nomination than 
before the hearing began. It is evidence 
of the strengths that she brings to this 
nomination and the value that she will 
bring to the Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be permitted 
to speak for up to 10 minutes, Senator 
MURPHY for up to 12 minutes, and Sen-
ator GRASSLEY for up to 10 minutes 
prior to the scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
2023 FARM BILL 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it has 
now been more than 3 years since the 
2018 farm bill, and it is time to start 
thinking about the next one. The 
House Agriculture Committee has al-
ready begun holding hearings on the 
2023 farm bill, and I am hoping that the 
Senate Agriculture Committee will 
begin holding hearings soon as well. 
Agriculture is the lifeblood of our 
economy in South Dakota, and advo-
cating for farmers and ranchers is one 
of my top priorities here in the Senate. 
I am fortunate enough to be a longtime 
member of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee, which gives me an impor-
tant platform from which to address 
the needs of South Dakota ag pro-
ducers. 
During my time in Congress, I have 
worked on four farm bills, and I am 
particularly proud of the nearly 20 
measures I was able to get included in 
the 2018 farm bill. Among other things, 
I authored provisions to improve the 
Agriculture Risk Coverage Program, 
improve the accuracy of the U.S. 
Drought Monitor, and include soil 
health as a research priority at the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
I was also able to secure a number of 
improvements of the Conservation Re-
serve Program, including a provision to 
increase the CRP acreage cap, in-
creased flexibility for acres enrolled in 
CRP, and cost sharing for fencing and 
water distribution practices on CRP- 
enrolled acres. 
I also secured approval for a new, 
short-term alternative to CRP—the 
Soil Health and Income Protection 
Program—to provide an option for 
farmers who don’t want to take their 
land out of production for the 10 to 15 
years required under the Conservation 
Reserve Program. 
And I was able to secure important 
provisions to increase the approval 
rate of Livestock Indemnity Program 
applications for death losses due to 
weather-related diseases. 
I would never have been able to get 
all this done without the input of 
South Dakota farmers and ranchers. 
These provisions were a direct result of 
extensive conversations with South 
Dakota ag producers that provided in-
sight into the challenges that they 
were facing and what improvements 
could be made to make things easier in 
this demanding way of life. 
As I look to the 2023 farm bill, I will 
once again be relying on South Dakota 
farmers and ranchers to lend their 
firsthand knowledge to this effort. In 
fact, last Friday, I held the first of a 
series of roundtables I am planning to 
hold to hear from South Dakota agri-
cultural producers. Friday’s roundtable 
focused on the commodity and crop in-
surance titles of the farm bill, and I 
was grateful to be able to hear from 
representatives of the South Dakota 
Farm Bureau; South Dakota corn, soy-
bean, and wheat producers; as well as 
crop insurance industry representa-
tives. 
I 
will 
be 
holding 
additional 
roundtables to cover other farm bill 
priorities, including livestock, con-
servation, and forestry issues. And, of 
course, I will continue to rely on the 
many informal conversations I have 
with South Dakota ag producers as I 
travel around the State. 
There is nothing worse than having 
‘‘experts’’ in Washington come in and 
dictate to the real-world experts: the 
farmers and ranchers who spend every 
day producing the food that feeds our 
Nation. And my goal is always to make 
sure that any farm legislation is di-
rectly informed by farmers and ranch-
ers in South Dakota and around the 
country. I already have a list of issues 
that I am looking to see addressed in 
the next farm bill, and I plan to refine 
that list over the coming months in my 
conversations with South Dakota ag 
producers. 
One thing that emerged clearly from 
Friday’s roundtable is the importance 
of the farm safety net and the critical 
role of crop insurance and commodity 
programs. Agriculture Risk Coverage 
and Price Loss Coverage payments, 
which help offset losses when prices for 
agricultural products drop, are not al-
ways proving sufficient, particularly 
with our current high inflation, which 
has sent the price of inputs like fer-
tilizer soaring. 
As I mentioned earlier, I was able to 
secure improvements to the Agri-
culture Risk Coverage Program in the

2018 farm bill, and I plan to seek fur-
ther commodity title program im-
provements in the 2023 farm bill. 
I also want to secure further im-
provements to the Conservation Re-
serve Program. From my conversations 
with South Dakota ag producers, it is 
clear that we need to make changes to 
ensure that CRP continues to be an ef-
fective option for producers and land-
owners. In fact, last week, I introduced 
the Conservation Reserve Program Im-
provement Act, which I will work to 
get included in the 2023 farm bill. 
Among other things, my legislation 
would make CRP grazing a more at-
tractive option by providing cost-share 
payments for all CRP practices for the 
establishment of grazing infrastruc-
ture, including fencing and water dis-
tribution. And it would increase the 
annual payment limit for CRP, which 
hasn’t been changed since 1985, to help 
account for inflation and the increase 
that we have seen in land values. This 
would expand the enrollment options 
available to landowners to ensure the 
program effectively serves farmers and 
ranchers, as well as conservation goals. 
The Conservation Program Improve-
ment Act is the first of multiple bills I 
plan to introduce in the runup to the 
2023 farm bill to address the concerns 
of farmers and ranchers. 
The one issue I have been working on 
extensively over the past year is the 
challenges facing livestock producers, 
particularly cattle producers. I will 
work to make sure the farm bill will 
provide resources to help them face 
these challenges. 
The life of a farmer and rancher is a 
challenging one. The work often starts 
long before the Sun rises and concludes 
long after the Sun has set. The labor 
can be backbreaking, not to mention 
the deep uncertainty that goes along 
with this existence. There are few 
other industries so subject to the 
whims of the weather, which can wipe 
out an entire crop or herd in a very 
short period of time. 
I am profoundly grateful for all those 
who have chosen and continued this 
way of life, often for generations. The 
food we eat every day depends upon 
their work, and our country would not 
long survive without them. I am proud 
to have the honor of representing 
South Dakota’s farmers and ranchers 
here in the Senate, and I will continue 
to work every day to ensure that their 
needs are addressed. I look forward to 
ensuring that the 2023 farm bill reflects 
the priorities of South Dakota farmers 
and ranchers and farmers and ranchers 
around our great country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Today, I come to 
the Senate floor to discuss the Traf-
ficking Victims Protection Reauthor-
ization Act. This has been introduced 
in the House and now introduced in the 
Senate by this Senator and by my col-
league and friend, Senator FEINSTEIN. 
This bill is a product of bipartisan 
work and much collaboration. I also 
want to thank Senators CORNYN and 
KLOBUCHAR, who are true leaders in 
this area and also introduced their 
trafficking legislation this week. I look 
forward to continuing to work with 
those two Senators, as well, on this 
issue. 
Many Americans tend to view human 
slavery as a thing of the past. We read 
about it in our history books and col-
lectively cringe at the concept of such 
injustice. Unfortunately, however, the 
reality is that human slavery is alive 
and well, even today, in the form of sex 
and labor trafficking. According to the 
State Department’s annual Trafficking 
in Persons Report, human trafficking 
is a $150 billion business worldwide. 
Through deception, through threats, 
through violence, the perpetrators of 
these crimes will do whatever—what-
ever—it takes to turn a profit at their 
victims’ expense. 
With the introduction of this bill, we 
are acting as a voice for those human 
trafficking 
victims 
in 
the 
United 
States who cannot speak for them-
selves. To combat this crime within 
our borders, we have addressed the 
scourge on multiple fronts. The bill we 
have championed would extend several 
key victims’ services programs that 
were established under the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Act. It would pro-
mote screening of human trafficking 
victims, enhance training for Federal 
investigators, and start a pilot pro-
gram for young people at high risk of 
being trafficked. 
Our bill also includes the Survivor’s 
Bill of Rights, a bill I developed with 
survivors 
and 
an 
advocate 
named 
Amanda Nguyen, which encourages 
States to ensure that survivors have, 
at minimum, the rights guaranteed to 
survivors under Federal law. 
Fighting for victims has been one of 
my top priorities as chairman and now 
ranking member of Senate Judiciary. I 
consider it a privilege to shape the law 
to ensure that trafficking victims re-
ceive necessary services. I also take 
pride in helping law enforcement and 
prosecutors hold the perpetrators ac-
countable for these selfish acts. 
Lastly, this bill has the support of 
the National District Attorneys Asso-
ciation, 
Rights4Girls, 
Shared 
Hope 
International, Covenant House, the Na-
tional Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children, the Rape, Abuse & Incest Na-
tional Network, and the National Cen-
ter on Sexual Exploitation. I am grate-
ful for all of these groups and the im-
portant work that they do. 
This bipartisan bill is a strong start, 
and, of course, the work doesn’t stop 
with a single piece of legislation. I look 
forward to marking this bill up in the 
Judiciary Committee and getting it 
signed into law. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. President, on another relatively 
short matter, as well, something I 
come to the floor frequently to speak 
about and something I waited through-
out last year to see if the Democrats’ 
approach to prescription drugs was 
going to become law—and it doesn’t 
look to me like that route is going to 
be successful. 
So I continually bring up another 
piece of legislation that I am working 
on with Senator WYDEN. It is a bill 
that says very clearly that this Sen-
ator—and I think I speak for many, 
many Senators—that we want lower 
prescription drugs now. I said that in 
the 
Finance 
Committee 
hearing 
2 
weeks ago, and I say it again: I want 
lower prescription drugs now. 
What are we waiting for? We have a 
bipartisan prescription drug package 
called Wyden-Grassley that will save 
seniors $72 billion and the taxpayers 
$95 billion. 
Senator WYDEN said during the Fi-
nance Committee’s most recent drug 
pricing hearing that ‘‘there is no ques-
tion that the committee came’’ for-
ward—I am going to start this quote 
over again: 
There is no question that the committee 
came together in the last Congress and came 
up with a number of constructive bipartisan 
reforms. Period. Full stop. 
Why aren’t we then advancing this 
bipartisan bill? What is the majority 
waiting for? 
One of my colleagues on the other 
side tweeted this: 
POTUS has the authority to lower drug 
prices all on his own—he should use it. 
The Congressional Progressive Cau-
cus is calling for this same thing, as 
well. 
And then in the Washington Post, I 
read this headline: 
Advocates seek other pathways to lower 
drug prices. 
Far-left groups are pushing President 
Biden to bypass Congress and exert ex-
ecutive authority. Is that some sort of 
statement that we are giving up on the 
legislative path? Why would we, in 
Congress, not move ahead? It is not 
like all options for legislation have 
been exhausted. 
The majority has spent 15 months at-
tempting to pass their partisan pre-
scription drug bill. It has gone no-
where. It doesn’t have 60 votes. But 
that is not the only option. Has the 
Democratic majority given up on low-
ering prescription drug prices and is 
counting on doing it only by Executive 
order? Are they saying they have to do 
it in a way where only Democrats get 
credit or not do anything at all? Do 
Democrats really want to help seniors 
or would they rather have a campaign 
issue? 
The longer we wait, patients and tax-
payers are going to continue to pay 
those high prices, and for some fami-
lies, that is a suffering position to be 
in. 
Let’s work to advance a bipartisan 
prescription drug bill that can pass 
with 60-plus votes. We can do it today. 
It is already negotiated and ready to 
go. I will work with anyone who wants 
to pass the bipartisan Wyden-Grassley 
bill. Just give me a call.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1884 
March 31, 2022 
I said something about last year, 
that you had to sit around and wait for 
the Democrats to get something done 
on a totally partisan basis. I don’t say 
that they didn’t work hard to get a bill 
passed that would have reduced pre-
scription drug prices. 
But I just didn’t sit around all of 
2021. In the past 15 months, I want to 
give you some of the things that I have 
been doing to try to sell a bipartisan 
bill. I spoke with President Biden’s 
White House staff—although I did have 
a short conversation with President 
Biden himself. I met with Speaker 
PELOSI. I met with Leader MCCARTHY. I 
had a phone call with HHS Secretary 
Becerra. I met with the 10 Democrats 
who were wise to this issue that you 
can’t pass a bipartisan prescription 
drug bill. 
These 10 House Democrats wrote to 
the Speaker, way last summer, want-
ing a bipartisan prescription drug pric-
ing bill. I met with not all 10 of them, 
but I will bet I met with at least 5 of 
them, and they were receptive to doing 
what I am doing. It doesn’t mean they 
were receptive to doing it exactly the 
way I wanted to do it, but they were re-
ceptive to working in a bipartisan way. 
Then I met with the Republican and 
Democrat group that is called the 
Problem Solvers Caucus Healthcare 
Working Group. 
PETER
WELCH, a Democrat from 
Vermont, has been on top of this issue 
for years and years. I had breakfast 
with him. 
I met with Congresswoman MCMOR-
RIS RODGERS because she is the top Re-
publican in the House dealing with this 
issue. 
I met with Senators SINEMA and CAR-
PER and other rank-and-file Members 
of Congress. 
While Democrats talk about lowering 
drug costs, they haven’t made any 
progress. The only bipartisan progress 
that has been made on drug pricing has 
been under Republican leadership. If 
Republicans take control of the Senate 
next Congress, Republicans will be low-
ering prescription drug prices. We 
shouldn’t have to wait another 8, 9 
months. And who knows who will con-
trol the next Congress in the first 
place. We don’t have to wait a whole 
year. Let’s lower prescription drug 
prices today. 
I yield the floor. 
TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to join Senator GRASSLEY 
in introducing the Trafficking Victims 
Prevention and Protection Reauthor-
ization Act of 2022. 
Human trafficking and modern slav-
ery are abhorrent crimes that are a 
scourge on our country and the world. 
In 2022, there are an estimated 40 mil-
lion victims of human trafficking and 
modern 
slavery 
worldwide. 
These 
crimes 
generate 
approximately 
$150,000,000,000 of revenue annually. 
Perpetrators of human trafficking 
prey on vulnerable and marginalized 
communities, which disproportionally 
impacts women and girls, migrants, 
people of color, and LGBT individuals. 
According 
to 
Polaris—the 
anti- 
human trafficking organization that 
runs the National Human Trafficking 
Hotline—in 2021, the hotline was con-
tacted directly over 13,000 times by vic-
tims and survivors of human traf-
ficking in the United States. In the 
last 2 years, since the beginning of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, the hotline has 
had a 60 percent increase in total con-
tacts. 
There is also evidence that labor 
trafficking in the agricultural industry 
may have increased during the pan-
demic. In June 2021, Polaris released a 
report finding that, ‘‘[a]mong reported 
labor trafficking victims, there was 
more than a 70 percent increase in 
those who held H2–A visas.’’ 
This is unconscionable, and more 
must be done to combat human traf-
ficking. That is why Senator GRASSLEY 
and I have introduced the Trafficking 
Victims Prevention and Protection Re-
authorization Act of 2022. 
This bill builds on the pillars of anti- 
human trafficking policy—prevention, 
protection, prosecution, and partner-
ship—in order to protect victims and 
rid the world of this heinous crime. 
This bill aims to prevent human traf-
ficking by requiring enhanced anti- 
human trafficking education and train-
ing for all Federal departments and 
agencies. 
It would also require all Federal con-
tractors to certify that they do not en-
gage in the trafficking of persons and 
that no human trafficking occurred in 
that contractor’s supply chain. The bill 
also encourages large private corpora-
tions to make the same types of certifi-
cations. 
I am particularly proud of how this 
bill advances the goal of protecting 
victims and survivors of human traf-
ficking. This bill not only reauthorizes 
existing grant programs, but it also 
creates a new grant for education and 
employment training for survivors of 
human trafficking. 
The bill establishes a pilot program 
that provides services—such as edu-
cation 
and 
employment 
programs, 
housing, and substance use disorder 
treatment—for 
youth 
who 
face 
a 
heightened risk of trafficking. 
And to continue learning how to best 
support victims and survivors of traf-
ficking, the bill calls for a study on the 
accessibility of mental health and sub-
stance use disorder services for sur-
vivors. 
This bill also enhances the Federal 
Government’s 
ability 
to 
prosecute 
human traffickers. 
Importantly, it bars government offi-
cials investigating human trafficking 
cases from engaging in sexual contact 
with victims during the course of the 
investigation. And it further provides 
protection from retaliation and intimi-
dation and creates a new penalty for 
obstructing human trafficking inves-
tigations. 
Finally, the bill will facilitate part-
nerships by creating a new grant pro-
gram that encourages collaboration be-
tween State child welfare and juvenile 
justice agencies. This is important be-
cause youth involved in the juvenile 
justice and child welfare system face a 
heightened risk of human trafficking. 
Additionally, the bill promotes co-
ordination at the Federal level by en-
couraging 
enhanced 
communication 
and data sharing between State and 
Federal 
agencies 
and 
across 
the 
branches of government. 
This bill will strengthen our govern-
ment’s response to human trafficking 
as well as the services that we provide 
to victims and survivors. 
I am hopeful that we will be able to 
pass this bipartisan bill this Congress. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
passage of this important, comprehen-
sive legislation to protect trafficking 
victims. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, the 
process of confirming a Supreme Court 
Justice is supposed to be lengthy, 
thoughtful, rigorous. I am grateful to 
the Presiding Officer and Chairman 
DURBIN for doing it right with Judge 
Brown Jackson. 
Judge Jackson has answered hours of 
questions about her judicial philos-
ophy, why she made certain decisions, 
why she represented certain clients, 
how her background has shaped her 
world view. Nearly every detail of her 
professional and personal life has been 
and will continue to be interrogated 
publicly as she goes through the final 
stages of this process. 
But a strange thing is going to hap-
pen when Judge Jackson finally takes 
her seat on the Supreme Court. She 
will, after all of this review and scru-
tiny, become effectively immune from 
ethics standards. 
Why is that? Because every Federal 
judge—circuit judges, district judges, 
court of international trade judges, 
court of Federal claims judges, bank-
ruptcy 
judges, 
magistrate 
judges— 
every Federal judge is bound by a code 
of ethics in order to safeguard the judi-
ciary’s neutrality and transparency— 
all Federal judges, except for nine: the 
Supreme Court. 
It is not because the Supreme Court 
is so highly regarded by the American 
people. In fact, the opposite is true. 
Trust in the institution’s reputation 
is in rapid decline right now. According 
to a recent C–SPAN poll, only 30 per-
cent—about 37 percent, actually—of 
likely voters believe that the Supreme 
Court acts in a ‘‘serious and constitu-
tionally sound manner.’’ 
In a democracy that prides itself on a 
fair and independent judiciary, that is 
unacceptable. It is worrying, but it is 
not surprising. Recent revelations sur-
rounding Justice Thomas and his wife’s 
involvement in the events of January 6 
have finally brought attention that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1885 
March 31, 2022 
those standards we try to uphold dur-
ing the confirmation process quickly 
disappear upon confirmation. 
Now, 
this 
isn’t 
some 
new 
phe-
nomenon. We have seen Justices—both 
liberal and conservative—promote po-
litical fundraisers, speak at partisan 
events, fail to recuse themselves from 
cases with pretty clear conflicts of in-
terest. And if the past is prologue—the 
recent incident that has gained a lot of 
attention regarding Justice Thomas’s 
family—it won’t be the last. 
Now, I first introduced a bill that 
would require the Supreme Court to 
adopt a code of ethics 10 years ago. And 
I have reintroduced a version of that 
bill in every Congress since. 
The majority of Americans agrees 
with me: There is absolutely no reason 
why the Supreme Court shouldn’t be 
subject to a code of conduct just like 
every other Federal judge. 
But the Court disagrees. John Rob-
erts said in 2011 when he was asked 
about this: 
The Court has no reason to adopt a 
code of conduct as its definitive source 
of ethical guidance. 
Well, it has a reason now. And to be 
clear, I am not talking about a code of 
conduct that is written by Congress. 
Instead, my legislation would require 
the Judicial Conference to create a 
binding code of conduct that applies to 
all Federal judges and Justices, includ-
ing those on the Supreme Court. 
It is a simple step that would im-
prove transparency, enforce account-
ability, and restore some lost faith in 
the institution. And, frankly, because 
of that diminishing faith, it is in the 
Court’s interest to do everything pos-
sible to try to help rebuild public con-
fidence. 
During 
Justice 
Kavanaugh’s 
con-
firmation process, Justice Kagan put it 
best. She said: 
The Court’s strength as an institution of 
American governance depends on people be-
lieving [it has] a certain kind of legitimacy, 
on people believing it is not simply an exten-
sion of politics, that its decision-making has 
a kind of integrity to it. 
If people don’t believe that, they 
have no reason to accept what the 
Court does. Justice Kagan said it well. 
And right now, that belief is tee-
tering dangerously close to the edge. 
The spouse of a Supreme Court Justice 
was involved in an effort to organize a 
coup and overthrow of a democrat-
ically elected President of the United 
States. That is extraordinary. That is 
not normal. It should not be treated as 
just another flavor of legitimate polit-
ical action, and the fact that there is 
no clear binding code of conduct that 
addresses this kind of behavior and no 
clear standards of recusal for Supreme 
Court Justices that the American peo-
ple can see and trust is just unaccept-
able. 
I think that my Democratic and Re-
publican colleagues can agree on this, 
the American people deserve to know 
that our Supreme Court Justices are 
being held to the highest standards 
whether they be Justices appointed by 
Democratic Presidents or Justices ap-
pointed by Republican Presidents. It is 
not enough for us to just trust the 
Court any longer to self-enforce a se-
cret internal code of ethics. 
The highest Court in the land cannot 
be exempt from the standards that we 
hold every other Federal judge to. I am 
glad that this piece of legislation has 
gained additional cosponsors just over 
the course of the last week. I hope that 
it eventually becomes a bipartisan 
piece of legislation, and I would urge 
my colleagues to join me in holding the 
Court to account. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. President, finally, I know votes 
are pending, but I am also coming to 
the floor to request, as I will in a mo-
ment, unanimous consent for the nomi-
nation and approval of Javier Ramirez 
to be Director of the Federal Mediation 
and Conciliation Service. 
I would guess that not a lot of my 
colleagues know much about the Fed-
eral Mediation and Conciliation Serv-
ice, and that is because we normally 
don’t have to have a debate over the 
confirmation of its Director on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate. 
The Agency is an independent one 
that has been in place since 1947. Its 
mission is to preserve and promote 
labor management peace and coopera-
tion by providing mediation and con-
flict resolution services to industry, 
government 
agencies, 
and 
commu-
nities. The FMCS has 10 regional of-
fices, more than 60 field offices. Its 
headquarters are here in Washington, 
DC. 
It does the basic blocking and tack-
ling of keeping our economy running. 
It is charged with trying to avoid con-
flict between labor and management so 
that we don’t have strikes, so that we 
don’t have work stoppages, so that our 
economy runs as smoothly as possible. 
It is a pretty noncontroversial Agency, 
and the individual who has been se-
lected 
to run it is equally non-
controversial. He is a career public 
servant. 
Javier Ramirez began at the FMCS in 
2005. He is currently the director of 
Agency initiatives there. To me, this 
would be a no-brainer, that we could 
come together and decide as a body 
that we are going to make sure that we 
have someone running an Agency that 
is pretty vital to the smooth flow of 
our economy and the mediation of dis-
putes between labor and management. 
And so I would ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to execu-
tive session to consider the following 
nomination: Calendar No. 665, Javier 
Ramirez, of Illinois, to be Federal Me-
diation and Conciliation Director; that 
the Senate vote on the nomination 
without intervening action or debate; 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table; 
that any statements related to the 
nomination be printed in the RECORD; 
and that the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
Mr. President, Senator MURPHY indi-
cates there should be no discussion, 
really, because this is such a slam 
dunk. I am coming up to talk about it. 
We do not do regular order. Our job is 
to be there for advice and consent on 
any nominee. We have tried to shortcut 
the process, not only on nominations, 
but even things as important as our 
budgets. We don’t do anything any-
more with discussion that gets out 
maybe the rest of the story. 
I believe that on any of these, rather 
than proceeding to the floor, you ought 
to at least have a discussion in com-
mittee. That didn’t happen. There was 
a vote, but not a discussion. 
And when you look at this non-
controversial nominee, I think there 
are at least some things to think 
about. Harry Katz, a professor at the 
Cornell University School of Industrial 
and Labor Relations, said Mr. Ramirez 
could be open to expanding the range of 
disputes that the Agency will consider. 
So kind of hinting at some political 
enterprise that you would be doing 
more than just interpreting. He is not 
alone. Wilma Liebman, a former NLRB 
chair under President Obama, has told 
media that Mr. Ramirez should be 
‘‘open to creative expansion of what 
the mediators do.’’ 
We need public servants who are 
going to strictly interpret the law, and 
this looks like if we don’t at least have 
a recorded vote, it could slip through 
when 
it 
is 
not 
maybe 
as 
uncontroversial as Senator MURPHY 
might indicate. 
I have reservations about the nomi-
nee, mostly about the process, very in-
dicative of the way that things work 
here in general, not only for nomina-
tions, but critical policy. I think that 
has got to change. 
Therefore, I do object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. MURPHY. I know colleagues are 
eager to get this vote going, but 20 sec-
onds in response. 
This place is grinding to a halt. And 
it is absolutely extraordinary the num-
ber of noncontroversial nominees who 
are now required to move through full 
votes, cloture motions on the floor. 
U.S. Attorneys who never, ever had to 
come before this floor for votes and de-
bate now do. 
This is an exercise in fundamentally 
breaking the Senate. This place only 
works with UC. We cannot run every 
single nominee through regular order 
or we would be here 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week. 
I am grateful for my colleague’s com-
ments. I hope that we will be able to 
confirm Mr. Ramirez. But this is the 
kind of work that the Senate used to 
be able to do through UC, and it is un-
fortunate that we continue to have this 
breakdown in process.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

The majority leader. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 
an update on today’s floor schedule. At 
1:45, the Senate was scheduled to hold 
a procedural vote related to a shell leg-
islative vehicle we could use to pass 
COVID response funding. Our Repub-
lican colleagues have requested that we 
do not hold a cloture vote on the mo-
tion to proceed at the present as we are 
getting close to a final agreement that 
would garner bipartisan support. 
We are working diligently to finalize 
language, scoring, and a final agree-
ment on what should be funded in the 
final COVID package, both domestic 
and international. As a sign of good 
faith and to encourage us to come to a 
final agreement, I will reschedule to-
day’s procedural vote to a later time. 
H.R. 4373 
Mr. President, now, when it comes to 
replenishing COVID response funding, 
we simply cannot afford to kick the 
can down the road. We need more 
money right away so we have enough 
vaccines and testing and lifesaving 
therapeutics. 
We want our communities to go back 
to normal and stay normal. 
If a new virus comes—if a new vari-
ant comes, and we are not prepared, we 
could lose that ability to go back to 
normality, for our schools to stay 
open, for events to occur, for people to 
gather. We don’t want to do that. 
Well, the best way to avoid that from 
happening if, God forbid, a new variant 
comes—and it is likely that it will—is 
to have us prepared, and this COVID 
legislation has us prepared by having 
an adequate supply of these new, al-
most miraculous therapeutics that can 
greatly reduce the severity of any ill-
ness and that can be given right after 
testing. 
We need tests, and we need to make 
sure that the vaccines we have are 
ready and updated. We can’t wait. We 
can’t wait until COVID is upon us to do 
this. 
The prospect of not being prepared is 
scary, and Americans should all— 
Democrats, Republicans—be able to 
unite in making sure we are prepared. 
We need to get COVID funding done for 
the country before the end of the work 
period. It is very much needed, and so 
we are going to keep talking with the 
Republicans so we can hopefully agree 
to a robust package that keeps our 
country prepared. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—H.R. 4373 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the cloture motion with re-
spect to the motion to proceed to Cal-
endar No. 310, H.R. 4373, ripen at a time 
to be determined by the majority lead-
er in consultation with the Republican 
leader. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

fiscal year 2024, and $49,200,000 for fiscal year 
2025’’. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I fur-
ther ask that the committee-reported 
amendment be withdrawn; that the 
amendment, which is at the desk, be 
considered and agreed to; and that the 
bill, as amended, be considered read a 
third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment, 
in the nature of a substitute, was with-
drawn. 
The amendment (No. 5017), in the na-
ture of a substitute, was agreed to. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
know of no further debate on the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the bill having 
been read the third time, the question 
is, Shall the bill pass? 
The bill (S. 3580), as amended, was 
passed. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Senate has just passed very significant 
and much needed legislation that will 
reduce costs for the American people 
by passing a bipartisan bill to reform 
unfair shipping practices hurting ex-
ports and consumers alike. 
We have all seen pictures of scores of 
ships lining up in ports from Los Ange-
les to Seattle, to New York, to Savan-
nah. Supply chain backlogs have made 
it harder for goods to leave these ports 
and get to their international destina-
tions. 
Every single day that goods lie idle 
in our ports, it costs producers more 
and more money. It is a serious prob-
lem, rippling from one coast to the 
other. 
These backlogs have created serious 
price hikes. Today, according to one 
study, the price to transport a con-
tainer from China to the west coast of 
the United States costs 12 times as 
much as it did 2 years ago—12 times. 
Talk about supply chain backlogs. This 
is it—a glaring, glaring example. 
And, of course, it hurts both ways 
when shipping costs go up. It affects 
exports that we send overseas. It af-
fects many of our farmers, who need to 
export their goods. It also affects the 
imports that come back. It affects all 
the goods that Americans buy from 
overseas—appliances and food and so 
many other things. 
When the cost of shipping is higher, 
the cost of the goods are higher, and 
people have to pay too much—a whole 
lot more. 
At the end of the day, it is the Amer-
ican consumer that pays the higher 
price. Thankfully, this bill will make it 
harder for ocean carriers to unreason-
ably refuse American goods at our 
ports while strengthening the Federal 
Maritime Commission’s ability to step 
in and prevent harmful practices by 
carriers. 
This bipartisan shipping bill is ex-
actly the sort of thing that the Senate 
should focus on. It is cost cutting; it is 
bipartisan; and it will directly give re-
lief to small businesses and consumers 
alike. 
And I would like to thank a good 
number of my colleagues who helped 
with this legislation. It was put to-
gether and sponsored in a bipartisan 
way 
by 
Senators 
KLOBUCHAR
and 
THUNE. And Senator CANTWELL, who 
understands the maritime industry 
probably better than any other Mem-
ber in this Chamber, was relentless in 
pushing 
this 
legislation. 
It 
went 
through her committee, and now it has 
passed the Senate and, hopefully, will 
become law soon, and she deserves our 
kudos and accolades for the good job 
she has done for American consumers, 
farmers, manufacturers, and everybody 
else. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of Mr. Alex Wagner, 
the President’s nominee to be Assist-
ant Secretary of the Department of Air 
Force for Manpower and Reserve Af-
fairs; and Mr. Ashish Vazirani, nomi-
nee to be Deputy Under Secretary for 
Personnel and Readiness. 
As a Member of the Defense Appro-
priations Subcommittee, I know that 
the most important investment for our 
national security is in our servicemem-
bers—our real competitive advantage 
with Russia and China. 
Mr. Wagner brings a combination of 
public and private sector experience to 
the table. He will be key in recruiting, 
training, and retaining the talent need-
ed to compete in the 21st century. 
Absent his leadership, we may miss 
important opportunities to invest in 
our servicemembers at a time when we 
are still standing up a new military 
branch, the Space Force. 
Mr. Vazirani will be responsible for 
ensuring that we take care of our peo-
ple, a priority for the Secretary and ev-
eryone in this body. 
Mr. Vazirani has significant private 
sector experience as a consultant and 
manager. Further, he served in the 
Navy and is the father of a marine. He 
has 
the 
firsthand 
experience 
and 
knowledge that we need to help im-
prove the opportunities available to 
military families and spouses. 
Both of these nominees are needed to 
help implement important priorities, 
like the Independent Review Commis-
sion’s sexual assault recommendations, 
improving diversity in the force, and 
addressing mental health and suicide. 
Both of these nominees are focused 
on taking care of our people and ensur-
ing the Department has in place the 
workforce with the skill sets that we 
need to be successful in strategic com-
petition with Russia and China. 
Put simply, if you are serious about 
countering Russia and China, you 
should allow these nominees to be con-
firmed. And if you are serious about 
taking care of those who serve, you 
should allow these nominees to be con-
firmed. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to executive 
session to consider the following nomi-
nations, en bloc: Calendar Nos. 477 and 
599; that the Senate vote on the nomi-
nations, en bloc, without intervening 
action or debate; that the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table; that any statements re-
lated to the nominations be printed in 
the RECORD; that the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion; and that the Senate then resume 
legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Missouri is recog-
nized. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, it is 
now March. It has been 7 months since 
the disastrous withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan. 
Thirteen servicemembers lost their 
lives in the attack on Abbey Gate 
along with hundreds of civilians. As a 
result of the botched evacuation oper-
ation, hundreds, if not thousands, of 
American civilians were left behind to 
the enemy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1892 
March 31, 2022 
We hear from our friends on the 
other side of the aisle that my insist-
ence that we actually vote on nominees 
is unprecedented. I would humbly sug-
gest that the Afghanistan crisis into 
which this President led our country 
was unprecedented. 
And who has been held accountable 
for that disaster? No one. Who has the 
President fired? Who has offered their 
resignation? Which of the planners at 
the Department of State or the Depart-
ment of Defense or the National Secu-
rity Council have been relieved of 
duty? No one. 
Until there is accountability, I am 
going to ask that the Senate do the 
simple task of its job, which is to actu-
ally vote on these nominees. The least 
we could do is observe regular order 
and vote on these leadership positions 
at the Department of Defense. 
My colleagues say that we have got 
to put national security first. I agree 
with them about that. But I believe 
that begins at the top, with the Presi-
dent of the United States and the lead-
ership of the Department of Defense 
and the Department of State. I, for 
one, am not going to stand by and look 
the other way while this administra-
tion systematically endangers our na-
tional security, imperils the American 
people, and watches the sacrifice of our 
soldiers go by without any account-
ability, without any change in direc-
tion. 
Accountability for the Afghanistan 
disaster is all the more urgent given 
revelations last month from the U.S. 
Central Command investigation of the 
Abbey Gate bombing. The investigative 
report makes clear that the Adminis-
tration had ample warning prior to 
mid-August that Kabul could collapse 
rapidly in the face of the Taliban’s of-
fensive. It shows further how the Ad-
ministration refused to acknowledge 
those warnings and act in a timely 
manner to prepare for Kabul’s fall. And 
it shows in astounding detail just how 
chaotic the final evacuation effort was, 
with U.S. servicemembers often left 
without clear guidance, the State De-
partment constantly missing in action, 
and the Administration itself intent 
only on evacuating as many people as 
possible, regardless of whether those 
individuals were eligible for evacuation 
or might pose a threat to America’s 
own security. 
I am not willing to look the other 
way and just pretend that Afghanistan 
didn’t happen, which seems to be the 
posture that many in this body have 
adopted. I am not willing to do that. I 
can’t do that because I promised the 
parents of the fallen that I wouldn’t do 
that. 
I am going to discharge my responsi-
bility. And as long as it takes, I will 
continue to draw attention to what 
happened at Abbey Gate and to demand 
accountability for the disaster that 
this administration has pushed upon 
this country and upon the people of my 
State. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin is recognized. 
Ms. BALDWIN. I am disappointed 
that my Republican colleague blocked 
confirmation of these nominations. 
These nominees have been held up 
since last year. They were approved by 
the Armed Services Committee with a 
bipartisan vote and only one Member 
recorded as a no. It is time to end these 
delays and confirm these nominees. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. The clerk will 
call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNIZING THE COMMISSIONING OF THE USS 
‘‘DELAWARE’’ 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to mark a moment in history for 
the 
First 
State, 
your 
neighboring 
State, to celebrate the first U.S. Navy 
vessel to be named after Delaware in 
more than 100 years. 
In 2 days, I will be joined by the Sec-
retary of the Navy, the First Lady of 
the United States, and what will feel 
like half of Delaware at the Port of 
Wilmington to commemorate the com-
missioning of the Virginia Class of nu-
clear submarine, the USS Delaware. 
And while the vessel was first offi-
cially commissioned underwater and 
underway on a mission at sea due to 
the COVID restrictions on April 4, 
2020—a first in Navy history—a first in 
Navy history—this weekend, we will 
get to give the USS Delaware, its crew, 
and the people of Delaware a fitting 
celebration above the surface of the 
water. 
It has been a long time coming for 
the USS Delaware. So many people 
across Delaware and in the Navy have 
worked hard not just for weeks, not 
just for months, but for years to make 
this weekend a reality for our State 
and the crew. 
I would be remiss not to mention my 
wingman in the U.S. Senate, Senator 
CHRIS COONS, and our wing-woman in 
the U.S. House of Representatives, 
LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER, as well as our 
Governor John Carney for their long- 
standing support for the USS Delaware. 
They will be joining us on Saturday to 
celebrate. 
You probably wouldn’t be surprised 
to learn that SSN 791—that is the num-
ber assigned to the USS Delaware, is 
not the first Navy vessel to bear the 
name ‘‘Delaware.’’ 
The first USS Delaware was launched 
in 1776. Its role? Delaying the British 
Fleet’s approach to Philadelphia and 
thus impeding the ability of the British 
to resupply their army in our War of 
Independence. That was the first USS 
Delaware. 
The sixth USS Delaware was com-
pleted in April of 1910. Armed with ten 
12-inch guns, it was the most powerful 
battleship in the world at the time. 
Over 100 years would pass before an-
other US Naval vessel would bear the 
name ‘‘Delaware.’’ 
Then, one day in 2012, I came across 
a letter to the editor from a con-
stituent in Delaware whose name is 
Steven Llanso. He wrote to the editor. 
He said: You know, it has been a long 
time since a ship was built and named 
after the State of Delaware. Maybe 
somebody should do something about 
it. 
I thought about it for a while. I 
thought about it for a couple of weeks, 
actually. I pulled my staff together and 
said, ‘‘Why don’t we do something 
about this?’’ And they said ‘‘Let’s do,’’ 
and we did. 
The next week, I was on the phone 
with then-Secretary of the Navy Ray 
Mabus, 
former 
Governor 
of 
Mis-
sissippi—us both being former Gov-
ernors—and a long-time friend, and he 
would go on to become the longest 
serving Secretary of the Navy in the 
history of our country. 
I explained the situation to Sec-
retary Mabus. He graciously heard me 
out and agreed 100 years was a long 
time. Before we hung up, he said to me, 
‘‘Let me think about it, Tom. I will get 
back to you in a couple of months.’’ 
And true to his word, 3 months later, 
he gave me a call and said that over 
the next several years, the Navy would 
begin construction on not one, not two, 
but three, maybe four Virginia Class 
nuclear submarines, and the first one 
off the line would be named the USS 
Delaware. 
Now, I was talking on a mobile 
phone, but if I had a landline—if I was 
talking with him through a landline, I 
could 
have 
reached 
through 
the 
landline and kissed him. I was so 
happy. And I didn’t do that. But it was 
a wonderful moment, one that I rel-
ished in, and I certainly do today. He is 
a great friend, a great leader of the 
Navy then and a patriot, and he has 
done so many things for our country. 
So thank you, Ray. 
So this weekend, almost a decade 
since I first spoke with then-Secretary 
Mabus, I will have the honor of finally 
introducing the newest USS Delaware 
to the people of Delaware. And there is 
a whole lot of it to take in. 
The USS Delaware is a Virginia Class 
U.S. nuclear submarine. The Delaware 
will carry 26 MK–48 torpedoes, which 
enable it to conduct the sub’s more tra-
ditional role of tracking and, if nec-
essary, sinking enemy submarines, as 
well as a wide range of surface vessels. 
The Delaware is also designed for 
versatile operations in shallow water, 
closer to land, performing reconnais-
sance 
activities, 
delivering 
Special 
Forces. It is also configured to launch 
Tomahawk cruise missiles which can 
be launched while the Delaware is on 
patrol. The Tomahawk can strike tar-
gets nearly 1,000 miles away with pin-
point—pinpoint—accuracy. 
This is one hell of a fighting ma-
chine. You know, they have a saying 
down in Texas you have probably 
heard. 
It 
says 
‘‘Don’t

Texas,’’ and I would just add to that, to 
our adversaries, ‘‘Don’t mess with the 
USS Delaware because, if you do, we 
will eat your lunch. I promise.’’ 
And, oh, yes. There are 136 crew-
members aboard the USS Delaware. 
They hail from 20 States across our 
country. Almost half of the States are 
represented in the crew of our sub. The 
crew also includes 15 officers and 121 
enlisted men, a dozen or so who are 
chief petty officers. My dad was a chief 
petty officer for nearly 30 years, World 
War II and beyond. And he always told 
me when I was a midshipman, he used 
to say, ‘‘Tom, the chiefs run the 
Navy.’’ And you know, they did, and 
my guess is they still do. 
But in addition to having an oppor-
tunity to introduce the crew of the 
USS Delaware to the people of Dela-
ware this weekend, we will also have 
an opportunity to introduce Delaware 
to the crew of the State that they are 
representing. 
With tongue in cheek, I like to de-
scribe Delaware as the 49th largest 
State in the Union, and it is comprised 
of three counties and 1 million people. 
We are about 100 miles from north to 
south and about 50 miles from east to 
west along our southern border with 
Maryland, 
the 
Presiding 
Officer’s 
State. 
Native 
Americans, 
including 
the 
Lenape Indians, lived in Delaware for 
hundreds of years before the Dutch ar-
rived some 400 years ago and estab-
lished Lewes, DE, the first town in the 
first State, located where the Atlantic 
Ocean meets the Delaware Bay. 
A quick story: The Dutch were not 
all that kind to these Native Ameri-
cans who lived in that greater area 
which is now Lewes. And the Native 
Americans literally wiped out the 
Dutch colony. Later on, the Dutch 
would come back in greater numbers, 
be more kind to the Native Americans, 
and the colony of Lewes grew and pros-
pered. 
The British looked askance at this 
and worried about the growth of this 
Dutch colony surrounded by British 
settlements and forces. One night, the 
Dutch went to bed to sleep in Lewes, 
DE, and the Brits burned the town to 
the ground. The next morning, when 
the Dutch surveyed what happened, 
there was one house still standing, the 
Ryves Holt House, believed to be 
maybe the oldest permanently stand-
ing house in North America. The Ryves 
Holt House is now a part of a national 
park. 
Later on, in 1631, the first Swedes and 
Finns sailed by what would become the 
Port of Wilmington. Their sailing 
ships—the Kalmar Nyckel and the 
Fogel Grip—took a turn to the west for 
a couple miles on a smaller river that 
they named the Christina after Swe-
den’s 12-year-old child queen. Along its 
banks, they established the colony of 
New Sweden, where Wilmington stands 
today. The church they built there is 
believed to be perhaps the longest con-
tinuously serving church in North 
America—Old Swedes church—and be-
lieve it or not, there are now more 
Swedish-Americans 
than 
there 
are 
Swedes in Sweden. 
Fifty-one years later, William Penn 
would sail up the Delaware, past Wil-
mington, past the Port of Wilmington 
now, to what is called Penn’s Landing, 
about 25 miles north of Wilmington, 
and carried with him the deeds from 
the King of England to what would 
later become the Colony of Pennsyl-
vania and something called ‘‘the Lower 
Three Counties.’’ That would be us, 
Delaware. But the real Penn’s Landing, 
ironically, was in what is now New Cas-
tle, DE—not Pennsylvania, but New 
Castle, DE. 
And there is a legend. Legend has it 
that not only did he stop there, but he 
spent the night in Delaware. And later 
on, he was asked why did he stop in 
Delaware, and he said, ‘‘Tax-free shop-
ping.’’ ‘‘Tax-free shopping.’’ 
A few hundred years later, up the 
Christina River, 10,000 shipbuilders, 
mostly women, would build many of 
the ships, including destroyer escorts 
and troop landing ships that enabled us 
to emerge victorious in World War II. 
And that is only part of the storied his-
tory that the USS Delaware joins 
today. 
Throughout Delaware history, the 
letter ‘‘C’’ has figured prominently. 
Our first settlers planted corn—a lot of 
it. They raised chickens, a lot of them, 
and fed them corn. Our State bird is, 
believe it or not, the ‘‘fightin’’’ blue 
hen. Today, there are nearly 300 chick-
ens for every person who lives in the 
First State of Delaware. Later, we be-
come known as the ‘‘Chemical Capital 
of the World.’’ Thank you, DuPont, for 
hundreds of amazing, amazing inven-
tions. Delaware’s coastline is not large, 
but the last I checked, it was home to 
the most five-star beaches than any 
other State coastline in America—and 
one of them is Rehoboth. And Reho-
both is a name that is translated to 
mean ‘‘room for all.’’ 
Not long ago, we built more cars in 
Delaware per capita than any other 
State. Not surprising is that they were 
Chryslers and Chevrolets. 
And while we have no sales tax, Dela-
ware is the home of incorporation of 
half the Fortune 500 and half the New 
York Stock Exchange. So corporations 
are important to us. While I don’t 
know what credit card is in the wallet 
of most of the people on the floor 
today, there is a good chance it is 
issued by a bank with operations in 
Delaware. 
Now, that is a lot of C’s, but even our 
political leaders have gotten into the 
act with names like Carvel, former 
Governor; Castle, former Governor; 
Carney, current Governor; COONS, our 
senior 
Senator; 
and 
CARPER, 
his 
wingman. And even though Joe Biden 
didn’t start out as one of the C-boys, he 
was close, just off by one letter. Joe 
Biden has ended up, as you know, as 
our 
Nation’s 
Commander-in-Chief. 
That is a lot of C’s put together in a 
very nice way. Not bad for a scrappy 
kid from Scranton, PA. 
By far, the greatest contribution 
that Delaware has made since the 
founding of our country occurred on 
December 7, 1787, when Delaware be-
came the first State to ratify our Con-
stitution. I like to say we are the first 
to ratify, followed shortly thereafter 
by Maryland, Pennsylvania, and oth-
ers; but for 1 whole week, Delaware was 
the entire United States of America. 
We opened it up and let others in. And 
I think for the most part, it turned out 
pretty well, at least until now. But the 
Constitution that we ratified on De-
cember 7, 1787, would become the most 
enduring Constitution in the history of 
the world and by far the most rep-
licated. 
You know, none of us are perfect— 
certainly not me—and our Constitution 
was not perfect either; but over time, 
we have made it better, a lot better. 
Along with the Bill of Rights, it pro-
vides a framework, if you will, and a 
path that has made our country the 
envy of much of the rest of the world. 
But at the end of the day, our Con-
stitution and our Declaration of Inde-
pendence are words on a piece of paper 
without the resolve made real by the 
commitment and sacrifice of men and 
women who wear and have worn the 
uniform of our country. 
Let me end with this. I suspect that 
most 
of 
my 
colleagues 
remember 
studying the Constitution in school— 
maybe in grade school, maybe in mid-
dle school. I remember it. In fact, my 
sister and I had to learn and actually 
recite the Preamble in middle school. 
As you know, it begins with something 
like this: 
We the People of the United States, in 
Order to form a more perfect Union, estab-
lish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, 
provide for the common defense, promote the 
general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of 
Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do 
ordain and establish this Constitution of the 
United States of America. 
The Preamble of our Constitution 
doesn’t say ‘‘in order to form a perfect 
Union’’; 
it 
says 
‘‘a 
more 
perfect 
Union.’’ Why is that? Because as citi-
zens of our great country, it is up to 
each of us to do our part to ensure that 
the arc of American history bends to-
ward 
perfection 
and 
justice, 
even 
knowing that we will probably never 
fully achieve it. 
The men who serve and will serve 
aboard the USS Delaware will bear our 
State’s namesake literally for decades 
to come, maybe a half-century or more, 
in defense of our Nation. The crew-
members are answering the call of our 
Nation written over 230 years ago. 
Through their sacrifice, through their 
service, may we grow even closer to 
that more perfect Union. We are—I 
know I am—grateful for their service 
today. 
May God bless and protect the crew 
of the USS Delaware, both now and in 
the decades to come, and may each of 
us live our own lives in ways to ensure

that America remains a nation worthy 
of their sacrifice so that a government 
of the people, by the people, and for the 
people will not perish from this Earth. 
USS Delaware, long may she sail. 
And before I yield back my time, I 
guess we have been joined on the floor 
by our friend and colleague, JOHN COR-
NYN from Texas. And Senator CORNYN, 
I think maybe before he arrived, I used 
the phrase—I acknowledged the phrase, 
‘‘Don’t mess with Texas.’’ ‘‘Don’t mess 
with Texas.’’ And I went on to explain 
all the weapons systems that the USS 
Delaware has on board. It is a pretty 
amazing, incredible submarine. And I 
said: It is all right not to mess with 
Texas, but you better not mess—for our 
adversaries, you better not mess with 
Delaware, either. 
With that, I yield the floor to my 
friend from Texas, Senator CORNYN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, next 
week, the Senate will vote on the con-
firmation of Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson to serve as a member of the 
Supreme Court of the United States. 
Since Judge Jackson’s nomination 
was announced, I made it clear that I 
would go into this process with an open 
mind, just as I have tried to do with 
each Supreme Court nominee who has 
come before the Judiciary Committee 
during my time in the Senate. This is 
now my eighth Supreme Court Justice 
to participate in the confirmation of. 
Now, I have seen the good, the bad, 
and the ugly when it comes to judicial 
confirmation hearings, and I know that 
some people expressed concerns about 
the tough questions that Judge Jack-
son fielded. I thought she did a credible 
job answering those questions. She is 
obviously incredibly smart, but I found 
her personally very charming as well. 
Judge Jackson has received two de-
grees from Harvard, completed a Su-
preme Court clerkship, and served on 
the Federal bench for nearly a decade. 
I hear no one questioning Judge Jack-
son’s legal credentials, but a lifetime 
appointment to the Supreme Court re-
quires a lot more than just the right 
resume. Our constitutional Republic 
requires judges who rule based on the 
law, not based on their personal policy 
preferences or beliefs and certainly not 
based on a result and working your 
way back to a justification for that 
particular result. Judges are required 
to go wherever the law may lead them. 
Justice Scalia, during his lifetime, 
said: If you haven’t made a decision as 
a judge that you personally disagree 
with because the law compels it, you 
are really probably not doing your job 
as a judge. And I think there is a lot of 
truth to that. As I say, the job is not to 
start with the desired result and work 
backwards and cherry-pick the legal 
reasoning to justify the decision. 
The question we tried to answer— 
those of us who serve on the Judiciary 
Committee—last week is, Where would 
Judge Jackson fit in this mold if con-
firmed to the Supreme Court? Would 
she be an impartial umpire who follows 
the letter of the law or would she at-
tempt to legislate from the bench? The 
reason that is important is because, 
under our Constitution, Members of 
the Senate are supposed to legislate. 
But that is also the reason why we run 
for election, and we are held account-
able each election for the votes we take 
and the policy positions we embrace. 
That is how public policy in America is 
supposed to be made, not by judges who 
serve for a lifetime and whom the vot-
ers cannot unelect, like they can Mem-
bers of the Senate. That is why their 
job is very different. 
Before Judge Jackson was named as 
the nominee for this seat, President 
Biden outlined what he was looking for 
in a candidate. Among the many quali-
ties and beliefs that he specified, the 
President said, tellingly, he wanted 
someone with a judicial philosophy 
that 
‘‘suggests 
that 
there 
are 
unenumerated rights in the Constitu-
tion, and all the amendments mean 
something, 
including 
the 
Ninth 
Amendment.’’ Those are code words, 
and let me explain. 
This wasn’t a one-off comment by 
President Biden. He even said on the 
campaign trail that he would not nomi-
nate somebody for the Supreme Court 
who 
did 
not 
have 
a 
view 
that 
unenumerated rights exist in the Con-
stitution. 
Now, 
translated 
into 
English, that is tantamount to saying 
that judges shouldn’t be bound by a 
written Constitution. 
You might wonder, if they are not 
bound by the text and the words of the 
Constitution, where does their author-
ity come from? 
The President stated and restated a 
litmus test for his desired Supreme 
Court candidate, and he has clearly de-
termined that Judge Jackson fits the 
bill. So I spent my time during the Ju-
diciary Committee hearing asking her 
about 
unenumerated 
or 
what 
you 
might call invisible rights during her 
confirmation 
hearing—invisible 
be-
cause they are not in the text. 
I told Judge Jackson it is deeply con-
cerning to me and to the people I rep-
resent that five unelected and unac-
countable Justices could upend the will 
of the people by invalidating laws or 
inventing a new right out of whole 
cloth. We talked a lot about sub-
stantive due process. I suggested that 
she and I nerd out together, since that 
is not a topic that people typically talk 
about around the kitchen table, but 
maybe they do in a sense I will talk 
about in a moment. 
Substantive due process is this the-
ory that somehow, when you combine 
the 5th Amendment due process clause 
with the 14th Amendment due process 
clause, that out of that formula, un-
written and invisible rights can sud-
denly appear. This is really just judge- 
made law. 
We have seen many examples of this. 
For example, in Plessy v. Ferguson, the 
Supreme Court established the shame-
ful doctrine of separate but equal when 
it came to the treatment of African 
Americans in our country. Thankfully, 
that was later overruled by Brown v. 
Board of Education. But it is an exam-
ple of the sort of horrific outcomes 
that 
can 
occur 
when 
judges—five 
judges, unelected, lifetime tenured—de-
cide to become policymakers in their 
own right. 
Perhaps most famous in legal cir-
cles—certainly 
in 
law 
school—you 
learn about Lochner v. New York. That 
was another example of substantive 
due process where the Supreme Court 
invalidated 
some 
labor 
regulations 
with regard to how long bakers could 
work. In that, the Supreme Court dis-
covered a freedom to contract right— 
again, nowhere written in the Con-
stitution but another example of a re-
sult-oriented outcome based on unwrit-
ten constitutional rights. 
Now, one of the most famous exam-
ples is Roe v. Wade in which the Su-
preme Court found a constitutional 
right to an abortion. I asked Judge 
Jackson if the word ‘‘abortion’’ or the 
word ‘‘marriage’’ was found anywhere 
in the Constitution, and she agreed 
with me that, no, they are not men-
tioned in the Constitution. 
Now, here is my point. It is not the 
outcome 
necessarily, 
because 
sub-
stantive due process can be used for 
good or for ill. In other words, the good 
is when I agree with the outcome, and 
the ill is when I disagree. But the main 
problem is that unelected judges are 
making policy, binding the entire 
country under the guise of substantive 
due process, which is nothing but judi-
cial lawmaking. So this doctrine of 
substantive due process can be used for 
things you agree with and things you 
disagree with. 
The point is that this has, I think, 
helped us hone in on the limitless abili-
ties of five Justices to discover new 
rights that aren’t even mentioned in 
the Constitution and then to eliminate 
any sort of debate or democratic proc-
ess where people actually get to vote 
on public policies because essentially 
the Supreme Court has taken the issue 
out of the public square. They said: We 
have already decided it, and we don’t 
really care what you think. 
Even Justice Hugo Black, a noted lib-
eral in the classical sense, said the due 
process clause itself in the 5th and 14th 
Amendments was designed to make 
certain that men would be governed by 
law, not the arbitrary fiat of the man 
or men in power. And you would have 
to update to say ‘‘man or woman,’’ ob-
viously. 
We all know judges on the Supreme 
Court and on the Federal bench are 
unelected and therefore unaccountable 
to the people. Federal judges discov-
ering rights that do not exist in the 
written Constitution essentially pro-
vides a rudderless and, I would argue, 
eventually lawless authority to the Su-
preme Court. 
The 
very 
nature 
of 
our 
three 
branches of government is to divide re-
sponsibilities among those branches.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1895 
March 31, 2022 
As I mentioned, the political branches 
are the executive branch, the Presi-
dent; legislative branch, obviously that 
is Congress, the House and the Senate. 
Our job is far different, and it is impor-
tant to have judges understand their 
limited but vital role under the Con-
stitution. Their job is to interpret the 
laws as written, not to make them up 
as you go along or to use a smoke-
screen, like substantive due process, to 
identify new rights that do not appear 
anywhere in the Constitution. 
If the American people want to 
amend the Constitution, which they 
have done 27 times during our Nation’s 
history, there is a way to do that. Sure, 
it is a tough battle. You have to win a 
supermajority of both Houses, and you 
have to get it ratified by the States. 
But you can do it, and it has been done 
27 times. 
But there are people who want to 
take a shortcut, and they want judges 
to abuse their authority by identifying 
these unwritten rights. 
Well, what is at stake when that hap-
pens? When judges invent new rights, 
decide issues that are not in their lane, 
as Judge Jackson liked to say—she 
would say ‘‘making policy is not in my 
lane’’—or when a judge acts as a pol-
icymaker, like Congress is supposed to 
do, like the executive branch is sup-
posed to do, when judges act that way, 
they necessarily undermine the Amer-
ican people’s right to choose. 
The 
Declaration 
of 
Independence 
notes that the authority of government 
is derived from the consent of the gov-
erned. But how do judges, when they 
identify unmentioned rights out of 
whole cloth, how do we, as the Amer-
ican people, get to consent or withhold 
that consent? Thus, it is easy to see 
how judge-made law and these smoke-
screens, like substantive due process, 
are really methods by which some 
members of the judiciary undermine 
the basic and fundamental premise and 
legitimacy of our laws because the con-
sent of the governed to those judges is 
irrelevant. 
Now, one unfortunate consequence of 
judge-made law that is not in the Con-
stitution as written, is that anybody 
who disagrees with you—and this act of 
judicial activism—can easily be ac-
cused of discrimination or even labeled 
a bigot, even if their belief is derived 
from religious conviction, which is ex-
pressly protected by the Constitution. 
This is what happens when invisible 
rights conflict with rights that are ac-
tually written into the Constitution, 
like the First Amendment, like the 
right to religious liberty. 
President Biden assured the Amer-
ican people that he would nominate 
somebody 
who 
believed 
in 
unenumerated rights, so I asked Judge 
Jackson 
a 
logical 
question: 
What 
unenumerated rights are there? 
The American people deserve to 
know. Certainly, in casting our vote 
for or against a nomination, the Senate 
deserves to know. But she refused to 
provide an answer. 
This isn’t the only place where Judge 
Jackson was less than candid. My col-
leagues and I repeatedly asked Judge 
Jackson about her judicial philosophy, 
a standard question during these con-
firmation hearings. Now, Judge Jack-
son has a marvelous legal education. 
She has vast practical experience be-
cause she was a public defender, a Fed-
eral district judge, a circuit court 
judge, and now will serve on the Su-
preme Court. 
So when you ask a judge with that 
sort of pedigree, ‘‘Tell us about the 
way you decide cases: What is your ju-
dicial philosophy?’’ Well, it is not a 
trap or a trick question. It is some-
thing that every Supreme Court nomi-
nee has been asked to describe. 
Most recently, Judge Barrett identi-
fied her judicial philosophy, describing 
herself 
as 
a 
‘‘textualist’’ 
and 
an 
‘‘originalist.’’ Now, those are awkward 
terms, but I think what that means is 
she believes in interpreting the law as 
written and as understood at the time 
it was written. That is what she refers 
to as a ‘‘written Constitution.’’ 
Judge Jackson previously suggested 
she didn’t have a judicial philosophy at 
all—something I find impossible to be-
lieve with somebody with this sort of 
experience and background and incred-
ibly impressive education. 
During her confirmation hearing, she 
failed to provide much clarity beyond 
offering vague statements about her 
methodology. But her methodology is 
not a philosophy. We need a clear un-
derstanding of how Judge Jackson 
views judge-made law and the invis-
ible—you might say ‘‘unenumerated,’’ 
in the words of President Biden—rights 
that she finds in the Constitution. 
In order for me to fulfill my responsi-
bility as a Member of the Senate to 
provide advice and consent, I need to 
know and understand how Judge Jack-
son interprets the law and the Con-
stitution, not asking her to make spe-
cific commitments on results or out-
comes. I would never do that because 
judges are supposed to interpret, apply 
the law to a case-by-case method. But 
after repeated questioning, the judge 
refused to answer that question. 
The prism or philosophy through 
which a Supreme Court nominee views 
the law and interprets the Constitution 
is a critical indicator for determining 
if the judge will ‘‘stay in her lane’’— 
again, those were the terms that Judge 
Jackson used—or whether she will be-
come a policymaker that President 
Biden and outside groups like Demand 
Justice want her to be. 
Demand Justice is an advocacy group 
that advocates defunding the police 
and progressive solutions to society’s 
problems. They don’t want her calling 
balls and strikes; they want her put-
ting her thumb on their side of the 
scale and judging in a results-oriented 
fashion. 
As 
I 
reviewed 
Judge 
Jackson’s 
record, I saw some examples of activ-
ism bleeding through her decisions. 
One of Judge Jackson’s opinions from 
her time on the DC district court dem-
onstrates the serious concerns that I 
have about her ability to follow the 
letter of the law as expressed by Con-
gress as opposed to her personal pref-
erences. 
In the case Make the Road New York 
v. McAleenan, a progressive organiza-
tion challenged the Trump administra-
tion’s regulation of expedited removal 
proceedings for people who illegally 
enter our country without the appro-
priate paperwork. The Immigration 
and Nationality Act gives the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security ‘‘sole and 
unreviewable discretion’’ to apply ex-
pedited removal proceedings. Expedited 
removal is actually a deterrent for ille-
gal immigration because if migrants 
realize that without authorization they 
enter the country and they are going to 
be removed on an expedited basis, a 
whole lot of them won’t spend the 
money and take the time on that dan-
gerous journey from their home to our 
shores or to our border if they know 
they are not going to be successful. So 
this was not a minor matter. But the 
Immigration 
and 
Nationality 
Act 
doesn’t leave any gray area for inter-
pretation. Sole and unreviewable dis-
cretion is as clear as it comes. 
Judge Jackson, who presided over 
this case, decidedly did not stay in her 
lane. She went beyond the unambig-
uous text to deliver a political win to a 
progressive group and, in the process, 
entered an injunction barring the use 
of this tool that is needed by our Bor-
der Patrol and immigration authorities 
in order to deter people from violating 
our immigration laws. 
Unsurprisingly, her decision was ap-
pealed and ultimately overturned by 
the DC circuit court. I think this is a 
clear-cut example of Judge Jackson ig-
noring the law as written in order to 
achieve a result that she preferred. 
The critical point to underscore is 
that as Members of Congress, we are 
elected and accountable. We can get 
elected, and we can get unelected when 
our constituents don’t like what we are 
doing. But our authority comes from 
the electoral process, which is another 
way of saying the consent of the gov-
erned, as I mentioned, in the Declara-
tion of Independence. 
With each bill that is signed into law, 
we are interacting with the will of our 
constituents. And if they don’t like 
what we are doing, you can bet we hear 
from them and certainly will in the 
next election, if not before. 
But by ignoring these laws passed by 
Congress and signed by the President, 
Judge Jackson is doing more than just 
disregarding Congress; she is rejecting 
the right of the American people to 
govern themselves, to consent to the 
laws or withhold their consent. 
If given a lifetime appointment to 
the Supreme Court, I have to wonder: 
How many other laws would Judge 
Jackson 
ignore? 
How 
many 
other 
precedents would she seek to overturn 
simply because she doesn’t agree with 
them? How far would she go to achieve

a 
specific 
result 
by 
discovering 
unenumerated and, hence, invisible 
rights, whether it relates to immigra-
tion, abortion, religion, the Second 
Amendment, or anything else you 
might imagine that the Supreme Court 
might consider? 
The separation of powers between the 
three coequal branches of government 
is a central feature of our constitu-
tional democracy. Not only do we have 
three branches, we also have multiple 
levels of Federal, State, and local gov-
ernments—a Federal system. That is 
because the Founders of this great 
country and the people who ratified the 
Constitution believed that the best 
way to protect their liberty was by en-
acting checks and balances on the au-
thority of government because they 
didn’t trust any person to stay in their 
lane. They wanted checks and balances 
to make sure there was a method of en-
forcing 
elected 
officials, 
including 
judges, to stay in their lane. 
Sixth Circuit Chief Judge Jeffrey 
Sutton recently wrote a book whose 
title sums up the overarching debate 
with a single, succinct question. Ulti-
mately, this is a question of who de-
cides. Do we the people decide? Do our 
elected representatives whom we dele-
gate the authority to make decisions 
on our behalf, do they decide or do 
unelected, 
lifetime-tenured, 
unac-
countable Federal judges—are they free 
to be roaming policymakers, enacting 
judge-made law, which actually con-
tradicts or conflicts with the will of 
the American people, as evidenced by 
the laws passed by their elected rep-
resentatives? When there is a conflict 
between 
the 
different 
levels 
or 
branches of government, who decides is 
how we determine who holds the power 
to make decisions that impact every 
citizen in this country. And as I said, 
all power, political and government au-
thority, is derived from the people. 
Voters select Senators, Congressmen, 
even the President of the United 
States, but they have no direct say in 
the process of selecting Supreme Court 
Justices. That is why our responsi-
bility, part of the Constitution known 
as advice and consent—that is why our 
constitutional obligation is so impor-
tant. 
We have the responsibility to deter-
mine whether a nominee understands 
the important but limited role of Fed-
eral judges and can be expected to act 
with restraint, fairness, impartiality, 
and ultimately in the best interest of 
the American people. 
Ultimately, I fear Judge Jackson has 
a blind spot when it comes to judge- 
made law, and she would use her seat 
on the Supreme Court to create new 
rights out of whole cloth and engage in 
result-oriented decision making. 
For that reason, I will oppose Judge 
Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme 
Court of the United States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
am here on a very important bipartisan 
bill, but I first wanted to address the 
fact that I am proud to be supporting 
Judge Jackson. 
I think she has incredible legal expe-
rience—more experience as a judge 
going into the job than four of the peo-
ple had when they went on to the Su-
preme Court. 
She is in the top two for trial experi-
ence. She showed incredible grace 
under pressure when one over-the-top, 
inappropriate question was asked of 
her after another. 
She will be walking into that Su-
preme Court with her head held high, 
and she is going to be confirmed next 
week. 
As I said, I will speak more to this 
later. I spoke a lot about it in the Judi-
ciary Committee, but she is going to be 
a great Supreme Court Justice. 
OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT 
Mr. President, I rise today to high-
light my bill with Senator THUNE, 
which just passed the Senate, the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act. 
We worked for months together on 
this bill to come to an agreement. We 
did everything right and got cospon-
sors on both sides of the aisle. I par-
ticularly want to thank Baz, my staff 
member on the Commerce Committee, 
who did such a great job in working on 
this. And I also want to thank Senators 
CANTWELL and WICKER for their support 
of the bill as the chair and ranking 
member on the Commerce Committee. 
We worked together on some changes 
to the bill, and I appreciated their 
input. 
As U.S. Senators representing Min-
nesota and South Dakota, Senator 
THUNE and I know how crucial it is for 
American businesses to be able to ex-
port throughout the country and across 
the globe. American farmers feed the 
world, and consumers and businesses 
look to them for in-demand agricul-
tural goods like soybeans, corn, dairy, 
poultry, pork, and beef, just to name a 
few. And American manufacturers sup-
port so many of the essential parts and 
products that fill our jobs, businesses, 
and store shelves. 
As I look at our economy as we come 
out of this economic downturn, we 
must be an economy and a country 
that makes stuff, that invents things, 
that exports to the world. No matter 
how much American ingenuity we 
have—and there is a lot of it—if ships 
owned by foreign interests are going to 
other countries with empty containers 
and exporting nothing but air and then 
come to our country filled with foreign 
goods, that is not exactly an even play-
ing field. 
As the past 2 years have highlighted, 
significant supply chain disruptions 
and 
vulnerabilities 
have 
occurred. 
There are many answers here, one of 
them being workforce, one of them 
being port infrastructure and rail in-
frastructure and the like, but what we 
have seen when it comes to shipping— 
and I am so glad my colleague from 
South Dakota has joined me here on 
the floor—what we have seen in the 
middle of the country, where people are 
pretty sensible, all of a sudden they are 
looking at this, and they see the price 
of shipping containers increase by four 
times in just 2 years. Four times—that 
is not normal. 
We have also heard from U.S. compa-
nies that they have only been able to 
ship 60 percent of their orders because 
they can’t access the shipping con-
tainers. At the same time, these ocean 
carriers—almost 
all 
foreign-owned— 
have reported record profits. It is esti-
mated that the container shipping in-
dustry made a record $190 billion in 
profits in 2021, a sevenfold increase 
from the previous year. 
Their financial performance isn’t a 
result of improved performance when 
our manufacturers and farmers can’t 
ship out their goods, no. They are 
fleecing consumers and exporters be-
cause they know they can get away 
with it, and this is all while exporters 
and consumers are literally paying the 
price for the supply chain disruptions 
caused by unreliable service. 
(Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the 
Chair.) 
We need to get exports to those who 
need them, but it is plainly obvious 
that the ocean carriers are prioritizing 
non-American shipments at the ex-
pense of both American exporters—as 
in manufacturers, so many of them in 
Minnesota and South Dakota, as Sen-
ator THUNE knows, being small busi-
nesses—as well as farmers and Amer-
ican consumers. It isn’t sustainable, 
and it isn’t acceptable. We can’t let 
ocean carriers slow down our supply 
chain while shaking down our Amer-
ican businesses and farmers for their 
own profit. 
That is why we introduced the Ocean 
Shipping Reform Act. It just passed the 
Senate. Our bill protects American 
farmers and manufacturers by making 
it easier for them to ship ready-to-ex-
port goods waiting at our ports. Our 
bill aims to level the playing field for 
American exporters by updating the 
Federal rules for the global shipping 
industry. 
It will give the Federal Maritime 
Commission greater authority to regu-
late harmful practices by these big 
international carriers. It directs the 
Federal Maritime Commission to issue 
a rule prohibiting international ocean 
carriers from unreasonably declining 
shipping opportunities for U.S. exports. 
This will make it harder for them to 
leave our products behind, just sitting 
there at a port, in favor of shipping 
over to China, sailing over to China, 
and then bringing their products back 
to us. 
In addition to giving the FMC more 
authority to investigate bad practices 
by ocean carriers, the bill also directs 
the Federal Maritime Commission to 
set new rules for what the inter-
national carrier companies can reason-
ably charge and require them to certify 
and ultimately prove that fees that 
they charge are fair. As rates continue 
to climb, this is more urgent than ever.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1897 
March 31, 2022 
And I personally believe that, even 
before this rule goes into effect, the 
fact that we passed this unanimously 
in the U.S. Senate sent a pretty strong 
shot across the bow because there is so 
much more we could do and we will do 
if this practice continues. 
As I was working on this bill with 
Senator THUNE, I heard about exporters 
who wanted to speak out against these 
predatory practices but were scared 
into silence because they feared that 
the ocean carriers would retaliate. 
That is why our bill includes strong 
anti-retaliation protection for ship-
pers. In short, this bipartisan legisla-
tion says to the foreign-owned shipping 
alliances: Charge fair prices, stop prof-
iting off our backs, and fill your empty 
crates with American-made products. 
Senator THUNE and I have a bipar-
tisan group of 29 cosponsors rep-
resenting a variety of regions: Senators 
CANTWELL; WICKER; BALDWIN; HOEVEN; 
STABENOW; MARSHALL; PETERS; MORAN; 
BLUMENTHAL; YOUNG; KELLY; CRAPO; 
SMITH of Minnesota; BLACKBURN; BOOK-
ER; ERNST; CORTEZ
MASTO, the Pre-
siding Officer; BRAUN; WARNOCK; RISCH; 
BENNET; CRAMER; WYDEN; BLUNT; VAN 
HOLLEN; BOOZMAN; FISCHER; PADILLA; 
and HICKENLOOPER. 
The legislation earned the endorse-
ment of the American Association of 
Port 
Authorities, 
which 
represents 
more than 130 Port authorities across 
North and South America, including 
my own port of Duluth. This bill is also 
endorsed by more than 100 organiza-
tions, including the Agriculture Trans-
portation Coalition, the National Re-
tail Federation, the American Truck-
ing Associations, and the Consumer 
Technology Association. 
I also want to mention the House 
leaders on this bill—Representatives 
JOHN GARAMENDI and DUSTY JOHNSON of 
South Dakota—whose companion legis-
lation has already passed the House. I 
see this as a truly bipartisan solution 
to a problem that is impacting millions 
of Americans and a great example of 
what is possible when we work to-
gether. 
I 
want 
to 
congratulate 
Senator 
THUNE for his great leadership. He may 
be a bit taller than I, but we have 
worked together on many, many things 
across our borders. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, let 
me just join my friend and colleague 
and neighbor from across the border, 
Senator KLOBUCHAR, in just acknowl-
edging the passage of something that is 
really important and credit to her 
staff, who I know worked tirelessly on 
this, and members of my staff—in par-
ticular Chance Costello—who worked 
tirelessly trying to find that common 
ground and thread the needle to get 
this done in a way that would expedite 
its passage here in the Senate. 
As Senator KLOBUCHAR pointed out, 
the leadership on the Commerce Com-
mittee—Senators 
CANTWELL
and 
WICKER—and their staffs also were in-
strumental in helping us get this 
across the finish line. But as Senator 
KLOBUCHAR pointed out, I think this is 
a good example of how, if you are will-
ing to keep grinding and keep working 
at it, you can come up with solutions 
that are bipartisan and solutions that 
really get at problems that we are fac-
ing in this country. 
I don’t think anybody would argue 
that we have a supply chain crisis in 
America. It has heightened the impor-
tance of addressing some of these ship-
ping challenges; and our legislation, al-
though it may not be the end-all, cer-
tainly takes us a long way toward ad-
dressing what have been identified as 
many of the problems associated with 
trying to get the goods and products 
through our port system into the 
United States and, as importantly, try-
ing to get those products, those things 
that we raise and grow and manufac-
ture here in the United States, to their 
destinations around the world. 
And there have been lots of examples 
which Senator KLOBUCHAR has alluded 
to that she and I and our staffs have, in 
visiting with stakeholders out there, 
people who were impacted by these bot-
tlenecks that exist today—as we have 
listened to them, much of that input 
and feedback was incorporated into 
this legislation. 
So it does take strong measures to 
help tackle supply chain slowdowns, 
and it does level the playing field for 
American exporters, including South 
Dakota ag producers. It does this in 
several ways. She has covered it well, 
but let me just briefly touch on a cou-
ple of things. It does this by giving the 
FMC, or the Federal Maritime Com-
mission, new authorities to crack down 
on 
unfair 
ocean 
carrier 
practices, 
whether that is a refusal to carry cer-
tain cargoes or discrimination against 
certain commodities for export. 
We have all heard these examples— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR alluded to this—of 
containers leaving the ports in the 
United States that are empty, filled 
with air, or the carriers making deter-
minations based upon the value of cer-
tain products instead of—and then as-
sessing detention and demurrage fees 
sometimes on shippers that are unfair 
and unrelated, really, to anything that 
they have done. 
So providing the FMC with more 
tools to quickly resolve detention dis-
putes, bringing greater efficiency and 
transparency to a process that leaves 
many shippers frustrated—and espe-
cially small businesses—is what this 
legislation is all about. These improve-
ments, we believe, are going to bring 
long-term, positive changes to the mar-
itime supply chain, which I hope will 
benefit not only exporters but import-
ers and consumers alike. 
The legislation not only levels the 
playing field for producers in South 
Dakota and across the Nation, but it 
will also benefit exporters, small busi-
nesses, and, as I said, consumers across 
this country. 
So I hope, as she does, that our col-
leagues in the House will be able to 
take this up and pass it. There has been 
some good work done there already, 
much of it by my colleague in South 
Dakota, a Member of the congressional 
delegation 
from 
our 
State, 
DUSTY 
JOHNSON, who has been the leader on 
this legislation in the House of Rep-
resentatives when it passed earlier this 
year. And now, we have our chance 
here in the U.S. Senate. 
And it is a product of a tremendous 
amount of work. Senator KLOBUCHAR’s 
staff and my staff spent not weeks but 
months negotiating—and, you know, 
there are always disagreements. There 
are always differences. Of course, when 
you present it to the rest of our col-
leagues on the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee, they have their ideas, unique 
ideas, about things that they want to 
fix and change and make better. So it 
went through that process. 
But, ultimately, when we brought it 
up for consideration in front of the 
Senate Commerce Committee, there 
were some amendments that were of-
fered and voted on. People got a chance 
to have their voices heard. A lot of the 
ideas that people had were incor-
porated into the base text, but, ulti-
mately, when it was voted out, it was 
voted out of the Senate Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transportation 
Com-
mittee unanimously. It came out with-
out a dissenting vote, and that, I think, 
set us up here on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate to process in a way that, again, 
included a high level of bipartisanship. 
And I credit, too—as we brought it to 
the floor, there were a couple of issues 
we had to again deal with, individual 
Members who had concerns—some with 
the legislation, some with other issues. 
But as is always the case here in the 
U.S. Senate, an individual Senator can 
assert their rights in a way that en-
ables them, gives them leverage on the 
process; but we were able to work 
through those things, and that product 
today has now passed the U.S. Senate. 
Hopefully, if the House is inclined to 
do so, it would be great if they would 
pick it up, pass it, put it on the Presi-
dent’s desk, and have him sign it into 
law because I think it will take us a 
long way down the road toward lev-
eling that playing field and addressing 
many of the concerns that have been 
identified by our exporters. 
I know that the farm organizations 
in my State of South Dakota have been 
very active in influencing this, very 
concerned about the bottlenecks and 
their ability to reach export destina-
tions in a way that allows them to 
maximize their profitability and, in 
doing so, increase the prosperity of 
people all across the Midwest in States 
that we represent where agriculture is 
the No. 1 industry. 
So congrats to those who worked on 
this, again, to the staff who have la-
bored, and to my colleague from Min-
nesota. This is not the first time we 
have collaborated on issues. We share 
not only a border but, obviously, a lot 
of commonality in terms of the issues 
that impact our States; and this is one

in particular where I think the farm-
ers, ranchers, small business people, 
manufacturers in Minnesota and in 
South Dakota will all derive a benefit 
once it is enacted into law. 
We are going to do everything we can 
now to continue to press forward. We 
have gotten it this far. We need to now 
get some additional action by the 
House of Representatives. I am not 
sure exactly what that looks like, 
whether that is going to conference 
with them. Preferably, obviously, they 
pick up and pass this bill, put it on the 
President’s desk and turn it into law. 
I am pleased to be able to be a part 
of this and to get a result today. 
Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator 
yield? 
Mr. THUNE. I would be happy to 
yield to our colleague and the chair-
man of the Senate Ag Committee, who 
also has big equities in this discussion. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
thank Senator THUNE and Senator KLO-
BUCHAR. I know that the chair of the 
Commerce Committee is coming down 
to speak. 
I just wanted to say congratulations. 
Thank you for your wonderful leader-
ship on this. Obviously, with my hat on 
as chair of the Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry Committee, this is a big 
deal, as they would say. This is a very 
big deal to, certainly, all of our grow-
ers in Michigan but, I know, across the 
country. 
So thank you for your great bipar-
tisan work, and hopefully, we can get 
this all the way across the finish line. 
I know the President is anxious to sign 
it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, 
I, too, would like to come to the floor 
and thank my colleagues from the 
Upper Midwest for their great work on 
this legislation, the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act of 2022. 
Our colleagues from the Upper Mid-
west know how important agriculture 
products are, and they know how im-
portant it is for them to reach their 
destination. As Senator THUNE was the 
previous chair of the Commerce Com-
mittee, he knows all too well about 
how products can get boxed out be-
cause of other products on the rails. 
My colleague from Minnesota knows 
all too importantly about exports and 
has been a big supporter of our export 
economy in general and represents a 
State that is very robust on the global 
economy. So her leadership on a very 
tough issue has been very, very appre-
ciated. 
I would like to thank, from the Com-
merce Committee staff, a variety of 
people, and from Senator WICKER’s 
staff and from Senator THUNE’s. A lot 
of 
people 
worked 
on 
this: 
Nicki 
Teutschel, 
Alexis 
Gutierrez, 
Dave 
Stewart, 
Grace 
Bloom, 
Charles 
Vickery, 
Eric 
Vryheid, 
Michael 
Davisson, 
Matt 
Filpi, 
and 
Megan 
Thompson. From Senator WICKER’s 
staff: Andrew Neely, Fern Gibbons, 
Brendan 
Gavin, 
Paul 
Wasik, 
Kyle 
Fields. And from Senator KLOBUCHAR’s 
staff: Obviously Baz Selassie—couldn’t 
have done it without all of his hard 
work. He is really the guy behind this. 
And Senator THUNE’s staff: Chance Cos-
tello. And certainly Rob Hickman from 
Senator SCHUMER’s staff. 
So, today, the passage of this bipar-
tisan legislation couldn’t come at a 
more important time for our growers 
and producers and exporters; that is, 
today we are saying that American 
farmers matter, and their survival 
matters more than the exorbitant prof-
it of international shipping companies. 
That is what we really tried to tackle 
in this legislation. Our two colleagues 
brought forth this legislation in record 
time. It was passed in the House of 
Representatives, led by Congressmen 
GARAMENDI
and JOHNSON. Those two 
passed that in December, and our col-
leagues got this bill here in the Senate 
in February, and we were able to pass 
it now here at the very end of March. 
I thank again our two colleagues— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR for her leadership 
and Senator THUNE for getting it done 
so quickly. Literally, it was introduced 
in February and passed in March. I 
hope it is an example of what we can do 
on other legislation that is affecting 
our supply chain. 
Our economy is built on trading 
goods in a timely manner with our 
partnerships from all over the world. 
Anderson Hay Grain in Washington 
said: 
The agriculture economy in our region 
does not work if we don’t have competitive 
access to world markets. 
Right now, the supply chain isn’t 
working. Our ports have been clogged. 
Shipping companies have struggled to 
keep up with demand, and the costs for 
American exporters who are trying to 
get hay and milk and apples to the 
global market have gone through the 
roof. It is hurting our consumers here 
at home as they see prices increase, 
and it is hurting our exporters when 
they are looking at products that they 
are trying to get to market. 
American 
exporters 
are 
being 
charged more and more for containers 
due to shipping delays that are really 
out of their control. They are trying 
not to increase these costs. But, basi-
cally, consumers are paying more, and 
our exporters are having a tough time 
getting their products to market. 
According to the freight index, by 
September 2021, shipping a container 
had gone from $1,300 a container to 
$11,000 a container. Reports and news 
articles talk about how that has af-
fected our supply chains, that there 
have been increases in costs in con-
sumer electronics, like computers and 
other equipment, and in furniture and 
apparel. They are all seeing increases 
because of the increases in our shipping 
costs. 
The Federal Maritime Commission 
found that between July and Sep-
tember of 2021, American businesses 
were charged $2.2 billion in fees in addi-
tion to freight rates. That is a 50-per-
cent increase compared to the 3 prior 
months. 
Getting overcharged is only part of 
the problem. Some of our businesses 
can’t even get their containers on the 
ship. During 2021, there was a 24-per-
cent drop in full shipping containers 
leaving from the Ports of Seattle and 
Tacoma. That drop increased to 30 per-
cent in January and February of this 
year. That means 30 percent less con-
tainers are leaving for international 
markets that are full of American 
products. American exporters and their 
products are being left on the docks. 
That is why we wanted to act quickly. 
The American farmer, with growing 
season upon us, can’t afford to wait an-
other minute for the Federal Maritime 
Commission to do its job and help po-
lice this market and make sure that 
our products and our farmers are not 
being overcharged or left on the dock. 
The Washington State Potato Com-
mission reported an 11-percent decrease 
in exports in 2020 from 2019. According 
to Darigold, American dairy producers 
lost $1.5 billion last year due to port 
congestion and related challenges. 
All of this means that getting this 
legislation onto the President’s desk 
could not be more important. That is 
why we acted fast in moving this legis-
lation today to give the first reforms 
to the Federal Maritime Commission 
in two decades. Those new tools given 
to the Commission are to increase the 
rules to prevent American products 
from being left on the docks; increase 
transparency so that the fees the ship-
pers are charged are known and they 
can’t be overcharged; and three, pre-
vent the shipping companies from re-
taliating against our local American 
businesses. 
These three changes are significant 
changes to the authority, and the com-
mittee made sure in the changes to the 
legislation that these new rules need to 
be in place in the next few months. We 
cannot continue to wait for those rules 
to take place until next year. They 
need to be done now. That is why the 
Commerce Committee I am sure will 
work in a bipartisan fashion to see the 
implementation of this law and to 
make sure that the Commission is ag-
gressive in going after the exorbitant 
fees that are being charged by these 
international shipping companies. 
It is a huge task. The Commission is 
charged with regulating a $14 trillion 
international shipping industry. But 
this industry has done nothing but be-
come more concentrated in the last 
several decades. As the supply chain 
challenges unfold, it is clear that the 
Commission is left trying to rein in the 
practices of five very large inter-
national companies. That is why we 
had to act fast and we had to be aggres-
sive in making sure the Federal Mari-
time Commission would work to put 
rules in place that will help American 
ag exporters and help protect American 
consumers. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for 
their great work on this legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1899 
March 31, 2022 
The State of Washington desperately 
needed to see the Federal Maritime 
Commission reform. I am proud to say 
that we were able to get a new Federal 
Maritime Commissioner, Max Vekich— 
who I think will officially be sworn in 
soon—from the State of Washington, 
who has been working on the docks for 
40 years. He knows what it takes to 
move product. He also knows that we 
need aggressive action by the Federal 
Maritime Commission to protect all of 
us from these exorbitant shipping costs 
and to help us in making sure that 
products—good American exports, like 
our apples and hay and wheat—are not 
left on any dock but reach their des-
tination in foreign markets. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
before I give my remarks, I want to 
give a shout-out again to our great 
leader, the chair of the Commerce 
Committee, Senator CANTWELL. I don’t 
know if this is a record, but Senator 
CANTWELL
moved this bill so fast 
through the committee, it is amazing. 
It is just building on the great work of 
the committee with the Innovation and 
Competition Act and so on. 
Again, on behalf of all the farmers in 
Michigan and across the country, this 
is really important legislation.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

TRIBUTE TO LEAH SEIGLE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, before I get underway with the 
business that brings me to the floor, I 
would like to take a moment to say 
farewell and thank you to a member of 
my staff who is going on to other pur-
suits. Her name is Leah Seigle. She is 
right behind me, and she was my sched-
uler for many, many years. 
As every Senator knows, there is a 
special relationship between a Senator 
and a scheduler. They have to be on 
duty, more or less, 24/7 when we are up 
and about. They have to deal with our 
day-to-day life and how it integrates 
with our offices. They very often are 
close to and involved with our families, 
because of having to deal with keeping 
our family time extant and busy sched-
ules. 
So I want to say a word of apprecia-
tion to Leah. 
I don’t know how many speeches she 
has scheduled me here on the floor 
for—all the ‘‘Scheme’’ speeches, prob-
ably all of the ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ 
speeches, and this one today. This one 
today she actually gets to be here for 
and doesn’t have to watch on tele-
vision. 
So to Leah Seigle, thank you very 
much, and to schedulers everywhere, 
you are important to us. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Madam President, the reason I am 
here is to announce my intention to 
vote for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
to be an Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court and to congratulate her 
on the grace and dignity with which 
she withstood what Chairman DURBIN 
called her ‘‘trial by ordeal’’ in the Ju-
diciary Committee. 
Last week, Judge Jackson set the 
gold standard for patience and courtesy 
from a Supreme Court nominee. She 
demonstrated, hour after hour after 
often-agonizing hour, in plain view the 
qualities 
that 
Rhode 
Islander 
and 
Reagan First Circuit appointee Judge 
Bruce Selya has praised in her, an out-
standing legal mind, an exemplary ju-
diciary temperament, and a depth of 
experience in the courtroom that none 
of the sitting Justices possesses. 
Judge Jackson reminded us, through 
her personal story of perseverance and 
hope, how historic and important it is 
to have a Black woman about to serve 
on the U.S. Supreme Court. That story 
of perseverance and hope stretches 
back beyond Judge Jackson’s own life 
and work into the experience of Black 
women through American history, and 
it illuminates a brighter American fu-
ture. So I will be proud to cast my vote 
for her confirmation. 
During 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
hearing, there were persistent efforts 
to rewrite Judge Jackson’s own his-
tory, to assign to her beliefs she has 
never espoused. She dispensed with 
those attempts so effectively that I 
won’t dwell on them here. But there 
were other attempts in that hearing to 
rewrite history that I feel obliged to 
correct here today. 
The first is the notion that a Justice 
must have a ‘‘judicial philosophy.’’ 
That is news to me. If a nominee has a 
judicial philosophy, it is definitely fair 
game. It is important to explore that, 
and it is particularly important to ex-
plore that because predisposition can 
come masked as judicial philosophy. 
But I don’t see where a nominee has to 
have one, and I would actually suggest 
we are better off if judges don’t, be-
cause judicial philosophy can so easily 
be code for predisposition. 
Republicans persisted in that ‘‘judi-
cial philosophy’’ quest, asking about 
‘‘judicial philosophy’’ over 50 times. 
The favored theme appeared to be the 
so-called 
judicial 
philosophies 
of 
originalism and textualism, doctrines 
which illustrate my concern about pre-
disposition. 
The big, dark money donors who ush-
ered the last three Justices onto the 
Supreme Court love the backward look 
of originalism. A backward look to an 
era when industry regulation did not 
exist because big industry did not 
exist. Moreover, Republican Justices 
completely ignore originalism when it 
suits them. As I pointed out in com-
mittee, the entire vast structure of 
corporate political power in America 
erected by Republican Justices over 
years 
is 
a 
continuing 
affront 
to 
originalism. 
There was no corporate role in poli-
tics in the Constitution or the Phila-
delphia debates or the Federalist pa-
pers. Any of the customary wellsprings 
of originalism would say that this is a 
country to be run by we the people. But 
how happy—how happy—corporate po-
litical power makes big Republican do-
nors. So originalism goes out the win-
dow, and corporate power gets baked 
into our system. 
Unlike those judicial philosophies of 
predisposition 
and 
of 
convenience, 
Judge Jackson said her judicial philos-
ophy is her methodology—‘‘consist-
ently appl[y]’’ the ‘‘same level of ana-
lytical rigor’’ to a case ‘‘no matter who 
or what is involved in the legal ac-
tion.’’ For a judge, following your oath 
of office, the constitutional precedents 
of the Court, and the text of the Con-
stitution itself should suffice. You 
don’t need a judicial philosophy. 
So where did this Republican fascina-
tion with judicial philosophy come 
from? Here are talking points distrib-
uted 
by 
twinned 
rightwing, 
dark 
money influence groups, the so-called 
Independent Women’s Law Center and 
the affiliated so-called Independent 
Women’s Voice. These groups are tied 
in with Leonard Leo’s massive, secre-
tive $580 million-plus archipelago of 
front groups, like these, that make up 
the rightwing donors’ Court-capture 
operation. 
They sent these talking points to Re-
publican Senators even before Judge 
Jackson 
was 
selected. 
These 
dark 
money groups noted that ‘‘this nomi-
nee is likely to be a woman of color’’ 
and urged the Republicans not argue, 
‘‘that the president’s selection process 
led him to choose someone who may 
not be the best person for the job.’’ 
They said: 
It is . . . important that you focus not on 
the selection process or on the nominee’s 
paper qualifications, but rather on the need 
to learn more about the nominee’s judicial 
philosophy. 
The marching orders were clear, and 
50 efforts at ‘‘judicial philosophy’’ dis-
cussion later, we saw these talking 
points play out in that hearing. 
This rewrite of history, to presume 
that every nominee should have a judi-
cial philosophy, just because rightwing 
nominees have a fake judicial philos-
ophy of originalism that turns out to 
be sourced to rightwing dark money 
talking points, it seems to me to be an 
effort to erase the dangers of having a 
judicial philosophy, particularly a judi-
cial philosophy that masks predisposi-
tion and is selectively applied. 
Another rewrite of history came 
through the witness chosen to high-
light Judge Jackson’s amicus brief de-
fending a 2000 Massachusetts law estab-
lishing buffer zones for protests around 
abortion clinics. 
The witness was a sidewalk coun-
selor, someone who encourages women 
not to go in and exercise their rights. 
She seemed like a very nice woman, 
and she testified that she acted with 
compassion and love. But history and

S1900 
March 31, 2022 
my experience don’t align with that 
image of clinic protesters, as I recall 
personally. 
Crowds outside of clinics in Rhode Is-
land in those years leading up to the 
2000 law were hostile and intimidating, 
screaming and accusing of murder, to 
the point where patients coming in re-
quired 
security 
escorts 
to 
protect 
them. 
I remember pink sweatshirts that 
safety escorts wore outside Planned 
Parenthood so that patients could 
identify who was there to help them 
and then pass safely. 
Activists went back and forth be-
tween Massachusetts and Rhode Island 
to protest outside of clinics. 
On the morning of December 30, 1994, 
bad went to worse. A man walked into 
a pair of abortion clinics in Brookline, 
MA. At the first clinic, he shot and 
killed the receptionist with a modified 
semiautomatic rifle, then turned on 
others present—patients, their accom-
panying partners, staff. He left that 
clinic and traveled to the second clinic 
and there continued the slaughter. The 
man killed two people and wounded 
five others in this rampage, which 
shook New England to the core. 
I was the U.S. attorney when word 
came out of these shootings at clinics 
just 1 hour up the road and that the 
shooter was still at large. I thought 
Rhode Island might very well be next. 
So I went and stood outside the 
Planned Parenthood clinic just off the 
highway with my friend and Federal 
law enforcement colleague U.S. Mar-
shal Jack Leyden, and we stood there 
on that cold morning until a police 
cruiser could be posted outside. 
I will just say that the environment 
that led to Massachusetts’ buffer zone 
law passing in 2000 was not an atmos-
phere of compassion and love, and it is 
a disservice to the facts to try to re-
write history and pretend that it was. 
Another rewrite of history that took 
place in this hearing was a rewrite of 
the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. 
The Judiciary Committee had been 
provided evidence in those hearings 
that young Brett Kavanaugh was an 
out-of-control drinker with a bad his-
tory of behavior around women—most 
particularly the testimony of this 
woman that she had been physically 
assaulted as a young woman. 
You would never know of her testi-
mony from the history rewrite offered 
by Republicans in the recent hearings. 
You would never know that she came 
to the Judiciary Committee; that she 
testified under oath and intense public 
scrutiny; that she weathered the atten-
tions of a professional prosecutor hired 
by the Republicans; that she was calm 
and credible. 
And you would never know that the 
FBI tanked its supplemental back-
ground investigation into these allega-
tions, including a tip line whose tips 
received zero FBI investigation. I have 
described it before as a tip dump, not a 
tip line. 
The tips related to the nominee were 
segregated from the regular stream of 
tips in the FBI tip line and sent, with-
out investigation, to the White House. 
Republicans sought to erase all of 
that by rewriting Kavanaugh hearing 
history during this Supreme Court 
hearing. Well, she has a face and she 
has a name: Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. 
And the big rewrite—the big rewrite 
is to ignore all the evidence that our 
Supreme Court is now a captured 
Court, captured in the same way that 
Agencies and Commissions are some-
times captured by big special interests. 
There is a whole literature in admin-
istrative law, there is a whole lit-
erature in economics about Agency 
capture or regulatory capture. 
Well, even before the Trump Presi-
dency, big, powerful, rightwing donor 
interests began spending massive sums 
of money to install Justices on the Su-
preme Court whom they expected to 
rule reliably in their favor. 
Very often, as the Presiding Officer 
knows, if you can pick the judges, you 
can pick the winner. 
The 5-to-4 and now 6-to-3 Republican 
majority on the Court has been stead-
ily delivering for those big donors; over 
80—eight, zero—80 5-to-4 partisan wins 
for big corporate and partisan donor in-
terests under Chief Justice Roberts. 
In those 5-to-4 partisan decisions, by 
the way, where there was an identifi-
able Republican donor interest in-
volved, it wasn’t just the 80 decisions 
that stood out; it was the fact that the 
score was 80-to-0. Every single one 
went their way. 
Dark money lurked behind the Fed-
eralist Society turnstile that picked 
the Justices. Dark money lurked be-
hind the secretive Agency down the 
hall from the Federalist Society that 
ran the ads for them. Dark money 
lurks behind the flotillas of front group 
amici curiae that tell the Justices, in 
orchestrated chorus, how to rule. 
You would never know any of this 
from our Republican friends in the 
committee. 
But the American people have seen 
those decisions, and more and more 
they understand that the Court is 
rigged; that it is now the Court that 
dark money built. 
Judge Jackson, by contrast, is a 
walking reminder of what the Court 
ought to be. She didn’t pass through 
the dark money-funded turnstile at the 
Federalist Society. She arrived after a 
lifetime of accomplishment, against 
unimaginable odds, through a fair and 
honest selection process, through her 
merit and abilities. 
The attacks on her in the committee 
were unseemly, but there is no need to 
dwell on that because at the end of the 
day, they were sound and fury, signi-
fying nothing. 
Judge Jackson will excel on the Su-
preme Court, and I will proudly cast 
my vote to put her there. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
IRAN 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, Donald 
Trump relit the fuse that leads to an 
Iranian nuclear bomb by abandoning 
the Iran nuclear deal. Now Republicans 
are urging President Joe Biden to let it 
go boom. 
President Barack Obama crafted the 
Iran nuclear deal in 2015 to prevent an 
Iranian nuclear weapon. He had inher-
ited two quagmires in Afghanistan and 
Iraq, and he was right to prioritize di-
plomacy to prevent us from falling into 
a third quagmire. 
Donald Trump’s unilateral exit from 
the Iranian deal in 2013 created a nu-
clear crisis where one did not exist. In 
the years since that withdrawal, Iran 
has crept closer to a bomb, restricted 
access to international inspectors, and 
set us on a potential collision course to 
war with Iran. 
Our European allies wanted to build 
upon the Iran nuclear deal, but Presi-
dent Trump and his arms control assas-
sin, John Bolton, used it as target 
practice, leaving the Biden administra-
tion and our allies to pick up the 
pieces. 
On the Republicans’ watch, Iran’s 
breakout time, or time required to 
build enough nuclear material for its 
first nuclear bomb, went from more 
than 1 year down to just weeks. 
There is simply no good alternative 
to reentering the Iran nuclear deal. 
Trump has already tried the alter-
native. It has failed miserably and 
made the United States more vulner-
able and made the Middle East more 
vulnerable. 
Then-Secretary 
of 
State 
Mike 
Pompeo laid out a series of demands 
for Iran in 2018 that read more like a 
fantasy novel than a foreign policy 
speech. And where did it get us? Abso-
lutely nowhere, except it got Iran clos-
er to a nuclear weapon than it has ever 
been before. 
No, the reality is that the alternative 
to diplomacy, our Plan B, is likely to 
include more sanctions which will lead 
to more enrichment of uranium and 
the prospect of another Middle East 
conflagration. In short, Plan B stands 
for ‘‘Plan Bad.’’ That is what is being 
urged by the Republican Party, by the 
Trump supporters. ‘‘Plan Bad’’ would 
endorse Trump’s disastrous policy of 
‘‘maximum pressure,’’ one that gave us 
maximum enrichment of uranium and 
other activities prohibited under the 
Iran nuclear deal. 
Plan B means that China’s reported 
work to give Saudi Arabia—Iran’s nem-
esis—the building blocks for a nuclear 
weapon will only accelerate, and other 
Gulf countries will jump into the race 
for a nuclear bomb as well. 
Plan B means that Iran’s nuclear fa-
cilities that are above ground will go 
underground.

S1901 
March 31, 2022 
Plan B means that cameras and 
international inspectors that keep a 
continuous eye on Iran’s facilities will 
be shuttered permanently, leaving us 
in the dark about Iran’s nuclear inten-
tions. 
Under Trump, we saw ‘‘maximum 
pressure’’ generate ‘‘maximum ten-
sion’’ that put us on a perilous path to 
war. Trump’s Plan B to diplomacy was 
and continues to be a complete failure. 
Indeed, we saw this in 2019, when ten-
sions rose to a decades-long high with 
the assassinations of Qasem Soleimani, 
followed by Iran’s retaliatory strike 
that injured 200 U.S. troops at an Air 
Force base in Iraq. Never had we been 
closer to a war with Iran. 
If the sides currently negotiating a 
new Iran deal are unable to get to yes 
on a deal, I fear that we will see in-
creasing calls from my Republican col-
leagues to take military action against 
Iran. That is not a good option. 
My Republican colleagues need to be 
honest with the war-weary American 
people that doubling down on the failed 
policies of the Trump era will likely 
lead Iran to retaliate by lobbing great-
er numbers of missiles at our troops or 
at the region’s energy infrastructure. 
Iran will double down on these failed 
policies, and that may lead to Iran cre-
ating a sea wall to stop traffic in the 
Strait of Hormuz, creating more of a 
supply chain pain. And my colleagues 
need to be honest that doubling down 
on these policies risks adding to the 
number of Gold Star mothers who have 
lost children to unnecessary wars far 
from home. And, perhaps, most impor-
tantly, my colleagues should be honest 
with the American people that these 
failed policies have led Iran closer to a 
nuclear 
weapon—not 
further 
away 
from a nuclear weapon, closer to a nu-
clear weapon—day by day, week by 
week that we have followed the Trump 
plan. 
These are life-and-death stakes. Dou-
bling down on the failed policies of 
Trump and expecting a different result 
in Iran is truly the definition of insan-
ity. 
The Iran nuclear deal is not a pan-
acea nor was it ever intended to be a 
panacea. What it is, is a verifiable 
agreement that cuts off each of Iran’s 
three pathways to a nuclear bomb. 
First, Iran will, again, have to cap its 
enrichment level and ship out its stock 
of enriched uranium that would other-
wise be potential feedstock for a nu-
clear bomb. 
Second, Iran will finish the conver-
sion of its Arak reactor, which will 
close off its plutonium path to a nu-
clear bomb. 
And, third, and most importantly, in-
spectors from the international watch-
dog agency, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, will once again get ac-
cess to the soup to nuts of Iran’s nu-
clear fuel cycle. 
If we listen to the same voices who 
rejected a good deal in search of the 
impossible, 
who 
preached 
brinksmanship over diplomacy, we will 
find ourselves stuck, as we are today, 
with an Iran that could have the ulti-
mate weapon to back its coercion—a 
nuclear bomb. 
Fortunately, this screenplay does not 
have to end with American men and 
women marching off to another war in 
the Middle East, and it does not have 
to end with Iran entering the worst of 
exclusive clubs, those with nuclear 
weapons. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 
recent 
nuclear 
saber 
rattling 
has 
brought home the stakes of nuclear di-
plomacy with Iran. A homicidal leader 
armed with weapons of annihilation is 
a threat to global peace. 
When Putin ordered an increase in 
the alert level of Russia’s nuclear 
forces a couple of weeks ago, he post-
poned U.S. intercontinental ballistic 
missile tests for fear that, in the fog of 
war, Russia could misinterpret an 
ICBM launch off the coast of California 
as a first nuclear strike against Russia. 
That also explains President Biden’s 
reticence to impose a NATO-enforced 
no-fly zone over Ukraine. 
Putin is failing. Ukraine and its peo-
ple are winning, with our help. Every 
fabricated 
justification 
for 
Putin’s 
senseless and illegal war has crumbled. 
But a direct U.S.-NATO military inter-
vention would pull the world’s two 
largest nuclear powers closer to a war. 
No simulation, no exercise, no war 
game can assure us that such a war 
does not metastasize to engulf all of 
Europe and lead to the use of nuclear 
weapons. 
Mr. President, here is the scary re-
ality: Vladimir Putin could kill mil-
lions upon millions of Americans right 
now using a fraction of his 4,500 nu-
clear weapons. That is the perennial 
threat of nuclear arms. 
Conventional logic says that we are 
safe because a Russian nuclear strike 
would be both homicidal and suicidal 
for Putin, but we cannot bank on the 
fact that Putin, the pariah, has a 
moral basement. President George W. 
Bush famously said he looked into 
Vladimir Putin’s eyes and he saw his 
soul. Thank goodness President Biden 
sees it for the dark space that it is. 
As a result, Russia’s war in Ukraine 
calls on us to challenge tired, old Cold 
War assumptions that basing our nu-
clear posture on the balance of terror 
and relying on the rationality of our 
leaders will keep the peace—no, it will 
not. That assumption has to be com-
pletely reanalyzed in view of what 
Putin is doing right now, that pursuing 
President Reagan’s star wars fantasy 
to knock out nuclear-tipped missiles in 
space before they fall on American cit-
ies is wise; it is not. There is no guar-
antee that some of those nuclear weap-
ons would not come and destroy Amer-
ican cities and that we should spend a 
quarter of a trillion dollars to replace 
the very same U.S. intercontinental 
ballistic missiles that the President 
won’t even test during a conflict due to 
fears of escalation; we should not. 
Unfortunately, our American democ-
racy and Russia’s autocracy do share 
one major thing in common: Both our 
systems give the United States and 
Russian Presidents the God-like powers 
known as sole authority to end life on 
the planet as we know it by ordering a 
nuclear first strike. 
As President Richard Nixon grimly 
described these powers once: 
I can go into my office and pick up the 
telephone and in 25 minutes, 70 million peo-
ple will be dead. 
We know all too well that American 
Presidents are not infallible, neither is 
our early warning system, which is 
why we need an emergency break to 
ensure that a case of mistaken iden-
tity—a false missile launch—or a Presi-
dent gone wild does not trigger the un-
thinkable. 
We cannot uninvent the atom, its 
military 
applications, 
and 
techno-
logical know-how. The nuclear Pan-
dora’s box is sadly forever opened. We 
must, however, do everything in our 
power to be able to look the next gen-
eration in the eye and say that we did 
everything—everything—in our power 
to avert the unfathomable, a nuclear 
war on this planet; and that includes 
supporting negotiations that not only 
end Russia’s war in Ukraine, but also 
future negotiations to end the budding 
21st century nuclear arms race which is 
spinning out of control. 
Mr. President, I was a teenager dur-
ing the Cuban Missile Crisis. Had Presi-
dent Kennedy listened to his generals 
rather than to his better angels, we 
might not be here today. This building 
might not be here. ‘‘Bert the Turtle’’ 
public service advertisements told us 
to duck and cover under our school 
desks. Backpack nukes designed to 
repel the Soviet advance on West Ger-
many rolled off the assembly lines. 
U.S. and Soviet leaders were awoken in 
the middle of the night to false alarms 
of nuclear Armageddon. These events 
must forever belong to our past, not to 
our future. 
A future held together by the fear of 
annihilation is a burden, not an inspi-
ration. But Congress can shape a safer 
more inspiring future by supporting 
President Biden’s efforts to reenter a 
good Iran nuclear deal, and we can and 
we must hold ourselves to a higher 
standard than Russia when it comes to 
resting the fate of humanity in the 
hands of just one human being. 
This is a subject that should com-
mand the attention of every single 
American. We have to move further 
away from the threat of a nuclear ca-
tastrophe, not get closer to it; and that 
is why we must support a reentry into 
a good Iran nuclear deal. The alter-
native is frightening for the future, not 
just of the Middle East, but for our 
country and the entire planet.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO BRIAN W. NESS 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH, 
Representative MIKE SIMPSON and Rep-
resentative RUSS
FULCHER, we con-
gratulate Brian Ness on his retirement 
after 13 years of outstanding service as 
director of the Idaho Transportation 
Department, ITD. 
In 2009, Brian Ness was appointed to 
serve as director of the Idaho Transpor-
tation Department, and he has been re-
sponsible for an annual budget of ap-
proximately $800 million and leading 
1,650 employees. We have greatly val-
ued his input on advancing Idaho 
transportation 
priorities, 
including 
through the Federal appropriations 
process and other infrastructure-re-
lated proposals. He also testified before 
the U.S. House of Representatives Sub-
committee on Research and Tech-
nology in 2019 on ‘‘The Need for a Na-
tional 
Surface 
Transportation 
Re-
search Agenda.’’ 
Director Ness has devoted consider-
able time utilizing his experience as a 
transportation 
professional 
to 
help 
lead a number of related organizations. 
He has served on the boards of direc-
tors and in many other leadership roles 
for the American Association of State 
Highway and Transportation Officials, 
AASHTO; the Western Association of 
State Highway and Transportation Of-
ficials, WASHTO; the Transportation 
Research Board, TRB; the American 
Road and Transportation Builders As-
sociation, ARTBA; and the Idaho Rural 
Partnership. His leadership roles in-
clude the Governor appointing Director 
Ness to chair the Idaho Autonomous 
and Connected Vehicle Testing and De-
ployment Committee. Additionally, in 
2019, Director Ness became president of 
the ARTBA’s Transportation Officials 
Division. He also served as president of 
WASHTO in 2015. 
Throughout his career, he has earned 
many recognitions for his remarkable 
work and led teams that have received 
many honors. For example, since Di-
rector Ness joined the ITD, it has re-
ceived nearly 170 national awards for 
its programs and projects, including 
the prestigious Francis B. Francois 
Award for Innovation. ITD has also 
won an extraordinary 17 AASHTO 
President’s Transportation Awards. Di-
rector Ness also received the 2016 Navi-
gator Award from the national organi-
zation, Route Fifty; was named Trine 
University’s—formerly Tri-State Uni-
versity—2014 
Alumni 
of 
the 
Year; 
AASHTO’s President’s Award for Ad-
ministration in 2013; and was honored 
in 2012 as Leader of the Year by the 
Treasure Valley Chapter of Women’s 
Transportation Seminar. 
Before becoming director at ITD, Di-
rector Ness worked for 30 years at the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 
Transpor-
tation, holding a variety of positions in 
research, operations, aeronautics, con-
struction, and project development. He 
earned a bachelor of science degree in 
civil engineering from Tri-State Uni-
versity and a master’s degree in public 
administration from Western Michigan 
University, and he is a licensed profes-
sional engineer in Michigan and Idaho. 
We understand the ITD’s employee- 
driven innovation program started dur-
ing Director Ness’s leadership is cred-
ited with saving nearly $35 million, cre-
ating 691 customer-service improve-
ments, and saving 540,000 contractor 
and employee hours. Thank you, Brian, 
for your focus on ingenuity, efficiency, 
accountability, and results all these 
years at the helm of the ITD. Your 
work to empower employee-driven in-
novation and support emerging leaders 
will no doubt have lasting effects on 
government efficiency and countless 
individual careers. Thank you, espe-
cially, for your service to Idaho, the 
transportation department and its em-
ployees, and congratulations on your 
retirement.∑

RECOGNIZING KELSEY’S ON MAIN 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Kelsey’s On 
Main of Jackson, KY, as the Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
Like a good Southerner, Kelsey Se-
bastian is passionate about hospitality. 
After leaving her native Jackson, she 
pursued a degree in hospitality man-
agement and tourism from University 
of Kentucky. However, instead of tak-
ing her university expertise to the op-
portunities of the big city, Kelsey re-
turned home to put her knowledge and 
skills to work. Thus in 2014, with the 
help of her family, Kelsey Sebastian 
opened Kelsey’s On Main. 
The idea for Kelsey’s On Main was 
born out of several needs for the little 
town of Jackson. With only a small 
number of sit-in dining establishments 
in Jackson, local residents needed 
more restaurant options. Moreover, 
there was a need for revitalization in 
the heart of downtown Jackson, a 
heady mission that Kelsey and her 
family bravely took on. The Hogg 
building, now home to Kelsey’s On 
Main, was 98 years old when she and 
her family began the renovation proc-
ess in 2012. A former pharmacy and 
pool hall, this historic building located 
in the center of downtown needed a 
healthy dose of tender love and care. 
Renovating the establishment was by 
no means an easy task but the town of 
Jackson and its residents will tell you 
that it was worth it. In 2014, the cen-
tennial anniversary of the Hogg build-
ing, Kelsey’s On Main opened their 
doors. 
Kelsey’s desire to restore beauty to 
the dilapidated old Hogg building cor-
responded with her mission to provide 
great food and top quality service to 
her hometown. In keeping the original 
tin roof and leaving one of the old 
walls exposed in its brick, customers 
can see that this building is mature in 
age but well taken care of. To that end, 
Kelsey and her family keep old photos 
of downtown Jackson as well as photos 
of her friends and family throughout 
the historic building. Of course, her 
family is not just present in the photo-
graphs that hang on the wall; her par-
ents often come by to pick up a shift or 
two to support their daughter. And as a 
tenant in her aunt’s building, Kelsey’s 
On Main is a true family affair. 
Returning to Jackson to open her 
own business is not the only way 
Kelsey supports her community. She is 
an active member of the Jackson Wom-
en’s Group and as a Jackson City Coun-
cil member, Kelsey always volunteers 
her restaurant to host the monthly 
Jackson Chamber of Commerce lunch. 
Kelsey is also involved in the Breathitt 
County Honey Festival, a tradition 
that has been around for over four dec-
ades, by supporting the festival’s musi-
cal committee. As someone so involved 
in the goings-on of her town, Kelsey 
does her best to bring life to the Jack-
son community, as illustrated by she 
and her family’s decision to revitalize 
a historic downtown building. More-
over, as a recent participant in Ken-
tucky’s BRIGHT program, a profes-
sional and entrepreneurial develop-
ment program, it is clear that Kelsey is 
headstrong in her desire to keep im-
proving and impacting the community 
around her. 
All across the country are little 
towns like Jackson whose downtowns 
have been left empty by a shift in in-
dustry, 
and 
it 
is 
businesses 
like 
Kelsey’s On Main that bring life back 
into those empty storefronts and keep 
historic communities thriving. 
Congratulations to Kelsey and her 
family and the entire team at Kelsey’s 
On Main. I wish them the best of luck 
and look forward to watching their 
continued growth and success in Ken-
tucky.∑

S. 3979. A bill to amend the Families 
First Coronavirus Response Act to ex-
tend child nutrition waiver authority; 
to the Committee on Agriculture, Nu-
trition, and Forestry. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as 
the pandemic began, Congress, on a bi-
partisan basis, made sure our schools 
and our summer meal programs had 
easy-to-use flexibilities so they could 
continue to feed hungry children who 
were no longer physically in school or 
no longer able to go to a meal site in 
the summer because of COVID. 
All across America now, because of a 
lot of hard work on a lot of people’s 
part, our kids are now back in school, 
which is great. But 90 percent of our 
schools are still struggling to provide 
children healthy food as a result of 
higher food prices, less available staff, 
and more supply chain delays and 
shortages that we know about all the 
time. In fact, part of that relates to 
this bill which was just passed on ship-
ping. This is part of the supply chain 
breakdown that has affected the ability 
for our schools to be able to get what 
they need for our children. 
We have 90 percent—all this in red, 
across the country—of the States say-
ing: We need these flexibilities that 
have been in place from the very begin-
ning of COVID. We extended the flexi-
bilities before, and they need them to 
continue to be able to feed children in 
our country. School cafeterias, summer 
meal providers—everybody is working 
as hard as they can to get back to nor-
mal, but they need time to transition 
so our children aren’t hurt in the proc-
ess. The USDA, school administrators, 
local mayors, even school food sup-
pliers themselves have said they need 
these flexibilities to continue for an-
other year. 
Back in January, the Agricultural 
Secretary, Secretary Vilsack, called on 
Congress to once again extend what we 
call the nutrition waivers so that 
schools and meal providers had the 
flexibility they need to feed hungry 
children who may have their only meal 
at school or their only breakfast or 
their only lunch at school or, in the 
summer, through the feeding programs. 
We have been working in good faith, 
as we always do, across the aisle to 
make this extension happens. We were 
working on having that happen as part 
of the omnibus. It was a real shock to 
me and to many of the Senators who 
care deeply about our children when 
Republican Leader MCCONNELL refused 
to agree to extending the school nutri-
tion flexibilities as part of the omnibus 
bill that we just passed, that we know 
was critically important to pass. We 
don’t want the government to shut 
down. We had essential, critical re-
sources for Ukraine and so many other 
issues. But our kids were left behind in 
this one, and it is not right. We need to 
fix it. 
We are in a critical transition period 
right now, but we are not out of the 
pandemic yet. Without having these 
flexibilities extended, without this sup-
port, up to 30 million children who get 
their food, their only healthy meals at 
school will see their breakfast and 
lunch disrupted, and that makes abso-
lutely no sense. Millions of kids will 
show up at their summer meal program 
this July and could very well see a 
‘‘closed’’ sign. 
That is why, today, Senator LISA 
MURKOWSKI and I are introducing the 
Support Kids Not Red Tape Act, along 
with Senator COLLINS and all 50 Mem-
bers of our Democratic caucus. 
Let me stress that this is a tem-
porary extension with a clear end date 
and a lot of procedures put in place to 
safely get schools and summer meal 
programs back to normal operations. 
We want to give them time to transi-
tion. 
I am so grateful for our colleagues’ 
support—52 colleagues. We only need 
eight more. We only need eight more 
Republicans to join us to get this done 
right away, just like we did the ship-
ping bill. 
Our schools need time. Our kids need 
time right now rather than having this 
abruptly end June 30, which is not very 
far away. So let’s be clear. To abruptly 
pull the lunch tray away from hungry 
kids at the end of June is just plain 
wrong. 
Since the pandemic started in March 
2020, food insecurity for families and 
their children has jumped by nearly 
two-thirds. We all know the stories. We 
have all seen the lines. People across 
the country are engaging to support 
each other. One in five kids comes to 
school hungry, and school and summer 
programs may be the only meal that 
they get. During the pandemic, it was 
even worse. Now, because of all the 
challenges continuing, we are not out 
of the woods on this yet in terms of 
feeding our children. 
How have these flexibilities helped 
our children be able to get healthy 
meals? One example is in Rapid City, 
SD, where the local school district has 
partnered with Meals on Wheels in the 
summer to deliver meals to where the 
kids are. It makes sense. This has been 
a lifesaver for hungry children in their 
rural communities who had no way to 
get to the one school meal site that 
was miles and miles away. 
In Arkansas, the food insecurity rate 
among children skyrocketed to over 32 
percent during the pandemic, 32 per-
cent of the children being food inse-
cure, not being able to have a healthy 
meal. 
Fayetteville and Bentonville schools’ 
summer meals programs have provided 
weekly meal pack pickups with a 
week’s worth of breakfast and lunch. 
So rather than a parent who is working 
trying to figure out, how do I get my 
child to a place to get a healthy break-
fast, and by the way, I may have to 
take them back again for a healthy 
lunch—by the way, in the rural com-
munity, there is not a lot of public 
transportation. It certainly affects ev-
eryone in urban areas, suburban areas, 
and rural areas, but the distances in 
rural communities are an extra burden 
oftentimes. So they put together the 
capacity to do a week’s worth. Those 
were the flexibilities we gave them 
that we want to continue. 
In Edgecombe County, NC, resource-
ful schools found a way to get meals to 
100 kids during the summer by using

the schoolbus. The schoolbus wasn’t 
being used, so they put the food on a 
schoolbus and went out to the neigh-
borhoods, out to the kids. 
As a result of these flexibilities, 
twice as many kids got summer meals 
during the pandemic, which is some-
thing we also need to learn from. Just 
as we have learned the importance of 
high-speed internet after the pandemic, 
and we have addressed that, which is 
great, we have now learned that we 
need to rethink some of these things 
here, in terms of the flexibilities for 
our schools and how we deliver summer 
meals, how we address schools during 
the school year. 
So it goes to show you what a big dif-
ference it makes for hungry kids when 
we don’t make them or their families 
or their meal providers jump through 
all kinds of hoops to get something as 
basic as a healthy meal. 
In schools across Kentucky, from 
smalltown Madison County to me-
tropolis Jefferson County, these flexi-
bilities have kept kids from getting 
caught in the redtape and going hungry 
if their struggling parent just missed 
one piece of paper on a form. 
It has been a relief to school food 
service directors in small towns who 
are already working with half the staff, 
twice the stress of putting together 
healthy meals with all the food and 
supply chain shortages we have talked 
about. 
Right now, school food service direc-
tors in Utah are placing orders for next 
year, knowing that many of the items 
they need are currently not available 
and the ones they can find have dou-
bled in price. 
The flexibilities and increased fund-
ing to deal with these costs—the things 
we have given them to deal with this— 
have made it possible to make substi-
tutions when basic items like ground 
beef are not available or fruit is not 
available, to be able to put together 
something healthy in a different way. 
Losing these flexibilities will cut 
their budgets by 40 percent and force 
meal providers to make pretty dire 
choices on which children to feed and 
how schools are going to pay for it. 
Without our bill to support kids and 
cut redtape, all of these desperately 
needed flexibilities are going to go 
away at the end of June. They are just 
going to go away—all the support for 
schools, all the support for children, all 
the new creative things that have been 
able to be done to help children get 
healthy meals, done. 
School meals, summer programs will 
have to scale back. Some will have to 
stop feeding kids altogether. Children 
will once again go hungry because of 
paperwork and bureaucracy outside of 
their control. I mean, you think about 
this: Are we on the side of bureaucracy 
or are we on the side of kids? 
This legislation is on the side of kids. 
My colleagues supporting this bill and 
sponsoring this are on the side of kids, 
not redtape. 
The unnecessary stress is going to be 
felt by families in every part of our 
country, from small towns to big cit-
ies, to suburban areas. So our bill gives 
us a clear, easy path forward to make 
sure children and to make sure schools 
have the time and the support they 
need to get back on their feet as we re-
cover from the pandemic and to be able 
to plan for how this phases out. 
Schools across the country are telling 
us that these flexibilities are critical 
to continuing—absolutely critical. 
So it is time for us to listen to them 
and to do the right thing for our chil-
dren. I urge my colleagues to pass the 
Support Kids Not Red Tape Act as soon 
as possible.

IN 
UNITED 
STATES V. ROBERTSON, ET AL 
Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. 
MCCONNELL) submitted the following

S. RES. 573 
Whereas, in the case of United States v. Rob-

the Secretary of the Senate, and from Nate 
Russell and Diego Torres, custodians of 
records in the Senate Recording Studio, a de-
partment of the Office of the Sergeant at 
Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate; 
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 
704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government Act of

Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of 
the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-

SENATE RESOLUTION 574—DESIG-
NATING MAY 2, 2022, AS ‘‘DR. 
JOHN E. FRYER DAY’’ 
Mr. CASEY (for himself and Ms. 
BALDWIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 574 
Whereas Dr. John E. Fryer practiced psy-
chiatry in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 
1967 to 2003, and was a professor of psychi-
atry and family and community medicine at 
Temple University School of Medicine; 
Whereas, beginning in 1952, the American 
Psychiatric Association (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘APA’’) classified homosex-
uality as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘DSM’’) and in the revised 
DSM-II; 
Whereas, as a result of the classification 
and resulting therapeutic protocol, homo-
sexuals in the United States were subject to 
chemical castration, electric shock therapy, 
mental institutionalization, and lobotomies; 
Whereas the classification was used to de-
monize 
homosexuals 
and 
other 
non- 
heterosexuals as perverts to be feared and 
loathed and to buttress homophobic statutes 
and regulations; 
Whereas many States would not grant pro-
fessional licenses to known homosexuals and 
would revoke licenses from individuals who 
were later found to be homosexual; 
Whereas, in 1971, gay rights pioneers Frank 
Kameny and Barbara Gittings successfully 
petitioned the APA for a panel on homosex-
uality at the APA annual meeting; 
Whereas Kameny and Gittings sought to 
have a gay psychiatrist on the panel, but no 
one would risk losing their license and pro-
fessional standing by admitting publicly to 
being homosexual; 
Whereas Dr. Fryer agreed to appear on the 
panel under the pseudonym of Dr. Henry 
Anonymous, while in a mask and using a 
voice modulator; 
Whereas Dr. Fryer’s testimony on May 2, 
1972, at the APA annual meeting was so pow-
erful that the APA undertook studies to de-
termine whether the classification of homo-
sexuality as a mental illness was based on 
science or prejudice; 
Whereas, in 1973, after study and review, 
the members of the APA voted to declassify 
homosexuality as a mental illness; 
Whereas, as a result of Dr. John E. Fryer’s 
courage and articulate presentation as the 
first psychiatrist in the United States to 
speak publicly about his homosexuality, the 
course of civil rights for individuals who are 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
queer (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘LGBTQ’’) was seminally advanced; 
Whereas, 
during 
the 
human 
immuno-
deficiency 
virus 
and 
acquired 
immuno-
deficiency syndrome (referred to in this pre-
amble ‘‘HIV/AIDS’’) crisis, Dr. John Fryer 
was among the first, if not the first, psychia-
trists to provide professional services to in-
dividuals with HIV/AIDS and individuals who 
had lost loved ones to HIV/AIDS; 
Whereas Dr. John Fryer’s contributions to 
the LGBTQ community have been adapted 
into the celebrated theater production enti-
tled ‘‘217 Boxes of Dr. Henry Anonymous’’ 
and the movie ‘‘CURED’’; 
Whereas the Philadelphia Historical Com-
mission has designated the John. E. Fryer 
House at 138 West Walnut Lane, Philadel-
phia, Pennsylvania, as historic in the Phila-
delphia Register of Historic Places; 
Whereas the Philadelphia City Council pro-
claimed May 2, 2022, as John Fryer Day in 
the city of Philadelphia to mark the 50th an-
niversary of his testimony on homosexuality 
at the 1972 APA annual meeting and to com-
memorate 
his 
momentous 
and 
seminal 
LGBTQ civil rights activism; and 
Whereas Dr. John Fryer is a civil rights 
hero and was designated by the Equality 
Forum as an LGBT History Month Icon in 
2016: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 2, 2022, as ‘‘Dr. John E. 
Fryer Day’’; and 
(2) encourages the Federal Government, 
States, and localities to continue supporting 
the 
teaching 
of 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) history, including 
the contributions of Dr. John E. Fryer and 
other LGBTQ civil rights heroes.

the following concurrent resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 
S. CON. RES. 35 
Whereas International Transgender Day of 
Visibility was founded in 2009 to honor the 
achievements 
and 
contributions 
of 
the 
transgender community; 
Whereas International Transgender Day of 
Visibility is designed to be encompassing of 
a large community of individuals, including 
individuals who identify as nonbinary, gen-
der-nonconforming, and gender-diverse; 
Whereas International Transgender Day of 
Visibility is a time to celebrate the lives and 
achievements 
of 
transgender, nonbinary, 
gender-nonconforming, and gender-diverse 
individuals around the world, and to recog-
nize the bravery it takes to live openly and 
authentically; 
Whereas International Transgender Day of 
Visibility is also a time to raise awareness of 
the discrimination and violence that the 
transgender community still faces, which 
make it difficult and even unsafe or fatal for 
many transgender individuals to be visible; 
Whereas the transgender community has 
suffered oppression disproportionately in 
many ways, including— 
(1) discrimination in the workplace; 
(2) discrimination in educational institu-
tions; and 
(3) subjection to violence; 
Whereas forms of transgender oppression 
are exacerbated for transgender individuals 
of color, individuals with limited resources, 
immigrants, individuals living with disabil-
ities, 
justice-involved 
individuals, 
and 
transgender youth; 
Whereas 
a 
record 
number 
of 
anti- 
transgender State bills have been introduced 
in recent years; 
Whereas the transgender community has 
made it clear that transgender individuals 
will not be erased and deserve to be accorded 
all of the rights and opportunities made 
available to all; 
Whereas, before the creation of the United 
States, Indigenous two-spirit, transgender, 
nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, and gen-
der-diverse individuals existed across North 
America in many Native American commu-
nities; 
Whereas many Native American commu-
nities have specific terms in their own lan-
guages for the gender-variant members of 
their communities and the social and spir-
itual roles these individuals fulfill; 
Whereas, while many two-spirit and gen-
der-variant traditions in Native American 
communities were lost or actively sup-
pressed by the efforts of missionaries, gov-
ernment agents, boarding schools, and set-
tlers, many of these traditions have seen a 
revival in recent decades; 
Whereas transgender, nonbinary, gender- 
nonconforming, and gender-diverse individ-
uals continue to bravely tell their stories 
and push for full equity under the law;

trict court in the District of Columbia. 
One of the two defendants in this case

with six counts: obstructing the count-
ing by Congress of the electoral ballots 
for President and Vice President; ob-

REMEMBERING JARED LLOYD 
HON. MONDAIRE JONES 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, March 23 
marks 1 year since the tragic passing of my 
constituent, Jared Lloyd, whose memory I 
wish to honor today. 
Mr. Lloyd was a volunteer firefighter with the 
Spring Valley Volunteer Fire Department in the 
village of Spring Valley, New York, where I 
grew up. On March 23 of last year, Jared 
Lloyd died a hero. He sacrificed his life to res-
cue residents of Evergreen Court Home for 
Adults from a horrific fire. 
Jared’s colleagues have said that he saved 
as many as 30 lives that day. I know that I 
speak on behalf of the people of Rockland 
County when I say that I cannot express how 
incredibly proud I am of him for his bravery 
and his selflessness, and how sad I am over 
his loss. 
Jared Lloyd was 35 years old. He was a 
son, a companion, and a loving father of two 
wonderful children, Logan and Darius. Jared 
was a schoolmate of mine. He was a graduate 
of Spring Valley High School. He had so much 
life left to live. He will never be forgotten. 
Today, he is remembered in the House of 
Representatives for his heroic actions.

MASON LARUSSO 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, l rise 
today to recognize and applaud Mason 
LaRusso for receiving the Adams County May-
ors and Commissioners Youth Award. 
Mason LaRusso is a 12th grader at Wash-
ington Square and Legacy High School and 
received this award because their determina-
tion and hard work have allowed them to over-
come adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Mason 
LaRusso is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Mason LaRusso for winning the Adams Coun-
ty Mayors and Commissioners Youth Award. I 
have no doubt they will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of their future ac-
complishments. 
HONORING ROBERT DARDANO 
HON. JOSEPH D. MORELLE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I want to 
pay tribute to one of Monroe County’s finest 
residents, Mr. Robert Dardano, Sr., who died 
at the age of 93 in February of this year. 
Mr. Dardano was well-known in the Roch-
ester community for his life-long commitment 
to working on behalf of our nation’s veterans. 
He was a veteran himself, having served our 
country in the U.S. Navy Seabees as well as 
the 58th CB Battalion in Okinawa, Japan dur-
ing WWII. He also served as a Naval reservist 
during the Korean War. 
At the conclusion of his active service, he 
devoted himself to serving the veterans of his 
community at the local, state, and national lev-
els as a member of a plethora of veterans or-
ganizations including the Italian-American War 
Veterans, the Veterans Memorial, and Execu-
tive Council for the City of Rochester, the Vet-
erans Advisory Committee of Monroe County, 
and among many others. 
Mr. Dardano also organized the annual 
placement of American flags on the graves of 
veterans in cemeteries throughout our commu-
nity, and he logged over 6,250 hours of com-
munity 
service 
at 
events 
for 
the 
local 
Canandaigua VA Medical Center. He and his 
wife Virginia also donated much of his paper-
work and photographs from his service with 
veterans’ organizations to the University of 
Rochester. 
I extend my deepest condolences to the 
Dardano family during this time. We here in 
Monroe County will never forget Robert’s self-
lessness and compassion, and I hope we as 
a community can do well to continue Robert’s 
devotion to selflessness and helping others.

Republican and Democratic Members of Con-
gress. They’re here to advocate for equitable 
federal resources to make sure that every tal-
ented student has access to world class 
science, technology, engineering, arts, and 
math education. 
We know that a well-prepared workforce— 
inclusive of America’s diverse communities—is 
necessary for cultivating our United States’ 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathe-
matics, or STEM, capacity. 
However, underrepresented minority stu-
dents are disproportionally left behind in their 
STEM studies. Researchers find over a third 
of Black and Latino students switch out of 
their STEM majors before earning their de-
gree, in part due to a lack of access to the 
academic resources that traditionally help sup-
port students to completion. 
This bill focuses on supporting those diverse 
STEM students into career success by sup-
porting institutions that predominantly serve 
minority students in their capacity to provide 
direct scholarships and comprehensive wrap-
around services, such as academic advising 
and tutoring, work-study, and undergraduate 
research opportunities. 
As the United States continues to support 
the cultivation of our STEM talent, we must 
help better provide the resources that help re-
tain, prepare, and promote the success of 
underrepresented and diverse students in 
STEM.

CARE IS AN ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 5547, the Care 
is an Economic Development Strategy Act or 
the CEDS Act, which requires grant applicants 
for certain public works and economic devel-
opment projects to describe how they will in-
crease the accessibility of affordable, quality, 
care-based services. 
These services include childcare, early 
childhood education, disability and long-term 
care, and elder care. 
This legislation increases the accessibility of 
affordable, quality, care-based services, and 
will expand quality childcare and support the 
dire needs of single parent homes. 
The CEDS Act will amend the Public Works 
and Economic Development Act of 1965, 
which provides grants for public works and de-
velopment facilities, and the planning and co-
ordination needed to alleviate conditions of 
substantial and persistent unemployment and 
underemployment in economically distressed 
areas and regions. 
By amending this law, this bill would require 
recipients of certain grants to develop a com-
prehensive economic development strategy 
that directly or indirectly increases the accessi-
bility of affordable, quality care-based serv-
ices, and for other purposes. 
The economic development strategy will en-
sure that all funds are being dispersed to pro-
grams that need them and will utilize the fund-
ing to provide quality care-based services.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E328 
March 31, 2022 
The COVID–19 pandemic has unveiled and 
emphasized how vital care-based access is to 
ensure that we have a functioning economy. 
According to the Family Caregiver Alliance, 
annually, about 8,357,100 people receive sup-
port from the 5 main long-term care services. 
These 
include: 
Home 
health 
agencies 
4,742,500; Nursing homes 1,383,700; Hos-
pices 1,244,500; Residential care communities 
713,300; Adult day service centers 273,200. 
The number of individuals using paid long- 
term care services in any setting will likely 
double from 13 million using services in 2000, 
to 27 million people by 2050. 
This estimate is impacted by steep growth 
in the population of older people who tend to 
need an increasing amount of care. 
Among the disabled and elder population in 
the world, about two-thirds rely solely on fam-
ily members to provide care, which often re-
sults in conflicts with their professional ca-
reers. 
These conflicts often limit their ability to 
work outside the home and provide for their 
families. 
For many parents, especially single moth-
ers, a lack of childcare reduces workforce par-
ticipation and prevents upward economic mo-
bility. 
Fifty-seven percent of working families spent 
more than $10,000 on childcare in 2020. 
Twenty-seven percent of families have dif-
ficulty accessing childcare because of high de-
mand and low supply of available childcare 
providers who have not yet reached capacity. 
On average, Americans with children spend 
at least 10 percent of their household income 
on childcare. 
Fifty-eight percent of working parents rely 
on childcare centers which equates to about 
6.38 million parents across the nation. 
This bill is a stepping stone towards eco-
nomic stability and allows hardworking Amer-
ican parents to return to their jobs. 
We must continue working alongside par-
ents, employers, and childcare advocates to 
secure an economy that helps working parents 
thrive. 
For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 5547.

HONORING THE COLLEGE OF SAN 
MATEO’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate the College of San Mateo on its 
100th Anniversary. The college, known to 
locals as CSM, is a shining star on the penin-
sula’s hillside, set high above the City of San 
Mateo and serving as a gateway to jobs or ad-
ditional higher education for tens of thousands 
each year. That includes me. I attended sum-
mer school one year on this beautiful campus. 
The numbers prove the college’s success. 
CSM offers 68 associate and transfer degree 
programs and an additional 81 professional 
and career certificates. Students at CSM regu-
larly transfer to San Francisco State, San Jose 
State and the University of California. CSM 
has contracts guaranteeing transfer with these 
universities, and more. 
The college started at a site in downtown 
San Mateo in 1922, the answer for a crisis in 
the affordability of higher education in America 
at that time. It seems like the same problem 
that we have today. For 100 years, it’s been 
the go-to place for students who needed a 
high-quality education but couldn’t afford Stan-
ford, Yale, Harvard or even the University of 
California. 
Since its birth, CSM has innovated. For ex-
ample, in recent years it began an innovative 
program known as Middle College, accepting 
high school students who take college-level 
classes while in high school. We talk a great 
deal about equal opportunity for all. After grad-
uating from high school, many students in this 
program matriculate to CSM or state colleges 
and the University of California having earned 
thousands of dollars of reduced-cost college 
credits while in high school. I view this pro-
gram as one of the most important offered by 
CSM because through affordable access to 
higher education our local students come one 
step closer to avoiding student debt while 
earning a valuable college degree. 
Even when students do not go to college 
during their high school years, the affordable 
classes at CSM are an enormous savings. A 
third of the college’s students are even eligible 
for a waiver of all fees. As one former CSM 
student put it, ‘‘Calculus is the same at the 
University of California as it is at CSM. It just 
costs thousands of dollars less.’’ This young 
man transferred from CSM to the University of 
California, Santa Cruz and graduated with a 
Bachelor’s in Computer Science. He estimated 
that he saved $60,000 and noted that he also 
had money in his college account—zero col-
lege debt—when he graduated from Santa 
Cruz. He enjoyed many of his CSM classes 
more than those at UC Santa Cruz and, at 
CSM, the professors even knew his name. 
So who are the dreamers of our current day 
who go to CSM? The college sends a mes-
sage that all are welcomed, and that it is com-
mitted to a campus culture that is antiracist 
and equity-advancing, where students and 
employees 
who 
are 
People 
of 
Color, 
Indiginous, LGBTQIA+, differently enabled, 
justice impacted, and undocumented are in-
cluded, embraced and celebrated for who they 
are. I also would be remiss if I didn’t mention 
that the CSM campus and adjacent land is the 
site of the district’s affordable housing devel-
opment for faculty and staff. Employee turn-
over has plummeted since this development 
was created, offering rents that are frequently 
50 percent or less of market rate. Other 
school districts in our county now plan to copy 
this strategy, and thus CSM, in so many dif-
ferent ways, teaches our community how to 
succeed. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to note 
that Dr. Jill Biden is right. Community college 
is the key to a great future for many Ameri-
cans. We should do more to reduce the costs 
of attending community colleges like CSM. 
They are not simply a community jewel on the 
hill. They are a vital tool to shape an American 
economy that offers hope and lifetime learning 
opportunities for every inquisitive student. 
Congratulations CSM. They are 100 years old, 
and still packing them in like they’re a youthful 
major league star on the playing field. Well, in 
fact, they are. 
COMMENDING AUSTAL ON THE 
LAUNCH OF NEW STEEL LINE 
HON. JERRY L. CARL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I commend 
Austal USA for the launch of their steel manu-
facturing line on April 12, 2022. This world- 
class steel expansion is not only a valuable 
asset for Mobile, but it is also vital for our na-
tional defense. Austal has invested $100 mil-
lion in the development of this venture, includ-
ing the necessary facility upgrades, new build-
ings, and state-of-the-art equipment. 
The addition of the steel line will create jobs 
both at Austal shipyard and throughout the 
steel line supply chain. Austal’s partnership 
with SSAB Americas to provide the steel in-
ventory for the Navy T-ATS program shows 
their commitment to utilizing regional re-
sources and labor. Austal is developing and 
growing the local workforce by hiring a mul-
titude of tradesmen and women to meet the 
demands of the new line. Additionally, they 
work with over 280 vendors in Alabama, in-
cluding many small businesses, who will 
greatly benefit from this new enterprise. 
Ensuring that Austal and the Gulf Coast can 
continue competing for future programs to 
meet the growing needs of the United States 
Navy and United States Coast Guard is in-
credibly important to our local economy, our 
state, and the defense interests of our entire 
nation. Austal USA is well equipped to meet 
these critical needs, and I’m proud of the work 
they do right here in Alabama’s First Congres-
sional District to keep our country safe and se-
cure.

FEMA CASEWORKER 
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 5343, the 
‘‘FEMA Caseworker Accountability Act.’’ 
This bill directs FEMA to report to Congress 
on case management personnel turnover. 
Specifically, FEMA must report on the turn-
over rate for their case management per-
sonnel, the average and median length of em-
ployment for such personnel, the steps that 
FEMA is taking or plans to take to lower the 
turnover rate, and other specified points. 
Madam Speaker, FEMA’s importance can-
not be overstated. They have invaluable abili-
ties to plan, coordinate, and execute very 
complex strategies to fulfill the disaster re-
sponse and mitigation needs of local and state 
governments through collaboration and co-
operation among a broad range of federal 
government agencies. 
Following the havoc inflicted by Hurricane 
Harvey, I experienced firsthand the power of 
FEMA’s skill, care, and rapid execution. 
The nine-county Houston metro area that 
was impacted by Hurricane Harvey covers 
9,444 square miles, an area larger than five 
states, including New Hampshire, New Jersey 
and Connecticut. 
Harris County covers 1,778 square miles, 
enough space to fit New York City, Philadel-
phia, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Austin and 
Dallas, with room still to spare. 
Over 41,500 square miles of land mass 
were impacted by Hurricane Harvey and the 
subsequent flooding that covered an area larg-
er than the States of Connecticut, Massachu-
setts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and 
Vermont combined. 
Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons 
of rainfall on Texas and Louisiana, most of it 
on the Houston Metroplex. 
Harvey dropped 51.88 inches of rain near 
Cedar Bayou, the highest total ever recorded 
for a single U.S. weather event. 
At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third 
of Houston was underwater. 
At the peak on August 31, there were 
34,575 evacuees in shelters across Texas. 
Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing dis-
aster to strike the U.S. in our nation’s history, 
damaging 203,000 homes, of which 12,700 
were destroyed. 
Months after Hurricane Harvey, in February 
2018, an estimated 10,098 families were still 
residing in hotel rooms, in over 1,500 hotels. 
Thousands of others whose homes were se-
verely damaged were living with family or 
friends. 
It was also the second costliest disaster 
ever recorded in the United States, with an es-
timated $125 billion dollars in damages. 
In its wake, 889,425 people registered for 
assistance with the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency. 
There were scores of families, including 
small children and the elderly, living in mold- 
infested or gutted-out homes. 
When this once-in-a-lifetime disaster struck 
my district, FEMA did their jobs exceedingly 
well, for which I am incredibly grateful. 
However, there is always room for improve-
ment in federal agencies, and FEMA is no ex-
ception. 
A high rate of caseworker turnover is the 
last thing that vulnerable families need. In my 
district, the recovery from Hurricane Harvey is 
ongoing, which can be seen in the caved-in 
roofs, torn-up streets; and shuttered buildings 
across my district. 
Those problems do not linger singularly be-
cause of caseworker turnover, but it is cer-
tainly a significant reason. If no one is working 
on closing these cases, or they are being 
managed by only a few overwhelmed individ-
uals, that’s a problem which needs fixing. 
Therefore, passing this legislation will set us 
on a path to fix that problem, Madam Speaker, 
which is why I strongly support this legislation 
and urge my colleagues to support it as well. 
H.R. 5343 will play a critical role in FEMA’s 
post-disaster response operations, and I look 
forward to reviewing Administrator Criswell’s 
future 
report 
and 
implementing 
its 
recommendations.

CONGRATULATING 
SHAQUILLE 
O’NEAL FOR WINNING AN OSCAR 
FOR ‘‘THE QUEEN OF BASKET-

HON. NIKEMA WILLIAMS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I want to congratulate my Fifth Congres-
sional District constituent, Olympian, four-time 
NBA Champion, NBA All-Star, and member of 
both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of 
Fame and FIBA Hall of Fame, Shaquille 
Rashaun O’Neal, on winning an Oscar. 
‘‘The Queen of Basketball,’’ produced by ex-
ecutive producers Shaquille O’Neal and Steph 
Curry, won the Academy Award for short sub-
ject documentary on March 27, 2022. 
The film shines a light on the incredible 
story of Lusia Harris, the first and only woman 
to be drafted by the NBA and the first to score 
a basket in women’s Olympic history. 
In addition to shattering glass ceilings her-
self, Harris helped lead her teams to excel-
lence, including winning three consecutive As-
sociation 
for 
Intercollegiate 
Athletics 
for 
Women National Championships and a silver 
medal at the 1976 Summer Olympic Games in 
Montreal. 
Harris, who recently passed away in Janu-
ary 2022, is a trailblazer in professional bas-
ketball and must be celebrated and com-
memorated for years to come. I thank you 
Shaquille O’Neal for doing just that. 
Congratulations to Shaq and the entire pro-
duction team on the award-winning ‘‘The 
Queen of Basketball.’’

TRIBUTE TO RENEE POWELL 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, as we 
continue our celebration of Women History 
Month, I rise today to pay tribute to a trail-
blazing woman, an extraordinary athlete, and 
a stalwart advocate. for equal rights. 
Renee Powell is being honored with the 
Charlie Bartlett Award by the Golf Writers As-
sociation on April 8, 2022, on the eve of the 
Masters golf tournament in August, Georgia. I 
echo their recognition of Renee for her lifelong 
contributions as a professional golfer and play-
er on the national and world stage. 
Renee Powell started life with a golf club in 
her hand, if not literally, at least figuratively. 
She was born in Camden, Ohio in 1946, the 
same year her father William Powell returned 
from World War II and was confronted with 
discrimination on and off the golf course. He 
worked nights as a security guard and spent 
his days building a golf course on farmland in 
East Canton, Ohio. He opened Clearview Golf 
Club, which he dubbed ‘‘America’s Course’’ in 
1948, where people of all colors were wel-
comed to play. He owned and operated the 
golf course for the remainder of his life.

March 31, 2022 
Renee began playing golf on her father’s 
course at the age of three and competed for 
the first time as a 12–year-old. Renee went on 
to play in college at both Ohio University and 
Ohio State. In 1967, she made her profes-
sional debut on the Ladies Professional Golf 
Association (LGPA) tour in the U.S. Women’s 
Open, becoming only the second African 
American woman to play on the LPGA tour. 
The first was South Carolina native, Althea 
Gibson, a tennis legend, who also played in 
the LPGA from 1963 to 1977. 
The two women faced death threats and 
were prohibited at times from staying in tour 
hotels or eating in local restaurants. They re-
ceived the support of the LPGA, whose mem-
bers decided they would not play in tour-
naments that discriminated against Black 
golfers. Renee went on to compete in more 
than 250 professional golf tournaments, finally 
retiring from the Tour in 1980. 
Following her retirement, Renee became a 
television commentator for ABC and CBS and 
travelled the world teaching the game ofgolf. 
In 1995, she returned home to Canton, Ohio, 
and assumed the role as head professional 
golfer at Clearview Golf Course, which she 
manages today with her brother,. Larry Powell. 
Under their leadership, and a little help from 
some congressional friends, the course was 
added to the National Register of Historic 
Places in 2001. 
That same year, the Powell family estab-
lished the Clearview. Legacy Foundation for 
Education, Preservation, and Turf Grass Re-
search. In 2011, Renee launched Clearview 
H.O.P.E., which serves female veterans. The 
program provides free recreational and thera-
peutic activities for former servicemembers, 
many of whom suffer from post-traumatic 
stress disorder. 
Renee has received numerous honors in-
cluding the Professional Golfers’ Association’s 
First Lady of Golf Award in 2003, and she was 
the first recipient of the Rolex ‘‘For the Love 
of the Game’’ Award in 2007. She has been 
awarded honorary membership in the Royal 
and Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews, Scot-
land, known as ‘‘the home of golf.’’ She has 
received an honorary doctorate from the Uni-
versity of St. Andrews and a dormitory on the 
campus is named in her honor. In 2019, 
Renee was elected the first at-large member 
of the PGA of America board of directors. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating Renee Pow-
ell’s contributions to the game of golf and her 
courage to make the sport more accessible 
and affordable for all people. Her life serves 
as an example to many young minority golfers 
today to follow their dreams and fight to over-
come any barriers they may encounter.

OF 
HAMBURG 
VIL-
LAGE MAYOR THOMAS J. MOSES, 
SR. 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in recognition of Hamburg Village 
Mayor Thomas J. Moses, Sr. in honor of his 
retirement and decades of service to his com-
munity. It’s been an honor to represent the Vil-
lage of Hamburg for a decade now, as Erie 
County Clerk, the New York State Senate, and 
now in Congress. All that time having the 
great honor to work with and get to know this 
truly good man and model public servant. 
Mayor Moses was born on April 1, 1947 and 
began serving the Village of Hamburg at the 
age of 11, when he volunteered at the play-
ground. He graduated from Saints Peter & 
Paul and Hamburg High School in 1966, then 
attended Erie Community College. He was 
later hired by the Village and went on to serve 
as Recreation Supervisor for 32 years. 
Mayor Moses has worked to improve the 
lives of village residents by developing and im-
proving Hamburg’s parks and playgrounds, as 
well as by overseeing renovations to village 
assets like the Village Swim Center. 
Mayor Moses has always believed in vol-
unteerism and community service. He was 
one of the founders of the Hamburg High 
School EMT program and is a member and 
past president of the Hamburg Volunteer Fire 
Department. He also served as Assistant Vil-
lage Disaster Coordinator. Mayor Moses has 
served on numerous committees and boards, 
all with a focus on improving the aesthetics, 
services, opportunities, and educational offer-
ings in the Village. 
During his 16 years of service as Hamburg 
Village Mayor, Mayor Moses oversaw the 
transformation of the Village of Hamburg with 
the Route 62 project that has drawn recogni-
tion from across the country. He has worked 
tirelessly to make the community he calls 
home a special place to live, and his leader-
ship has made a significant impact on the Vil-
lage of Hamburg. 
Mayor Moses has been married to his wife, 
Mary Lou Leyda, for 54 years. They have two 
sons, Tom Jr., and Tim, 6 grandkids, and 3 
great-grandkids. 
Mayor Moses represents the very idea of 
public service and passion for his community 
is unmatched. Madam Speaker, please join 
me in congratulating Mayor Moses on his re-

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
MONICA GAYLE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Monica Gayle on the occa-
sion of her retirement from FOX 2 Detroit after 
twenty-five years. Her significant contributions 
to our Metro Detroit community are worthy of 
commendation. 
A Washington State native, Ms. Gayle grad-
uated from the University of Washington with 
a degree in Communications in 1982. She 
began her career in local news at home in 
Washington and then joined CBS in New 
York. She joined the main news anchor team 
at WJBK–TV in 1997. Along with her co-an-
chor, Huel Perkins, she is a part of one of the 
longest running anchor teams in Metro Detroit 
and has spent the last twenty-five years keep-
ing the people of Southeastern Michigan in-
formed on the issues of the day. Together 
they’ve covered the stories that define us—9/ 
11, the inauguration of President Obama, 
Kwame Kilpatrick, and the implosion of the 
Hudson Building in Downtown Detroit. 
Described by her co-anchor Huel as com-
passionate and brilliant, full of love and kind-
ness Ms. Gayle has been a familiar face be-
hind the news desk for a quarter of a century. 
She is a five-time Regional Emmy Award win-
ning journalist and has anchored for a number 
of top-rated television markets throughout her 
over four decades-long career. Her work has 
taken her overseas to cover important stories 
in England, Ireland, Russia, Bosnia, and Hon-
duras. A mother herself, she has always had 
a passion for covering the issues that matter 
to women and families and in 2006 she re-
ceived the Operation Smile ‘‘Humanitarian of 
The Year’’ award. Ms. Gayle continues to re-
side in Michigan with her husband Dean and 
son Tanner. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Monica Gayle for an ex-
emplary career at FOX 2 Detroit. I join with 
Ms. Gayle’s family, friends, and colleagues in 
extending my gratitude to her for her tireless 
commitment to our community and to thank 
her for her role in keeping the people of Michi-
gan informed for over two decades. Though 
we will miss her skilled reporting and seeing 
the familiar faces of Monica and co-anchor 
Huel on FOX 2, we wish her the very best in 
retirement.

protect transportation personnel and pas-
sengers from sexual assault and harassment. 
The bill would require certain passenger 
transportation carriers, including passenger 
airlines, buses, passenger railroads, and 
transportation network companies (Uber or 
Lyft) to establish formal policies, trainings, and 
reporting structures to crack down on sexual 
assault and harassment. 
The bill would also institute penalties for in-
dividuals who physically or sexually assault or 
threaten transportation personnel. 
Public transportation is essential to the lives 
of millions of Americans. The threat of being 
sexually assaulted or harassed obstructs their 
ability to get to work, school or to pick up their 
kids from day care. 
Passengers of public transportation live with 
a constant fear of being sexually victimized or 
threatened. Women especially have a higher 
chance of experiencing these sorts of encoun-
ters. 
In Houston there have been several cases 
of men and women both passengers and em-
ployees of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, 
that have faced harassment and assault on 
public transport. 
Public transportation should be the last 
place where Americans fear for their lives. 
We must use our authority as Members of 
Congress to put in place a system that would 
help protect passengers from these obscene 
crimes, This bill would help protect the single 
mom in Houston trying to get to work on time, 
or the middle schooler in New York City using 
the subway to get to school. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 5706 the Stop Sexual Assault 
and Harassment in Transportation Act.

CAROL

FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO EN-

HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in congratulating former 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Ad-
ministrator Carol Browner, who is this year’s 
recipient of the Pure Earth Force of Nature 
Award. 
A lifelong environmental advocate, Adminis-
trator Browner spearheaded the creation of 
the EPA’s first policy that focused on the link 
between children’s health risks and exposure 
to environmental hazards, resulting in the es-
tablishment of the EPA’s Office of Children’s 
Health Protection (OCHP). Today, the OCHP 
remains vigilant in its work to increase envi-
ronmental health literacy among health care 
providers, in addition to evaluating and raising 
awareness about environmental contaminants 
that may contribute to childhood disease. 
Administrator Browner holds the title of the 
longest serving EPA Administrator in the 
agency’s history, and under her leadership, 
much was accomplished. She continues to 
work to combat environmental risks to chil-
dren’s health through a public-private partner-
ship that is tackling the global lead poisoning 
crisis, which impacts 800 million children in 
low- and middle-income countries.

TRIBUTE TO RICHARD THEODORE 
GREENER, THE FIRST AFRICAN 
AMERICAN TO GRADUATE FROM 
HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, Academician, Attorney, business-
man, Civic leader and accomplished Amer-
ican, Mr. Richard Theodore Greener, the first 
African American to graduate from Harvard 
University. Richard Greener was born in Phila-
delphia, Pennsylvania on January 30, 1844. 
He quit school in his mid-teens to earn money 
for his family, but one of his employers helped 
him enroll in a preparatory school at Oberlin 
College. He graduated from Phillips Academy 
in 1865, and he spent three years at Oberlin 
College before transferring to Harvard College. 
His admission to Harvard was an experiment 
by the administration and paved the way for 
more Black students to attend Harvard. 
Richard Theodore Greener graduated from 
Harvard College in 1870. In 1875, Richard 
Greener became the first African American to 
be elected as a member of the American Phil-
ological Association. He graduated from law 
school at South Carolina university, and prac-
ticed law in South Carolina, then Washington, 
D.C. before joining the Howard University Law 
School as a professor, and eventually a dean. 
In 1875, Richard Greener was chosen by 
the General Assembly of South Carolina to be 
a member of a commission to revise the 
South Carolina School system. In 1880, he 
became a law clerk of the first comptroller of 
the United States Treasury; from 1876 to 1879 
he represented South Carolina in the Union 
League of America and was President of the 
South Carolina Republican Association in 
1887. From 1885 to 1892, he served as Sec-
retary of the Grant Association, where he is 
credited with having led the eventual fund-
raising effort which brought in donations from 
90,000 people worldwide to construct Grant’s 
Tomb, still the largest mausoleum in North 
America. From 1885 to 1890, he was Chief 
Examiner of the Civic Service Board for New 
York City and County; and in the 1896 elec-
tion, he served as the Head of the Colored 
Bureau of the National Republican Party in 
Chicago. In 1875, he was appointed as the 
United States Commercial Agent in Vladi-
vostok, Russia, and stayed in the foreign serv-
ice until 1905. 
Richard Greener was well recognized for his 
work. While at Harvard in 1868 and 1870, he 
earned the Bowdoin Prize. He received two 
honorary Doctor of Laws degrees, one from 
Monrovia College in Liberia in 1882 and the 
second one from Howard University in 1907. 
In 1902, the Chinese government decorated 
him with the order of the Double Dragon. Phil-
lips Academy has the Richard T. Greener 
1865 Endowed Scholarship. The University of 
South Carolina’s Black Alumni Council Spon-
sors the Richard T. Greener Endowment 
Fund, the Central Quadrangle at Phillips Acad-
emy was named in his honor in 2018, and the 
University of South Carolina is honoring his 
legacy by erecting a statue on campus. 
Richard T. Greener eventually settled in 
Chicago where he worked for an insurance 
company, practiced law and lectured about his 
life and times. 
Much of this information came from Mr. 
Greener’s Harvard diploma and personal pa-
pers discovered in an attic in Chicago. 
What a great man, what a great history, 
what a great American.

DAEVION TURNER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO

Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Daevion Tur-
ner for receiving the Adams County Mayors 
and Commissioners Youth Award. 
Daevion Turner is an 11th grader at Van-
tage Point High School and received this 
award because their determination and hard 
work have allowed them to overcome adversi-
ties. 
The dedication demonstrated by Daevion 
Turner is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Daevion Turner for winning the Adams County 
Mayors and Commissioners Youth Award. I 
have no doubt they will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of their future ac-
complishments.

Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize an outstanding member of my staff, 
Senior Legislative Assistant Jay Campbell, as 
he prepares to leave my office and Capitol Hill 
to pursue a new career path. 
Jay is one of the most genuine and loyal 
people I have met during my time in Wash-
ington. Through his hard work, dedication, and 
his passion for identifying legislative solutions, 
Jay embodies what it means to be a public 
servant. 
Amongst his colleagues Jay is respected as 
a knowledgeable and effective Transportation 
and Infrastructure policy wonk. I could not 
have asked for a better Transportation and In-
frastructure advisor for my first year in Con-
gress. I will certainly miss his intellectual in-
sight to help solve the problems facing the 
people of TX–22.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF DR. OLIVIA LEOLA TORRES 
CRUZ 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Olivia 
Leola Torres Cruz. Dr. Cruz was an esteemed 
leader, selfless advocate, and dedicated serv-
ant to the People of Guam. Our people will 
fondly remember her as a trailblazing force 
that meaningfully contributed to shaping our 
island’s healthcare sector and improving the 
lives of countless others throughout our island. 
Widely recognized for her historic achieve-
ment as Guam’s first female CHamoru physi-
cian, Dr. Cruz navigated a path unpaved with 
unwavering courage and determination. As a 
young girl that had endured World War II, her 
education was interrupted. Yet upon its con-
clusion she remained steadfast in her resolve 
to excel in school, consistently passing bi-an-
nual examinations to elevate her grade level. 
After graduating from George Washington 
High School as one of its Top Ten scholars in 
1953, Dr. Cruz moved thousands of miles 
away from home to pursue an undergraduate 
career at the University of Wisconsin. She 
then continued with graduate level research 
and courses in chemistry at the University of 
Cincinnati and, in 1962, graduated from the 
Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania. 
Shortly after medical school, Dr. Cruz went on 
to complete an internship at the Denver Gen-
eral Hospital in addition to residencies for in-
ternal and pulmonary medicine at the Denver 
General Hospital, Herman Houston Hospital, 
and Allegheny General Hospital respectively. 
Though Dr. Cruz pursued her professional 
education in the continental United States, she 
kept her people at the forefront of her mind 
and proudly held her identity as a daughter of 
Guam close to her heart. In 1967 she returned 
home impassioned with a mission to increase 
our community’s access to medical care. From 
serving at the Guam Department of Public 
Health and Guam Memorial Hospital (GMH) to 
collaborating with the National Institute of 
Health Research Station as a consultant on 
lytico-bodig research, a neurodegenerative 
disease endemic to the CHamoru people, Dr. 
Cruz devoted her expertise, talents, and dec-
ades of work toward standing up a system of 
care that holistically addresses the needs of 
our island. This commitment to community is 
further demonstrated in her persistence to 
serve as many people as possible by opening 
her very own private practice clinic, wherein 
she often provided care to those who could 
least afford it, and continuing to work part time 
at GMH despite having retired from govern-
ment service in 1998. 
Beyond her professional capacities, Dr. 
Cruz embodied a strong sense of character, 
unquestioningly prioritizing others before self— 
a notable example of which was illustrated by 
her heroic actions to save three individuals 
who had been involved in an incident in which 
a twenty-ton compactor toppled over a two- 
hundred-foot cliff. Without hesitation, Dr. Cruz 
climbed twenty-five feet down the face of the 
cliff to render first aid to the injured operator 
and had them hoisted up to the surface first. 
Her personal undertaking to lead with compas-
sion is both evident over the course of her life-
time and serves an inspiring blueprint for the 
many women today who similarly endeavor to 
pursue a career in medicine. 
Dr. Olivia Leola Torres Cruz is an icon of 
servant leadership and unconditional compas-
sion who poured her heart into securing a bet-
ter health future for our people. As Women’s 
History Month and Mes CHamoru come to a 
close, it is further fitting that we reflect on the 
meaningful contributions of leaders like Dr. 
Cruz, whose life and legacy have and con-
tinue to impact the story of our island commu-
nity. We extend our deepest condolences to 
her husband, Dr. Robert Haddock, their chil-
dren, Michele and Ray, their grandchildren, 
Robert, Olivia, Francisco, Carlos, Gregorio, 
Stephen, and Jose, and the rest of their family 
and friends, and join the People of Guam in 
remembering and celebrating her life and leg-
acy of selfless service. Dr. Cruz will be deeply 
missed, and her love and memories will for-
ever remain in the hearts of the People of 
Guam.

REMEMBERING BRENT RENAUD 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize 
award-winning 
journalist 
Brent 
Renaud, who was killed in Ukraine at the 
hands of Russian soldiers. 
Brent was a Little Rock native who traveled 
around the world to share the stories and lift 
the voices of individuals who otherwise may 
not have been heard. 
At the time of his tragic death, Brent was in 
Ukraine, covering the current refugee crisis 
that has developed because of Russia’s un-
warranted and illegal invasion of the sovereign 
nation of Ukraine. 
Brent made a difference in the Arkansas 
arts community as co-founder of the Little 
Rock Film Festival and serving as a mentor 
within the community. 
My prayers are with Brent, his family, his 
friends, and all that were blessed to know him.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDGAR 
WINFIELD BARCLIFF, JR. 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to Edgar Winfield Barcliff, Jr. after 
his passing on March 16, 2022. Edgar was a 
beloved husband and family man as well as a 
proud son of Newark, NJ. 
Born in Newark in 1944, Edgar knew that 
helping his community and those most in need 
would be his life’s work. He started off as a 
young cadet in the 1960s before he passed 
the examination to become an Essex County 
Correction Officer in 1970. He would serve a 
long and accomplished career at the Essex 
County Jail in Newark. In 1986, he became 
the first Correction Officer in Essex County to 
receive the Officer of the Year Award. Later, 
Edgar was the first Correction Officer from the 
State of New Jersey to be recognized as one 
of the top five Correction Officers in the coun-
try. 
Edgar continued his exemplary record of 
service when he completed a training course 
for investigators at the Criminal Justice Acad-
emy’s New Jersey Division. After that, he was 
appointed as an Investigator at the Internal Af-
fairs Bureau. In 1996, Edgar was promoted to 
Sergeant and became a Supervisor in the In-
ternal Affairs Division of the same jail where 
he began his career. He was active in New-
ark’s West Ward Civic Organization and re-
ceived numerous awards and commendations 
from federal, state, county, and municipal 
agencies for his contributions. 
After more than 31 years of service, Edgar 
retired in 2002. But he continued his service 
with several local and national law enforce-
ment organizations. He was a member of the 
Board of Trustees for the New Jersey Chapter 
of the National Organization of Black Law En-
forcement Executives (NOBLE) and the Na-
tional Director and Vice Chairman of the Cor-
rectional Peace Officers Foundation (CPOF). 
He was committed to supporting officers and 
their families as they navigated through the 
very demanding law enforcement profession. 
Edgar’s law enforcement and volunteer work 
were both personal and professional for him. 
He was a fierce protector of his family, neigh-
bors, and friends and a true advocate for 
safer, more just neighborhoods and commu-
nity service. His legacy will live on through the 
people he touched—from the officers he 
mentored to the people in Newark and sur-
rounding communities that he served to the 
family he loved. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in celebrating his life of 
public service and extend my deepest condo-
lences to his spouse, children, grandchildren, 
great-grandchild, cousins, nieces and neph-
ews, and friends.

Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the plaza dedication in 
honor of Jose ‘‘Joe’’ Campos Torres taking 
place Saturday, April 2, 2022. 
On May 5, 1977, Army veteran Joe Campos 
Torres died of injuries inflicted by several on- 
duty officers of the Houston Police Department 
(HPD). Following a cruel, racially-motivated 
beating that evening, the police officers took 
him to the city jail where the jail staff refused 
to process Joe due to his grave visible inju-
ries. Officers were instructed to transport him 
to the hospital for medical care. Outrageously, 
the officers instead pushed Joe off a wharf 
into the Buffalo Bayou. Tragically, he did not 
survive.

Joe Campos Torres was taken from his 
family and our community too soon, but his 
legacy was the light shone on violent police in-
cidents plaguing Latinos and minorities in 
1977. This set a new course of police reform 
for HPD. In 2021, Houston Police Chief Troy 
Finner issued a public apology for the brutal 
murder at the hands of HPD officers more 
than 40 years ago. Following sincere attempts 
to address racism within their ranks, today, 
HPD reflects the diversity of the city and is 
committed to building powerful relationships 
with 
minority 
communities. 
Joe 
Campos 
Torres’ sacrifice sparked this movement and 
continues to protect countless numbers of 
Latino and minority community members. 
Madam Speaker, let the record show Jose

RECOGNIZING THE VIETNAM ERA 
VETERANS 
HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pride that I rise today to commemorate 
Vietnam veteran alumni from Bel Air High 
School who made the ultimate sacrifice in 
service to our country. 
On March 29, 2022, we commemorate the 
49th anniversary of the last United States 
combat units leaving South Vietnam. Every 
year on this day, we observe National Vietnam 
War Veterans Day to honor the service that 
veterans made and gain a deeper under-
standing of their sacrifice. Additionally, the 
Junior 
Reserve 
Officer’s 
Training 
Corps 
(JROTC) students and staff at Bel Air High 
School spend countless hours learning about 
the war and work to find ways to honor the 
Vietnam veterans. 
I would like to recognize the Bel Air Vietnam 
veteran alumni who gave their life in honor of 
their service. The veterans who paid the ulti-
mate sacrifice are: 
CPL Charles Peter Barnes, CPL Luis Carlos 
Borrego, 
SP4 
Roberto 
Dominguez, 
SGT 
Bobby W. Jobe, SP4 Fred V. Jurado, PFC 
Daniel Leon Navarro, PFC James Wayne 
Parham, SPC4 Thomas Edward Ross, CPL 
Hugo H. Ulloa, CPT. James Robert Valtr. 
Our Vietnam veterans fought bravely for our 
country, and we are eternally grateful. Upon 
their return home, they continued their service 
in other capacities by continuing their military 
careers or reentering the workforce. Because 
of these veterans, America is a stronger na-
tion for generations to come. I am also hum-
bled to recognize the Bel Air High School 
JROTC cadets in their work to memorialize 
Vietnam veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
recognizing our Vietnam veterans everywhere. 
We are forever grateful for their service. 
DON YOUNG COAST GUARD 
AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Ms JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 6865 the Don Young Coast 
Guard Authorization Act to authorize appro-
priations for the Coast Guard. 
For the last 230 years, the Coast Guard has 
played a vital role in protecting the marine en-
vironment, guarding our nations extensive 
coastline, and has performed crucial life sav-
ing missions. 
Over the years, I have had the opportunity 
to see the Coast Guard in action leading up to 
and following hurricanes like Ike and Harvey 
that impacted the Houston area. 
I convey thanks and appreciation from 
Houstonians to the members of the Coast 
Guard for their service to our great Nation. 
The history of the United States Coast 
Guard can be traced to the United States Rev-
enue Cutter Service, which was founded on 
August 4, 1790, as part of the Department of 
the Treasury. 
The Coast Guard has protected the United 
States throughout its long history and served 
proudly in every one of the Nation’s conflicts. 
The Coast Guard served as the nation’s 
only armed force on the sea until Congress 
launched the Navy Department in 1798. 
On January 28, 1915, the Revenue Cutter 
Service and the United States Life-Saving 
Service were merged to become the Coast 
Guard. 
The U.S. Coast Guard conducts operations 
that ensure the safety of our nation’s water-
ways and provides humanitarian assistance 
during national disasters. 
The Coast Guard conducted critical search 
and rescue missions in response to Hurricane 
Harvey, which devasted my home district in 
Houston, Texas. 
The Coast Guard’s response included 2,600 
active duty, reserve, civil servant, and auxiliary 
personnel: 50 rotary and fixed-wing aircraft, 75 
shallow-water boats, and 29 coast guard cut-
ters. 
The efforts from the Coast Guard resulted in 
the rescue of over 11,000 people along the 
Texas and Louisiana cost during and after 
Hurricane Harvey. 
During and in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Harvey 51 members of the Coast Guard suf-
fered catastrophic property loss and 124 oth-
ers reported property damage in the impacted 
areas of Texas during Harvey. 
This authorization will ensure that our coun-
try’s devoted naval personnel have the means 
to effectively protect and defend our borders 
as well as expand our sea and land capabili-
ties. 
Authorizing funding for the Coast Guard is 
essential to sustaining our place in the inter-
national system as the world’s most powerful 
naval force. 
Donald Edwin Young was a dear colleague 
of mine. For the past 49 years, he represented 
Alaska’s at-large congressional district and 
made a significant impact on his constituency, 
I urge all my colleagues to support the Don 
Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022.

matic and cultural ties with the stalwart island 
nation since. This diplomatic support has ex-
pressed itself through the work of organiza-
tions like USAID and direct commercial links 
between our nations for six decades. And in 
the last year alone, the United States has 
demonstrated its strong support for Jamaica 
through its fight against COVID–19. The 
United States has sent hundreds of thousands 
of COVID–19 vaccines to Jamaica to combat 
the pandemic, and as of December 2021 we 
have shipped over 400,000 vaccines to the is-
land. But the effects of this crisis expand be-
yond public health; Jamaica has relied heavily 
on tourism for its economic successes, and 
the COVID–19 pandemic hit the nation ex-
traordinarily hard. 
To help alleviate those pains, Vice President 
HARRIS met Prime Minister Andrew Holness at 
the White House this week. There she an-
nounced $30 million in economic assistance to 
further augment Jamaica’s economic recovery 
from the pandemic, including investments in 
human capital and violence reduction. These 
essential investments were capped by the an-
nouncement of even more investments to help 
Jamaica survive a rapidly changing Caribbean 
climate, as evidenced by the ever-stronger 
storm systems and hurricanes that ravage the 
region every year. 
The United States and Jamaica also co-
operate proactively on Caribbean security. 
Under the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, 
the United States provides Jamaica with sup-
port in tackling trafficking, including training, 
equipment, and technical assistance on mari-
time security procedures and more. Our coop-
erative efforts help to counter public corruption 
and enhances the Jamaican justice system’s 
efforts to fight crime across the country. 
But good relations between our nations 
goes beyond diplomatic ties, as Jamaicans 
have emigrated in droves over the decades to 
the United States. In New York City we are 
able to enjoy such cultural staples such as Ja-
maican jerk chicken and ox tails, live Reggae 
music and more as a result of our neighbor’s 
cultural heritage. Even the highest levels of 
government enjoy cultural links to Jamaica, 
where the father of our Vice President was 
born. 
Congratulations to Jamaica for six decades 
of independent governance, and for being 
such a longstanding and firm partner of the 
United States.

HONORING THE LIFE AND CON-
TRIBUTIONS OF A FIERCE EDU-
CATION ADVOCATE, DR. WALTER 
LEE SMITH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of the life and contributions 
of Dr. Walter Lee Smith, seventh president of 
Florida A&M University (FAMU) and out-
standing citizen of Tampa and Hillsborough 
County, who passed away on Thursday, No-
vember 25, 2021 at the age of 86. A scholar, 
historian, advocate and educational leader, Dr. 
Smith was a native of Tampa, Florida, but the 
impact of his great work reached far beyond 
our community, having touched the lives of 
those across Florida, our nation and the world. 
Dr. Walter Lee Smith was born in Tampa, 
Florida on May 13, 1935, to the late Eva 
Smith (Reynolds). Raised by his mother and 
stepfather, Rubin Reynolds, a strong work 
ethic was instilled in Smith from a very young 
age and applied throughout his childhood 
raised in Florida, Georgia and New York. He 
excelled both academically and in sports, all 
while living through firsthand experiences of 
racism and segregation within his commu-
nities. Smith’s perseverance during these in-
stances not only showed signs of his strong 
character but would go on to influence his pro-
fessional interests and achievements. Years 
down the line, Smith would go on to work for 
the federal government and help to develop 
Titles IV and VI programs for school desegre-
gation. 
As a young adult, Dr. Walter Lee Smith 
worked pushing clothing racks in the New 
York Garment district before he went on to en-
list in the U.S. Army, having served his nation 
during the Korean war. Following his military 
service, Smith returned to Tampa Bay where 
he enrolled at Gibbs Junior College, the first of 
Florida’s junior colleges for African American 
students. Smith was elected as the first stu-
dent body president during his time at Gibbs. 
Following this, he went on to attend Florida 
A&M University and earned a Bachelor’s De-
gree in Biology and Chemistry and subse-
quently a Masters of Education. Smith com-
pleted his education by earning a Doctorate in 
Higher Education Administration from The 
Florida State University. 
Before becoming FAMU’s seventh presi-
dent, Smith worked in various roles throughout 
Tampa as: a 7-Eleven Store manager in 
Progress Village, a science teacher at Mar-
shall High School in Plant City, assistant direc-
tor of the Florida Education Association and 
provost at Hillsborough Community College. 
From 1974 to 1977, he served as president of 
Roxbury Community College in Boston, Mas-
sachusetts. 
Smith was appointed the seventh president 
of FAMU in 1977, serving in this role until 
1985. Under his leadership, FAMU as an edu-
cational institution was positively impacted in 
innumerable ways. The university grew to 
eleven schools and colleges. Among those 
added were the School of Allied Health 
Science, School of General Studies, the 
School of Journalism & Graphic Communica-
tion, the FAMU–FSU College of Engineering 
and a Division of Graduate Studies and Con-
tinuing Education. Various Graduate and Doc-
torate 
programs 
were 
established 
under 
Smith’s administration, with the university hav-
ing offered its first Doctor of Philosophy de-
gree, a Ph.D. in Pharmacology, in 1984. Be-
yond academics, FAMU’s athletic department 
was greatly developed during Smith’s tenure 
and a $10-million Centennial Celebration Fund 
endowment was established, having since 
grown to more than $150 million. 
But Dr. Smith’s educational efforts did not 
stop there. Following his departure from 
FAMU, Smith was appointed as a senior Ful-
bright Scholar and worked abroad with the 
University of Malawi. In 1994 through 1995, he 
founded FUNDA, an American style two-year 
college, specifically in Malawi and South Afri-
ca. After his time abroad, Smith worked as a 
professor at the University of Florida until his 
retirement in 2000. In 2002, he opened a pri-
vately held community library in his hometown 
of Tampa. 
Dr. Smith is survived by his wife, Barbara 
Abrams Smith; children: Col. John L. Smith 
(ret.), Andre Smith, Salesia Smith-Gordon, 
Walter Lee Smith II, Tracey Abrams Butler; 
grandchildren, great-grandchildren and other 
members of their extended family. 
Along with his family, Smith’s lifelong com-
mitment to education will be carried on in a 
legacy across the various institutions he 
worked with. In 2007, FAMU named its School 
of Architecture and Engineering Technology 
building in honor of Dr. Smith. At the Univer-
sity of Florida, colleagues and former students 
of Smith’s funded the creation of the Walter L. 
Smith Scholarship to support minority grad-
uate students in educational administration. 
The Florida State University also holds a 
scholarship in Dr. Smith’s name and in 2015, 
Hillsborough County Libraries named a read-
ing room at the Robert Saunders Library in his 
honor as well. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of 
Florida and my neighbors across Tampa Bay, 
I am proud to honor Dr. Walter Lee Smith and 
his selfless devotion of strengthening edu-
cation institutions and expanding their accessi-
bility in Tampa, Florida, the United States and 
beyond. Dr. Smith’s legacy is cemented into 
the history of our community and will live on 
and inspire others for many years to come.

HONORING SCOTT BUSBOOM’S 
RETIREMENT 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Scott 
Busboom of Decatur, Illinois. 
Scott has worked in the radio industry for 
more than 30 years. Most recently, he has 
spent over 20 plus years broadcasting in De-
catur. He spent the past 10 years waking up 
Decatur with the ‘‘Busboom and Wolfe’’ morn-
ing show, which he hosted with long-time tele-
vision reporter and friend, Doug Wolfe. 
Scott was an avid fan and supporter of local 
high school and college athletics. He has 
broadcast more than 350 boys’ and girls’ high 
school basketball games and more than 325 
Millikin University men’s and women’s games. 
He broadcast the first Decatur High School 
girls’ game on the radio and was at the micro-
phone for the Millikin women’s 2005 NCAA Di-
vision III National Championship victory. 
Scott helped form the Decatur Thanksgiving 
Tournament and was inducted into the Illinois 
Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame 
in 2013. 
As a monthly guest on ‘‘Busboom and 
Wolfe’’ for many years, I will miss our con-
versations and his presence on Talk 101 FM. 
I want to congratulate Scott on a long and ac-
complished career, and I wish him a restful re-
tirement. He truly deserves it.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF LYNN MARIE HAMSTRA 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and commemorate the life and serv-
ice of Lynn Marie Hamstra. Lynn, with great 
courage and vigor, lived a full life of loving 
service to her family and her community. After 
four and a half years of fighting a fierce battle 
against an aggressive form of pancreatic can-
cer, Lynn peacefully passed into the arms of 
the Lord on March 26, 2022, surrounded by 
her loved ones. Lynn is survived by her hus-
band, Daniel Hamstra; her daughter, Rachel 
Hamstra LeMier; her son-in-law, Ryan LeMier; 
her granddaughter, Olivia Lynn LeMier; her 
sons, 
Timothy 
Hamstra 
and 
Zachariah 
Hamstra; her mother, Adeline Coffey; her sis-
ters, Laura (Coffey) Girgis and Lee Ellen 
(Coffey) Wilson; and her brothers, Larry and 
Tony Coffey. 
Lynn was born in Chicago on April 19, 1961 
to Lawrence Raymond Coffey, Jr., and Adeline 
Frances Coffey. She was the oldest of five 
children and excelled in her role as the big 
sister. During her high school years at 
Hinsdale Central, Lynn was a world class

cheerleader who not only found the time to 
cheer at her brother’s games but also coach 
her sisters in cheer. After graduating from high 
school, she went on to attend Purdue Univer-
sity where she studied electrical engineering. 
During her collegiate years she met the love 
of her life Daniel Lee Hamstra who played 
baseball with her brother Larry at the Univer-
sity of Illinois. On the same night of their first 
meeting Dan pitched a no-hitter, the only one 
of his baseball career. Needless to say, it was 
a match made in heaven and just a few years 
later Dan and Lynn were married on July 26, 
1986. 
Lynn and Dan thrived together, and their 
marriage was a model of fidelity, love, and de-
votion to all they encountered. Even in the 
midst of their busy lives Lynn and Dan man-
aged, for over ten years, to make it to ball-
room dancing classes. During the course of 
their thirty-five years of marriage Lynn and 
Dan had three beautiful children: Rachel Marie 
Hamstra, Timothy Lee Hamstra, and Zacha-
riah Andrew Hamstra. Each of Lynn’s children 
are uniquely gifted and had their own precious 
relationship with their mom. Each of the kids 
have a little bit of their mother that they will 
carry on. From her boisterous laugh and keen 
intuition to her strong convictions and creative 
streak. 
Lynn continued her education later in life 
and obtained a Master of Liberal Studies with 
a concentration in Art History from the South-
ern Methodist University in 2017. One of the 
proudest accomplishments of her life was her 
development of the ‘‘Focused Looking’’ pro-
gram which was designed to help doctors to 
increase observation skills by taking a deeper 
look at a single piece of art for one hour. 
Lynn’s graduate work was influential in both 
the art and medical fields. She leaves behind 
a legacy from this work that has blessed many 
patients and doctors alike. 
There is no doubt in my mind that this very 
special woman will be dearly missed. She 
lived a life full of joy in her marriage, her 
motherhood, 
professional 
and 
academic 
spheres. Lynn’s husband, children, and family 
will carry all of her exemplary virtues as a little 
piece of Lynn lives on in each of their hearts. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capital to recognize 
Lynn Hamstra’s well-lived and beautiful life. 
Furthermore, Madam Speaker, I extend my 
personal condolences to the Hamstra family 
for the loss of such an extraordinarily brave 
and loving woman. May God rest the soul of 
this great American.

HONORING 
EARL 
G. 
GRAVES, 
FOUNDER 
OF 
BLACK 
ENTER-
PRISE MAGAZINE 
HON. KWEISI MFUME 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an icon in the civil rights movement, 
business world, and political landscape, Mr. 
Earl G. Graves, who passed away on April 6, 
2020. 
Mr. Graves founded Black Enterprise maga-
zine in 1970, a publishing company dedicated 
to lifting up and recognizing Black entrepre-
neurship. Over the next 50 years, Mr. Graves 
took Black Enterprise from a single-magazine 
publishing company to a diversified multi- 
media business that spread the message of fi-
nancial empowerment to more than 6 million 
African Americans through print, digital, broad-
cast, and live-event platforms. He wrote a 
New York Times bestselling book in 1997, ti-
tled ‘‘How to Succeed in Business Without 
Being White,’’ that discussed the strategies he 
used to achieve such success, and was se-
lected as a finalist for the 1997 Financial 
Times/Booz-Allen & Hamilton Global Business 
Book Award. 
As a champion for Black excellence, Mr. 
Graves received numerous awards. Two years 
after launching Black Enterprise, he received 
the National Award of Excellence and was 
named one of the 10 most outstanding minor-
ity businessmen in the country by President 
Richard Nixon. He was named by Time maga-
zine as one of 200 future leaders of the coun-
try in 1974 and became part of the National 
Black College Hall of Fame in 1987. Mr. 
Graves has lectured at Yale University as a 
Poynter Fellow and received honorary degrees 
from more than 65 colleges and universities, 
including his alma mater, Morgan State Uni-
versity. In recognition of Mr. Graves’s staunch 
advocacy for higher education and equal op-
portunity, Morgan State renamed its school of 
business and management the Earl G. Graves 
School of Business and Management in 1995. 
In 2002, Fortune magazine named Mr. Graves 
one of the 50 most powerful and influential Af-
rican Americans in corporate America. 
Mr. Graves threw himself into causes and 
projects that supported and empowered his 
communities in New York and the Black com-
munity at large. He held a seat on the board 
of selectors of the American Institute for Public 
Service, the Advisory Council of the Character 
Education Partnership, the board of the Stead-
man-Hawkins Sports Medicine Foundation, the 
board of The Schomburg Center for Research 
in Black Culture, and the national advisory 
board of the National Underground Railroad 
Freedom Center. He was also a trustee of 
Howard University, the Committee for Eco-
nomic Development, the Special Contributions 
Fund of the NAACP, and the New York Eco-
nomic Club. He was appointed to serve on the 
presidential commission for the National Mu-
seum of African American History and Culture 
by the George W. Bush Administration and 
was a vice president on the national executive 
board and a member of the marketing com-
mittee for the national office of the Boy Scouts 
of America. 
Mr. Graves’s wife of 51 years, Mrs. Barbara 
Graves, was his closest companion. You didn’t 
see one without the other. She lived for him, 
he lived for her, and they both lived for their 
three children. All three sons, Earl ‘‘Butch’’ Jr., 
Johnny, and Michael, worked at Black Enter-
prise throughout their lives, developing their 
business acumen under the watchful eye of 
Mrs. Graves, who served as a mentor and 
guide to several generations of employees. 
Butch took over as CEO of Black Enterprise in 
2006, after spending decades growing the 
company together with his father. 
Earl G. Graves was raised in the Bedford 
Stuyvesant neighborhood of New York, where 
he learned hard work and perseverance from 
his parents, Earl Godwin and Winifred Sealy 
Graves. After receiving a B.A. in economics 
from Morgan State University, he served two 
years in the Army, followed by a three-year 
stint as Senator Robert F. Kennedy’s adminis-
trative assistant. After Kennedy’s assassina-
tion, Graves entered the business arena, 
where he realized his unprecedented success 
as a public servant, intellectual, and business-
man. 
It is my honor to stand today, Madam 
Speaker, in recognition of Earl G. Graves, a 
successful entrepreneur, caring father, dedi-
cated philanthropist, and friend.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
HUEL PERKINS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Huel Perkins on the occa-
sion of his retirement from FOX 2 Detroit after 
thirty-three years. His significant contributions 
to our Metro Detroit community are worthy of 
commendation. 
A native of Louisiana, Mr. Perkins first start-
ed working as an anchor in Baton Rouge. He 
planned on continuing law school until a new 
career path appeared in the form of a phone 
call and he moved to work at a local station 
in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1989, he joined TV 
2 in Detroit and has since then become a 
household name here in Metro Detroit. Along 
with his co-anchor, Monica Gayle, he is a part 
of one of the longest running anchor teams in 
Metro Detroit and has spent the last twenty- 
five years keeping the people of Southeastern 
Michigan informed on the issues of the day. 
Together they’ve covered the stories that de-
fine us—9/11, the inauguration of President 
Obama, Kwame Kilpatrick, and the memorable 
implosion of the Hudson Building in Downtown 
Detroit. 
The sharp and larger than life host of Let It 
Rip, Mr. Perkins has received two Emmy 
Awards for reporting and four nominations for 
Best Anchor. Known for his boundless opti-
mism, he has delivered the news that matters 
to Southeast Michigan with integrity and com-
passion. Mr. Perkins has traveled the world re-
porting on figures like Nelson Mandela and 
Pope, but this hasn’t stopped him from being 
engaged in the community he calls home. 
Over the years he has made a difference in 
the lives of so many Metro Detroiters and in 
return, Michigan has adopted him as of our 
own. Even as he leaves FOX 2, his words of 
wisdom will not be forgotten. Mr. Perkins re-
sides in Michigan with his wife Priscilla and to-
gether they have two sons, Jared and Vincent. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Huel Perkins for an ex-
emplary career at FOX 2 Detroit. I join with 
Mr. Perkin’s family, friends, and colleagues in 
extending my gratitude to him for his tireless 
commitment to our community and to thank 
him for his role in keeping the people of Michi-
gan informed for over three decades. Though 
we will miss his skilled reporting and seeing 
the familiar faces of Huel and co-anchor 
Monica on FOX 2, we wish him the very best 
in retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
ELNARDO WEBSTER 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to Dr. Elnardo Webster after his 
passing on March 22, 2022. Elnardo was a 
beloved School Superintendent, devoted hus-
band and father, and a proud member of the 
West Orange community. 
Dr. Webster was born on March 6, 1948, in 
Jersey City, NJ. He earned a B.S. and M.A. 
from Saint Peter’s University and, in 2000, he 
received a Doctorate in Educational Leader-
ship from Seton Hall University. While a stu-
dent, he played a pivotal role on the renowned 
1967–68 ‘‘Run Baby Run’’ men’s basketball 
team. Dr. Webster went on to play profes-
sional basketball for seven years with the New 
York Nets, Memphis Pros, Italy, Spain, Swit-
zerland, and Eastern League for the New York 
Knicks, In 2018, Dr. Webster was named to a 
list of the top 25 men’s college basketball 
players in New Jersey’s history. 
Following a distinguished career in edu-
cation, Dr. Webster retired as superintendent 
for Roselle Public Schools and became a con-
sultant for the Commissioner of the New Jer-
sey Department of Education as a Highly 
Skilled Professional. Of late, Dr. Webster 
served as director for Saint Peter’s Center for 
After 
School 
and 
Expanded 
Learning 
(C.A.S.E.L). He was a former council member 
of the West Orange Township Council and a 
former commissioner of the Hudson County 
Freeholders. 
Dr. Webster also served as a member of 
the Board of Trustees at Saint Peter’s Univer-
sity, a member of the Trustee Board of the 
Ethics Committee New Jersey Supreme Court 
District VI, a member of the Board of Trustees 
of the Urban League of Hudson County, a 
member of the King Solomon Masonic Lodge 
No. 19, and a member of the National Sorority 
of Phi Delta Kappa Alpha Chapter Anthropos. 
He will be greatly missed by his wife Sandra 
Webster, his two sons Elnardo and Damarko 
Webster, and his entire extended family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in celebrating the life of 
Dr. Elnardo Webster.

SAFEGUARDING 
TOMORROW 
THROUGH ONGOING RISK MITI-
GATION 
TECHNICAL 
CORREC-
TIONS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 5673, the Safe-
guarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk 
Mitigation Technical Corrections Act. 
This bill revises provisions related to the 
hazard mitigation revolving loan fund program, 
by requiring capitalization grant recipients to 
supplement these two most recently published 
editions of relevant building codes, specifica-
tions, and standards. 
The Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongo-
ing Risk Mitigation Act authorizes the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to 
enter into agreements with any state or Indian 
tribal government to make grants for the es-
tablishment of hazard mitigation revolving loan 
funds. 
The funding would enable local govern-
ments that carry out projects to reduce dis-
aster risks for homeowners, businesses, non-
profit organizations, and communities to de-
crease the loss of life and property, the cost 
of insurance claims, and federal disaster pay-
ments. 
The Infrastructure Act of 2021 provides 
$500 million to the STORM Act, or $100 mil-
lion per year for five years. 
This new FEMA grant program finances 
water, wastewater, infrastructure, disaster re-
covery, community, and small business devel-
opment projects. 
This revolving loan fund can be utilized for 
projects intended to protect against wildfires, 
earthquakes, flooding, storm surges, chemical 
spills, seepage resulting from chemical spills 
and floods, and any other event deemed cata-
strophic by FEMA. 
This legislation makes a huge impact on the 
nation’s efforts to prevent and recover from 
natural disasters. 
My community, the 18th Congressional Dis-
trict of Texas will benefit greatly from this bill. 
Houston’s Hurricane Harvey wreaked $125 
billion in damage to the Houston area. 
Houston’s Third and Fifth Wards and in sur-
rounding communities of Baytown and Gulfton, 
took the brunt of flooding damage due to Hur-
ricane Harvey in 2017. 
In February 2021, many of these same 
neighborhoods endured a much higher rate of 
power outages from Winter Storm Uri. 
These low-interest loans will allow for cities 
and states to repay the loan, with savings 
from mitigation projects. 
It also gives states the flexibility to prepare 
for oncoming disasters without paying high-in-
terest rates. 
They can invest in their communities—cut-
ting red tape and they will no longer have to 
wait on the federal government. 
For my district, and others living on the 
coast, it is not a matter of ‘‘if’’ a hurricane will 
strike our coast, it’s a matter of ‘‘when’’ it will 
strike. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 5673 because hazards are going to hap-
pen and we must do everything we can to pro-
tect our people. 
We 
need 
the 
Safeguarding 
Tomorrow 
through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Act.

Neyrely Munoz is a Freshman at Hofstra

BEATTY 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life of World War II veteran Alice 
Beatty and to honor her service in the Wom-
en’s Auxiliary Army Corp. 
Alice Beatty was born in Conway, Arkansas 
on August 23, 1921. At the age of 21, Alice 
joined the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps and 
landed on the beach at Normandy just weeks 
after D-Day. 
Alice Beatty was awarded the European-Af-
rican-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with 
one bronze star, the World War II Victory 
Medal, three overseas service bars, and the 
Women’s Army Corps Service Medal in rec-
ognition of her service during World War II. 
Alice was also the first woman in the state 
of Arkansas to receive the French Legion of 
Honor Medal. 
Alice was a pioneer of her time, and I am 
proud to highlight her service to our Nation 
and honor her memory during Women’s His-
tory Month.

REMEMBERING BRENDA HARRIS 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Brenda Harris and 
her legacy as an educator and a civil rights 
champion. Patti and I are deeply saddened by 
Brenda’s passing, and our hearts are with her 
family during this difficult time. 
In 1951, Harris was born in Montgomery, 
Alabama as the daughter of civil rights activ-
ists. After graduating high school, Harris 
moved to California to study communications 
and sociology at the University of San Fran-
cisco (USF). In 1972, Harris began to immerse 
herself in the world of education through tutor-
ing at Benjamin Franklin Middle School and 
counseling through Junior League. She went 
on to receive a master’s degree in administra-
tion and her elementary and secondary school 
teaching credentials. In 1990, Harris’ efforts 
culminated in her appointment to the position 
of Education Program Consultant by Dr. Shir-
ley Thornton, Deputy Superintendent of Spe-
cialized Programs at the California Department 
of Education. 
As the daughter for civil rights activists, Har-
ris was keenly aware of the disadvantages 
that underprivileged communities faced. While

continuing her successful work as an educa-
tor, she took up her parents’ cause and be-
came an impactful advocate for improving 
education in minority and economically dis-
advantaged neighborhoods. This led her to 
become a member of USF’s Board of Trust-
ees, where she was committed to supporting 
USF’s mission of social justice. 
In 2018, she was awarded the Engage San 
Francisco Community Partner Award for West-
ern Addition Changemakers. Harris’ life work 
undoubtedly had an indelible positive impact 
on countless students in California and in-
spired those around her. She will be deeply 
missed, and Patti and I send our condolences 
to the Harris family.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE POLISH AND 
SLAVIC CENTER 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the 
Polish and Slavic Center (PSC) on the occa-
sion of its 50th anniversary. For five decades, 
PSC has promoted the culture and heritage of 
Poland, whilst providing a broad range of serv-
ices and opportunities to the Polish American 
community. 
Working alongside Polish immigrants who 
had just arrived in New York City, Reverend 
Longin Tolcyzk established PSC in 1972. In 
the 50 years since, PSC has expanded rap-
idly, becoming an important cultural institution 
for the Polish-American community in the tri- 
state area and has over 40,000 members. 
Over the course of this period, PSC has 
continuously expanded the services it provides 
to the local community. For over 48 years, the 
Extended Social Services Program has pro-
vided information and assistance for elderly 
Polish and Slavic-Americans, in matters as 
varied as social security, healthcare, and 
housing. PSC further assists seniors by pro-
viding daily low-cost meals at the Krakus Sen-
ior Center and John Paul II Friendship Center. 
Since 1994, PSC has expanded its reach by 
providing 
immigration 
and 
legal 
support. 
Through its bilingual services, PSC works to 
provide free legal aid to all members of the 
community. Beyond these services, PSC of-
fers ESL classes each year to over 100 re-
cently arrived immigrants, and a scholarship 
program for Polish and Slavic-American youth 
seeking higher education degrees. 
PSC works to provide enriching cultural ex-
periences for all, partnering with both estab-
lished and emerging Polish and Slavic-Amer-
ican performers to host exhibitions, concerts, 
and other cultural events. PSC seeks to in-
spire creativity and confidence in the younger 
generation through programming for aspiring 
young artists. 
As PSC enters its sixth decade, it plans to 
continue expanding its services. A 3–K for All 
Preschool Program will serve the growing pop-
ulation of young Greenpoint families. PSC also 
plans to open a new cafeteria at its 177 Kent 
Street location. To enhance its cultural pro-
gramming, PSC intends to renovate its old 
church premises into a modern venue for 
holding concerts, conferences, and community 
gatherings. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in celebrating the ongoing work of 
PSC for the Polish and Slavic-American com-
munity. For 50 years, it has made a significant 
contribution in making New York the vibrant 
city of immigrants and diverse cultures that ex-
emplifies the promise of the United States and 
the American Dream.
