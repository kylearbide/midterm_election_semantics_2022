fore the House the following commu-

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, throughout human his-
tory You have acted on our behalf, de-
fended us against our enemies, saved us 
from our own sinfulness. And like 
those who have gone before us, we have 
failed to appreciate the mercy You 
have afforded us from the beginning of 
time. 
Show us the writing on the wall. Our 
days are numbered. It doesn’t matter 
whether we are counting the days of 
our life, or the time in our current vo-
cations, You have determined the days 
we are given to serve You. 
May we not be found wanting, having 
fallen short of the part we play in Your 
gracious design. 
May we instead look to all that You 
have done for us, all that You have 
promised, and remember how blessed 
we are. 
May we respond with full hearts and 
willing spirits, in our attitudes and ac-
tions, living lives worthy of Your 
mercy. 
May we speak Your truth in our 
every word with our colleagues and 
constituents, as to the stranger and to 
the estranged. 
And may we reflect to the world 
Your steadfast love to those around us, 
the poor and needy, the offensive and 
the irascible, friend and foe. 
Holy God, make our lives count in 
the economy of Your grace. In Your 
sovereign name, we pray. 
Amen.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROB-
ERT CHISOLM 
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Robert 
Chisolm, an American hero who passed 
away peacefully on January 4, 2022, 
after a lifetime of service to our coun-
try and to El Paso. 
Lieutenant Colonel Chisolm served in 
the Army in World War II, the Korean 
war, and the Vietnam war. He was a 
paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion when he parachuted into combat 
in Normandy, France, on D-day, a day 
that liberated Western Europe from 
Nazi rule. 
He was also recognized in 2012 by the 
French Government and awarded the 
French Legion of Honor medal. 
After 29 years of faithful service, he 
retired from the military and settled in 
El Paso, Texas, with his wife, Mar-
garet. 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Chisolm 
helped create a community for local 
veterans as a founding member of the 
Benavidez-Patterson 
All 
Airborne 
Chapter of the 82nd Airborne Division 
Association, which awards scholarships 
to the children and grandchildren of 
paratroopers. 
May 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Robert 
Chisolm’s legacy of devotion to our 
country, his fellow veterans, and his 
unwavering commitment to service 
continue to inspire us all. 
f 
HONORING THE CAREER OF COM-
MAND SERGEANT MAJOR JOHN 
F. SAMPA 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to pay tribute to the distinguished 
and exceptional career of my friend, 
Command Sergeant Major John F. 
Sampa, the retiring Command Ser-
geant Major of the Army National 
Guard. 
It is one of my greatest honors and 
privilege to have served with then-Ser-
geant John Sampa when I was a lieu-
tenant with Bravo Company 4th Bat-
talion 112th Armor, in Rosenberg, 
Texas. He mentored and advised count-
less soldiers and airmen throughout his 
career. 
His rise to the highest enlisted rank 
in the National Guard was not by 
chance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H46 
January 12, 2022 
Sampa is an extremely talented and 
competent 
noncommissioned 
officer 
who led by example, outworked his 
peers, and always took care of his 
troops. 
Along with the citizens from the 
great State of Texas, and the Army Na-
tional Guard soldiers throughout the 
country, I wish Command Sergeant 
Major John Sampa a well-deserved re-
tirement. He has served his neighbors, 
State, and country well. 
I wish John, his wife Carlette; son, 
John; and daughter, Julia, all the best 
in their future endeavors.

COMMEMORATING KOREAN- 
AMERICAN DAY 
(Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate Korean-American Day. I 
am proud to represent the largest Ko-
rean-American population of any con-
gressional district in the country. 
Tomorrow we recognize the 119th an-
niversary of the arrival of the first Ko-
rean immigrants to the United States, 
and the recognition that they have 
contributed to the life and well-being 
of the people of the United States for 
so many years. 
One person that is an example of that 
is Erin Pak, who leads the Kheir Cen-
ter, a community health center in Los 
Angeles. During the pandemic, they 
kept their doors open, taking care of 
anybody who needed help; everything 
from testing, to vaccine boosters, to 
people who are Korean, Latino, it 
didn’t matter their background. But 
their doors were open during the 
toughest times. 
It is with that kind of commitment 
that Korean Americans have really 
made not only L.A. a better place to 
live, but the United States a better 
place to live. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
my resolution to recognize the ideals of 
Korean-American Day and the essen-
tial contributions of Korean Americans 
to American life. 
f 
OPPOSITION TO PROXY VOTING 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, there is no 
substitute for conducting the business 
of the American people in person. 
On Monday, 80 members of the major-
ity voted ‘‘present’’ by proxy. This is 
one of the most asinine things that has 
become commonplace under one-party 
rule by the majority. 
Have House Democrats become so 
averse to work that they now believe 
voting from their couches is a viable 
option? 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to end proxy 
voting once and for all. It is one of the 
many blemishes that have been put on 
this great body under one-party rule. 
If the current majority won’t end 
proxy voting, Republicans will snuff it 
out entirely when we take back the 
House. It is past time to get back to 
work. 
f 
CONGRATULATIONS TO 
STARBUCKS WORKERS UNITED 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, from the steel mills to the 
auto plants, Buffalo and Western New 
York are communities that respect 
hard work and have a long and strong 
record of leading and supporting the 
labor movement. 
That tradition continues with local 
Starbucks workers. Despite pressure 
tactics and roadblocks, they were suc-
cessful in their bid to organize unions 
at Starbucks locations in Buffalo and 
Cheektowaga, New York. 
This weekend, I was proud to stand 
with the Starbucks Elmwood employ-
ees who were fighting for better work-
ing conditions. 
Today, I recognize the efforts of all 
workers who show courage and soli-
darity in their fight for fair wages and 
working conditions. 
Every social movement in America 
started from the ground up, from peo-
ple with passion and vision to demand 
better for their workplace, for their 
community, and for our collective fu-
ture. 
Congratulations to Starbucks Work-
ers United. Your organizing achieve-
ment is a victory for many and an in-
spiration to all. 
f 
ANOTHER YEAR OF DISRUPTED 
LEARNING 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, more 
than one million students started 2022 
with closed schools: another year of 
disrupted learning. 
In Chicago, more than 300,000 kids 
spent 4 days locked out of their class-
rooms. This is the same Chicago that 
received nearly $2 billion from the 
Democrats’ so-called COVID relief bill 
to keep schools open. 
We have an education and a mental 
health crisis on our hands. Every stu-
dent who is trapped behind a screen 
knows it. Every mom and dad who is 
anxious about another year of last- 
minute closures know it. Even Demo-
crat mayors and voters know it. 
And yet, President Biden said yester-
day, America is on the ‘‘right track’’ 
with regard to the pandemic. 
Mr. President, in what world is this 
considered the right track? 
Disrupted learning means we are 
leaving behind a generation of strug-
gling students. It might be the single 
most destructive policy imposed on our 
children this century. The negative 
consequences can last a lifetime. 
The only question we have now is, 
how do we save our kids from more dis-
ruption to their education in the days 
and weeks to come? 
The President of the United States 
could have gone to Chicago or any of 
the 5,400 schools that started off this 
year closed to send a clear signal that 
kids belong in the classroom. 
Instead, he was in Atlanta yesterday 
delivering a speech that was so self- 
serving and out-of-touch that even 
Stacey Abrams kept her distance. 
But I have a simple principle that 
every parent knows well: Our kids’ edu-
cation is not dispensable. Their futures 
are not dispensable. I believe that as a 
parent, as a lawmaker, and as an 
American citizen, and I know every 
House Republican believes it, too. 
We must be a society that pushes to 
do the best we can for the next genera-
tion, a society that finally achieves the 
goal of allowing every kid in every 
neighborhood to go to the school that 
their parents believe is best for them. 
House Republicans will work to make 
sure our children are the national pri-
ority they should be, even if this ad-
ministration 
and 
House 
Democrats 
won’t. 
f 
RECOGNIZING SOUTH METRO FIRE 
RESCUE 
(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the members of South 
Metro Fire Rescue for their bravery 
and professionalism in combating the 
devastating Marshall fire that swept 
across Boulder County. 
As we prepared to ring in the new 
year, Colorado experienced the most 
destructive wildfire in its history. 
Faced with hurricane-level winds that 
fueled rapid spread, our very own 
South Metro firefighters jumped into 
action. They sacrificed time with fam-
ily during the holidays and put their 
lives on the line to protect thousands 
of homes, save countless lives, and 
make our community proud. 
Rising temperatures and prolonged 
drought have made wildfires a part of 
everyday life in Colorado. As Colo-
radans inevitably face similar chal-
lenges in the coming years, I am grate-
ful to have the heroes at South Metro 
representing and protecting our com-
munity. 
I am honored to recognize the mem-
bers of South Metro Fire Rescue for 
their service to our community and 
thank them for inspiring a hope in our 
future, a hope that together we can 
face the challenges of this new future 
head-on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H47 
January 12, 2022 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, President 
Biden promised to ‘‘shut down the 
COVID–19 virus, not the country.’’ He 
also promised ‘‘access to regular, reli-
able, and free COVID–19 testing.’’ 
But as we near a year into his Presi-
dency, he has failed to deliver on these 
basic promises. In the Trump adminis-
tration we got Operation Warp Speed. 
However, for the Biden administration 
we seem to be getting operation no 
rush. 
President Biden alone is to blame for 
the current testing shortage that the 
American people are facing. Just look 
at the facts. 
In the spring of 2021, when a group of 
health agency officials approached the 
White House on a proposal to purchase 
millions of rapid tests, the White 
House officials never followed up. 
In October 2021, White House officials 
rejected a proposal for free rapid tests 
for the holiday season. 
In December 2021, President Biden 
announced that 500 million tests would 
be sent out in January 2022, however, 
the contract for these tests has yet to 
be signed. 
The bottom line is that President 
Biden failed to meet his promises, and 
the American people are paying the 
price.

A RISE IN GUN SALES AND THE 
MURDER RATE 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, the past 
year has seen an explosion in gun sales 
and, with it, a 30 percent rise in the 
murder rate. 
Yet, at a time when the data becomes 
increasingly clear that more guns in 
the hands of those who should not have 
them results in more deaths of those 
who should still be alive and with us 
today, Republican officials across the 
country are trying to make it easier 
for anyone to wield guns around our 
children and our families. 
Back in my home State of Georgia, 
our Governor is trying to implement 
permitless carry, irresponsible legisla-
tion that is dangerous for our law en-
forcement, dangerous for our families, 
and dangerous for the people that we 
love and cherish. 
We cannot allow these destructive ef-
forts to continue, and we must reaffirm 
our dedication to passing meaningful 
legislation that truly saves American 
lives. 
f 
THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
CONTINUES 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, a week 
after my visit to the border to meet 
with agents on the ground and survey 
the situation with my own eyes, I am 
here to report some unsurprising news. 
There is still a growing crisis at our 
Nation’s southern border. 
I saw firsthand how President Biden 
has ceded—not in farming, but given 
up—ceded control of the southern bor-
der to the cartels. 
Thankfully, Texas Governor Abbott 
has stepped up to enforce the law, but 
Federal border agents continue to lack 
critical federally provided resources. 
From halting construction of the 
wall and resisting the remain in Mex-
ico policy, to releasing illegals into our 
interior and pursuing mass amnesty, 
this President and Democrats in Con-
gress have incentivized a long-term 
border surge that will forever change 
our Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to reverse these 
America-last policies, secure the bor-
der, and uphold law and order in the 
face of this current administration’s 
refusal to do so. 
f 
NEW WAVE OF VOTER 
SUPPRESSION EFFORTS 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, we 
are seeing a wave of voter suppression 
efforts show their ugly heads across 
this country, a crisis of unprecedented 
proportion that is cracking at the very 
foundation of our democratic process. 
Republicans have continued to push 
lies and conspiracy theories to depress 
voter turnout and sow mistrust in our 
elections at the highest levels. 
It is time that we choose: the fili-
buster or our democracy. We cannot 
allow arcane Senate rules to stand in 
the way of this Congress upholding its 
most basic constitutional responsibil-
ities, at one of the most critical junc-
tures in our history. 
It is incumbent on us to restore the 
voting rights protections that our Na-
tion’s civil rights leaders bled to se-
cure. 
This Congress can and will fight 
against these draconian measures, to 
restore and expand the sacred right to 
vote. 
History will remember anyone who 
stands in our way. 
f 
JOBS DESTROYED UNDER 
PRESIDENT BIDEN 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the December jobs report 
came in at less than half of what was 
projected. People continue to suffer at 
the hands of the Biden and Democrat 
policies. Jobs are being destroyed. 
A recent national poll found that 68 
percent of respondents said the econ-
omy was a top concern. 
Inflation is a tax on all Americans, 
and it has gone up every month since 
the Biden Presidency. Gasoline is up 58 
percent; propane, kerosene, and fire-
wood are up 34 percent; bacon is up 21 
percent; and hamburger is up 20 per-
cent. 
Real wages have decreased under 
Biden in 8 of his 10 full months in of-
fice, with a loss of $5,000 per family. 
The Democrat elite think they are 
smarter than everyone, and Democrat 
voters and Democrat media are igno-
rant to believe that trillions of dollars 
cost zero dollars. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from the Afghani-
stan safe haven to America. Sadly, we 
are in day 151 of Americans left behind, 
as cited by Sean Hannity.

REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO FLIP- 
FLOP 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, MITCH 
MCCONNELL
and Senate Republicans 
have repeatedly taken a stand against 
the truth and common sense by devot-
ing themselves to the big lie, flip-flop-
ping from previous positions with the 
aim of satisfying a virulent base to ob-
tain power, defending the January 6 in-
surrection, and protecting violate rad-
ical extremists, passing dozens of anti- 
voting laws across the country, taking 
up dangerous and destructive efforts to 
take over and sabotage future elec-
tions, all with the aim of staying in 
power at the expense of democracy and 
what our Founders held dear. 
The flip-flop continues with the fili-
buster. Let’s be clear. MITCH MCCON-
NELL has a long record of changing the 
rules whenever it suits him, and he 
continues to mislead about the fili-
buster. There have been more than 161 
changes made to the filibuster in the 
last five decades, with the filibuster al-
tered to pass trade deals, tax cuts, and 
Supreme Court justices. 
The filibuster is not in the Constitu-
tion, and the Founders only mentioned 
supermajority for impeachment. 
They must do better on the other 
side of the aisle and the other side of 
this Capitol. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities towards Mem-
bers of the Senate.

HONORING BOB WOOLEY 
(Ms. HERRELL asked and was given

Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, today, 
it is my great honor to pay tribute to 
my friend and colleague, Bob Wooley.

served in the Army during the Vietnam 
war. His passion for helping our vet-
erans stems way beyond his service in 
the State; it stems throughout the Na-
tion. 
Bob is a no-nonsense cowboy. He has 
got a zest for life and a zest for serving 
God. He also has a zest for telling the 
truth, even if you didn’t want to hear 
it. 
I am honored today to recognize Bob 
and his beautiful wife of 48 years, 
Janna. They have two children and five 
grandchildren. 
Today, in New Mexico, we are cele-
brating Bob Wooley’s 75th birthday. On 
behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, I wish Bob Wooley a happy 75th

RECOGNIZING LAKEWOOD POLICE 
AGENT ASHLEY FERRIS 
(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Agent Ashley 
Ferris of the Lakewood Police Depart-
ment for her heroic actions which un-
doubtedly saved lives and protected our 
community from further violence. 
On December 27, 2021, the Denver and 
Lakewood, Colorado, communities ex-
perienced a terrible tragedy. A gunman 
opened fire at multiple locations in 
Denver before traveling to Lakewood 
where he continued the shooting spree. 
As a result of this gun violence, five 
lives were taken and two others were 
injured. My condolences go to the 
friends and family of the five victims 
of these murders: Alicia Cardenas, 
Danny Scofield, Sarah Steck, Alyssa 
Gunn-Maldonado, 
and 
Michael 
Swinyard. Jimmy Maldonado was in-
jured as well as Agent Ferris, who 
bravely confronted and killed the gun-
man even after being shot in the abdo-
men, 
undoubtedly 
preventing 
addi-
tional loss of life. 
The Lakewood Police Department 
said it best: ‘‘If not for the heroic ef-
forts of Agent Ferris and other law en-
forcement, this incredibly violent trag-
edy could have been even worse.’’ 
Agent Ferris was previously recog-
nized for her actions on the job in 2020 
when she, along with two fellow Lake-
wood Police Officers, performed life-
saving measures on a woman suffering 
medical distress. For her actions, she 
was presented with the department’s 
Lifesaving Award. 
I am thankful Agent Ashley Ferris 
was recently released from the hos-
pital. I wish her a full and speedy re-
covery, and I extend my deepest appre-
ciation for her bravery, sacrifice, and 
service to our community. 
f 
CALIFORNIA’S STATEWIDE 
DROUGHT EMERGENCY 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, in the 
midst of a statewide drought emer-
gency, 
California 
has 
experienced 
much-needed rain and snowfall during 
these winter months. 
While communities across my dis-
trict are especially grateful for the 
rainfall we have encountered, I remain 
concerned that the State of California 
has already announced a zero percent 
allocation for water deliveries for this 
year. 
I also remain concerned that the Bu-
reau of Reclamation could possibly an-
nounce a similar water allocation for 
2022 within the next month. 
This is unacceptable. 
We must work together to figure out 
a way to fully utilize the water we 
have access to in a way that benefits 
our communities and agriculture pro-
duction. Farmers are desperate for 
water to grow their crops. Rural towns 
continue to face water shortages. 
We need this rain, but we also need 
to do a better job of managing our re-
sources. We have opportunities to move 
our 
water 
responsibly 
when 
the 
snowpack melts. 
As you can see here, more than 5 mil-
lion acre-feet of water was sent out to 
the ocean over this past year. This 
water could have gone a long way for 
our communities and for farmers in the 
Central Valley. 
I have asked time and time again for 
support from the House majority to ad-
dress this issue. The families of the 
Central Valley cannot continue to 
wait. I ask my colleagues yet again to 
join my efforts to improve water man-
agement in California. 
f 
BENEFITS OF THE BIPARTISAN 
INFRASTRUCTURE LAW 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to share how the recent enact-
ment of the bipartisan infrastructure 
law is already delivering for organized 
labor and businesses in the First Dis-
trict of Indiana. 
My district is home to three airports 
that are drivers of our economy. They 
are essential to moving goods and peo-
ple throughout the region and Nation 
and create good-paying jobs and in-
creased economic opportunities. 
According to the Federal Aviation 
Administration, three regional airports 
are expected to receive funds under the 
bipartisan infrastructure law, includ-
ing over $150,000 to the Michigan City 
Municipal Airport, almost $300,000 to 
the Porter County Regional Airport, 
and over $750,000 to the Gary/Chicago 
International Airport. 
I look forward to continuing the

HONORING MATT PEDIGO 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor Matt Pedigo of Allen County, 
Kentucky, who recently retired as gen-
eral manager of the Citizen-Times 
newspaper in Scottsville. 
After 22 years of reporting on the 
community he loves, Matt decided to 
put down his pen and pursue other ven-
tures. At a time when many people are 
distrustful of the agenda of the media, 
Matt has been a shining star over the 
years, accurately reporting on current 
events and happenings in Allen County. 
Through numerous interviews and 
conversations with Matt during my 
years in public service, I grew to appre-
ciate his work ethic, knowledge of the 
issues, and passion for sharing the 
news with his community. 
While he may be retiring, I know 
from my interactions with Matt that 
he is not finished making positive con-
tributions to the community of Allen 
County and south-central Kentucky. I 
wish him nothing but the best in a 
well-earned 
retirement 
from 
jour-
nalism.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDNA 
BROWN 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to pay trib-
ute to distinguished Ohio Senator Edna 
Brown, a trailblazer who 
recently 
passed away. 
Edna Brown was a remarkable public 
servant from Toledo, Ohio, who dedi-
cated her life and her three decades of 
service to improving the well-being and 
future of our community. 
As the first and only African Amer-
ican to represent Lucas County in the 
Ohio Senate, she blazed a trail for 
many to follow at the highest level of 
elected office in Ohio. 
She was a warm, inviting, and im-
mensely kind person whose focus was 
always on public service and bettering 
the lives of the people she served, the 
people she truly loved. 
Northwest Ohio lost a great cham-
pion. Her family lost a great mother 
and grandmother. America needs more 
people like Edna Brown in public serv-
ice. 
Her memory will live with us, and I 
know her legacy will inspire the next 
generation of Ohio’s leaders, including 
women leaders. 
I will include her life story and her 
obituary in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
as a tribute to her persevering accom-
plishments for our Nation’s better-
ment. 
Godspeed, Edna Brown. May the an-
gels carry you very high, and may you 
rest in peace.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
HENRY AND ARLENE LANGREHR 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize an incredible 
veteran from my district for his service 
to our country and eastern Iowa. 
Henry Langrehr of Clinton served in 
Europe during World War II with the 
82nd Airborne Division. Because of his 
heroic and brave actions in France, he 
received two Bronze Stars, two Purple 
Hearts, and the French Legion of 
Honor. 
Henry was a paratrooper who flew on 
a C–47 transport plane across the 
English Channel before being dropped 
into Normandy on D-day during the Al-
lied invasion. 
During the campaign, Henry was in-
jured by shrapnel and taken as a Ger-
man prisoner of war. He successfully 
escaped a Nazi work camp and made 
his way back to his countrymen. 
Henry always makes sure to praise 
Arlene, his wife of nearly 80 years. 
While Henry was in Europe, Arlene 
worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
making machine gun stands needed for 
the war effort, a real-life Rosie the Riv-
eter. 
I am incredibly grateful to have 
amazing Americans like Henry and Ar-
lene living in my district. 
Thank you for your incredible service 
to and love for the United States, Iowa, 
and Clinton.

CONGRATULATING THE GEORGIA 
BULLDOGS 
(Mr. HICE of Georgia asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to congratulate this year’s college 
football national championship team, 
the Georgia Bulldogs. 
For the first time since 1980, the 
Bulldogs are bringing the college foot-
ball 
national 
championship 
trophy 
back to Athens, Georgia, after beating 
the Alabama Crimson Tide by a score 
of 33–18 this past Monday. 
I could not be more proud of the 
Dawgs for showing all of us the true 
definition of heart, of character, and of 
dedication. 
After losing to the Crimson Tide in 
the SEC championship game a few 
weeks back, the Bulldogs worked, they 
prepared, they practiced with intense 
focus in order to come back and win 
the national championship. 
This team really gave us everything 
they had. They put it all on the field, 
and I am humbled to represent the Uni-
versity of Georgia and the 10th Con-
gressional District of Georgia. 
The Dawg spirit never ceases to 
amaze me. I want to extend sincere 
congratulations to the entire team, to 
Coach Kirby Smart and his coaching 
staff, and to the entire Dawg Nation. 
Go Dawgs. Congratulations. It has 
been a great season.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
DR. ANTHONY ORTEGON 
(Mrs. BOEBERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to commemorate the life of Dr. An-
thony Ortegon of Pueblo, Colorado. 
Dr. Ortegon and his amazing, strong, 
powerful wife, Vera, realized their 
American Dream early on. He will be 
remembered by those he loved as a 
God-fearing, 
country-loving, 
family 
man who was defined by his strong 
work ethic and love for helping others. 
Dr. Ortegon was born in Bogota, Co-
lombia, and made a courageous move 
to America, determined to create a 
better life for himself and his family. 
He finished college in 21⁄2 years and at-
tended the University of Miami’s med-
ical school to begin his passion for 
medicine and his patients, whom he 
loved. His work ethic was guided by his 
faith in God, and he trusted that he 
could build a life for himself in Amer-
ica. 
He served the community of Pueblo 
for over 40 years, providing care to 
thousands 
of 
southern 
Coloradans 
through his medical practice, and he 
owned several small businesses. His 
spirit will live on through his strong 
wife, Vera; his sons, Anthony and Ar-
thur; 
his 
four 
grandchildren; 
and 
through his impact on the community 
as a constant reminder of the potential 
of the American Dream.

DONALD HUISENGA RECEIVES 
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AT AGE 98 
(Mr. PFLUGER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with an incredible and inspira-
tional 
story 
to 
congratulate 
San 
Angelo’s Donald Huisenga on receiving 
his high school diploma after nearly 80 
years of waiting. 
Although originally in the class of 
1943, he was drafted into World War II 
just 3 months before graduation was 
scheduled. 
His service with the U.S. Army Spe-
cial Forces took Mr. Huisenga behind 
enemy lines and to the front of the D- 
day charge. 
Recently, after Ms. Tess Gooding of 
San Angelo’s VA clinic met with Mr. 
Huisenga and heard him mention al-
ways wanting to receive his diploma 
and graduate from high school, she got 
the ball rolling, and she went above 
and beyond the call of duty. And so did 
Mr. Huisenga’s original high school dis-
trict, East Sac County. 
Last Wednesday, alongside friends 
and family, Mr. Huisenga was awarded 
his high school diploma at the ripe age 
of 98 years old. 
It is touching to hear this story of 
service. I want to honor not only Mrs. 
Gooding for her work in the commu-
nity, for her compassion, and for going 
above and beyond, but I would also like 
to honor Mr. Huisenga for his sacrifice 
to our country in World War II and for 
his continued desire to learn, teaching 
us an important lesson that it is never 
too late in life to learn. 
I thank everyone who helped Mr. 
Huisenga earn his diploma. They have 
all made us very proud. Congratula-
tions on this incredible achievement. 
f 
CPI’S ASTONISHING INCREASE 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, today the latest Consumer Price 
Index numbers were revealed, con-
firming what Americans buying gas, 
groceries, and other necessities already 
know. Over the past year, the CPI in-
creased an astonishing 7 percent. 
That is the highest inflation rate we 
have seen in four decades. The last 
time we saw inflation like this, the 
University of Georgia football program 
had already begun its historic 40-plus- 
year championship drought that ended 
this week. 
This catastrophe could have been 
avoided, could have been headed off. 
But last July, despite economists in-
sisting it was a fantasy, the Biden ad-
ministration brushed off inflation con-
cerns as just a transitory inconven-
ience. 
Of course, Biden—or at least his 
string-pullers—knew better, but he did 
not want the daunting economic reali-
ties facing American families to get in 
the way of this massive socialist tax- 
and-spend agenda. 
You don’t need an economics degree 
to know that trillions more in govern-
ment spending will drive up inflation. 
Unfortunately, that is exactly what we 
are seeing. 
If the Biden administration and the 
House Democrats get their way and 
pass this harmful Build Back Better 
scheme with trillions more in spending, 
inflation will soar like never before. 
Americans are suffering. We must de-
feat the Democratic agenda, restore 
fiscal sanity, and take meaningful 
steps to combat the record inflation 
crushing American families and busi-
nesses.

FBI SHOULD NOT INTIMIDATE 
PARENTS 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the

Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-

Education was involved in requesting a

Association, calling for the FBI to in-
timidate parents who have shown up to 
school board meetings.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 1836, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1836, as amended, Representa-
tive LEVIN’s Guard and Reserve GI Bill 
Parity Act of 2021. 
This bill is a long-needed fix to the 
unequal treatment of members of the 
Guard and Reserve for GI Bill purposes. 
Under current law, guard and reserv-
ists do not accrue education benefits 
the same as their Active-Duty counter-
parts, even when they are carrying out 
the same duties and taking on the 
same risks. 
We live in a new age of national de-
fense where we utilize the total force 
concept with an operational reserve, 
not a Strategic Reserve. We rely each 
day on guard and reservists to protect 
and defend our country. As we observed 
the anniversary of the January 6 at-
tack on the Capitol, we were reminded 
of the brave Guard and Reserve troops 
who deployed to protect Congress, our 
staffs, and the foundation of our de-
mocracy. 
We continue to rely on our Reserve 
components throughout the COVID–19 
pandemic to activate and support pub-
lic health response efforts across the 
country. The National Guard has been 
utilized at unprecedented levels in re-
cent years. 
Over the past 2 years, our Reserve 
components have fought wildfires, re-
sponded to protests, assisted with the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan, and even 
helped Afghan refugees settle in the 
United States. 
It is time the Guard and Reserve ben-
efits reflect the key work they are 
doing and the need for equity across 
the total force. It is time for every day 
in uniform to count. 
The cadence of activations for guard 
and reservists has increased signifi-
cantly over the last 5 years, and with 
that comes the need to meet mission 
readiness standards. 
To prepare for the critical role they 
fulfill in our national defense, guard 
and reservists must frequently train, 
which means more days in uniform, 
more days away from their civilian 
life, and more days away from their 
families. 
b 1245 
The GI Bill is both a recruitment and 
transition benefit to help servicemem-
bers transition into civilian life and 
close the opportunity gap with their ci-
vilian peers. 
Now, the Guard and Reserves need 
this more than ever as they are con-
stantly transitioning between military, 
civilian employment, and family life, 
facing continuous disruptions. 
This legislation rectifies the dis-
parity and ensures that members of our 
Reserve forces know that every day 
they commit to our Nation counts, and 
that they will have the education bene-
fits waiting for them when they fulfill 
their commitment. 
In both this and the 116th Congress, 
we reformed and updated the Post-9/11 
GI Bill to ensure students who are eli-
gible have easy access to a high-quality 
education. 
We have implemented strong student 
protections and we are holding bad act-
ing institutions accountable when they 
fail to meet standards we set for vet-
eran education. 
Now, if servicemembers can step up 
and do their part day in and day out

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H51 
January 12, 2022 
while holding down civilian jobs and 
squeezing in time to take care of their 
families, then the least we can do here 
in Congress is to get out of the way of 
the solution. 
Now, there are troubling reports of 
upticks in suicide among our guard and 
reservists. 
One of the best ways we can address 
veteran health, mental health, and ul-
timate veteran suicide is by providing 
veterans with support and a pathway 
to a successful civilian life. 
H.R. 1836, as amended, will give guard 
and reservists access to the opportuni-
ties that post-secondary education and 
training provide and improve their re-
integration into civilian life. 
This legislation is fully paid for and 
uses loan fee provisions that this Con-
gress and prior Congresses have sup-
ported. In addition, even the Repub-
lican substitute uses the same offsets. 
Besides just being the right thing to 
do, investing in equitable GI Bill bene-
fits for guard and reservists will pro-
vide more than a tenfold return to our 
country. 
Who are we to stand in the way of an 
educational benefit that will not only 
make our country stronger, but will 
benefit our military by having military 
servicemembers and our guard and re-
servists who are even more able to do 
their jobs on behalf of our national de-
fense? I can’t wait to see what our 
servicemembers will do with this op-
portunity, and I know it will make our 
country a better country. 
This legislation is endorsed by nu-
merous VSOs, including the American 
Legion, the VFW, the Student Vet-
erans of America, the National Guard 
Association of the United States, En-
listed Association of the National 
Guard of the United States, and Re-
serve Officers of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I insert in the RECORD 
letters of support and statements from 
the American Legion, the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, the National Guard As-
sociation of the United States, Mili-
tary-Veterans Advocacy, and the Re-
serve Officers of America. 
THE AMERICAN LEGION, 
Washington, DC. 
Tomorrow we are expecting the House to 
take votes on H.R. 1836, the Guard and Re-
serve GI Bill Parity Act. The American Le-
gion supports this bill as our signature edu-
cation priority for 2022, and we strongly urge 
Representative Valadao to stand for DC’s 
National Guard troops and support its pas-
sage. 
All 50 states have activated components of 
their National Guard in response to unfore-
seen challenges over the past two years. 
From protecting borders to delivering pan-
demic aid and supporting local law enforce-
ment our National Guard and Reserve troops 
have responded to new challenges like never 
before. Often, they are leaving both their 
families and civilian employers for an ex-
tended amount of time sometimes taking a 
sizeable pay cut with them. Yet despite all 
we ask of them, too often they are denied a 
cornerstone benefit for our nation’s vet-
erans: the GI Bill. 
This is because servicemembers are acti-
vated under non-DNE title 32 orders which 
VA statutes currently don’t recognize as 
valid ‘‘active duty’’ time. H.R. 1836 would fix 
this disparity by expanding access to the 
Post-9/11 GI Bill for servicemembers acti-
vated under Title 32 orders towards benefits 
eligibility. 
The American Legion urges support for 
H.R. 1836. 
Thank you and happy to answer any ques-
tions. 
JOHN KAMIN, 
Legislative Associate, Legislative Division. 
VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS 
DO THE RIGHT THING FOR GUARD AND RESERVE 
MEMBERS 
Now is the time for Congress to pass legis-
lation to allow National Guard and Reserve 
members to rightfully earn GI Bill benefits 
for their time served. National Guard and 
Reserve members serve alongside active duty 
service members and consistently make sac-
rifices without always earning VA education 
benefits. Congress must act to expand eligi-
bility to allow the increasingly frequent ac-
tivations of these service members to count 
toward Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility. 
The VFW strongly supports H.R. 1836, 
Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021, 
to ensure equity of benefits for Reserve com-
ponent service members. This bill would 
allow any day in uniform receiving military 
pay to count toward Post-9/11 GI Bill eligi-
bility, allowing activated National Guard 
and Reserve members to earn this education 
benefit and achieve upward mobility. For 
years, the sacrifices of these service mem-
bers have been overlooked in achieving GI 
Bill eligibility. These inequities have been 
further highlighted through the COVID–19 
pandemic as National Guard and Reserve 
members stood on the front lines admin-
istering relief and health services. The time 
is now for parity with all the armed forces in 
earning their VA education benefits. 
Contact your representatives today and 
tell them to support the Guard and Reserve 
GI Bill Parity Act of 2021. Congress must 
pass this crucially needed legislation now. 
National Guard and Reserve members have 
been waiting long enough! 
NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION 
OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC. 
Good Morning, I am writing to express the 
National Guard Association’s strong support 
for H.R. 1836—the bipartisan Guard and Re-
serve GI Bill Parity Act, that will be consid-
ered this week on the House floor. This bill 
caps a years-long effort to recognize the 
service and sacrifice of our National Guard. 
In addition to acknowledging the service of 
our Guard Soldiers and Airmen, this bill will 
prove a hugely significant recruiting and re-
tention tool as we continually deploy Guard 
units to contingencies both at home and 
abroad. 
While we understand the concerns relating 
to costs in the out years, we ask that you 
vote NO on the Substitute amendment (H.R. 
2047). While this amendment would reduce 
long term costs, it significantly reduces the 
reach and impact of the legislative change 
and eliminates the central goal of parity in 
benefit as it relates to training H.R. 1836 is 
trying to accomplish. 
The bipartisan H.R. 1836 will prove to be 
the most significant Post-9/11 G.I. Bill 
change specifically for the Reserve Compo-
nent since the creation of the program itself 
and we are excited for the prospect of this 
bill passing the House of Representatives. 
Additionally, we look forward to continued 
bipartisan discussions with your Senate col-
leagues as we work towards final language 
on this critical issue to your National Guard 
servicemembers. 
Thanks for your consideration, please feel 
free to reach out for any additional informa-

Hon. MIKE LEVIN, 
Member of Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE LEVIN, On behalf of 
Military-Veterans Advocacy ® (MVATM), we 
would like to pledge our support for HR 1836. 
This bill will ensure that the time during 
which members of the Armed Forces serve on 
active duty for training qualifies for edu-
cational assistance under the Post–9/11 Edu-
cational Assistance Program of the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs. Specifically, the 
bill adjusts the type of service that entitles 
a member of the Armed Forces, reserves, or 
National Guard to such assistance. Under the 
bill, service by a reservist or National Guard 
member that is entitled to pay counts to-
ward benefit eligibility. Such service in-
cludes training, active military service, in-
active training, and general duty for which 
basic pay is warranted. 
You may use this letter as evidence of our 
support for this bill. Feel free to use it in 
Committee or in press releases. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN B. WELLS, 
Chairman of the Board. 
ROA 
RESERVE STRENGTH RESERVE LIFE 
ACTION CENTER—VOTE FOR HR 1836, GI BILL 
PARITY ACT 
Floor vote today on H.R. 1836! This bill ex-
pands eligibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill edu-
cational assistance to include all paid points 
days for National Guard and Reserve service 
members. This means that service members 
can earn GI Bill eligibility days for training, 
active military service, inactive training, 
and general duty for which basic pay is war-
ranted. Active duty earns benefits when 
training, and this bill would allow the Guard 
and Reserve to earn the same benefit. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Speaker NANCY
PELOSI
and Leader 
STENY HOYER for considering this legis-
lation today, and I urge the rest of my 
colleagues to support this legislation 
to ensure every day a guard or reserv-
ist spends in uniform counts toward 
earning vital GI Bill benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 1836, as amended, the 
Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act 
of 2021. 
While I support the intent of this 
bill, I do not believe that it is the right 
solution for our Nation’s guard and re-
servists at this time. 
Founded in 1636, the National Guard 
evolved from groups of colonial mili-
tias into one of the toughest and one of 
the most professional fighting forces in 
the world. 
From defeating the British during 
the American Revolution, to fighting 
in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
the Reserve component has served in 
every major conflict in the history of 
this Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H52 
January 12, 2022 
In recent years, the Guard and Re-
serve have been called up more often as 
their missions have changed. 
These brave men and women are not 
only on the front lines overseas, but 
they are also deployed at home to pro-
tect the southern border and assist in 
the response to COVID–19, among oth-
ers. 
We must never forget the sacrifices 
the men and women in the Guard and 
Reserve make when the Federal Gov-
ernment calls on them to serve. 
I agree that Congress must take a 
hard look at duty status reform and 
the potential expansion of benefits for 
guard and reservists. But this bill be-
fore us today would be an unwise ex-
pansion of benefits. 
The higher level of sacrifice of Ac-
tive-Duty servicemembers is reflected 
in the higher level of benefits provided 
by the VA. This is why the government 
recognizes the increased sacrifices of 
the Reserve component when they are 
called up on most Federal Active-Duty 
orders. 
I believe that one of the biggest mis-
understandings in this debate is that 
many of the types of Federal Active- 
Duty service that members of the Na-
tional Guard and Reserve perform al-
ready qualify for the GI Bill eligibility. 
I support the goal of ensuring that 
all time spent on nontraining Active 
Duty Federal orders should count to-
wards GI Bill eligibility. 
However, the bill before us today 
would go far beyond that and provide 
eligibility for the GI Bill for service re-
lated to annual training and drilling 
weekends. 
Training has never counted towards 
eligibility, and members of the Guard 
and Reserve know that when they sign 
up. Let me say that again. Training 
has never counted towards eligibility 
with members of the Guard and Re-
serves. They knew it when they signed 
up. It is the additional call-ups to Fed-
eral Active-Duty service that members 
of the Guard and Reserve may not 
know about. 
This type of service would be covered 
by Congressman MOORE’s amendment, 
which I believe is a better alternative. 
Also, covering training is the largest 
cost driver of this bill, which leads to 
my second point. 
The CBO projects that the expansion 
of benefits laid out in this bill would 
require nearly $2 billion in mandatory 
offsets for the first 10 years following 
enactment. While these costs are paid 
for in the current budget window, that 
does not tell the whole story. 
CBO also estimates that this bill will 
cost taxpayers more than $5 billion in 
each of the next four decades after fis-
cal year 2032. This would equate to at 
least 20 billion extra dollars over the 
next 50 years. 
None of these extra costs are offset, 
which means our children and grand-
children will be paying for them and be 
paying them off for many years to 
come. 
In a tight fiscal environment, I be-
lieve that full Active-Duty benefits for 
training and drilling is a bridge too far. 
I am also concerned that the offsets 
that are used in this bill should be 
saved for higher priority issues like ex-
panding services to toxic-exposed vet-
erans. 
Addressing the needs of toxic-exposed 
veterans is both my and Chairman 
TAKANO’s number one priority that we 
are trying to deal with right now. That 
could require Congress to find hundreds 
of billions of dollars in offsets. Offsets 
are few and far between in the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. We will need 
every penny of them to enact these 
needed reforms that we were talking 
about earlier. 
Earlier this week before the Rules 
Committee, Chairman TAKANO
indi-
cated that $2 billion is an insignificant 
amount compared to the potential full 
cost of addressing toxic exposure, and 
therefore, is not worthy to try to save 
here. I disagree. 
It is silly that I even have to say 
this, but $2 billion is a lot of money. It 
is worth saving. Ask any taxpayer. And 
remember, the people we are talking 
about are taxpayers, as well. 
Like me, my constituents and many 
Americans are concerned that Congress 
doles out billions of taxpayer dollars 
like candy. That must end. We can pro-
vide needed benefits for veterans with-
out burdening future generations. But 
that requires Congress to make tough 
decisions and to put first things first. 
Many of my concerns could have been 
discussed, debated, and possibly even 
addressed if the majority had con-
ducted the proper level of engagement 
with committee members, VA, and 
other stakeholders on this bill. 
The majority did not hold a single 
legislative hearing on this bill this 
Congress. As such, we were not able to 
receive views from the committee 
members, 
the 
administration, 
the 
mortgage industry, or veteran service 
organizations. Those views are a crit-
ical part of the legislative process. 
Why was this bill not put on the 
agenda for one of the two legislative 
hearings the Subcommittee on Eco-
nomic Opportunity held this Congress? 
This is no way to responsibly legis-
late, and I implore Chairman TAKANO 
to go back to our committee’s bipar-
tisan tradition of conducting full legis-
lative due diligence before sending bills 
to the House floor. 
In closing, I am supportive of review-
ing and, where warranted, expanding 
benefits for members of the Guard and 
Reserve. However, we must do so in a 
way that is fiscally responsible, appro-
priate, and respects the many dif-
ferences between Guard and Reserve 
service and Active-Duty service. 
The bill before us today does not 
meet that standard. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Before I yield to my distinguished 
colleague, I am going to make a few re-
marks in reference to what the ranking 
member said. 
I will first say that the bill has been 
in the public for more than 2 years. In 
fact, the committee held a Guard-and- 
Reserve-only benefits hearing just over 
a year ago to review the disparity in 
these benefits, and we have worked 
closely with the stakeholders, as evi-
denced by the numerous numbers of 
VSOs whose support letters I entered 
into the RECORD earlier. And we also 
worked with the minority to ensure 
that this bill achieves the aims that we 
intend. 
We have also worked closely with the 
Department of Defense and VA to en-
sure all Guard and Reserve members 
are covered. 
The VSOs have been asking for this 
reform, and that is why we stand with 
them in support of H.R. 1836. 
Now, moreover, it is not accurate to 
say that before the Rules Committee 
yesterday I characterized the $2 billion 
cost of this bill, which is paid for, as 
insignificant. I merely compared it to 
the idea that we should use this bill as 
part of an offset for the $300 billion or 
so that we are going to need for toxic 
exposure. And I thank the ranking 
member for joining together in trying 
to find a solution for our toxic-exposed 
veterans. 
However, that $300 billion, I know we 
are going to figure out how to take 
care of that. It is really not a choice; it 
is a moral obligation we have to those 
veterans that were exposed to burn 
pits. It is not a choice. It is a cost of 
war, and we have got to rise together 
as a body. We found $30 billion willy- 
nilly to add to the National Defense 
Authorization Act. We will find the 
$300 billion. We don’t need to be nickel 
and diming our reservists and our 
Guard units and deny them the days 
that should count toward their GI Bill 
benefits because they are doing every 
bit the same sort of readiness training 
that our Active-Duty servicemembers 
are doing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. LEVIN), 
my good friend and chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Economic Oppor-
tunity who is also the author of this 
very impressive bill. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Chairman TAKANO for yield-
ing and for his support and partnership 
on this legislation and all the work 
that he does leading our committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Par-
ity Act, bipartisan legislation I intro-
duced to deliver some basic fairness in 
the way we provide GI Bill benefits for 
the men and women who serve our Na-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, the GI Bill has allowed 
millions of veterans to pursue higher 
education and find rewarding career 
paths.

they choose to serve in our Armed 
Forces because of the opportunities 
those benefits provide for them and 
their families. However, the way that 
we allow servicemembers to accrue GI 
benefits is inherently unfair. While Ac-
tive-Duty servicemembers receive cred-
it for GI Bill benefits every day that 
they are in the service, Guard and Re-
serve members only accrue those bene-
fits in very limited circumstances. 
That disparity continues to exist de-
spite the fact that Guard and Reserve 
members are increasingly taking on 
the same risks and doing the same jobs 
as their Active-Duty counterparts. We 
have seen this trend for decades but it 
has become especially pronounced over 
the last 2 years. 
In response to the attack on our Cap-
itol on January 6 of last year, 25,000 
National Guard members mobilized 
from 54 States and territories to pro-
tect this institution. For a time, they 
slept on the cold, hard floors of this 
building. 
National 
Guard 
members 
have also deployed across our country 
to support the COVID–19 response, in-
cluding Guard members who deployed 
from Ohio, Maryland, Delaware, and 
Georgia to assist healthcare operations 
this month. 
In 2020, 1,300 soldiers and airmen 
from five different States were mobi-
lized to fight wildfires in my State of 
California and throughout the West 
Coast. Not only are these National 
Guard and Reserve members risking 
their lives to serve our country, but 
they are also forced to put their civil-
ian lives on hold when they are called 
up, leaving behind their families and 
interrupting civilian careers. Simi-
larly, they are forced to put their lives 
on hold every time they are called up 
for training. In some of those settings 
they are serving side by side with Ac-
tive Duty members doing similar jobs 
and facing similar risks, but they are 
not earning the same GI Bill benefits 
as their peers. That is unacceptable 
and it is shameful that we have asked 
Guard and Reserve members to step up 
in response to natural disasters, the 
pandemic, and an attack on our democ-
racy without providing them with this 
fundamental benefit. 
Clearly, it is long past time that we 
provide some basic fairness in the way 
that we allow Guard and Reserve mem-
bers to accrue these benefits. The legis-
lation that we are considering today 
will do exactly that, with a simple fix 
to ensure that every day they spend in 
uniform counts towards their GI Bill 
benefits. 
Now, I know my friends on the other 
side of the aisle might raise concerns 
about the costs of expanding eligibility 
for these benefits, and I would note 
that this bill includes provisions my 
Republican colleagues have supported 
in the past to help defray the cost of 
veterans’ benefits. And to my col-
leagues who still are not willing to pay 
for these benefits, I would ask them to 
share their concerns directly with 
Guard and Reserve members the next 
time they are deployed in response to a 
natural disaster or other emergency in 
the community that they represent. 
So I think we all want the same 
thing. My friends across the aisle, us 
on this side of the aisle, we all want 
the same thing. We all want to provide 
benefits to those who have served our 
country. I believe that in good faith. I 
do think that we have to not pay lip 
service, though. We have to make sure 
that we support servicemembers and 
not just when it is politically conven-
ient. We don’t need half measures. We 
don’t need things that shortchange our 
servicemembers. So I think it is time 
for us to step up. It is time to give 
them the benefits they have earned for 
protecting the American people in a 
way now that they are doing unlike be-
fore. And that is what this bill aims to 
do. 
As the chairman mentioned, it has 
support from a wide range of veteran 
service organizations, including the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Student 
Veterans of America, the National 
Guard 
Association 
of 
the 
United 
States, the Enlisted Association of the 
National Guard of the United States, 
and Reserve Officers Association. They 
are asking us to pass this bill, the 
Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, 
today because they agree that it is past 
time to provide some basic fairness in 
the way that we provide GI Bill bene-
fits to Guard and Reserve members. 
Mr. Speaker, passing this bipartisan 
bill is the right thing to do for all the 
men and women who serve and protect 
our Nation, and I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, just quickly 
before I yield time to my colleague 
from Ohio, I would like to remind the 
Members that training for members of 
National Guard and Reserve has never 
been counted towards GI Bill eligi-
bility. Members of Guard and Reserve 
know that, as I said in my opening, 
when they sign up. 
Now, the Democrat majority did not 
hold a legislative hearing on this bill, 
so to that extent, the expansion of eli-
gibility was needed to increase recruit-
ment and retention within the Guard 
and Reserve component and DOD, but 
DOD did not have the opportunity to 
testify to that before the committee 
because we didn’t meet. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP), 
who has actually served both in the Re-
serve and Active component of our 
military. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss H.R. 1836, the Guard 
and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act. 
As a member of the Army Reserve, I 
know the critical role that reservists 
and members of the National Guard 
play in defending our great Nation. Un-
fortunately, I also know firsthand that 
sometimes unique skills and experi-
ences the guardsmen and reservists 
bring to the table have been discounted 
or underutilized. That has always both-
ered me, as I personally know of the 
expertise that exists in our Guard and 
Reserve and their capabilities. 
Great strides have been made to 
value the Reserve and Guard like we 
value Active Duty, and we have come a 
long way and we need to continue that 
work. At the same time, I also know 
that Active Duty requires a level of 
commitment that does differ from the 
Guard and Reserve. Unfortunately, this 
bill has significant problems that pre-
vent me from supporting it, which 
could have been worked out in the 
committee process had there been a 
full legislative hearing on it. And that 
is why I say I stand to discuss this bill 
because this is the first opportunity I 
have really had to discuss it. 
H.R. 1836 would provide guard and re-
servists with Active-Duty service cred-
it towards GI Bill eligibility for every 
day they are in uniform, on Federal or-
ders, including training. So this is a 
status that has never been counted to-
wards educational benefits. 
Now, as cochair of the Congressional 
Bipartisan Burn Pits Caucus, the com-
mittee’s highest priority this Congress 
has been working to address the health 
effects that toxic exposures in the mili-
tary, including from burn pits. I am 
very concerned that the substantial 
spending in this bill could pull away 
from those efforts to address toxic ex-
posure in this tight fiscal environment. 
I also have concerns that this legisla-
tion might continue a slow creep of a 
permanent Federalizing of the National 
Guard, which was never the intent. We 
must be mindful not to usurp State au-
thority of the Guard. What I do believe 
would be appropriate, however, would 
be to allow guardsmen and reservists 
to accrue GI Bill eligibility for any 
time spent on Federal Active-Duty 
service other than training, as many in 
this body that serve here in Congress 
have done as Guard and Reserve. 
I was called to Active Duty for 15 
months; 12 months in Iraq. That should 
count. And that is a discussion we 
should have had, and what actually 
should maybe count and what should 
not because I think there is common 
ground. But we haven’t had a chance to 
discuss it. There is just the bill. Rep-
resentative MOORE has offered a sub-
stitute amendment which would do ex-
actly that, and I hope my colleagues 
will support that amendment, like I do. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the bill as offered and to instead 
support Representative MOORE’s sub-
stitute amendment. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, there are 
plenty of instances where training time 
and readiness training has counted to-
wards the GI Bill. We talk about the 
basic 
training 
that 
reservists 
and 
Guard unit members go through. That 
has counted toward the GI Bill. And if 
there is a worry about the Federaliza-
tion, Federal dollars already pay for 
the training days that we are seeking 
for the Guard unit members and the re-
servists to get credit for. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MRVAN),

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H54 
January 12, 2022 
my good friend, member of the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and 
the Chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Technology and Modernization. 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor today to rise in support of H.R. 
1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill 
Parity Act. I am so grateful for the 
sacrifices and the services of all our 
National Guard and Reserve members. 
They stand ready at a moment’s notice 
to protect our Nation, our democracy, 
and the health of our communities. 
Two instances jump out at me when 
I think of the heroism of the Indiana 
National Guard members from this 
past year. The first was being able to 
spend time with our brave National 
Guard members last year in the cafe-
teria of the Department of Labor on 
the other side of the Capitol complex 
when they bravely rushed to our Na-
tion’s Capitol to defend our Constitu-
tion and to protect our democracy. 
The second was when I was able to 
stand side by side with them in the 
city of Gary when they operated a Fed-
eral COVID–19 vaccine site, which pro-
vided over 60,000 vaccines in Northwest 
Indiana at a critical time during our 
pandemic. 
The First District is also home to the 
proud Slovak community. And I am 
particularly appreciative that the Indi-
ana National Guard has a flourishing 
military partnership with our strong 
ally, the country of Slovakia. We also 
have the 113th Engineering National 
Guard, which I have shared time with, 
who the men and women have sac-
rificed their time, dedication, and ef-
forts to go over to Afghanistan. What 
this bill does is it gives us the oppor-
tunity to have equitable training and 
equitable educational opportunity for 
our National Guardsmen. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation today has 
the opportunity to treat their Active 
Duty service on par with all branches 
of the military and ensure that every 
day the National Guard Reserve mem-
ber serves our Nation in uniform is a 
day that counts toward their GI Bill 
benefits. 
Thank you to the leadership of Con-
gressman 
MIKE
LEVIN, 
Chairman 
TAKANO, and all of my fellow members 
of the Committee on Veteran Affairs 
for your commitment to our Guard and 
Reserve members and for bringing this 
measure to the floor today. 
I also thank Chairman TAKANO on his 
leadership to protect the National 
Guardsmen on the burn pits and the 
toxic fumes that we have passed and 
how we are providing benefits and 
making sure that that is distributed 
fairly and equitably and making sure 
they receive the benefits necessary. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this important legislation. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes the gentleman from Michigan 
(Mr. BERGMAN), a man who has truly 
experienced what it is to serve, the 
highest ranking officer that serves in 
this body today. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. BOST for yielding me the time. I 
am always proud to stand on this floor 
and talk about the men and women 
who serve our country. And it is our 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition 
today to H.R. 1836, the Guard and Re-
serve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021. And it 
kind of saddens me that I have to rise 
in opposition because while this bill, 
well-intentioned, is unfortunately po-
tentially prone to unintended con-
sequences on the overall readiness of 
our Armed Forces, Active Reserve and 
Guard. But first I must note that these 
issues could have been brought to light 
earlier had this piece of legislation 
gone through regular order, received 
proper consideration across all the nor-
mal things that we historically have 
done. It received no legislative hear-
ings, foregoing the opportunity to re-
ceive input from key stakeholders, vet-
eran service organizations, new com-
mittee members on both sides of the 
aisle, and even the Biden administra-
tion. 
Without that engagement, we are 
just left with a bill that in its current 
form, which would count guard and re-
servists Federal Active-Duty service 
days towards GI eligibility, including 
for training. And there is a very subtle 
difference. In fact, it is a very exact 
difference in law between Active Duty 
for training and Active Duty. 
I spent much of my 40-year Marine 
Corps career in the Reserve component. 
And in fact, a little known part of my 
bio, my first 2 years off of Active Duty 
in the Marine Corps, I spent 2 years as 
a member of the Rhode Island National 
Guard. So not only Active component, 
Reserve component, but also a guards-
man as well. 
And my final assignment for 41⁄2 
years, I had the blessing and the oppor-
tunity to command the Marine Corps 
Reserve, roughly 100,000 folks in 183 
sites across the country at a time when 
we are deploying them at never-before- 
seen rates. 
I will always stand by the unwaver-
ing service and sacrifice given by the 
men and women in the Reserve compo-
nent and the National Guard. 
b 1315 
This bill, however, may unintention-
ally become an obstacle to the recruit-
ment and retention efforts of our Ac-
tive component military. We are in a 
time, and have been for over 40 years, 
of an all-recruited force on all levels. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, even as 
Governors offer non-GI Bill education 
benefits to their Guard, the parity with 
Active-Duty Forces that this bill is 
seeking for the Guard and Reserves, 
again, could impact our Active-Duty 
military, which we need to be ready at 
all times, considering today’s global 
threats. 
Today, more than 4 years after my 
colleagues and I passed into law an un-
precedented GI Bill expansion to allow 
any veteran to use these GI Bill bene-
fits without restriction of time, so they 
are good to go for as long as they live, 
I still believe there are many ways we 
can work responsibly to expand these 
benefits. 
For these reasons, I will be voting in 
favor of my friend and colleague Mr. 
MOORE’s benefit expansion amendment 
to ensure guard and reservists accrue 
GI Bill eligibility during any and all 
Federal Active-Duty days that are not 
training days. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the bill and support the Moore 
amendment. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 131⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Illinois has 14 minutes remaining. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR), a member of the com-
mittee who also serves as the chair of 
our Subcommittee on Energy and 
Water Development, and Related Agen-
cies in Appropriations. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1836, the 
Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act. 
I thank Chairman TAKANO and Rep-
resentative LEVIN for their important 
work on this legislation that finally 
acknowledges the undervalued service 
of our guard and reservists. The spon-
sors’ sentiments ring true: Every day 
in uniform counts. At least it should 
count. It should count more. 
In Ohio, there are over 11,400 Na-
tional Guard members performing stra-
tegic and operational duties to whom 
we owe enormous gratitude. 
Our National Guard protects our 
homeland and supports the mission of 
our troops abroad. It provides critical 
support to people in times of urgent 
need, from natural disasters to the 
public health COVID emergency we are 
in right now. 
The National Guard and Reserves 
have been an invaluable readiness re-
source throughout the COVID–19 pan-
demic and are continuing to fill crit-
ical roles in response to the pandemic. 
In my home State of Ohio, the Ohio 
National Guard has helped Ohio food 
banks distribute over 56 million pounds 
of food at 14 food banks and ware-
houses, including the Toledo North-
western Ohio Food Bank. They have 
provided food banks the support they 
needed to keep children, seniors, vet-
erans, and families fed during these 
very trying times. 
They set up COVID–19 testing clinics 
and traveled the State to keep our 
communities safe. They are currently 
stationed at 12 testing locations across 
Ohio. 
Thanks to President Biden’s execu-
tive actions, 2,300 Guard members have 
been activated across Ohio to help hos-
pitals and public health experts care 
for those most in need so all the omi-
cron variant patients that are flooding

our hospitals have some hope of sur-
vival. 
The service and dedication of our Na-
tional Guard and Reserves require that 
we appropriately recognize and appre-
ciate their sacrifices. While the debt 
we owe them cannot be fully repaid, 
the legislation before us ensures that 
these honorable men and women will 
receive the proper access to the edu-
cational benefits they so rightly de-
serve. 
Providing these important GI Bill 
benefits will undoubtedly aid the re-
cruitment and retention of National 
Guard units at home and abroad while 
further investing in our servicemem-
bers’ futures. 
With six National Guard sites in my 
own congressional district and several 
Reserve units nearby, I know that this 
legislation will have a deep and lasting 
impact on our State’s residents and 
those who answer the call to serve. 
It is certainly my privilege to rep-
resent these guard and reservists in 
Congress, and I am proud to support 
enhancing the benefits that they can 
have access to and deserve for their 
service. May God be with all our men 
and women in uniform. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just to clear up some 
statements that I think were made by 
some of the people while talking, it 
was brought up that we actually have 
already dealt with toxic exposures, and 
we haven’t. It is vitally important to 
understand that. 
Those costs that we are still going to 
be looking at, whether it is 300 or 150 or 
whatever it is, we haven’t found that 
out or figured that out yet. It is vitally 
important to understand that it is still 
out there, and there is going to be a 
cost. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH), 
someone from our side of the aisle who 
does a great job and that we trust tre-
mendously to watch our costs and 
watch our spending. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the ranking member from Illi-
nois for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, before we vote on new 
legislation, it is very important that 
we have an honest look at the price 
tag. As Republican leader of the House 
Budget Committee, it is my responsi-
bility to track how new spending im-
pacts our Nation’s bottom line. 
Every time Washington passes un-
paid-for legislation that adds a new 
benefit or program, or expands an ex-
isting one, our fiscal problems get 
much worse. At each one of these mo-
ments, we take another step toward ei-
ther raising taxes on middle- and low- 
income working-class Americans or 
asking China for another IOU. 
Look no further than the $2 trillion 
Biden bailout bill that was passed back 
in March. It added trillions to our Na-
tion’s debt. 
Also, the $5 trillion BBB that was 
passed out of this House would add tril-
lions to our debt. According to the 
Congressional Budget Office, which is 
the official scorekeeper for Congress, 
the true cost of the bill before us is 
hidden. The true cost before us is hid-
den. Why? 
On paper, the bill appears paid for. 
However, the new spending does not 
begin until 2025, and then the expan-
sion of benefits does not go into effect 
until after the budget window in 2032. 
Meanwhile, the pay-fors all go away 
within the 10-year window. This is a 
creative way for Democrats to use 
budget gimmicks and delay program 
start dates to push through billions in 
unpaid-for spending. 
These types of budget gimmicks are 
exactly what Democrats have been 
doing with the $5 trillion spending bill 
that was called out and why Senators 
on the other side of the building will 
not support the legislation. 
Congress must stop kidding itself 
with fanciful accounting. Stop pre-
tending that creating and expanding 
government programs, especially man-
datory spending programs, won’t come 
with a real fiscal impact. Start being 
honest with the American people about 
the true price tag and the consequences 
of their reckless actions. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, there has 
been an honest reckoning and an hon-
est assessment by the CBO, and this 
bill is paid for according to the rules, 
the same rules that my Republican 
counterparts observe. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN), a 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, where he is chairman of the 
Oversight 
and 
Investigations 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. I rise today in support 
of this legislation because the Guard 
and Reserve deserve parity. They have 
been there for us, and we must be there 
for them. 
When natural disasters beset the land 
and there are wildfires on the West 
Coast, they are there. When hurricanes 
ravage the Gulf Coast, they are there. 
When tornadic activities are within all 
the midsection of the country, they are 
there. They have been there for us, and 
we must be there for them. 
They do leave their families, just as 
the 
Active-Duty 
servicepersons 
do. 
Yes, they leave their children. They 
leave their wives. They leave newborns. 
They come to severe and protect us, 
just as they did after the assault on the 
Capitol. 
They were here to prevent democracy 
from being eroded. They were here to 
protect the President and the Vice 
President. They have been here for us, 
and we must be there for them. 
They have been there when many of 
us had no other hope other than to 
have them show up to defend us. 
I remember Katrina. I remember 
what was happening in New Orleans. I 
went down there. I saw the National 
Guard come in. I saw them protect and 
defend. 
We have a duty and an obligation to 
them, and this is our opportunity to 
fulfill it. 
Mr. Chairman, I thank you for what 
you are doing today for a multiplicity 
of reasons, one being that I don’t want 
to see what happened to the Merchant 
Marine happen to the National Guard 
and the Reserve. It took them 44 years 
to get GI benefits. We cannot allow 
this to happen. 
Mr. Speaker, I am there, I am here, 
and I will be there for them. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the 
debate with many others, and so many 
times it is being misunderstood that 
the Guard and Reserve don’t receive 
these benefits when they are called up 
on Federal—they actually do on many 
of the Federal orders. The Moore 
amendment would allow that to occur. 
I think many of our Members are 
confused on what they actually are re-
ceiving time for toward their GI Bill. I 
want to express again what we are say-
ing is that the overreach here that oc-
curs is that one weekend a month, 2 
weeks a year, they know when they 
sign up that that is the difference. It is 
not going to be credited. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. BOWMAN), my good friend 
who serves on the Education and Labor 
Committee 
with 
myself 
and 
the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is our 
responsibility to ensure that our vet-
erans have the resources they need to 
access care after serving. 
Every year, brave men and women 
enlist in the military, seeking to serve 
their country, pursue a better life, and 
obtain benefits and security for their 
future. This means being able to afford 
college and having access to housing, 
healthcare, and other opportunities. 
Our troops are deployed into active 
war zones that too often leave veterans 
with PTSD, suicidal ideation, anxiety, 
addiction, depression, and other mental 
health challenges. 
Regardless of what congressional dis-
trict you live in, you will always take 
what happens in your service back 
home with you. 
b 1330 
But when they return, our govern-
ment has failed to provide them with 
the care and support they deserve. 
The outcome is a veterans suicide 
crisis. The suicide rate for veterans is 
1.5 times higher than the rate of non-
veteran adults, and I see this in my dis-
trict. I have had veterans call my office 
as a last resort after not being able to 
access the healthcare they need at the 
VA. My constituent services team has 
had multiple cases of veterans strug-
gling with suicidal ideation and other 
mental health challenges who have ex-
pressed an immense frustration that no

H56 
January 12, 2022 
one in our government seems to care 
about their well-being. Our veterans 
deserve better, and we must do better. 
I am grateful for incredible organiza-
tions in my district like Black Vet-
erans for Social Justice, Veterans for 
Peace, and The American Legion who 
are leading with care, working to sup-
port our veterans’ mental health by 
destigmatizing mental health care and 
connecting veterans to mental health 
professionals. They regularly host sup-
port groups for veterans with mental 
health 
challenges, 
advocate 
for 
a 
stronger VA system, and provide one- 
on-one opportunities for veterans to 
learn about benefits available to them. 
Our amendment to H.R. 1836 builds 
upon their work to ensure that when 
transitioning to civilian life, veterans 
receive 
information 
about 
what 
healthcare and mental healthcare serv-
ices are available to them, including 
how to access the Veterans Crisis Line 
and seek mental health support. This 
amendment also specifies that this in-
formation should be provided to vet-
erans 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
helps 
destigmatize mental health and en-
courages veterans to reach out. 
These are important steps toward 
creating a society in which every sin-
gle veteran has access to universal, 
high-quality healthcare and is empow-
ered to seek out the mental health sup-
port they need to thrive. 
If you are a veteran who is struggling 
with mental health challenges, please 
know that you are not alone and that 
seeking out mental health support is 
an important step toward feeling bet-
ter. During these especially difficult 
times, we must care for ourselves and 
for one another. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
esteemed honor and privilege to yield 1 
minute to a champion and staunch ad-
vocate who is unparalleled in her sup-
port for our Nation’s 22 million vet-
erans. This Congress with her support 
we have continued to preserve the sa-
cred trust of our men and women in 
uniform and the 200,000 servicemembers 
who become veterans each year. 
Mr. Speaker, of course, I am referring 
to the Speaker of this great House 
from the great State of California, my 
own State. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI). 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his leadership in 
bringing this important legislation to 
the floor and for yielding. 
We owe our veterans everything. 
They make us the home of the brave 
and the land of the free. They protect 
our democracy. They and their families 
make us so very, very proud. 
I thank the gentleman again, Mr. 
TAKANO, as chair of the committee, and 
Mr. LEVIN for his leadership on this 
particular legislation which I will ac-
knowledge in a moment. 
First, Mr. Speaker, I want to say, 
nearly eight decades ago when Con-
gress enacted the first GI Bill, our Na-
tion made a bipartisan and unbreak-
able promise: that every hero who 
steps forward to defend our Nation de-
serves the tools to succeed when they 
come home. Today, the House will 
proudly take another strong step to-
ward fulfilling that pledge. 
On behalf of the Congress, I commend 
the outstanding leadership of the com-
mittee chair, MARK TAKANO, who has 
ensured that the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee remains committed to its 
long legacy of bipartisanship. I salute 
the chair of the Veterans’ Affairs Sub-
committee on Economic Opportunity, 
Congressman MIKE LEVIN of California, 
both for leading on this important leg-
islation every step of the way and for 
his lifetime advocacy on behalf of our 
military communities. 
Every time our Nation seeks to 
strengthen and expand benefits for vet-
erans, we have listened closely to our 
men and women in uniform and our 
veterans, taking their insight and ex-
pertise into account. We continue to 
listen to them today as we continue to 
build upon our progress and appro-
priately honor their service. 
On a regular basis we have a meeting 
with our veterans service organiza-
tions. The American Legion is very 
much a part of that, as well as other 
groups reflecting our involvement in 
other wars since World War II, and we 
still have a few veterans from then. 
What is interesting about this legis-
lation today to me is that, again, it 
sprang from listening to our men and 
women in uniform and our veterans as 
to what their needs are. That is exactly 
how the first GI Bill came to be. 
The veterans of World War I, recog-
nizing the disadvantages that they 
were at after World War I, came forth 
with the proposal to have the GI Bill. 
So this was passed and signed by 
Franklin Roosevelt during World War 
II at the suggestion of veterans of 
World War I. 
During the dark days of the Second 
World War and after listening to the 
calls of the brave veterans of World 
War I, President Roosevelt made clear 
the urgent moral imperative of sup-
porting our returning soldiers. 
In a message to Congress in Novem-
ber 1943, he said, 
‘‘The members of the Armed Forces 
have been compelled to make greater 
economic sacrifice and every other 
kind of sacrifice than the rest of us, 
and they are entitled to definite action 
to help take care of their special prob-
lems.’’ 
I am very proud that my father, 
Thomas 
D’Alesandro, 
was 
in 
this 
Chamber. He was a Member of Congress 
from Baltimore when the President 
said that. His brother would be lost 
shortly thereafter in the battle leading 
up to the Battle of the Bulge. 
Less than a year later, Congress en-
acted the first GI Bill on an over-
whelmingly bipartisan vote marking a 
turning point in how our Nation cares 
for our veterans. In doing so, we made 
a transformational investment in our 
servicemembers, opening the doors to a 
college education and home ownership, 
launching millions of families into the 
middle class. 
In 2008 it was my great privilege to 
serve as Speaker as the Congress took 
a crucial step to bring these benefits 
into the 21st century. With the Post-9/ 
11 GI Bill—passed on a strong bipar-
tisan vote and signed into law by Presi-
dent George W. Bush—we expanded the 
promise of a full, 4-year college edu-
cation to veterans in Iraq and Afghani-
stan, and we ensured subsequent legis-
lation that their families could also 
take advantage of that benefit. In 2017 
we strengthened this law by improving 
benefits and closing gaps in eligibility 
so that we can best serve those who 
served our Nation. 
Yet, today, too many veterans still 
do not receive equal access to the life- 
changing benefits they have earned. 
Over the last few decades, our valiant 
reservists and guardsmen have become 
even more integral to America’s na-
tional security strategy. Our reservists 
often serve side by side with Active- 
Duty servicemembers, do the same 
jobs, and incur the same risks. And as 
our Nation has battled the pandemic, 
our communities have relied on our 
guardsmen to help protect our Nation 
from the deadly virus. 
These heroes are essential to keeping 
our families and our Nation safe, but 
current law falls short of delivering the 
benefits they deserve. With the Guard 
and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, we will 
ensure that every day our reservists 
and guardsmen heroes serve in uniform 
count toward their GI benefits. In 
doing so, we will lift up hundreds of 
thousands of current and future vet-
erans across the Nation so that they, 
too, will have the opportunities they 
need to thrive in the 21st century econ-
omy. 
Let me be clear: ensuring every serv-
icemember has equal access to hard- 
earned benefits is an issue of fairness. 
When the House passes this legislation 
today, we will build on the proud, bi-
partisan progress forged by generations 
of lawmakers in this Chamber and in 
the Senate as well, we show our heroes 
that they will always have our unwav-
ering support, and we honor the sac-
rifice on the battlefield. The military 
vows that on the battlefield we will 
leave no soldier behind, and when they 
come home, we pledge that we will 
leave no veteran behind. 
There is so much more that we can 
learn from listening to our veterans 
and our servicemembers that we must 
do, so that they can take their strong-
est position when they come home. 
Mr. Speaker, in this all-American 
spirit, I urge a very strong ‘‘aye’’ vote 
for this legislation. 
I want to thank the distinguished 
chairman for his leadership and MIKE 
LEVIN for his relentless persistence for 
the benefit of our veterans as a mem-
ber of that important committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H57 
January 12, 2022 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I think 
Members of the House need to under-
stand because many speakers, includ-
ing the previous speaker, brought up 
the fact that those who serve should 
receive these benefits who actually 
serve on the battlefield. When they do, 
they do. Under this existing system 
right now they receive that benefit. 
What we are talking about now is an 
expansion to those days of reservist, 
the weekend a month and the 2 weeks 
a year. It is completely different from 
the fact when they are on Federal or-
ders, and the Moore amendment would 
actually deal with that and take care 
of that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, it is 
an honor to be here today to offer this 
MTR. 
If we adopt the motion to recommit, 
we will instruct the House Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs to consider an 
amendment to H.R. 1836 which ensures 
members of the Armed Forces granted 
a general discharge under honorable 
conditions 
solely 
for 
refusing 
the 
COVID–19 vaccine are eligible for the 
GI Bill education benefits of which the 
Speaker just spoke about. 
Mr. Speaker, I therefore ask unani-
mous consent to include the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, on 
August 24, 2021, the Secretary of De-
fense issued a directive requiring man-
datory COVID–19 vaccination for all 
servicemembers, including those in the 
Ready Reserve and the National Guard. 
Despite the challenges this vaccine 
mandate currently faces in the Su-
preme Court, the Defense Department 
has proceeded to discharge those who 
refuse the vaccine. 
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, 
marines, and guardians have already 
been discharged, and as many as 20,000 
servicemembers remain at risk over 
being involuntarily removed from serv-
ice. It is outrageous. 
To prevent those who have refused 
the vaccine from being dishonorably 
discharged, Congress included a provi-
sion in the fiscal year 2022 National De-
fense Authorization Act limiting dis-
charges for failure to receive the 
COVID–19 vaccine to either an honor-
able discharge or a general discharge 
under honorable conditions. 
This change succeeded in stopping 
further disciplinary action or court- 
martial for those who refuse the vac-
cine, however it potentially leaves 
many veterans in limbo between leav-
ing the service with full benefits or 
having 
their 
education 
benefits 
stripped as they walk out the door. 
As many of my veteran colleagues in 
this Chamber know, those servicemem-
bers who receive a general discharge 
under honorable conditions are ineli-
gible for the Montgomery and Post-9/11 
GI Bill benefits due to restrictions Con-
gress implemented in 2011. 
While this change was intended to 
open eligibility status to members of 
the National Guard, there will now be 
a group of veterans who have served 
honorably up until the point of refus-
ing COVID–19 vaccine who will now 
have their education benefits com-
pletely wiped out. 
For those who may not know the full 
breadth of education benefits entitled 
to a veteran, let me give you just a 
couple of items. A veteran who was 
served at least 36 months on Active 
Duty is entitled to 100 percent of Post- 
9/11 GI benefits. That includes full tui-
tion coverage for public schools, or 
roughly $26,000 annually for private 
education or apprenticeships. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman from Wisconsin an addi-
tional 2 minutes. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. That veteran also 
receives a monthly housing allowance 
which varies by location, plus $1,000 an-
nually to cover books and other school 
supplies. Add that up, and we are talk-
ing about well over $100,000 worth of 
education benefits a veteran loses sim-
ply by having their discharge charac-
terized as general under honorable. 
b 1345 
And let’s be clear on who this is truly 
affecting, Mr. Speaker. We are not 
talking about recruits who are fresh 
out of basic training or those dis-
charged at the MEPS station. These 
are men and women who have done 
their time, who have paid their dues, 
and who have served with distinction 
up until the point of refusing this vac-
cine. 
And now we are going to tell them 
that we don’t care how spotless their 
record may have been beforehand be-
cause they made a moral, ethical and 
even religious objection to a vaccine? 
Those who have fought to defend our 
country should not be deprived of the 
benefits they so rightly deserve simply 
for refusing to comply with this divi-
sive, and potentially unlawful, vaccine 
mandate. 
My motion to recommit corrects this 
disparity by ensuring any member of 
the armed services who receives a gen-
eral discharge under honorable condi-
tions solely for the refusal of the 
COVID–19 vaccine is entitled to edu-
cation benefits. 
We are a country that rewards our 
heroes, not punishes them, and this 
motion to recommit makes sure of 
that. I urge the adoption of this motion 
to recommit. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The issue of how servicemembers are 
disciplined for refusing to take the vac-
cine has already been addressed in the 
National Defense Authorization Act. It 
already states plainly that there could 
be a general discharge, or an other- 
than-honorable discharge, or an honor-
able discharge. So there is, it seems to 
me, an irrelevance or it is unnecessary, 
this proposed MTR. So we already have 
a solution that has been agreed to in 
the Armed Services space and jurisdic-
tion. 
That being said, I do not have any 
further speakers, I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I am ready to close, but there are a 
few things in the closing that I want to 
be sure and bring up. 
First off, the GI Bill cannot be in-
cluded in—was not included, and those 
benefits would be removed if they 
refuse to take the vaccine. So the MTR 
is actually a legitimate motion that is 
something that we do need to deal with 
that was not taken care of in that bill. 
And just so you know, a vitally im-
portant issue that was brought up by 
General Bergman, our speakers that we 
have had here today, they don’t take 
this lightly. They are very serious 
about this. They have served them-
selves. They have served in these ca-
pacities. They understand the concern. 
And the concern of retention in the Ac-
tive Forces is a serious concern. 
We just received notice that the 
Army raised its max bonus for new re-
cruits to $50,000 due to struggling in 
trying to get people to come on to Ac-
tive Reserve. By offering this benefit 
above and beyond that has been a con-
cern of many of those that have ex-
pressed that concern. 
But let me tell you this on this de-
bate today. I want to thank Chairman 
TAKANO and others for a thoughtful and 
respectful debate, which is vitally im-
portant on an issue like this. 
I also want to thank Congressman 
LEVIN. His passion on these issues was 
truly present as well, and we under-
stand that. 
You know, I am a former marine. I 
am a former active marine. I am a ma-
rine because, you know, once you are a 
marine you are always a marine. That 
is vitally important to remember. And 
as a father of a marine and a grand-
father of a marine, these issues are per-
sonal to me. 
Now, I understand the sacrifices that 
members of our National Guard make 
every day. And I think some of the 
things that were spoken of here today 
confuse the fact that when they get 
called up to Active Duty, go over to 
Iraq, go to Afghanistan, those qualify 
towards their GI bill. It does. And I am 
not opposed to them receiving edu-
cation benefits, nor was anybody that 
spoke here today. 
But the Guard and Reserve is that; it 
is a Guard and Reserve. And whenever 
they are activated, yes, they should re-
ceive those benefits. That is why the 
Moore amendment is so vitally impor-
tant that we are going to be talking on

later as well. If we adopt that, it will 
cover everything except that compo-
nent that those Guard and Reserve 
members knew when they joined, that 
they didn’t get those benefits for that 
1 weekend a month and those 2 weeks a 
year. 
And why is that? Because it is a sepa-
rate standing than an Active-Duty 
military personnel. 
This discussion—and I know we all 
want to respect our Guard and Reserve, 
but this is not the way to do it. Doing 
it in the right order, hearing from ev-
eryone in committee, discussing these 
issues, bringing them up, and getting 
input from those stakeholders that are 
involved, was the proper way to do 
this; not to do it here on the floor in 
this manner. 
I think the debate has been really 
good. I hope that the people that are 
listening understand. I hope that our 
colleagues understand what it is; that 
a vote against this is not a vote 
against the Guard and Reserve. A vote 
against this is simply saying, no, there 
is another way that is more fiscally re-
sponsible, that will still offer benefits 
and reward those for their service. But 
this is not the right way. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill, ‘‘yes’’ on 
the amendments that we are coming up 
with, but ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I will, in closing, say that the minor-
ity has not raised a substantive argu-
ment, a serious argument against the 
substance of this bill. This is a good, 
good piece of legislation, one that is 
agreed to and supported by numerous 
veterans service organizations. 
To the issue of and to the objection 
raised by the minority over a lack of 
process and a lack of regular order, 
this is simply not true. We have had 
ample opportunity for the minority to 
have input in numerous hearings re-
lated to this topic. 
And as to the concern over recruit-
ment and retention of our Active-Duty 
Forces, I will remind my esteemed 
ranking member, or the esteemed 
ranking member, for whom I have 
great admiration for his own service 
and the service of his family in the 
military, that we turned to the Guard 
and Reserve in greater and greater de-
pendence in the post-9/11 era. And be-
cause we were able to turn to them, we 
did not have to have discussions about 
a draft. 
We had issues recruiting folks for our 
military in the early aughts to the 
numbers that we needed, and we had to 
turn to the Reserve and the Guard. So 
we need good incentives and great re-
tention incentives for our Guard units 
and our Reserve units all across this 
country because we aren’t going to de-
pend on them less. In fact, we are going 
to depend on them more. 
And the tempo of the training, all we 
are saying is that the readiness train-
ing they undergo is no less than the 
readiness training of our Active-Duty 
troops. Regardless of whether they 
knew or didn’t know at the beginning 
when they signed up as reservists or 
guardsmen, they deserve to have every 
day count. 
Now is the time for Congress and this 
House to say that every day of readi-
ness training should count toward GI 
bill eligibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in support of the bipartisan 
amendment that I have put forward, along with 
my colleagues DEBORAH
ROSS, JENNIFFER 
GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N, and JAMAAL BOWMAN. 
As my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle have made clear, our Nation owes a tre-
mendous debt to our veterans. 
I am pleased that this week, the House will 
take up a bill to help improve access to serv-
ices and benefits that our men and women in 
uniform have earned. 
H.R. 1836—the National Guard and Re-
serve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021—would allow 
Members of the National Guard and Reserves 
to count time spend in training towards their 
Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. 
I am so proud of the men and women in 
Wisconsin’s National Guard who have mobi-
lized throughout our nation’s history in support 
of overseas combat operations in places like 
Iraq, Afghanistan, during both world wars, the 
Spanish-American War, and the Civil War and 
are now engaged in their longest ever domes-
tic mobilization, to combat COVID–19. 
They are a key part of our communities and 
to efforts to protect and defend our nation. 
Our amendment to this bill simply attempts 
to help ensure that the VA take every oppor-
tunity to ensure that new veterans who are 
leaving or about to transition from active duty 
are aware of the VA benefits they may be eli-
gible for, including critical health care services. 
Unfortunately, too many vets leave the mili-
tary without knowing what they are eligible for 
at the VA or do not have the documentation 
they need to prove their eligibility. As a result, 
they can find themselves missing out on crit-
ical benefits and services they need or trying 
to navigate bureaucratic red tape, without suc-
cess, to try and find the right answers. These 
men and women answered the call to serve 
their country and it is our responsibility to 
honor the debt our Nation owes them for their 
service. 
We can do better. And that must start with 
providing as much information as early as 
possible to those who could be eligible for VA 
benefits or services. 
Our amendment requires the VA to inform 
new veterans of the medical care and services 
for which they are eligible, including commu-
nity care; mental healthcare, care relating to 
military sexual trauma; and any other informa-
tion the Secretary deems appropriate. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment and the underlying bill. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of H.R. 1836, the Guard and 
Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, which will expand 
eligibility for post-9/11 G.I. Bill educational 
benefits to members of the National Guard 
and the Reserves. 
Current law defines the term ‘‘active duty’’ 
as those individuals who are on full-time duty 
in the active military service of the United 
States, including full-time training duty, annual 
training duty, and attendance, while in the ac-
tive military service, at a school designated as 
a service school by law or by the Secretary of 
the military department concerned. 
H.R. 1836, will expand eligibility criteria to 
include those training in full-time National 
Guard duty, which includes the National 
Guard, the Army National Guard, and the Air 
National Guard, as well as those same mem-
bers when performing active duty. 
Under current rules, service members need 
three years on active-duty to be eligible for full 
Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which include 36 
months of in-state college tuition, a monthly 
living stipend and other payouts. 
Reaching that amount of time mobilized to 
active-duty is difficult for guardsmen and re-
servists, and outdated and confusing eligibility 
requirements means the difference of tens of 
thousands of dollars for college for those indi-
viduals. 
For example, the deployment of thousands 
of Guard troops to Capitol Hill following the 
January 6 attack counted towards GI Bill eligi-
bility, because the mission was being paid for 
with federal funds. 
However, troops mobilized for crowd control 
during racial equality protests in Washington, 
D.C., last summer were not able to count that 
time, because those missions weren’t funded 
by federal dollars. 
Some other riot response missions across 
the nation were funded by federal funds, and 
did count towards the education benefits. 
Similarly, tens of thousands of Guard and 
Reserve troops have been mobilized for pan-
demic response missions over the last two 
years, but their eligibility varies depending on 
the specific orders and units involved. 
For years, members of the National Guard 
and Reserve Components have been dis-
advantaged and overlooked in the accumula-
tion of their education benefits while per-
forming the same or similar service as their 
Active-Duty counterparts. 
Time and time again, through natural disas-
ters, global pandemics, and threats to our de-
mocracy, our National Guard and Reserve 
members have answered the call to serve. 
But despite taking on the same risks and 
doing the same jobs as their active-duty coun-
terparts, these service members don’t have 
access to the same benefits. 
This has become much clearer and more 
severe during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Members of the National Guard and Re-
serve Component have risked their lives on 
the front lines of this pandemic, administering 
aid and protecting the Capitol on training sta-
tus. 
Our brave men and women continue to self-
lessly answer our nation’s call and are long 
overdue the benefits befitting their service. 
The Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 
2021 will ensure the men and women of the 
National Guard are entitled to GI Bill education 
benefits when activated for service either for 
training or for operational needs of our coun-
try, just like their Active- Duty counterparts. 
I want to thank all of our armed serviceman 
and women for their selfless dedication to our 
protection every day. 
In my home state of Texas, the National 
Guard has been deployed time and time again 
to assist citizens and save lives during numer-
ous natural disasters, including the Winter

Freeze of last February and the tragic Hurri-
cane Harvey. 
The Texas National Guard is host to nearly 
21,000 troops, including its army and air com-
ponents. 
The National Guard is a diverse force that 
includes all ethnicities: 
White: 69 percent; 
Black: 15 percent; 
Hispanic: 10 percent; 
Asian: 3 percent; 
Male: 83.1 percent; 
Female: 16.9 percent 
This bill, in which we further the benefits 
and recognition that our servicemen and 
women deserve, also reminds us that we have 
an overriding duty to protect the health and 
dignity of those serving today. 
For this reason, I would like to discuss the 
crisis that our National Guardsmen and 
Guardswomen have been thrust into at the 
Texas Governor’s direction on our Southern 
Border. 
In 
March 
2021, 
the 
Texas 
Governor 
launched the ill-fated and ineffective Operation 
Lone Star which he claimed was necessary to 
stem a so-called invasion of migrants at 
Texas’ southern border. 
As of November 2021, more than 10,000 
Texas National Guardsmen have been de-
ployed to the southern border in pursuit of this 
folly. 
According to published media accounts, Na-
tional Guard members who have been acti-
vated for Operation Lone Star are experi-
encing habitual pay delays and poor working 
conditions during the border mission, including 
being exposed to COVID–19, and many are 
missing the equipment necessary for safety 
and mission success. 
In addition, the National Guard has faced 
austere conditions and limited resources, lead-
ing to unsanitary conditions such as the lack 
of portable restrooms. 
Rather than addressing these conditions, 
just last week the Texas Governor filed a frivo-
lous lawsuit in federal court challenging the 
authority of President Biden, the Commander- 
in-Chief of the Armed Forces to require that 
members of the National Guard be vaccinated 
against COVID–19. 
There is no merit to this nuisance law suit 
as demonstrated by the summary rejection of 
similar arguments raised by neighboring Okla-
homa Governor Stitt. 
The Texas Governor’s failure to comply with 
the policies intended to reduce the spread of 
COVID–19 among the Armed Forces will 
mean that there will be less military personnel 
available national disasters that have struck 
Texas in recent years, such as the winter 
freeze of last year. 
This will also mean that there are fewer per-
sonnel to respond to any attacks on the home-
land. 
Encouraged by the Texas Governor’s obsti-
nacy, about 40 percent of the members of the 
Texas Army National Guard are refusing to 
get vaccinated, which puts at risk their col-
leagues and the persons they are sworn to 
defend and protect. 
National Guardsmen and Guardswomen de-
ployed in this disastrous mission at the Texas 
Governor’s insistence face the deadly spread 
of COVID–19, unsanitary conditions, lack of 
pay, and a lack of a certain future. 
These uniformed men and women deserve 
better, and some of them, seeing no alter-
native to their present reality, have decided to 
end it all. 
Five National guard soldiers have shot and 
killed themselves in the past three months, 
and one more survived a suicide attempt. 
One of these men, private first class Joshua 
R. Cortez, was preparing to accept a ‘‘lifetime 
job’’ with one of the nation’s biggest health in-
surance companies in late October last year, 
but the Texas National Guard had other ideas. 
Operation Lone Star required involuntary ac-
tivations to meet the Texas Governor’s troop 
quotas, and Cortez was one of the soldiers 
tapped to go on state active duty orders—with 
no idea how long the mission would last. 
In November, the 21-year-old mechanic re-
quested a hardship release from the mission: 
‘‘I’ve been waiting for this job and I’m on my 
way to getting hired . . . I missed my first op-
portunity in September when I had to go on 
the flood mission in Louisiana. . . . I can not 
miss this opportunity because it is my last op-
portunity for this lifetime job.’’ 
Cortez’s 
company 
commander 
rec-
ommended approval. But his battalion com-
mander and brigade commander disapproved. 
Within 36 hours of his request being denied, 
Cortez drove to a parking lot in northwest San 
Antonio and shot himself in the head. 
Three other soldiers tied to Operation Lone 
Star have died by suicide, including: 
Sgt. Jose L. De Hoyos was found dead in 
Laredo, Texas, on Oct. 26. He was a member 
of the 949th Brigade Support Battalion’s head-
quarters company. 
1st Sgt. John ‘‘Kenny’’ Crutcher died Nov. 
12, as time ran out on his temporary hardship 
waiver. He was the top NCO for B Company, 
3rd Battalion, 144th Infantry. 
1st Lt. Charles Williams, a platoon leader in 
Crutcher’s company, died at home overnight 
Dec. 17 while on pass. 
The string of suicides raises urgent ques-
tions about the mission’s conditions and pur-
pose, as well as the way it’s organized and 
manned through indefinite involuntary call-ups. 
This is an excellent and common-sense bill 
that will enhance the benefits of our service-
men and women. 
We must also act to ensure that our service-
men and women are protected from COVID– 
19, both for their own safety and the safety of 
our nation. 
When called to action, the National Guard 
performs the name duties as our active duty 
forces, oftentimes in extraordinarily difficult sit-
uations. 
Although we cannot bring back the lives lost 
due to the Texas Governor’s misguided ac-
tions, we can remember the names of those 
we have lost and work to ensure that we treat 
all members of our military equally and with 
dignity and respect.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS. ROSS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
225. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end the following new section: 
SEC. 4. PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO VET-
ERANS DURING TRANSITION TO CI-
VILIAN LIFE. 
(a) REQUIREMENT.—In providing informa-
tion to new veterans regarding benefits ad-
ministered by the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs, the Secretary shall ensure that the in-
formation includes the following: 
(1) A description of the medical care and 
services for which the veteran will be eligi-
ble under chapter 17 of title 38, United States 
Code, including with respect to— 
(A) community care under section 1703 of 
such title; 
(B) mental health care, including how to 
access the Veterans Crisis Line established 
under section 1720F(h) of such title; and 
(C) care relating to military sexual trauma 
(as defined in section 1166 of such title). 
(2) Any other information that the Sec-
retary determines appropriate, including in-
formation about the services and benefits to 
which the veteran may be entitled. 
(b) MANNER.—The Secretary shall provide 
the information under subsection (a) in a 
manner that promotes the destigmatization 
of mental health care and encourages vet-
erans to reach out for support. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 860, the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ROSS) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge sup-
port for my bipartisan amendment, 
which will require the VA to notify 
transitioning servicemembers of the 
services for which they are personally 
eligible. 
Notification must include informa-
tion about mental healthcare, commu-
nity care under the MISSION Act, and 
care related to military sexual trauma. 
Troubling reports have found that 
many transitioning veterans are not 
aware of the health benefits available 
to them through the VA. A recent De-
partment of Defense Office of the In-
spector General report found that the 
DOD has failed to provide proper men-
tal health screening and care for 
transitioning veterans; in part, because 
so many veterans do not understand 
what care is available to them. 
The transition away from active 
service can be a tumultuous time dur-
ing which many new veterans face 
mental health issues. Left unaddressed, 
these issues can be debilitating and 
deadly. 
My father served as a psychiatrist in 
the Air Force during the Vietnam era. 
He witnessed firsthand the need for 
proper and timely mental healthcare 
among veterans. But mental health re-
sources at the VA can only be helpful 
to those who know of their existence.

January 12, 2022 
We owe a debt of gratitude to our 
veterans, and they deserve gold-stand-
ard and seamless access to the benefits 
that they have earned. 
My amendment will help new vet-
erans understand and access the care 
to which they are entitled. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, Congressman BOW-
MAN, and Congresswoman MOORE for 
joining me in offering this amendment. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I claim time 
in opposition to the amendment, al-
though I am not opposed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, Congress-
woman ROSS’ amendment would re-
quire VA to share information regard-
ing 
mental 
healthcare, 
community 
care, and other services to veterans 
who have recently transitioned out of 
the military. 
Leaving the military can be a dif-
ficult and vulnerable time for many 
veterans. It is critical that separating 
servicemembers 
receive 
support 
as 
they restart their civilian lives. Part of 
that is ensuring that they are educated 
and empowered to take advantage of 
the benefits they earned by serving the 
Nation in uniform. 
Now, right now, the education occurs 
primarily through the Transition As-
sistance Program, or TAP. TAP was 
created in 1990, and always includes in-
formation on the VA care, benefits and 
services that those transitioning out of 
the military may be eligible for. 
Now, TAP is a great program, and it 
is vitally important because those of us 
who are older veterans, the only tap we 
got was on the shoulder and a hey, 
good to see you; have a great life. But 
now TAP actually has that oppor-
tunity. 
In addition, the Trump administra-
tion began the Solid Start program in 
2019. Through Solid Start, all new vet-
erans are contacted by the VA three 
times during their first year out of uni-
form. Those contacts occur 90, 180, and 
360 days after separation from service 
and are a priceless opportunity for 
newly separated servicemembers to 
connect with the VA. 
b 1400 
Congresswoman 
ROSS’ 
amendment 
would require that the VA provide in-
formation to those new veterans, in-
cluding 
information 
regarding 
the 
healthcare, including mental health, 
community care, military sexual trau-
ma, and the Veterans Crisis Line. 
As I indicated, the VA already pro-
vides new veterans with information 
during TAP and through the Solid 
Start program. This amendment sim-
ply ensures that the materials VA pro-
vides to new veterans specifically in-
cludes these subjects. 
For that reason, I am in support of 
her amendment, and I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support that. I thank 
Congresswoman ROSS and the cospon-
sors of this amendment for their work, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his support. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO), the chairman of Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Ross, Gonza´lez-Colo´n, 
Moore, and Bowman amendment, and I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, there is no way bet-
ter way to connect veterans with med-
ical care and services than first mak-
ing sure that they are aware of the 
care that they have earned with their 
service. 
The Ross amendment makes sure 
that VA informs our veterans of this 
care they have earned just as they are 
entering civilian life. 
The first months are crucial in a vet-
eran’s transition out of the military, 
and the Ross amendment ensures that 
veterans are aware of what kind of care 
and support they can access and how 
they can access it. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
the Ross amendment. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment will help new veterans un-
derstand the specific benefits that they 
have 
and 
that 
they 
have 
earned 
through their service. I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of my amend-
ment, the bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

HOULAHAN). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 860, the previous question is or-

Federal Active-Duty orders for service 
other than for training. 
As a former member of the National 
Guard, I know all too well the chal-
lenges that they face. The National 
Guard has transitioned in recent years 
from a reserve force for domestic mis-
sions to a full-time force operating 
around the globe. 
My amendment would remove the 
Presidential declaration requirement 
that has restricted benefits for so 
many members of the National Guard 
in the past. It would make it so that 
members of the National Guard would 
receive eligibility for the time spent 
under any Federal Active-Duty orders 
that are not for training. 
This would provide eligibility for 
Federal benefits to those who support 
COVID–19 relief, respond to natural dis-
asters, and protect our southern bor-
der. 
I agree with Chairman LEVIN that we 
must take a hard look at duty status 
reform and the expansion of benefits 
afforded to the National Guard and the 
Reserve component while operating 
under Federal Active-Duty orders. 
My amendment would make it clear 
that if you are called up on Federal or-
ders for something other than training, 
you should receive eligibility for GI 
Bill benefits. 
However, I am concerned that the ex-
pansion proposed in his bill is a little 
too broad. We should allow the DOD to 
complete their efforts to better align 
benefits to certain duty statuses before 
we move forward with such a broad ex-
pansion. I think General Bergman hit 
on that point today, that we need to 
give them time to work through the 
process. 
An expansion of every day in uniform 
could cost over $2 billion over the next

10 years in mandatory benefits, where 
my expansion is only $16 million. 
We talked about inflation in the 
hearing today. We have seen the high-
est increase in 40 years. I think we 
need to try to get a handle on this kind 
of runaway spending. I think my ap-
proach is more surgical, if you will. It 
allows the benefits to our Guard and 
servicemembers without just painting 
a broad brush for everyone in uniform. 
My amendment ensures that mem-
bers of the National Guard that are 
called to action receive access to edu-
cational programs, like all other vet-
erans, while doing so in a fiscally re-
sponsible manner. 
Finally, I would like to thank Rank-
ing Member BOST and all his staff for 
their support on this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
claim time in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to take a moment to high-
light for the sponsor of this amend-
ment, Representative MOORE, and all 
Members, 
just 
how 
severely 
this 
amendment 
would 
harm 
National 
Guard and reservists from their States 
and districts. 
Congressman MOORE represents the 
great State of Alabama. Despite being 
the 24th most populous State in the 
Union, Alabama has the 12th largest 
National Guard in the Nation by num-
ber of servicemembers. Among the 
units in the Alabama National Guard 
that the Moore amendment would 
shortchange by eliminating training 
days—and I say training days are also 
readiness days—is the Alabama 20th 
Special Forces Group. 
Members from this group, and units 
like it, must complete roughly 2 full 
years of training, from basic training 
to completion of the arduous and high-
ly competitive Special Forces Quali-
fication Course, just to be qualified as 
Special Forces Green Berets. 
In order to maintain a high level of 
readiness and be ready to deploy when 
our Nation calls on them, these serv-
icemembers must constantly attend 
additional training to maintain certifi-
cations and proficiencies critical to 
their jobs as reservists. 
To be clear, this training is con-
ducted at Active-Duty schools right 
alongside their Active-Duty counter-
parts, yet guard and reservists don’t re-
ceive the same credit for the days they 
are in uniform, despite maintaining the 
exact same readiness requirements. 
Readiness matters. Consider this: In 
2013, reservists spent 87,000 days on 
title 32 orders, which is how the Re-
serve Force assists with floods, hurri-
canes, and other significant events. 
However, in 2021, that number had 
grown to 9.5 million days. 
This amendment would continue to 
uphold this unequal policy and prevent 
members of the Alabama 20th Group 
from accruing days of service for train-
ing. Training is another word for readi-
ness. 
Some States and servicemembers 
from units like Alabama’s 20th Group 
carry a heavier burden, but this exam-
ple is not unique to Alabama. All 
across the country, Guard and Reserve 
members from every State put their ci-
vilian lives on hold in defense of our 
Nation. They give much of themselves, 
their sweat, blood, and sometimes even 
the 
ultimate 
sacrifice 
in 
service. 
Whether during training or deploy-
ment, they deserve the same benefits 
for their days in service. They have 
earned it. 
Finally, I would also note that the 
Moore 
amendment 
uses 
the 
same 
IRRRL rate change found in H.R. 1836, 
which we agree is a fair update to the 
IRRRL program. 
Let’s be clear: A vote for this amend-
ment is a direct statement to our 
Guard and Reserve servicemembers 
that you don’t think their days in serv-
ice are equal to those of their Active 
Duty counterparts. 
Representative MOORE served in the 
National Guard, and I thank and com-
mend him for that service. Now, I know 
that he is a humble man, like most of 
our servicemembers, but I think his 
days in service should be honored and 
given their due credit. I know he may 
have participated in ROTC, but if his 
education wasn’t fully paid for by that 
program, then I think he should be 
given credit for his National Guard 
service for GI Bill eligibility. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Representa-
tive MOORE to reconsider his submis-
sion of this amendment, and I urge all 
Members to oppose the Moore amend-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), the 
ranking member of the Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support 
of 
Congressman 
MOORE’s 
amendment to H.R. 1836, as amended, 
the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity 
Act of 2021. 
While I do not support the underlying 
text of the bill, I believe that Congress-
man MOORE’s amendment, of which I 
am a cosponsor, would make impor-
tant, commonsense changes to it. 
The underlying bill would make a 
vast and costly expansion of benefits to 
Guard and Reserve members to include 
GI Bill eligibility for every day in uni-
form under Federal orders. This in-
cludes GI Bill eligibility for weekend 
drills and training. 
As I stated during the general debate 
earlier, I believe that this bill’s $2 bil-
lion mandatory cost is using rare off-
sets that take away from the priorities 
this committee has in serving our Na-
tion’s veterans. That is why today I 
stand 
in 
support 
of 
Congressman 
MOORE’s amendment. 
These substituted provisions would 
simplify current law so that any time 
spent on Federal Active Duty by mem-
bers of the Guard and Reserve for serv-
ice other than for training would count 
toward GI Bill eligibility. This would 
include service in support of protecting 
the southern border, federally funded 
missions in support of efforts to com-
bat COVID–19, and other critical Active 
Duty missions. 
The amendment would only require 
$16 million in mandatory offsets, com-
pared to the $2 billion the underlying 
bill would cost. 
Not only is this policy change good 
for our Nation’s veterans, but it also 
does not burden our children, grand-
children, and future generations of 
American taxpayers with tens of bil-
lions of dollars over several decades in 
unfunded offset costs like the under-
lying bill would. 
This is without question a more 
measurable and fiscally responsible ap-
proach to more fully honor the valu-
able service that these men and women 
of the Guard and Reserve perform. 
I want to thank Congressman MOORE 
for his hard work on the amendment. 
Before yielding back, I would like to 
say that if a person votes against this 
bill, it is not a vote against the Guard 
and Reserve. It is a vote for the tax-
payers, which Guard and Reserves are 
also taxpayers. It is the reason why we 
should have had a more full debate on 
this bill in committee so these things 
could have been brought up. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 11⁄4 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, let me just say 
there is nothing commonsense about 
this amendment. Injustice to our re-
servists and our Guard units is not 
common sense. Unfairness to our guard 
and reservists is not common sense. 
To say that this is a fiscal burden to 
our Nation, who depends on our guard 
and reservists in natural disasters and 
who our Nation will rely on even more 
in the future, that is not common 
sense. 
Madam Speaker, it is time to make 
every day of readiness training that 
our reservists and our Guard unit 
members perform count toward their 
GI Bill eligibility. 
The GI Bill, as Speaker PELOSI has 
said, did amazing things for this Na-
tion in the post-World War II era. That 
same amazing contribution of our re-
servists and our guardsmen will con-
tinue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to vote against this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 860, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. MOORE).

which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
today the Committee on Rules met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 868, 
providing for consideration of the Sen-
ate amendment to H.R. 5746. 
The rule makes in order a motion of-
fered by the chair of the Committee on 
House Administration or her designee 
that the House concur in the Senate 
amendment with an amendment con-
sisting of the text of the Freedom to 
Vote, John R. Lewis Act. The rule pro-
vides 1 hour of debate on the motion 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on House Administra-
tion or their designees. 
Madam Speaker, this is about more 
than a bill, and it is about more than a 
process. This is a rescue mission to 
save American democracy. Because 
right now, we are in the midst of the 
most significant period of voter sup-
pression in recent history. 
All across the country, in service to 
a lie started by the former President 
and spread by some in this very body, 
State legislatures are moving to make 
it harder for people to cast their ballot. 
Polling places are being closed so the 
nearest location is now miles and miles 
away. Early voting times are being 
slashed during this global pandemic, so 
it is now too unsafe for some people to 
vote. Purges of voting rolls, including 
faulty voter purges, are becoming more 
likely and more common. And strict 
voter ID laws are being used to dis-
enfranchise more and more people from 
casting their ballots. 
Madam Speaker, in one State, it has 
even become illegal to provide voters 
waiting in line with food and water. 
That is why we are here today, because 
some believe that the only way for 
them to win is to rig an election. This 
is voter nullification pure and simple. 
Now, many on the other side want us 
to turn a blind eye to all of this, just 
like they turned a blind eye to the in-
surrection 
and 
the 
creeping 
authoritarianism. Well, I am not will-
ing to look away. People fought and 
died for the freedom to vote in this 
country. We served with someone who 
nearly gave his life for the right to 
vote—Congressman John Lewis. 
He was beaten by mobs using base-
ball bats and chains, attacked by racist 
members of the KKK, and even thrown 
in jail. But still, still he fought for the 
freedom to vote. If he was willing to 
withstand all that to do what is right, 
then certainly we can cast a vote to de-
fend our democracy. 
John once said, ‘‘Change often takes 
time. It rarely happens all at once. In 
the movement, we didn’t know how 
history would play itself out. When we 
were getting arrested or waiting in jail 
or standing in unmovable lines on the 
courthouse steps, we didn’t know what 
would happen, but we knew it had to 
happen.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know what 
will happen in the Senate, but I know 
that this vote has to happen, because 
the freedom to vote is under assault. 
We have a system today that under-
mines the civil rights of the young, the 
poor, and those who don’t look like me. 
It is a system that has allowed Presi-
dents to win elections despite losing 
the popular vote. It is a system that 
has allowed politicians to gerrymander 
their way into office. And it is a sys-
tem that gives the 26 least popular 
States, representing just 17 percent of 
the country, the chance to derail legis-
lation that the vast majority of Ameri-
cans support. 
Madam Speaker, that is the reality 
of the Senate filibuster. And make no 
mistake, despite the claims by some, 
the filibuster is not sacrosanct. It has 
been changed over 161 times in the last 
five decades. And nowhere—nowhere— 
does it appear in the Constitution of 
the United States. 
Just recently, a bipartisan group of 
Senators came together to advance a 
filibuster carveout to raise the debt 
ceiling. Now, I am glad that they did. 
That was the right thing to do. A de-
fault would have been catastrophic for 
our economy. Certainly, allowing a 
carveout for voting rights is also the 
right thing to do. 
We need to pass the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act to ensure that every 
American has the ability to make their 
voice and vote heard in our democracy. 
And I wish we could get a majority of 
Republicans to support voting rights. 
You know, they used to. The Voting 
Rights Act was reauthorized four times 
with overwhelming bipartisan support, 
including in 2006 under the Presidency 
of Republican George W. Bush. 
But something has changed. This 
isn’t your grandfather’s Republican 
Party anymore. It is a party defined by 
the big lie, wild conspiracy theories, 
and winning elections by trying to sup-
press the vote. To set a standard that 
we must act on this bill or that the 
Senate should act on filibuster reform 
only if Republicans come along is a 
fool’s errand. 
Madam Speaker, on what planet are 
the people causing the problem going 
to help solve it? 
Now, I would rather be on the side of 
John Lewis than cast my lot with the 
big lie. I would rather go it alone to de-
fend our democracy than do nothing 
together. And yes, I would rather lose 
an election than win by rigging the 
outcome. This fight may not be new 
but it has never been more urgent. 
Madam Speaker, history is watching. 
And this moment is bigger than any of 
us. With the future of our democracy in 
the balance, I pray that my colleagues 
join me in saying the same and sup-
porting this rule and the underlying 
measure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and I thank the Representative 
from Massachusetts for yielding me the 
customary 30 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, today we were in-
formed by the majority at the last 
minute that we would be brought in to 
discuss the NASA Enhanced Use Leas-
ing Extension Act of 2021, which was 
amended by the Senate and will be 
amended yet again here in the House, if 
this rule passes. 
I don’t think anyone here is surprised 
by yet another last-minute meeting, 
but I am starting to feel the effects 
from all of the whiplash over the last 
year. This time, House Democrats seek 
to insert the Freedom to Vote Act and 
the Voting Rights Advancement Act as 
a last-ditch effort to cater to the Sen-
ate majority’s sporadic attempts to get 
something passed for their radical 
base, even though we all know neither 
of these bills will pass through the Sen-
ate. 
House Democrats and Senator SCHU-
MER still need bipartisan support for 
this partisan bill. And certain other 
Senators in their party have yet to 
cede to the fringe of their party and go 
nuclear on a longstanding Senate prin-
ciple, the filibuster. Whatever the 
thought process behind this effort to-
night, it is disappointing that it is yet 
another deeply partisan attempt to 
Federalize all elections. 
Madam Speaker, the Constitution 
places the responsibility for elections 
at the State level and has a long his-
tory of letting each State run their 
own elections. But H.R. 4, a component 
of this bill, would grant the Federal 
Government 
unprecedented 
control 
over State and local elections. It would 
empower the Attorney General to bully 
States and force them to seek Federal 
approval before making changes to 
their own voting laws. 
Madam Speaker, this is an assault on 
the rights of States and local govern-
ments to manage their own elections. 
The right to vote is one of our most 
fundamental rights as citizens. It is up-
setting to see the majority take advan-
tage of this important issue because 
they are so desperate to maintain their 
power. This can be seen almost explic-
itly in the Freedom to Vote Act, which 
includes a new campaign finance provi-
sion that would ensure certain can-
didates receive millions of dollars in 
public funding for running a campaign. 
The majority does not discuss this 
provision very often, but do the Amer-
ican people really want public dollars 
to go to fund campaigns? 
State oversight in elections is impor-
tant. Like so many things, the major-
ity fails to recognize what works best 
for one State is not necessarily going 
to work in another State or across the

country. States know what practices 
work best for their voters, as they have 
done throughout history. It was not 
hard to find many flaws in this bill, 
and I was able to do so with less than 
an hour’s time. But I remained dis-
appointed in the priorities and prac-
tices of this majority. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 2140 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
today is my birthday, and I could not 
think of a better gift for the American 
people. 
In the last 24 hours, we found that 
five States—Republicans—decided to 
put in false certifications to determine 
that Trump actually won the Novem-
ber 2020 election. In a bill in Texas that 
was passed after the big lie, they al-
lowed the legislature to overturn a 
duly held election. 
Do you not think there is a siege on 
the rightful vote of Americans no mat-
ter who they are, of people of color and 
young people? 
I am so happy that we decided to 
move forward on the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act that will stop the 
detrimental 
gerrymandering 
that 
wants to eliminate Members of color. 
It is time now that the relic of the 
filibuster no longer promotes discrimi-
nation and racism but frankly that we 
move on protecting democracy, on cra-
dling democracy, on recognizing that 
we are patriots who stand to support 
the idea of the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I support this rule 
because the Constitution rules and the 
American people deserve the right to 
vote. 
Madam Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary 
Subcommittee on Crime, Homeland Security, 
and Terrorism, and a senior member of the 
Homeland Security, and Budget Committees, I 
rise in strong support of the rule governing de-
bate for the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, 
the ‘‘Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.’’ 
We are here tonight because we must act, 
and this legislation provides the tools to ad-
dress discriminatory practices and seeks to 
protect all Americans’ right to vote. 
On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the 
Capitol, President Johnson addressed the na-
tion before signing the Voting Rights Act— 
considered the most effective civil rights stat-
ute ever enacted by Congress: 
‘‘The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever devised by man for breaking down injus-
tice and destroying the terrible walls which im-
prison men because they are different from 
other men.’’ 
This bill is the result of tireless work and 
compromise by my colleagues in the House 
and my colleagues in the Senate. 
The signing of the Voting Rights Act came 
after, in that same year, in Selma, Alabama, 
hundreds of heroic souls risked their lives for 
freedom and to secure the right to vote for all 
Americans by their participation in marches for 
voting rights on ‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ ‘‘Turn-
around Tuesday,’’ or the final, completed 
march from Selma to Montgomery. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, brave and 
determined men and women, boys and girls, 
persons of all races and creeds, loved their 
country so much that they were willing to risk 
their lives to make it better, to bring it even 
closer to its founding ideals. 
The foot soldiers marched because they be-
lieved that all persons have dignity and the 
right to equal treatment under the law, and in 
the making of the laws, which is the funda-
mental essence of the right to vote. 
On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more 
than 600 civil rights demonstrators, including 
our beloved former colleague, the late Con-
gressman John Lewis of Georgia, were bru-
tally attacked by state and local police at the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from 
Selma to Montgomery in support of the right to 
vote. 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ was a defining moment in 
American history because it crystallized for the 
nation the necessity of enacting a strong and 
effective federal law to protect the right to vote 
of every American. 
However, since the enactment of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, the right to vote has been 
under constant assault. 
The Voting Rights Act was enacted at a 
time when many African Americans in south-
ern states had been denied the right to vote, 
and when attempting to register, organize, or 
even assist others in their attempt to register 
to vote meant risking their jobs, homes, and 
racial violence. 
Prior to the enactment of the VRA, litigation 
initiated under the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 
and 1960 failed to eliminate discrimination in 
voting because jurisdictions simply shifted to 
different tactics in order to disenfranchise Afri-
can Americans. 
Nearly fifty-seven years later, we face an-
other turning point in the life of the nation and 
for the dignity of men and women and the 
destiny of democracy. 
Although the Supreme Court has described 
the right to vote as the one right that is pre-
servative of all others, this ‘‘powerful instru-
ment that can break down the walls of injus-
tice’’ faces grave threats. 
The threat stems from the decision issued in 
June 2013 by the Supreme Court in Shelby 
County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which 
invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and para-
lyzed the application of the VRA’s Section 5 
preclearance requirements. 
According to the Supreme Court majority, 
the reason for striking down Section 4(b) was 
that ‘‘times change.’’ 
Now, the Court was right; times have 
changed. 
But what the Court did not fully appreciate 
is that the positive changes it cited are due al-
most entirely to the existence and vigorous 
enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, and that 
is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed. 
As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in 
Shelby County v. Holder, ‘‘[t]hrowing out 
preclearance when it has worked and is con-
tinuing to work to stop discriminatory changes 
is like throwing away your umbrella in a rain-
storm because you are not getting wet.’’ 
The current Supreme Court majority has 
simply never understood, or refuses to accept, 
the fundamental importance of the right to 
vote, free of discriminatory hurdles and obsta-
cles. 
In fact, were it not for the 24th Amendment, 
I venture to say that this conservative majority 
on the Court would subject poll taxes and lit-
eracy tests to the review standard enunciated 
in Brnovich v. DNC. 
Protecting voting rights and combating voter 
suppression schemes are two of the critical 
challenges facing our great democracy. 
Without safeguards to ensure that all citi-
zens have equal access to the polls, more in-
justices are likely to occur and the voices of 
millions silenced. 
And this is exactly what we have seen over 
this past year. 
The polarization of Americans is ever in-
creasing, as seen during the 2020 election 
through tactics meant to impede the right of 
certain Americans to vote, such as the re-
moval of mailboxes and the closing of postal 
stations in order to impede mail-in voting. 
After the former president was soundly de-
feated at the ballot box in what experts unani-
mously proclaim was the most secure election 
in history, still the former president and his 
cronies propagated the Big Lie that the elec-
tion was illegitimate because it was rife with 
fraud. 
The former president persisted in this spe-
cious claim even though, despite ample oppor-
tunities to do so, they produced not a scintilla 
of evidence to persuade any of the 61 state 
and federal courts that entertained the claims. 
But to this has been added reactionary state 
laws passed or introduced to suppress, 
abridge, restrict, or deny the right to vote of 
millions of eligible Americans, particularly per-
sons of color, young persons and persons with 
disabilities, and working parents, precisely the 
constellation of persons whose votes deter-
mined the outcome of the 2020 presidential 
election. 
In the aftermath of the 2020 election, ac-
cording to the Brennan Center For Justice, be-
tween January 1 and July 14, 2021, at least 
18 states enacted 30 laws that restrict access 
to the vote, some making mail voting and 
early voting more difficult, others imposing 
harsher voter ID requirements, and making 
faulty voter purges more likely. 
In total, more than 400 bills with provisions 
that restrict voting access have been intro-
duced in 49 states in the 2021 legislative ses-
sions. 
My home state of Texas is ground zero for 
this desperate effort to hold back an American 
future led by the ascendant coalition of young, 
racially diverse and all other tolerant, imagina-
tive, and innovative voters who became ener-
gized and inspired by Barack Obama in 2008 
and the belief in a new and just America. 
To combat not their ideas but instead their 
increasing numbers, the Republican legislature 
and Governor of Texas passed and signed 
into law SB1, which: 
Bans drive-thru voting, 24-hour voting, and 
the distribution of mailin ballot applications; 
imposes new and extraneous ID require-
ments for voting by mail; 
authorizing ‘‘free movement’’ to partisan poll 
watchers, effectively turning them into vote 
suppression vigilantes; 
requires monthly checks of voting rolls to fa-
cilitate purging unwanted voters; and 
imposes onerous new rules for voter assist-
ance. 
All of this is more than enough to sound the 
warning bell that we are now engaged, as 
President Lincoln observed at Gettysburg, in a

great contest testing the proposition that this 
nation, or any nation conceived in liberty and 
dedicated to the proposition that all men and 
women are created equal, can long endure. 
This is the present crisis in which we find 
ourselves and it indeed is soul trying. 
But as Thomas Paine wrote on Christmas 
Eve in 1776: 
‘‘The summer soldier and the sunshine pa-
triot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service 
of their country; but he that stands by it now, 
deserves the love and thanks of man and 
woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily con-
quered; yet we have this consolation with us, 
that the harder the conflict, the more glorious 
the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we 
esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that 
gives everything its value.’’ 
The work for civil rights and voting rights in-
volved tens of thousands of individuals who 
fought to correct the course of the nation by 
setting it on a path of equal rights and justice 
for all. 
The efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King, Ralph 
Abernathy, Andrew Young, Hosea Williams, 
Coretta Scott King, and John Robert Lewis, 
among others, as well as the thousands of 
foot soldiers in the civil rights movement suc-
ceeded in waking the nation to the idea that 
change was needed. 
The result of their work was the establish-
ment of protections that allowed voters of 
every race, creed, color, and political belief to 
cast ballots free of interference or threat. 
The blood spilled during these difficult times 
is not forgotten by the communities that saw 
and experienced these battles, which is why 
laws like Texas SB1 cannot go unanswered 
by the United States House of Representa-
tives and Senate. 
To meet the challenge we have been called 
upon to face and overcome, what is needed is 
for men and women of courage, conscience, 
and conviction to step forward and come to 
the aid of their country by passing the Free-
dom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act to strengthen 
the foundation of our democracy upon which 
all else depends, including the important nec-
essary investments to Build Back Better and 
mitigate the effects of Climate Change. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor 
of this rule governing debate of Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I am 
prevented by House rules from using 
the profanity that I would like to be-
cause I stand here absolutely outraged. 
I am outraged because the Democrats 
have outdone themselves with this lie. 
I am outraged because the Democrats 
have made a mockery of bipartisan col-
laboration for cheap political gain. I 
am outraged because Democrats have 
not an ounce of respect for this institu-
tion or the rules or the consequences of 
their actions in this Chamber. 
A few hours ago, H.R. 5746 was the 
NASA Enhanced Use Leasing Exten-
sion Act, a simple three-page bill that 
was good for NASA, good for our space 
industry, and good for our taxpayers, a 
bill that I was very proud to cosponsor. 
Now, in the dark of night, this bill 
has been hijacked and mutilated to be-
come the latest iteration of the Demo-
crats’ Federal takeover of our election 
system—a wolf in sheep’s clothing. In 
fact, the only thing left from this origi-
nal bill is its number. 
What is worse, I can’t even remove 
my name as a cosponsor. Isn’t it ironic 
that the same bill the Democrats are 
using as a vehicle to steal elections in 
perpetuity was itself stolen? I can’t say 
that I am surprised. Just like with 
elections, if they can’t do it legally, 
Democrats will find a way to hijack 
and steal it—all of this from the party 
who claims Republicans are the ob-
structionists. Give me a break. 
Madam Speaker, I demand that my 
name be removed from this Trojan 
horse, and I urge every single one of 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair cannot entertain the gentleman’s 
request. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am not going to be lectured about re-
spect for this institution by anybody 
who after a violent attack against this 
Capitol, the people who work here, this 
democracy—after 
a 
violent 
attack, 
them then coming to this House floor 
and voting to overturn, to nullify the 
will of the American people with no 
basis of fact at all to do that. I will not 
be lectured by anybody who would do 
such a thing. Quite frankly, I think it 
is unconscionable. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), the distinguished Speaker of 
the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, the distinguished chair of the 
Rules Committee, for his leadership in 
bringing this important legislation to 
the floor tonight to enable us to fight 
for voting rights tomorrow when we 
vote for the legislation. Many of us will 
have more to say tomorrow on the sub-
stance of that bill, but I just want to 
place this action in time. 
Today is a historic day because we 
are taking a big step forward thanks to 
the leadership of the distinguished ma-
jority leader in the Senate, CHUCK 
SCHUMER. We are in a position now to 
take a step forward with this rule to 
enable us to debate the bill tomorrow 
to fight for voting rights. 
Yesterday, President Biden made it 
crystal clear that the Senate must find 
a path forward to enshrine critical vot-
ing rights legislation into law. That 
was yesterday. 
Today, House Democrats will take 
another step to defend our democracy 
with legislation called the Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act. We will send 
it to the Senate for urgent consider-
ation after we debate it and vote on it 
tomorrow. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
JOHN SARBANES from Maryland. This is 
a bill that we have voted on in the last 
Congress but also in this Congress, in 
this House of Representatives. We 
voted for the For the People Act, which 
is the essence of the legislation we are 
considering now. It was H.R. 1 in the 
House. 
In addition to that, it is attached to 
H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, which will be 
part of this package tomorrow because 
of the leadership of CHUCK SCHUMER; 
JOHN SARBANES; ZOE LOFGREN; TERRI 
SEWELL, who has carried this legisla-
tion again and again; Mr. BUTTERFIELD; 
the distinguished chair of the Judici-
ary Committee, Mr. NADLER; and so 
many people. 
b 2150 
We have had this debate over and 
over again in the House and in this 
Congress, so when I hear people say, 
‘‘Oh, here comes a bill that has never 
seen the light of day,’’ no. We had a 
vote in the House on this already. We 
had a vote on this in the House al-
ready, and this is as it came back to us 
this time from the Senate. 
Yesterday, as I said, the President 
made it crystal clear that we had to 
get 
something 
done. 
Again, 
Mr. 
MCGOVERN
is giving us that oppor-
tunity now. So I just want to say that 
is why this is necessary. It has been 
said in the gentleman’s committee this 
evening—but let me just be brief be-
cause the night is getting on—since we 
passed the bill before, and in the course 
of the year, the Republicans have con-
tinued their assault on voting rights in 
our country. 
Nearly 400 bills were introduced, 20 of 
them enacted into law, which not only 
suppressed the vote, making it harder 
for people of color and people with dis-
abilities—people—to vote, but also leg-
islation to nullify the vote. 
It doesn’t matter how the people 
vote; it matters how the people we ap-
point decide how they vote. That is not 
a democracy. It strikes to the heart of 
a democracy. 
It strikes to the heart of a democ-
racy, and that is why this legislation is 
even more necessary than when it was 
first introduced. It is a continuation in 
legislatures across the country of the 
assault that was made on this Capitol 
to undermine the Constitution, the 
Capitol, the Congress, and our democ-
racy on January 6. 
As the distinguished gentleman from 
Massachusetts mentioned earlier, there 
was not even a vote to accept on the 
part of many on the other side of the 
aisle the results of that election. I 
thank Mr. MCGOVERN not only for his 
leadership tonight but for that dan-
gerous day for him to take over the 
chair after the security spirited me out 
because of threats on my life. 
So, again, this is urgent. It is a re-
peat of what we have done and done 
again and again. We are glad that the 
Senate is ready to receive this next 
iteration with very little change from 
what we had passed before. 
In Georgia, when President Biden de-
livered a clarion call to defend our de-
mocracy, he said: ‘‘I will not yield. I 
will not flinch. I will defend your 
right,’’ he said to folks, ‘‘to vote and 
our democracy against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic. And so the question

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H68 
January 12, 2022 
is: Where will the institution of the 
United States Senate stand?’’ 
Well, we will see. We had the ques-
tion of the filibuster. Now, until we 
had this debate on this voting rights 
and filibuster has become a discussion, 
what was your view, Madam Speaker, 
of what that word meant? 
When somebody said they were going 
to filibuster something or they were 
engaged in a filibuster, you thought 
they were going to talk for a long time, 
to filibuster, to talk for a long time, 
not to obstruct justice, not to obstruct 
debate, not to obstruct the majority to 
be able to take a vote, to discuss some-
thing. 
By passing the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act, the Democratic 
House will make clear that we in this 
House stand with the President, yes, 
but with the American people to fight 
for voting rights. 
Nothing less is at stake than our de-
mocracy. The sanctity of the vote and 
the integrity of our elections is what is 
at stake. 
I thank all of our colleagues who par-
ticipated in this for their committed 
leadership for the people in the fight 
for voting rights. 
Madam Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Minnesota 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I am glad that it 
was brought up tonight, those who 
have served and been willing to give 
their lives for this country. 
If we are going to talk about num-
bers, let’s talk about the numbers in 
2020. More people voted in 2020 than 
ever in the history of this country be-
fore, yet we are talking about suppres-
sion. 
Well, under Democratic leadership, 
our 
country 
is 
breaking 
records: 
record-high inflation, record-high ille-
gal border crossings, historic levels of 
drug and human trafficking across the 
border, skyrocketing energy prices, 
surging crime rates, and countless 
empty shelves in grocery stores across 
the country. 
Americans are watching the dollar of 
their paycheck literally shrink before 
their eyes in real time as inflation 
spikes to the highest levels that we 
have seen in 40 years. 
The border is an absolute disaster. I 
was there last week. Illegal border 
crossings are, again, the highest ever, 
with close to 2 million illegal appre-
hensions 
under 
President 
Biden’s 
watch. Fentanyl has crossed our south-
ern border at levels that we have never 
seen before, and it is the leading killer 
of young adults in this country— 
100,000-plus lives in 2021. 
Instead of bolstering American en-
ergy security, the White House is 
spending their time lobbying for a Rus-
sian pipeline that will most certainly 
be used as a weapon against our allies 
in Eastern Europe. 
The policies of this administration 
and the Democratic Congress have led 
us into a record-breaking season of cri-
ses. But instead of working to fix these 
issues, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle are attempting to distract 
the American people. 
Do we really think that Americans 
aren’t paying attention? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Texas an ad-
ditional 30 seconds. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Tonight, Democrats 
are twisting the rules to pass a bill to 
nationalize our election system, allow-
ing for hard-earned taxpayer dollars to 
finance political campaigns and hand-
ing control of congressional district 
boundaries to the powers that be in 
Washington, requiring States to allow 
felons to vote, and overriding wildly 
popular voter ID laws. 
To reference the President’s dis-
appointing 
speech 
yesterday, 
sup-
porting voter ID or opposing this Wash-
ington power grab does not make you 
George Wallace or Jefferson Davis. 
That is nonsense. Americans deserve a 
President and a government that will 
lead us out of crises, not create them. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just remind my colleagues 
that voter suppression takes many 
forms. Sometimes it is Republican 
State legislatures making it more dif-
ficult for people to vote. Sometimes it 
is members of bodies like this that, on 
one hand, brag about the record turn-
out in the last election but have been 
working overtime to try to nullify and 
to try to disqualify the votes of the 
people of this country. It is stunning. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a July 2, 2021, U.S. News and 
World Report article titled ‘‘Report: 
Republican-Led 
State 
Legislatures 
Pass Dozens of Restrictive Voting 
Laws in 2021.’’ 
[From U.S. News, July 2, 2021] 
REPORT: REPUBLICAN-LED
STATE
LEGISLA-
TURES PASS DOZENS OF RESTRICTIVE VOTING 
LAWS IN 2021 
(By Horus Alas) 
STATES WITH REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURES HAVE 
PASSED
WAVES
OF
NEW
LAWS
MAKING
IT 
HARDER FOR CONSTITUENTS TO VOTE IN RE-
SPONSE TO THE 2020 ELECTION, EXPERTS SAY 
The Supreme Court issued a new ruling on 
Thursday that upheld two Arizona laws re-
stricting organizations’ ability to collect 
mail-in ballots as well as invalidating bal-
lots cast in the wrong precinct. Critics say 
the court’s decision further erodes landmark 
voting protections codified by the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
The court’s ruling follows a report finding 
that as of mid-June, 17 states had passed 28 
laws making it harder for constituents to 
vote in 2021, according to the Brennan Center 
for Justice at New York University’s School 
of Law. The report notes that the last year 
a similar number of laws passed restricting 
access to the ballot was 2011—when 14 states 
had enacted 19 such measures by October. 
Eliza Sweren-Becker, a voting rights and 
elections counsel at the Brennan Center, 
called the new wave of voting laws ‘‘an un-
precedented assault on voting rights’’ as well 
as ‘‘a voter suppression effort we haven’t 
seen since the likes of Jim Crow.’’ 
The nation’s high court previously gutted 
a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 
2013, when Chief Justice John Roberts wrote 
a majority opinion arguing that jurisdictions 
with a history of racial discrimination in 
voting should no longer be subject to over-
sight from the Department of Justice before 
effecting changes to their voting laws. 
The Brennan Center report attributes this 
year’s batch of restrictive voting laws to 
‘‘racist voter fraud allegations behind the 
Big Lie (a reference to former President 
Donald Trump’s repeated false claims of a 
rigged election) and a desire to prevent fu-
ture elections from achieving the historic 
turnout seen in 2020.’’ 
Commenting on the former president’s 
claims of mass voter fraud, Sweren-Becker 
says, ‘‘We know that’s false, but we have of-
ficials at the state level passing these laws 
making it harder for people to vote.’’ 
Some of the specific provisions in these 
laws that can have a negative impact on 
voter turnout according to the Brennan Cen-
ter include restrictions on voting by mail— 
some 63.9 million ballots had been sent as of 
Election Day 2020, data from the U.S. Elec-
tions Project indicated—challenges to in- 
person voting, and limitations on the num-
ber of mail ballot drop boxes in precincts. 
According to Sweren-Becker, Republican 
lawmakers in state legislatures across the 
country are capitalizing on Trump’s repeated 
claims of voter fraud to pass these measures. 
‘‘What is very clear is that we had a very 
successful election last year with historic 
turnout that was certified as one of the 
safest, most secure elections,’’ she says. 
‘‘And we are hearing (about claims of voter 
fraud) as pretextual motives .... These laws 
are being enacted in Republican-controlled 
legislatures, in many cases on purely party- 
line votes.’’ 
States differ in their structuring of these 
laws as well. 
The report specifically calls out Florida, 
Georgia and Iowa for passing comprehensive 
omnibus bills that ‘‘undertake a full-fledged 
assault on voting.’’ In contrast, certain 
states including Arkansas and Montana have 
passed piecemeal voting restrictions through 
four separate bills each. 
Sweren-Becker says advocates are consid-
ering two primary avenues to challenge some 
of these new voting laws: court litigation 
and federal voting reform legislation. 
‘‘Litigation is happening already, in states 
like Georgia, Iowa, Florida. But that is a 
piecemeal 
state-by-state 
approach,’’ 
she 
says. ‘‘And that’s why a federal policy like 
the For the People Act and the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Act are so necessary because 
they will be applicable to people across the 
country.’’ 
As of mid-June, Senate Democrats were 
still wrangling the necessary votes to pass 
either of these voting rights measures in the 
face of expected unified Republican opposi-
tion. 
But even as some states face litigation for 
measures they’ve passed, others still have 
active legislative sessions where observers 
worry that more voting restriction measures 
may follow. 
Sweren-Becker says voting rights advo-
cates should focus on pressuring state law-
makers in Pennsylvania—a state with a Re-
publican-controlled legislature that adjourns 
in December—and Texas, where a special ses-
sion will begin July 8, after Democrats 
walked out on a vote for a bill that would in-
crease vote by mail restrictions and limit 
early voting hours at the end of the regular 
session.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H69 
January 12, 2022 
Despite outcry from Democrats, Texas 
Gov. Greg Abbott has struck a defiant tone 
on his state’s omnibus voting measure, SB7. 
In response to a tweet from the Texas Attor-
ney General detailing the booking of a sus-
pect charged with voter fraud, Abbott wrote: 
‘‘Voter fraud is real and Texas will prosecute 
it whenever and wherever it happens. We will 
continue to make it easy to vote but hard to 
cheat.’’ 
Sweren-Becker says the frenetic pace of 
this year’s restrictive voting bills—the Bren-
nan Center’s report noted 61 bills with re-
strictive provisions continuing to move 
through 18 state legislatures as of June 21— 
makes it ‘‘essential to pass federal democ-
racy reform that ensures that people can 
freely and safely cast their ballots.’’ 
And while these bills’ language tends to 
omit race, Sweren-Becker says that several 
of their provisions do end up targeting access 
to the ballot for voters of color. 
She notes ‘‘the policy in the Texas bill 
that banned early voting hours during the 
Sunday before Election Day, which very 
clearly targets souls to the polls efforts that 
are clearly organized by Black churches,’’ as 
well as increased challenges to voting by 
mail, ‘‘after a wave of increased mail voting 
last year, and particularly by voters of color 
and young voters.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
one voting rights expert said in this 
piece that we are in the midst of ‘‘a 
voter suppression effort we haven’t 
seen since the likes of Jim Crow.’’ 
To suggest that this isn’t happening 
is to ignore reality. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this bill we got in 
short order tonight does not reflect the 
actual text, and once again, the Rules 
Committee had very short notice to 
consider the text without really any 
chance of being able to read it. Cer-
tainly, we are now on the floor with no 
chance to amend it. 
It is supposed to be a NASA-focused 
bill, but it is actually a Trojan horse, a 
Trojan horse the Democrats are using 
to drastically change election law and 
do it without any input from Repub-
licans, no input in the Rules Com-
mittee, no input here on the floor, and 
no chance to amend it in the House Ad-
ministration Committee. 
It is a messaging bill from Democrats 
to get a bill quickly passed in the Sen-
ate while they have an agreement. We 
saw how difficult their chaotic at-
tempts to pass Build Back Better be-
came and how that bill eventually 
failed. 
It is ridiculous that such large 
changes to longstanding law would 
happen approaching the middle of the 
night when the American people likely 
won’t realize until after the fact what 
we have done. And that could be no 
surprise. 
Does anybody really think the Amer-
ican people voted for 8 percent infla-
tion, for gas lines, for gas at over $4 a 
gallon, and for a chaotic foreign policy 
that has caused the death of many of 
our allies and many of our servicemen 
as the exit from Afghanistan showed? 
No. No one voted for that. Yet we are 
told that there is no problem, that we 
will just push ahead and we are going 
to get this done. 
We have a lot of issues that we could 
face, that Americans are facing right 
now. There is no oversight of the 
COVID relief bills amid reporting of 
waste and abuse. Inflation is sky-high; 
grocery shelves are empty; and the cri-
sis continues on our southern border. 
b 2200 
Congress has provided over $5 trillion 
in coronavirus relief funds, but no 
oversight. Billions of dollars remain 
unspent, and inflation is at its highest 
level in decades. 
Right before Christmas the President 
said everybody ought to get a COVID 
test and, by golly, he would make them 
available. 
They 
are 
not 
available 
today. I went online and ordered some 
because I thought, this may be impor-
tant. I received them 21⁄2 weeks later. 
Of course, I paid for them. These 
weren’t free from the government. 
But there aren’t enough COVID tests, 
and the hospitals and healthcare facili-
ties are on life support. 
What is our administration doing? 
What is our Democratic leadership in 
Congress doing? Nothing. 
Our response should not be so unco-
ordinated and ineffective going into 
the third year of this pandemic. And 
let me just point out, we have not had 
a single hearing in the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, where we have 
jurisdiction over this, on this very 
issue. 
Another national crisis are the hun-
dreds of thousands of migrants pouring 
over our southern border since Presi-
dent Biden took office and declared an 
open border. Our frontline border offi-
cials 
are 
overwhelmed 
and 
under- 
resourced. The open now sign remains 
on. 
And even more concerning, we re-
quire our Federal agents to take a vac-
cine. It is a mandated vaccine. And yet, 
the people coming in, it is voluntary. 
We will give them a vaccine if they 
would like, but of course, they don’t 
have to take it. 
And I will tell you, being down in El 
Paso last week, it is all about getting 
these kids in the ORR facility, getting 
them pushed through and getting them 
placed 
with 
families. 
The 
average 
length of stay now at Fort Bliss is 
down to 12 days. That means no back-
ground check. 
What are you going to do when the 
stories start emerging about how these 
children 
have 
been 
misplaced 
and 
abused in the locations that we now— 
the government—are sending them? We 
are providing the last mile to the car-
tels’ business. 
These crises remain unresolved. Con-
gress could work on these. We are sup-
posed to do that. We are the people’s 
Representatives, and yet we spend our 
time in the middle of the night doing 
something that will never become law. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD a December 24, 
2021 Guardian Article entitled ‘‘Report 
Shows the Extent of Republican Efforts 
to Sabotage Democracy.’’ 
[From The Guardian, Dec, 24, 2021] 
REPORT SHOWS THE EXTENT OF REPUBLICAN 
EFFORTS TO SABOTAGE DEMOCRACY 
The Republican assault on free and fair 
elections instigated by Donald Trump is 
gathering pace, with efforts to sabotage the 
normal workings of American democracy 
sweeping state legislatures across the US. 
A year that began with the violent insur-
rection at the US Capitol is ending with an 
unprecedented push to politicize, criminalize 
or in other ways subvert the nonpartisan ad-
ministration of elections. A year-end report 
from pro-democracy groups identifies no 
fewer than 262 bills introduced in 41 states 
that hijack the election process. 
Of those, 32 bills have become law in 17 
states. 
The largest number of bills is concentrated 
in precisely those states that became the 
focus of Trump’s Stop the Steal campaign to 
block the peaceful transfer of power after he 
lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe 
Biden. Arizona, where Trump supporters in-
sisted on an ‘‘audit’’ to challenge Biden’s 
victory in the state, has introduced 20 sub-
version bills, and Georgia where Trump at-
tempted to browbeat the top election official 
to find extra votes for him has introduced 15 
bills. 
Texas, whose ultra-right Republican group 
has made the state the ground zero of voter 
suppression and election interference, has in-
troduced as many as 59 bills. 
‘‘We’re seeing an effort to hijack elections 
in this country, and ultimately, to take 
power away from the American people. If we 
don’t want politicians deciding our elections, 
we all need to start paying attention,’’ said 
Joanna Lydgate, CEO of the States United 
Democracy Center which is one of the three 
groups behind the report. Protect Democracy 
and Law Forward also participated. 
One of the key ways that Trump-inspired 
state lawmakers have tried to sabotage fu-
ture elections is by changing the rules to 
give legislatures control over vote counts. In 
Pennsylvania, a bill passed in the wake of 
Trump’s defeat that sought to rewrite the 
state’s election law was vetoed by Demo-
cratic governor Tom Wolf. 
Now hard-right lawmakers are trying to 
bypass Wolf’s veto power by proposing a con-
stitutional amendment that would give the 
legislature the power to overrule the state’s 
chief elections officer and create a perma-
nent audit of election counts subject to its 
own will. 
In several states, nonpartisan election offi-
cials who for years have administered ballots 
impartially are being replaced by hyper-par-
tisan conspiracy theorists and advocates of 
Trump’s false claims that the election was 
rigged. In Michigan, county Republican 
groups in eight of the 11 largest counties 
have systematically replaced professional 
administration 
officials 
with 
‘‘stop 
the 
steal’’ extremists. 
Several secretaries of state, the top elec-
tion officials responsible for presidential 
election counts, are being challenged by ex-
treme Republicans who participated in try-
ing to overturn the 2020 result. Trump has 
endorsed for the role Mark Finchem in Ari-
zona, Jody Hice in Georgia and Kristina 
Karamo in Michigan who have all claimed 
falsely that Trump won and should now be in 
his second term in the White House. 
Jess Marsden, Counsel at Protect Democ-
racy, said that the nationwide trend of state 
legislatures attempting to interfere with the

work of nonpartisan election officials was 
gaining momentum. It’s leading us down an 
antidemocratic path toward an election cri-
sis,’’ she said. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
more than 260 bills were introduced in 
41 States last year to hijack the elec-
tion process. If this isn’t a national 
emergency, I don’t know what the hell 
is. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, if 
we defeat the previous question, Re-
publicans will offer an amendment to 
the rule allowing for the immediate 
consideration of H. Res. 866. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD, along 
with extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
this resolution states clearly that the 
right to vote is fundamental to democ-
racy, and that legitimate elections are 
those which are safe from foreign inter-
ference, including illegal votes from 
foreigners. 
The resolution denounces the prac-
tice by some cities in America of giv-
ing the right to vote to noncitizens, in-
cluding foreigners who have violated 
our laws by being here illegally in the 
U.S. 
The resolution states firmly that the 
House of Representatives recognizes 
that allowing illegal immigrants the 
right to vote devalues the vote of every 
United States citizen. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
present 
this 
amendment, and I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROD-
NEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
to defeat the previous question so that 
we can bring up my resolution, H. Res. 
866, to highlight how imperative it is 
for election integrity and voter con-
fidence that only American citizens 
vote in our elections. 
As Members of Congress, most of us 
have attended a naturalization cere-
mony or two during our time of serv-
ice. We have watched these very mov-
ing ceremonies as these prospective 
Americans take the oath of allegiance 
to the United States of America. They 
pledge their allegiance to our country. 
They swear to support and defend the 
Constitution against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic. 
It is one of those moments that 
makes America the greatest country 
on Earth. They have earned the right 
to vote in our elections. 
What New York City and others are 
doing, by allowing nearly a million 
noncitizens to vote, is a slap in the face 
to those who worked hard for that sa-
cred right. While I don’t support what 
New York is doing by any means, it is 
our job that we protect Federal elec-
tions. 
Common sense will tell you that 
combining 
noncitizens 
and 
eligible 
American voters on the same voter 
rolls is ripe for abuse. It is really just 
not practical. 
Currently, in Illinois, noncitizens 
cannot vote, and if they do, they face 
major legal consequences and could be 
deported. But in 2016, Illinois’ Auto-
matic Voter Registration program mis-
takenly registered to vote more than 
500 noncitizens who had done the right 
thing by checking the box stating they 
are not citizens on their driver’s li-
cense applications. 
However, several of these noncitizens 
voted in the 2018 and 2019 elections. 
This does nothing to bolster voter con-
fidence 
in 
our 
elections. 
In 
fact, 
Madam Speaker, it does the opposite. 
Not only does this undermine the in-
tegrity of our elections, but the mis-
take by Illinois could also have had 
dire consequences for these individuals 
if they seek citizenship in the future. 
All of this could be prevented if 
States were actually maintaining accu-
rate voter rolls, which has been re-
quired by Federal law for nearly 30 
years. 
Whether intentional or not, we know 
this is happening. It is undermining 
the integrity of our elections. This 
amendment would simply ensure those 
who are noncitizens, who do not have 
the right to vote in Federal elections, 
are removed from States’ voter rolls. 
This is especially critical as my friends 
on the other side of the aisle push for 
a Federal takeover of elections. 
Let’s defeat the previous question so 
that we can take a stand with my reso-
lution to support only citizens voting 
in our elections and encourage States 
to adopt reforms that don’t put non-
citizens at risk of intentionally or un-
intentionally breaking the law by ille-
gally voting in Federal elections. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just say to my colleagues, 
this is kind of pathetic. It is a non-
binding resolution that does nothing, 
and I guess attacks immigrant parents 
who 
are 
involved 
in 
local 
school 
boards, I guess. 
But I mean, really? I mean, this is 
your response to what is happening all 
across this country in terms of the at-
tacks on voting rights? 
The bill that we are talking about 
bringing to the floor, let me just tell 
you some of the things it does. Our bill, 
which will become law, would enhance 
protections for individuals with dis-
abilities. 
It would make Election Day a na-
tional holiday. It would improve elec-
tion security by requiring post-election 
audits 
and 
voter-verifiable 
paper 
records of votes. 
It would protect elections from for-
eign interference. It would promote 
digital ad transparency. 
It 
would 
end 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering. I can go on and on and on 
and on. 
But the difference here is that I 
think we recognize, and I think, unfor-
tunately, this has become a partisan 
issue because I think there are a lot of 
Independent voters and 
Republican 
voters across the country who are con-
cerned, like Democrats in the House 
are, about the attacks on voting rights. 
I mean, the idea that we have one 
State that passed a law that said it is 
going to be illegal to give people water 
who wait in a line to be able to cast 
their vote? And we know in some 
States, people have to wait for hours 
and hours and hours to vote. But some-
how, that would be criminalized; that 
that would be forbidden? I mean, give 
me a break. 
I mean, I don’t know what the hell 
happened to the Republican Party. I 
mean, I don’t know when they decided 
that the basis for who they are was a 
big lie. 
We had an election in 2020. As one of 
my colleagues pointed out, a lot of peo-
ple showed up and voted. I mean, the 
people who voted returned me and re-
turned my Republican colleagues and 
brought new Members to this body. 
And yet, they have been working 
overtime to embrace a big lie, after a 
violent insurrection, where people’s 
lives were threatened. Our staff, the 
people who work here, their lives were 
threatened. Madam Speaker, 140 Cap-
itol police officers were injured. After 
all of that, they still embraced the big 
lie and are working to try to nullify 
the legitimate votes of the people of 
this country. 
b 2210 
It is stunning to me. 
So, yeah, to take this, whatever it is, 
meaningless, 
nonbinding 
resolution, 
and, I guess, maybe you can say you 
are for something. But it is nothing. It 
is pathetic. Or we can actually do 
something about protecting the right 
of every single person in this country 
to vote. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to remind my colleague 
from Massachusetts that I believe in 
2016 he also objected to certification of 
the election. It doesn’t always sound 
like that when he speaks about the ob-
jections. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, just this morning, we learned 
that inflation rose 7 percent over the 
past year, the highest rate since 1982. 
We have empty shelves, and we have 
unfilled jobs due to the labor shortages 
across the country. Schools are shut-
ting down again, crime is soaring in 
our cities, and faith in our institutions 
is in rapid decline. 
What are Washington Democrats fo-
cused on? They want to blow up the 
rules of Congress so they can pass their 
extremist agenda to federalize local 
elections, legalize ballot harvesting,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H71 
January 12, 2022 
ban voter ID requirements, and fund 
their own campaigns with precious tax-
payer dollars. It is truly unbelievable 
to the people back home. 
CHUCK SCHUMER says this is a re-
sponse to the 2020 election and the 
State election laws passed in 2021. That 
is obviously not a true statement, be-
cause the bill they are peddling was 
first introduced in 2019. 
Joe Biden says it is to stave off the 
reemergence of a second Jim Crow era 
in States like Texas and Georgia which 
passed election integrity measures this 
year. But that is a ridiculous charge. 
Literally, it is the opposite of the facts 
that any person can verify with a sin-
gle internet search. 
The truth is, Georgia’s law has more 
days of early, in-person voting than 
Joe Biden’s own home State of Dela-
ware. 
The 2020 election saw the highest 
turnout of voters in 120 years, and ac-
cording to the Pew Research Center, 94 
percent of Americans agree it is ‘‘easy 
to vote.’’ 
There is no widespread voter suppres-
sion in this country, and everybody 
knows it. In fact, voter registration 
disparities between minority and non-
minority voters in States like Texas, 
Florida, North Carolina, Mississippi, 
and Louisiana are below the national 
average and lower than Democrat-run 
States like New York, California, and 
Delaware. Those are the facts. 
For Democrats, the only problem 
they are seeking to solve is the prob-
lem of how to secure for themselves 
more votes. 
We have heard in New York, Demo-
crats recently voted to allow foreign 
citizens to vote in American elections. 
You heard it right. It is a blatantly un-
constitutional scheme that defies the 
most basic rule of our system. Seventh 
grade civics: American elections should 
be decided by American citizens. New 
York’s ridiculous new law has been 
challenged in court. We don’t know 
what the outcome of that is going to 
be, but we can all take a stand here to-
night to reaffirm to the people of this 
great Nation that their legally cast 
votes will not be watered down and ne-
gated by the ballots of noncitizens. 
Madam Speaker, if the previous ques-
tion 
is 
defeated, 
Republicans 
will 
amend the rule to provide for consider-
ation of a resolution that acknowl-
edges this simple truth: Allowing ille-
gal immigrants and noncitizens the 
right to vote devalues the franchise 
and diminishes the voting power of 
United States citizens. 
We all have an opportunity to go on 
record right here tonight to make our 
positions on that issue clear. I urge my 
colleagues to reaffirm the rights of 
U.S. citizens and vote ‘‘no’’ on the pre-
vious question. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me remind everybody: If you vote 
‘‘no’’ on the previous question like my 
Republican colleagues would like you 
to do, you get to pass a meaningless, 
nonbinding resolution. Wow, what a 
courageous thing my friends are doing 
today. 
Let me just say to my colleague from 
Minnesota, Mrs. FISCHBACH, whom I 
have a lot of respect for, yes, some of 
us raised objections in 2016 because we 
were concerned about Russian inter-
ference in our election. I think the 
Mueller report actually proved that we 
were right on that. 
But let me ask her: How many votes 
did we have? None. Of all the people 
that objected, how much time did it 
take? Less than 8 minutes. How many 
Capitol Police, Mrs. FISCHBACH, were 
wounded that day? None. How much vi-
olence occurred in this Capitol that 
day? There was none. How much prop-
erty was destroyed that day? None. 
Compare that to what happened here, 
when many of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, after a violent 
insurrection, after an attack on this 
democracy, came here, with absolutely 
no basis of fact or evidence, and voted 
to nullify the results of a free and fair 
election in the United States of Amer-
ica. 
So when people in this country ex-
press concern—not just Democrats, but 
Independents and Republicans—when 
people express concern about the fu-
ture of our democracy, that is what 
they are talking about. 
Voting rights are under attack in 
State after State after State. We see 
what State legislatures are doing. But 
the right to vote is also being attacked 
when we have Members of this Cham-
ber who actively try to subvert the will 
of the American people. 
So you may think it is no big deal. 
Maybe you think that is what you have 
to do to try to maintain power. But the 
bottom line is, as John Lewis said, the 
right to vote is precious; it is almost 
sacred. We all have to come together, 
Democrats and Republicans, and we 
have to stand up and we have to pro-
tect it. That is what this is about. 
So talk about whatever you want to 
talk about, but the bottom line is, we 
need to do this. This is the right thing 
to do. And by proceeding in this way, 
we will at least ensure that there is a 
debate in the United States Senate, 
and hopefully there will be a vote to 
actually make this into the law of the 
land. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
just want to remind everyone that the 
issue here is the Federal takeover of 
elections. The statement that was 
made was about someone objecting to 
the certification and how that was 
somehow wrong. I just wanted to sim-
ply remind my colleague that he him-
self had voted that way and many of 
the Democrats have, over the years, 
voted to object to certification. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, once 
again, we find ourselves on the floor of 
the House of Representatives debating 
legislation to enact the great takeover 
of elections by partisan Federal bu-
reaucrats and their friends across the 
aisle and prohibit the most basic vot-
ing rights and security measures en-
trusted to the States and the American 
people. 
The so-called Freedom to Vote Act: 
John R. Lewis Act, which Democrats 
hope to attach as a rider to non-
germane legislation, will undermine 
the very integrity of our elections, not 
improve and increase access to voting, 
a mission we all share. 
The right to vote is sacred and rep-
resents the most important expression 
of self-governance as American citi-
zens. This legislation will further erode 
the confidence of the voters who have 
already lost faith in our ability to en-
sure free and fair elections. 
President Biden and his allies in Con-
gress are yet again pushing unconstitu-
tional legislation to ban popular voter 
ID laws and mandate ballot harvesting. 
This includes States that have already 
passed these commonsense laws to bol-
ster election integrity and guarantee 
that each citizen is guaranteed one 
vote in each election, not more than 
one. 
This legislation also burdens the 
American taxpayer with the obligation 
to fund political campaigns, even for 
those whom they don’t support. Worse, 
this pair of bills will open the door for 
noncitizens to vote, thus undermining 
and diluting the power of sworn citi-
zens to control their government. 
In my home State, Democrats—one- 
party rule in New York City; one-party 
rule in Albany—are already enacting 
these radical policies that drive a dag-
ger into the heart of self-governance. 
This deliberate act to erode our democ-
racy and to weaken the voting power of 
American citizens is not only wrong; it 
is unconstitutional. 
Article II of the New York State Con-
stitution explicitly states that: ‘‘Every 
citizen shall be entitled to vote at 
every election . . .’’ Section 5–102 of 
New York Election Law states: ‘‘No 
person shall be qualified to register for 
and vote at any election unless he’’ or 
she ‘‘is a citizen of the United States 
. . .’’ Finally, the 15th Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution also protects the 
right of all eligible citizens to vote. 
Subversive legislation, such as the 
law allowing noncitizens to vote signed 
recently into law in New York City, 
and most of the provisions that we are 
debating today, will, if passed, under-
mine the core principles of freedom and 
individual rights that are enshrined 
and protected by our constitutional 
Republic. 
In fact, a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll 
found that a mere 20 percent of the 
public was very confident in the integ-
rity of our election system. 
Our democratic principles and the be-
lief in the idea of ‘‘one person, one

vote’’ are under attack. When our citi-
zens lose faith in the integrity of our 
elections, this is what happens. 
We are at a crossroads. 
b 2220 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 20 
seconds. 
Ms. TENNEY. Too many precious 
American souls have sacrificed life and 
limb to protect our sacred right to 
vote. Now is the time to choose self- 
governance by, of, and for the people, 
not a takeover and surrender to par-
tisan bureaucrats. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Just a few quick things. One is, you 
know, I got a little whiplash here be-
cause, on the one hand, I am hearing 
my friends say they don’t want Federal 
interference in local elections, yet that 
is what they are proposing here. Except 
I guess they are not because this is 
nonbinding and doesn’t mean anything. 
I just point that out for the record. 
Secondly, I know my colleague from 
Minnesota. I may have misheard her 
when she said that I voted to nullify 
the election in 2016. There were no 
votes on any of the State electoral col-
lege results. I am a stickler for accu-
racy on things like that. 
Thirdly, let me remind people why 
we are here today. We are here to pass 
the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act, which would expand automatic 
voter registration and same-day reg-
istration. It would expand early voting. 
It would enhance protections for indi-
viduals with disabilities. It would 
make election day a national holiday. 
It would improve election security. It 
would protect elections from foreign 
interference. 
It will do things that, quite frankly, 
I think most reasonable people—I don’t 
care what their politics may be—would 
think is the right thing to do. 
Unfortunately, what is reasonable 
amongst the American people is not al-
ways reasonable here in the Congress. I 
think the effort that my Republican 
colleagues are engaged in really is 
about nullifying results that they don’t 
like. 
Well, do you know what? We all want 
to win elections, but sometimes we 
lose. It is not pleasant. But if that is 
what the people want, then the people 
should get what they want. 
Madam Speaker, I again urge my col-
leagues to support what we are doing 
here today, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
I have not heard any compelling ar-
guments for pushing either of these 
bills forward because the flaws are 
clear. We cannot create a one-size-fits- 
all 
election 
system 
imposed 
from 
Washington that requires States to 
provide automatic same-day voter reg-
istration, prevents States from remov-
ing dormant voters from rolls, and 
overrides State ID laws. 
The Freedom to Vote Act would also 
guarantee public dollars would go into 
certain candidates’ coffers. This is all 
nothing more than a partisan play for 
the Democrats to federalize all of 
America’s elections. They are pushing 
it because they think it will help them 
stay in power. Historically, States 
have had oversight of their own elec-
tions. 
While there is always room for im-
provement, let’s keep the Federal Gov-
ernment out of it and leave the States 
to handle their own elections, as has 
been done in the past. 
I oppose the rule and the underlying 
bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league from Minnesota for her service 
in this Congress and her service on the 
Rules Committee. 
She said that she hasn’t heard any 
compelling arguments why we should 
pass these bills. Maybe she wasn’t lis-
tening to me because I think I made a 
lot of compelling arguments here today 
about why these bills are incredibly 
important. 
Something is badly, badly broken, 
and we must have the courage to fix it, 
even if that means fixing it alone. That 
is what it means to do the right thing, 
politics be damned. 
This is about more than petty par-
tisanship. This is about whether we de-
fend democracy or we sit back and 
watch its demise. I could never live 
with myself if I did nothing, and I 
think I speak for a lot of my colleagues 
on this side of the aisle. I wish there 
were more colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle who felt that way. 
Working with my colleagues, I am 
going to try to do everything possible 
to stem the insidious tide of voter sup-
pression in this country and the at-
tempts to nullify the will of the Amer-
ican people because there is no guar-
antee that America will forever be a 
democracy. It isn’t planted in our soil. 
It isn’t floating through our air. It is 
us. We are the only ones who can guar-
antee democracy prevails, and this 
vote is about nothing less. 
I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
rule and the underlying measure. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 868 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the resolution 
(H.Res. 866) recognizing that allowing illegal 
immigrants the right to vote devalues the 
franchise and diminishes the voting power of 
United States citizens. All points of order 
against consideration of the resolution are 
waived. The resolution shall be considered as 
read. The previous question shall be consid-
ered as ordered on the resolution and pre-
amble to adoption without intervening mo-
tion or demand for division of the question 
except one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. 
SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.Res. 866. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 220, nays 
201, not voting 12, as follows:

THE SENATE SHOULD PASS 
VOTING RIGHTS LEGISLATION 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to urge the Senate to protect our 
fundamental right to vote. 
Communities of color are dispropor-
tionately targeted by the wave of voter 
suppression laws we have seen across 
America. These attacks are just the 
latest battle in the centuries-long, ra-
cially fueled war on voting rights in 
our country. 
But the right to vote is foundational 
to our democracy. Without it, we 
would cease to be a government of, by, 
and for the people. 
This is a life-and-death issue for 
America itself. The late Congressman 
John Lewis wrote that ‘‘Democracy is 
not a state. It is an act.’’ 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to 
act, to prioritize democracy and ensure 
access to the ballot box is not under-
mined. I urge them to send voting 
rights legislation to President Biden’s 
desk to be signed into law.

b 2330 
CELEBRATING NATIONAL 
PHARMACISTS DAY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in honor of a very im-
portant day we are celebrating today, 
National Pharmacists Day. 
Today we take time to recognize and 
appreciate all of our communities’ 
pharmacists and everything that they 
do for their patients. 
During the pandemic, pharmacists 
joined with the frontline workers to 
help alleviate the pandemic by distrib-
uting lifesaving medicines to their pa-
tients. 
Pharmacists are an integral part of 
each and every community. They keep 
people safe and healthy. 
As a pharmacist, I am proud to take 
time today to recognize and honor my 
colleagues 
nationwide. 
In 
a 
world 
where our frontline workers are heroes, 
we must not forget those who bond 
with their patients and ensure life-
saving and correct dosages are being 
distributed properly. 
I am proud of my time spent as a 
pharmacist, and I am very grateful for 
my colleagues and what they do to bet-
ter their communities. 
Take time today to thank your local 
pharmacist and appreciate all that 
they do. Thank you all for your service 
to our towns, our cities, and our 
States. 
f 
MOVING THE ECONOMY FORWARD 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to reflect on the remarkable progress 
of our Nation’s economy over the pre-
vious 12 months in what I suspect his-
tory will label the Biden boom. 
The progress achieved in 2021, helped 
along by the American Rescue Plan, is 
unmatched in American history. Our 
economy is growing at its fastest rate 
in 40 years. The Nation added 6.4 mil-
lion new jobs, and unemployment is 
now at 3.9 percent, representing the 
sharpest ever 1-year decline. 
J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon re-
cently said: ‘‘The consumer balance 
sheet has never been in better shape,’’ 
predicting 
continued 
extraordinary 
growth. 
A Bloomberg analysis found that 
President Biden’s first year is ranked 
either first or second among Presidents 
for, among other things, GDP growth, 
S&P 500 performance, nonfarm pay-
rolls, manufacturing jobs, and business 
productivity. 
I recognize we still have real chal-
lenges, including worker shortages, 
supply chain disruptions, and inflation. 
But working together, Congress and 
President Biden are positioned to move 
our 
economy 
forward 
and 
get 
us 
through this pandemic stronger than 
when we went in. 
Whether Republican, Democrat, Inde-
pendent, or anything else, every Amer-
ican should be celebrating the resil-
ience of the American spirit. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LOU 
GALLIKER 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life of Lou Galliker, the longtime 
president of Galliker Dairy Company, 
who passed away in December sur-
rounded by his family. He was 87 years 
old. 
The Galliker Dairy Company is a 
third-generation, 
family-owned, 
re-
gional dairy company headquartered in 
Johnstown, Pennsylvania, since 1914. 
Lou was chairman and president for 
more than half a century. He turned 
his family’s dairy business into one of 
the largest enterprises in the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania and the mid- 
Atlantic region. 
Galliker Dairy distributes ice cream, 
milk, iced tea, and other beverages 
throughout several States. 
Mr. Speaker, Lou was a giant of the 
dairy world who served as a board

member of the International Associa-
tion of Ice Cream Manufacturers and as 
a president of the Quality Chekd inde-
pendent dairy processors cooperative. 
He was equally devoted to the Johns-
town community, which he served in 
various capacities over the years. As 
president of the Chamber of Commerce 
and the greater Johnstown Jaycees and 
a board member of several other orga-
nizations, Lou was always committed 
to the region’s success. 
Lou Galliker was an incredible force 
for good in the Johnstown region, and 
he leaves a legacy that will be remem-
bered for years to come. My prayers 
are with his family. 
f 
HONORING DR. MARTIN LUTHER 
KING, JR. 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and celebrate Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 
It is often said that his were the 
words of a giant who could galvanize 
all of America around the wonderful 
concept of the ‘‘beloved community.’’ 
Dr. King was assassinated in 1968, and 
so many have come from his spirit, but 
I thought this year, in the midst of the 
very divisive fight for voting rights, we 
could just remember his marches, his 
words, believing in a dream, and recog-
nizing the goodness of America. 
He 
marched 
across 
the 
Edmund 
Pettus Bridge. He walked with our 
friend John Robert Lewis and his other 
friends Hosea Williams, Reverend An-
drew Young, and Ralph David Aber-
nathy. And he always thought that he 
could never give up, as he went to the 
White House with Lyndon Baines John-
son and insisted on the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights 
Act. 
We must honor him in these coming 
days not by words and tributes but by 
doing the right thing, building on the 
democracy that he so much dreamed 
for, even though his life was cut short, 
and to thank his family—Martin Lu-
ther King III and all of his children and 
his wife—for the sacrifice they made 
for America. I pay tribute to Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. 
f 
ENERGY PRICES AT ALL-TIME 
HIGHS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, many 
areas in northern California and across 
my district have seen record snowfall 
due to recent winter storms. That is 
good in a lot of ways, but we have seen 
that tens of thousands of residents 
have been without power for several 
weeks in freezing temperatures, and 
our Governor has banned the use of 
gas-powered generators as a heat and 
electricity source. 
Meanwhile, those who do still have 
power face all-time high energy costs 
as they try to heat their homes, thanks 
to President Biden’s anti-domestic en-
ergy policies. 
On President Biden’s first day of of-
fice, he canceled the Keystone pipeline, 
effectively killing 11,000 American en-
ergy jobs and stopping new exploration 
for oil, which has driven up energy 
prices and increased our dependence on 
foreign oil from China, Russia, and the 
Middle East. 
The cost of having our homes heated 
has increased 30 percent since last win-
ter, and more than one in four Ameri-
cans reported they were forced to forgo 
other basic expenses to pay their en-
ergy bill in this last year. 
Under the climate agenda President 
Biden has, gas prices are up nearly 60 
percent. The cost of propane, kerosene, 
firewood, and energy are all up over 30 
percent from this time last year. 
We must reverse these damaging and 
unnecessary policies and reduce our re-
liance on foreign oil before more harm 
can be done to the American people 
and our economy. 
f 
SENATE BILL REFERRED 
A bill of the Senate of the following 
title was taken from the Speaker’s 
table and, under the rule, referred as 
follows: 
S. 789. An act to repeal certain obsolete 
laws relating to Indians; to the Committee 
on Natural Resources.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 12 
months 
ago, 
a 
newly 
inaugurated 
President Biden stood on the west 
front of the Capitol, and here is what 
he had to say: 
My whole soul is in this: bringing America 
together, uniting our people, uniting our na-
tion. 
Yesterday, that very same man deliv-
ered a deliberately divisive speech that 
was designed to pull our country fur-
ther apart. 
Twelve months ago, this President 
said we should see each other not as 
adversaries but as neighbors. Yester-
day, he called millions of Americans 
his domestic ‘‘enemies.’’ 
Twelve months ago, the President 
called on Americans to ‘‘join forces, 
stop the shouting, lower the tempera-
ture,’’ but yesterday, he shouted that if 
you disagree with him, you are George 
Wallace. George Wallace? If you don’t 
pass the laws he wants, you are Bull 
Connor. And if you oppose giving 
Democrats 
untrammeled 
one-party 
control of the country, well, you are 
Jefferson Davis. 
Twelve months ago, this President 
said ‘‘disagreement must not lead to 
disunion.’’ Ah, but yesterday, he in-
voked the bloody disunion of the Civil 
War—the 
Civil 
War—to 
demonize 
Americans who disagree with him. He 
compared—listen to this—a bipartisan 
majority of Senators to literal traitors. 
How profoundly—profoundly—un-Presi-
dential. 
Look, I have known, liked, and per-
sonally respected Joe Biden for many 
years. I did not recognize the man at 
the podium yesterday. 
American voters did not give Presi-
dent Biden a mandate for very much. 
He got a tied Senate and negative coat-
tails in the House—the narrowest ma-
jorities in over a century. The Presi-
dent did not get a mandate to trans-
form America or reshape society, but 
he did arguably get a mandate to do 
just one central thing that he cam-
paigned on. Here is what that was: 
Bridge a divided country; lower the 
temperature; dial down the perpetual 
air of crisis in our politics. That is the 
one central promise that Joe Biden 
made. It is the one job citizens actually 
hired him to do. It is the one project 
that would have actually been con-
sistent—consistent—with the Congress 
that voters elected. Ah, but President 
Biden has chosen to fail his own test. 
The President’s rant—rant—yester-
day was incoherent, incorrect, and be-
neath his office. He used the phrase 
‘‘Jim Crow 2.0’’ to demagogue a law 
that makes the franchise more acces-
sible than in his own State of Dela-
ware. He blasted Georgia’s procedures

January 12, 2022 
regarding local election officials while 
pushing national legislation with al-
most identical language on that issue. 
The President implied that things 
like wildly popular ID laws are—listen 
to this—‘‘totalitarian.’’ Totalitarian? 
Ironically, on the same day, Wash-
ington, DC’s Democratic mayor told 
citizens to bring both a photo ID and a 
vaccine card anytime they leave the 
house. 
The President repeatedly invoked the 
January 6 riot, while himself using ir-
responsible, 
delegitimizing 
rhetoric 
that undermines our democracy. 
The sitting President of the United 
States compared American States to 
‘‘totalitarian 
states.’’ 
He 
said 
our 
country will be an ‘‘autocracy’’ if he 
does not get his way—if he does not get 
his way. 
So the world saw our Commander in 
Chief propagandize against his own 
country—his own country—to a degree 
that would have made Pravda blush. 
There was no consistent standard be-
hind anything the President said. He 
trampled through some of the most 
sensitive and sacred parts of our Na-
tion’s past. He invoked times when ac-
tivists bled and when soldiers died, all 
to demagogue voting laws that are 
more expansive than what Democrats 
have on the books in his own home 
State. 
Georgia has more days of early vot-
ing than Delaware or New York. Geor-
gia has no-excuse absentee voting, 
which Delaware and New York do not 
have. If Georgia or Texas presents Jim 
Crow emergencies, then so do a whole 
lot of Democratic-run States. 
The Senate Democratic leader has 
gone on cable TV saying Georgia ‘‘is 
greatly restricting or eliminating early 
voting.’’ That is a lie, provably false. 
Georgia has more early voting than 
New York. The Democratic leader has 
tried to fearmonger about one rural 
Georgia county that condensed mul-
tiple voting locations into one—one 
rural Georgia county. Well, the county 
is overwhelmingly red. They were 
clearly not involved in trying to sup-
press Democratic votes—70 percent Re-
publican in that one county in 2020. 
So take a step back for a minute. 
President Biden’s story is that democ-
racy is on death’s door, but he spent 9 
months chasing a reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree before addressing it. It 
must not be that much of an emer-
gency. Citizens are meant to believe a 
return of Jim Crow is on the table, but 
this was only President Biden’s sixth 
priority after he was blocked from 
spending $5 trillion on windmills and 
welfare. Democrats’ own behavior re-
futes their false hysteria. 
Twelve months ago, the President 
said that ‘‘politics need not be a raging 
fire destroying everything in its path.’’ 
That was just 12 months ago, but yes-
terday, he poured a giant can of gaso-
line on the fire. 
Twelve months ago, the President 
said every disagreement doesn’t have 
to be a cause for total war, but yester-
day, he said anyone who opposes 
smashing the Senate—smashing the 
Senate—and letting Democrats rewrite 
election law is a domestic ‘‘enemy’’ 
and—listen to this—a traitor like Jef-
ferson Davis. 
One week ago, President Biden gave a 
January 6 lecture about not stoking 
political violence—1 week ago. Yester-
day, with the world’s largest mega-
phone, he invoked the literal Civil War 
and said we are on the doorstep of ‘‘au-
tocracy.’’ He talked about domestic 
‘‘enemies’’—rhetoric unbecoming of a 
President of the United States. 
In less than a year, ‘‘restoring the 
soul of America’’ has become this: 
Agree with me or you are a bigot. 
Agree with me or you are a bigot—from 
lowering the temperature to invoking 
totalitarian States and the Civil War. 
This inflammatory rhetoric was not 
an attempt to persuade skeptical Dem-
ocrat or Republican Senators. This 
whole display—this whole display—in 
fact, you could not invent a better ad-
vertisement for the legislative fili-
buster than a President abandoning ra-
tional 
persuasion 
for 
pure 
dema-
goguery. You could not invent a better 
advertisement for the legislative fili-
buster than what we have just seen: a 
President abandoning rational persua-
sion for pure—pure—demagoguery. 
A President shouting that 52 Sen-
ators and millions of Americans are 
racist unless he gets whatever he wants 
is proving exactly why the Framers 
built the Senate to check his power. 
This whole display is the best pos-
sible argument for preserving—pre-
serving—the Senate rules that extend 
deliberation, 
force 
bipartisan 
com-
promise, and let cooler heads prevail. 
Nothing proves it better than this epi-
sode. It offers a perfect case study in 
why Senator Biden was right about the 
filibuster 
and 
President 
Biden 
is 
wrong. 
One respected scholar explained it 
this way: 
The smallest majority we’ve ever seen in 
our politics is trying to change the rules for 
how people get elected in every [single] 
state. . . . That’s just about the best argu-
ment for the filibuster you could possibly 
imagine. 
The citizens of the greatest country 
in the world deserve for their elected 
officials to treat them like grownups. 
The adults of America deserve to hear 
from the adults in Washington, DC. 
I will close with some basic truths. 
Obviously, our country is more di-
vided than it should be, no doubt. 
In recent years, I have vocally criti-
cized people across the political spec-
trum who have sought to legitimatize 
elections 
when 
they 
win 
and 
delegitimize democracy when they are 
polling badly or when they lose. 
I 
criticized 
the 
top 
Democrats’ 
hysteria after 2016, when their rhetoric 
had 66 percent of Democrats across 
America falsely convinced that Russia 
had hacked our voting machines and 
changed the tallies. Sixty-six percent 
of Democrats thought that after 2016. I 
criticized Speaker PELOSI and House 
Democrats who spent the runup to 2020 
hyping conspiracy theories and sug-
gesting the election would presump-
tively be illegitimate if their side lost. 
In December 2020 and January of last 
year, our side of the aisle defended our 
constitutional process despite political 
pressure, and we had, of course, a lit-
eral mob. But now it is President Biden 
and Leader SCHUMER and other Wash-
ington Democrats who don’t like their 
poll numbers. So they are reversing 
their tune yet again. The people who 
spent November 2020 through January 
2021 
preaching 
sermons 
about 
the 
strength and the sanctity of our de-
mocracy 
are 
now 
undertaking 
to 
delegitimize the next election in case 
they lose it. 
We have a sitting President—a sit-
ting President—invoking the Civil War, 
shouting about totalitarianism and la-
beling millions of Americans his do-
mestic enemies. 
We have a Senate Democratic leader 
who now frequently calls American 
elections ‘‘a rigged game.’’ 
Look, this will not be repaired with 
more lies, more outrage, and more 
rulebreaking. 
Unfortunately, President Biden has 
rejected the better angels of our na-
ture. So it is the Senate’s responsi-
bility to protect the country. This in-
stitution was constructed as a firewall 
against exactly—exactly—the kind of 
rage and false hysteria we saw on full 
display yesterday. It falls to the Sen-
ate to put America on a better track. 
It falls to us. So this institution can-
not give in to dishonorable tactics. We 
cannot surrender to this recklessness. 
We have to stand up, stand strong, pro-
tect the Senate, and defend the coun-
try. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want 
to applaud the Republican leader, the 
Senator from Kentucky, for saying 
what needed to be said. If there is a 
unique role for the U.S. Senate in our 
system of government, it is to be the 
place where debate and deliberation, 
common sense and compromise, prevail 
over demagoguery. 
And, unfortunately, what we heard 
from President Biden yesterday was 
sheer demagoguery. And I agree that it 
was not only unbecoming of the Presi-
dent of the United States; it was, 
frankly, embarrassing. Many of us were 
embarrassed for him that he would re-
sort to that sort of rhetoric, particu-
larly when Members of his own polit-
ical party are not on board asking him 
to do what he wants to do, which is to 
break the rules of the U.S. Senate. 
So until this debate began, many 
Americans probably didn’t think twice 
about something called the filibuster. 
And as we have all tried to explain why 
it is important and what role the fili-
buster plays in our system of govern-
ment, I think it is perhaps best de-
scribed as a mechanism to force us to

do what doesn’t come naturally, and 
that is to build consensus, to work to-
gether in the best interest of the coun-
try, and to pass laws that will endure, 
not those that will be reversed with the 
new majority, with the next election. 
When you think about a country like 
ours, with 330 million people, as diverse 
as it is, it just makes sense for us to 
have fulsome debate and deliberation, 
because the risk of making mistakes, 
of unintended consequences, is great, 
and there is no body in America that 
can fix mistakes made by the U.S. Con-
gress. 
So deliberation is an important func-
tion, and that is why forcing us to do 
what doesn’t come naturally, which 
means to work together and build con-
sensus to get 60 votes to cut off debate, 
is such a critical role. 
Well, unfortunately, our colleagues 
have—according to the Democratic 
leader and the majority leader—our 
colleagues have chosen to leave bipar-
tisanship and tradition at the door in 
order to grow their own political 
power. 
Make no mistake, they face an uphill 
battle. Two of our Democratic col-
leagues have stated their outright op-
position, and I imagine others who hold 
the same view who have not wanted to 
catch the slings and arrows that have 
made their way toward the Senator 
from Arizona and the Senator from 
West Virginia. 
There are many other Democratic 
Senators who hold the same concerns 
in private. Still, the majority leader is 
determined to light the Senate rule 
book on fire. 
As this Chamber considers such an 
extreme move, I want to share some 
wise words from one of our former col-
leagues. That would be former Senator 
Joe 
Biden. 
The 
current 
President 
served in the Senate for three and a 
half decades and held a deep reverence 
for the rules and the traditions and the 
norms that govern this body—at least, 
he did. Back in 2005, the Senate was 
weighing whether or not to eliminate 
the 60-vote requirement for certain ju-
dicial nominees. At that time we had a 
Republican majority and a Democratic 
minority. The shoe was on the other 
foot. But Senator Biden—or then-Sen-
ator Biden—was absolutely clear about 
his feelings on the matter. He said: 
Eliminating 
the 
filibuster—the 
so- 
called nuclear option—is ‘‘an example 
of the arrogance of power’’—‘‘the arro-
gance of power.’’ 
Now, that is not an ambiguous state-
ment. That is not a qualified state-
ment. That is not a contingent state-
ment. That is a declarative statement 
about what eliminating the filibuster 
is—an arrogance of power. 
Back in 2005, then-Senator Biden be-
lieved that changing the rules to ben-
efit yourself or your political party is 
an example of that arrogance of power. 
And he called it ‘‘a fundamental power 
grab by the majority party.’’ But now 
President Biden obviously holds the 
exact opposite view. In other words, he 
has done a spectacular flip-flop. 
Now that his party is the one in 
power, he is not only OK with the idea 
of this arrogance of power, this power 
grab, he endorses it. He advocates for 
it. 
He is willing to use some of the 
strongest rhetoric I have ever heard 
come from a President of the United 
States to condemn it, to condemn the 
filibuster and endorse its destruction. 
In Georgia, yesterday, President Biden 
made his new position on the filibuster 
crystal clear. He said: ‘‘Let the major-
ity prevail.’’ 
The move he once called ‘‘a funda-
mental power grab’’ is now his new leg-
islative strategy. And President Biden 
isn’t the only one to have done a com-
plete flip-flop when it comes to the fili-
buster, when it is opportunistic, when 
it is convenient, when it is expedient. 
Senator DURBIN, the Democratic ma-
jority whip, also used to have a deep 
respect for the traditions of the Sen-
ate. He said that, if the filibuster were 
eliminated, ‘‘that would be the end of 
the Senate as it was originally devised 
and created going back to our Found-
ing Fathers.’’ But his respect for these 
traditions, these norms, these rules 
dissipated when it became a political 
inconvenience. 
Last year, Senator DURBIN, the Sen-
ator from Illinois, said the filibuster 
‘‘has become the death grip of democ-
racy.’’ 
I am not sure if he is proud of it now, 
but Senator SCHUMER was also an advo-
cate for the filibuster in the not-so-dis-
tant past. Just a few years ago—again, 
when the shoe was on the other foot 
and Democrats were a minority, and 
Republicans were a majority—he said 
we should ‘‘build a fire wall around the 
legislative filibuster’’ to protect the 
Senate from ‘‘the winds of short-term 
electoral change.’’ 
Well, today, for sure, the winds have 
shifted. The Senator who once sup-
ported the filibuster now finds himself 
as the majority leader, trying to ap-
pease the most radical elements in his 
political base. 
Where does he stand on the filibuster 
today? Well, he is whipping votes to 
eliminate it. Democrats who once 
hailed the filibuster as a vital stabi-
lizing force in our government now call 
it a weapon of mass destruction, a 
mockery of American democracy, and 
even a Jim Crow relic. 
Let’s not forget that, just about a 
year and a half ago, Democrats used 
this Jim Crow relic to block an anti- 
lynching bill. That is right. I was here 
on the Senate floor when the now-Vice 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
KAMALA
HARRIS, and CORY
BOOKER 
from New Jersey, our colleague from 
New Jersey, participated in a filibuster 
to block a motion to proceed to a po-
lice reform bill that contained their 
own anti-lynching bill in it. Shocking 
to me. They didn’t even want to begin 
discussion of the bill—their own anti- 
lynching bill. 
Well, now that Democrats control all 
levers of government, they have tossed 
their previous convictions in the trash. 
Their agenda, securing a result that 
will result in a permanent partisan ad-
vantage, that is their sole focus. Our 
colleagues seem to have been blinded 
by the possibility of short-term vic-
tories, and they are ignoring the longer 
term repercussions, because, in the 
Senate, 
what 
goes 
around 
comes 
around. 
Let’s say that Democrats muster 
enough support to take a wrecking ball 
to the Senate rules. They blow up the 
rules and pass this so-called election 
bill with only 50 votes plus the tie- 
breaking vote of the Vice President. 
They would likely spend the rest of the 
year checking other items off of their 
radical wish list. This idea about a 
carve-out for one kind of bill is just 
malarkey, to use the President’s term. 
They would clearly use this to craft 
new laws to curb Second Amendment 
rights, expand access to abortion, and 
decimate important industries in the 
United States like the oil and gas in-
dustry. At the same time, the Presi-
dent is asking for Vladimir Putin and 
OPEC to pump more oil because the 
price of gasoline has gone through the 
roof. 
Well, our colleagues like the sound of 
that—eliminating the filibuster—but 
they aren’t prepared for what inevi-
tably would come next. 
The great genius of our system and of 
our country is that power is not abso-
lute, and, ultimately, all power lies in 
the hands of we the people, and we are 
all directly accountable to the people 
we represent. 
If voters reject Democrats’ power 
grab and hand Republicans the Senate 
majority, Democrats would, if they 
were successful today or tomorrow, 
have zero impact on the legislative 
process. You could just ignore Demo-
crats and plow your way to a certain 
result. They would have no way of 
stopping legislation they absolutely 
abhor from becoming law, and the 
States they represent, represented by 
Democratic Senators, those Senators 
would be irrelevant. Think about that. 
All of us worked hard to get here. All 
of us are proud of the fact that our vot-
ers elected us to represent them in this 
most august body known on the planet, 
but if you happen to be in the minor-
ity, under the current position taken 
by the President and the majority lead-
er and our Senate Democratic friends— 
almost all of them—those Senators 
elected in blue States would have zero 
impact. They might as well not even 
show up. 
If voters reject the Democrats’ power 
grab and hand Republicans the major-
ity, they would have no say in the leg-
islative process, if they are successful. 
A 
Republican-controlled 
Senate 
could pass new laws to protect the 
right to life, secure the border, expand 
and enhance Second Amendment rights 
under the Constitution, and much, 
much more. 
If that were to happen, would Demo-
crats stand by the rules change that 
they are debating and advocating for

today? Would they stand by their deci-
sion to silence the minority party and 
minority Senators? Would they agree 
with President Biden’s statement, ‘‘Let 
the majority prevail’’? 
Well, we don’t have to wonder be-
cause we have seen this movie before. 
Our colleagues have already expressed 
regrets over the previous filibuster 
carve-out. 
Contrary to the strong statement 
Democrats made in 2005 advocating for 
the filibuster to be maintained, they 
started chipping away at it just 8 years 
later. 
In 2013, Democrats eliminated the 60- 
vote threshold for judicial nominees, 
and the move has haunted them for 
nearly a decade and resulted in the 
confirmation of three Supreme Court 
Justices 
during 
President 
Trump’s 
term of office. 
Back then, when they invoked the 
nuclear 
option, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL 
said: 
You will regret this, and you may regret 
this a lot sooner than you think. 
Reflecting on that moment a few 
years ago, Senator BENNET, one of our 
Colorado colleagues, was clear. He said 
Senator MCCONNELL was right. 
Under the previous administration, 
the Republican-led Senate confirmed 
more than 230 conservative judges, all 
thanks to the Democrats’ elimination 
of the filibuster when it comes to 
nominations. 
The senior Senator from Colorado 
isn’t the only one who has shown re-
morse after ending up on the losing 
side of that rules change. Senator 
TESTER, our colleague from Montana, 
said voting on that rule change was 
‘‘probably the biggest mistake [he] 
ever made.’’ 
Senator SHAHEEN, our colleague from 
New Hampshire, concluded that ‘‘it has 
not served us well.’’ 
Even Senator SCHUMER, the majority 
leader, has said that ‘‘I wish it hadn’t 
happened.’’ 
And as a reminder, this is only in ref-
erence to Federal judges. These indi-
viduals hold tremendous power, no mis-
take about it. 
But now we are talking about rule 
changes that stipulate how laws are 
made, not how nominations are consid-
ered. This is the so-called legislative 
calendar, and what happens in the 
wake of this change would impact 
every single family across the country. 
When 
Republicans, 
inevitably, 
at 
some point, take the majority again, it 
would be a simple thing, with 51 votes, 
to dismantle all of the laws that our 
Democratic colleagues have passed if 
they were to eliminate the filibuster. 
Then, of course, when Democrats take 
control again, the reverse would hap-
pen. 
You know, I think that the 60-vote 
requirement is forcing us to do some-
thing that doesn’t come natural, and 
that is to force us to work together to 
build consensus. I think that is what 
the American people want us to do, to 
work together. And the filibuster, that 
60-vote requirement to close off debate, 
forces us to do just that. It eliminates 
the possibility that we can, with a 
mere majority of 51 votes, have our 
way, only to see it reversed after the 
next election. That is not good for the 
country. That is not good for our con-
stituents. That doesn’t create the sort 
of predictable, enduring laws that the 
American people should be able to rely 
on. 
Well, when it comes to eliminating 
the filibuster, Senator Biden’s line 
about ‘‘the arrogance of power’’ is ex-
actly that. At some point, the shoe will 
be on the other foot—it always hap-
pens—which is why no party, neither 
party, has been so shortsighted, until 
now, to try to eliminate the legislative 
filibuster. No party has ever been so 
power hungry and so shortsighted as to 
shatter the norms and traditions of 
this institution. 
I would like to close with one more 
quote from then-Senator Biden back in 
2005. He said: 
What shortsightedness, and what a price 
history will exact on those who support this 
radical move. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, last week, 
the Vice President of the United States 
told us that a riot that happened here 
in the U.S. Capitol last year was the 
equivalent of the day in which Japan 
attacked us at Pearl Harbor and the 
United States was pulled into a world 
war that took the lives of over 3 per-
cent of the world’s population. 
And yesterday, we were treated to 
the President telling us that election 
laws that are being passed by various 
States across the country over the last 
year are basically the same, the equiv-
alent, of the segregation that existed 
in this country in the 1950s and 1960s 
and before. 
Now, look, if your daily routine is to 
wake up in the morning and turn on 
MSNBC as you ride your Peloton and 
then you go on Twitter as you are 
drinking your caramel macchiato and 
then you are reading the New York 
Times as you are eating your avocado 
toast, I imagine all this makes perfect 
sense to you. After all, for these peo-
ple, they believe this ridiculous nar-
rative that every Republican—every 
Republican—is 
an 
insurrectionist, 
probably a racist, wants to overthrow 
the U.S. Government, and wants to de-
stroy democracy. 
The good news is that the over-
whelming majority of Americans hap-
pen to live back here on planet Earth. 
And what they are worried about, to 
the extent they even pay attention to 
any of this stuff that has been said 
over the last 2 weeks—what they are 
really worried about is the fact that 
everything costs more; you go to the 
grocery store and the shelves are 
empty; they have a small business and 
they hire someone on Monday who just 
disappears on Thursday and never 
comes back; you have got, every day, 
thousands of people illegally entering 
the United States across an open bor-
der; and, by the way, we have a surge 
in violent crime and lawlessness across 
the country. That is probably what 
they are worried about—in fact, I know 
it is—on a daily basis. 
But to the extent they have paid at-
tention to any of this, let me tell you 
something. First of all, I think almost 
everyone would tell you that what hap-
pened on January 6 here was a terrible 
thing; it should never have happened; 
and it should never happen again. 
But I don’t care how many candle-
light vigils and musical performances 
you have from the cast of ‘‘Hamilton,’’ 
you are not going to convince, at least 
most normal and sane people, that our 
government last year was almost over-
thrown by a guy wearing a Viking hat 
and Speedos. OK? 
And I don’t care, you know, how 
many of these speeches the President 
gives in which he shouts out this hy-
perbole and all this melodrama, you 
are not going to convince people that 
having a State pass a law that says, for 
example, that you have to produce an 
identification is the same as segrega-
tion. 
Nevertheless, despite the fact that 
that is what most people in this coun-
try are worried about—inflation and all 
these other things—that is not what we 
are working on here. That is not what 
we will spend this week on. That is not 
what the priority of this administra-
tion has been. That is not what the 
President is giving speeches about. You 
may care about inflation back home. 
They care about the fact—their crisis 
is that there are some laws in this 
country, for example, some States in 
this country, that do not automati-
cally force everyone to register to vote. 
They just automatically register them. 
Well, that is the crisis. 
They don’t care that store shelves 
are empty. In fact, they have denied 
that the store shelves are actually 
empty. 
For them, the real problem is that 
States have laws, for example, that 
don’t allow these roving gangs of activ-
ists to bully people into turning over 
their ballot so they can show up at 6:59 
p.m. on election day and just dump it 
on an elections official. 
And by the way, they don’t seem 
overly concerned that there are Ameri-
cans that will be fired or not allowed 
into a restaurant unless they can 
produce their papers, their vaccine 
card. 
The real problem is how dare you ask 
them to produce a voter ID—a photo ID 
in order to vote. That is their real 
problem. 
So how can this be? I mean, how can 
there be such an enormous disconnect 
between what real people in the real 
world care about and are talking about 
on a daily basis and what we are going 
to spend our time talking about here 
and these speeches that have been 
given over the last week?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S169 
January 12, 2022 
It isn’t about the Capitol riot. Every-
one agrees the Capitol riot was terrible 
and shouldn’t have happened—I think 
most everyone does. But these are 
some 
of 
the 
same 
people 
who 
downplayed over 700 riots, thousands of 
cases of looting that happened in 
America in the summer of 2020. 
It most certainly isn’t about election 
laws that have been passed in the last 
year. They have been pushing these 
same bills with different titles and dif-
ferent names—they have been pushing 
all of this for the better part of a dec-
ade. 
And it certainly isn’t about voting 
rights. It is easier than it has ever been 
in the history of the United States to 
register to vote and to vote. And the 
proof is that in 2020, we had the highest 
turnout 
in 
over 
100-and-something 
years. This isn’t about any of that. 
If you are paying attention, let me 
tell you what this is about. This is 
about power. It is about power. This is 
about changing the rules of the Senate 
so 
they 
have 
the 
power 
to 
ram 
through—to ram through—an election 
law. 
And 
this 
is 
about 
ramming 
through an election law to make sure 
that they never lose power, to make it 
easier to win elections for them and, 
therefore, have power for perpetuity. 
You want to talk about defending de-
mocracy? Let’s talk about the Ameri-
cans, real people, who are afraid to do-
nate to a political campaign, to put a 
bumper sticker on their car, to tell 
people who they voted for. They are 
afraid because they don’t want to get 
canceled; they don’t want to get boy-
cotted; they don’t want to get har-
assed—so they are afraid. They don’t 
want to get smeared. 
Do you want to talk about totali-
tarianism? Let’s talk about the fact 
that the Attorney General of the 
United States has said let’s go after 
some of these parents complaining at 
school boards and treat them as domes-
tic terrorists. 
And, listen, if you want to talk about 
segregation, then let’s talk about a 
system of education that is both sepa-
rate and unequal, divided between the 
people who can afford to spend $50,000 
or $60,000 a year to send their kids to a 
fancy school where they get SAT tutor-
ing and they get all kinds of advan-
tages and the thousands—no, mil-
lions—of American parents who are 
Hispanic and African American and 
others who have no choice whatsoever 
as to where their kids go to school. 
They have no voice. They have to send 
their kid to the school the government 
tells them. 
These people don’t care about any of 
this because it is about power. It is not 
just the power to change election laws. 
We have seen it. It is about the power 
to tell you what you are allowed to 
say. It is about the power to tell you 
where you are allowed to go. It is about 
the power to tell you what you are al-
lowed to do. It is about the power to in-
timidate, to destroy, to smear, to call 
a racist, a bigot, a hater anyone who 
dares get in your way, anyone who 
dares disagree with you. It is about the 
power to do that. 
Well, let me tell you something. I 
was raised by and have lived my entire 
life alongside people who lost their 
country, the country of their birth, to 
power-hungry people just like that. 
I warn you, do not stand by and allow 
it to happen to this one. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
JANUARY 6 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I wish 
it were the case that everyone agrees 
that what happened here on January 6 
was an abomination, but that is simply 
not true. That is simply not true. Many 
of my Republican colleagues will say 
the right things on the Senate floor— 
occasionally will whisper the right 
things to us when the cameras aren’t 
watching. But a recent poll—a non-
partisan Monmouth University poll— 
asked Republican voters whether or 
not they thought January 6 was a le-
gitimate protest. And guess what. Half 
of Republican voters in this country 
say that the invasion of this Capitol 
that involved chants for the death of 
the Vice President, a gallows outside 
the U.S. Capitol—half of Republicans 
believe that that was a legitimate pro-
test. Seven out of ten Republicans 
today don’t believe that Joe Biden is 
the legitimate President. They believe 
that Donald Trump won the election, 
despite the fact that he lost by 7 mil-
lion votes. 
And the reason for that is mostly 
that the leader of the Republican 
Party, Donald Trump, has been legiti-
mizing violence, urged those protests 
and that insurrection attempt, cheered 
them at the end of the day on January 
6, and also because we have seen most-
ly silence from mainstream Repub-
licans who know better but don’t want 
to pick a fight with President Trump. 
So, yes, we are worried about the fu-
ture of our Republic. We are worried 
about the future of our Republic be-
cause a mainstream political party has 
gotten behind the idea that power mat-
ters more than elections; that violence 
is a legitimate means of protest. 
So this idea that everybody agrees 
that January 6 was an abomination 
just isn’t true. It is not true, and that 
is, in part, why we are so worried. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. President, I want to talk about 
two subjects today, and the first is this 
question of the rules of the Senate be-
cause I have listened with great inter-
est over the last few days as my Repub-
lican colleagues have come down to the 
floor to extol the virtues of Senate tra-
dition. They explained the danger of 
changing the rules so that the majority 
vote in the Senate can pass legislation. 
It doesn’t sound like a radical idea; 
that if the majority of Senators want a 
piece of legislation to pass, it should 
pass. But this idea that the filibuster is 
part of the original design of our de-
mocracy or our Senate or that the cur-
rent use of the filibuster is consistent 
with Senate tradition is just not true. 
Our 
Founding 
Fathers—yes, 
they 
built a system of government that was 
designed to make rapid change, even 
change supported by the majority of 
voters, really, really hard to imple-
ment. 
They designed two different legisla-
tive Chambers, the President with veto 
power, staggered terms for Senators, 
but our Founding Fathers considered a 
supermajority requirement for legisla-
tion in the Congress, and they rejected 
it as too great a limitation on the will 
of the people. 
Now, admittedly, at the time of our 
founding, there were other checks on 
the voters’ will being quickly trans-
formed into policy changes. Back then, 
for instance, only White men could 
vote. The citizenry at the time wasn’t 
even trusted to directly elect the Mem-
bers of this body. But in the decades 
that followed, the American people de-
manded more democracy, and they got 
it. 
Why? Because as our grand experi-
ment of democracy continues, we saw 
proof of concept. The people could be 
trusted to govern themselves. They 
could choose leaders who were more 
able, more honest, more effective than 
any King or Queen or Sultan or Em-
peror. 
So we extended the franchise univer-
sally. We decided to have the Senate be 
directly elected, and as America ex-
panded, the new States out in the 
West, they gobbled up even more de-
mocracy. The West decided to elect not 
just legislators but judges and prosecu-
tors, dog catchers and insurance com-
missioners. The majoritarian rule, as 
America grew, became addictive, and 
as our country grew, our citizens de-
manded more of it. 
Now, in the context of the Founders’ 
intentions and the long-term trend to-
ward more democracy, this 60-vote re-
quirement, this supermajority require-
ment in the Senate, which doesn’t exist 
in any other high-income democracy— 
it stands out like a sore, rotting 
thumb. This anti-majoritarian drain 
clog is designed intentionally to stop 
the majority of Americans from get-
ting what they want from government 
because that is what it is. 
Why should it not be up to the voters 
and not politicians to decide the laws 
of this Nation? 
With a 60-vote threshold, that deci-
sion is robbed from voters. Given that 
only one-third of the Senate is up for 
election every 2 years, it is just impos-
sible for voters on their own to move 
one party from, say, 46 or 48 Members 
of this body to 60 Members in one elec-
tion, and we all know this. 
But right now the American public is 
in no mood for the choices of elites to 
be continually substituted for their 
collective judgment. Right now, Amer-
icans are in a pretty revolutionary 
mood, and you can understand why. 
More Americans today than at any 
time in recent history see themselves

on the precipice of financial and spir-
itual ruin. So why on Earth would our 
message amidst this growing populous 
tempest be to tell voters that rules are 
required to protect them from their 
bad judgment, to take from them pur-
posely the ability to change policies 
whenever and however they wish? 
Now, Senate Republicans will say 
that even though the filibuster is anti- 
majoritarian—right, it is. It says that 
even if the public installs a majority in 
the Senate that wants policy A, the 
rules are going to be constructed in the 
Senate to prevent it from happening. 
Senate Republicans will say that even 
though it is anti-majoritarian, it is for 
good reason because, as I have heard 
many of my colleagues say, it pro-
motes compromise. 
Well, I have been in the Senate now 
for 8, 9 years. Once in a blue Moon, like 
this summer on the infrastructure bill, 
there is a big bipartisan achievement. 
But anyone who believes that the rules 
of the Senate right now incentivizes bi-
partisanship should just watch the 
Senate for, like, a few days. 
Today, the 60-vote threshold just al-
lows the minority to sit back and say, 
no, no, no, over and over again, in large 
part, because its usage has changed so 
much. It didn’t used to be that the fili-
buster, the 60-vote threshold, was ap-
plied to everything. 
Up until the 1970s, cloture votes were 
almost nonexistent in the Senate. Big 
things routinely passed with 50 votes. 
Think about this. In 1994, Senator 
FEINSTEIN forced a vote here on one of 
the most controversial topics that we 
could talk about—a ban on assault 
weapons. It received, in 1994, fewer 
votes than did the Manchin-Toomey 
background checks bill 30 years later. 
But the assault weapons ban, arguably 
way more controversial than the back-
ground checks bill, passed and became 
law while the background checks bill 
didn’t. Why? Because in 1994, many im-
portant votes, even the assault weap-
ons ban, were allowed to proceed on a 
majority-vote basis. 
That 
all 
changed, 
mostly 
when 
Democrats won the Senate in 2007, and 
Barack Obama was elected President. 
But no matter who started this policy 
of applying the 60-vote threshold to ev-
erything, today both parties use it. 
Democrats used it when we were in the 
minority. 
The practice of the filibuster doesn’t 
jibe with this clarion call of adhering 
to Senate tradition because Senate tra-
dition is not to use the 60-vote thresh-
old on everything. Let’s be honest. We 
are not going back to a world in which 
Senators self-regulate the filibuster. 
And there is no sign that the claim the 
filibuster is an incentive for biparti-
sanship is going to suddenly become 
true. 
Today, millions of voters are won-
dering why they vote to change the 
people who get elected but then noth-
ing actually changes. 
We should have a better answer than 
just Senate tradition. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. President, President Biden’s de-
cision to remove our remaining troops 
from Afghanistan was the right one, no 
question about it. 
President Trump set the Biden ad-
ministration up for failure. Trump’s 
agreement with the Taliban committed 
us to withdrawing all of our troops, and 
had Biden torn up that agreement, he 
would have had to send tens of thou-
sands of troops into Afghanistan to 
push 
back 
the 
Trump-era 
Taliban 
gains. The American public would not 
have supported another Afghanistan 
troop surge and for good reason. The 
overnight collapse of the Afghan Army 
and Government was, frankly, proof 
that 20 years of nation building had 
failed, and another 20 years wasn’t 
going to result in a different outcome. 
President Biden made the right deci-
sion to leave. The American people, by 
a large margin, support that decision. 
But right now we need to be honest. 
The question of what to do now, as Af-
ghanistan crumbles into a nightmarish 
failed state, is a moral knot almost im-
possible to untangle. 
As chair of the Foreign Relations 
subcommittee that oversees Afghani-
stan policy, I thought a lot about this 
question, and I have come to a few con-
clusions that I want to share quickly 
with my colleagues. 
First, let’s just take a minute to talk 
about what it is like to be living in Af-
ghanistan right now. It is a nightmare. 
Once the U.S. military occupation and 
all the foreign aid that came with it 
disappeared, the Afghanistan economy 
collapsed, predictably. 
Today, winter is setting in, and more 
than half of the population—23 million 
people—don’t have enough food to eat. 
By this summer, 97 percent of Afghans 
will be living below the poverty line, 
trying to survive on less than $2 a day. 
With 9 million people just one step 
away from famine, this humanitarian 
crisis could kill more Afghans than the 
past 20 years of war. 
And herein lies the quandary. On one 
side is what sounds like a pretty clear 
and convincing argument. Essentially, 
the Taliban has to own this. We warned 
the Taliban that this collapse would 
occur if they took the nation by force. 
That is why we sat at a table with 
them and tried to explain that it was 
in their best interests and the best in-
terests of the nation for the Taliban to 
share power with the elected Afghan 
Government. 
But the Taliban did not listen. They 
took Kabul and should own the results. 
To send billions to solve the humani-
tarian crisis they caused would be to 
bail the Taliban out and incentivize 
other insurgent groups to make simi-
lar, rash decisions. 
But on the other hand is an equally 
clear and convincing argument. 
We stood by the Afghan people for 
two decades—protecting them, working 
with them. We spent hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars helping to raise up the 
future of millions Afghan families, 
women, and girls. And now those same 
Afghans, those same families, the ones 
who, frankly, have nothing to do with 
the Taliban are dying, potentially, by 
the tens of thousands. And we have the 
power to do something about it. How 
could we let the Afghan people die 
needlessly if we have the power to stop 
it? 
Now, we possess this power because it 
is U.S. policy toward the Taliban gov-
ernment that is contributory toward 
this crisis. It is not the proximate 
cause, but it is contributory. When 
Kabul fell suddenly last August, the 
administration sensibly froze $7 billion 
of the former Afghan Government’s as-
sets that are held at the Federal Re-
serve that we didn’t want the Taliban 
to control. But that money isn’t ours; 
it rightfully belongs to the Afghan peo-
ple. Further, our sanctions on the 
Taliban—completely justified because 
of the Taliban’s embrace of terrorism— 
essentially handcuffs the Afghan econ-
omy and therefore contributes to the 
country’s economic descent. So we 
need to understand that our policies 
are contributing to the humanitarian 
crisis in Afghanistan. 
But what if these two points—that 
the Taliban should own this and that 
we can’t stand by, idly, while people 
die—what if they aren’t in 100-percent 
contrast? What if we could help the Af-
ghan people without directly empow-
ering the Taliban? Wouldn’t that be 
the best possible answer? 
The good news is, is that the middle 
road is possible. I am going to be hon-
est. It is not easy, but it is possible. 
Over the last 20 years, the United 
States has spent billions in our tax-
payer dollars to build schools and 
health clinics and a robust civil serv-
ice. The number of schools today, for 
instance, is five times higher in Af-
ghanistan than it was in 2001. That is 
because of American investment. 
We can and we should find ways to 
pay the salaries of those who work at 
these nonpolitical institutions through 
the U.N. and NGOs on the ground, 
going around the Taliban-led govern-
ment to keep those essential services 
running and to inject some much need-
ed money into the economy. Again, 
this isn’t easy to do, but it is worth-
while given the stakes. 
We can also support the U.N. di-
rectly. Yesterday, the U.N. asked for a 
$4.5 billion call in humanitarian aid to 
stave off catastrophe in Afghanistan. 
This is the largest single-country ap-
peal in history. That should tell you 
about the scale of the crisis that we are 
facing. It is larger than what we see in 
Syria or Yemen or Ethiopia. 
I support the administration’s deci-
sion to dedicate an additional $308 mil-
lion in humanitarian aid to Afghani-
stan. That money can help save lives. 
But Congress should authorize more. 
Make no mistake, the Taliban and, 
frankly, 20 years of corrupt Afghan 
Government do own this debacle. The 
choices they made have led to this day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S171 
January 12, 2022 
But our hands aren’t clean. Our mis-
managed occupation is part of the 
story. 
Right now, as the Afghan economy 
collapses and families face starvation, 
burying our heads in the sand is not a 
solution. We can find ways to save lives 
without unreasonably empowering the 
Taliban. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Arkansas. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President: 
Right now, we are on the precipice of 
a constitutional crisis. We are about to 
step into the abyss. I want to talk for 
a few minutes why we are on that prec-
ipice and why we are looking into the 
abyss. 
Let me first ask a fundamental question: 
What is the crisis that calls for the undoing 
of two centuries of tradition? . . . Are . . . 
Senators merely doing their jobs as legisla-
tors, responding to a generalized public call-
ing for the abolition of the filibuster? Clear-
ly not. It is not the American people at large 
who are demanding detonation of the nuclear 
option. 
[T]he nuclear option is being pushed large-
ly by the radioactive rhetoric of a small 
band of radicals who hold in their hands the 
political fortunes of the President. 
Constitutional scholars will tell us that 
the reason we have these rules in the Sen-
ate—unlimited debate, two-thirds to change 
the rules, the idea that 60 have to close off 
debate—is embodied in the spirit and rule of 
the Constitution. . . . That is what the Con-
stitution is all about, and we all know it. 
It is the Senate where the Founding Fa-
thers established a repository of checks and 
balances. It is not like the House of Rep-
resentatives where the majority leader or 
the Speaker can snap his fingers and get 
what he wants. . . . On important issues, the 
Founding Fathers wanted—and they were 
correct in my judgment—that the slimmest 
majority should not always govern. . . . The 
Senate is not a majoritarian body. 
The bottom line is very simple: The 
ideologues in the Senate want to turn what 
the Founding Fathers called the cooling sau-
cer of democracy into the rubber stamp of 
dictatorship. . . . They want to make this 
country into a banana republic where if you 
don’t get your way, you change the rules! 
Are we going to let them? It’ll be a dooms-
day for democracy if we do. 
I, for one, hope and pray that it will not 
come to this. But I assure my colleagues, at 
least speaking for this Senator . . . I will do 
everything I can to prevent the nuclear op-
tion from being invoked not for the sake of 
myself or my party but for the sake of this 
great Republic and its traditions. 
Those are powerful words, but they 
are not mine. Every word of my speech 
today was originally spoken by our es-
teemed colleague, the senior Senator 
from New York, CHUCK SCHUMER. Sen-
ator SCHUMER spoke so eloquently in 
defense of the Senate’s rules, customs, 
and traditions when the fortunes of his 
party looked a little different. My, how 
times have changed. Now it is Senator 
SCHUMER’s fingers that are hovering 
over the nuclear button, ready to de-
stroy the Senate for partisan advan-
tage. 
Think about it. The narrowest major-
ity in Senate history wants to break 
the Senate rules to control how voters 
in every State elect Senators. Could 
there be a better argument to pre-
serving the Senate’s rules, customs, 
and traditions? 
So, before it is too late, let us reflect 
on the wise and eloquent words of Sen-
ator SCHUMER’s, words that are as true 
today as they were when he spoke 
them, even if Senator SCHUMER is sing-
ing a different tune today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, the 
Senate is designed to be a place where 
the Members of the minority party and 
the millions of Americans they rep-
resent are heard. In this Senate, the 
minority could not be any bigger. In 
fact, if the minority were any bigger, 
we would be in the majority. This is a 
50–50 Senate, and it is no time to take 
away the protections that the Senate 
for almost 200 years has afforded to the 
minority. The considerations given to 
the minority are important not only to 
the Senators and the millions of people 
they represent, but I think they are 
important in how the country moves 
forward. 
I served in the House. I like the 
House. I watch the House as closely as 
any Senator does. Every time the 
House changes, the House passes a 
bunch of pretty dramatic legislation. 
Then it comes to the Senate. That dra-
matic legislation they passed in the 
House doesn’t go anywhere in the Sen-
ate. When the House changes again— 
and it has a number of times in the last 
20 years—the other side comes in and 
passes legislation that reverses all of 
that and maybe does a little dramatic 
legislation of their own that also 
doesn’t go anywhere when it gets to 
the Senate. 
If all laws were passed by a simple 
majority, there would be the potential 
for the majority to rewrite the coun-
try’s laws constantly, no matter how 
small the shift in power was. It is al-
ways a mistake, frankly, to act like 
you have a mandate if you don’t have 
one. It is a mistake for the country to 
change direction dramatically before 
the country has had time to think 
about it. The bureaucratic whiplash 
could be enormous. The economic im-
pact could be enormous of the changing 
policies on regulation and taxes and ev-
erything else in a dramatic way every 
time one side gets some small advan-
tage over the other side. 
For the past year, we have heard a 
constant refrain from our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle that the leg-
islative filibuster—the supermajority 
to move to finalize a piece of legisla-
tion—must be reformed. At the present 
moment, we are hearing it must be re-
formed only, maybe, for elections, that 
we should have a carve-out for elec-
tions. Just a few weeks ago, it had to 
be reformed to have a carve-out for the 
debt ceiling. I am sure, if we had done 
either of those things, in a few weeks, 
we would be talking about a third 
carve-out. And what are we doing it 
for? We are doing it for what I see as a 
federalization of the election process. 
When asked in a Morning Consult/ 
POLITICO poll that was just released 
today—so this is something the Amer-
ican people have just weighed in on 
today. When they were asked which of 
the three voting ideas that were polled 
should be a top priority of the Congress 
in the voting area—one was reforming 
Congress’s role in counting electoral 
votes; one was expanding voting access; 
one was expanding the oversight of the 
State changes in elections—they were 
all beaten by ‘‘none of the above.’’ 
‘‘None of the above’’ got more votes in 
that poll than some of the top prior-
ities 
the 
Democrats 
were 
talking 
about. 
We hear that we have to extend the 
Voting Rights Act. We have even titled 
the Voting Rights Act after a person 
whom I served with in the House, 
whom I traveled with, whom I had a 
close 
friendship 
with—John 
Lewis. 
That would be a good reason for me to 
vote for the Voting Rights Act, and 
certainly I voted to extend the Voting 
Rights Act before. In fact, I would vote 
to extend the Voting Rights Act today, 
and I would even be more happy to vote 
for the Voting Rights Act today if it 
were the Voting Rights Act that just 
happened to be named for John Lewis. 
The Voting Rights Act in 1965 was 12 
pages. The extensions have all been 
about the same size. This bill has an-
other 110 pages of additional legislative 
things that don’t deal with the prin-
ciples of the Voting Rights Act at all; 
they deal with the Federal Govern-
ment’s taking over the election proc-
ess. 
We have seen our colleagues talk 
about this in one bill after another. I 
think the motives are pretty trans-
parent right now; it is another way to 
break the filibuster. But we hear that 
the laws that States are passing—and 
by the way, the States have been pass-
ing election laws for the whole coun-
try, as it relates to their States, for a 
little over 200 years now. The Constitu-
tion was pretty specific as to who 
would conduct elections in the country 
and who would set the rules and regu-
lations in the country for those elec-
tions. 
We hear that these laws are very re-
strictive. Now, mostly, these laws are 
laws that the legislatures leaned for-
ward, as they should have, in my opin-
ion, in a pandemic environment. It was 
an election that, in at least 100 years, 
we had never conducted anything like 
with the pandemic experience we were 
in. So they leaned forward. They al-
lowed things that had never been al-
lowed before: more mail-in voting, vot-
ing from your car, voting from a park-
ing lot, all sorts of things. Then those 
same legislatures looked back at what 
had happened as a result of that and 
said: Do we want to keep all of this as 
if we were going to have a pandemic 
every year or do we want to keep part 
of it? In every case that I have looked

January 12, 2022 
at, the changes in election law made it 
easier to vote in 2021 than it was in the 
last election before the pandemic. 
I would encourage all of my col-
leagues, who are such sudden experts 
on Utah and Iowa and other election 
laws, to look at the 2018 election laws 
and see how they compare. What the 
legislatures did was exactly what you 
would hope they would do—respond to 
a crisis and, when the crisis is over, 
evaluate how much of that we want to 
keep as part of our permanent system 
and how much of it was only in crisis. 
What do these laws do? 
In Utah, the State legislature deter-
mined it would be appropriate for the 
Lieutenant Governor, who is the chief 
election official of Utah, to get the 
names of deceased individuals from the 
Social Security Administration and 
give them to county officials, who 
would take their names off the rolls. 
That is listed as one of the things that 
make it harder to vote—well, harder to 
vote for dead people. That is fine. I, ac-
tually, asked this question in a hearing 
of someone—one of the election-moni-
toring people who said this was dif-
ficult. 
I said: Well, what about that? 
He said: The Social Security Admin-
istration is often wrong. 
Well, if anybody is going to get some-
thing straightened out pretty quickly, 
it would be a living person who no 
longer is getting their Social Security 
check because the Social Security Ad-
ministration had them on a list of peo-
ple who were deceased. What a foolish 
argument that was for that to be a re-
pressive thing. 
In Georgia, the State legislature ad-
justed their mail-in ballot deadline to 
ensure voters who requested mail-in 
ballots got their ballots with enough 
time to cast them. They brought their 
date more in line with the advice of the 
U.S. Postal Service. The truth is that 
lots of States did this. 
States like Georgia and Florida now 
include specific provisions in State law 
that allow for the use of drop boxes. In 
fact, they have to have at least one in 
every county. There were no drop boxes 
in Georgia anywhere before the 2020 
elections. Now there have to be drop 
boxes everywhere, and it has to be un-
derstood where those locations can be 
found. 
States like Iowa and Georgia imple-
mented more early voting days than 
the so-called Freedom to Vote Act 
would require. In fact, these States had 
more days of early voting than many 
States that have Democrat-led legisla-
tures, like New York and Connecticut 
and the President’s home State of 
Delaware. 
They also forgot that many Repub-
lican States, like Arizona, Florida, and 
Georgia, have already implemented no- 
excuse absentee voting. 
I was an election official for 20 years, 
part of that as the chief election offi-
cial in our State, the secretary of 
state. I am absolutely confident that 
nobody takes the security of the elec-
tions and the confidence in the elec-
tions and the ability to register and 
vote in an easy way more seriously 
than people who are directly answer-
able to their neighbors, if they are the 
local official, or to the people who vote 
for them, if they are the State official. 
President Obama said in 2016 that the 
diversity of this statewide system was 
one of the strengths of our system—the 
State-run system—and one of the rea-
sons it would make it really hard for 
any outside entity—any foreign entity, 
any outside group—to truly try to rig a 
national election. 
I have got more to say. I am going to 
submit the rest of my remarks for the 
record. I am sure there will be more 
time to talk about this next week. 
On ballot harvesting, 62 percent of 
people in one poll are opposed to ballot 
harvesting. Ballot harvesting is when 
you ask somebody to give you their 
ballot. You say: I will turn it in for 
you. 
Well, maybe—who would know? 
I will put it in the mail for you. 
Who would know? If it never gets to 
the counting place, it just got lost in 
the mail. 
One of the reasons it might have got-
ten lost in the mail is the ballot har-
vester knows, with almost certainty, 
that the way you marked your ballot is 
not the way the ballot harvester would 
prefer to have the ballots marked. 
Seventy percent of Americans sup-
port voter maintenance. That is elimi-
nated in many ways by the law being 
proposed. 
One proposal even went so far as to 
tell States the kind of paper their bal-
lots would be printed on. If you really 
want to make it easy to impact an 
election, be sure that somebody knows 
the exact paper that every entity in 
America prints their ballots on and 
gets some of that to use to try to di-
vert the election and make the election 
less secure. 
We are going to hear a lot about this 
over the next couple of days. I cer-
tainly would welcome the opportunity 
to have more time, and I am sure I will 
have more time, to talk about what is 
in these bills, both the State bills and 
the Federal bills, as opposed to what 
people are saying is in both bills. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, the Senator from Missouri is ex-
actly right. We are going to hear so 
much about this, and the reason is, as 
the American people hear about this 
so-called election bill, what they are 
realizing is, it is not something that is 
going to make their local election 
safer. It is something that is going to 
put that power in Washington, DC. 
Now, what we are hearing from the 
majority leader and the Democratic 
leadership is that they have got to get 
rid of the filibuster in order to push 
forward 
this 
election 
bill, 
adding 
States, packing courts—all of this 
laundry list of a socialist agenda that 
they are planning to execute. 
So what I want to do today for a cou-
ple of minutes is just walk us down 
memory lane as to what people have 
had to say, what our Democratic col-
leagues have had to say about the fili-
buster. 
In May of 2005, then-Senator Joe 
Biden came to the floor and he vigor-
ously jumped into the middle of a de-
bate over the filibuster. He said that 
things would go very wrong if his col-
leagues decided to blow up the rules to 
get their way. What is interesting 
about Senator Biden’s position is that 
it had almost nothing to do with his 
policy goals. 
Here is his quote: 
Folks who want to see this change want to 
eliminate one of the procedural mechanisms 
designed for the express purpose of guaran-
teeing individual rights, and they also have 
a consequence, and would undermine the pro-
tections of a minority point of view in the 
heat of majority excess. 
He understood, at that point in time, 
the importance of preserving the Sen-
ate’s institutional power and abiding 
by standards that not only welcome 
but require deliberation and com-
promise. 
Well, what a difference a few years 
and a Senate majority can make. 
Today, we are having the exact same 
debate, but the power my Democratic 
colleagues won in the last election has 
changed their minds about breaking 
the Senate to get their way. The prob-
lem is, the Senate is not broken. It 
does not need their changes. 
But the rules no longer matter to the 
majority leader, even though he said as 
recently as 2017: 
[L]et us go no further down this road. I 
hope the Republican leader and I can, in the 
coming months, find a way to build a fire-
wall around the legislative filibuster, which 
is the most important distinction between 
the Senate and the House. Without the 60- 
vote threshold for legislation, the Senate be-
comes a majoritarian institution like the 
House, much more subject to the winds of 
short-term electoral change. 
Well, my, my, my, how about that? 
He understood the dangers of legisla-
tive whiplash, even when he was in the 
minority. So did my colleague Senator 
DURBIN, who said in 2018 that he be-
lieved that ending the filibuster would 
‘‘be the end of the Senate as it was 
originally devised and created, going 
back to our Founding Fathers.’’ 
Well, I am going to ask the Senators 
from New York and Illinois: What hap-
pened here? What changed their minds 
so drastically? They have done a 180. 
I would ask the same question of 
many of my Democratic colleagues. In 
2017, 32 Senate Democrats—yes, that is 
correct, 32, many of whom are still 
serving in this Chamber today—signed 
onto a bipartisan letter in support of 
the filibuster. Now, they, too, have 
changed their minds. It makes you 
wonder: What is everybody on the 
Democratic aisle drinking these days? 
This is no way to run the world’s 
greatest deliberative body, but it is a 
great way to destroy it. Between 2017 
and today, many Senate Democrats

January 12, 2022 
changed their minds about how to han-
dle the filibuster. 
Over the past year, we have watched 
Joe Biden and the Democrats attack 
more than one institution forming the 
foundation of this Nation. The Su-
preme Court, the First Amendment, 
the Second Amendment, limits on the 
power of the Executive, and, now, the 
Senate rules have all proved to be in-
convenient to their agenda and ended 
up on the chopping block. That is 
where they are putting them. 
My Democratic colleagues may be 
frustrated, but that is just too bad. The 
Senate 
was 
not 
designed 
to 
rubberstamp legislation that is so bel-
ligerently foolish it can’t tempt a sin-
gle Republican vote—not one. No. 
The Senate was designed to protect 
the American people and the institu-
tion itself from shortsighted leader-
ship. 
My colleagues claim that all they are 
asking for is one teeny little carve- 
out—just one. But I would remind 
them that there is only so much carv-
ing you can do before you reduce the 
entire thing to dust. And based on their 
track record, we have no reason to 
trust that they will stop carving and 
put down the knife rather than use it 
to hold the Senate hostage the next 
time they can’t scrounge up the votes 
to check something off their to-do list. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, since the founding of our Repub-
lic, the Senate has existed to encour-
age extended debate and protect the 
rights of the minority party. 
Over the centuries, as various polit-
ical parties have risen and fallen from 
power, the Senate’s rules have been re-
spected and followed. One of those 
rules is the legislative filibuster, which 
protects the minority party’s rights by 
requiring a 60-vote threshold to pass 
legislation in the Senate. 
Unfortunately, 
many 
of 
today’s 
Democrats in Washington only care 
about 
one 
thing: 
radically 
trans-
forming this Nation into a new social-
ist state. And they will use any means 
necessary to keep their grip on the 
Federal Government. 
Now we are seeing Democrat leader-
ship in the Congress wield their his-
torically narrow majority to push one 
partisan bill after another without 
even attempting to get Republican 
input or support. Instead of working 
together with their Republican col-
leagues, they are searching for ways to 
make it easier to jam through progres-
sive, socialist policies without any 
compromise. Just look at the majority 
leader’s most recent statements on the 
filibuster. 
Last week, the majority leader wrote 
a letter to all Democrat Senators ex-
plaining his plans to fundamentally 
and permanently alter the rules of the 
U.S. Senate and change the legislative 
filibuster. His statements could not be 
more hypocritical or self-serving. 
The legislative filibuster, which has 
been in place for decades, has been re-
peatedly defended as a vital and nec-
essary rule to protect the minority 
party’s rights, including by Barack 
Obama, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and 
even Senator SCHUMER. 
In 2017, Senator SCHUMER urged then- 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL to ‘‘find a 
way to build a firewall around the leg-
islative filibuster,’’ which is the most 
important distinction between the Sen-
ate and the House. 
He went on to say: 
Without the 60-vote threshold for legisla-
tion, the Senate becomes a majoritarian in-
stitution like the House, much more subject 
to the winds of short-term electoral change. 
No Senator would like to see that happen, so 
let’s find a way to further protect the 60-vote 
rule for legislation. 
These are the direct quotes from the 
Senator from New York. He called the 
filibuster the most important distinc-
tion between the Senate and the House, 
and now he is turning his back on 
them. 
Of course, my colleague from New 
York isn’t the only one caught in a 
bind here by previous statements and 
actions. Just remember that, in 2018, 
the current Senate majority whip, Sen-
ator DICK DURBIN, said doing away with 
the legislative filibuster ‘‘would be the 
end of the Senate as it was originally 
devised and created going back to our 
Founding Fathers.’’ 
He further admitted: ‘‘We have to ac-
knowledge our respect for the minor-
ity, and that is what the Senate tries 
to do in its composition and its proce-
dure.’’ 
Or remember in 2017, when 32 Demo-
crats signed a bipartisan letter urging 
Senate leadership to keep the sacred 
part of the Senate intact. Most of those 
same Senators who defended minority 
party rights are still in office today, 
but only one has expressed any opposi-
tion to Senator SCHUMER’s plans to de-
stroy the filibuster, now that he is in 
the majority. 
And just last Congress, most of the 
Democrat caucus used a filibuster to 
block a police reform bill from my Re-
publican colleague TIM SCOTT and a bill 
that would have protected newborn ba-
bies who survived attempted abortions. 
So my Democrat colleagues think 
the filibuster is great when it works in 
their favor, but they can’t stand it 
when it blocks their radical socialist 
agenda, an agenda we know the Amer-
ican people do not support. 
So why the change of mind? Why are 
they willing to be so blatantly hypo-
critical and so obviously flip-flop? Be-
cause they know if they pull this off 
and pass this radical, dangerous bill to 
federalize elections, it will all but se-
cure their power into the future. That 
is what we are talking about here. 
Democrats want to push through this 
bill that will completely upend our cur-
rent election system, and they are will-
ing to abandon their principles and 
flip-flop on the filibuster if it means 
permanently maintaining power. 
Senator SCHUMER admitted it earlier 
today on MSNBC. He said the quiet 
part out loud and explained that Demo-
crat Senators are saying things like 
‘‘I’ll lose my election’’ or ‘‘We’ll lose 
our majority’’ if they don’t change the 
filibuster to pass their election take-
over bill. 
Democrats say this is about ‘‘voting 
rights.’’ It isn’t. The right to vote is 
more readily accessible and easily ex-
ercised by eligible voters across the 
country than ever before. This is really 
about federalizing our elections and en-
acting policies that they think will 
give them an advantage in future elec-
tions. And all along the way, they will 
revel in their hypocrisy and self-right-
eously pretend that they are ‘‘pro-
tecting democracy.’’ 
But make no mistake, a change to 
the filibuster won’t protect democracy. 
It will ruin it. 
Democrats in this Chamber can pos-
ture all they want, but the American 
people see them for what they really 
are: self-serving, power-hungry politi-
cians. 
We all know that if the Democrats’ 
bill was good, if it included policies 
that would actually improve our Na-
tion’s elections, it would pass. But 
there is nothing in the bill worth vot-
ing for. The Democrats’ bill is an as-
sault on American elections. It will 
fuel voter fraud, waste taxpayer dollars 
on political campaigns and attack ads, 
and make it nearly impossible to con-
duct fair elections that our citizens can 
trust. 
We need an end to this self-serving 
hypocrisy, and we need Members who 
will stand up for what is right. I am 
urging my Democratic colleagues to 
see past their party’s own partisan, 
short-term interests, and I ask them to 
consider the health and future of our 
democracy. That is what the American 
people deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, just 
this week, we saw the College Football 
National Championship game. A lot of 
tremendous athletes engaged in tre-
mendous feats of skill and strength, 
but I have to say, there wasn’t an ath-
lete on the field who demonstrated the 
flexibility that we are seeing in the 
U.S. Senate right now. We are today 
seeing Democrats in the Senate, with 
the active encouragement of President 
Joe Biden, engaging in not one but two 
partisan power grabs and doing them 
both with a twist. Let me explain. 
Democrats are desperate to hold on 
to power. It is their No. 1 priority. It is 
more important than anything else. It 
is more important than jobs and our 
economy to Democrats. It is more im-
portant than getting kids back to 
school. It is more important than de-
feating COVID. Nothing matters more 
to today’s Democrats than staying in 
power no matter what. 
How do we know that? Well, the very 
first bill introduced in the House of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S174 
January 12, 2022 
Representatives, H.R. 1, is a bill many 
of us call the ‘‘Corrupt Politicians 
Act.’’ It is a bill designed to keep 
Democrats in power forever. That was 
NANCY PELOSI’s No. 1 priority. 
The very first bill introduced in this 
Chamber, S. 1, is likewise the ‘‘Corrupt 
Politicians Act,’’ a bill designed to 
keep Democrats in power forever. It is 
the No. 1 priority of elected Democrats. 
When that failed to get sufficient 
votes to pass, Democrats shifted to op-
tion 1B. Option 1B has the same objec-
tive—keep Democrats in power for-
ever—but it is through a little twist, a 
sleight of hand. Now, Democrats want 
to subject every significant decision 
concerning 
voting 
to 
the 
unreviewable—in most instances—arbi-
trary power of an unelected bureaucrat 
in the Federal Department of Justice. 
My State of Texas has 29 million peo-
ple. Those 29 million people have demo-
cratic rights. They have rights to elect 
legislatures that reflect their views, 
their policies, their values. Do you 
know what Senate Democrats say? We 
don’t care. We don’t care what those 29 
million people want; we, the Demo-
crats, want to stay in power. 
So let’s take, for example, photo ID. 
I have in my wallet my driver’s license. 
Most people do. Voter ID is a policy 
that is supported by the overwhelming 
majority of Americans. Roughly 80 per-
cent of Americans support voter ID, re-
quiring a driver’s license to vote. Two- 
thirds of African-American voters sup-
port voter ID. It is overwhelmingly 
supported across the country. 
Do you know who doesn’t support it? 
Elected Democrats. Sadly, every single 
Democrat in this Chamber has been 
willing to go on board with proposals 
to strike down voter ID laws. Here is 
what the Democrats want to do: They 
want to say that even though the vot-
ers of Texas want voter ID because we 
want elections with integrity—we want 
to know that if you come in and vote 
and say your name is John Doe, that 
you are not somebody else pretending 
to be that person—congressional Demo-
crats don’t care. They want to have an 
unelected bureaucrat with the ability 
to strike that down—and likewise with 
ballot harvesting. 
Ballot harvesting is one of the most 
corrupt practices in this country. It is 
the practice whereby paid political 
operatives go and collect the ballots of 
other people. So, for example, you have 
a young operative from the DNC come 
into a nursing home and go room to 
room. Now, some of those residents 
may no longer be competent to make a 
choice. They may not be aware of their 
surroundings. But for an unscrupulous 
operative, that doesn’t stop them. That 
operative can sit there and say: Sir or 
ma’am, you want to vote for so-and-so, 
don’t you? They can fill out the ballot 
for them. 
Do you know what? If there is some 
obstreperous senior in a nursing home 
who says, ‘‘Gosh, I really want to vote 
for the other guy,’’ well, it is very sim-
ple for the unscrupulous operative to 
take that ballot—ah, this ballot is for 
the other guy—and magically it ends 
up in the trash, never gets mailed in. 
They can just mail in the ballots they 
agree with and throw away the ballots 
they disagree with. 
There is a reason the majority of 
States have made ballot harvesting il-
legal: It invites voter fraud. By the 
way, it wasn’t long ago when people on 
both sides of the aisle recognized this. 
The most significant bipartisan ef-
fort examining voter fraud: the study 
of a bipartisan Commission called the 
Carter-Baker Commission. Baker is 
former Republican Secretary of State 
James Baker. Carter is former Demo-
cratic President Jimmy Carter. The 
Carter-Baker 
Commission 
concluded 
that voter ID was an important step to 
stopping voter fraud. The Carter-Baker 
Commission concluded that voter fraud 
was a real and significant problem un-
dermining the integrity of elections. 
The Carter-Baker Commission identi-
fied ballot harvesting as one of the 
most dangerous practices encouraging 
voter fraud. 
As I said, the Carter in Carter-Baker 
Commission was former Democratic 
President 
Jimmy 
Carter—hardly 
a 
rightwing Republican operative by any 
stretch of the imagination. 
It used to be, when sanity was per-
missible in the Democratic Party, that 
people would acknowledge the obvious. 
Unfortunately, we are in hyperpartisan 
times. So, today, Senate Democrats 
want to be able to have laws on voter 
ID, want to have laws prohibiting bal-
lot harvesting struck down by one 
unelected bureaucrat. 
By the way, who is that bureaucrat? 
Currently, 
it 
is 
a 
woman 
named 
Kristen Clarke, head of the Civil 
Rights Division at the Department of 
Justice. Ms. Clarke is one of the most 
radical, partisan nominees ever to 
serve in the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice. She is one of the leading advo-
cates in the country for abolishing the 
police. 
By the way, every single Democrat in 
this Chamber voted to confirm her de-
spite the fact that she is one of the 
leading advocates in the country for 
abolishing the police. She has been a 
hardcore, leftwing, partisan advocate 
her entire life. 
Now, she is entitled to have her 
views. She is entitled to believe those 
views passionately. But here is what 
Senate Democrats want to do: They 
want to take this one person and say 
she can strike down the laws adopted 
by legislatures elected by 29 million 
Texans. That is extraordinary. 
Now, what could justify such a thing? 
Well, we saw Joe Biden give an incred-
ibly demagogic, racist speech accusing 
half the country of being racist, of 
being Bull Connor. 
The Democrats say this is Jim Crow 
2.0. You know, Madam President, iron-
ically and I think inadvertently, the 
Democrats are telling the truth. They 
don’t mean to be, but they are. What 
was Jim Crow 1.0? Jim Crow 1.0 was 
laws that were written almost exclu-
sively by elected Democrats. If you 
look at the authors of Jim Crow, they 
were Democrats, as were the founders 
of the Ku Klux Klan. The purpose of 
Jim Crow laws was to do one thing: 
stop the voters from voting Democrats 
out of office because, if you look at the 
African Americans who were freed from 
slavery, they were electing Repub-
licans. In many instances, they were 
electing Black Republicans. And the 
Democrats didn’t want that. How dare 
the voters select someone not from 
their party. So Jim Crow was written 
to strip the right to vote from the vot-
ers who dared to vote against Demo-
crats. 
Well, fast-forward to today. The 
‘‘Corrupt Politicians Act’’ is Jim Crow 
2.0. It is once again written by Demo-
crats to strip the right to vote from 
the American people to prevent them 
from voting Democrats out of office. 
Listen, a lot of Democrats are really 
nervous right now. Pretty much every-
one in Washington recognizes that in 
November, we are going to see a wave 
election. Pretty much everyone in 
Washington understands that in No-
vember, Republicans are going to re-
take the House of Representatives, 
probably by a big margin, and there is 
a very good possibility we will retake 
the Senate as well. 
Democrats can’t defend their poli-
cies. They can’t defend the rampant in-
flation that is hammering seniors and 
working-class people across the coun-
try. They can’t defend the chaos at the 
open borders. They can’t defend the 
jobs being destroyed. They can’t defend 
the lawless and abusive vaccine man-
dates. And they certainly can’t defend 
their catastrophic surrender and fail-
ure in Afghanistan. 
It has gotten so bad that when Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS went down 
to 
the 
State 
of 
Georgia, 
Stacey 
Abrams, the Democratic candidate run-
ning for Governor in Georgia—and, I 
would note, Stacey Abrams still main-
tains to this day she won the last elec-
tion. She insists the last election was 
stolen and she is the sitting Governor. 
Apparently this is a reelect campaign. 
Stacey Abrams refused to show up, to 
be seen with Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS. Even while Biden was giving 
this racially demagogic speech, which 
Stacey Abrams has made a career of 
doing, Ms. Abrams did not show up for 
the speech. She said she had a sched-
uling conflict. 
The Presiding Officer and I have both 
served some time in the Senate. We 
have both seen instances where the 
President of the United States was vis-
iting our home States. I can tell you, 
as a Senator, you make time to be 
there if you want to be there. It is 
clear that Ms. Abrams did not want to 
be there, that she looked at Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS and sees their poll 
numbers plummeting, she sees their 
policies failing, and she wanted to be 
nowhere near that. 
So what is the Democrats’ approach? 
If they can’t win on the merits, if they

S175 
January 12, 2022 
can’t defend their policy failures, if 
they can’t convince the voters, then 
let’s go back to the Jim Crow policies 
the Democrats authored to begin with. 
This is Jim Crow 2.0: Strip away the 
power of the voters to make a choice, 
put an unelected bureaucrat in charge 
of election laws, and throw out the de-
cisions of 29 million Texans. 
I will tell the Presiding Officer this: 
Democrats don’t get to claim they are 
defending democracy when they are lit-
erally taking away the rights of demo-
cratically elected legislatures. That is 
many things, but it ain’t democracy. 
One unelected bureaucrat overruling 29 
million Texans is not democracy; it is 
a power grab. 
But I told you this was a power grab 
on top of a power grab with a twist. 
The second power grab is, how are they 
going to try to pass the ‘‘Corrupt Poli-
ticians Act’’? They are going to do it 
by nuking the filibuster. 
The rules of the Senate written in 
that book that sits on the dais in front 
of you say that to proceed to legisla-
tion takes 60 votes in this Senate. It 
takes 60 percent of the Senators. Those 
are the Senate rules. They are black 
and white. They are clear. If you don’t 
like the Senate rules, there is a way to 
change that. You can amend the Sen-
ate rules. It takes 67 votes to amend 
the Senate rules. 
A number of us have proposed amend-
ing the Senate rules. I myself have re-
peatedly gone to Democrats saying I 
would be happy to work with Demo-
crats on proposals to amend the Senate 
rules to allow Senators on both sides to 
offer more amendments. Democrats 
haven’t been willing to do so. Instead, 
what Democrats intend to do—what 
they want to do, what President Biden 
is urging them to do—is to break the 
Senate rules, to change the Senate 
rules. It is called nuking the filibuster. 
If their plan is successful, Senator 
SCHUMER will stand up and seek a rul-
ing from the Chair as to whether it 
takes 60 votes or 50 votes to proceed to 
legislation. 
The Chair will say—if the Chair is 
following the rules—it takes 60 votes. 
And then Senator SCHUMER will move 
to reconsider the ruling of the Chair 
and overrule the ruling of the Chair 
and say: Even though the words on the 
page say 60 votes, from now on it is 50. 
It is another brazen power grab. 
There may be some folks at home 
who are a little cynical of the partisan 
time we find ourselves in, who are 
skeptical of claims, perhaps, made by 
both sides. But maybe you are a Demo-
crat at home. And I am a Republican. 
I am a conservative Republican. You 
might be saying: Do you know what? If 
it is CRUZ saying it, I am a Democrat; 
I don’t believe him. 
I understand this. This is a very par-
tisan time. There are a lot of disagree-
ments. So if you are a Democrat at 
home and you are inclined not to be-
lieve what I say, I am going to suggest, 
perhaps, some people you can believe. 
I told you it was a double power grab 
with a twist. I want to point to you the 
words of President Joe Biden. If you 
are not inclined to believe a Repub-
lican, maybe you will believe Joe 
Biden. Here is what Joe Biden said in 
2019. This is not 1964. This is not 1954— 
2019, a couple of years ago. ‘‘Ending the 
filibuster is a very dangerous move.’’ 
If you are at home and don’t believe 
Republicans, do you believe Joe Biden? 
Was he lying when he said ‘‘Ending the 
filibuster is a very dangerous move’’ or 
was he telling the truth? Because that 
is what Joe Biden said just a couple of 
years ago. 
Now, maybe you say: Well, he was on 
a campaign. People say things. You 
can’t hold him to fault for saying that. 
That is not fair. 
OK, all right, so now you don’t be-
lieve me, and you don’t believe Joe 
Biden. But let’s see if we can find 
someone else. How about someone who 
serves in this Chamber right now? How 
about someone who is the Senate ma-
jority leader right now? How about 
Senator CHUCK SCHUMER? 
If you haven’t actually watched this 
speech, I would encourage you to go 
pull out your phone and Google it. You 
can find it really easily. Senator CHUCK 
SCHUMER, in 2005, gave a speech. I am 
going read to you verbatim what he 
said. He said: ‘‘They want, because 
they can’t get their way . . . to change 
the rules midstream.’’ 
What would be the effect of that? 
You change the rules midstream. You 
nuke the filibuster. What would be the 
effect of that? According to CHUCK 
SCHUMER, the effect of that is ‘‘to wash 
away 200 years of history.’’ That is 
what SCHUMER
says is the effect. 
‘‘Washing away 200 years of history’’— 
that sound serious. 
Anything else? 
‘‘They want to make this country 
into a banana republic, where if you 
don’t get your way, you change the 
rules’’—‘‘wash away 200 years of his-
tory . . . make this country into a ba-
nana republic.’’ 
That is pretty serious stuff. That 
ought to concern us. But at least that 
is the worst it gets, right? Well, actu-
ally, no. SCHUMER continued: ‘‘It’ll be 
doomsday for democracy if we do.’’ 
There are reporters teeming the U.S. 
Capitol. Any reporter who wants to be 
something other than a partisan shill 
and mouthpiece for the Democrats 
ought to ask every single Democrat: 
Senator so-and-so, do you agree with 
CHUCK SCHUMER that ending the fili-
buster will turn our Nation into a ba-
nana republic? Do you agree, Senator 
so-and-so, that ending the filibuster 
would be doomsday for democracy? 
And, by the way, if there are any re-
porters left who actually have journal-
istic ethics, you shouldn’t just ask JOE 
MANCHIN and KYRSTEN SINEMA. Right 
now, they are the lone Democrats with 
the gumption to stand up for democ-
racy. But you ought to ask all 50 of 
them, every single one of the Demo-
crats: Do you agree with CHUCK SCHU-
MER
that ending the filibuster is 
doomsday for democracy? And if not, 
why? Is it just that your team is the 
one that can’t get their way? Now it is 
your side that wants to change the 
rules midstream. Now it is your side 
that, if you don’t get your way, you 
change the rules. 
Was Joe Biden lying in 2019? Was 
Senator SCHUMER lying in 2005? I don’t 
know. You ought to ask them. A double 
power grab with a twist: Jim Crow 2.0, 
seizing 
Federal 
elections, 
striking 
down the laws adopted by democratic 
legislatures, putting an unelected rad-
ical leftist bureaucrat in charge of 
elections with more power—this one 
leftist bureaucrat—than all 29 million 
people in the State of Texas, doing so 
by breaking the Senate rules to change 
the rules. And the twist is with a dose 
of hypocrisy—unusual even for this 
place. 
Look, 
if 
a 
Senator 
serves 
long 
enough, there will be times when they 
may vote a little bit this way or a lit-
tle bit that way. There are lots of Sen-
ators that have had tensions with prior 
positions. I cannot think of another 
time when a Senator has voted for 
something that he has called ‘‘dooms-
day for democracy.’’ That is not just a 
little hypocritical. And, by the way, all 
the Democrats agreed with him. They 
were all standing shoulder to shoulder. 
In 2005, when Senator SCHUMER said 
this, he was either lying or telling the 
truth. If he was lying, I guess you 
should ask him why he was lying. If he 
was telling the truth, I guess you 
should ask 48 Democrats who don’t 
care why they are willing to vote for 
doomsday for democracy. 
If you want to understand the dan-
gers of this double power grab with a 
twist, look no further than the vicious, 
partisan, divisive, hateful speech Presi-
dent Biden gave, insulting half this 
country; oddly enough, blaming Repub-
licans for the sins of his own party— 
the Democratic Party—who wrote Jim 
Crow and founded the KKK. 
All of us were sitting outside the 
Capitol when President Biden gave his 
inauguration speech, when he talked 
about unity, when he talked about 
healing. Do you want to see the vicious 
partisanship that ending the filibuster 
will produce? You saw it. A double 
power grab, with a twist of hypocrisy. 
If there is a Democrat in this Cham-
ber who gives a damn about democ-
racy, let me urge you: Don’t vote for 
what your own leader has called 
‘‘doomsday for democracy.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, the Sen-
ate is, indeed, a peculiar institution. 
Despite what some might expect, and 
despite how it might be portrayed from 
the outside, Senators genuinely strive 
to be collegial, even when—especially 
when—they hold strong political and 
policy disagreements. In fact, the Sen-
ate rules have strict prohibitions on in-
sulting the character of another Mem-
ber or a State. That is because debate 
is a fundamental part of the Senate. I

S176 
January 12, 2022 
mean, it is part of our culture in this 
institution. That is how this institu-
tion earned the moniker as the world’s 
greatest deliberative body. 
Some in this body, unfortunately, 
want to change all that. They seek to 
trample over more than two centuries 
of precedent, procedure, and politeness. 
They are attempting to break the rules 
that 
require 
a 
two-thirds 
super-
majority—67 
votes—to 
change 
the 
rules. They want to ignore that re-
quirement and stiff-arm this historic 
institution in a way that would oblit-
erate the requirement that those in the 
majority hear the voices of and work 
with those in the minority. 
That 
requirement—sometimes 
colloquially referred to as the fili-
buster—is one of the most powerful 
constraints or checks on human na-
ture, not only in the Senate but in the 
entirety of the U.S. Government. If the 
filibuster were removed, everything 
from 
regulatory 
structures to tax 
rates, the size of the Supreme Court, 
the makeup of the military, the crimi-
nal code, and much, much more could 
change drastically every few years. 
Keeping track of the law and its fluc-
tuating requirements would be impos-
sible for the most capable of lawyers, 
let alone the average American subject 
to all those laws. Our business land-
scape would be obliterated under the 
ever-changing commands of the Fed-
eral Government. Americans would be 
worse off in almost every sense I can 
think of. In countless ways, the Amer-
ican people would be harmed by this 
unfortunate decision. 
Our system is designed specifically to 
control those whims and those pas-
sions, to make sure that their impact 
on the law doesn’t cause the law to be-
come this ever-changing, ever-fluc-
tuating creature that can’t be antici-
pated. 
Our Constitution was designed to 
protect the rights, the voices, and the 
influence of those not in the majority. 
Laws that significantly impact the 
lives of hundreds of millions of people 
should, in fact, be difficult to pass. 
In fact, the Senate has applied these 
principles into almost every mecha-
nism of the institution. Most laws pass 
by unanimous consent or by simple 
voice vote after hearty consideration 
and frequent amendments through a 
process known as the hotline. That 
would essentially cease to function if 
the minority had no significant influ-
ence. Opportunities for amending these 
often smaller and somewhat less con-
troversial bills would be foreclosed, 
crippling 
the 
careful 
consideration 
needed. Bills would have to be forced 
through often on party-line votes over 
the objection, suspicion, or protest of 
the minority. 
But beyond building consensus and 
maintaining the function of the Sen-
ate, the filibuster serves as the keel on 
a very large ship. It prevents the waves 
and passions of each new election from 
drastically changing the laws of the 
country. It is a stabilizer of sorts, one 
that prevents our Nation’s course from 
being jerked around to oscillating ex-
tremes. 
I was asked recently if the Senate is 
broken. I responded by saying that the 
only sense in which I think the Senate 
is significantly broken, or at least un-
dermined in the way that it is supposed 
to operate, is in its neglect of sub-
stantive debate and opportunities for 
amendments for each individual Mem-
ber. The filibuster protects the remain-
ing debate, amendment, and consider-
ation available to Members of this 
body, whether those Members are of 
the majority party or of the minority 
party. 
So removing the filibuster, on the 
other hand, would irreparably render 
the Senate beyond recognition. The 
partisan vitriol and disregard for op-
posing Senators would eat away at this 
place, at our norms, our customs, and, 
ultimately, our Republic. 
Now, at least until recently, many 
Senate Democrats—most, in fact—held 
these beliefs as well. In 2017, 27 of 
them, including now-Vice President 
HARRIS, signed a letter urging the pres-
ervation of the filibuster. Many of 
those Members still serve today, and I 
encourage them to consider their past 
advice. 
By the way, that was a letter I 
signed, along with nearly every Mem-
ber of the Senate from the Republican 
Party. We signed on to that notwith-
standing the fact that Republicans held 
majorities in the Senate and in the 
House and a Republican President was 
serving in the White House. We did so 
because even though some short-term 
gain could have been achieved by 
nuking the filibuster then, we all un-
derstood what I think we still all un-
derstand today, which is that it would 
inflict irreparable harm on the Senate, 
and even more than the Senate, on 
those represented here. It would irrep-
arably harm the American people to do 
away with it. 
Senator SCHUMER, the leader of this 
destructive current effort, has himself 
in the past given grave, dire warnings 
about what this tactic—making the fil-
ibuster a thing of the past—would 
mean. We heard many quotes today, 
and in one that sticks out in my mind 
in particular, he said that attempts 
like that to nuke the filibuster are 
‘‘what we call abuse of power.’’ He also 
said in that same quote that even if 
you have 51 percent of the vote, you 
still don’t get your way 100 percent of 
the time. He is absolutely right. That 
describes the Senate, it describes its 
rules, and it describes so much about 
how our system of government works. 
It even describes the system of checks 
and balances built into our Constitu-
tion. 
The vertical protection of federalism 
says many of our laws—in fact, most of 
them—are supposed to be made at the 
State and local level and not within 
Washington, and the horizontal protec-
tion—that of federalism—says that we 
are going to have one branch that 
makes the laws, one that enforces 
them, and one that interprets them. 
In that same document, it gives both 
Chambers of Congress the authority to 
set our own rules. Even though the 60- 
vote cloture standard is not itself man-
dated by the Constitution, the author-
ity to add it, to adopt it, as the Senate 
has, is in the Constitution, and its 
ends, more importantly, are entirely 
consistent with this principle of checks 
and balances, with this notion that 
Senator SCHUMER eloquently referred 
to. The mere fact that you have 51 per-
cent of the vote doesn’t entitle you to 
get your way 100 percent of the time. 
Now, this circumstance is particularly 
poignant given that he doesn’t even 
have 51 percent of the votes in this 
Chamber, no. This is deadlocked 50 to 
50. 
He is also right that this is what we 
call an abuse of power. Indeed, break-
ing the rules to grab power is an abuse. 
This attempt is so transparent that 
even Senator SCHUMER
has told the 
media that his Members are concerned 
about losing their elections and the 
majority if they can’t use this tactic to 
federally take over our election sys-
tem. It is sad, it is tragic, and it is un-
acceptable. 
I warn them that the American peo-
ple see through this ploy. They know 
what is happening, and they know why. 
They were promised a return to cordial 
statesmanship. They were promised 
unity. This attempt mocks both of 
these promises. It mocks the U.S. Sen-
ate. It mocks our system of checks and 
balances. Most tragically, it mocks the 
American people. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, first, 
I would like to wish a very happy and 
healthy new year to you and to all of 
our staff and pages who make the Sen-
ate run so efficiently every single day 
and frequently late into the night. The 
world’s most deliberative body has un-
predictable hours, which all too often 
means missing important events with 
family because we are here going back 
and forth on the pressing issues of the 
day. 
This is why we have a Senate, after 
all—to give voice to the various view-
points of Americans from each State 
and then try to resolve those dif-
ferences. It isn’t always easy since, un-
like the House of Representatives, the 
Senate’s unique rules require us to 
work together across party lines. 
I know what it is like to work with 
my Democratic friends. In fact, I was 
named as one of the most bipartisan 
Senators of either party in the past 25 
years. That is what it takes to get 
things done here because the rules 
force us to reach consensus. 
The Senate was created specifically 
to prevent a mob rule mentality. 
James Madison, the father of the Con-
stitution, described the Senate as the 
‘‘anchor’’ of the Federal Government 
that would act as a ‘‘necessary fence 
against fickleness and passion.’’ George

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S177 
January 12, 2022 
Washington famously said that the 
Senate was established to cool legisla-
tion passed by the House in the same 
way that a saucer cools hot tea. 
Folks, we certainly have seen a lot of 
hot mess coming over from the House. 
It is very concerning that the saucer 
intended to cool heated passions is 
itself beginning to boil over as a result 
of hot air from within. 
Senate Democrats are threatening to 
blow up the Senate to fundamentally 
change the U.S. Senate and to radi-
cally transform our country. It cannot 
be understated how detrimental this 
action would be to America. It would 
unravel two centuries of American rep-
resentative democracy. It would si-
lence millions of Americans and de-
stroy what comity remains within this 
body. 
I have to ask my colleagues, which 
side of history do you want to be on? 
Do you want to go down in history 
books as the ones who turned the Sen-
ate, the world’s most deliberative body, 
into the House of Representatives? 
The law of our land would dramati-
cally sway back and forth, and the re-
sulting political uncertainty would all 
but erase what little trust the people 
have in our governing institutions and 
lead to even greater political divisions. 
I don’t think this is a future any of us 
want and certainly not the one that 
was promised by President Biden when 
he pledged—when he pledged—to the 
American people not to divide but to 
unify our country. 
When the threat of blowing up the 
Senate arose during Mr. Biden’s time 
in this institution, he spoke passion-
ately against it. I don’t often quote Joe 
Biden, but I would urge you all to lis-
ten to his full speech on the matter. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have his speech printed in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD following 
my remarks. 
Then-Senator Biden warned: 
History will judge us harshly, in my view, 
if we eliminate over 200 years of precedent 
and procedure in this body and, I might add, 
doing it by breaking a second rule of the 
Senate, and that is changing the rules of the 
Senate by a mere majority vote. 
Senator Biden concluded: 
This nuclear option is ultimately an exam-
ple of the arrogance of power. It is a funda-
mental power grab by the majority party. 
Flash-forward 17 years later. Joe 
Biden is still in Washington, and he 
and his Democratic counterparts are 
the ones who are exercising that arro-
gance of power. 
Now as the President, Biden just yes-
terday declared: 
We have no option but to change the Sen-
ate rules, including getting rid of the fili-
buster. 
So how and why are we at a point 
where nuking the Senate could even be 
a possibility? Plain and simple: The 
Democratic leader, who has partici-
pated in hundreds of filibusters over 
the past 5 years—hundreds, folks; hun-
dreds—wants to have his way regard-
less of the longstanding rules of this 
institution, the viewpoints of other 
Senators, or even, folks—get this—the 
wishes of the citizens of his own State. 
Just last week, the Democratic lead-
er said the filibuster was being used to 
‘‘embarrass the will of majority,’’ and 
therefore ‘‘the Senate will debate and 
consider changes to the Senate rules on 
or before January 17.’’ 
Folks, it is not the Senate rules em-
barrassing the majority but, rather, 
their two-sided flip-flopping on the im-
portance of the filibuster to this insti-
tution and to our democracy. 
Not so long ago, the Democratic lead-
er said that eliminating the filibuster 
would turn ‘‘the cooling saucer of de-
mocracy into the rubber stamp of dic-
tatorship.’’ It will be ‘‘a doomsday for 
democracy.’’ Today, he is the one with 
the finger on the nuclear button, all 
because he can’t get his way. 
This is the kind of power grab you 
would expect from tyrants in socialist 
nations, who seem to be where the 
Democrats are taking many of their 
cues from these days. Tyranny is no 
way to run a democracy, and destroy-
ing the U.S. Senate for a power grab is 
certainly not the example we should be 
setting for the rest of the world. 
But the hypocrisy doesn’t end there, 
folks. Democrats are manufacturing 
hysteria 
that 
Republican-controlled 
States are placing what they consider 
‘‘unfair restrictions’’ on voting as an 
excuse to blow up the Senate and 
thereby clear a pathway for the rest of 
their radical liberal agenda. The irony 
here is that New York, home of the 
Democratic leader, CHUCK
SCHUMER, 
and 
Delaware, 
home 
of 
President 
Biden, have some of the most restric-
tive absentee voting laws in the entire 
country. 
Just this past November, the Demo-
cratic leader’s constituents—his con-
stituents—overwhelmingly voted down 
a ballot initiative to allow absentee 
voting without providing an excuse and 
another proposal to permit unregis-
tered voters from registering and then 
voting on election day. They were 
voted down—his constituents. So in 
New York, the only way to qualify for 
an absentee ballot is to be out of the 
country or sick or have a physical dis-
ability. No other reasons are per-
mitted. 
Now the senior Senator from New 
York is threatening to destroy the Sen-
ate to override the wishes of the resi-
dents of his very own State who voted 
against the policies he is trying to im-
pose on every other State. Did you 
catch that, folks? He is overriding the 
will of the people in his own State. 
Does that sound like democracy to 
you? It is not Senate Republicans 
blocking the Democrat leader’s agenda; 
it is his own constituents. 
Folks, the reality is, this election 
takeover bill is just the beginning, 
used as an excuse by the majority lead-
er to then break the Senate and 
strengthen his own grip on power. 
This party boss mentality may work 
in New York, but, folks, the Senate is 
not 
Tammany 
Hall. 
While 
Senate 
Democrats would have you believe Re-
publicans are somehow limiting the 
rights of Americans to vote, they, in 
fact, are the ones plotting to silence 
millions of Americans. 
The same partisans on the other side 
of the aisle who ‘‘boasted’’ of—air 
quotes 
right 
here, 
folks, 
you 
see 
them—they ‘‘boasted’’ just about a 
year ago of resisting. Just a year ago, 
they were encouraging resisting; fili-
bustering and blocking just about 
every proposal or nominee put forth by 
the prior President. 
Now they call this tool a threat to 
democracy. Remember, less than 2 
years ago, following the very tragic 
death of George Floyd, the Senator 
from New York voted to block consid-
eration of a police reform bill put for-
ward by my friend Senator TIM SCOTT 
of South Carolina. 
That is just one of the many other 
examples of commonsense bills the 
Democrats blocked for purely partisan 
reasons. 
The real threat to democracy isn’t 
the filibuster but those politicians who 
abuse the power with which they have 
been entrusted. The Democratic leader 
has already put a choke hold on democ-
racy right here in the Senate, abusing 
his position to singlehandedly block 
other Senators from offering amend-
ments to bills he chooses to bring to 
the floor. 
If the majority wants to demonstrate 
a commitment to democracy, why not 
start right here in the Senate? Instead 
of threatening to have less delibera-
tion, why not commit to more? Let’s 
bring up bills that have already had 
broad bipartisan support, and let’s 
allow more votes on amendments. 
But rather than starting this new 
year with a resolution to take this ap-
proach and make the Senate a true ex-
ample of democracy in action, where 
every voice is heard and respected, the 
Democratic leader penned each of us a 
bombastic letter written with the left’s 
usual dramatic flair and theatrics, 
comparing the filibuster to a dead hand 
and promising to permanently alter 
the Senate unless we bend to his wish-
es. 
The senior Senator from New York 
should leave the theater for Broadway, 
where it belongs. And before casting a 
vote that could fundamentally change 
the Senate forever, I would urge my 
Democratic colleagues to take some 
advice about the intended behavior of 
the Senate from our Nation’s greatest 
statesman, George Washington, and 
cool it. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
VOL. 151, NO. 69—MAY 23, 2005 
Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my friends and 
colleagues, I have not been here as long as 
Senator Byrd, and no one fully understands 
the Senate as well as Senator Byrd, but I 
have been here for over three decades. This is 
the single most significant vote any one of

S178

us will cast in my 32 years in the Senate. I 
suspect the Senator would agree with that. 
We should make no mistake. This nuclear 
option is ultimately an example of the arro-
gance of power. It is a fundamental power 
grab by the majority party, propelled by its 
extreme right and designed to change the 
reading of the Constitution, particularly as 
it relates to individual rights and property 
rights. It is nothing more or nothing less. 
Let me take a few moments to explain that. 
Folks who want to see this change want to 
eliminate one of the procedural mechanisms 
designed for the express purpose of guaran-
teeing individual rights, and they also have 
a consequence, and would undermine the pro-
tections of a minority point of view in the 
heat of majority excess. We have been 
through these periods before in American 
history but never, to the best of my knowl-
edge, has any party been so bold as to fun-
damentally attempt to change the structure 
of this body. 
Why else would the majority party at-
tempt one of the most fundamental changes 
in the 216-year history of this Senate on the 
grounds that they are being denied ten of 218 
Federal judges, three of whom have stepped 
down? What shortsightedness, and what a 
price history will exact on those who support 
this radical move. 
It is important we state frankly, if for no 
other reason than the historical record, why 
this is being done. The extreme right of the 
Republican Party is attempting to hijack 
the Federal courts by emasculating the 
courts’ independence and changing one of the 
unique foundations of the Senate; that is, 
the requirement for the protection of the 
right of individual Senators to guarantee the 
independence of the Federal Judiciary. 
This is being done in the name of fairness? 
Quite frankly, it is the ultimate act of un-
fairness to alter the unique responsibility of 
the Senate and to do so by breaking the very 
rules of the Senate. 
Mark my words, what is at stake here is 
not the politics of 2005, but the Federal Judi-
ciary in the country in the year 2025. This is 
the single most significant vote, as I said 
earlier, that I will have cast in my 32 years 
in the Senate. The extreme Republican right 
has made Federal appellate Judge Douglas 
Ginsburg’s ‘‘Constitution in Exile’’ frame-
work their top priority. 
It is their purpose to reshape the Federal 
courts so as to guarantee a reading of the 
Constitution consistent with Judge Gins-
burg’s radical views of the fifth amendment’s 
taking clause, the nondelegation doctrine, 
the 11th amendment, and the 10th amend-
ment. I suspect some listening to me and 
some of the press will think I am exag-
gerating. I respectfully suggest they read 
Judge Ginsburg’s ideas about the ‘‘Constitu-
tion in Exile.’’ Read it and understand what 
is at work here. 
If anyone doubts what I am saying, I sug-
gest you ask yourself the rhetorical ques-
tion, Why, for the first time since 1789, is the 
Republican-controlled Senate attempting to 
change the rule of unlimited debate, elimi-
nate it, as it relates to Federal judges for the 
circuit court or the Supreme Court? 
If you doubt what I said, please read what 
Judge Ginsburg has written and listen to 
what Michael Greve of the American Enter-
prise Institute has said: 
I think what is really needed here is a fun-
damental intellectual assault on the entire 
New Deal edifice. We want to withdraw judi-
cial support for the entire modern welfare 
state. 
Read: Social Security, workmen’s comp. 
Read: National Labor Relations Board. Read: 
FDA. Read: What all the byproduct of that 
shift in constitutional philosophy that took 
place in the 1930s meant. 
We are going to hear more about what I 
characterize as radical view—maybe it is un-
fair to say radical—a fundamental view and 
what, at the least, must be characterized as 
a stark departure from current constitu-
tional jurisprudence. Click on to American 
Enterprise Institute Web site www.aei.org. 
Read what they say. Read what the purpose 
is. It is not about seeking a conservative 
court or placing conservative Justices on the 
bench. The courts are already conservative. 
Seven of the nine Supreme Court Justices 
appointed by Republican Presidents Nixon, 
Ford, Reagan, and Bush 1—seven of nine. Ten 
of 13 Federal circuit courts of appeal domi-
nated by Republican appointees, appointed 
by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush 1, 
and Bush 2; 58 percent of the circuit court 
judges appointed by Presidents Nixon, Ford, 
Reagan, Bush 1, or Bush 2. No, my friends 
and colleagues, this is not about building a 
conservative court. We already have a con-
servative court. This is about guaranteeing a 
Supreme Court made up of men and women 
such as those who sat on the Court in 1910 
and 1920. Those who believe, as Justice Jan-
ice Rogers Brown of California does, that the 
Constitution has been in exile since the New 
Deal. 
My friends and colleagues, the nuclear op-
tion is not an isolated instance. It is part of 
a broader plan to pack the court with fun-
damentalist judges and to cower existing 
conservative judges to toe the extreme party 
line. 
You all heard what Tom DeLay said after 
the Federal courts refused to bend to the 
whip of the radical right in the Schiavo case. 
Mr. DeLay declared: ‘‘The time will come for 
men responsible for this to answer for their 
behavior.’’ 
Even current conservative Supreme Court 
Justices are looking over their shoulder, 
with one extremist recalling the despicable 
slogan of Joseph Stalin—and I am not mak-
ing this up—in reference to a Reagan Repub-
lican appointee, Justice Kennedy, when he 
said: ‘‘No man, no problem’’—absent his 
presence, we have no problem. 
Let me remind you, as I said, Justice Ken-
nedy was appointed by President Reagan. 
Have they never heard of the independence 
of the judiciary—as fundamental a part of 
our constitutional system of checks and bal-
ances as there is today; which is literally the 
envy of the entire world, and the fear of the 
extremist part of the world? An independent 
judiciary is their greatest fear. 
Why are radicals focusing on the court? 
Well, first of all, it is their time to be in ab-
solute political control. It is like, why did 
Willy Sutton rob banks? He said: Because 
that is where the money is. Why try it now— 
for the first time in history—to eliminate ex-
tended debate? Well, because they control 
every lever of the Federal Government. That 
is the very reason why we have the filibuster 
rule. So when one party, when one interest 
controls all levers of Government, one man 
or one woman can stand on the floor of the 
Senate and resist, if need be, the passions of 
the moment. 
But there is a second reason why they are 
focusing on the courts. That is because they 
have been unable to get their agenda passed 
through the legislative bodies. Think about 
it. With all the talk about how they rep-
resent the majority of the American people, 
none of their agenda has passed as it relates 
to the fifth amendment, as it relates to zon-
ing laws, as it relates to the ability of Fed-
eral agencies, such as the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, the Environmental Protection 
Agency, to do their jobs. 
Read what they write when they write 
about the nondelegation doctrine. That sim-
ply means, we in the Congress, as they read 
the Constitution, cannot delegate to the En-
vironmental Protection Agency the author-
ity to set limits on how much of a percent-
age of carcinogens can be admitted into the 
air or admitted into the water. They insist 
that we, the Senate, have to vote on every 
one of those rules, that we, the Senate and 
the House, with the ability of the President 
to veto, would have to vote on any and all 
drugs that are approved or not approved. 
If you think I am exaggerating, look at 
these Web sites. These are not a bunch of 
wackos. These are a bunch of very bright, 
very smart, very well-educated intellectuals 
who see these Federal restraints as a re-
straint upon competition, a restraint upon 
growth, a restraint upon the powerful. 
The American people see what is going on. 
They are too smart, and they are too prac-
tical. They might not know the meaning of 
the nondelegation doctrine, they might not 
know the clause of the fifth amendment re-
lating to property, they may not know the 
meaning of the tenth and eleventh amend-
ments as interpreted by Judge Ginsburg and 
others, but they know that the strength of 
our country lies in common sense and our 
common pragmatism, which is antithetical 
to the poisons of the extremes on either side. 
The American people will soon learn that 
Justice Janice Rogers Brown—one of the 
nominees who we are not allowing to be con-
firmed, one of the ostensible reasons for this 
nuclear option being employed—has decried 
the Supreme Court’s ‘‘socialist revolution of 
1937.’’ Read Social Security. Read what they 
write and listen to what they say. The very 
year that a 5-to-4 Court upheld the constitu-
tionality of Social Security against a strong 
challenge—1937—Social 
Security 
almost 
failed by one vote. 
It was challenged in the Supreme Court as 
being confiscatory. People argued then that 
a Government has no right to demand that 
everyone pay into the system, no right to de-
mand that every employer pay into the sys-
tem. Some of you may agree with that. It is 
a legitimate argument, but one rejected by 
the Supreme Court in 1937, that Justice 
Brown refers to as the ‘‘socialist revolution 
of 1937.’’ 
If it had not been for some of the things 
they had already done, nobody would believe 
what I am saying here. These guys mean 
what they say. The American people are 
going to soon learn that one of the leaders of 
the constitutional exile school, the group 
that wants to reinstate the Constitution as 
it existed in 1920, said of another filibustered 
judge, William Pryor that ‘‘Pryor is the key 
to this puzzle. There’s nobody like him. I 
think he’s sensational. He gets almost all of 
it.’’ 
That is the reason why I oppose him. He 
gets all of it. And you are about to get all of 
it if they prevail. We will not have to debate 
about Social Security on this floor. 
So the radical right makes its power play 
now when they control all political centers 
of power, however temporary. The radical 
push through the nuclear option and then 
pack the courts with unimpeded judges who, 
by current estimations, will serve an average 
of 25 years. The right is focused on packing 
the courts because their agenda is so radical 
that they are unwilling to come directly to 
you, the American people, and tell you what 
they intend. 
Without the filibuster, President Bush will 
send over more and more judges of this na-
ture, with perhaps three or four Supreme 
Court nominations. And there will be noth-
ing—nothing—that any moderate Republican 
friends and I will be able to do about it. 
Judges who will influence the rights of av-
erage Americans: The ability to sue your 
HMO that denies you your rights; the ability 
to keep strip clubs out of your neighbor-
hood—because they make zoning laws uncon-
stitutional—without you paying to keep the

person from building; the ability to protect 
the land your kids play on, the water they 
drink, the air they breathe, and the privacy 
of your family in your own home. 
Remember, many of my colleagues say 
there is no such thing as a right to privacy 
in any iteration under the Constitution of 
the United States of America. Fortunately, 
we have had a majority of judges who dis-
agreed with that over the past 70 years. But 
hang on, folks. The fight over judges, at bot-
tom, is not about abortion and not about 
God, it is about giving greater power to the 
already powerful. The fight is about main-
taining our civil rights protections, about 
workplace safety and worker protections, 
about effective oversight of financial mar-
kets, and protecting against insider trading. 
It is about Social Security. What is really at 
stake in this debate is, point blank, the 
shape of our constitutional system for the 
next generation. 
The nuclear option is a twofer. It excises, 
friends, our courts and, at the same time, 
emasculates the Senate. Put simply, the nu-
clear option would transform the Senate 
from the so-called cooling saucer our Found-
ing Fathers talked about to cool the passions 
of the day to a pure majoritarian body like 
a Parliament. We have heard a lot in recent 
weeks about the rights of the majority and 
obstructionism. But the Senate is not meant 
to be a place of pure majoritarianism. 
Is majority rule what you really want? Do 
my Republican colleagues really want ma-
jority rule in this Senate? Let me remind 
you, 44 of us Democrats represent 161 million 
people. One hundred sixty-one million Amer-
icans voted for these 44 Democrats. Do you 
know how many Americans voted for the 55 
of you? One hundred thirty-one million. If 
this were about pure majorities, my party 
represents more people in America than the 
Republican Party does. But that is not what 
it is about. Wyoming, the home State of the 
Vice President, the President of this body, 
gets one Senator for every 246,000 citizens; 
California, gets one Senator for 17 million 
Americans. More Americans voted for Vice 
President Gore than they did Governor Bush. 
By majoritarian logic, Vice President Gore 
won the election. 
Republicans control the Senate, and they 
have decided they are going to change the 
rule. At its core, the filibuster is not about 
stopping a nominee or a bill, it is about com-
promise and moderation. That is why the 
Founders put unlimited debate in. When you 
have to—and I have never conducted a fili-
buster—but if I did, the purpose would be 
that you have to deal with me as one Sen-
ator. It does not mean I get my way. It 
means you may have to compromise. You 
may have to see my side of the argument. 
That is what it is about, engendering com-
promise and moderation. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the nuclear option 
extinguishes the power of Independents and 
moderates in this Senate. That is it. They 
are done. Moderates are important only if 
you need to get 60 votes to satisfy cloture. 
They are much less important if you need 
only 50 votes. I understand the frustration of 
our Republican colleagues. I have been here 
32 years, most of the time in the majority. 
Whenever you are in the majority, it is frus-
trating to see the other side block a bill or 
a nominee you support. I have walked in 
your shoes, and I get it. 
I get it so much that what brought me to 
the Senate was the fight for civil rights. My 
State, to its great shame, was segregated by 
law, was a slave State. I came here to fight 
it. But even I understood, with all the pas-
sion I felt as a 29-year-old kid running for 
the Senate, the purpose—the purpose—of ex-
tended debate. Getting rid of the filibuster 
has long-term consequences. If there is one 
thing I have learned in my years here, once 
you change the rules and surrender the Sen-
ate’s institutional power, you never get it 
back. And we are about to break the rules to 
change the rules. 
I do not want to hear about ‘‘fair play’’ 
from my friends. Under our rules, you are re-
quired to get 2⁄3 of the votes to change the 
rules. Watch what happens when the major-
ity leader stands up and says to the Vice 
President—if we go forward with this—he 
calls the question. One of us, I expect our 
leader, on the Democratic side will stand up 
and say: Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Presi-
dent. Is this parliamentarily appropriate? In 
every other case since I have been here, for 
32 years, the Presiding Officer leans down to 
the Parliamentarian and says: What is the 
rule, Mr. Parliamentarian? The Parliamen-
tarian turns and tells them. 
Hold your breath, Parliamentarian. He is 
not going to look to you because he knows 
what you would say. He would say: This is 
not parliamentarily appropriate. You cannot 
change the Senate rules by a pure majority 
vote. 
So if any of you think I am exaggerating, 
watch on television, watch when this hap-
pens, and watch the Vice President ignore— 
he is not required to look to an unelected of-
ficer, but that has been the practice for 218 
years. He will not look down and say: What 
is the ruling? He will make the ruling, which 
is a lie, a lie about the rule. 
Isn’t what is really going on here that the 
majority does not want to hear what others 
have to say, even if it is the truth? Senator 
Moynihan, my good friend who I served with 
for years, said: You are entitled to your own 
opinion but not your own facts. 
The nuclear option abandons America’s 
sense of fair play. It is the one thing this 
country stands for: Not tilting the playing 
field on the side of those who control and 
own the field. 
I say to my friends on the Republican side: 
You may own the field right now, but you 
won’t own it forever. I pray God when the 
Democrats take back control, we don’t make 
the kind of naked power grab you are doing. 
But I am afraid you will teach my new col-
leagues the wrong lessons. 
We are the only Senate in the Senate as 
temporary custodians of the Senate. The 
Senate will go on. Mark my words, history 
will judge this Republican majority harshly, 
if it makes this catastrophic move. 
Ms. ERNST. I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that I be recognized for up to 15 
minutes and Senators PADILLA
and 
CANTWELL for up to 5 minutes each 
prior to the scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTING RIGHTS ACT 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
there are several issues swirling around 
the Senate at this moment. They re-
late to the voting rights of Americans. 
They relate to the voting rights of Sen-
ators—interesting 
that 
they 
would 
both be on parallel tracks as we debate 
them on the floor. It appears that the 
voting rights of Americans is wit-
nessing a historic shift. You see, my 
Democratic Party, and yours, in his-
tory has a spotty record when it comes 
to voting rights. In fact, Southern 
States—then in the thrall of the Demo-
cratic Party—wrote a terrible record 
after the Civil War. 
We released African Americans from 
slavery, guaranteed them the right to 
vote, and then watched what happened. 
There was jubilation all over the coun-
try, I believe, for the most part, and 
there was jubilation in the southern 
States by African Americans who had 
newfound freedoms they never dreamed 
of with the end of slavery. And they 
took them to heart. They did register 
to vote. 
And there were dramatic differences 
in many States because in many States 
the slave population, the African- 
American population, was much larger 
than any voting had ever reflected, and 
now they had the chance. And as they 
were elected to local offices and even 
congressional seats and even a senato-
rial seat, there was a backlash from 
the White population. 
This period of Reconstruction after 
the Civil War lapsed into a period of 
denial of the right to vote and elabo-
rate plans by Whites—White Demo-
crats, I might add—in southern States 
to manufacture obstacles to the voting 
of African Americans—poll taxes, for 
example, literacy tests, things that had 
little or nothing to do with citizenship 
but were designed expressly to jeop-
ardize the voting opportunities for 
those without advanced educations or 
the kind of clout necessary to over-
come. 
And so the net result was the South 
went White again in terms of its polit-
ical leadership. It was known as Jim 
Crow. And the Democratic Party of 
that day was behind it. The opposition 
came from Abraham Lincoln’s party, 
the Republican Party. They were the 
ones for abolition of slavery. They were 
the ones who supported Reconstruc-
tion. They were the ones, by and large, 
who sent the Federal troops in to en-
force equality in the South. But, ulti-
mately, sadly, as a result of a brokered 
Presidential election, there was a con-
cession made that gave to the Demo-
crat Party-controlled South States’ 
rights to determine voting standards. 
And that was the situation that ap-
plied in the United States from that 
period of time in the mid-19th century, 
until the 1960s, when this issue was de-
bated anew, right here in Washington, 
right here in this Chamber. 
And those who opposed striking down 
the Jim Crow laws, those who opposed 
efforts to deny to African Americans 
the right to vote, asserted one abiding 
principle: States rights. The States 
should be allowed to make this deci-
sion. It didn’t go very far. It took a lot 
of years of debate, I might add, I don’t 
want to oversimplify it. 
But anyone who took the time to 
read this book, the Constitution of the 
United States, understands it is ex-
plicit. It doesn’t take long to read the 
sections that are applying. 
Listen to this and think in your mind 
whether there is any question who has 
the authority to determine the rules of 
Federal elections. And I read: ‘‘Article 
I, section 4—The Times, Places, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S180 
January 12, 2022 
Manner of holding elections for Sen-
ators and Representatives, shall be pre-
scribed in each State by the Legisla-
ture thereof; but the Congress may at 
any time by Law make or alter such 
Regulations, except as to the Places of 
chusing Senators.’’ 
The 15th Amendment went further on 
the issue of race, and the net result of 
it was the passage of some laws in the 
1960s, the Voting Rights Act, and the 
establishment of standards to open up 
opportunities to vote in the South for 
people of color. 
It took that long from the late 19th 
century to the 1960s before that issue 
was addressed effectively. But for the 
longest time, it became a consensus 
issue. Republicans were as supportive 
of this as Democrats. In fact, propor-
tionally, they were more supportive. 
The Republican Party—the party of 
Abraham Lincoln—rejected the theory 
of States rights and said there will be 
Federal standards that are created and 
will be enforced on a bipartisan basis 
by Presidents of both parties. 
It was an amazing evolution in Amer-
ica, considering what we had been 
through, a civil war and all that fol-
lowed, to have reached the point where 
we said that the Federal Government 
could review decisions made by States 
if they, in any way, discriminate on a 
racial basis or any other basis in terms 
of ethnic identity. 
That was so popular and so bipar-
tisan that for years the renewal of that 
law was automatic. There was hardly a 
dissenting 
vote. 
Boy, 
have 
times 
changed. They have changed to the 
point where the Democratic Party is 
now supportive of the Voting Rights 
Act and what it sought to achieve. And 
the party of Abraham Lincoln, the Re-
publican Party, comes to the floor 
every day and argues States rights. 
Yes, we are back into that mode 
again, but the argument is coming 
from the Republican side of the aisle. 
The tables have turned. The Demo-
cratic Party of the South is a different 
party today, thank goodness, and a 
party that stands for the principle that 
people are entitled to the right to vote. 
So we staged a national election in 
2020. In light of the pandemic that was 
looming over this Nation, we opened up 
opportunities to vote, and two things 
happened. We had the most dramatic 
turnout of voters in the United States 
of America for the office of President. 
We had never seen that kind of turnout 
of voters. 
And No. 2, when the Agencies of gov-
ernment took a close look at the votes 
that were cast, they found no evi-
dence—virtually none—of voter fraud 
or manipulation of the outcome of the 
election. 
It was obvious to all who were honest 
about it, including some Republicans 
who have said as much in the last few 
days. But one man dissented. That 
man, of course, was the former Presi-
dent of the United States, Donald 
Trump, the loser—the official loser—in 
the 2020 election. 
He is still in total denial. His mo-
mentous ego cannot countenance the 
possibility of rejection by the Amer-
ican voters, and so he claims the Big 
Lie that somehow or another this vote 
was stolen from the poor little former 
President. Though he can’t come up 
with any evidence to prove any aspect 
of that and has failed miserably vir-
tually every time he has gone to Fed-
eral court to argue it, he still con-
tinues to make that argument. 
It was that argument that was the 
inspiration behind the insurrectionist 
mob that was here in the Capitol Build-
ing a little over a year ago trying to 
stop the electoral college vote count. 
They failed, as they should have. The 
Constitution prevailed. The will of the 
American people prevailed. And so in 
legislatures across the country, includ-
ing the State of Wisconsin, we see Re-
publican legislatures saying that we 
are unhappy with the results in the 
2020 election; we want to change the 
rules when it comes to voting in our 
State. 
And almost without exception, every 
change in these Republican legisla-
tures results in a limited time to vote, 
a limited ability to vote, new obstacles 
to vote, and on and on and on. 
I have yet to see any of these Repub-
lican-led leislatures demonstrate an ef-
fort to the contrary, to expand the 
right to vote. 
And so based on article I, section 4 of 
the U.S. Constitution, we have written 
a bill, a bill that establishes basic 
standards of voting across America as 
this document envisioned: standards 
for voter registration, standards for ab-
sentee ballots, standards for same-day 
registration, 
standards 
for 
making 
election day a national holiday. Every 
one of these things that we have pro-
posed in our pending legislation is an 
expansion of opportunities to vote for 
eligible voters. 
It gets down to the bottom line: 
When it comes to eligible voters, 
should we create obstacles of hardship 
or should we make it easy for them to 
vote without endangering their fami-
lies, without losing their jobs, without 
hardship? 
I think that is the basic mission of a 
democratic legislature, is it not: the 
greatest possible participation of the 
greatest number of voters? Then let 
them decide on issue after issue. 
So that is the issue of voting rights 
in America that now comes to the floor 
of the U.S. Senate. 
On the question of the voting rights 
of Senators, it is interesting to me, 
every morning, that those in the 
Chamber start the session by pledging 
allegiance to the flag. It is apparent, 
from some of the arguments on the Re-
publican side, that they want to start 
this meeting of the Senate each day ad-
ditionally with a pledge of allegiance 
to the filibuster. 
Now, that is strange, because if you 
have any history in the U.S. Senate, 
you know what the filibuster has be-
come. It is not an occasional problem 
and challenge. It is now the standard. 
The filibuster, you see, requires 60 
votes for passage of a measure in a 
body of 100 people. It is an extraor-
dinary majority. It gives power to the 
minority, which the Senate, of course, 
was designed to do by giving two 
seats—two 
Senate 
seats—to 
every 
State, large and small, but it goes a 
step further. 
Despite what you may have heard on 
the floor earlier, the use of the fili-
buster—I should say the abuse of the 
filibuster—has led to the elimination, 
virtually, of debate and amendments 
on the floor. 
I have often said that if you are suf-
fering from insomnia and watch C– 
SPAN and turn on the U.S. Senate, you 
will see a perfect room and structure 
for a wedding reception because there 
is always plenty of room on the floor of 
the Senate. We should be leasing this 
out and using the money to reduce the 
national debt, the Senators use it so 
infrequently. 
There was a time—can you believe 
this now?—10 years ago, there was a 
time when 12 appropriation bills would 
come out of the committees and come 
to the floor and be subject to amend-
ments, and we would take turns offer-
ing amendments to all 12 appropria-
tions bills. That was the ordinary 
course of business. It is no longer the 
case. It hasn’t been that way for 10 
years. 
And when it comes to the debate and 
amendments on all the other items, the 
numbers tell the story. 
I want to thank my friend JEFF 
MERKLEY, who has done amazing re-
search on the Senate and its proce-
dures. 
In the 109th Congress, we considered 
314 amendments. That declined to just 
26 amendments under Republican lead-
ership in the last Congress. Twenty-six 
amendments in a year? Compared to 
314? Thank you, to the filibuster. That 
is where we are today. Thank you, to 
the 60-vote requirement. That is where 
we are today. And thanks to my col-
leagues on the Republican side who are 
trying to ignore those numbers. They 
are so graphic. 
On nominations, there were only 
three cloture motions in the history of 
the United States before 1975—three. 
After 1975 to now, 852 times cloture has 
been filed on nominations—852 weeks 
of Senate time potentially obstructed. 
That is the Senate today. That is the 
Senate under a filibuster. And if this 
Senate is going to join the House in es-
tablishing standards for equal voting 
rights across America, the filibuster is 
the obstacle. 
I know this story personally. I intro-
duced the DREAM Act 20 years ago—20 
years ago. And you say: Senator, I 
thought you were a hotshot legislator. 
What are you waiting for? Pass it. I 
sure wish I could. 
I brought it to the Senate floor five 
times in that 20-year period, the 
DREAM Act to help young people liv-
ing in this country to have a chance, a 
pathway to citizenship. On five dif-
ferent occasions it has been stopped by

filibuster. Don’t tell me the filibuster 
opens debate and opportunity. The fili-
buster has shut down debate on the 
DREAM Act five times in the last 20 
years, and that is just one isolated ex-
ample that is personal to me. That is 
what the filibuster is all about. It is 
stopping us from doing anything sub-
stantial on voting rights. It is stopping 
us from passing the DREAM Act. It is 
stopping us from passing meaningful 
immigration reform. 
The filibuster is designed for people 
who want to say no—no to progress, no 
to government, no to the Senate being 
engaged in the issues that affect the 
American people and families. 
I have seen colleagues come to the 
floor on the Republican side with 
quotes from me defending the fili-
buster. That was when I was a hopeful 
person in the Senate. 
My hope has been dashed by reality— 
by the reality of a Senate that has 
been shut down when it comes to na-
tional debate and shut down when it 
comes to national achievement. 
That, to me, has got to come to an 
end. I am prepared to sit down with 
any Republicans of good will—and 
Democrats included—and come up with 
some meaningful rules. 
You know, incidentally, that we are 
sitting here with a calendar that is 
loaded with nominations? It is not the 
filibuster, but it is something quite 
near to it, where one or two Republican 
Senators have decided that they don’t 
want to take the ordinary course for 
nominations. They want to drag them 
out interminably. 
That is unfair to President Biden. It 
is unfair to the American people. If you 
want to defeat a nomination, do your 
best. But to stop the debate of the Sen-
ate on these nominations to impose 
your will and to slow down the business 
of the Senate, I think is an unaccept-
able standard. 
And so for the voting rights of Amer-
ican to have a chance to be protected 
and for the voting rights of Senators to 
finally be engaged on the floor in that 
process, we have to be ready to make a 
change. I am ready. And as I said, I am 
ready to do it on a bipartisan basis. 
But for goodness’ sake, this empty, si-
lent Chamber is no indication of what 
the Founding Fathers had in mind 
when they created this legislature. 
We are supposed to be engaged in de-
bate, not afraid of debate. We shouldn’t 
be running off and hiding behind 60 
votes. I am open for change. I wish 
some Republicans would join us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from California. 
NOMINATION OF GABRIEL P. SANCHEZ 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
rise today to urge my colleagues to 
join me in confirming Justice Gabriel 
Sanchez to the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit. 
Justice Sanchez has long be held in 
high esteem in California’s legal cir-
cles. He brings thoughtfulness and em-
pathy to every decision that he makes. 
He was born and raised in Los Ange-
les and was the proud son of a single 
mother from Mexico. She raised him 
while working tirelessly to make ends 
meet. With her unwavering support, 
Justice Sanchez went on to earn de-
grees from Yale College, from Cam-
bridge University, and graduated from 
Yale Law School. 
He began his legal career as a law 
clerk to Judge Richard Paez on the 
Ninth Circuit, the same court where he 
is now nominated to serve. Justice 
Sanchez then went into private prac-
tice, as many young lawyers do, but he 
committed himself to engaging in the 
community deeply by providing pro 
bono legal services, so much so that in 
the year 2010, he earned a social justice 
award from the ACLU of Southern 
California for his work representing 
farm workers in a lawsuit to enforce 
workplace safety protections to help 
prevent deadly heat illnesses. 
Justice Sanchez went on to serve 
with distinction in California State 
government; first, as a deputy attorney 
general, and then as a deputy legal af-
fairs 
secretary 
to 
then-Governor 
Brown. There, he proved himself to be 
a critical thinker, a creative problem- 
solver, and a dedicated public servant. 
In recognition of his work and his 
service, his even-handed judgments, 
and his great legal talent, Governor 
Brown appointed Justice Sanchez to 
the California Court of Appeals in 2018. 
Justice Sanchez has earned a reputa-
tion as an outstanding jurist com-
mitted to justice for all. 
I am confident that he will bring the 
same dedication to the bench of the 
Ninth Circuit, and I am proud to sup-
port his confirmation today. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). Under the previous order, the 
motion to reconsider is considered 
made and laid upon the table, and the 
President will be immediately notified 
of the Senate’s action. 
The Senator from South Dakota. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
Democrats’ campaign to break the Sen-
ate continues. 
I want to read a quote: 
The ideologues in the Senate want to turn 
what the Founding Fathers called the cool-
ing saucer of democracy into the rubber 
stamp of dictatorship. 
Not my words—those are the words of 
the current Senate Democrat leader 
back in 2005 when filibuster changes 
were under discussion. The current 
Democrat leader was once, in fact, a 
defender of the filibuster and the role 
it plays in ensuring that the minority 
party in the Senate and the Americans 
it represents have a voice. In fact, the 
minority leader at various times has 
described trying to get rid of the fili-
buster as ‘‘doomsday for democracy.’’ 
He described those who were behind the 
effort to try to get rid of the filibuster 
as being in support of turning America 
into ‘‘a banana republic.’’ Those were 
statements made by the current Demo-
crat leader when he was defending the 
filibuster in years past. 
In fact, a lot of my colleagues across 
the aisle have defended the filibuster 
and used the filibuster repeatedly when 
they were in the minority. In the last 
Congress alone, Democrats filibustered 
COVID relief legislation until they got 
a bill that they could support. They 
filibustered police reform legislation. 
They filibustered Israel legislation. 
They filibustered pro-life legislation— 
and on and on. 
While Republicans certainly didn’t 
enjoy it when Democrats used the fili-
buster when we were in the majority, 
we recognized that it meant that our 
Senate was working the way that the 
Founders intended—as a place of com-
promise and deliberation, where the 
minority, as well as the majority, was 
represented. That is why we resisted 
repeated calls from the former Presi-
dent, our party’s President, when we 
had the majority to abolish the fili-
buster. 
Abolishing the filibuster certainly 
would have made it easier for us to ad-
vance important legislation—legisla-
tion that was of value to Members on 
our side, things that we wanted to see 
get done—but we knew that sacrificing 
the long-term good of the Senate and 
the country for short-term gain was 
not an acceptable course of action. 
Let’s be very clear that the gain 
would have been short term. If we had 
abolished the legislative filibuster, we 
could have passed a lot of important 
legislation, only to see it overturned as 
soon as Democrats took control of the 
legislative 
and 
executive 
branches. 
Once we returned to unified Republican 
government, we could, of course, have 
put our original legislation back in 
place. That is the kind ping-ponging 
that would be terrible for our country. 
Sharp changes in Federal policy 
every few years would mean endless 
confusion for Americans. Plus, free of 
the moderating influence of the fili-
buster, legislation would almost un-
questionably become more extreme, 
which would harden and intensify par-
tisan division not just here in Congress 
but in the country as a whole. Ordinary 
citizens would look ever more distrust-
ful at government, which would quick-
ly come to be seen as government for 
Americans of one party only—the 
party of power. 
Democrats should know all of the 
things that I am saying. After all, they 
were in the minority just 1 year ago. It 
is hard for me to understand how they 
could forget that. Do they think that 
because they have the majority now, 
that they will always have it? History 
would beg to differ. 
I realize the Democrats have hopes 
that if they pass their election legisla-
tion, it will help them stay in power, 
but surely—surely—Democrats don’t 
believe that they can maintain a per-
manent hold on government. There 
have been some pretty robust Senate 
majorities in American history, but 
sooner or later, power has always shift-
ed, and the Presidency has shifted too. 
Even if Democrats succeed in all of 
their election machinations, the day 
will come—and probably sooner rather 
than later—when their party will re-
turn to the minority, and I suspect 
that at that point, they would bitterly 
regret the loss of the legislative fili-
buster. 
Democrats have already had cause to 
regret the loss of the filibuster for judi-
cial nominations. More than one Demo-
crat Senator has openly admitted re-
gretting Democrats’ move to abolish 
the filibuster for judges and other 
nominees. 
The unravelling of the filibuster for 
judicial nominations should be a lesson 
to both parties on how well weakening 
the filibuster or creating a filibuster 
carve-out 
would 
work. 
Democrats 
carved out a filibuster exception for ex-
ecutive and judicial nominees, and Re-
publicans took it to its logical conclu-
sion. 
A 
legislative 
filibuster 
carve-out 
would be the end of the legislative fili-
buster, period. 
If Democrats’ carve out an exception 
for election legislation, a future Senate 
would be likely to carve out an excep-
tion for something else and so on and 
so forth, until the filibuster was carved 
out of existence completely. 
In fact, I strongly suspect that a fili-
buster carve-out solely for election leg-
islation wouldn’t even survive the com-
ing year. I can imagine my Democrat 
colleagues quickly deciding that some 
other priority of theirs was also worthy 
of a special exemption. It is possible 
that the legislative filibuster would be 
gone before the end of this Congress. 
Again, I urge my Democrat col-
leagues to remember their decision to 
remove the filibuster for judicial nomi-
nations and how quickly that came 
back to haunt them. They may like the 
idea of forcing through their legisla-
tion now, but sooner or later—and 
probably sooner—I can guarantee that 
they will regret it. 
The filibuster and its protection for 
the rights of the minority are safe so 
long as neither party starts to chip 
away at it. Once one party starts weak-
ening the filibuster, especially on a to-
tally partisan basis, that will be the 
end of the filibuster and the end of real 
representation for the minority in Con-
gress. 
It is deeply disappointing that the 
Democrat leader and the President 
have abandoned their previous support 
for protecting representation for the 
minority. It is even more astonishing, 
really, that they have done so when 
they enjoy the narrowest majorities in 
Congress. It should be a reminder of 
how quickly Democrats could once 
again return to the minority and be in 
need of the legislative filibuster. 
But I know that there are Democrats 
out there with serious doubts about 
their leadership’s course of action. 
Some would express this doubt openly, 
but I suspect there are others who 
haven’t spoken up who also have seri-
ous reservations. After all, a majority 
of the current Senate Democrat caucus 
signed a letter just 4 short years ago 
expressing their belief in the impor-
tance of the filibuster. I cannot believe 
that all of them would change their po-
sition merely because the political 
winds have shifted. 
So I urge all of my Democrat col-
leagues to resist this blatant power 
grab by the Democrat leadership and 
preserve our longstanding commitment 
to representation for the minority in 
the U.S. Senate, the purpose for which 
this institution was created, and the 
Americans it represents. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

ator from Florida.

January 12, 2022 
COMMENDING 
THE 
ACTIONS 
OF 
CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS AND DE-
MOCRACY ACTIVIST JOSE DAN-
IEL FERRER GARCIA, AND ALL 
PRO-DEMOCRACY 
AND 
HUMAN 
RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, IN DEMAND-
ING FUNDAMENTAL CIVIL LIB-
ERTIES IN CUBA AND SPEAKING 
OUT AGAINST CUBA’S BRUTAL, 
TOTALITARIAN COMMUNIST RE-
GIME 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, yesterday marked 6 months since 
July 11—a day when brave Cubans all 
across that island marched for democ-
racy, cried out for freedom, and sent a 
clear message that the time was up for 
the illegitimate communist regime. 
From Havana to Santa Clara to 
Santiago de Cuba, the message of 
‘‘Patria y Vida!’’ could be heard from 
the people. Cuban families and dem-
onstrators stood against the revolu-
tion’s motto of ‘‘Patria o Muerte’’ to 
once again declare that the revolution 
had failed. 
That failed revolution promised pros-
perity and equality for all, but the only 
equal thing about it was poverty, suf-
fering, and oppression for all. We 
watched as families gathered outside 
the headquarters of the Cuban Com-
munist Party to chant ‘‘Cuba isn’t 
yours!’’ Their message was clear: It is 
time for a new day of freedom and de-
mocracy in Cuba. 
Instead of listening to the cries of 
their people, the communist Cuban re-
gime lashed out with violence and the 
oppression it has used for more than 60 
years to silence opposition to its reign. 
The regime and its thugs kidnapped in-
nocent democracy activists and kept 
others trapped in their homes. Right 
now, hundreds of Cubans have been in-
definitely detained or unjustly sen-
tenced to prison simply for demanding 
basic human rights. 
Some of these protesters are facing 
prison sentences as long as 30 years. 
One of them is Jose Daniel Ferrer, the 
leader of the pro-democracy UNPACU 
group and a dedicated freedom and 
human rights activist. Since his de-
tainment, I have had the chance to 
talk to his family several times. Each 
time we speak, the stories they tell me 
are more heartbreaking. 
Jose Daniel is being tortured by the 
communist regime in an attempt to 
end his life. He is suffering from severe 
headaches, mouth bleeding, malnutri-
tion, cough, and insomnia—all prod-
ucts of the cruel torture and inhumane 
treatment from the regime. 
We 
can 
also 
think 
about 
Felix 
Navarro, another longtime freedom ac-
tivist who helps lead a pro-democracy 
group on the island. He was arrested, 
not for demonstrating but for asking 
police about the status of some of the 
members of his group who had been de-
tained. 
Reports indicate even young teen-
agers are being detained indefinitely. 
The unjust imprisonment, beatings, 
and torture of the Cuban people is ab-
horrent. It is inhumane, and it cannot 
be tolerated. It is clear that these ac-
tions stem from the regime’s para-
lyzing fear over the freedom movement 
spreading across Cuba. They are terri-
fied that there is a new day of freedom 
on the rise for the Cuban people, so 
they resort to total oppression and to 
the silencing of any mention of inde-
pendence or freedom. 
As the greatest beacon of freedom 
and democracy in the world, the United 
States must stand against the com-
munist regime and with the Cuban peo-
ple. I am thankful that U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Brian Nichols re-
cently called for the immediate release 
of the July 11 demonstrators. Along 
with his calls, we need the voices of 
President 
Biden 
and 
Secretary 
Blinken, and their calls need to be cou-
pled with action that actually pres-
sures 
the 
illegitimate 
communist 
Cuban regime now. 
It was only a couple of weeks ago 
when I called the White House to talk 
about the case of Jose Daniel Ferrer. 
The first time I called, they asked me 
to leave a message, so I did. When I 
called the next day, the White House 
hung up on me. 
Throughout his entire first year in 
office, Joe Biden has been shamefully 
silent about Cuba. Just like he does 
with communist China, Biden’s strat-
egy on Cuba is to do the bare min-
imum. Even while the protests were 
ongoing, he did nothing to alleviate the 
suffering of the Cuban people. 
Compare that to the Organization of 
American States. After I spoke with 
them a few weeks ago, Secretary Gen-
eral Luis Almagro issued a statement 
demanding the immediate release of all 
arbitrarily imprisoned political pris-
oners. He expressed special concern for 
the well-being of Jose Daniel Ferrer 
and urged the Cuban regime to allow a 
humanitarian mission that can imme-
diately verify the state and situation 
of political prisoners in the country. 
Why can’t Joe Biden make that same 
request? Where is the President? He 
has had 6 months to help provide inter-
net to the Cuban people to help dis-
seminate information and help the 
freedom movement, but he has done 
nothing. His silence is appeasement, 
and those of us who love freedom will 
not simply sit by idly while he refuses 
to act. 
As long as the illegitimate com-
munist Cuban regime continues to 
deny the people their freedom, democ-
racy, and basic human rights, I am 
going to fight alongside them and de-
mand action. 
Today, the Senate can do something. 
Today, the U.S. Senate can pass a reso-
lution honoring Cuban activists like 
Jose Daniel Ferrer, condemning the 
Cuban dictatorship’s repression, and 
calling for the international commu-
nity to stand with the Cuban people. I 
have introduced a resolution that does 
exactly that, and it is something that 
everyone in the Chamber should agree 
with. 
I am thankful for Senators MARCO 
RUBIO
and MIKE
BRAUN
for cospon-
soring this resolution. I am also thank-
ful for MARIO DIAZ-BALART, Congress-
woman 
SALAZAR, 
and 
Congressman 
GIMENEZ
for introducing the com-
panion resolution in the House. 
We must make sure our message to 
the Cuban people is clear: America has 
not and will not forget you. We have 
seen your bravery and courage. We 
have heard your calls for freedom. You 
have risked everything for the freedom 
of Cubans across the island. You are an 
inspiration to us all. 
I ask unanimous consent to address 
the Senate in Spanish. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
(English translation of the state-
ments made in Spanish are as follows:) 
We must make sure our message to the 
Cuban people is clear: America has not and 
will not forget you. 
We have seen your bravery and courage. 
We have heard your calls for freedom. 
You have risked everything for the free-
dom of Cubans across the island. You are an 
inspiration to us all. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 489, which is at the desk. I fur-
ther ask that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, and that 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, let me first 
say that I rise, in the first instance, be-
fore having heard the Senator’s re-
marks, to say that I have serious con-
cerns about the junior Senator from 
Florida’s lack of respect for the regular 
order of the Senate. 
On July 11, 2021, the Cuban people 
took to the streets in unprecedented 
protests, demanding democracy and 
the end of decades of dictatorship. Sub-
sequently, the Senate came together in 
unanimous consent to pass my S. Res. 
310. My bipartisan legislation expressed 
our unwavering solidarity with the 
Cuban people and called for the release 
of all political prisoners detained un-
justly by the Diaz-Canel regime. 
My legislation was the result of bi-
partisan negotiations, and it was ap-
proved unanimously by the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee. That is 
what regular order looks like, and it is 
a process that strengthens the impact 
of our work on foreign policy when we 
can speak together in one voice to pro-
mote that foreign policy, whether it is 
to the Cuban regime or whether it is in 
any other place in the world. 
Now, I need to make the point that 
the junior Senator from Florida rou-
tinely disregards this process. In this 
particular case, not only has this reso-
lution not been marked up by the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee, not 
only is it not bipartisan—as far as I 
know, nobody has been offered even the

opportunity to join it—but it hasn’t 
even been introduced so that the Par-
liamentarian would decide where it 
would be sent to committee for referral 
for consideration. It hasn’t even been 
introduced. It has not received the re-
view it deserves. In fact, it has not re-
ceived any formal review. 
As I have repeatedly said as the 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, I stand ready to work 
with any Member—and have done so— 
on initiatives that advance the na-
tional security interests of the United 
States and the defense of democracy 
and human rights. While there may be 
some urgent moments that require us 
to move legislation directly to the 
floor, regular order exists for a rea-
son—to facilitate consensus and ensure 
that the legislation we consider on the 
floor reflects the input and expertise of 
Senators who sit on the relevant com-
mittees of jurisdiction. 
Now, I have spent the last several 
days listening to my Republican col-
leagues talk about the fullness of legis-
lative debate, of not preempting legis-
lative debate, of not preempting pro-
longed legislative debate in the context 
of the filibuster. Here is a piece of leg-
islation that hasn’t even been intro-
duced, but it is being brought directly 
to the floor. How does that promote 
legislative 
debate? 
It 
doesn’t. 
It 
doesn’t. 
I happen to agree with the Senator 
about his focus here as it relates to 
those who are struggling inside of Cuba 
to create freedom, but I want to send a 
clarion message that I will not simply 
allow legislation that is in the purview 
of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee to come directly to the floor 
without even an introduction, without 
review, without any debate, and then 
believe that one will just allow it to go 
through on unanimous consent. That is 
not how the Senate works. 
I would urge the junior Senator from 
Florida to consider this for future leg-
islative endeavors, especially as we are 
also concerned about the filibuster and 
extended debate. Well, this is the worst 
example of not having extended debate. 
Lastly, I deeply disagree with the 
Senator’s 
characterization—I 
wasn’t 
even going to reference it—in having 
listened to his remarks, about the 
Biden administration. The Biden ad-
ministration sanctioned individuals in 
Cuba, high-ranking individuals of the 
Cuban military, who have never been 
sanctioned before. The Biden adminis-
tration led a multilateral effort for the 
condemnation of what happened in 
Cuba as a result of the citizens of Cuba 
seeking to simply redress their griev-
ances against the dictatorship that ex-
ists there, and brought in countries 
that have never ever expressed them-
selves in such a way before. The Biden 
administration worked with the Sec-
retary General of the OAS to take the 
strong position that the Senator re-
ferred to. 
So I hate to say it, but this almost 
comes across as a naked, political, par-
tisan effort to try to promote some 
perspective when, in fact, we should be 
embracing this together through reg-
ular order, in a bipartisan process, 
which the Cuban people, particularly 
those suffering inside of Cuba, deserve. 
However, because of this particular 
moment and at this particular time 
and having given the Senator good no-
tice about other future endeavors—this 
is not the first time—I will not object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 489) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I am glad to see this resolution pass. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Sen-
ators MARCO RUBIO and MIKE BRAUN, 
for cosponsoring this resolution and 
Congressman DIAZ-BALART, Congress-
woman 
SALAZAR, 
and 
Congressman 
GIMENEZ for supporting this resolution 
in the House. 
In my roles as a U.S. Senator and the 
Governor of Florida, I have had the 
honor of meeting and speaking with 
countless Cubans who have risked their 
lives to flee Castro’s brutal regime. 
Many of them came here with nothing, 
scarred by the oppression of the regime 
but hopeful for a new life. With what 
little they had, they started businesses 
and families and built thriving commu-
nities and are a major part of the econ-
omy of Florida. 
We have all seen their resolve to 
fight for freedom, support their fami-
lies, and contribute to their commu-
nities. They are an example of the 
American dream and a testimony to 
the ills of communism and socialism. 
The Cuban people are a source of inspi-
ration for all of us. They show us what 
can be accomplished when you have 
freedom and opportunity. 
That is why we continue to fight for 
the end of communism in Cuba and for 
the freedom and liberties of every 
Cuban family. It is why we should all 
join 
them 
and 
say 
‘‘Abajo 
la 
Dictadura!’’ ‘‘Patria, vida y Libertad!’’

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
FILIBUSTER 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, our de-
mocracy is protected by its institu-
tional checks on unlimited power. The 
three branches of government are not 
the only manifestation of the careful 
balancing achieved by the Framers of 
the Constitution. Within the legisla-
tive branch, the Senate’s unique tradi-
tions protect the rights of the minority 
party by allowing extended debate and 
by requiring a supermajority vote to 
pass legislation, with few exceptions. 
These rules have helped to make the 
U.S. Senate the greatest deliberative 
body in the world. 
Before commenting further on the 
importance of the extended debate and 
the 60-vote requirement for passing leg-
islation, I want to point out a critical 
protection built into the Senate’s pro-
cedures. Changing the rules requires 67 
votes, not 60 votes, not 51 votes—67 
votes. 
But in a power grab that would be in-
credibly destructive to the functioning 
of the Senate, the Democratic leader is 
proposing to circumvent the rules in 
order to eviscerate the filibuster be-
cause he does not have anywhere near 
the 67 votes required to rewrite the 
Senate rules. Instead, he will propose 
to ‘‘change the rules by breaking the 
rules,’’ as former Democratic Senator 
Carl Levin, a true giant of the Senate, 
put it when arguing against a similar 
ploy in 2013. 
As one of Senator Levin’s prede-
cessors, Arthur Vandenberg, warned in 
1949, if the majority can change the 
rules of the Senate at will, ‘‘there are 
no rules except the transient, unregu-
lated wishes of a majority of whatever 
quorum is temporarily in control of the 
Senate.’’ 
Both Senators Levin and Vandenberg 
actually favored the rule change being 
considered at the time, but each recog-
nized that ‘‘breaking the rules to 
change the rules’’ would irreparably 
harm the Senate and, thus, our coun-
try. 
Democrats well understand the con-
sequences of what they are proposing. 
Just 5 short years ago, Senator Chris 
Coons and I wrote a letter urging Sen-
ate leaders to preserve the 60-vote 
threshold for legislation. That letter 
was signed by 61 Senators: 28 Repub-
licans, 32 Democrats, and 1 Inde-
pendent. This total not only rep-
resented a majority of Senators but 
also a majority of the Republican cau-
cus, a majority of the Democratic Cau-
cus, and the current Vice President. 
How well I remember seeking signa-
tures on the Senate floor for that let-
ter. Holding a green folder with the let-
ter inside, I approached Senators on 
both sides of the aisle to achieve my 
goal of a total of 60 Senators signing, 
representing a majority of each caucus. 
Not a single Senator whom I ap-
proached said no to signing the letter, 
not one. Quite the contrary, each was 
eager to sign the letter, and many 
thanked me for leading the effort to 
make clear that whatever our disagree-
ments on a supermajority vote for 
nominees, they were firmly committed 
to keeping the filibuster for legisla-
tion. They understood its vital impor-
tance to the Senate and to our country. 
This is what our letter stated, in 
part: 
[W]e are united in our determination to 
preserve the ability of Members to engage in 
extended debate when bills are on the Senate 
floor. 
We are mindful of the unique role the Sen-
ate plays in the legislative process, and we

in opposing any effort to curtail the existing 
rights and prerogatives of Senators to en-

we consider legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this bipartisan letter, dated 
April 7, 2017, be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL
AND 
DEMOCRATIC LEADER SCHUMER: We are writ-
ing to urge you to support our efforts to pre-
serve existing rules, practices, and traditions 
as they pertain to the right of Members to 
engage in extended debate on legislation be-
fore the United States Senate. Senators have 
expressed a variety of opinions about the ap-
propriateness of limiting debate when we are 
considering judicial and executive branch 
nominations. Regardless of our past dis-
agreements on that issue, we are united in 
our determination to preserve the ability of 
Members to engage in extended debate when 
bills are on the Senate floor. 
We are mindful of the unique role the Sen-
ate plays in the legislative process, and we 
are steadfastly committed to ensuring that 
this great American institution continues to 
serve as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Therefore, we are asking you to join us 
in opposing any effort to curtail the existing 
rights and prerogatives of Senators to en-

we consider legislation before this body in 
the future.

Ms. COLLINS. The culture of the 
Senate is built upon a foundation of re-
spect and cooperation that is meant to 
transcend partisanship. It is a culture 
in which legislative goals are reached 
with patience, persuasion, and perse-
verance, not raw power. 
I implore my colleagues to consider 
the ramifications for our country. Do 
we want laws enacted one year to be 
repealed 2 years later on a simple ma-
jority vote and then perhaps reenacted 
in another 2 years by just 51 votes? 
Do we want major laws, significant 
changes in policy, to be rammed 
through the Senate without thoughtful 
debate and bipartisan support? 
At a time when our country is deeply 
and closely divided, do we really want 
to worsen the polarization by improv-
ing significant changes in public policy 
by a narrow partisan vote? 
We are now on the brink of heading 
down that dangerous road, a slippery 
slope toward a tyranny of the major-
ity. Limiting the ability of Senators to 
engage in a debate on legislative mat-
ters would give the majority party un-
precedented power to push through 
major changes without careful delib-
eration or bipartisan cooperation. Such 
a move would have lasting implica-
tions, as future majorities—whether 
Republican or Democratic—would have 
little incentive to work with the other 
party. 
It is crucial that we work together 
and find common ground on the issues 
that matter most to the American peo-
ple. 
Changing 
longstanding 
Senate 
rules to benefit one political party 
would discourage efforts to forge con-
sensus and only serve to reinforce bit-
ter partisan divisions. 
I urge my colleagues to stand against 
this calamitous change and for the 
principles of compromise and coopera-
tion that have long defined and been 
the hallmarks of the U.S. Senate. 
Let us listen to the admonition of 
the Democratic leader when he spoke 
against changing the rules in 2017: ‘‘Let 
us go no further down this road.’’ 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT JOHN ‘‘BIG JOHN’’ 
QUINTRELL 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today, I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
John ‘‘Big John’’ Quintrell of Helena, 
MT, for bravely serving our Nation 
during the Vietnam war and for his 
dedication to supporting the heroes 
who fought alongside him. 
John served honorably in Vietnam 
from 1968 to 1969 with the Wolfhounds. 
I understand there are some Wolf-
hounds watching tonight. The Wolf-
hounds are the 2nd Battalion, 27th In-
fantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Divi-
sion. And he received honors, including 
the Bronze Star with Valor and the 
Purple Heart. 
Upon returning home, John was met 
with hostility and was shamed for his 
sacrifice in Vietnam by his fellow 
Americans. For the next 35 years, 
John, like so many of our veterans, 
kept that pain to himself. 
In 2004, John opened a box—a box 
filled with items that brought back 
memories of Vietnam—and he was in-
spired to host a reunion for his fellow 
Vietnam veterans. 
For the very first time in over 35 
years, these men were reunited. John’s 
reunion gave these often-forgotten he-
roes a sense of peace, a sense of accept-
ance, friendship, and healing. And fol-
lowing that successful reunion, John 
and the other Wolfhounds were on a 
mission to find others who served be-
side them. 
And since 2004, John has connected 
with over 125 Wolfhounds, and many 
have attended 1 of the 9 reunions John 
planned. After hearing John’s story, 
his children and grandchildren worked 
to keep these reunions going and the 
legacy alive. 
John’s support for his fellow Wolf-
hounds extends far beyond the reunions 
he planned. In 2018, John decided to 
document the stories of the Wolf-
hounds and their time in Vietnam. To 
date, John has conducted over 90—90— 
video interviews, and because of John’s 
work, future generations will have the 
opportunity to hear their relatives’ 
firsthand account of service in Viet-
nam. 
John decided to share his own story 
by publishing a book entitled ‘‘My 365 
Days With the Wolfhounds in Viet-
nam,’’ and he did that in 2021. 
John’s honest account of his experi-
ence in the Vietnam war has given 
countless veterans and their family 
members a sense of understanding, as 
well as healing. After years of sup-
pressing memories of his time in Viet-
nam, John now shares his story. He 
shares his story with others and en-
courages them to share their own expe-
rience and find their own path to heal-
ing. 
A big thanks to John’s passion, and 
because of his dedication in supporting 
his fellow veterans, many soldiers are 
once again proud of their sacrifice to 
our great Nation. You see, John epito-
mizes the heart of a Montana veteran, 
whose selfless service has reached far 
beyond the battlefield. So I want to 
thank John. I want to thank John for 
his service to our great country and for 
the kindness he has shown to the he-
roes who served alongside him. 
John, keep up the great work because 
you make Montana proud, and you 
make America proud.

VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this 
week, the Democrats are forcing yet 
another show vote on the so-called vot-
ing rights legislation. They claim the 
right to vote is under attack by the 
States, and there is nothing that could 
be further from the truth. 
Ahead of the 2020 elections, everyone 
from Vice President KAMALA HARRIS to 
Eric Holder to Stacey Abrams claimed 
that they were experiencing a wave of 
voter suppression. Now, that is very 
significant—a wave of voter suppres-
sion, as if they have to do something to 
change our system.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S186 
January 12, 2022 
And the facts are so clear on that. 
You know, people lie around here, but 
the facts don’t lie. The Census Bureau 
reported that the turnout in last year’s 
election was 66.8 percent. Now, that 
was the highest voter turnout of the 
21st century, and that turnout was 
higher across all demographics, as well 
as including minorities. 
More than 90 percent of Americans 
think it is easy to vote. More than a 
third of them think the rules should be 
more stringent than they are today, 
and there is a good argument for that. 
But that argument is prevailing right 
now. 
So once you see that the Democrats’ 
Big Lie of rampant voter suppression is 
clearly false, why are they pushing this 
election takeover bill? They want to 
nationalize elections, putting the Fed-
eral Government in charge of some-
thing that the Constitution clearly 
says belongs to the State. 
And just a few examples of what the 
bill would do: It would line the pockets 
of candidates with taxpayer dollars in 
order to run for office. It would restrict 
commonsense voter ID, supported by 
over 75 percent of the Americans, and 
mandate mail-in ballots and allow bal-
lot 
trafficking—trafficking, 
that 
is 
when 
the 
unsupervised 
political 
operatives collect and submit absentee 
ballots—and it would make election 
day a Federal holiday, costing some-
where close to $1 billion each time that 
it would be used. 
Now, you don’t have to take my word 
for it on how radical this is. Okla-
homa’s election board secretary—keep 
in mind, as in most States, it is non-
political, nonpartisan in any way, and 
the guy’s name is Paul Ziriax. He has 
called SCHUMER’s legislation a ‘‘recipe 
for chaos.’’ 
Democrats can feel the American 
people turning against their agenda. 
And so they are desperate to rig elec-
tions in their favor, and they will do so 
by whatever means necessary—even 
killing rules that make the Senate the 
Senate. 
This would poison bipartisan com-
promise in the Senate forever. My 
Democratic colleagues want you to for-
get that they were for the filibuster be-
fore they were against it. Just 5 years 
ago, 33 Senate Democrats, including 
then-Senator HARRIS, penned a letter 
demanding that we defend and retain it 
forever. So they were demanding that 
we retain the filibuster. But now they 
changed their mind, which means that 
they either have amnesia or that they 
see an opportunity to force their rad-
ical agenda on the American families. 
If Democrats get their way on the fil-
ibuster, they won’t stop taking over 
our elections. They will also pass their 
Green New Deal, their abortion on de-
mand, amnesty, and pack the Supreme 
Court with activists to uphold their 
unconstitutional agenda. 
I want to close by sharing a comment 
on the filibuster. The quote is this: 
Getting rid of the filibuster has long-term 
consequences. If there’s one thing that I 
have learned in my years here, once you 
change the rules and surrender the Senate’s 
institutional power, you never get it back. 
Now, I didn’t say that. That was said 
by President Joe Biden. He said it just 
in those words, and that might be the 
first time that we agree on something. 
Likewise, Senator SCHUMER also said 
that getting rid of the legislative fili-
buster would be ‘‘doomsday for democ-
racy.’’ And I happen to agree with him 
on that, too. 
I have served the people of Oklahoma 
in the Senate longer than anyone in 
history, and I feel strongly that the 
one thing that has protected our demo-
cratic Republic and ensured bipartisan-
ship more than any other single thing 
is the Senate’s protection of the voice 
of the minority. 
That is what we are famous for. 
There is no one else that has that as a 
function to do it, and yet I am seeing 
some of the things that are going on 
right now. 
President Biden said—keep this in 
mind—back in 2005: We have got to 
keep the filibuster. 
Then in 2021, just the other day, he 
said: We have got to kill the filibuster. 
He said that yesterday. 
Senator SCHUMER, back in 2005, said 
killing the filibuster will be ‘‘dooms-
day for democracy,’’ and now SCHUMER 
wants to kill the filibuster. 
Senator COONS said, back in 2018: ‘‘I 
am committed to never voting to 
change the legislative filibuster.’’ And 
now he is supporting killing the fili-
buster. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR, back in 2017, 
said: ‘‘Let’s keep that 60-vote threshold 
in place,’’ which is the filibuster. 
And now she said, just a few days 
ago: ‘‘I would personally get rid of the 
filibuster.’’ 
So here is what we are faced with: We 
know what is right, and we know what 
is wrong. It is very clear. Yet they are 
desperately trying to take a position 
that they have had for a long period of 
time. So we will continue to protect it. 
Both the President and Senator SCHU-
MER are trying to kill the filibuster, 
and we are not going to let that hap-
pen. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, it is al-
ways an honor to address the people of 
the United States from the floor of the 
U.S. Senate, and tonight is no excep-
tion. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
Oklahoma for his wonderful remarks. 
In order to form a more perfect 
Union, our Founding Fathers gave us a 
government that filters the will of the 
majority through a deliberative proc-
ess of amendment and debate. For cen-
turies, this has meant that legislative 
change, while slower in the United 
States than in some other countries, is 
moderated 
through 
healthy 
com-
promises and informed by a greater 
number of voices. This, in turn, has 
tended to give us legislation that bene-
fits more Americans. 
In recent decades, one of the most 
important factors in this process has 
been the Senate filibuster. It is one of 
the defining characteristics that sets 
the Senate apart from the House, and I 
served in the House. I remember how 
frustrating it was to send bill after bill 
to the Senate only to watch those bills 
die. 
But because the House is set up on a 
more partisan basis, some of the bills 
we sent over here were pretty partisan. 
So the Senate has a chance to either 
look at those and reject them as purely 
partisan or, more frequently, take up 
bills that have been crafted on a bipar-
tisan basis in this body, and I respect 
that. 
The House is about simple majority 
rule, but the Senate, thanks in part to 
the filibuster, is defined by the rights 
of the minority party. Simply put, it 
gives the party not in power a voice to 
speak for forgotten Americans and for 
small States like Wyoming. 
I am continually amazed at the whip-
lash-inducing about-face that Senate 
Democrats are doing on this issue. It 
was mentioned earlier by the previous 
speaker. Senate Democrats may be try-
ing to end the filibuster today, but 
until recently, they sang a very dif-
ferent tune. As was pointed out, Major-
ity Leader SCHUMER, in 2005, said that 
abolishing 
the 
filibuster 
would 
be 
doomsday for democracy—doomsday. 
Majority Whip DURBIN said in 2018 that 
ending the filibuster would be the end 
of the Senate as was originally devised 
and created going back to our Found-
ing Fathers. Vice President HARRIS 
signed a letter in 2017, with 31 Demo-
cratic Senators, urging the protection 
of the filibuster. President Biden was 
also a big supporter of the filibuster, 
calling it a Senator’s right to require 
60 votes for legislation and claiming 
that efforts to undermine the filibuster 
are a ‘‘power grab’’ by the majority 
party. 
Well, today President Biden and Sen-
ate Democrats are trying to do just 
that, grab power. They are trying to 
overhaul our voting system by nuking 
the filibuster and seizing unchecked 
power. 
Some of their more levelheaded and 
forward-thinking colleagues really are 
hesitant to do that. To their great 
credit and to the benefit of the institu-
tion of the Senate, my colleagues 
KYRSTEN SINEMA and JOE MANCHIN rec-
ognize that what goes around comes 
around. Senator MANCHIN criticized the 
idea of a filibuster carve-out for elec-
tion takeover legislation saying that 
‘‘anytime there’s a carve-out, you eat 
the whole turkey.’’ There is nothing 
left. 
Senator SINEMA wrote in the Wash-
ington Post that Democrats had more 
to lose than gain by changing filibuster 
rules, noting that the best way to 
achieve 
durable 
lasting 
results 
is 
through bipartisan cooperation. 
You know, I agree. We saw earlier 
this year, the infrastructure bill was 
the product of bipartisan discussion,

January 12, 2022 
and it produced legislation that had an 
overwhelming majority of the votes in 
the Senate. Now, I was not a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on that bill. I was a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
that bill. I felt it spent too much 
money, but I will say this. It was a fine 
work product that was developed by 
people of good will in both parties. 
They accepted ideas that I had and 
that others of us had who eventually 
voted against the bill, and they worked 
tirelessly for months. They would not 
give up because they recognized that 
when you can get a significant major-
ity in this Senate to support something 
on a bipartisan basis, you have a better 
product for the Nation. 
And I will say, I am proud of their 
work. I compliment them as frequently 
as I can for that work product, even 
though I didn’t vote for it. It was an 
example of true bipartisanship, a true 
bipartisan compromise. 
That is another reason that I have 
worked with my friend from Arizona 
Senator SINEMA and with my friend 
from Oregon RON WYDEN on financial 
innovation. I had never met RON 
WYDEN until that bill. That infrastruc-
ture bill came to the floor, and it had 
an amendment on the definition of 
broker that would apply in financial 
innovation instances. It did not ade-
quately represent what really happens 
in the world of digital assets. 
So Senator WYDEN and I met here on 
the floor. We became friends and start-
ed working on financial innovation 
issues, digital assets. And even though 
we were unsuccessful in changing the 
definition of ‘‘broker’’ in that bill, it 
forged a working friendship that I am 
confident will last for as long as I am 
here and as long as he is here together. 
That is one of the reasons that I have 
come to believe so strongly in the fili-
buster. I saw it work in that specific 
piece of legislation, even in my first 
year in the U.S. Senate. It is why I 
have worked with SHELDON
WHITE-
HOUSE from Rhode Island on a foreign 
agent registration reform. It is why I 
have worked with other Members of 
the other party on issues where we see 
more common ground than we see dif-
ferences. 
If you want lasting change, it re-
quires broad bipartisan support. Other-
wise, the next administration will 
work to overturn your actions. 
The last time Democrats changed the 
filibuster, it ultimately led to three 
Supreme Court Justices picked by 
President 
Trump. 
If 
Democrats 
thought that was bad, they should 
think carefully before changing the fil-
ibuster for other legislation. We should 
all think long and hard, as we prepare 
to vote, over this radical proposal. 
I implore my Democratic colleagues, 
consider when the Senate was in Re-
publican hands and when President 
Trump wanted Republicans to end the 
filibuster. Republicans rejected the Re-
publican President’s request to end the 
filibuster, and they did it out of respect 
for this institution. I am sure it was 
frustrating for the previous President. 
In some ways, it was frustrating for 
people like me. 
I was not in Washington during the 4 
years of the Trump Presidency. I was 
here during the 8 years of the Obama 
Presidency, serving in the House. I was 
not here during the Trump Presidency. 
I was back in Wyoming. In that time, 
you know, we were characterized as 
being a big red State, where a bunch of 
people in a ‘‘basket of deplorables’’—I 
was in there with them—were living 
and clinging to their guns and their Bi-
bles and we were treated like outcasts 
in our own country and it felt antago-
nistic. It was part of what creates this 
great divide that this country is in 
right now. That is how we felt about 
ourselves. 
I have to tell you, that is how we felt 
when President Biden went to Georgia 
and gave a speech and compared any-
one who didn’t support election reform 
to people like George Wallace. He com-
pared people in my State and me, quite 
frankly, to a bunch of racists. That 
rhetoric is so damaging to trying to 
heal this country. 
We all know our Nation is divided 
right now. Yesterday didn’t help. If we 
want a more perfect Union than we 
have today, we need more compromise, 
not less. That is why we have institu-
tional norms like the filibuster. When 
one party starts tearing up the norms, 
they might gain in the short term, but 
they do irreversible, lasting damage 
not only to our institutions but to our 
‘‘e pluribus unum,’’ ‘‘out of many, 
one.’’ If we want to be one, we should 
keep the filibuster in place. 
As those entrusted with the upkeep 
of our Constitution for future genera-
tions, we need to take a longer term 
view of what will be best for the coun-
try, not just our short-term political 
aspirations. Our Founders understood 
that the ends do not always justify the 
means. That is why we have the sepa-
ration of powers—two Chambers of 
Congress and a Bill of Rights that pro-
tects the individuals, that protects 
freedom. 
Sometimes 
you 
have 
to 
choose the harder right over the easier 
wrong. Compromise is hard. I will tell 
you, I am not all that good at it. I am 
trying to learn from the people in this 
Senate Chamber who are so successful 
at it. 
You know, the American people have 
placed a great deal of faith in each one 
of us to get this done. I have faith in us 
as well. 
I will admit that I really disliked my 
first year in this U.S. Senate. It was a 
huge disappointment to me. It was 
ugly. It was nasty. It seemed un-Amer-
ican. 
But I still have faith in us. We need 
to protect our institutions. One of 
those institutions is the filibuster. I 
think it will allow us to continue to be 
a nation that is out of many and yet is 
still one. God willing, that will be the 
case. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO RABBI MOSHE 
FELLER 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise to recognize Rabbi Moshe Feller 
for the beautiful prayer he offered us 
this week. He could be considered a 
prolific 
guest 
chaplain—having 
led 
both Houses of Congress in prayer a 
combined 10 times over the last several 
decades. Each time, his wisdom, his 
faith in God, and his regard for the 
work of this body have all shined 
through. Today was no exception. 
It was particularly special to know 
that he was joined by one of his sons, 
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Feller, as 
well as three of his grandchildren, 
Rabbi Tzemach Feller, Rabbi Yossi 
Feller, and Moussie Feller. I am con-
fident that his other son, Rabbi Levi 
Feller, and his many other grand-
children were excitedly watching from 
home. And I know that if Mindelle, 
Rabbi Moshe Feller’s wife of 56 years 
who passed away in 2017, were still with 
us today, she too would be so proud. 
I have had the honor of meeting 
Rabbi Feller many times over the 
years, and I am glad he was able to re-
turn to this Chamber today. 
In addition to being the longest serv-
ing Rabbi in Minnesota, Rabbi Feller 
leads 
the 
Upper 
Midwest 
Merkos 
Chabad Lubavitch in St. Paul and is a 
member 
of 
the 
board 
of 
Merkos 
L’Inyonei Chinuch, the education arm 
of the International Chabad movement. 
Through his work, he mentors and in-
spires people of all faiths in Minnesota 
and across the country. A passionate 
and dedicated leader, he has been in-
strumental in cultivating Jewish life in 
Minnesota, and his numerous contribu-
tions have enriched our State as a 
whole. 
Whether by overseeing the founding 
and establishment of over 30 Jewish in-
stitutions in the Midwest or by serving 
as a counselor and mentor to those 
seeking to grow closer to their faith, 
Rabbi Feller unwaveringly answers the 
call. 
With 
his 
remarks 
this 
morning, 
Rabbi Feller offered a clarion reminder

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and 
Mr. HAGERTY): 
S. 3492. A bill to address the impor-

tional security, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S191 
January 12, 2022 
by Senator HAGERTY, that addresses 
the importance of foreign affairs train-
ing to national security and, more spe-
cifically, intends to improve training 
and professional development of the 
Foreign Service officers and civil serv-
ice staff at the U.S. State Department. 
This act calls for the State Depart-
ment to move beyond its traditional 
approach towards a more robust profes-
sional training program, incorporating 
innovative 
education 
and 
training 
courses, methods, and opportunities. 
Employees of the State Department 
have a long, honorable tradition of pro-
viding excellence in diplomacy, but it 
is time to modernize the training and 
professional development they receive, 
enabling them to more effectively pro-
mote our national security interests 
abroad and ensuring the retention of 
our best and brightest employees. 
The legislation will accomplish the 
following: provide a more effective and 
updated training program for employ-
ees of the State Department, to include 
increased virtual instruction that is 
interactive and more accessible to per-
sonnel deployed around the world, as 
well as increased training provided by 
partner organizations such as univer-
sities, 
industry 
entities, 
and 
non-
governmental organization, NGOs: es-
tablish a Chief Learning Officer posi-
tion to serve as the principal adviser to 
the Secretary of State and strategist 
for State Department training and de-
velopment; and establish a nonpartisan 
Board of Visitors to provide inde-
pendent advice and recommendations 
regarding training at the Foreign Serv-
ice Institute. 
Other key elements of the legislation 
include establishment of a clear link 
between required employee training 
and promotional opportunities and as-
signments at the State Department; a 
‘‘training float’’ strategy that will 
allow 10 to 15 percent of Foreign Serv-
ice and civil service officers and staff 
to participate in training at any given 
time; a call for the State Department 
to establish new fellowship programs 
for Foreign Service and civil service of-
ficers and staff in addition to the cur-
rent Pearson and Brookings Fellowship 
Programs, allowing them to partici-
pate in short- and long-term opportuni-
ties at think tanks, nongovernmental 
organizations, the Department of De-
fense, industry entities, and relevant 
university programs; and establish-
ment of a Center for Innovation in 
Training and a Provost position at the 
Foreign Service Institute, to evaluate 
all courses and curriculum offered by 
FSI and identify necessary updates to 
meet the frequent changes required by 
officers due to changing global dynam-
ics. 
The Department of State is a crucial 
national security agency, whose em-
ployees, both Foreign Service and civil 
service, require the best possible train-
ing at every stage of their careers to 
prepare them to promote and defend 
U.S. national interests and the health 
and safety of U.S. citizens abroad. 
As chair of the Subcommittee on 
U.S. State Department and USAID 
Management, 
International 
Oper-
ations, and Bilateral International De-
velopment, along with Ranking Mem-
ber Senator HAGERTY, I have presided 
over the first two in a planned series of 
subcommittee hearings on moderniza-
tion of the State Department. The 
most recent hearing, held in November 
of last year, made clear that the nu-
merous studies issued about the State 
Department’s need to change its cul-
ture, starting with an innovative train-
ing and professional development pro-
gram, were on the mark. 
During the hearing, we heard that 
‘‘everything is fine’’ at State in terms 
of training, while the Department’s re-
tention rate indicates the loss of expe-
rienced Foreign Service officers and 
civil servants. External witnesses Am-
bassador David Miller, president of the 
Diplomatic Studies Foundation, and 
Joshua Marcuse, who formerly served 
as the Executive Director of the De-
fense Innovation Board, painted a very 
different picture, calling for an over-
arching effort to change the culture of 
the State Department—which as one of 
the oldest Federal Departments is 
steeped in tradition and protocol—to 
transform it once again into the lead 
Agency executing American foreign 
policy overseas. 
The level of challenges the State De-
partment faces now around the world 
are almost unprecedented, with the re-
turn of great power competition, the 
rise of authoritarianism, the collapse 
of Afghanistan, climate change, the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and—not least— 
assisting American citizens around the 
world. 
Professional 
education 
and 
training must be top priorities at the 
State 
Department, 
and 
we 
must 
strengthen the professionalization of 
our diplomats through a career-long 
program that focuses on mastery of 
substantive foreign policy issues, diplo-
matic expertise, superb customer serv-
ice for American citizens abroad, and 
leadership. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
gave a speech last fall on ‘‘Modernizing 
American Diplomacy,’’ and one of the 
five pillars he described is that of 
building and retaining a diverse, dy-
namic, and entrepreneurial workforce, 
and empowering and equipping State 
Department employees to succeed. This 
bill will kick-start the rebuilding ef-
fort Mr. Blinken spoke about, putting 
the emphasis on training and profes-
sional development of the Depart-
ment’s greatest asset: its people. 
I remain committed to continuing to 
work with the Biden administration 
and my colleagues in Congress to pro-
vide every opportunity for State De-
partment employees to receive the best 
possible training at every stage of their 
careers, to prepare them to promote 
and defend U.S. national interests and 
the health and safety of U.S. citizens 
abroad. 
By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and 
Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 3493. A bill to require guidance on 
extending expiration dates for certain 
drugs, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to highlight legislation I am in-
troducing with the senior Senator from 
Maine, Ms. COLLINS, to address pre-
scription drug shortages. We rely on 
prescription drugs to battle infectious 
diseases like SARS–CoV–2, for the 
treatment of cancer and hormonal dis-
orders and in countless other facets of 
modern medicine. When drug short-
ages, which are unforeseen supply dis-
ruptions, occur, healthcare teams must 
scramble to develop new plans of care 
because the optimal treatment is no 
longer available. The Drug Shortages 
Shelf Life Extension Act will help 
tackle drug shortages by enabling the 
Food and Drug Administration, FDA, 
to extend the shelf of certain drugs at 
risk of shortage in a safe fashion. 
Prescription drug shortages are a 
persistent problem, leading to dimin-
ished access to vital medications and 
potentially catastrophic outcomes for 
patients. FDA wrote in its 2019 Drug 
Shortages Task Force Report that dis-
carding drugs if they exceed an unnec-
essarily short expiration date can exac-
erbate drug shortages. Essentially, the 
shelf life for certain drugs can be safely 
extended, and I support empowering 
authorities to do so to prevent drug 
shortages. 
Last year, I introduced the Drug 
Shortages Prevention & Quality Im-
provement Act. The legislation would 
address some of the main causes of 
drug shortages and provide solutions to 
mitigate their effects. The legislation 
would give the FDA additional tools to 
mitigate drug shortages, such as ex-
tending shelf lives for certain essential 
drugs. This legislation also seeks to ad-
dress prescription drug shortages by 
creating incentives for manufacturers 
to upgrade their facilities to prevent 
shortages. Some of the facilities FDA 
has tied to drug shortages have been 
operating continually since the 1960s 
with minimal upgrades to manufac-
turing lines and facilities. The FDA 
Drug Shortages Task Force report 
found that quality concerns caused 62 
percent of drug shortages from 2013 to 
2017. 
Last April, Senate Health, 
Edu-
cation, Labor and Pensions, HELP, 
Committee Chair MURRAY and Ranking 
Member BURR announced plans to de-
velop a bipartisan initiative to prepare 
the Nation for future public health 
emergencies in light of the COVID–19 
pandemic. I applaud this effort to mod-
ernize our national response efforts for 
the 
current 
pandemic 
and 
future 
pandemics and look forward to consid-
eration of this legislation on the floor 
of the Senate. I was particularly 
pleased to see language included in the 
HELP Committee’s discussion draft for 
this preparedness initiative from the 
Drug Shortages Shelf Life Extension 
Act. Extending shelf lives of certain

January 12, 2022 
drugs is not only critical to prevent 
drug shortages but also to enable our 
prescription drug supply chain to be 
more responsive and better prepared to 
respond to public health emergencies. 
Domestically, we continue to battle 
the COVID–19 pandemic. We are near-
ing record-high hospitalizations due to 
COVID–19, including record-high levels 
for children. In my State of Maryland, 
we have encountered a new record-high 
hospitalization level every day since 
December 29. For many patients, the 
severity and mortality rates are lower 
due to higher vaccination levels and 
better treatments gleaned from our ex-
perience in battling COVID–19 so far, 
but these high hospitalization rates are 
straining an already overburdened sys-
tem. 
As we continue fighting the pan-
demic, in addition to other diseases 
and illnesses, timely access to medica-
tions is essential for our healthcare 
providers and their patients. The Drug 
Shortages Shelf Life Extension Act 
would require FDA to update guidance 
tied to manufacturer testing of the 
shelf life of prescription drug and to re-
port to Congress on actions taken to 
update the shelf life dates of relevant 
drugs. Shelf life expiration dates are 
established through regulations gov-
erning prescription drug stability test-
ing, which need to be reexamined since 
they have not been amended since 1981. 
I look forward to working with the 
Biden administration as it implements 
this essential legislation and related 
regulations. 
I urge my colleagues to join Senator 
COLLINS and me in support of the Drug 
Shortages Shelf Life Extension Act to 
improve access to essential prescrip-
tion drugs and to prevent or mitigate 
future drug shortages. No one should 
have to go without essential prescrip-
tions drugs when usable supplies are 
available but have potentially inac-
curate use-by dates stamped on their 
box or bottle.

GIME 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. BRAUN, and Mr. RUBIO) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 489 
Whereas on July 11, 2021, protestors in 
more than 40 cities marched in the streets of 
Cuba to exercise their fundamental right to 
peacefully assemble and express their opposi-
tion to the Cuban regime, resulting in the 
largest anti-government demonstration on 
the island in decades; 
Whereas the Cuban protestors, in a clear 
message— 
(1) called for an end to communism, cen-
sorship, and oppression in Cuba; and 
(2) demanded basic human rights and their 
God-given freedom; 
Whereas during the July 2021 protests, in a 
crude and savage effort to silence the Cuban 
people, the Communist party— 
(1) deployed a wave of terror throughout 
Cuba by unleashing its secret police and 
military forces on the peaceful protestors; 
(2) harassed and threatened men, women, 
and children, some of whom were in their 
homes; 
(3) abducted and tortured civil society 
leaders; and 
(4) detained more than 1,300 Cubans, ac-
cording to media reports; 
Whereas Felix Navarro Rodriguez, a re-
nowned pro-democracy activist who was ar-
rested during the ‘‘Black Spring’’ of 2003, is 
the President of the Pedro Luis Boitel Abra-
ham Democracy Party, and is a member of 
the Executive Secretariat of the Democratic 
Action Unity Table (MUAD), was arrested, 
then charged with the alleged crime of ‘‘at-
tack and public disorder’’, after merely ap-
pearing at a police unit in Cuba to inquire 
about the status of members of his group 
who were detained during the July 11 pro-
test; 
Whereas in August 2021, Felix Navarro 
Rodriguez, in protest of his unlawful arrest, 
the terrible conditions in which he was being 
held and the cruelty he suffered in prison, 
went on a hunger strike for 30 days, remains 
isolated, is in a delicate state of health, and 
is restricted from communicating with his 
family; 
Whereas Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcia, leader 
of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), is 
a Cuban human rights and democracy activ-
ist, who has worked incessantly to promote 
fundamental civil liberties for the Cuban 
people; 
Whereas Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcia, who 
was born in Santiago de Cuba on July 29, 
1970, has dedicated most of his adult life in 
peaceful protest against Cuba’s brutal and 
totalitarian Communist dictatorship to en-
sure that Cubans are allowed to have a voice 
in matters concerning their own country; 
Whereas Jose´
Daniel Ferrer Garcia was 
among the hundreds of activists who were 
unlawfully detained by the Cuban regime 
and has been unjustly imprisoned in isola-
tion for nearly 180 days, where he has been 
subjected to physical and psychological tor-
ture by the brutal Communist Cuban regime; 
Whereas according to Jose´ Daniel Ferrer 
Garcia’s family, his health is dire, he is suf-
fering from severe headaches, mouth bleed-
ing, malnutrition, bouts of coughing, and the 
inability to sleep, all of which was caused by 
the cruel torture and inhumane treatment 
he received from the Cuban regime; 
Whereas a host of other pro-democracy ac-
tivists have been imprisoned solely for 
peacefully exercising their rights to freedom 
of expression, including Ciro Alexis Casa-
novas Pe´rez, Loreto Herna´ndez Garcı´a and 
wife, Donaida Pe´rez Paseiro, Didier Eduardo 
Almagro 
Toledo, 
Nidia 
Bienes 
Paseiro, 
Demis Valde´s Sarduy, Misael Dı´az Paseiro, 
Arianna Lo´pez Roque, twin sisters Lisdani 
Rodrı´guez Isaac and Lisdiani Rodrı´guez 
Isaac, and Ivan Hernandez Carrillo; 
Whereas during the week of Christmas 
2021, many of these peaceful demonstrators 
were convicted on charges of sedition and 
sentenced to decades in prison just for de-
manding basic human rights; and 
Whereas the totalitarian regime is terri-
fied of brave and courageous leaders who 
stand resolute in fighting for a free Cuba, 
and will persecute, kidnap, torture, or kill 
anyone who stands up against their tyranny: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the repression of Jose´ Daniel 
Ferrer Garcia and all brave Cuban activists, 
and demands their immediate and uncondi-
tional release from prison; 
(2) condemns the brutal torture and inhu-
mane treatment of Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcia 
by the Cuban regime and calls for an imme-
diate humanitarian medical visit by an inde-
pendent human rights organization to him 
and to all political prisoners who have been 
unjustly and illegally detained by the Cuban 
regime since July 11, 2021; 
(3) condemns Cuba’s brutal totalitarian 
Communist dictatorship and demands an end 
to the suffering of the Cuban people and the 
impunity of the Cuban regime’s human 
rights abusers; 
(4) calls for the international community 
to stand with the Cuban people and against 
Cuba’s totalitarian Communist regime for 
infringing on the freedom of thought, will, 
expression, assembly, and prosperity of the 
Cuban people; and 
(5) commends the courage of the pro-de-
mocracy movement and all freedom activists 
in Cuba for risking everything to bring free-
dom to the Cuban people.

HONORING THE LIFE OF OHIO 
STATE SENATOR EDNA BROWN 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with a heavy heart to pay tribute to distin-
guished Ohio Senator Edna Brown, a trail-
blazer who recently passed away. 
Edna Brown was a remarkable public serv-
ant from Toledo, Ohio, who dedicated her life 
and her three decades of service to improving 
the well-being and future of our community. 
As the first and only African American to 
represent Lucas County in the Ohio Senate, 
she blazed a trail for many to follow at the 
highest level of elected office in Ohio. 
She was a warm, inviting, and immensely 
kind person whose focus was always on pub-
lic service and bettering the lives of the people 
she served, the people she truly loved. 
Northwest Ohio lost a great champion. Her 
family lost a great mother and grandmother. 
America needs more people like Edna Brown 
in public service. 
Her memory will live with us, and I know her 
legacy will inspire the next generation of 
Ohio’s leaders, including women leaders. 
I include in the RECORD her life story and 
obituary as a tribute to her persevering ac-
complishments for our Nation’s betterment. 
Godspeed, Edna Brown. May the angels carry 
her very high, and may she rest in her peace. 
. 
SENATOR EDNA BROWN BIOGRAPHY 
Edna Brown was elected to serve Ohio’s 
11th Senate District in November, 2010. She 
came from the Ohio House of Representa-
tives, where she served Ohio’s 48th House 
District. The Toledo native was a public 
school graduate who attended the University 
of Toledo and Mary Manse College. Her dedi-
cation to public service led to a 32–year ca-
reer as an employee with the city of Toledo, 
followed by a six-year tenure on Toledo City 
Council. 
She moved to the Statehouse in January 
2002 to fill the House seat of then newly- 
elected Toledo mayor Jack Ford. Since her 
arrival, she worked tirelessly on issues of 
voting 
rights, 
health, 
violence 
against 
women and economic development. 
Her idea to bring ‘‘no excuse’’ absentee 
voting to Ohio was incorporated into a bill 
that became state law in January 2006. For 
her efforts, the Ohio Association of Election 
Officials and the Ohio Secretary of State 
honored her with the Jack Wolfe Memorial 
Award as one of two ‘‘Legislators of the 
Year.’’ In 2007, Brown introduced a bill to 
immunize young women from the human 
papilloma virus, and a bill addressing vio-
lence in teen dating relationships. 
Senator Brown served as a member of the 
House Finance & Appropriations Committee 
and as Chair of the Human Services Sub-
committee. She also served on the House 
Commerce and Labor Committee, the Elec-
tions and Ethics Committee, and the Com-
merce and Labor Committee. Senator Brown 
sat on the Ohio Commission on Minority 
Health Board and served as Chair of the Ohio 
Children’s Trust Fund. She was a member of 
the House Cancer Caucus. 
Senator Brown was the First Vice Presi-
dent of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, 
and served on the Executive Committee the 
National Black Caucus of State Legislators. 
She also worked as state director for WILL/ 
WAND, a non-partisan national organization 
for women legislators. 
Senator Brown was very active in her 
hometown. She was instrumental in found-
ing the Greater Toledo Urban League and sat 
on the Board of Directors. She was a past 
chair 
of 
the 
Administration 
Board 
for 
Braden United Methodist Church, and was a 
charter member of the Executive Women’s 
Golf Association. 
All of her efforts garnered Senator Brown 
numerous awards. She won an inaugural 
‘‘ROSA’’ Award from the Toledo Board of 
Community Relations for living a life par-
allel to the example set by civil rights leader 
Rosa Parks. The Toledo YWCA also honored 
Brown as a 2007 Milestone Award recipient 
for her contributions and achievements and 
WILL/WAND honored her with a Pacesetter 
Award the same year. 
SENATOR EDNA BROWN OBITUARY 
Senator Edna R. Brown, a Servant to To-
ledo, Mentor to many and Friend to all, 
passed away peacefully in her home, Satur-
day, January 1, 2022. 
She was born in Tuscaloosa Alabama, April 
4, 1940, the oldest of ten children, to the 
union of Mr. and Mrs. Charlie and Pauline 
Hutton. She relocated to Toledo in 1952, at-
tended The Jesup W. High Scott her fresh-
man year in 1954 and graduated from The 
Harriett E. Whitney Vocational High School 
in 1958 and attended what was known as 
Mary Manse College and the University of 
Toledo. While at the University of Toledo, 
she accepted a position with the City of To-
ledo, which led to a 32–year career serving 
the Toledo Communities. 
After retirement from the City of Toledo, 
Senator Brown began her career as an elect-
ed official. She was sworn into office Janu-
ary 3, 1994, to serve on Toledo City Council. 
When the late Jack Ford resigned from The 
Ohio House of Representatives to become 
Mayor of Toledo, Edna was appointed to 
serve the remainder of his term. Representa-
tive Brown was elected to a full term in 2002 
and was re-elected four times. In 2010 Sen-
ator Brown won the Ohio State Senator seat, 
where she served as the Minority Whip and 
represented the 11th Senate District from 
2011 until her retirement, December 31, 2018. 
During her political career, Senator Brown 
sponsored and or co-sponsored legislation to 
benefit Veterans and their Families, Women, 
Children, and the Elderly. She was the origi-
nal sponsor of the ‘‘NO EXCUSE’’ absentee 
voting for Ohio in 2005 and was the primary 
sponsor of HB 10 which addressed violence in 
teen dating. She proudly sponsored a bill to 
create Special License Plates for members of 
the Ohio Grand Lodge of Prince Hall Masons. 
Senator Brown was preceded in death by 
parents; husband of 40 years Willie Brown; 
daughter, Carol Lewis; brothers, Charlie 
Hutton, Jr. and Joseph D. Hutton. She leaves 
to cherish her loving memory: daughters, 
Linda Armstrong, Christine Brown Daniels 
(Dayton OH) and Kathy (Johnado) Dadzie; 
thirteen grand and great-grandchildren; sis-
ters Imogene Lott, Lula (Ruben) Aldridge 
and Essie Powell (Dayton, OH); brothers, 
Johnny Hutton and Dr. Thomas (Lucille) 
Hutton. Services of Remembrance for Sen-
ator Brown will be Private. The family re-
quests, in lieu of flowers, donations be made 
to The Braden United Methodist Church. 
‘‘I have always strived to improve the lives 
of others, and find solace in knowing that I 
gave my all to the people of Lucas County,’’ 
Senator Edna Brown.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO J. CARTER 
SEIBEL 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to J. Carter Seibel, who 
passed away on December 28, 2021 at sev-
enty-four years of age. A resident of Delta, 
Pennsylvania for nearly fifty years, Carter was 
a friend to many in the community. Nowhere 
was that more evident than during his time as 
a teacher at North Harford High School in 
Pylesville, Maryland where he taught for over 
two decades, touching the lives of countless 
students. 
He established a German language program 
at North Harford, advised on the school’s 
yearbook, and offered up his musical talents 
playing piano in the school’s musicals. His 
love of music and the piano brought joy to 
many in the community as he played at nu-
merous weddings and events, including some 
hosted by his former students. Carter also 
loved Delta as well, serving as a member of 
the Borough Council and working on initiatives 
aimed at promoting the borough. 
We extend our sincere condolences to his 
wife, Cindy, as well as his children and grand-
children on Carter’s passing. He will be 
missed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E30 
January 12, 2022 
Bronco Marching Band celebrated its 100th 
season on the field. As a former member of 
the Michigan Marching Band, I can attest that 
no college football game day is complete with-
out the sights and sounds of a marching band, 
particularly in Michigan. Since its inception in 
1915, the Bronco Marching Band has been a 
staple within the greater Kalamazoo and 
Michigan communities, and a fixture on 
WMU’s campus, both at home and away 
sporting events, and at many other university 
occasions, such as its Annual Concert open to 
all members of the community. The BMB 
Football Pre-game and Half-time Perform-
ances are honored as recognizing timely and 
creative themes, regularly recognizing the 
BMB as ‘‘The Best Band in the MAC.’’ The 
Bronco Marching Band serves as the keeper 
and curator of WMU traditions, providing the 
expected soundtrack for returning alumni in a 
way that recordings cannot. Its performances 
off campus have even broader impact through 
parades, exhibitions, and community service, 
including performances and media appear-
ances 
in 
numerous 
Kalamazoo 
Holiday 
Events. Over the years, the BMB has also 
brought national attention to Michigan, Kala-
mazoo, and WMU during appearances at the 
International Bowl, Texas Bowl, Little Caesar’s 
Pizza Bowl, Famous Idaho Potato Bowls (2), 
Cotton Bowl, First Responder Bowl, and the 
Quick Lane Bowl in Detroit. The BMB’s dedi-
cated 300+ members and staff, and thousands 
of BMB Alumni, have brought joy and Bronco 
Spirit to millions over the past century with hits 
such as ‘‘I’ve Got a Girl in Kalamazoo,’’ and 
‘‘Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight,’’ as well 
as the beloved Bronco Fight Song. Congratu-
lations again to the WMU Bronco Marching 
Band on this major milestone. I look forward to 
seeing what you achieve in the next 100 
years. Go Broncos.

THE U.S. ECONOMY REMAINS #1 IN 
2021, BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR FU-
TURE? 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Mrs. McCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD the following op-ed. 
MANY PUBLIC POLICY CONCERNS 
While many public policy issues are great-
ly concerning—from COVID–19 to the crisis 
at our southern border to education gaps rel-
ative to our ability to compete economi-
cally—in our opinion, the following three are 
paramount for the U.S. Congress and Biden 
Administration. 
THE SHRINKING INFLUENCE OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND NORTH AMERICA 
In 1960, North American total global GDP 
was $597.42 billion or 43.7%, with the U.S. 
contributing $543 billion or just under 40 per-
cent of the total global GDP of $l.367 trillion 
(China’s 1960 global GDP by comparison was 
$59.72 billion or $4.39%). 
China’s 2021 global GDP grew to about 
$16.86 trillion or 17.86% of total global GDP. 
Comparatively, 2021 North American GDP 
declined to 27.9% of total global GDP, while 
Asia—led by China, Japan, lndia, and South 
Korea—produced 33.7% of global GDP and ex-
tended its faster growth pace lead to more 
than two decades. 
AN OBJECTIVE AND REALISTIC VIEW OF CHINA IS 
NEEDED MORE THAN EVER IN WASHINGTON D.C. 
On December 29, 2021 the Chinese Com-
munist Party ordered Hong Kong police to 
raid the headquarters of Stand News, a pro- 
democracy Hong Kong-based news service 
critical of government policy coming out of 
Beijing. Seven Stand employees were ar-
rested, and all remaining employees were 
dismissed. China’s action is another viola-
tion of the Sino-British agreement signed in 
1997 giving Hong Kong economic and polit-
ical freedom until 2047. The West, and espe-
cially the United States, must not continue 
to turn a blind eye toward China’s treatment 
of Hong Kong. 
We also must reverse the current trend 
which has allowed China to gain superior 
numbers of military assets to ours in the 
South China Sea and off the coasts of our nu-
merous Asian allies. As tensions grow with 
China over Taiwan, we must acknowledge 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s com-
ment: ‘‘the U.S. will pay an unbearable 
price’’ if we continue to support Taiwan. Our 
response must speak with conviction and 
specificity of the consequences China will 
suffer economically and potentially mili-
tarily if it moves against Taiwan, an impor-
tant U.S. economic partner and champion of 
freedom and free enterprise. 
With shortages of face masks to battle 
COVID–19 and computer chip delays that 
have challenged American automobile manu-
facturers, it should be apparent to both U.S. 
producers and consumers that U.S. busi-
nesses must rethink their previous supply 
chain strategy and be encouraged to produce 
more necessities at home. 
Further, we must rally the world and hold 
China responsible for the COVID–19 outbreak 
and its consequences. It’s the right thing to 
do and the only way to prevent a future out-
break. 
We applaud Congress for passing a bill tar-
geting China over Uyghur-forced labor prac-
tices. The measure prohibits imports from 
the Xinjiang region of China unless compa-
nies can prove the products were made with-
out forced labor. We hope President Biden 
signs it immediately and more is done by the 
U.S. government and U.S. corporations to 
protect the rights and freedoms of Muslim 
Uyghurs living in China. 
Broadening our view of China further, The 
Hill recently posited: Should a weakening 
and unstable Chinese economic model be as 
great a concern as a rising China? The an-
swer is yes. China’s concern over energy 
shortages, slowing economic growth and pro-
ductivity, and debt now at 290% of GDP, 
demonstrates that confidence in the Chinese 
economic and political structure is teetering 
from within. In addition, recent crackdowns 
on the property and technology sectors will 
result in less flexibility and greater eco-
nomic authoritarianism control over two 
sectors that account for 29 percent of Chi-
nese GDP. 
Our concerns regarding Chinese economic 
stability and their ability to execute their 5- 
year planning model hopefully will be a 
cause for concern within the greater Com-
munist Party of China. Exposing the growing 
fragility and incompetence of the Chinese 
economic model could provide a boost for 
pro-market reform party members as they 
vote at the 2022 Communist Party Congress 
this fall. Open, honest and regular commu-
nication of China’s current economic struc-
tural weaknesses could help market-friendly 
party members use data to thwart Xi 
Jinping’s ambition to be only the third lead-
er in the party’s 100-year history elected to 
a third term. Perhaps a modern Chinese 
version of ’Radio-free Europe’ would be use-
ful in the months ahead? 
U.S. ENERGY POLICY CONTINUES TO MAKE NO 
SENSE TO US 
Oil prices continue to fluctuate, declining 
to the mid-$60’s range weeks ago only to re-
bound to more than $77 a barrel currently. 
Many energy experts believe oil could trade 
at more than $100 a barrel in 2022 if the Biden 
Administration continues its illogical en-
ergy policy. Remember that U.S. oil and nat-
ural gas are among the cleanest carbon- 
based fuels by category available in the 
world today. In fact, U.S. production of clean 
fossil fuels has dramatically reduced the U.S. 
carbon footprint, making it the global leader 
in carbon reduction in the industrialized 
world over the last 30 years. However, if 
cleaner U.S. oil and natural gas continue to 
be removed from the U.S. and world markets 
due to the Biden Administration’s policies, 
five nonsensical results will occur: 1) The 
policy will enhance the political and public 
policy initiatives of countries unfriendly to 
democracy like Russia and Iran; 2) European 
allies will become more dependent on un-
friendly nations for their oil and natural gas 
needs, thereby weakening the security and 
economic prowess of Europe and the United 
States; 3) More ‘‘dirtier’’ Russian and Ira-
nian oil and natural gas on global markets 
coupled with less from the U.S. means a sus-
tained increase of lower quality and higher 
polluting fossil fuel products on global en-
ergy markets (in effect, the Biden Adminis-
tration’s policy will increase the global car-
bon footprint rather than reduce it, making 
the policy anti-green rather than the pro- 
green policy it’s currently being promoted to 
represent); 4) The policy will employ thou-
sands of Russians and Iranians in high-pay-
ing oil industry-related jobs when those good 
jobs could be here in the United States with 
workers paying taxes to the United States; 
and, 5) Billions of dollars of local, state and 
federal tax revenue from U.S. oil companies 
will be lost to the U.S. government at all 
levels in the months and years ahead. 
CONCLUSION 
The U.S. National Debt currently stands at 
$29.62 trillion (over $89,000 per U.S. man, 
woman, and child and just under $237,000 per 
U.S. taxpayer). Much of the current state of 
our national debt is due to excessive govern-
ment spending on programs that are not 
needed while taking capital from private sec-
tor investments and U.S. national defense. It 
is crucial that U.S. fiscal, monetary and for-
eign policy focus on strategies that will grow 
U.S. capital investment, private sector job 
and economic growth, while defending the 
United States and our key allies. This is the 
only way to ensure that the United States 
will remain the world’s only economic and 
military superpower.

HONORING MR. J. DAVID 
VANDERVEEN 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Mr. J. David VanderVeen on 
his retirement after 55 years of devoted serv-
ice as director of Oakland County International 
Airport. 
Mr. VanderVeen first took the reins as direc-
tor of the airport on February 25, 1967—sev-
eral years before the position of Oakland 
County county executive was even estab-
lished. Since then, he’s served under three 
elected county executives, seven Michigan 
governors, and a whopping eleven presidential 
administrations. Madam Speaker, to put this 
into perspective, Mr. VanderVeen has helmed 
the county airport longer than one-third of the 
Members of this Chamber have been alive. 
However, beyond his record-breaking ten-
ure, Mr. VanderVeen’s accomplishments in 
that time truly stand out. Today, the runways 
at Oakland County International Airport capa-
bly handle an average of 120,000 takeoffs and 
landings per year, ranking it the twelfth-busiest 
general aviation airport in the world. In addi-
tion, over 150 corporations and more than 554 
aircraft have entrusted the airport to serve as 
a base of operations, which contributes $1 bil-
lion annually to the local economy of south-
east Michigan. 
Even our state’s notorious winter storms, 
the bane of so many airports across the Mid-
west, 
have 
been 
no 
match 
for 
Mr. 
VanderVeen. Among his proudest achieve-
ments is that the runways never once closed 
due to snow or ice—the airport’s steadfast 
ground crews have worked around the clock 
to keep them operational, including in 1982 
when football fans flew in from all over the 
country to see Super Bowl XVI at the Pontiac 
Silverdome. 
Simply put, for more than half a century, Mr. 
VanderVeen’s leadership has been a touch-
stone of Oakland County government. He 
doesn’t just have institutional knowledge, he is 
the institution. And while others may have 
come and gone, Mr. VanderVeen has re-
mained at his post, helping his colleagues as 
they navigate the challenges of a dynamic 
county and growing community. 
Several years ago, when Oakland County’s 
first county executive, Daniel T. Murphy, 
passed away, Mr. VandenVeen spoke at a 
service for his former boss, remarking that, 
‘‘Dan Murphy set the bar high for political 
leaders in this state.’’ 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that, like 
Mr. Murphy, Mr. VanderVeen has similarly set 
the bar high for public servants—both in our 
state and across our nation. He has been an 
instrumental part of the county’s success 
story, and there is no question he leaves his 
successor enormous shoes to fill. 
While I understand that Mr. VanderVeen will 
continue to represent the current county exec-
utive on the county’s parks and recreation and 
airport committees, I know I speak for every-
one when I say that he’s more than earned 
some well-deserved time off. 
To his friends and loved ones, particularly 
his wife, Shelagh, his four children, eight 
grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren, 
may they enjoy the time they now have to 
spend with him. And to all of my colleagues, 
may we take a page from Mr. VanderVeen’s 
playbook and strive, as he did, to always put 
service before self. It’s my honor to spotlight 
his incredible accomplishments.

HONORING AND COMMENDING THE 
WORK OF GRANT DUBOIS 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and commend the work of Mr. Grant 
Dubois in his tenure as the President of the 
Rockwall County Republican Men’s Club. 
Mr. Dubois has served as the Rockwall 
County Republican Men’s Club for three con-
secutive years from 2019 to 2021 and was the 
youngest President in the club’s history. As 
President, he facilitated a change in meeting 
venues from city park to a larger, more ac-
commodating facility located in downtown 
Rockwall. The change in venue allowed for 
the club’s growth. 
Mr. Dubois also oversaw the two most suc-
cessful fundraising golf tournaments the club 
has ever hosted. This golf tournament is 
named in honor of former member Ralph Hall. 
Perhaps his greatest accomplishment in his 
three years as the President of the Rockwall 
County Republican Men’s Club is the record 
breaking growth in club membership. Despite 
the constraints of the pandemic, his tenure 
saw the club grow from 130 members to over 
200. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
the devotion of Mr. Grant Dubois to the 
Rockwall County Republican Men’s Club. May 
God bless him and the future of the Rockwall 
County Republican Men’s Club.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
TRICENTEN-
NIAL 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
TOWN OF HAMPTON FALLS, NEW 
HAMPSHIRE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the tricentennial anniversary of 
the establishment of the Town of Hampton 
Falls, New Hampshire. Known as the Third 
Parish of Hampton prior to 1722, Hampton 
Falls was aptly renamed after falls on the Tay-
lor River, their water used to power the 
watermills central to the town’s early indus-
tries. 
The earliest residents of Hampton Falls 
worked on farms and in the timber industry. 
The town has stayed close to these roots, re-
maining heavily invested in farmland. Hampton 
Falls is home to Applecrest Orchards, the 
town’s largest employer, New Hampshire’s 
oldest and largest orchard and the oldest con-
tinuously operated orchard in the nation. 
In 1735, a mere 13 years after its establish-
ment, Hampton Falls fell victim to a horrible 
bout of Throat Distemper that caused more 
than 200 deaths in the small population of less 
than 500, and that left only two homes in the 
community untouched. Since those troubling 
times, the town has flourished, reaching a 
population of more than 2,300. Hampton Falls 
is a small but mighty town, dedicated to main-
taining its lands and protecting our environ-
ment. If the past three centuries are any indi-
cation on the future, Hampton Falls is sure to 
persevere and prosper for years to come. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate the Town of Hampton Falls on 
this incredible milestone. I look forward to a 
continued partnership with Hampton Falls and 
its residents who I am proud to represent in 
Congress.

RECOGNIZING 
DR. 
JOELY 
PROUDFIT AS MY CONSTITUENT 
OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great honor to recognize Carlsbad resi-
dent, educator, and fierce advocate for Indige-
nous peoples, Dr. Joely Proudfit, for my De-
cember Constituent of the Month. A Native 
Southern 
Californian 
and 
a 
Luisen˜o/ 
Payo´mkawichum woman, Dr. Proudfit first 
tapped into her passion for activism in college 
as a way for her to stay connected to her Na-
tive ancestry and support Native peoples. As 
the first member of her family to complete a 
high school diploma, and now a renowned and 
tenured professor, Dr. Proudfit has dedicated 
her life’s work to furthering the education and 
promotion of proper representation for Native 
Americans and Indigenous peoples in media 
and society. 
Dr. Proudfit strives to serve as a role model 
to Native youth by encouraging all who enter 
her classroom that anyone can achieve suc-
cess with self-determination and a desire for 
knowledge. Dr. Proudfit also uses her platform 
as an educator and highly visible advocate to 
shed light on the harmful stereotypes and 
false narratives perpetuated around American 
Indians and to change perceptions of tribal 
communities. 
What makes California’s 49th District so 
special is the rich blending of cultures, back-
grounds, and walks of life throughout our com-
munities. The voices and stories of Native 
Americans have fallen to the shadows far too 
often. I am so grateful to have leaders and 
role models like Dr. Proudfit who are the 
voices we need for these communities to be 
seen and heard. The contributions and voices 
of Native and Indigenous peoples are funda-
mental to our national story, and Dr. Proudfit’s 
work to lift up tribal communities has made 
our community and our country stronger. I’m 
proud to recognize her as my December Con-
stituent of the Month.

ROBERT DAMMINGER 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, a native 
of Paulsboro, New Jersey, Commissioner Di-
rector Damminger attended and graduated 
from Paulsboro High School. His commitment 
to public service began as he was elected to 
hold a seat on the Paulsboro Council, which 
he served in graciously for eleven years. He 
was a member of the Public works, Finance 
and the Water Sewer Committees as well as 
Chair of the Public Safety Committee for 10 
years. 
During his tenure, Commissioner Director 
Damminger has dutifully served eight terms 
over the span of eleven years on the County 
Board. Gloucester County being home to 
roughly three-hundred thousand residents, 
Commissioner Director Damminger has led his 
fellow commissioners on the mission to pro-
vide the highest level of service while also en-
hancing the quality of life in the County. 
Commissioner Director Damminger’s dedi-
cation to Gloucester County and its residents 
has resulted in efforts to permanently preserve 
more than twenty-thousand acres of farmland 
and open space. He also helped to secure 
millions in federal and state funding to improve 
the county’s roads and infrastructure. Commis-
sioner Director Damminger is a trailblazer, 
credited with making Gloucester County the 
first county in the great state of New Jersey to 
regionalize the correctional system, putting the 
county on pace to save taxpayers a quarter- 
of-a-billion dollars over the next twenty-five 
years. Although his successor will be chosen 
in the coming months, it is evident that Com-
missioner Director Damminger’s impact on 
Gloucester County will be appreciated for 
years to come.

CONGRATULATING JAN OLIVER ON 
HER MANY YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I 
want to take a moment to recognize and con-
gratulate, the Committee’s Chief Counsel, Jan 
Oliver on her upcoming retirement. Jan has 
been a stalwart for small businesses for years 
and has worked in public service for decades. 
From her time with now Senator PORTMAN to 
working at the White House to her service to 
this Committee, her steady guidance and 
counsel has always been welcomed. Jan, 
thank you for the thoughtful insight and anal-
ysis on all issues, including and especially 
those pertaining to regulations and its impact 
on small businesses.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
MRS. 
JUANITA 
CARRERE MITCHELL FOR CELE-
BRATING 110 YEARS OF LIFE 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 2022 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, life is precious, even if you live it for 
only a brief period of time. When you are 
blessed to live 110 years, one hundred and 
ten productive years, and be in relatively good 
health, good enough to talk several minutes 
with a Congressman who called your daughter 
to get some information, you are truly blessed. 
Mrs. Juanita Mitchell was born December 
15, 1911 in Nestor, Louisiana to Acklin and 
Cinderella Carrere. She remembers her grand-
mother cooking and people working in the field 
and harvesting the crops. She describes her 
grandfather as White, and remarks his family 
distanced themselves from him after he mar-
ried a black woman, her grandmother. 
Mrs. Mitchell and her family relocated to 
Chicago in 1919 following the death of her fa-
ther. Her father left home going to New Orle-
ans in preparation for war service. During his 
time in New Orleans, he took sick, was diag-
nosed with pneumonia, which became known 
as the plague. It was the loss of her father 
that prompted her mother to come to Chicago 
with her two girls. Mrs. Mitchell’s relocation to 
Chicago was unsettling, when she came to 
Chicago in 1919 as race riots erupted. Mrs. 
Mitchell has vivid memories of these experi-
ences and shares the events and how it felt 
as an 8-year-old child. She recalls hiding be-
hind the piano in her uncle’s home with her 
mother and younger sister. Juanita Mitchell 
lived through the Chicago race riots, the de-
pression and segregated neighborhoods. She 
went on to marry and raise two children. Jua-
nita Mitchell lived on 35th and Giles in Chi-
cago. Her aunt and uncle, Dr. Carl White had 
a grocery store and his medical office across 
the street from Olivet Baptist Church. 
Mrs. Mitchell attended Sunday School and 
church at Olivet Baptist Church. She attended 
Drake Elementary and Hyde Park High 
School. She then went on to business school 
and Washburn Trade where she studied Tai-
loring. Juanita and Morant Mitchell were mar-
ried May 3, 1934. They celebrated 50 years of 
marriage in 1984. Mr. Mitchell died in 1987. 
Mrs. Mitchell was always civic minded. She is 
a life-long Eastern Star and is a past worthy 
matron. 
In moving to Flossmoor at the age 85, she 
continued her community engagement, serving 
on the beautiful Action Committee for her sub-
division and attending village and association 
meetings at the age of 110 years old, and she 
continues to be a member of the ‘‘Belles of 
Ballantrae’’. 
Congratulations to Mrs. Juanita Carrere 
Mitchell, on living a long and outstanding life. 
I thank Mary for bringing her mother to our 
attention. Mary, John, and other members of 
the family have been truly blessed to have her 
with them for all of their lives. May she con-
tinue to live and enjoy life.
