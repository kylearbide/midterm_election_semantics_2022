BLACK LIVES MATTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, as I rise today, Mr. 
Speaker, to speak the truth about the 
circumstance as it relates to African 
Americans in the United States of 
America. 
I rise to say, Mr. Speaker, that Black 
lives do not matter as much as White 
lives. If Black lives matter as much as 
White lives, Mr. George Floyd would 
still be breathing. If Black lives matter 
as much as White lives, Ahmaud 
Arbery would have finished his jog. If 
Black lives matter as much as White 
lives, Christian Cooper wouldn’t have 
been falsely accused. 
Black lives do not matter as much as 
White lives. Why? Because we tolerate 
hatred, bigotry, and invidious discrimi-
nation. We tolerate it. And because we 
tolerate it, we allow it to be perpet-
uated. 
We in this country have the power to 
do something about the racism that ex-
ists as it relates to Black people. We 
have tolerated it since 1619 and the ar-
rival of Black people in the Americas. 
But it is time for us to do something 
about it. 
We have had the opportunity to do 
something. 
When the Chief Executive Officer of 
this country is a racist and a bigot, we 
should do something about that. And 
we had the opportunity to, but we did 
not. We tolerated it. And there were 
some who went so far as to almost jus-
tify it with some of their commentary 
about the comments that were being 
made: Oh, he is just a jerk. 
Black lives matter, and we ought not 
tolerate it to the extent we have. 
I believe that we in the Congress of 
the United States of America have a 
duty to do what has been done in the 
past. We declared a war on poverty. We 
declared a war on drugs. Why not de-
clare a war on racism? Why not decide 
that, here and now, we are not going to 
allow racism to continue in this coun-
try to the extent that people lose their 
lives? 
What happened to some of the per-
sons who have lost their lives as of late 
is almost predictable, because we have 
seen circumstances similar occur and 
we have not taken aggressive action. 
The officers in the Floyd case should 
not only be arrested; they ought to be 
prosecuted. I was a magistrate. I know 
probable cause when I see it, and there 
is probable cause to arrest and pros-
ecute those officers. 
Black lives matter. And those who 
have not allowed the Black Lives Mat-
ter movement to continue, to become 
the movement that could make a dif-
ference in the lives of people in this 
country, have some responsibility be-
cause they fought the very movement 
that was going to make a difference in 
the lives of people, may have saved 
some lives of people. 
So I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to say 
that we in Congress have some respon-
sibility to the people we serve; and a 
part of that responsibility is to assure 
them that they can go jogging and re-
turn home, that if they are arrested by 
the police, they won’t be suffocated to 
the extent that they lose their lives. 
We have to make sure that we tell this 
country, in no uncertain terms, that 
Black lives do matter. 
And, finally, this: It is not about 
Democrats and not about Republicans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2286 
May 27, 2020 
I am not blaming the Republicans for 
what is happening. I am not blaming 
the Democrats for what is happening. I 
am blaming people who hold public 
trust and tolerate hate and invidious 
discrimination. 
We are the people who can make a 
difference, and we ought to make a dif-
ference. We ought to demand that the 
people running for public office make 
public statements about how they plan 
to end invidious discrimination, not 
how they plan to tolerate it, how they 
plan to manage it. 
How do you plan to end it? 
How do you plan to end it in bank-
ing? 
How do you plan to end it in hiring 
and promotions? 
This is our time. If we don’t do it 
now, when will we do it? No candidate 
should be off limits. Every one of them 
ought to have to tell us what they plan 
to do. 
And, finally, as my final comments: I 
love my country. And because I love 
my country, I feel that I have this 
duty, obligation, and responsibility to 
speak up when these kinds of injustices 
occur. 
I love my country, Mr. Speaker. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
FOLLOW THE SCIENCE, FOR A 
CHANGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, just 
a few months ago, America enjoyed the 
most promising economic expansion in 
our lifetimes, lifting millions of Ameri-
cans out of poverty, boosting wages for 
American workers, and producing the 
lowest unemployment rates in 50 years. 
Today, the American economy lies in 
rubble, with tens of millions of Ameri-
cans thrown into unemployment, pov-
erty, and despair. 
Now, that damage was not done by a 
virus. It was done by ordering entire 
populations into indefinite home de-
tention, 
shuttering 
countless 
busi-
nesses, and desecrating the most funda-
mental human rights that our Con-
stitution demands our government to 
protect. 
Now, we are told to follow the 
science and data. That would be nice, 
for a change. 
What does the science tell us about 
the severity of COVID–19? Well, we 
know that about 80 percent of those 
who get it either have no symptoms at 
all or experience it as a mild res-
piratory infection. In New York, 74 per-
cent of those who died were over age 65 
and six one-hundredths of 1 percent 
were under the age of 18. Three-quar-
ters of those who died had underlying 
medical conditions. 
So how does it follow the science to 
close the schools where it poses the 
least danger while packing infected pa-
tients into nursing homes where it 
poses the greatest danger? 
Once 
epidemiologists 
began 
sur-
veying general populations, they dis-
covered the disease isn’t nearly as se-
vere as the claims that set off the glob-
al panic. Researchers at Stanford Uni-
versity surveyed the population of 
Santa Clara, California, and estimated 
a fatality rate of seventeen one-hun-
dredths of 1 percent. New York serol-
ogy tests revealed a fatality rate of 
one-half of 1 percent. 
So, simply stated, if you get the flu, 
your chance of survival is 99.9 percent; 
and according to these studies, if you 
get COVID–19, your chance of survival 
is better than 99.5 percent. 
So how does this science justify 
throwing nearly 40 million Americans 
into unemployment? 
Does the science support population- 
wide lockdowns? 
In 2006, based upon an Albuquerque 
teenager’s science paper, the Bush ad-
ministration proposed mass lockdowns 
in the event of a severe flu pandemic. 
Leading epidemiologists warned at the 
time that: ‘‘The negative consequences 
of large-scale quarantine are so ex-
treme that this mitigation measure 
should be eliminated from serious con-
sideration.’’ It wasn’t. 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 
has now admitted that 84 percent of 
COVID–19 hospitalizations in New York 
are people who are either already quar-
antined at home or are at nursing 
homes. 
Statistical analysts, including Stan-
ford University’s Michael Levitt, Tel 
Aviv 
University’s 
Isaac 
Ben-Israel, 
Kentucky State University’s Wilfred 
Reilly, and Cypress Semiconductor’s T. 
J. Rodgers, are finding no significant 
statistical difference in the infection 
curves between those jurisdictions that 
have destroyed their economies and 
those that haven’t. In fact, a study by 
J.P. Morgan has found an inverse rela-
tionship as economies began to open 
back up. 
A study of 318 outbreaks involving 
1,245 cases in China found just one out-
break that occurred outdoors, involv-
ing just two cases. Eighty percent of 
the outbreaks occurred in people’s 
homes. So how does it follow the 
science to close outdoor venues and 
order people indoors? 
Mr. Speaker, it is high time we con-
sidered how many Americans will die 
because of the COVID–19 lockdowns. 
The Well Being Trust predicts up to 
75,000 ‘‘deaths of despair’’ due to sui-
cide and drug and alcohol abuse be-
cause of the lockdown. 
In March, the Epic Health Research 
Network warned of a 94 percent decline 
in breast, colon, and cervical cancer 
screenings. The Rape, Abuse & Incest 
National Network reports a 22 percent 
increase in children calling for help. 
A 2011 Columbia University study 
funded by the National Institutes of 
Health estimated that 41⁄2 percent of all 
deaths in the United States are related 
to poverty. So how does it follow the 
science to destroy the livelihoods of 
millions of Americans, cut them off 
from their social networks, force them 
into isolation, and plunge them into 
poverty and despair? 
Now, I don’t blame public health offi-
cials. They have the luxury of ignoring 
the effect of their policies beyond their 
area of expertise. The responsibility 
rests, rather, with public officials who 
failed to consider the catastrophic col-
lateral damage that they have caused, 
who became so drunk with power and 
so 
besotted 
with 
self-righteousness 
that they lost any reference to com-
mon sense or any concern for the dam-
age they have done. 
f 
NEED FOR FIFTH CORONAVIRUS 
STIMULUS BILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I come to 
the floor to echo the rising chorus for 
a fifth coronavirus bill and to applaud 
three vital provisions addressed to the 
special circumstances of the District of 
Columbia in that bill. 
Speaker 
NANCY
PELOSI
and 
the 
Democrats have taken needed initia-
tive in introducing the HEROES Act to 
get ahead of this virus, instead of chas-
ing it. 
The first four bills have proven them-
selves. Jurisdictions following the CDC 
guidelines, like the District of Colum-
bia, are seeing deaths decrease. Across 
the country, careful reopenings are oc-
curring. To be sure, scientists are 
warning of prolonging the virus unless 
there is more social distancing and 
masking, because that is far from uni-
versal. 
But my Republican friends have 
called for a pause. Of course, we have 
seen unprecedented spending, but this 
is an unprecedented virus. The virus 
has shut down the entire world. 
I am pleased that Republicans may 
be declaring the end of their pause 
barely a week after House passage of 
the HEROES Act. Yesterday, the Sen-
ate majority leader said Congress will 
probably have to pass a fifth bill. 
Thank you, Senator MCCONNELL. 
President Trump said—and I am 
quoting him—‘‘I think the United 
States will need another round of stim-
ulus.’’ 
They may be following Federal Re-
serve Chairman Jerome Powell, who 
said more is needed for the economy 
shortly after the April report showed a 
14.7 percent unemployment rate. 
Mr. MCCONNELL only wants to fund 
increased losses due to 
COVID–19, 
whatever that means. But tailoring the 
next bill based on whether COVID–19 or 
something else caused the losses would 
require an inexact calculus that itself 
could bog down the next bill, particu-
larly what I regard as the most essen-
tial part of the HEROES Act, $1 tril-
lion for State and local government.

May 27, 2020 
This is the government, State and 
local government, that is closest to the 
people. This is the government that 
funds first responders and healthcare 
workers in local hospitals. This is the 
government that funds the workers 
who pick up your garbage twice a 
week. This is the government running 
on fumes. 
So are the American people who need 
another cash payment, an additional 
$1,200 per family member, up to $6,000 
per household, and other essentials like 
unemployment benefits and housing 
benefits, a 15 percent increase in nutri-
tion programs. People have got to eat 
during this crisis. 
b 1015 
I also have been able to get included 
in the HEROES Act a trifecta of provi-
sions that the District must have, be-
ginning with the $755 million in retro-
active funding Republicans in the Sen-
ate removed from the CARES Act by 
treating the District for the first time 
in American history as a territory, 
when we have always been treated for 
what we are, a State for funding pur-
poses, and, of course, the D.C. state-
hood bill has enough cosponsors to pass 
this very year. 
We have always received State-level 
funding because we pay the highest 
Federal taxes per capita in the United 
States. The HEROES Act also includes 
money for State, county, and city 
funding, the first time the District has 
ever had to break down its funding. 
The District is a unique jurisdiction in 
the United States because it operates 
at all three levels. 
The HEROES Act also authorizes the 
District to participate in the municipal 
liquidity facilities funding of the Fed-
eral Reserve, if that should become 
necessary. The $3 trillion HEROES Act 
sent to the Senate last week is a mark-
er. It will probably not be enough, as 
large as it is, to contain this virus. 
But, at a minimum, it should get us 
started on sensible negotiations. 
Time, Mr. Speaker, is not on the side 
of the virus. Let’s beat it with the HE-
ROES Act. 
f 
LOWERING PRESCRIPTIONS COSTS 
FOR SENIORS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to commend President 
Trump and the administration for tak-
ing decisive action to lower drug costs 
for America’s seniors. 
Currently, 34.2 million people in the 
U.S. have diabetes. One in every three 
seniors on Medicare has diabetes, and 
over 3.3 million beneficiaries use at 
least one type of insulin. 
Thanks to President Trump, the out- 
of-pocket cost for insulin has been cut. 
Participating plans will cap costs at 
just $35 a month per type of insulin. 
This is tremendous news. 
For far too long, seniors have been 
subjected to escalating insulin prices. 
Now, Americans will save an average of 
$446 on insulin costs in just a year. 
I thank President Trump for con-
tinuing to put the American people 
first. 
ADMINISTRATION AIDING NORTH CAROLINA 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, there is no substitute for 
swift and decisive action. Since the ini-
tial outbreak of COVID–19 in China, 
President Trump and the administra-
tion have worked tirelessly to protect 
the American people. 
First, President Trump closed our 
borders and enacted a travel ban to 
protect the American people. This was 
a necessary precaution that undoubt-
edly saved lives. In response, the main-
stream media’s political pundits cried 
foul and claimed this was an ill-advised 
tactic 
intended 
to 
score 
political 
points. That could not be farther from 
the truth. 
Sadly, my colleagues across the aisle 
and those in the media would rather 
search for the newest outrage du jour 
instead of focusing on the efforts of the 
President and the administration to 
combat COVID–19. 
It is time to correct the record and 
cast aside the falsehoods that Demo-
crats and the mainstream media are 
pushing against President Trump and 
the administration. 
For example, let’s look at what is 
being done to help North Carolinians 
during this pandemic. Under the direc-
tion of President Trump, FEMA has ob-
ligated almost $30 million for COVID–19 
response efforts in North Carolina. 
From the Strategic National Stock-
pile, North Carolina received to date: 
Over 250,000 N95 masks; over 580,000 sur-
gical 
masks; 
over 
100,000 
medical 
gowns; over 115,000 face shields; and 
over 425,000 pairs of gloves. 
In addition, President Trump ap-
proved Governor Roy Cooper’s Major 
Disaster Declaration, and then directed 
FEMA to fund 100 percent of the emer-
gency assistance activities provided by 
the North Carolina National Guard. 
President Trump and the administra-
tion are deeply committed to pro-
tecting not only North Carolinians, but 
also Americans across our country. 
If my colleagues across the aisle 
shared the same sentiment of being ‘‘in 
it together,’’ they would work with us 
to deliver for the American people and 
set aside their relentless impeachment 
crusade. 
It is time to get our country back on 
its feet, and I am proud that President 
Trump and the administration are 
working day in and day out to do so. 
We will win this fight, and I am certain 
we will emerge stronger and more resil-
ient. 
f 
THE NAVAJO NATION AND THE 
CORONAVIRUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to share with my colleagues 
in Washington—and all watching at 
home—the dire situation COVID–19 has 
created in the Navajo Nation and 
across our Nation. 
But first, standing in this Chamber 
today, I want to recognize the nearly 
100,000 lives lost thus far to the 
coronavirus, a staggering number that 
has affected families, communities, 
economy, frontline first responders, 
and many others. 
Though some Americans may feel 
they have reached a new normal, hot 
spots across our Nation are still in the 
thick of this pandemic, and the fear for 
what might come in the fall and winter 
is at the forefront of our thoughts. 
One of those hot spots is the Navajo 
Nation. Per capita, the Navajo Nation 
has more confirmed coronavirus cases 
than any U.S. State. Under the CARES 
Act, signed into law March 27, my col-
leagues and I fought to include $8 bil-
lion for Tribal governments to use for 
expenses incurred during the pandemic. 
The first round of that funding did 
not reach the Navajo Nation until May 
5. Much of the delay was because offi-
cials within the Department of the In-
terior were considering allocating a 
portion of this $8 billion to the Alaska 
Natives Corporation, a group of for- 
profit entities that generate billions of 
dollars in revenue each year, and an-
swer to individual stakeholders. 
I immediately joined the voices of 
Tribes across our Nation in demanding 
that these funds reach established 
Tribal governments, not corporations. 
On April 27, a U.S. district judge an-
nounced that the Treasury Department 
could begin distributing money to fed-
erally-recognized Tribes, and not to 
this corporate group. Delayed funding 
is not the only issue here. While Tribes 
wait for the rest of the CARES Act 
money they were promised, politics in 
Washington continue to complicate al-
ready acute public health concerns on 
Navajo. 
Recent reports indicate that res-
pirator masks sent to Navajo Nation 
hospitals through a Federal contract 
with a former White House staffer may 
be faulty. I have serious concerns 
about the lack of oversight and ac-
countability in this contract-awarding 
process, considering that this $3 mil-
lion deal was awarded to a friend of the 
administration with no prior Federal 
contracting experience, who had only 
been in business for 11 days. 
It is unacceptable for government to 
be delivering anything other than what 
is needed to any community, much less 
a hard-hit community like Navajo. 
I have asked my colleagues here to 
help me launch an immediate inves-
tigation into the potentially faulty 
PPE, and to make sure that the entire 
contracting 
process 
receives 
more 
oversight. 
While Tribes deal with the fallout 
politics has caused, they endure other

factors that have complicated this pan-
demic as well. Critical water, sanita-
tion, and broadband projects through-
out the Navajo Nation remain un-
funded and firmly on Congress’ back 
burner. 
Since coming to Washington in 2017, 
I have tried to raise the alarm about 
these long-overlooked issues. I have 
worked 
with 
Tribal 
governments, 
shareholders in my district, and my 
colleagues here on Capitol Hill to find 
solutions to the problems faced by In-
dian Country. 
This public health crisis continues to 
shine a brighter light on the hurdles 
that many Tribal families face every 
day, not just during a global pandemic. 
I hope I can count on the many who 
have joined me in speaking up for Trib-
al communities to continue to do so 
after this crisis because lives are at 
stake here. 
Tribal communities are tired of par-
tisan games and political spin. They 
need the resources they were promised 
so each sovereign Nation can care for 
their people. 
The Dine people are resilient and 
they will win this fight. 
In a report yesterday from my friend 
and Navajo Nation President Jonathan 
Nez, he noted that the Navajo Nation’s 
own aggressive public health measures 
have 
helped 
flatten 
the 
curve 
of 
COVID–19 significantly. 
The situation could have been much 
worse without his leadership, and the 
region remains at a high risk if the 
Federal Government does not step up 
and do its part.

ECONOMIC AND INTELLECTUAL 
COMPETITION WITH CHINA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognize the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, for far too long, the Chinese 
Communist Party has taken advantage 
of innocent people in its own country 
and around the world. 
Now, America is engaged in an eco-
nomic and intellectual competition 
with China that existed long before the 
coronavirus crossed our borders. The 
current pandemic merely has exposed 
the Chinese Communist Party’s sin-
ister lies, and the depths to which it 
will reach. 
There is no question that we must 
hold this regime accountable for all of 
its actions. As a member of the China 
Task Force, I am committed to com-
bating 
the 
Chinese 
Government’s 
threats to our great Nation. We must 
be focused on strengthening and pro-
tecting our supply chains to ensure 
that we are never beholden to this re-
gime for critical medicines and critical 
supplies. 
Americans must once again lead in 
innovation. We must, and we will. 
SURVEILLANCE OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, October 
2001, under the shadow of 9/11, with the 
House office buildings evacuated be-
cause of the threat of anthrax, a bill 
authored by Chairman JIM
SENSEN-
BRENNER and the Bush White House 
was brought before the House. It was 
called the USA PATRIOT Act. 
Now, who could, in the shadow of 9/11, 
vote against anything called the USA 
PATRIOT Act? Well, I did, as did 66 
other 
Members; 
3 
Republicans, 
62 
Democrats, and 1 Independent, because 
of the unbelievably, unconstitutionally 
broad powers that would be granted for 
surveillance of all the American people 
in myriad ways. 
Now, there wasn’t even a copy of the 
bill available. I came to the floor, and 
I said: Can I have a copy of the bill? 
They said: Sorry, there is only one. It 
is on the Republican side. I said: Well, 
it is not the Senate. I can’t filibuster, 
but I will make it a long day with the 
adjournment votes. Get me a copy. 
They printed out a copy, it was hot off 
the Xerox. I got rushed on this side by 
Members of the Judiciary Committee 
who ostensibly authored the bill to try 
and find out what the heck was in it, 
but people still voted for it. The abuses 
that have come under this are myriad 
and well-documented. 
Now, I credit ZOE LOFGREN for trying 
to amend the most egregious section, 
215, and my colleague, RON WYDEN from 
Oregon. Senator WYDEN
almost suc-
ceeded in the Senate, short one vote. 
And ZOE tried on the last reauthoriza-
tion and this one to amend that. Unfor-
tunately, she was pressured by and 
forced to, since otherwise they would 
block her amendment, to water down 
her revisions to section 215. 
Now, Senator WYDEN is opposed, as 
are others. What is section 215? Unbe-
lievably broad, warrantless, intrusive, 
internet searches of everything you 
look at, browse online. For what pur-
pose? Who knows? What are they going 
to do with that information? Well, 
maybe they are going to apply an algo-
rithm and find something. They gather 
so much data, they don’t know what to 
do with it. 
b 1030 
What is the legal standard? A pre-
sumption of relevance to an investiga-
tion. Isn’t that a laughable standard? 
You could presume relevance to vir-
tually anything in the world at any 
time. 
So this bill, even if that amendment 
should pass, even if the bill comes up 
today—it is questionable whether it 
will. We now have government by 
tweet on that side of the aisle. 
Trump says jump; they jump. And 
last night, Trump said he is against 
this, even though it has a special provi-
sion in the bill for President Trump be-
cause of the Carter Page abuses. 
It says the ‘‘Attorney General,’’ in 
quotes—by the way, that means any 
senior official in the Justice Depart-
ment—would have to sign off on tar-
geting Federal officials or candidates 
for office. 
First off, why should those people be 
exempt if they are engaged in terrorist 
activities or presumptive relevance of 
terrorist activities? 
But, again, ‘‘Attorney General,’’ with 
this laughable clown in the Attorney 
General’s Office who jumps even higher 
than they do when the President 
tweets, I don’t think so. Just think of 
how they could use that politically, 
not for intelligence purposes. 
It does nothing to reform section 702, 
which is incidental backdoor accumu-
lation of data. There are many, many 
documented abuses of section 202. 
It does finally do away with what was 
revealed by Mr. Snowden, the massive 
gathering of all phone records. 
Again, what are they going to do 
with 
it? 
Hundreds 
of 
millions 
of 
records, no effective algorithms, no 
way to figure out what it was about. It 
was useless, operationally, as analyzed 
by numerous commissions and others, 
but there was still massive compliance 
and errors. 
Even the NSA said: No, we don’t 
want that anymore; we can’t do any-
thing with it. But the administration 
asked that it be continued. This bill 
doesn’t continue it, one of the few mer-
its of this so-called reform bill. 
This bill does not deserve passage. It 
does not undo the damage that was cre-
ated in the shadow of 9/11, to the igno-
rance of most Members of Congress 
who voted for it.

PROTECT FARMERS’ WATER AND 
PROPERTY RIGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, in that 
we do have other things going on in 
this country besides the virus, we do 
have a crisis up in the Klamath Basin 
on the border of California and Oregon 
right now. 
The Klamath farmers up there are 
the owners of the Klamath Project 
water. It was created approximately 
100 years ago to allow the ability to 
farm crops to returning World War I 
and World War II veterans at that 
point. Those growers owned the right 
to approximately 350,000 acre-feet from 
the Upper Klamath Lake, water cre-
ated by the project which would not 
exist without the creation of the 
project. 
This year, after many years of having 
their water pirated away from them, 
their allocation during a lesser water 
rainfall and snowfall season was 140,000 
acre-feet, they were told on April 1, the 
second-worst allocation they have ever 
had, rivaled only by 2001 when they got 
zero acre-feet allocated to them. 140,000 
acre-feet, they were told.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2289 
May 27, 2020 
So as farmers do—I am a farmer; I 
get it—we go out and start the process 
of planting; tilling the ground; order-
ing up your fertilizer and your seed; ap-
plying the fertilizer; and then, finally, 
seeding the ground. 
Well, lo and behold, a few weeks 
later, it was decided to release 50,000 
acre-feet from that lake in order to 
help suppress a virus farther down the 
Klamath River called the C. shasta, 
which is supposed to be harmful to the 
coho salmon, a fish that is deemed en-
dangered on the Klamath, yet not en-
dangered in other areas of the country. 
Right on the heels of the end of that 
50,000 acre-foot release for C. shasta 
virus for coho salmon, it was decided 
that there is now not enough water in 
the lake. The incoming water supply 
was misestimated. 
They were told they were going to 
have to cut back from the original 
140,000 acre-feet. They were going to 
cut back approximately 60,000 acre-feet 
of that, leaving them with about 80,000 
acre-feet for the entire season. This is 
crops already spent, the cost already 
incurred to be put in the ground. 
The water supply is estimated to last 
until approximately June 15. From 
June 16 to September, they are going 
to be in a very dire way. They are 
going to be out of water, with the in-
vestment in the ground. 
As devastating as 2001 was, this will 
break many farms up in the Klamath 
Basin. Unique crops they grow up 
there—mint, radishes, potatoes, many 
others—as well as the refuge that sits 
at the far end of that system that 
needs the water to flow through those 
irrigation districts so we will have a 
duck population, so we will have other 
wildlife that is extremely important 
not only for the area but for the entire 
State of California and the West Coast. 
This duck population is going to be 
devastated. Just recently, when they 
had good water, they had a huge num-
ber of ducks hatch, and we had a good 
population. That is going to be dev-
astated. 
Farming is the only major economic 
industry, really, in the region, other 
than some tourism. There are about 
12,000 farms in that Klamath Basin. Ap-
proximately $75 million has been spent 
putting those crops in. It is thought, as 
it is being estimated right now, the 
total effect on the region, if this water 
is taken away and not restored by 
somewhere around June 15, $200 to $300 
million more is coming out of that 
area. We have created a crisis up there. 
This water, by law, belongs to the 
irrigators, not to the Endangered Spe-
cies Act, not to a Federal agency. The 
irrigators themselves spend $30 million 
a year to maintain and operate, if it is 
actually operating, the project. They 
still have to pay that bill. 
But the Endangered Species Act is 
being interpreted to require water that 
doesn’t belong to the government to be 
taken and given either to keep the lake 
fuller for the sucker fish or run down-
stream in order to allegedly help the 
coho salmon. There are science and ar-
guments out there that this doesn’t 
help those two species, yet we continue 
down this blind path, doing it year 
after year after year, for least 20 years. 
At this point, with the uncertainty of 
our Nation’s food supply, from the 
farm gate to the markets, this is what 
we have going on with farmers up 
there, having their property rights 
taken. We must do better. We must 
take immediate action. 
f 
GIVE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERN-
MENTS 
FUNDS 
TO 
CONDUCT 
TESTING, CONTACT TRACING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, for 
the last 3 months, tens of millions of 
our fellow Americans have chosen to 
make painful sacrifices to keep one an-
other safe. 
They made that choice before any 
Governor of any State told them they 
had to. They did what they thought 
was right, what was decent, what was 
responsible. 
Overwhelmingly, 
the 
American people still believe that so-
cial distancing to protect our neigh-
bors is the right thing to do even where 
States have lifted stay-at-home orders. 
You wouldn’t know this by watching 
the news because the news dwells on 
conflict, not consensus. The loudest 
voices say: ‘‘Reopen everything now. 
Yes, people will die, but people die of 
car crashes, of cancer, of heart disease. 
We don’t stay home for that.’’ The 
angriest voices say: ‘‘Go to the grocery 
store. Throw off your mask. Make 
them call the police.’’ They pretend to 
be brave. They shout childish slogans 
about liberty, as if liberty meant the 
right to endanger the lives of others for 
our own convenience. 
On social media, there is an effort to 
make everything about this pandemic 
partisan; as if whether you are a Demo-
crat or Republican should determine 
what medicines you should take or 
whether you should wear a mask. 
I have been to plenty of countries 
where everything is made to be polit-
ical, where everything is made to be 
tribal. I never thought I would see peo-
ple in the United States of America 
trying to make our country like that. 
But, Mr. Speaker, America is not like 
that. The vast majority of Republicans 
and Democrats still say that of course 
we should do what is needed to protect 
others. We are still a country that 
cares whether people live or die more 
than we care about the stock market. 
In New Jersey this year, we have had 
177 road fatalities. Thus far, we have 
lost more than 11,000 people to the 
coronavirus, and that number would be 
vastly higher if not for the lockdowns. 
Now, nobody is rushing to our State 
capital with guns, screaming to keep 
the economy closed. No one ever loudly 
clamors for shared sacrifice. But the 
quiet majority still say that we should 
put public health first. The vast major-
ity still want to be sure that we have 
to do this only once, and therefore, we 
have to do it right. 
So, yes, I get a lot of questions back 
home about when things are going to 
reopen. But the most urgent question I 
get is not when do we reopen, but: How 
are you going to help us safely reopen? 
What are you doing about that? 
Right now, the only responsible an-
swer is that we must vastly expand 
contact tracing and testing for the 
coronavirus so that people can go back 
to normal life, knowing it is safe. 
Unfortunately, the administration’s 
plan for testing, which we just re-
ceived, basically states to the States 
around our country: We will give you 
some supplies, but otherwise, you are 
on your own. 
It is a shameful abdication of respon-
sibility. At this point, I am done with 
expecting better from our President. 
We are on our own in New Jersey, in 
Michigan, in Ohio, in California. 
So, let’s at least give our State and 
local governments the resources they 
need to bear this burden that our na-
tional government will not. 
The HEROES Act would provide $75 
billion to help our States conduct the 
testing and contact tracing that we 
need if we want to go back to work and 
school safely. The HEROES Act also 
provides the funding our State and 
local governments have been pleading 
for to make up for revenues lost be-
cause of coronavirus. 
Mr. Speaker, in my district, I rep-
resent 75 small towns. We have more 
Republican mayors in those towns than 
Democrats, but this is not partisan in 
my district. Every one of them would 
rather spend money to pay our cops, 
our firefighters, and our teachers to do 
their jobs than spend money to pay for 
their unemployment. 
My message to those who are step-
ping down from responsibility is at 
least help us to help those who are 
stepping up. You want to go to the 
beach, to a ball game? You want to 
hold political rallies? Fine, so do I. 
Help the people who are risking their 
lives to make it safer for us to do those 
things. Help the people who are work-
ing, who never stopped working, to 
give us liberty without giving us death. 
That is what the HEROES Act does. 
If the Senate has a better plan, then 
let’s hear it; let’s negotiate; let’s find 
our common ground. Otherwise, let’s 
send it to the President and get this 
job done.

HIGHLIGHTING THE LAND AND 
WATER CONSERVATION FUND 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I rise to bring attention to the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund, 
otherwise known as the LWCF. 
Families across the Lowcountry are 
turning to green spaces to cope during

this pandemic, and it is clear that we 
need more parks and trails where folks 
can get outside with social distancing. 
That is what LWCF does for commu-
nities. 
Our region relies on tourism and out-
door recreation, sectors that are tak-
ing a major hit these days. That is why 
I am standing with the businesses that 
make 
up 
the 
Outdoor 
Recreation 
Roundtable in calling on Congress to 
pass the bipartisan Great American 
Outdoors Act to fully fund LWCF and 
restore our parks. 
Whether it is our seafood, our beach-
es, the opportunities to hunt and fish, 
access to nature is one reason the 
Lowcountry is so special. Let’s keep it 
that way by investing in conservation 
that supports our health and our econ-
omy. 
f 
b 1045 
COVID–19 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we 
are in the backdrop of commemorating 
Memorial Day just 2 days ago, when 
the Nation bowed their heads to honor 
the fallen. We did that without ques-
tion, without equivocation. But we also 
acknowledge, and I stand here today 
acknowledging, the sacrifice of those 
heroes, acknowledging that 1,000 vet-
erans, as well, have lost their lives 
from COVID–19. 
I stand here today to say to America, 
almost 100,000 of our fellow Americans, 
our fellow residents, our mothers and 
fathers, sisters and brothers, cousins, 
aunts, 
uncles, 
grandparents, 
loved 
ones, and neighbors, dear friends, class-
mates, and all around us have been the 
victims of COVID–19. 
So I speak for the overwhelming 
number of Americans who say yes to 
the HEROES Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask those in the other 
body and in the administration: Have 
you ever seen a headline that said, 
when a city tried to do its best, $15 mil-
lion in rental assistance runs out in 90 
minutes—in my hometown of Houston. 
Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to the 
mayor, thank you to the county judge. 
They are trying. 
Have you ever seen someone who’s 
never had to beg for food or ask for 
food sit in the hot Sun in their car for 
7 hours—I have—to be able to get gro-
ceries for their children? 
Have you ever seen folks line up to be 
tested, because they should have been 
tested in February, March, but there 
were no kits? 
So working in a public-private part-
nership with UMMC, I opened seven 
testing sites. The first one opened be-
fore any governmental site was opened. 
So I say today, that is why I am on 
the floor supporting $75 billion in test-
ing, $1 trillion in making sure that 
brave municipal workers, firefighters, 
teachers, and all those who do our 
work every day, police and others, are 
standing and supporting the commu-
nity. 
That is why I am supporting the di-
rect payment, because Chairman Pow-
ell of the Fed said we have to go big. 
There are going to ultimately maybe 
be 36 million people unemployed. That 
is why I am supporting rental assist-
ance and mortgage assistance. That is 
why I am supporting food assistance. 
Mr. Speaker, has anybody seen the 
faces of these people? Do we not under-
stand the pain of what they are going 
through? 
That is why I am here on the floor 
dealing with the support of the HE-
ROES Act that must be signed by the 
President and passed by the other 
body, the U.S. Senate. 
WE MUST DEMAND JUSTICE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to pause for a moment and now 
come to something that has soaked my 
very DNA and my soul, and that is that 
a young man by the name of Ahmaud 
Arbery cannot jog in Georgia and be 
left to his constitutional rights. They 
were denied. He was gunned down for 
absolutely no reason whatsoever. 
It must be addressed. There must be 
a trial, and there must be justice. Jus-
tice will render not his life back to his 
family, but it will render truth. 
As a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I have written letters, and I 
look forward to us organizing a re-
sponse that I have asked for in terms of 
hearing from the victims and their var-
ious representatives. 
Brianna Taylor was going to be a 
nurse; Mr. Arbery was going to be an 
electrician. She was going to be a 
nurse. She was doing what Americans 
do—sleeping, getting ready for work 
the next day—and lo and behold, she 
was bombarded; she was invaded. And 
she was the wrong house and the wrong 
person, and that person was in custody 
already. 
We must demand justice. 
When you have the color of law and 
when you have those whom you look to 
for sanctity and you can respect them 
when they are doing their work, you 
must also—and I ask my fellow law-
makers and, also, law upholders—stand 
together. 
Now, brother George Floyd, I was up 
until 2 in the morning with the pain of 
the video. George Floyd, his family—he 
was raised in Houston in my district— 
went to Jack Yates High School. There 
are 
people 
mourning 
in 
Houston, 
Texas. He lived there for 40 years, a 
gentle giant, and he was taken away 
from us by a knee on his neck, crying 
for his mama. 
There must be charges. They must be 
brought to justice, even if they wear a 
uniform, in order for law and order to 
be upheld. Everyone is watching that. 
I have had fellow officers send me 
messages: Outrageous. 
My heart is burning; my heart is 
hurting. I am crying when I heard him 
say, ‘‘Mama, Mama, Mama,’’ and his 
brothers and sisters have the pain of 
hearing that over and over again. 
People were asking, Good Samari-
tans, saying: Please take your knee off 
his neck, his trach. You are choking 
him. You are killing him. 
How can this be? 
I quietly say, Mr. Speaker, as I close, 
God is on our side. We are a nation of 
laws and the Constitution. All I ask for 
these families, all I ask, is fairness, 
simple justice, and mercy for these 
families. 
May they rest in peace, those who 
have gone on, and others, at the hands 
of those who should not have brought 
them down. 
God bless you.

neighbors with the respect of appro-
priate distance and attention to the

VOTE ON HEROES ACT IN THE 
SENATE 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, al-
most 100,000 Americans have died from 
COVID–19. Nearly 40 million unemploy-
ment claims have been filed. Our econ-
omy is in shambles. 
Two weeks ago, the House took ac-
tion. We passed the HEROES Act, $3 
trillion in new relief funds, to protect 
the lives and livelihoods of the Amer-
ican people. Two weeks later, the Sen-
ate is on vacation. They were in ses-
sion last week, but all they did was 
move forward on approving right-wing 
judges. 
This is outrageous. The Senate is sit-
ting on a bill that provides $1 trillion 
to pay first responders, healthcare 
workers, teachers who are in danger of 
losing their jobs; $200 billion for hazard 
pay; $75 billion for testing, contact 
tracing, and isolation; and cash for 
families, up to $6,000 per household. 
The American people deserve better. 
They deserve a Senate that is com-
mitted to protecting their health and 
safety. They deserve an up or down 
vote on the HEROES Act in the Sen-
ate, not next week, not the week after, 
but right now. The virus isn’t taking a 
break, 
the 
United 
States 
Senate 
shouldn’t take a break either. 
f 
RUDI SCHEIDT’S INCREDIBLE LEG-
ACY WILL NEVER BE FORGOT-
TEN 
(Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
incredible 95 years of life of Rudi 
Scheidt. Although born in Germany 
and raised in San Francisco, Rudi 
spent most of his life in Memphis. 
Through Rudi and his wife, Honey’s, 
active philanthropy and dedication to 
the arts, he touched almost every as-
pect of cultural life in the Memphis 
community. 
Rudi and Honey helped expand the 
University of Memphis Music School, 
now known as the Rudi E. Scheidt 
School of Music. They aided the Mem-
phis Wonders Series to both evolve and 
prosper. 
Rudi was committed to the Jewish 
community, serving as President of 
Temple Israel. He remained a true 
leader for his synagogue. 
Tony Bennett’s lyrics were wrong on 
this 
occasion, 
for, 
you 
see, 
Rudi 
Scheidt didn’t leave his heart in San 
Francisco. Rudi left his heart in Mem-
phis. 
I feel lucky to be able to call Rudi a 
friend. I know the city of Memphis and 
the Jewish community will feel his im-
pact for years to come. Roberta and I 
will miss him. 
My thoughts are with his wife, 
Honey, as well as their children: Susan; 
Helen; Rudi, Jr.; and Elkan during this 
difficult time. 
f 
UTAH BUSINESS OWNERS 
AFFECTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS 
(Mr. MCADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
am in Washington to continue to fight 
for Utah’s business owners and our 
working 
families 
affected 
by 
the 
coronavirus. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
was designed to help small businesses 
stay afloat and to keep employees on 
the payroll. 
Utah 
financial 
lenders 
processed 
more than $5.2 billion in loans to help 
our businesses, but we must make sure 
the program works for these busi-
nesses, and especially for their employ-
ees. 
Some Utah small businesses affected 
by the COVID–19 shutdown, through no 
fault of their own, may not be open or 
fully functional within 8 weeks. That is 
the original deadline to spend the funds 
for loan forgiveness. 
The bipartisan bill I support today 
extends the loan forgiveness period to 
include costs incurred over 24 weeks 
and provides additional flexibility to 
ensure PPP is the lifeline it was meant 
to be. 
Utah small businesses are trying do 
the right thing by their employees, 
their customers, and local commu-
nities. This legislation supports them 
in that effort and improves the likeli-
hood of a stronger economic recovery.

THANK YOU TO SC HEALTH 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to SC 
Health 
and 
their 
President, 
Alex 
Szkaradek, and their general counsel, 
John Pincelli, for their generous dona-
tion of 10,000 protective masks to de-
feat the Wuhan virus. I had the oppor-
tunity to distribute them at the West 
Columbia 
City 
Hall, 
welcomed 
by 
Mayor Tem Miles and Columbia Mayor 
Steve Benjamin. We were also joined

FUNDING FRONTLINE WORKERS 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
it is a horrible time our Nation is going 
through right now. One hundred thou-
sand souls perished in this worldwide 
pandemic. 
And through it all, every day, front-
line workers are going to work; front-
line workers like truck drivers, gar-
bage collectors, nurses, and EMTs, and 
everybody getting our groceries to us, 
slugging it out, doing their job day in 
and day out. And through it all they 
are not getting anything extra but 
their regular pay. 
That 
is 
why 
I 
introduced 
the 
Coronavirus Frontline Workers Fair 
Pay Act, and I was thrilled to see that 
get incorporated in the HEROES Act. 
I call upon MITCH MCCONNELL and the 
Senate, get off the schneid and get to 
work and pass this. The American 
economy needs this relief, and we need 
you to stop delaying and pass this eco-
nomic stimulus in the HEROES Act.

RECOGNIZING TYSON PLANT 
EMPLOYEES 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, our Nation’s frontline work-
ers must be commended for their tire-
less work during this pandemic. 
I am reminded of the 2,200 employees 
in my district who work at the Tyson 
Food plant in Wilkesboro. These men 
and women come to work every day to 
help put food on kitchen tables across 
the country. 
This week, a Wilkesboro salon re-
stricted access to Tyson employees out 
of caution for COVID–19. While the 
salon owner’s intentions may be good, 
there are safety measures that can be 
enacted to protect all patrons and em-
ployees. 
It is critical that we understand the 
challenges that these frontline workers 
are facing, and we must do everything 
we can to support them. 
Exclusionary actions are not the so-
lution. We are in this fight together, 
and we must take care of one another.

May 27, 2020 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
PHYSICIAN 
SHORTAGE 
IN 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address the physician short-
age in the United States, and our need 
to act swiftly for the future. 
If this pandemic has taught us one 
thing, that is the need to have an ade-
quate number of physicians throughout 
our country. The current health crisis 
has emphasized the importance of 
making those kinds of investments in 
our healthcare system. 
Earlier this month, the House passed 
the HEROES Act. I incorporated legis-
lation that I had introduced that would 
expand medical education in under-
served areas, like the San Joaquin Val-
ley, that I represent. This legislation is 
critical to addressing the doctor short-
ages today and tomorrow in our coun-
try. 
In January, I introduced the Expand-
ing Medical Education Act. That is 
what we need to do. 
I am pleased that my colleagues in 
the House supported this effort and in-
cluded it in the HEROES Act. These 
are our heroes. 
As 
negotiations 
for 
the 
next 
coronavirus relief bill continue, I urge 
my colleagues in the Senate to act, to 
recognize the importance of this issue. 
Do not delay. The need to enhance our 
healthcare capacity has never ever 
been more apparent. 
As a result of COVID–19, we need doc-
tors today, we need doctors tomorrow, 
and we need a part of our entire 
healthcare system to rebuild it, to in-
vest in it. Those are the kind of invest-
ments we need to make. 
I will continue to fight for every dol-
lar to ensure that our Valley residents 
have access to the healthcare they de-
serve. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF 
RICK BECK 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the career of 
Rick Beck, a teacher who has shaped 
the future of foreign language learning 
in the Yakima Valley. 
Drawing from German culture and 
his own high school experience, Rick 
developed a nationally-recognized Ger-
man language program in the West 
Valley School District. 
Through years of hard work and cur-
riculum development, Mr. Beck created 
bonds with his students, teaching them 
about language, leading exchange trips 
to help them better understand Ger-
man culture, and inspiring several to 
pursue higher education in German lin-
guistics and international relations. 
In November 2019, West Valley High 
School and German teacher Rick Beck 
were recognized by the American Asso-
ciation of Teachers of German as a 
German Center of Excellence, a crown-
ing achievement of Rick’s career. 
Now, as Rick enters into retirement, 
his legacy and the language program 
he developed will continue to inspire 
students at West Valley High School 
and beyond. 
I thank Rick for his service and com-
mitment to students across the globe. I 
wish him the best in his retirement. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ROBERT GALLAGHER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the life and leg-
acy of a good friend and great leader 
from south Sutter County, Robert Gal-
lagher. 
Born and raised in Rio Oso, Cali-
fornia, Bob spent his life dedicated to 
family, farming, and service to his 
country. 
After serving in the Army Air Corps 
during World War II, Bob returned 
home to the family farm, which has 
been owned and operated by the Galla-
gher family for the last seven genera-
tions. There, he and his wife of 53 
years, Marian, raised their seven chil-
dren. Indeed, they have a very large, 
proud Irish family. 
When he was not with his family, Bob 
served as a Sutter County supervisor, 
and was chairman of the board. And 
this is a legacy that has been passed 
down to his grandson, James, who also 
served as a Sutter County supervisor, 
and indeed has gone on to serve in the 
California legislature. 
Now, Bob was always a fun guy, and 
a guy I enjoyed meeting up with every 
time I had a chance to be in Sutter 
County. He would be known for a quip 
like—really helpful to politicians— 
‘‘Don’t put your mouth in gear before 
you put your brain in gear,’’ which is 
something that can be very helpful in a 
lot of venues. 
He had a passion for family, for base-
ball, and treating people well. That is 
his legacy. We will miss him. What a 
dear man and a dear friend. God bless 
him and his family. 
f 
SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE 
(Mr. STEWART asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I re-
cently had an experience with a group 
of, maybe, 50 people, and I asked them: 
How many of you have been impacted 
by suicide or an attempted suicide, 
someone in your family, someone that 
you love and care about? Nearly every 
hand went up. 
We are experiencing a crisis among 
our youth, a crisis among our veterans, 
and now with COVID–19, a crisis among 
the general population as we go into 
our social isolation. It is worse now 
than it was, and it has been a crisis for 
a long time. 
There is a tool that will help. The 
Suicide Prevention Hotline number 
that creates a national hotline number, 
988. No matter where you are in the 
country, if you are in the middle of a 
mental health crisis you can get help. 
We have been working on this for 3 
years. It is bipartisan, it is bicameral, 
it will save thousands of lives, espe-
cially now in the midst of this other 
crisis that is creating so much emo-
tional stress on so many Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I am asking the 
leadership, bring it up, finish it, give us 
unanimous consent today. Let’s make 
this tool available to help Americans 
who need the help, please.

REMEMBERING ARNOLD AND 
LORLEE TENENBAUM 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives 
of Mr. Arnold Tenenbaum, who passed 
away on March 24, and his loving wife, 
Mrs. Lorlee Tenenbaum, who passed 
away just 5 days later on March 29. 
Mr. and Mrs. Tenenbaum were pillars 
in the Savannah community and com-
mitted their lives to serving others 
through their work with United Way, 
the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, 
food banks, and more. 
Mr. Tenenbaum was a renowned busi-
nessman, 
philanthropist, 
and 
civic 
leader, and Lorlee joined alongside him 
in giving back to their community 
through serving on numerous boards 
and spearheading projects to promote 
Savannah’s bright future. 
Arnold was influential in both his 
business ventures, leading Chatham 
Steel Corporation, and his pursuits to 
better the lives of youth in his commu-
nity through his efforts to improve 
public education in Savannah. 
Devoting their lives to helping others 
and always bringing positivity to every 
room they entered, they greatly im-
pacted the culture of Savannah. 
The Tenenbaums loved others deeply 
and were loved by many, including 
their four amazing children. 
I am proud and thankful to have had 
such an honorable couple dedicate 
their lives to serving their community 
in the First Congressional District of 
Georgia, and I am grateful for the last-
ing impact they made on Savannah. 
My heart goes out to their family 
and friends and the entire Savannah 
community during this most difficult 
time.

UYGHUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY 
ACT OF 2020 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 3744) to condemn gross human 
rights violations of ethnic Turkic Mus-
lims in Xinjiang, and calling for an end 
to arbitrary detention, torture, and 
harassment of these communities in-
side and outside China. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3744 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the ‘‘Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 
2020’’. 
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows: 
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Statement of purpose. 
Sec. 3. Findings. 
Sec. 4. Sense of Congress. 
Sec. 5. Updating 
statement 
of 
United 
States policy toward the People’s Re-
public of China. 
Sec. 6. Imposition of sanctions. 
Sec. 7. Report on human rights abuses in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. 
Sec. 8. Report on protecting citizens and 
residents of the United States from in-
timidation and coercion. 
Sec. 9. Report on security and economic 
implications of repression in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China. 
Sec. 10. Classified report. 
SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Act is to direct United 
States resources to address human rights 
violations and abuses, including gross viola-
tions of human rights, by the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China through the 
mass surveillance and internment of over 
1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority 
groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China has a long history of repressing 
Turkic Muslims and other Muslim minority 
groups, particularly Uyghurs, in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region. In recent dec-
ades, central and regional Chinese govern-
ment policies have systematically discrimi-
nated against these minority groups by de-
nying them a range of civil and political 
rights, including the freedom of expression, 
religion, and movement, and the right to a 
fair trial. 
(2) In May 2014, the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China launched its lat-
est ‘‘Strike Hard Against Violent Extre-
mism’’ campaign, using wide-scale, inter-
nationally-linked threats of terrorism as a 
pretext to justify pervasive restrictions on 
and serious human rights violations of mem-
bers of ethnic minority communities in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The 
August 2016 appointment of former Tibet Au-
tonomous Region Party Secretary Chen 
Quanguo to be Party Secretary of Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region accelerated the 
crackdown 
across 
the 
region. 
Scholars, 
human rights organizations, journalists, and 
think tanks have provided ample evidence 
substantiating the establishment by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China of internment camps. Since 2014, the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China has detained more than 1,000,000 
Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and mem-
bers of other Muslim minority groups in 
these camps. The total ethnic minority pop-
ulation of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion was approximately 13,000,000 at the time 
of the last census conducted by the People’s 
Republic of China in 2010. 
(3) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China’s actions against Uyghurs, eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other 
Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region violate international 
human rights laws and norms, including— 
(A) the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimi-
nation, to which the People’s Republic of 
China has acceded; 
(B) the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treat-
ment or Punishment, which the People’s Re-
public of China has signed and ratified; 
(C) the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, which the People’s Re-
public of China has signed; and 
(D) the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. 
(4) Senior Chinese Communist Party offi-
cials, including current Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region Party Secretary Chen 
Quanguo, who executes Chinese government 
policy in the region, and former Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region Deputy Party 
Secretary Zhu Hailun, who crafted many of 
the policies implemented in the region, bear 
direct responsibility for gross human rights 
violations committed against Uyghurs, eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other 
Muslim minority groups. These abuses in-
clude the arbitrary detention of more than 
1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority 
groups, separation of working age adults 
from children and the elderly, and the inte-
gration of forced labor into supply chains. 
(5) Those detained in internment camps in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have 
described forced political indoctrination, 
torture, beatings, food deprivation, and de-
nial of religious, cultural, and linguistic 
freedoms. These victims have confirmed that 
they were told by guards that the only way 
to secure their release was to demonstrate 
sufficient political loyalty. Poor conditions 
and lack of medical treatment at such facili-
ties appear to have contributed to the deaths 
of some detainees, including the elderly and 
infirm. 
(6) Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs who have 
obtained permanent residence or citizenship 
in other countries report being subjected to 
threats and harassment from Chinese offi-
cials. At least 5 journalists for Radio Free 
Asia’s Uyghur service have publicly detailed 
abuses their family members in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region have endured in 
response to their work exposing the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China’s abu-
sive policies. 
(7) In September 2018, United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle 
Bachelet noted in her first speech as High 
Commissioner the ‘‘deeply disturbing allega-
tions of large-scale arbitrary detentions of 
Uighurs and other Muslim communities, in 
so-called 
reeducation 
camps 
across 
Xinjiang’’. 
(8) In 2019, the Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China concluded that, based 
on available evidence, the establishment and 
actions committed in the internment camps 
in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region may 
constitute ‘‘crimes against humanity’’. 
(9) On December 31, 2018, President Donald 
J. Trump signed into law the Asia Reassur-
ance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115– 
409), which— 
(A) condemns the People’s Republic of Chi-
na’s ‘‘forced disappearances, extralegal de-
tentions, invasive and omnipresent surveil-
lance, and lack of due process in judicial pro-
ceedings’’; 
(B) authorizes funding to promote democ-
racy, human rights, and the rule of law in 
the People’s Republic of China; and 
(C) supports sanctions designations against 
any entity or individual that— 
(i) violates human rights or religious free-
doms; or 
(ii) engages in censorship activities. 
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the President should— 
(A) condemn abuses against Uyghurs, eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, members of other Mus-
lim minority groups, and other persons by 
authorities of the People’s Republic of 
China; and 
(B) call on such authorities to imme-
diately— 
(i) close the internment camps; 
(ii) lift all restrictions on, and ensure re-
spect for, human rights; and 
(iii) allow people inside the People’s Re-
public of China to reestablish contact with 
their loved ones, friends, and associates out-
side the People’s Republic of China; 
(2) the Secretary of State should consider 
strategically employing sanctions and other 
tools under the International Religious Free-
dom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.), in-
cluding measures resulting from the designa-
tion of the People’s Republic of China as a 
country of particular concern for religious 
freedom under section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii) of such 
Act (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)(ii)), that directly 
address particularly severe violations of reli-
gious freedom; 
(3) the Secretary of State should— 
(A) work with United States allies and 
partners and through multilateral institu-
tions to condemn the mass arbitrary deten-
tion of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority 
groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion; and 
(B) coordinate closely with the inter-
national community on targeted sanctions 
and visa restrictions; 
(4) the journalists of the Uyghur language 
service of Radio Free Asia should be com-
mended for their reporting on the human 
rights and political situation in Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region despite efforts 
by the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China to silence or intimidate their re-
porting through the detention of family 
members and relatives in China; 
(5) the United States should expand the 
availability of and capacity for Uyghur lan-
guage programming on Radio Free Asia in 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; 
(6) the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
appropriate United States law enforcement 
agencies should take steps to hold account-
able officials from the People’s Republic of 
China or individuals acting on their behalf 
who harass, threaten, or intimidate persons 
within the United States; and 
(7) United States companies and individ-
uals selling goods or services or otherwise 
operating in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region should take steps, including in any 
public or financial filings, to ensure that—

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SHERMAN) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include in the RECORD ex-
traneous material on S. 3744. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I should advise the 
House that we are taking up this bill 
about 11⁄2 hours earlier than expected, 
and I hope that our colleagues from the 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee 
have 
changed their schedule so that they 
can come to join us to speak on this 
bill. 
Let me point out that even in a pan-
demic, the American Congress focuses 
on human rights. 
Madam Speaker, let me start by 
thanking our colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle and both Chambers 
for their work on this legislation. I es-
pecially want to thank Senators RUBIO 
and MENENDEZ, and Representatives 
MCGOVERN, SHERMAN, SMITH, SUOZZI, 
and others who have worked for well 
more than a year, well more than 2 
years in most cases, to focus the 
world’s attention on the deprivation of 
human rights in Xinjiang province and 
to work for an appropriate American 
response. 
The Uyghur Human Rights Policy 
Act is the result of tireless work from 
so many individuals who focus on 
human rights. We have seen the report-
ing, the interviews, the pictures, the 
documentaries. The evidence is over-
whelming: The Chinese Government 
has brutally detained and reeducated 
or sought to reeducate over 1 million 
Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities, 
chiefly 
Muslim 
minorities, 
in 
the 
northwest of China. It is horrific. 
The goal of this inhumane campaign 
is clear: to force these minorities to as-
similate, to erase all evidence of their 
unique language, culture, history, and 
religion. 
Beijing has relied heavily on tech-
nology to carry out this abuse, trans-
forming the Uyghur region of Xinjiang 
into a surveillance state. But even as 
the world has learned more and more 
about the extent of these atrocities, 
there has been nowhere near enough 
action. 
Beijing has leveraged its economic 
clout to silence criticism of its horrific 
human rights abuses. So many coun-
tries, particularly Muslim countries 
that always speak out when any group 
of Muslims is being denied their human 
rights, have been pressured into si-
lence. Now, China wants the world to 
forget about the Uyghurs as we grapple 
with this global pandemic. 
We must push back. Today, we send a 
message loud and clear: We stand with 
the Uyghurs. We will fight for the op-
pressed. And we will not forget. 
By passing the Uyghur Human Rights 
Policy Act today, the United States 
takes a meaningful step toward holding 
the perpetrators accountable. This bill 
will impose sanctions on those individ-
uals responsible for human rights vio-
lations in Xinjiang. It also calls on our 
government experts to issue reports 
that can improve our understanding of 
the situation on the ground. 
The persecution of the Uyghurs is 
one of the greatest human rights trage-
dies currently taking place. We must 
stand on the right side of history and 
respond decisively. This legislation is a 
critical step forward, and I am proud to 
support its passage. I hope all Members 
of this body will join me in that effort, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the last several 
months have made it clear to the en-
tire world that the Chinese Communist

May 27, 2020 
Party, or the CCP, has little regard for 
human life. When faced with a decision, 
they have chosen and will continue to 
choose to preserve their own power 
over helping their own people. 
Rather than alert the world to the 
true dangers the coronavirus posed to 
the world, they instead lied and orches-
trated the worst coverup in human his-
tory, exposing the Chinese people and 
the entire world to a virus that has 
killed over 350,000 people, including 
nearly 100,000 innocent Americans. An-
other 5.5 million have been infected 
worldwide, and those numbers only 
continue to climb. 
This atrocity is far from the only ex-
ample of the CCP prioritizing its power 
over human life and liberty. At this 
very moment, the CCP’s rubber-stamp 
legislature is working to dismantle 
Hong Kong’s freedoms. Under the guise 
of national security legislation, the 
CCP plans to expand its police state to 
Hong Kong and fundamentally change 
Hong Kongers’ way of life, freedom, 
and autonomy. 
The CCP is showing the world that 
they are willing to tear up the inter-
national commitments they made to 
preserve freedom in Hong Kong. 
We can no longer stand idly by while 
the CCP consolidates its power at the 
expense of freedom around the world. 
The ultimate example of what the CCP 
is willing to do in the name of national 
security has been clear for some time, 
and that is the cultural genocide of the 
Uyghurs and other ethnic minority 
Muslim groups in western China. 
Over the last several years, these 
ethnic minorities have been rounded up 
and forced into concentration camps 
where they are brainwashed with state 
propaganda and forced to do grueling 
work as part of their ‘‘reform.’’ 
They live under a complete Orwellian 
surveillance program, an apparatus 
tracking their every move. Some have 
been tortured and killed. Others have 
been disappeared from their families, 
never to be returned, with no expla-
nation from the CCP. 
That is why I stand today in strong 
support of the Uyghur Human Rights 
Policy Act. 
The goal of the Chinese Government 
is to completely eradicate an entire 
culture simply because it doesn’t fit 
within what the Chinese Communist 
Party deems ‘‘Chinese.’’ They want to 
remove the cultural, religious, and eth-
nic identity the Uyghurs have and in-
doctrinate them so that they love the 
Chinese Communist Party more than 
their family, their culture, or their re-
ligion. In total, 1 to 3 million Chinese 
citizens have been subjected to the 
state-sponsored cultural genocide. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has 
called this the ‘‘stain of the century,’’ 
and he is absolutely right. 
That is why we can’t sit idly by and 
allow this to continue. As I have said 
before, our silence will be complicit, 
and our inaction will be our appease-
ment. But today we are acting, Madam 
Speaker, as a beacon of hope and free-
dom to the rest of the world, and the 
United States has a responsibility to 
take action. 
Now is the time for all of us, Repub-
lican and Democrat, as Americans to 
stand together and show the CCP that 
their egregious human rights abuses 
will not go unchecked. We can do that 
by passing this bill today with strong 
bipartisan support to show the Chinese 
Communist Party and the entire world 
that their treatment of the Muslim 
Uyghurs is inexcusable and will not be 
allowed without serious consequences. 
This legislation requires the Presi-
dent to submit a report that identifies 
Chinese Communist Party officials who 
have carried out these heinous crimes. 
These officials may then be sanctioned 
for their complicity. 
This bill also requires a separate 
human rights report that highlights 
abuses specifically to Xinjiang, China. 
Madam Speaker, I am hopeful that 
this is just one of many bipartisan ac-
tions that we can take as we push back 
on the world’s most oppressive dicta-
torship. 
We must acknowledge that the CCP 
is the greatest economic and national 
security threat of this generation. We 
must face this threat not as Repub-
licans or Democrats, but as Americans. 
As the chairman of the recently an-
nounced China Task Force in the 
House, I look forward to working with 
my colleagues to plan decisive action 
to push back on the CCP. We cannot 
allow the CCP to remain unchallenged 
on the world stage. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), chair 
of the Rules Committee, chair of the 
Congressional-Executive 
Commission 
on China, co-chair of the Tom Lantos 
Human Rights Commission, and a man 
who is known for his dedication to 
human rights. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
today, I am proud the House and Sen-
ate have come together in a bipartisan 
way to pass S. 3744, the Uyghur Human 
Rights Policy Act of 2020. 
This is monumental legislation that 
provides the administration a clear di-
rection for implementing U.S. policy 
and sends a clear message that the 
United States supports the human 
rights of Uyghurs and other ethnic mi-
nority groups in China. 
I thank Congressmen CHRIS SMITH, 
BRAD SHERMAN, and TOM SUOZZI, and 
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman 
ENGEL and Ranking Member MCCAUL 
for their leadership on this bill. 
We now believe that as many as 1.8 
million Uyghurs and other ethnic mi-
nority groups have been arbitrarily de-
tained in mass internment camps and 
subjected to forced labor, torture, and 
political indoctrination. 
In recent months, we have seen 
leaked internal Chinese Government 
documents that show the scope and im-
plementation of the mass internment 
camp system, including: evidence that 
the camp system is organized at the di-
rection of top Chinese Government of-
ficials, documentation that punish-
ments can be based on the behavior of 
their relatives outside the camps, out-
lining the use of coercive force and 
punishment inflicted upon inmates in a 
manual, guidance for how Chinese offi-
cials should use surveillance to deter-
mine who to detain in the camps, and 
evidence of the assignment of mass in-
ternment camp detainees to forced 
labor. 
b 1230 
There can be no doubt that the Chi-
nese Government is trying to stamp 
out the Uyghur identity. The policies 
of the Chinese Government contravene 
the letter and the spirit of the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights 
and violate the government’s obliga-
tions under the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, which 
China has signed but not ratified, and 
the International Covenant on Eco-
nomic, Social, and Cultural Rights 
ratified by China in 2001. 
It is important to always make clear 
that our criticism is focused on the 
Chinese Government. We respect the 
Chinese people, many of whom have 
suffered from and are victims of the au-
thoritarian policies of the government. 
Last year, the Congressional-Execu-
tive Commission on China, which I 
chair, published a report making the 
case that the persecution of Uyghurs 
may fit the definition of crimes against 
humanity as defined in Article 7 of the 
Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court. 
In March, the Simon-Skjodt Center 
for the Prevention of Genocide at the 
Holocaust Memorial Museum also de-
termined that there is a ‘‘reasonable 
basis to believe that the Government of 
China is committing crimes against 
humanity.’’ 
Passage of the legislation is an im-
portant first step, but there is much 
more that we need to do. 
First, the administration should im-
pose Global Magnitsky Act sanctions 
on Chinese officials who are directing 
ongoing human rights abuses, includ-
ing Chen Quanguo, the Xinjiang Com-
munist Party Secretary. 
Second, the administration should 
further expand the Commerce Depart-
ment’s ‘‘Entity List,’’ which imposes 
restrictions on businesses and entities 
that provide technology, training, or 
equipment that has been used in mass 
detentions or surveillance. 
Third, I have introduced the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act, H.R. 
6210, that would prohibit imports from 
Xinjiang to the United States unless 
companies can prove that their goods 
were not produced with forced labor. 
Too many U.S. and international 
companies are complicit in the exploi-
tation of the forced labor of Uyghur 
and other Muslim minorities. 
I am proud to stand in solidarity 
with the Uyghur, Chinese, Tibetan,

and, indeed, all the people living under 
the rule of the Chinese Government in 
their struggle to live freely, practice 
their religious beliefs freely, and speak 
their own languages freely. 
I look forward to the passage of this 
legislation and continuing our bipar-
tisan work together to support human 
rights in China. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), the House 
sponsor of the Uyghur Human Rights 
Policy Act. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank my good 
friend for his very strong remarks 
today and his leadership, BRAD SHER-
MAN
as well, and, of course, JIM 
MCGOVERN, as chairman, and I, as the 
ranking member of the China Commis-
sion, for the work that we have been 
doing to try to bring light to this ter-
rible human rights tragedy, this geno-
cide that is being committed against 
the Uyghur people. 
Madam Speaker, Communist Party 
General Secretary Xi Jinping’s ongoing 
genocide against the approximately 10 
million Uyghurs living in Xinjiang in 
northwestern China demands action. 
Today, more than a million Uyghurs 
are in concentration camps. Millions 
more are harassed, beaten, raped, and 
tortured. 
S. 3744, which is nearly identical to 
legislation H.R. 649 that I and my good 
friend Mr. SUOZZI and 136 bipartisan co-
sponsors introduced 17 months ago, re-
quires the administration to categorize 
and report on the human rights abuses 
being committed by the Chinese Gov-
ernment and take specific steps to 
sanction China’s officials for these 
abuses, including visa denial and asset 
blocking, the essence of the Magnitsky 
Act, which is the prohibition of all fi-
nancial transactions by an abuser. 
Madam Speaker, at a 2018 congres-
sional hearing, Mihrigul Tursun re-
counted her ordeal with torture, sexual 
abuse, and detention in one of Xi 
Jinping’s concentration camps. She 
broke down weeping, telling us that 
she pleaded with God to end her life. 
Her Chinese jailers restrained her to a 
table, increased the electrical current 
coursing through her body, and mocked 
her belief in God. 
She was tortured simply because she 
was an ethnic Uyghur and a Muslim 
living in China. 
Madam Speaker, there are millions 
of stories like this waiting to be told 
about the crimes against humanity 
being committed by the Chinese Gov-
ernment against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, 
and other Turkic Muslims. 
There are many people—we all know 
them; I have had them at my hearings 
in the past—women and men who have 
had their entire families back in this 
region, Xinjiang, arrested and put into 
concentration camps and harassed in 
other ways. 
Chinese authorities initially denied 
the existence of the concentration 
camps and even tried to portray them 
as vocational training centers. What a 
euphemism. They employed lies, cen-
sorship, and economic coercion to sti-
fle discussion of their crimes. 
Where have we heard that before? 
Look at what is going on with COVID– 
19 and the deceit and the lies that have 
come from Xi Jinping himself. 
But documents obtained by The New 
York Times and the International Con-
sortium of Investigative Journalists 
have, indeed, exposed the brutality be-
hind Beijing’s plans to radically and 
coercively transform the culture and 
religion of ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs, 
and other Muslims. 
The leaked documents showed de-
tailed plans to intern between 1 and 3 
million Uyghurs into concentration 
camps, where they are subjected to se-
vere human rights abuse and Orwellian 
indoctrination efforts for those whose 
thinking ‘‘has been infected’’—that is 
to say, they are Muslims. To Xi 
Jinping, that is something that needs 
to be obliterated. 
At the same time, Beijing instituted 
plans to erase the influence of Islam in 
western China, bulldozing mosques and 
shrines, severely throttling all reli-
gious practice, and forcing camp de-
tainees to renounce their faith. 
The leaked documents also show that 
Xi 
Jinping, 
himself, 
the 
so-called 
President—not elected by the people, of 
course—Xi Jinping, himself, directed 
the crackdown, saying that the Com-
munist Party must put the ‘‘organs of 
dictatorship’’ to work and show ‘‘abso-
lutely no mercy’’ in dealing with the 
Uyghurs and other Muslims. 
In one speech, President Xi said: 
‘‘The weapons of the people’s demo-
cratic dictatorship must be wielded 
without any hesitation or wavering.’’ 
Continuing the quote, in February 
2017, he told thousands of police offi-
cers and troops standing at attention 
in a vast square in Urumqi to prepare 
for a ‘‘smashing, obliterating offen-
sive,’’ which is exactly what they have 
done. 
According to documents obtained 
again by The New York Times, Com-
munist Party officials who were reluc-
tant to carry out Xi Jinping’s draco-
nian and horrific policies were them-
selves investigated and expunged. ‘‘Se-
cret teams of investigators have trav-
eled across the region identifying those 
who were not doing enough. In 2017, the 
party opened more than 12,000 inves-
tigations 
into 
party 
members 
in 
Xinjiang.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we cannot be silent. 
Xi Jinping is smashing and obliter-
ating an entire people. He is presiding 
over a genocide. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), a woman 
who has dedicated literally decades of 
her life to fighting for human rights, 
particularly 
in 
China, 
the 
distin-
guished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
thank him and Mr. MCCAUL, Mr. 
ENGEL, the chairman, ranking member, 
and senior member of the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee for bringing this im-
portant legislation to the floor. It is an 
honor to be here with all of them, and 
with Mr. SUOZZI, who has been a cham-
pion for religious rights throughout 
the world. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. SMITH and I go 
back decades in our fight for human 
rights in China, whether it is in Tibet, 
whether it is in Beijing, whether it is 
in Hong Kong. The list goes on and on. 
I thank Mr. SMITH for his ongoing lead-
ership. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank the 
chairman 
of 
the 
committee, 
Mr. 
MCGOVERN, the chair of the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China 
and chair of the Tom Lantos Human 
Rights Commission. Mr. SMITH is the 
ranking member of the Congressional- 
Executive Commission on China, and I 
thank Mr. SMITH. 
Today in this House of Representa-
tives, in a very strong, bipartisan way, 
we are sending a message to the per-
secuted that they are not forgotten. We 
are saying to the President of China: 
‘‘You may tell these people that they 
are forgotten, but they aren’t.’’ 
On the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives, in bipartisan, bicameral 
legislation, we are here in support of 
the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, 
strong bipartisan legislation to address 
and defend the rights and dignity of 
the Uyghur people from China’s oppres-
sion. 
Today, again, we are sending that 
message even as we are heartbroken as 
to what China’s people are suffering in 
terms of COVID–19 and that crisis. We 
are sad about that. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
CHRIS 
SMITH, again, and Mr. ENGEL and Mr. 
MCCAUL. I thank Senator RUBIO, also, 
for his leadership on this legislation. 
He has been a champion working with 
us on the China issues. 
Beijing’s barbarous actions targeting 
the Uyghur people are an outrage to 
the collective conscience of the world. 
Across Xinjiang, a Uyghur Autonomous 
Region, the Uyghur people and other 
Muslim minorities face brutal oppres-
sion, as Mr. SMITH was pointing out: 
A pervasive state of mass surveil-
lance and predictive policing used to 
discriminate and violate the human 
rights of minorities; 
The mass incarceration of more than 
1 million—and that is a small number, 
a very conservative, small number—in-
nocent people, with beatings, solitary 
confinement, deprivation of food and 
medical treatment, and the number is 
probably much larger than that; 
Forced sterilizations and other forms 
of torture; 
Incidents 
of 
mass 
shootings, 
extrajudicial killings, and the intimi-
dation and suppression of journalists 
courageously exposing the truth. 
Today, with this overwhelming bipar-
tisan legislation, the United States 
Congress is taking a firm step to 
counter Beijing’s horrific human rights 
abuses against the Uyghurs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2298 
May 27, 2020 
In the House, when brought to the 
floor in December, this legislation 
passed on a nearly unanimous basis. In 
the Senate, it passed under unanimous 
consent, with more than 50 cosponsors 
from both sides of the aisle. 
This legislation helps uncover the 
truth, requiring reports by the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence, State De-
partment, and FBI about the depths of 
the crisis and about China’s campaign 
against journalists exposing the facts. 
It creates accountability and ensures 
transparency of Chinese and foreign 
companies involved in the camps, and 
it engages the full firepower of Amer-
ican law and leadership, including by 
urging the application of targeted 
sanctions against those involved in the 
oppression of the Uyghur people. 
We must continue to raise a drum-
beat and shine a light on the abuse per-
petrated 
by 
Beijing 
against 
the 
Uyghurs whenever we can—from this 
House floor, to the State Department, 
to our multilateral institutions. 
Last Friday, as Speaker, I had the 
honor of appointing Nury Turkel, a 
human rights champion who was born 
in a camp in the Xinjiang region, to 
the 
United 
States 
Commission 
on 
International 
Religious 
Freedom, 
largely 
focused, 
with 
Ambassador 
Brownback’s leadership, on freedom of 
religion in many countries. There, I am 
confident that he will continue to be a 
powerful voice for the Uyghur people 
and for the cause of justice around the 
world. 
In just over a week—just think of 
it—the global community will mark 
the solemn milestone of 31 years since 
the Tiananmen Square massacre, when 
students, workers, and citizens were 
gunned down as they peacefully defied 
an oppressive regime to demand their 
liberties and human rights. 
Sadly, today, Beijing’s human rights 
abuses continue—blatantly continue— 
targeting so many, from the decades- 
long abuse faced by the Tibetan peo-
ple—many of us have visited Tibet and 
seen 
firsthand 
what 
is 
happening 
there—to Hong Kong’s fight for democ-
racy and the rule of law, which has 
once again been targeted in recent days 
in a very shameful way, to the jailing 
of journalists, human rights lawyers, 
Christians, and democracy advocates 
throughout the mainland. 
b 1245 
To honor all who have been per-
secuted, we must renew our commit-
ment to speaking out against China’s 
human rights abuses. If America does 
not speak out for human rights in 
China because of some commercial in-
terest, then we lose all moral authority 
to speak out on human rights viola-
tions anyplace in the world. It is a 
challenge to our conscience. We must 
do the right thing, and that is what we 
are doing today. 
In honor of the millions fighting for 
their dignity, safety, and rights in 
China and around the world, I strongly 
urge a bipartisan vote for the Uyghur 
Human Rights Policy Act of 2020. 
I again thank those responsible, Mr. 
MCCAUL, Mr. ENGEL, Mr. SHERMAN, Mr. 
SMITH, members of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, and Mr. SUOZZI, who has 
been a champion, as I say, on religious 
freedom throughout the world. 
I want to close by commending Mr. 
MCGOVERN, again, for being relentless 
and persistent in terms of shining a 
bright light on human rights violations 
throughout world and especially in 
China. 
Madam Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, so I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. SUOZZI), an advocate for 
human and religious rights. 
Mr. 
SUOZZI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman, the ranking mem-
ber, and Congressman SMITH for their 
good work and partnership on this 
issue. 
I thank Chairman MCGOVERN
and 
Speaker PELOSI for their leadership on 
all issues of human rights. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the bipartisan Uyghur Human 
Rights Policy Act of 2020, which holds 
the Chinese Communist Party account-
able for the horrific treatment of 
Uyghur Muslim minorities, including 
forced labor camps in western China, 
over 1 million Uyghurs in mass intern-
ment who are subjected to systemized 
brainwashing, Big Brother-like surveil-
lance, and gross violations of their reli-
gious freedom. 
Since President Nixon went to China 
in 1971, most Americans have believed 
that with increased economic integra-
tion and exposure to our system of de-
mocracy and our way of life, that 
China would become more like us. 
Clearly, that has not happened. 
Not only does the Chinese Com-
munist Party reject any real steps to-
ward democracy, withhold information 
from the world community regarding 
the coronavirus, continue its unfair 
trade practices, and cheat by stealing 
our intellectual property, but it con-
tinually violates human rights, as we 
have seen, not only in Xinjiang with 
the Uyghurs, but also in Tibet with the 
Buddhists, and in Hong Kong with the 
students and the journalists. 
Representative CHRIS
SMITH
and I 
originally introduced legislation re-
garding abuse of the Uyghurs in No-
vember of 2018 and, while it has taken 
too long, it is never too late to speak 
out for human rights and penalize 
China for its egregious violations. 
Madam Speaker, Uyghur families are 
prohibited from practicing their faith. 
They are often separated from their 
family members and prohibited from 
reading the Koran and making their 
daily prayers and, in some instances, 
they are forced to eat pork during 
Ramadan. 
The so-called ‘‘re-education camps’’ 
in China, where Uyghurs are forced to 
work in textile or manufacturing jobs 
in or near mass internment camps are 
not only repugnant to our values, but 
also taint global supply chains. 
The brutal, religious-based persecu-
tion of the Uyghurs in China is alarm-
ing but not new. China has continued 
to repress anyone who does not con-
form to their system, including Tibet-
ans, Christians, and the people of Hong 
Kong. 
Just last week in Hong Kong, the 
Chinese Communist Party proposed na-
tional security legislation that would 
erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and civil 
liberties. We must remain vigilant. 
This bill holds the Chinese Com-
munist Party and Politburo members 
like Chen Quanguo accountable for 
their abuses. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the passage of this 
important, bipartisan legislation. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), an ad-
vocate for human rights. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from California 
for his leadership. I thank Mr. SMITH 
for his leadership as well, and the gen-
tleman from Texas, my colleague, for 
his leadership; and listening to the 
Speaker for her continued years of 
leadership. 
The treatment of Uyghurs in China, 
which warranted the call for the 
Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 
2020, S. 3744, the treatment is of such 
volcanic, mammoth proportions that 
we cannot even describe it on this 
floor. 
We, in America, take our faith so se-
riously. We are gratified that whatever 
our faith is, and whatever the time 
that we have for our particular faith, 
whether we go to confession as Catho-
lics or whether or not we take com-
munion, as many faiths do, whether we 
honor Easter as a special moment for 
Christians of resurrection, whether or 
not we know the Passover and the 
specialness of that, or whether as Mus-
lims we know Ramadan, we are clearly 
ones that understand how much faith is 
a part of our life. 
Can you imagine being in a country 
that brutalizes you because you prac-
tice your faith; keeps you from reading 
the very book that gives you faith and 
inspiration, the Koran, and then, doing 
the most dastardly act, which is to sep-
arate you from your families? 
Of course, many of us know, Rama-
dan just finished with Eid on Saturday. 
Americans who are Muslims had the 
opportunity to do and practice their 
faith and share it with their families 
without recrimination and violence. 
Just imagine a Uyghur in China, 
fearful of your life, and not having the 
ability to practice your faith; and as 
one of my colleagues said, the worst, 
forcing you to eat pork and continuing 
to subject you to penalties and punish-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2299 
May 27, 2020 
So, I rise to support this legislation 
because we can do nothing less but to 
support the Human Rights Policy Act 
for the Uyghurs and bring them out of 
the terrible tragedy of oppression in 
China. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Just today, the Secretary of State 
announced, 
under 
the 
Hong 
Kong 
Human Rights and Democracy Act that 
we passed last November which re-
quires an annual certification of Hong 
Kong’s autonomy, he just announced 
that he cannot certify the autonomous 
nature of Hong Kong. 
This is a very significant day, Madam 
Speaker, because the Chinese Com-
munist Party now has cracked down on 
the free and loving people of Hong 
Kong and their autonomous nature 
under one country, two systems, back 
when the U.K.-Sino pact was signed. 
The CCP, Chinese Communist Party, 
are in violation now of the Sino-U.K. 
pact. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
bill, 
the 
Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 
2020 is more proof that we can come to-
gether, as Republicans and Democrats, 
to address the generational threat by 
the Chinese Communist Party and 
champion American values. 
Whether it be the Muslim population 
of the Uyghurs, whether it be the Ti-
betan population who have been per-
secuted, and the Dalai Lama, who is in 
exile, to the Christians who are per-
secuted in China by the Communist 
Party, this bill will help hold the Chi-
nese Communist Party accountable for 
their atrocities and will show the 
world, including the Uyghur Muslim 
American community, that the United 
States Congress will not tolerate these 
appalling human rights violations. We 
will always stand for human rights 
across the globe. 
And the one thing I respect about our 
committee, the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, is that we stand together when 
it comes to our foreign policy. As 
Chairman ENGEL often says, partisan-
ship stops at the water’s edge. And 
when it comes to human rights, we 
stand with our Founding Fathers and 
what they stood for in fighting oppres-
sion and tyranny and for democracy 
and freedom. 
That is why, today, we stand with 
the 
Uyghur 
Muslim 
population 
in 
China. And for all those listening in 
China and, particularly, to those mem-
bers of the Chinese Communist Party 
who are probably watching this broad-
cast on C–SPAN, we are watching you 
today. We will not back down. We will 
talk about this until it stops, and it 
will stop, hopefully, in our lifetime. It 
won’t stop this Congress, but it must 
stop. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SHERMAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
having no further speakers, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
The bill before us represents a num-
ber of different bills in the Senate and 
the House, all of which have been 
blended together. All of these bills con-
tain important complementary meas-
ures to counter one of the most impor-
tant human rights violations of the 
present day, detention of over 1 million 
Uyghurs and other Muslims in the 
Xinjiang Province of China. 
In particular, as chair of the Asia, 
the Pacific, and Nonproliferation Sub-
committee, back in February of last 
year, I joined with our ranking mem-
ber, TED YOHO, and Congressman CON-
NOLLY and Congresswoman WAGNER in 
introducing the Uighur Act. That legis-
lation added to this bill the imposition 
of sanctions on individuals and entities 
found to have committed gross human 
rights abuses against Uyghurs, ethnic 
Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of 
other Muslim minority groups and 
other persons in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
autonomous region. 
This bill, I should point out, is not 
one that just expresses the view of Con-
gress; not one that just demands re-
ports be issued by the State Depart-
ment to refocus the world on what is 
going with the Uyghurs and others. 
This bill imposes sanctions on those re-
sponsible. 
The Chinese Communist Party has 
sought to erase the distinct Uyghur 
Muslim culture and religious traditions 
through mass detentions, re-education, 
and a coordinated campaign called 
‘‘Strike Hard Against Violent Extre-
mism’’ launched in 2014. Thanks to 
leaked Chinese Communist Party docu-
ments, we now know the impetus of 
this campaign came from the highest 
levels of the party. 
In April of 2014, General Secretary Xi 
Jinping ordered party officials to show 
‘‘absolutely no mercy’’ in using the 
‘‘organs of dictatorship’’ to suppress 
Muslim minorities. More than a mil-
lion Uyghurs have been imprisoned. 
And they have been imprisoned be-
cause, in the words of the Chinese Com-
munist Party, ‘‘their thinking has been 
infected by unhealthy thoughts.’’ 
It appears, according to the Chinese 
Communist Party, a dedication to reli-
gion or to freedom and democracy is 
unhealthy and justifies incarceration. 
Along with the re-education camps, 
the Strike Hard campaign has also in-
volved high-tech surveillance and mon-
itoring of the Uyghurs, monitoring and 
suppressing Muslim religious practice, 
including funeral practices, and sup-
pression of the Uyghur language. 
And the party has acted beyond the 
borders of China, intimidating Chinese 
Muslim 
minorities 
who 
are 
living 
abroad, preventing them, including 
some who are permanent residents of 
the United States, from leaving the 
Xinjiang region. 
The legislation before us is an impor-
tant start, but it is just a start in our 
efforts to counter Chinese repression of 
its Muslim minorities. 
I think I have already highlighted 
the sanctions in this bill. In particular, 
the bill requires the President to block 
assets of and deny and revoke visas 
with respect to any foreign person, in-
cluding a Chinese Government official, 
who are determined to be responsible 
for the suppression and inhumane 
treatment of Uyghurs and other Mus-
lim minorities in Xinjiang Province. 
So I want to thank Chairman ENGEL 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who 
has put together the most bipartisan 
committee in either House of Congress; 
Ranking Member MCCAUL, who has 
been an important part of that; Speak-
er PELOSI, who spoke to us earlier; our 
colleagues 
CHRIS
SMITH
and 
TOM 
SUOZZI, who have spoken to us earlier 
as well; Senators MARCO
RUBIO
and 
ROBERT
MENENDEZ; my colleague in 
running the Asia, the Pacific, and Non-
proliferation Subcommittee, TED YOHO; 
as well as GERRY CONNOLLY, ANN WAG-
NER, and everyone else who has been 
involved in the legislation. 
I hope that we will see Muslim coun-
tries particularly in the world—but all 
countries—be willing to stand up to 
Beijing and speak out against this 
human rights travesty. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of S. 3744. the Uyghur Human Rights 
Policy Act of 2020. I was proud to join Con-
gressman CHRIS SMITH to introduce an earlier 
version of this important legislation at the be-
ginning of last year and I’m glad to that we are 
finally able to get this legislation across the 
finish line today. 
As a senior Member of the House Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, and a committed de-
fender of human rights, I have watched over 
the years as the Chinese Communist Party 
(CCP) routinely mistreats its people. The list of 
abuses is too long to recount here but it spans 
every sector of human life from religious free-
dom, to due process protections, to press 
freedom and freedom of assembly, to China’s 
notorious population policies. Pretty much 
every freedom in our Bill of Rights is lacking 
in China. 
Religious freedom, specifically, is a long-
standing issue. The CCP seems to think that 
religion is a fundamental enemy. Not only are 
Christians hounded and mistreated, but Falun 
Gong practitioners are brutally persecuted, 
with many having their organs harvested invol-
untarily. 
That brings us to the situation in Xinjiang 
and the Orwellian nightmare faced by Uyghur 
Muslims there today. As the problem has got-
ten worse and more facts have come out, the 
situation has become clear. China imprisons 
somewhere between one and three million 
Uyghurs in concentration camps where they 
undergo indoctrination and forced labor. Many 
are tortured. For Uyghurs outside the camps, 
the CCP also makes life difficult, subjecting 
them to intense surveillance and policing. No-
tably, Uyghurs both in and outside the camps 
are made to eat foods forbidden to Muslims 
and forced to abandon other practices of their 
faith. The Party even pursues Uyghurs in 
other countries by attempting to control their 
behavior through threats against family mem-
bers still in China and by pressuring other 
countries to send them back to China.

No one deserves to live with this kind of 
persecution which is why this malicious treat-
ment of the Uyghurs by the CCP must brought 
to an end. We all wish to see the day when 
China behaves like, and can be treated as, a 
normal country. Until that time, we delude our-
selves if we treat it like one. That is why we 
must enact the Uyghur Human Rights Policy 
Act today.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF THE SENATE AMENDMENTS 
TO H.R. 6172, USA FREEDOM RE-
AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 981 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 981 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to take from the 
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 6172) to amend 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of

with the Senate amendments thereto, and to 
consider in the House, without intervention 
of any point of order, a single motion offered 
by the chair of the Committee on the Judici-
ary or his designee that the House concur in 
the Senate amendments. The Senate amend-
ments and the motion shall be considered as 
read. The motion shall be debatable for one 
hour equally divided among and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on the Judiciary and the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Permanent

the objections of the President are spread at 
large upon the Journal, further consider-
ation of the veto message and the joint reso-
lution shall be postponed until the legisla-
tive day of Wednesday, July 1, 2020; and on 
that legislative day, the House shall proceed 
to the constitutional question of reconsider-
ation and dispose of such question without 
intervening motion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the Rules Committee met and reported 
a rule, House Resolution 981, providing 
for consideration of Senate amend-
ments to H.R. 6172. The rule makes in 
order a motion offered by the chair of 
the Committee on the Judiciary or his 
designee that the House concur in the 
Senate amendments. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate on 
the motion, equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary and the chair and the rank-
ing member of the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence. The rule 
provides that any motion pursuant to 
clause 4 of rule XXII relating H.R. 6172 
may be offered only by the majority 
leader or his designee. Finally, the rule 
allows for consideration of a possible 
veto message on H.J. Res. 76 on July 1, 
2020. 
Madam Speaker, the protection of 
civil 
liberties 
has 
always 
been 
a 
uniquely American value. I opposed the 
original PATRIOT Act and subsequent 
reauthorizations because I believe they 
crossed the line and compromised 
Americans’ fundamental right to pri-
vacy. 
We can prevent crime and terrorism 
without 
our 
government 
collecting 
data on law-abiding citizens. I have 
said that whether there has been a Re-
publican President or a Democratic 
President in the White House. 
This has not been a partisan notion, 
either. There are Members on both 
sides of the aisle who have consistently 
said the same. When I worked with my 
colleagues 
MARK
POCAN
and 
TOM 
MASSIE to introduce what was called 
the strongest antisurveillance bill to 
date, it was done with bipartisan sup-
port. 
It is no surprise, then, that I don’t 
support the underlying bill either. 
Every day, we ask Americans to choose 
between their right to privacy and a 
false sense of security. That is not a 
choice we should have to make. 
Having said that, other Members in 
this Chamber—Democrats and Repub-
licans—feel differently, and it is the 
Rules Committee’s job to advance leg-
islation to the floor. 
A 
FISA 
reauthorization 
recently 
passed this Chamber with the support 
of over two-thirds of our Members. I 
did 
not 
support 
it. 
The 
Senate 
strengthened the bill, but quite frank-
ly, it is not strong enough for me, 
though I do appreciate some of its re-
forms. 
Now, each Member will have to de-
cide where they stand. I know the 
President hasn’t made this process 
easy. He has thrown a last-minute 
wrench into the process with his 
tweeting. If this bill passes, it will go 
directly to his desk. I am not sure if he 
will sign it or not. I am not sure he 
knows, quite frankly. 
But we are giving every Member the 
chance to cast a straight up-or-down 
vote. Ultimately, the House will have 
worked its will. 
I have said many times that I oppose 
this bill. The Government of the 
United States should not be able to go 
on fishing expeditions against citizens 
who haven’t even broken the law. That 
is not a radical idea. To me, that is a 
fundamentally American idea. I don’t 
want seemingly unlimited and, in my 
view, unconstitutional powers in the 
hands of President Trump and Attor-
ney General Barr or any administra-
tion. 
This Attorney General, quite frank-
ly, has no respect for the rule of law. 
That is my view. I don’t trust him. 
I don’t care whether it is a Repub-
lican or a Democrat in the White 
House. We can, and we must, fight ter-
rorism and deter wrongdoing in a way 
that better respects Americans’ civil 
liberties. 
Madam Speaker, this is a serious 
matter. It deserves to be handled more 
responsibly than by a late-night tweet. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2301 
May 27, 2020 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, my chairman is ex-
actly right. We just came out of the 
Rules Committee just about an hour 
ago, and we did report this rule that 
does make in order a motion from the 
chairman of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary to concur in the Senate amend-
ments. The Senate amendments do 
take a small step forward in making 
the underlying language better than it 
used to be, but we had an opportunity 
in the Rules Committee to consider 
other amendments. 
We had an amendment by Mr. GOSAR, 
for example, that asked for additional 
certifications from the Attorney Gen-
eral. We had a bipartisan amendment 
from Mr. DAVIDSON and Ms. LOFGREN 
that would have gone even further in 
protecting civil liberties. I regret the 
rule we have today makes neither of 
those in order. 
It comes as no surprise to any of us 
that we have some very successful 
House work product that we could have 
added here, and we made the decision 
to accede to the Senate language. 
As I mentioned, just over an hour 
ago, Dr. BURGESS, who sits on the 
Rules Committee, and I were there. 
Madam Speaker, with the chairman’s 
indulgence, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS) for any statement he 
may have. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I do want to point 
out that the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act of 1978—note the first 
word is ‘‘Foreign’’—the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act of 1978 pro-
vided authorities for the collection of 
foreign intelligence information to pro-
tect the United States from foreign 
threats. These authorities were ex-
panded after 9/11, and their use has ex-
ceeded the original intent. 
The Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Court provides authorization via 
court order. Inspector General Horo-
witz’s recent report revealed inten-
tional abuse of the FISA process by 
FBI officials investigating the Trump 
campaign, investigating the Trump 
campaign for alleged collusion with 
Russia during the 2016 Presidential 
campaign. After extensive study by 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller, no 
such connection could be found. 
In addition, agents of the FBI report-
edly used official meetings with then- 
President-elect Trump and incoming 
National 
Security 
Advisor 
Michael 
Flynn for the purposes of gathering in-
formation on them, intelligence infor-
mation. These politically driven ac-
tions by the FBI were highly irregular; 
inappropriate; and, in the case of inac-
curate FISA court applications, actu-
ally criminal. 
It is not legal to lie to a FISA court 
judge. Yet, no one has been held ac-
countable. No one has stood trial. Cer-
tainly, no one has served a sentence to 
account for these crimes. 
Madam Speaker, what is the point of 
passing a law if the enforcement agen-
cy is the one abusing it? This is mal-
feasance of the highest order, and it 
certainly must not go unpunished. 
Let’s be clear: We all want to protect 
the American people. Part of that re-
sponsibility includes authorizing cer-
tain activities by our intelligence 
agencies to obtain critical information 
on foreign targets. But, no, Americans’ 
civil liberties should not be jettisoned 
for that effort. 
When the House first passed H.R. 
6172, the reauthorization of the USA 
FREEDOM Act, I supported the bill be-
cause of the improvements that were 
made to the FISA process. But since 
then, we have learned details that indi-
cate that the abuse was much more 
widespread and much more deliberate 
than initially reported. 
Given that, rather than place some 
additional requirements on the exer-
cise of existing authorities, I think we 
must fully reevaluate the FISA au-
thorities to resolve the right balance 
between protecting our Nation and the 
rights of the American people. 
In addition, the administration does 
not support this bill in its current 
form, which means that this is going to 
be yet another in a long line of activi-
ties undertaken by the Democratic ma-
jority that is not going to be success-
ful. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the under-
lying bill. It has nothing do with the 
Mueller investigation into the collu-
sion between Trump operatives and the 
Russians. 
Quite frankly, I look back at that 
episode in our history with great con-
cern. A foreign power intervened in our 
election, and people close to the Presi-
dent lied about their interaction with 
the Russians, including General Mi-
chael Flynn, whom my colleague just 
referred to. He lied to the FBI, but he 
doesn’t need to worry because the 
President is going to pardon him, or at 
least alluded to pardoning him because 
he is his friend. 
It is that kind of lack of respect for 
the law that has me concerned about 
giving more power to this administra-
tion to be able to surveil American 
citizens. 
By the way, the Attorney General is 
recommending a veto on this because 
he thinks it is too restrictive. He wants 
more power. This Attorney General 
wants more power. Give me a break. 
Madam Speaker, people have dif-
ferences of opinion on the underlying 
bill. There are Democrats who strongly 
support it, and there are Democrats 
who oppose it. There are Republicans 
who strongly support it, at least they 
did until the President did his tweet 
last night, and Republicans who oppose 
it. So, people can vote however they 
want to vote. 
But my opposition to the underlying 
bill is longstanding, and I am not going 
to sit here and listen to somebody try 
to rewrite history as to what happened 
between 
the 
Russians 
and 
Trump 
operatives. What happened should dis-
turb every American, Democrat or Re-
publican. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), my 
chairman, knows the great respect that 
I have for him—in fact, the great affec-
tion that I have for him. 
Madam Speaker, I can tell him with 
complete sincerity that I have no in-
terest in rewriting history, but I do 
have an interest in rewriting the fu-
ture. And as we stand here today, my 
support for the underlying legislation 
does not wane because of a Presidential 
tweet; my belief that the legislation 
will be signed into law wanes because 
of a Presidential tweet. 
Madam Speaker, whether you are on 
the side that says this bill is doing too 
much or whether you are on the side 
that says this bill is doing too little, if 
you are on the side that says we can do 
better together, then going down a 
path that the President’s team has said 
would result in a veto advantages none 
of us. 
Madam Speaker, it is painful. This is 
my last year in this institution, and I 
love this institution not because of the 
history that is in these walls, not be-
cause of the ancient tomes that I see 
here on Mr. GRIFFITH’s desk, but be-
cause of the people who sacrifice them-
selves and their families on behalf of 
something that is bigger than them-
selves. 
This idea that it is the United States 
of America that you and I have the 
privilege of playing a small leadership 
role in, that is universal. To be here on 
the floor of the House today, again, ac-
centuating our divisions on a bill that 
is going nowhere, is worthless to me. 
Madam Speaker, I love being on the 
House floor with my friend, the chair-
man, when he is full thunder on behalf 
of his ideas and his principles and I 
have to take the other side. That kind 
of debate, those kinds of differences of 
opinions among people who respect one 
another but simply come at things 
from a different perspective, that is ex-
actly what this House was intended to 
produce. 
Madam Speaker, to be here on the 
floor today, when my friend from Mas-
sachusetts is having to carry a rule for 
a bill that he opposes and wants to de-
feat, I am down here telling you that 
we had a great bipartisan solution, but 
we are not going to be able to talk 
about it on the House floor. 
So, I have a bill that I support the 
underlying vision of but know it is 
going to go absolutely nowhere, and we 
are just going to back folks into their 
political corners. That is not what our 
constituents expect from us, and it is 
not, I would argue, what we have come

to expect from ourselves. It, sadly, is 
what the political theater advocates 
have come to expect from us. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to a new rule to suspend the 
proxy voting until the D.C. Federal dis-
trict court reviews a lawsuit and deter-
mines an outcome. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
thinking 
about 
things that are within the walls of this 
institution, all the stories these walls 
tell, they will never tell a story of a 
single Member of Congress ever casting 
a vote from outside of this room where 
we are standing. Never has it happened. 
I would argue the Constitution flatly 
prohibits it. I cannot understand how 
one can read the Constitution dif-
ferently. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include in the RECORD the 
text of my amendment, along with ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
b 1515 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
reference the tomes that sit on the 
gentleman from Virginia’s desk. 
At this time, I would like to yield 5 
minutes to my good friend and, actu-
ally, Madam Speaker, as you know, 
someone who has worked in a bipar-
tisan way, a surprising bipartisan 
way—never fails to surprise Members 
on both sides of the aisle—to protect 
this institution and all that it means 
to the American people. 
There are many folks in this institu-
tion, Madam Speaker, I don’t mind dis-
agreeing with; and, in fact, the fact 
that we are on other sides humbly 
leads me to believe I am even more 
right than I thought that I was. When 
I find myself disagreeing with the gen-
tleman from Virginia, I find myself 
having to go back and reflect on ex-
actly why that is we have come down 
on different sides. And those individ-
uals in this Chamber who provide us 
with that counsel, Madam Speaker, 
you know that we hold in such high re-
gard. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIF-
FITH). 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the kind words of my good 
friend and colleague, and we will miss 
him when he goes on to do greater 
things elsewhere. 
Madam Speaker, if we do not pass the 
motion to proceed to the previous ques-
tion, we can put the proxy quorum vot-
ing rule on hold until after the courts 
have time to rule on its constitu-
tionality. 
Most on this side of the aisle and a 
handful on the other side of the aisle 
strongly believe that this proxy voting 
rule is unconstitutional. Accordingly, 
yesterday, a suit was filed to have the 
rule declared unconstitutional. 
Under the suit, the court is asked to 
do many things, including asking for 
an injunction of our Clerk from count-
ing the proxy votes on any measure 
and on counting proxies for purposes of 
determining a quorum. The courts 
must weigh in on this controversy be-
fore we take important votes using this 
new proxy quorum voting scheme. 
The suit lays out constitutional re-
quirements. Many of these arguments 
were made previously. It goes through 
the definitions of words like ‘‘to meet,’’ 
‘‘assemble,’’ et cetera. 
Madam Speaker, as you know, words 
are important and the meanings are 
important, and the filers of this suit 
couldn’t have made me happier. When I 
was reading it, they used Samuel John-
son’s dictionary of 1773. And just to let 
you know exactly how oddball I can be, 
I pulled my copy of Samuel Johnson’s 
of 1773 off the shelf in my office. I 
checked to see what they had written 
down, and they got it exactly right. 
The term ‘‘meet’’ meant ‘‘to encounter, 
to be close face-to-face.’’ 
And in 1851, the Webster’s dictionary 
says ‘‘to come together or approach 
near, or into company with; to assem-
ble, to congregate.’’ The example they 
used in Webster’s in 1851 was: ‘‘The leg-
islature will meet on the first Wednes-
day in March.’’ Clearly, they knew 
what it meant to come together face- 
to-face. 
Today, 
on 
the 
internet—knowing 
that some out there would say, ‘‘MOR-
GAN, get yourself out of the dusty 
books’’—it says, meet: to come into the 
presence of; to come face-to-face. 
And ‘‘assemble,’’ similarly, in John-
son’s, it means ‘‘to bring together into 
one place’’; Webster’s: ‘‘To collect a 
number of individuals into one place or 
body’’; 
internet, 
Merriam-Webster’s, 
today: ‘‘To bring together, as in a par-
ticular place.’’ 
The suit lays out the constitutional 
requirements. Many of these argu-
ments were made, as I said, previously. 
Now, I know what many of you are 
thinking. MORGAN, you have got to get 
modern. Zoom is a place, as is Webex 
and a dozen others. Some say that if 
they had only known about it during 
the writing of the Constitution, they 
would have permitted it; but, Madam 
Speaker, they had the written word 
and they had the ability to send let-
ters. 
They also knew about dangers. They 
knew about wars with other nations, 
later, the burning of D.C., the Civil 
War. 
Multiple 
plagues 
and 
fears 
have 
gripped the capitals of this country, 
but they never contemplated sending a 
note or a letter by friend or by post, 
saying—and can you imagine it saying: 
‘‘Hey, give my vote to Harry Lee of 
Virginia or William Holman of Indiana. 
And not only count my vote as a vote 
on the bill, but count me present as a 
part of the quorum’’? 
Never did it, never thought they 
should, never thought they could. 
So the lawsuit challenging the con-
stitutionality of this so-called rule is 
well-founded. 
Also, it is important we think about 
how the newfangled proxy quorum rule 
affects our work today. Some may say: 
‘‘Let the courts do their thing and we 
will sort it out later.’’ Well, that is 
more than just sloppy legislating; it is 
dangerous. 
MORGAN, you say, how is that? 
Let me explain. As an example, we 
are preparing to vote on the reauthor-
ization of the Federal Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act, FISA. On that, or any 
other vote that does anything of im-
port, no matter how small—even the 
naming of a post office, because it 
spends money—the vote and the action 
of this House, under the proxy quorum 
rule, is tainted and the authority of 
that legislation, accordingly, called 
into question. 
On FISA, if we pass it and the courts 
rule that the proxy quorum voting rule 
is unconstitutional, in whole or in 
part, we will have handed either a get- 
out-of-jail-free card to terrorists who 
are enemies of the United States or a 
hammer they can use against prosecu-
tors trying to pursue justice. 
Is that really what we want to do? I 
know it is not. And we have another 
way. We can put the proxy quorum rule 
on hold, suspend it until the courts can 
make a final ruling on its constitu-
tionality. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. We can put the proxy 
quorum rule on hold. We can suspend it 
until the courts can make a final rul-
ing on its constitutionality. Once we 
have that answer, we can then move 
forward. But to move forward without 
knowing where we are going on con-
stitutionality is dangerous, damaging, 
and destructive to every act we take in 
this body. 
Madam Speaker, I would implore the 
Members of this House: Do not vote the 
party line. Do not say, ‘‘Oh, it is a pre-
vious question, it is a throwaway 
vote.’’ Today, the previous question is 
an important vote on whether we move 
forward not knowing the way or wheth-
er we move forward knowing whether 
it is constitutional or unconstitu-
tional. 
I ask you all to vote for our great Re-
public and this august body. Vote ‘‘no’’ 
on the previous question and put the 
proxy quorum rule on hold until we 
have a definitive answer. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I want to thank the gentleman for 
reading from Webster’s Dictionary to 
all of us, but I want to read from the 
Constitution. And let me quote: ‘‘Each 
House may determine the rules of its 
proceedings.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
a 
letter 
from 
Erwin 
Chemerinsky, the renowned constitu-
tional expert and dean of Berkeley 
School of Law, discussing the view that

the remote voting process we are con-
sidering today would, in fact, be con-
stitutional. 
In the letter, the dean says: ‘‘The 
Constitution bestows in each House of 
Congress broad discretion to determine 
the rules for its own proceedings. . . . 
This authority is expansive and would 
include the ability to adopt a rule to 
permit proxy voting. Nothing in the

‘‘Moreover, if this were challenged in 
court, it is very likely that the case 
would be dismissed as a political ques-
tion. The Supreme Court has ruled that 
challenges to the internal operation of

written, the Court often ‘has held that 
congressional judgments pertaining to 
its internal governance should not be 
reviewed by the Federal judiciary.’ ’’ 
BERKELEY LAW, 
May 13, 2020. 
Chairman MCGOVERN and Ranking Member 
COLE, 
House Rules Committee, House of Representa-
tives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN
AND RANKING 
MEMBER COLE: I have been asked for my view 
as to whether the House of Representatives 
could constitutionally adopt a rule to permit 
remote voting by proxy. As explained below, 
I believe that this would be constitutional 
and it is very unlikely that any court would 
invalidate such a rule, especially in light of 
the current public health emergency. 
My understanding is that the system of re-
mote voting by proxy that is being consid-
ered would have some key features: 
Low-tech remote voting process through 
proxy voting; 
Some number of Members would be present 
on the Floor for debate and in-Chamber vot-
ing; 
Proxy would be used to establish a quorum 
and to register the yeas/nays; 
The proxy holder would be another Mem-
ber of the House; 
The proxy holder would have NO discretion 
on the vote. Instead, the proxy holder would 
be required (through the rule and accom-
panying regulations) to cast the vote in ac-
cordance with the specific and exact instruc-
tion from the Member. 
The Constitution bestows on each House of 
Congress broad discretion to determine the 
rules for its own proceedings. Article I, sec-
tion 5 of the Constitution says: ‘‘Each House 
may determine the Rules of its proceedings.’’ 
This authority is expansive and would in-
clude the ability to adopt a rule to permit 
proxy voting. Nothing in the Constitution 
specifies otherwise. 
Moreover, if this were challenged in court, 
it is very likely that the case would be dis-
missed as a political question. The Supreme 
Court has ruled that challenges to the inter-
nal operation of Congress are not justiciable 
in the federal courts. See Field v. Clark, 143 
U.S. 649 (1892). Indeed, I have written, the 
Court often ‘‘has held that congressional 
judgments pertaining to its internal govern-
ance should not be reviewed by the federal 
judiciary.’’ Erwin Chernerinsky, Constitu-
tional Law: Principles and Policies § 2.8.5 
(6th ed. 2019). 
Especially in the context of the current 
public health emergency, it is highly un-
likely that any court would review and in-
validate the procedures adopted by the 
House of Representatives that would allow it 
to conduct its business without endangering 
the health of its members and its staff. 
Every branch of government is devising new 
procedures to accomplish this. The Supreme 
Court, for example, will conduct oral argu-
ments by telephone for the first time in its 
history. I am sure that the rules will ensure 
that the votes cast by proxy are accurate 
and carefully recorded. 
I hope that this is helpful. Please do not 
hesitate to let me know if I can be of further 
assistance. 
Sincerely, 
ERWIN CHEMERINSKY. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. I include in the 
RECORD
a 
letter 
from 
Deborah 
Pearlstein, 
constitutional 
law 
pro-
fessor from Cardozo School of Law. 
In her letter, which I strongly rec-
ommend all of my colleagues read in 
full, Professor Pearlstein writes: ‘‘ . . . 
I believe adopting procedures to allow 
for remote voting under these extraor-
dinary circumstances is not only law-
ful, but essential to the maintenance of 
our constitutional democracy.’’ 
‘‘The Constitution . . . contains no 
specific requirement of physical pres-
ence for Members to vote. What the 
Constitution 
does 
instead—as 
the 
courts have repeatedly recognized—is

bers to give ‘unanimous consent’ to a

CARDOZO LAW, 
April 16, 2020. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN: Thank you for 
your statement today recommending the im-
plementation of temporary remote voting 
procedures in Congress during this tragic 
pandemic. As a professor of constitutional 
law, and a scholar who has written exten-
sively on separation of powers issues in U.S. 
Government, I believe adopting procedures 
to allow for remote voting under these ex-
traordinary circumstances is not only law-
ful, but essential to the maintenance of our 
constitutional democracy. Recognizing that 
specific procedures for remote voting may 
still be in development, the analysis offered 
here focuses foremost on the broad scope of 
Congress’ constitutional authority to regu-
late its voting procedures. 
As with much else in the Constitution, the 
description the text provides of how Con-
gress is to fulfill its legislative ‘‘duties’’ once 
members have been elected is relatively 
brief. Article I, Section 5 provides that there 
must be ‘‘a Quorum to do business,’’ which 
the Constitution defines as constituting sim-
ply ‘‘a Majority’’ of each House. The same 
Section likewise specifies that each House 
must keep a ‘‘Journal of its Proceedings,’’ 
which must be published ‘‘from time to 
time,’’ and which may, if a sufficient number 
of members desire, reflect how every member 
voted ‘‘on any question.’’ The Constitution 
adds that neither House can adjourn for 
more than three days, or move the session to 
some other place, without the consent of the 
other House—a provision designed to prevent 
a single House from thwarting all congres-
sional action by simply absenting them-
selves indefinitely. 
There can be little question that the Fram-
ers imagined the legislature would do its 
work while assembled in some physical loca-
tion. In 1787 when the Constitution was 
drafted, they could scarcely have imagined 
any other functional way of proceeding. Var-
ious other constitutional provisions thus 
refer to Congress as ‘‘meeting’’ (Art. I, Sec. 
4) or ‘‘assembling’’ (Art. I, Sec. 3), and one 
even provides a mechanism by which mem-
bers can compel ‘‘the Attendance of absent 
Members,’’ (Art. I, Sec. 5) meaning presum-
ably those members not otherwise present 
where Congress is meeting. Of course, none 
of the clauses in which those terms appear 
address how Congress casts or counts its 
votes. Indeed, neither the document itself 
nor any Supreme Court decision defines what 
counts as ‘‘attendance’’ or ‘‘assembling,’’ 
much less how such ‘‘attendance’’ may be 
taken, or such ‘‘assemblage’’ may be accom-
plished. The Constitution equally contains 
no specific requirement of physical presence 
for Members to vote. What the Constitution 
does instead—as the courts have repeatedly 
recognized—is leave it up to each House of 
Congress to ‘‘determine the Rules of its Pro-
ceedings.’’ (Art. I, Sec. 5) As the Supreme 
Court explained in United States v. Ballin, 
144 U.S. 1 (1892), so long as there is a ‘‘reason-
able relation between the mode or method of 
proceeding established by the rule and the 
result which is sought to be attained,’’ the 
content of those rules are ‘‘beyond the chal-
lenge of any other body or tribunal.’’ 
Indeed, it is just such constitutional flexi-
bility that has enabled Congress to embrace 
the various informal solutions it has adopted 
over the years to ‘‘do business,’’ including 
relying on members to give ‘‘unanimous con-
sent’’ to a vote even if something less than 
an actual majority of members is physically 
present on the House floor. But while such 
well settled procedures are surely constitu-
tional, they may not always function to ad-
vance the system of majority rule the Con-
stitution so plainly contemplates. As we re-
cently saw when Congress enacted a substan-
tial stimulus bill just last month, it is pos-
sible for one House member, acting alone, to 
single-handedly defeat the manifest pref-
erence of the bipartisan majority by insist-
ing upon an actual demonstration that a ma-
jority of members were ‘‘present’’ (a term 
contained in House Rules, not in the Con-
stitution itself). This forced House leaders to 
make a choice the Constitution cannot be 
understood to compel—between surrendering 
the will of the majority to the demands of a 
single man, or insisting, as they did, that 
Members jeopardize their safety (and thus 
their ability to effectively represent their 
constituents going forward) by defying law-
ful public health restrictions to travel and 
meet in Washington, D.C. 
It is precisely in order to avoid such absurd 
results that Congress has embraced a variety 
of measures throughout its history to adjust 
to developing technologies and changing de-
mands. Thus, for example, current House 
Rules provide that in the event the existing 
electronic voting system is ‘‘inoperable,’’ the 
Speaker may direct the vote to be conducted 
through 
alternative 
methods, 
including 
through the use of ‘‘tellers’’ designated by 
the Speaker to ‘‘record the names of the 
Members voting on each side of the ques-
tion.’’ The teller system was an innovation 
put in place before the current electronic 
system was available, one among key re-
forms designed to strengthen Congress’ abil-
ity to maintain a public record of Members’

votes. The particular challenge of ensuring 
that Congress could continue to operate dur-
ing the outbreak of infectious disease was in-
deed the subject of one of Congress’s first ef-
forts to provide for alternative rules of oper-
ation. Following Congress’ return after the 
yellow fever epidemic that devastated the 
then-capital of Philadelphia in the summer 
of 1793, Congress adopted a law providing 
that in circumstances when ‘‘the prevalence 
of contagious sickness’’ made it ‘‘be haz-
ardous to the lives or health of the members 
to meet at the seat of Government,’’ the 
President could ‘‘convene Congress at such 
other place as he may judge proper.’’ If Con-
gress can delegate to the President the 
power to move congressional operations en-
tirely, surely it can reserve for itself the 
lesser power to make whatever far more 
modest amendment to process is required to 
ensure Congress is able to vote in the same, 
extraordinary circumstances. 
Finally, the temporary remote voting pro-
cedures as you have sketched them thus far 
appear to bear an entirely ‘‘reasonable rela-
tion’’ to the goal you aim to achieve, name-
ly, ensuring that Congress preserves the abil-
ity to vote in a way that maintains the insti-
tution’s representative character, protects 
the transparency of its operations, and fairly 
and accurately reflects the will of the Amer-
ican people. By keeping remote voting proce-
dures tied as closely as possible to the exist-
ing system, the proposed approach protects 
Members’ ability to participate in votes re-
gardless of geographic location, technical 
knowledge or means; minimizes the risk of 
foreign or other unlawful interference in the 
vote; and maximizes Congress’s ability to 
fairly reflect the will of the majority of the 
people even during the present crisis. The 
proposed approach contains essential safe-
guards to ensure that Members’ preferences 
are fully and accurately recorded; as you em-
phasized in your recent statement, Members 
designated to submit voting cards on behalf 
of other elected Representatives may only 
act pursuant to the direct, express instruc-
tion of the elected Representative, retaining 
no discretion in carrying out the ministerial 
function they play in the modified voting 
process. As ever, Members remain subject to 
all the disciplinary powers the House pos-
sesses to ensure the appropriate exercise of 
their duties. 
In short, with limited reforms that maxi-
mize Members’ ability to represent the wish-
es of their constituents, while minimizing 
disruption and confusion in House oper-
ations, Congress can succeed in preserving 
the essential constitutional function of the 
legislative branch even amidst an unprece-
dented pandemic. It is a critically important 
initiative in these extraordinary times. 
As ever, I thank you for your efforts, and 
for the opportunity to share my views. 
Sincerely, 
DEBORAH N. PEARLSTEIN, 
Professor of Law. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
about the process, let me just say, I 
hear from my friends. They like to talk 
about the 230 years of tradition as 
though the House has never made any 
changes to the way it operates in these 
last 230 years. That is just simply not 
true. So many of our most basic func-
tions have changed drastically since 
the first Congress, from the way we 
vote to the way we count a quorum. 
If a legislative body does not have 
the ability to respond to the challenges 
it faces, then how can it survive and 
how can it be functional? 
The challenge we are facing today is 
not permanent. I could argue that the 
House has made several more sweeping 
and permanent changes than this be-
fore. For one, the way we vote today 
looks nothing like how our prede-
cessors voted in 1789. Now we cast our 
votes in the Chamber by electronic de-
vice. 
Our predecessors recognized that the 
House needed to advance with tech-
nology. For decades, they called on the 
House to implement a more efficient 
and advanced voting system. They 
were afraid we would seem archaic 
compared to foreign and State govern-
ments. Does that sound familiar? 
Right now, we are watching as legis-
latures in our States take responsible 
action to respond to this pandemic by 
implementing remote voting proce-
dures and as parliaments around the 
world advance to meet this challenge 
head-on. What are we doing? We are 
struggling to even come up with an 
agreement that we need to do some-
thing—something. Anything. 
But voting electronically is not the 
only change we have made in response 
to technological advancements. Now, 
our floor proceedings are broadcast on 
C–SPAN. Members grappled with ques-
tions of how broadcasting the House 
would fundamentally change this body, 
but the desire for accountability and 
transparency won the day. 
Change is not always bad. And, of 
course, there were safeguards attached 
to this that preserved the integrity of 
the House: Proceedings cannot be tam-
pered with and cannot be used for po-
litical reasons and so on. 
Other changes we made over the 
years include the provisional quorum 
after 9/11. And that is not the only time 
we made changes to our quorum re-
quirements. 
Other changes were deciding when a 
quorum is required. For decades, Mem-
bers raised points of order that a 
quorum is not present during debates. 
The House has even expanded the 
Speaker’s ability to adjust the num-
bers of the whole House to account for 
those 
living, 
incapacitated, 
or 
re-
signed. 
How we count a quorum today is not 
the same as how we counted a quorum 
in the first Congress. We have made 
changes to our quorum rules as recent 
as 15 years ago. 
Here is the deal: What we are facing 
today doesn’t have to prevent us from 
legislating. We should not be afraid to 
adapt and respond to these challenges 
and to do so in a safe manner. If any-
thing, we have 230 years of precedent of 
us adapting to the changing world 
around us. There is nothing wrong with 
that. 
But we don’t have decades to make 
these changes. We need to make them 
now, because we are in the midst of a 
pandemic. Hopefully, we are seeing the 
end of it, but according to this admin-
istration’s own CDC, we may see a 
surge in COVID–19 cases in the fall. We 
may be in a more difficult situation. 
We need to be prepared. 
So no one is suggesting any perma-
nent rules changes here. Everything 
that we are putting forth is temporary 
and will be tied to the duration of this 
pandemic. Full stop. 
Let me just say this, finally. Proxy 
voting is constitutional. The experts 
have said so. We aren’t going to stop 
the work of the people’s House so that 
another branch of government can 
weigh in on our internal proceedings. 
I get it. My Republican friends have 
another agenda. They would prefer 
that we do not get work done during 
this difficult time. It is in, I think, 
their political interests, I guess they 
have decided, to slow the work down of 
Congress. 
Well, do you know what? The Amer-
ican people want us to work in times 
that are normal and in times like this 
when we are in the middle of a pan-
demic. And so I would urge my col-
leagues to reject the motion of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
and instead vote to get our work done. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1530 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I wanted to ask my 
chairman, when he was referencing Re-
publicans who just want to slow this 
place down and don’t want to get any 
work done, if he would except me and 
my colleague from Virginia from that 
characterization? Because I certainly 
know that it doesn’t apply, and I would 
like to know that my chairman knows 
that it doesn’t apply as well. 
When the chairman just stated that 
the reason that Republicans are op-
posed to proxy voting has nothing to do 
with—— 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me put it this way: I think there are 
certain Members of your conference 
who are interested in slowing the work 
of this democratic majority down. And 
I think that the constitutional argu-
ments are certainly on our side on this, 
and I think that there is another agen-
da, quite frankly, that is being pursued 
by some. I am not going to attribute 
that to you or anybody else. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman. 
Madam Speaker, if the constitutional 
arguments are so clear, we should be 
able to get this out of the district 
court in very short order, presump-
tively with the decision that my chair-
man would like. 
Madam Speaker, I want to ask my 
friend from Virginia again—what I 
have seen from Mr. GRIFFITH, Madam 
Speaker, is someone who has fought on 
behalf of the institution, not on behalf 
of Republicans, not on behalf of Demo-
crats. Without throwing my friend 
under the bus, he has been in the mi-
nority of my conference as often as he 
has been in the majority, fighting to do

the right thing because he thought we 
were on the wrong path. And he was 
saying: You know what? You may 
think this is politically expedient 
today, but you are going to regret this. 
And the decisions we make aren’t 
about politics, they are about people. 
They are about the institution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH). 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
would reiterate and thank the gen-
tleman for his kind comments. He is 
absolutely right. I come here today not 
as a Republican or a Democrat. I come 
here as an American, and I have no 
agenda today except to defend the Con-
stitution. 
And while the courts may ultimately 
determine that my friends on the other 
side of the aisle are right, I believe 
they are sorely wrong, Madam Speak-
er. Sorely wrong. Because we are not 
just talking about voting from afar, 
and while I would have problems with 
that as well, I will tell you it is more 
critical than that because the Con-
stitution calls on us to meet, to assem-
ble, and to have a quorum. 
The 
Founding 
Fathers 
debated 
whether or not that quorum should be 
a smaller-than-50-percent amount. And 
they determined that was not right be-
cause then it would tilt power into the 
hands of those that live closer to the 
Capitol, like Mr. BEYER, who appar-
ently is carrying at least nine proxies. 
It tilts powers into those people’s 
hands and away from the States that 
are further away, like Colorado and 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I would submit to 
you that there is a reason that in 231 
years this has never come up, even 
though they could have written a let-
ter. As I said before, they could have 
easily written a letter. They could 
have written a letter, and said: Hey, I 
can’t get there right now, give my vote 
to my friend. They didn’t do it. 
They could have said: Hey, for pur-
poses of a quorum, count me from afar 
by letter. They knew how to write. 
Messages were traded all the time. But, 
instead, they went to wherever the 
Capitol was at the time, whether it be 
in Philadelphia, whether it be in Wash-
ington, D.C., at a hotel, and they did 
the people’s business. They did not 
cede that authority to anyone else. 
They kept it for themselves. And that 
is what the Constitution calls for. And 
you know what, as I said before, they 
never did it. They never thought they 
should. They never thought they could. 
Madam Speaker, I have to tell you, 
we go all the way back to the Declara-
tion of Independence, and Caesar Rod-
ney got on his horse while deathly ill 
with cancer, suffering from asthma and 
the gout, to ride to Philadelphia to 
cast the deciding vote for his State of 
Delaware because he needed to be there 
live in order to do it. He needed to be 
at the Capitol. He needed to be at the 
meeting place of this country, even in 
its infancy, to cast the vote, no matter 
what. And he rode through a storm. 
And so we continue to have the pol-
icy—because it was the Founding Fa-
thers’ wish, and because it is the right 
thing to do—that if you are going to 
count as a quorum, you meet in the 
Capitol. You may designate a different 
place for that Capitol. We might des-
ignate it in Colorado, if need be. 
But wherever the Capitol is des-
ignated, this body must come together, 
representing the people from the var-
ious States of this Union. And, we, 
each individual, shall cast our vote, 
not 10 votes here by one and 8 votes 
there by another, but one by one, each 
district as determined in the decennial 
census shall cast their vote on each 
and every measure. When we don’t do 
that, we don’t do our job. When we 
don’t do our job, we cast a doubt on 
every action we take. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I don’t even know what the heck 
the gentleman from Virginia is talking 
about. We debated this. Nobody is 
ceding their power to anybody here. We 
had this debate. Read the resolution. 
Members who cannot be here are very 
much engaged and are directing their 
wishes very directly, like they would 
by casting the vote here. So I don’t 
even know what the heck we are talk-
ing about here, but I guess it is a good 
talking point on their side, but it just 
doesn’t reflect reality. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), the distinguished Speaker of 
the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
thank him for his leadership of the 
Rules Committee and for bringing us 
together so that we can present this 
FISA bill on the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, when we come to 
Congress, we all take an oath of office. 
We raise our right hand to protect and 
defend the Constitution of the United 
States. Protecting that, we are pro-
tecting the American people. 
Central to that defense is how we do 
protect and defend, it is about our val-
ues, which are part of our strength. It 
is about the health, education, and 
well-being of our people, our children, 
our future, which is part of our 
strength. Our military might is part of 
our strength. And our intelligence is 
very much a part of our strength in 
order to provide force protection for 
our men and women in uniform when 
they go out there to protect and defend 
our country. Force protection. 
When I first started on the Intel-
ligence Committee in the early mid- 
90s, a long time ago, I would soon then 
rise to be the ranking member, and I 
take great pride in that ex officio all 
these years since then. When I started 
way back when, it was about force pro-
tection; intelligence to protect our 
forces to anticipate any initiation of 
hostilities, and also, when engaged, to 
have the intelligence to protect them. 
Since then, the whole world has 
changed with technology, and all the 
rest, in that period of time. So our in-
telligence has had to change as well. 
And one of the ways it has, has neces-
sitated us having a FISA bill, the USA 
FREEDOM Reauthorization Act. 
In the House some weeks ago we 
passed a bill, honchoed by our two dis-
tinguished chairs, the chair of the Ju-
diciary Committee, Mr. NADLER from 
New York; and the chair of the Intel-
ligence Committee, Mr. SCHIFF from 
California, two committees of jurisdic-
tion. It had strong bipartisan support. 
It went over to the Senate. In my view, 
it was vastly improved in the Senate, 
and it had 80 votes. 
Our bill was bipartisan. Their bill 
was bipartisan, too: 80 votes in the 
United States Senate for the Senate 
bill, which was amended by the Leahy/ 
Lee Amendment—very, very protective 
of the balance that we have to have be-
tween security and privacy, security 
and civil liberties. This is the balance 
that we have to strike. 
In my years on Intelligence, I was fo-
cused a lot on the civil liberties part of 
it, establishing a board, et cetera, to 
ensure that whatever we did, that bal-
ance with our civil liberties was cen-
tral and important to it. 
As Benjamin Franklin said: Security 
and liberties, you can’t have one with-
out the other. They go together, secu-
rity and liberty. 
And so now today, this Rules Com-
mittee is presenting that bill, the USA 
FREEDOM Reauthorization Act com-
ing back from the Senate. Again, our 
bill in the House originally was 278 to 
136. It was strongly bipartisan, with 126 
Republicans voting for it. This bill 
coming back from the Senate, as I said, 
had 80 votes over there. 
So with an intelligence bill, with a 
FISA bill, nobody is ever really that 
happy. I never was. And you always 
want more or less, as the case may be, 
but the fact is—and I say this in all hu-
mility, because I don’t pretend to know 
more than my colleagues—but in all 
humility, we have to have a bill. If we 
don’t have a bill, then our liberties, our 
civil liberties are less protected. 
Some people say: I don’t care, just let 
them extend this and extend that. No. 
There is real value in both the House 
bill that we passed and then exception-
ally so in what the Senate passed. 
There are those that would not like us 
to have a bill. Some of them in the ju-
diciary, the Department of Justice, 
just say: Don’t have a bill, just give us 
all the leeway in the world not to have 
to protect any liberties. But we can’t 
have that. 
We take an oath to protect and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States and all the liberties contained 
therein as we protect the American 
people. 
So if anybody thinks, well, no, in 
order to have a bill, we have to have a 
rule. So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for 
bringing this rule to the floor, which 
enables us to pass a bill. This legisla-
tion increases the power of the Privacy

and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to 
pursue its mission to protect Ameri-
cans’ privacy. 
After 9/11 this Congress considered 
the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism 
Prevention Act of 2004, establishing the 
Privacy and Civil Liberties Board. 
That was one of my top priorities all 
those years ago. And the Board has 
done critical work in assessing the pri-
vacy and civil liberties impact of the 
government’s collection activities, in-
cluding under various provisions of the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
So, again, this has to be a high pri-
ority for us. It was a higher priority in 
the act that was passed that could get 
passed in the Senate. 
So, again, I am going to submit my 
statement for the RECORD that I talk 
about here. But FISA is a critical pil-
lar of America’s national security, 
which Congress has updated and im-
proved over the last years to ensure 
that America’s privacies and civil lib-
erties are expected. 
Are we ever satisfied? Of course not. 
Of course not. But legislation is just 
exactly that. Legislation. Our attempt 
to come together to protect and defend 
in a way that has already passed the 
Senate can go directly to the President 
for his signature, and I hope that that 
will be the case today. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman again for bringing this rule to 
the floor. I urge all of our colleagues to 
vote for this important rule that en-
ables us to do important things for the 
American people. With that, I urge an 
‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the 
USA 
FREEDOM 
Reauthorization 
Act, 
a 
strong, bipartisan bill to reauthorize critical 
FISA provisions. 
In March, our Members worked day and 
night to craft legislation that strikes a strong, 
careful balance between security and privacy. 
We thank Chairman NADLER and Chairman 
SCHIFF for their leadership and the expertise 
they bring on this vital national security issue. 
We were proud to have passed that bill on 
an overwhelmingly bipartisan 278–136 basis, 
including with the support of 126 of our Re-
publican colleagues. 
Last week, the Senate considered the 
House-passed FISA bill and amended it to fur-
ther expand the robust amicus curiae provi-
sions in the original House bill. The bill then 
passed also on an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
basis, 80–16, supported by nearly every Re-
publican Senator. 
Yet, now, some Members on the other side 
of the aisle are considering changing their 
minds and flipping their position, in order to 
score political points with the President. 
As should be clear, political gamesmanship 
has no place in our national security. Reau-
thorizing FISA—and doing so in a timely man-
ner—is a matter of keeping the American peo-
ple safe. 
Indeed, FISA is a critical pillar of America’s 
national security, which Congress has updated 
and improved over the years to ensure that 
Americans’ privacy and civil liberties are re-
spected. 
After 9/11, as revelations emerged that the 
Bush Administration had engaged in warrant- 
less electronic surveillance of the public, Con-
gress strengthened and updated the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
Our action helped end this unacceptable 
practice and ensure that all electronic surveil-
lance of Americans complies with the law. 
Since then, the law has been further up-
dated, including through the FISA Amend-
ments Act of 2008 and the USA FREEDOM 
ACT of 2015. 
The bill that the House passed in March 
took additional steps to strengthen FISA, 
which are preserved in the Senate-amended 
bill: placing new limitations on surveillance au-
thorities while ensuring that our intelligence 
and law enforcement have the tools necessary 
to keep Americans safe; ending the NSA’s call 
detail records initiative, which the government 
has confirmed that it no longer uses; strength-
ening the integrity of the FISA process by in-
creasing transparency and accountability; and 
expanding involvement of the court-appointed 
amicus curiae in FISA cases—which was ex-
panded in the Senate bill. 
We are proud that this legislation increases 
the power of the Privacy and Civil Liberties 
Oversight Board (PCLOB) to pursue its mis-
sion to protect Americans’ privacy. 
After 9/11, as Congress considered the In-
telligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention 
Act of 2004, establishing the Privacy and Civil 
Liberties Oversight Board was one of my top 
priorities. 
The Board has done critical work in assess-
ing the privacy and civil liberties impact of the 
government’s collection activities, including 
under various provisions of the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act. 
As Members of Congress, we take an oath 
to support and defend the Constitution, and to 
protect the American people. 
This legislation honors that oath, as it also 
honors the patriotic contributions of the men 
and women of the intelligence and law en-
forcement communities and the privacy of the 
American people. 
I urge Members to remember their oath and 
to once again support this critical legislation to 
keep the American people safe. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
Speaker for her words. We do come to 
a place where we sometimes are satis-
fied. In this case we had a bipartisan 
group that was continuing to work to 
do even more of those good things that 
the gentlewoman laid out. 
They had an amendment that they 
had drafted together in a bipartisan 
way. That amendment was not made in 
order on this floor. I agree with the 
gentlewoman, we should never be satis-
fied. In this case, we have decided to be 
satisfied with the Senate language in-
stead of trying to improve it with the 
House work product, and I deeply re-
gret that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY.) 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the opportunity here to visit 
about what we are dealing with today 
with respect to proxy voting with re-
spect to the previous question. And I 
notice that the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts—and, first of all, and our 
prayers go out for the tragedy that you 
are dealing with in Massachusetts, at a 
significant clip worse than we are in 
Texas, obviously, regionally very dif-
ficult. 
But what we are trying to deal with 
here right now is trying to protect the 
Constitution of the United States. And 
this is not something that is about 
slowing down the work of this body. I 
am delighted to work with my col-
league, DEAN PHILLIPS from Minnesota. 
Right now, together, we are all work-
ing on legislation to try to improve the 
PPP, and I am delighted to do that as 
the cosponsor of that legislation. I am 
not here to slow down what we need to 
be doing to help work for the people of 
the United States, I can assure you. 
I am here because the Constitution 
matters. In the various staff reports 
that talked about the options for us to 
deal with this, I would remind you that 
our Democratic colleagues acknowl-
edge the constitutional questions that 
arise from proxy voting. 
b 1545 
Let’s be clear to the American people 
that we are not talking about remote 
voting. I, too, like the gentleman from 
Virginia, have very serious constitu-
tional reservations about remote vot-
ing, but let’s have that debate. Let’s 
have a thorough debate about that. But 
we are talking about proxy voting. 
For those people who are watching 
this back at home, understand what 
that means. That means that a Mem-
ber of this body who has been delegated 
to them the responsibility from their 
constituents to vote for them, to argue 
for them, to be on this body rep-
resenting them, is taking that solemn 
duty and handing it to another, and in 
some cases, 5 or 10 Members handing it 
to another. 
That undermines our body. It dilutes 
the representation of our constituent. 
It dilutes those of us as Members and 
the power and importance that is en-
trusted to us to represent our constitu-
ents. 
This is what is at stake, and this is 
what we are talking about, and this is 
why we have filed litigation. 
I would rather that we address this in 
this body, but in talking to the Parlia-
mentarian, I was advised there was 
nothing we could do, that when the 
House voted 10, 12 days ago—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I was ad-
vised that we could do nothing in this 
body to address the constitutional in-
firmity of literally transferring our 
constitutionally vested authority to 
represent our constituents to another. 
Therefore, I was told, and I believe that 
is the case, we have to go to the courts, 
the Article III courts, to express our 
concern that this is constitutionally 
infirm. 
This is not about setting our own 
rules. This is about directly opposing

May 27, 2020 
the structure of the Constitution in 
which we represent our constituents. 
Keep in mind that at the time of our 
founding in 1793, in the heat of yellow 
fever, 5,000 Philadelphians died out of a 
population of 50,000. That is 10 percent. 
That would be 180,000 or 160,000 today. 
Yet, what happened? James Madison, 
George Washington, and Thomas Jef-
ferson were all working to figure out 
how this body could continue to meet 
in person. They didn’t adopt proxy vot-
ing. They figured out how to work to 
meet. 
There is a letter sent from James 
Madison to George Washington on Oc-
tober 24, 1793, talking about this very 
issue, that in a pandemic, this body 
should meet. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has again ex-
pired. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, this body 
should continue to meet. That letter 
from James Madison, the father of the 
Constitution, to the father of our coun-
try, George Washington, expressly lays 
out what he is talking about to try to 
protect our duty to meet as a body, the 
requirement of physical presence, the 
requirement that we meet together, to 
look each other in the eye to do our 
duty to represent our constituents. 
This is not about slowing down the 
work of this body. This is about doing 
our duty to uphold the Constitution 
and finding a way to navigate through 
the difficulties of the current moment. 
We got through yellow fever. We got 
through world wars. We got through 
the Spanish flu. We got through a Civil 
War. And we managed to figure out 
how to do our job. Our Founders got 
through smallpox. I would implore my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, let us not adopt this proxy voting 
in which we turn over our solemn duty 
to another Member. Let us work to-
gether to find out how to get through 
this in a way that respects the Con-
stitution. That is why we are here. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Nobody is turning over their solemn 
duty to another Member of Congress, 
and if my friend would read the pro-
posal which passed the House, if he had 
paid attention to the debate that we 
had, he wouldn’t be mischaracterizing 
what, in fact, we are doing here. 
Nobody is turning over their solemn 
power to anybody. Members have to 
participate directly just like they 
would on the House floor. They have to 
pay attention to the proceedings. They 
cannot give their votes in advance. On 
a previous question, people have to re-
spond just like they would in real time 
as if they were here on the floor. 
So, this is just not true. It is not ac-
curate. 
Again, we have had this debate. The 
House has spoken, and we are moving 
forward with remote voting by proxy 
today. 
By the way, we didn’t get through 
the pandemic of 1918 in the way the 
gentleman just kind of characterized. 
In fact, that was an example of why we 
need to do something because, during 
that time, we weren’t meeting. During 
that time, a bill actually to try to get 
more doctors to rural areas to help 
people get through it couldn’t get 
passed in the House, and a lot of people 
died as a result of it. 
So, I don’t look at the Spanish flu of 
1918 as somehow a model that we ought 
to employ now. That is an example of 
how this institution failed, and people 
died as a result of it. 
We are now in another pandemic. 
Hopefully, this is short-lived. Hope-
fully, the President is right that, to-
morrow, everything will be perfect. But 
we are also being told that, actually, 
things could get worse in the fall. That 
is what happened during the Spanish 
flu, by the way. The fall was worse. 
We need to be prepared, and that is 
what we are going to do. We are going 
to do the people’s business, and the 
people who can get here, they can get 
here. If they can’t, for whatever rea-
son, because flights have been canceled 
because they are living in areas where 
there has been a terrible surge in 
COVID–19, we will adjust accordingly. 
Again, this is temporary, and it is 
not meant to displace the way we do 
business here on a regular basis, and it 
is 
totally 
constitutional. 
Constitu-
tional 
scholar 
after 
constitutional 
scholar has validated that, so I would 
say to the gentleman that I reject the 
way he has characterized what we have 
done here because it is just not accu-
rate. It is not accurate. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), the majority leader of this 
House. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Massachu-
setts for yielding. 
I am going to argue, and I want to 
talk about this rule and the bill to 
which it applies, but I will take a 
minute, not much more, perhaps a lit-
tle more than that, to talk about what 
apparently the Republicans want to 
talk about: proxy voting. 
I will tell my friend that not a single 
one of my constituents, not one, voted 
for me so I would vote in this machine. 
Not one. Not one of them voted for me 
to vote in that machine. What they 
want me to do is vote to represent 
them, and they really didn’t care how I 
did that as long as it was accurate. 
Very frankly, I think that side of the 
aisle is promoting form over substance. 
Of course, the gentleman mentioned 
Philadelphia, September 1787, the mir-
acle at Philadelphia. You remember 
the debate as Member after Member 
got up and said we cannot use Teams; 
we cannot use our cell phones; we can-
not use Webex. Remember that debate? 
They said you can’t use any of that, 
and you certainly can’t use a rotary 
telephone. You heard them say that. 
You can’t do that. You need to be in 
this room. Well, that room was in 
Philadelphia. Or you needed to be in 
this room. Well, that room is in New 
York. 
My friends, you have magnified form 
over substance. Our constituents voted 
for us to vote their interests, and there 
are many ways we can do that. 
They had not the technology. That is 
why they couldn’t schedule a vote in 48 
hours, because the horses did not fly. 
Form over substance. 
You don’t want us to meet. And the 
man who would be king does not want 
us to meet. I get that. Because you do 
not like the substance, whether it is 
the Affordable Care Act, whether it is 
trying to help renters and mortgage 
people, whether it is trying to help peo-
ple in line. I get it. You don’t want us 
to meet. 
But we have an obligation and a duty 
to the American people to do so, to 
make sure that the man who would be 
king is not king because our Constitu-
tion, the people who met in that Phila-
delphia room, they had had enough of 
kings. They wanted to have people who 
would represent them. And they didn’t 
care whether they voted on this ma-
chine, that machine, that machine, or, 
very frankly, as you are sitting in the 
aisle and you can’t get by and you ask 
your friend: ‘‘Put it in the slot for me, 
will you?’’ 
I am not going to ask you to raise 
your hand if you have ever done that. 
But that was virtual voting. But it re-
flected 
your 
view, 
my 
view, 
rep-
resenting my constituents and your 
constituents. 
Now, let me speak about this rule 
and this bill because I am appalled, 
chagrined, disappointed at what is hap-
pening. We worked very hard to deal 
with a very difficult subject, Mr. BLUNT 
and I from the House and Senator Bond 
and Senator Rockefeller. Ms. PELOSI 
was the Speaker of the House, and I 
was the majority leader of the House. 
It was 2008, and we were trying to deal 
with 
extending 
the 
Foreign 
Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act to keep our 
people and our country safe. 
Probably not very many of us on this 
floor know more about the Intelligence 
Committee than our Speaker. She is 
the longest serving member of the In-
telligence Committee ever. 
Mr. NUNES and Mr. SCHIFF, they work 
together. Mr. NADLER and his ranking 
member work together. Just about 21⁄2 
months ago, we came to this floor, and 
we were all present. I don’t mean we 
had 100 percent of membership, but we 
were mostly present. We debated that 
bill, and we voted on that bill. 
We did what the American people so 
pined for us doing. We voted together 
as Americans; 67.7 percent of the Re-
publicans voted aye, and 66.9 percent of 
the Democrats voted aye. And America 
said amen. That is what they want us 
to do, reason together and do for the 
American people and our country what 
is best for our people and our country. 
We sent that bill to the United 
States Senate; 126 Republicans and 152

May 27, 2020 
Democrats voting together. Two-thirds 
of the House sent that bill to the 
United States Senate. 
I talked to Mr. SCHIFF and I talked to 
Mr. NADLER, and they said this House 
bill has the support of the United 
States Senate. I talked to leaders—I 
won’t name them—in the United States 
Senate who were surprised that the 
Senate did not pass the House bill but 
sent an extension because they didn’t 
really vote on the House bill. They sent 
it after we had left. We didn’t pass 
that, and the Intelligence Committee 
made do. 
So, the Senate did, in fact, take up 
the bill. What did they do? Two people 
who spoke, Mr. BURGESS
and Mr. 
WOODALL, who voted with the major-
ity, with the two-thirds of Republicans 
who said this is a good bill, this is a 
good bill for our country, for America’s 
security, and America’s safety—as did 
Mr. MCCARTHY; as did Mr. SCALISE; as 
did Mr. THORNBERRY, the ranking mem-
ber of the Armed Services Committee; 
as did Mr. ROGERS, the ranking mem-
ber on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee; as did Ms. CHENEY, your Con-
ference chair; as did Mr. COLE, the 
ranking member of the Rules Com-
mittee; and 120 other Republicans. 
b 1600 
Now, there were, of course, as is not 
surprising, differences. This is, as the 
Speaker said, a very controversial bill. 
It is always a controversial bill. 
My friend, Mr. MCGOVERN, and I, who 
vote together most of the time, are 
going to vote differently on this bill. I 
am going to vote for it. He believes 
there are not enough protections in 
here. But there are more protections in 
here than when those named voted for 
it and 80 Members of the United States 
Senate voted for it, including 48 Repub-
licans. 
Now, what was different when they 
voted on it and 48 Republicans in the 
United States Senate voted for it? 
There had not been a snap of the fin-
gers, ‘‘Vote ‘no’ ’’; not an order from on 
high, ‘‘Vote ‘no’ ’’; not a President who 
has been beating the drum and, frank-
ly, his supporters have been beating 
the drum that somehow the law en-
forcement community—the FBI, the 
CIA, the other this and that and the 
other law enforcement agencies—broke 
the Constitution. 
This President shows less respect for 
law enforcement than any President I 
have seen at the Federal level. So he 
said, ‘‘Vote ‘no.’ ’’ 
My friend with whom I work, the ma-
jority leader, called me the other night 
and said: You ought to pull the bill— 
the minority leader. 
You know why I do that? Because we 
were all in the majority when we 
passed this bill. It wasn’t a majority- 
minority bill; it was an American bill. 
My friend, the minority leader, said: 
Pull this bill. 
Now, I won’t go into the rest of the 
conversation because we have private 
conversations about where we are 
going to go and what we need to do. 
The only thing that has changed, 
Madam Speaker, is that Donald Trump 
has said ‘‘Vote ‘no’ ’’ to 126 people who 
voted with 152 Democrats for America. 
By the way, the people who are vot-
ing ‘‘no’’ also voted for America. They 
voted for civil liberties, which we 
honor. 
We can respect every person who 
voted because they voted out of convic-
tion, not out of party loyalty, not out 
of a ‘‘Yes, sir.’’ They voted their con-
science, they voted their conviction. 
I wish this Chamber were full, but we 
have to be distanced. I hope some of 
my colleagues are listening on both 
sides of the aisle. 
This bill is like every bill, not per-
fect, but as the Speaker said, it must 
pass. Why? To protect America. 
We need to continue to keep making 
it better. My friend from Massachu-
setts will make sure that we focus on 
that, and I honor him for it. 
So I ask my friends: Vote your con-
victions. Remember how critical you 
were of a candidate for President who 
said, ‘‘I first voted for it and then I 
voted against it,’’ how critical you 
were. But your flailing around to find a 
rationalization for your change of vote 
is sad. 
Madam Speaker, vote ‘‘yes’’ on the 
rule and on the bill. Vote for your 
country. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. WOODALL. I thank you for that 
admonition, Madam Chair. 
Madam Speaker, there is only one 
person on our side of the aisle who can 
clear up all of that confusion in 1 
minute. I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCAR-
THY), our leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the majority leader for his com-
ments. It reminds me of the days when 
I was the majority leader and he was 
minority whip and we used to be able 
to have colloquies. I yearn for those 
days again. 
But let me respond to much of what 
the majority leader has said. I respect 
the gentleman greatly, but I just think 
he is wrong. 
When I walked in the room, the gen-
tleman said we did not want to meet. 
He knows that is not true. 
Simply look at the board today, how 
many Republicans are here and how 
many Democrats. We will give the gen-
tleman an easy answer to that question 
of who wants to meet. 
Or why not look to simply a month 
ago. Only one side put a plan out of 
how to bring Congress back. 
We don’t have a schedule. We don’t 
know when we are supposed to come. 
One day they say ‘‘yes,’’ the next day 
they say ‘‘no.’’ 
I think it is very clear which side 
wants to meet. It is very clear, and 
based upon 231 years of history. 
For those Members not in the Cham-
ber and sitting in their office watching 
on television, they ought to pay atten-
tion to this very next vote. They are 
going to do something that no Member 
has ever been allowed to do before. 
They are going to change history, but 
not for the better. 
While millions of Americans are 
going to be tuned in to their television 
to watch us put people in space, we are 
going to watch more than 70 Members 
on the Democrat side stay home and 
say they could not make it, but they 
still want a paycheck. 
We just listened to the majority lead-
er question the Republicans on whether 
they want to meet. 
I watch my home State of California. 
Now we get to go to church, now we 
can get our hair cut today, but in Con-
gress, what do we get? We get no ac-
countability. 
You see, the one thing the majority 
leader said that is true is that people 
vote for us. Yes, they do. They vote for 
us, expecting us to vote for them. They 
do not expect us to give that vote to 
somebody from another State. 
Our Constitution, our country ex-
pects us to convene, just as history has 
shown every time before in any crisis 
we have. 
I heard the majority leader question, 
not going through the Speaker, but one 
of our own Members on a speech that 
he gave just a few minutes before, Con-
gressman CHIP ROY, about whether he 
wanted to meet. Well, let’s look at 
some facts. 
We are called back here to vote on a 
bill authored by CHIP ROY, the Con-
gressman, to help small businesses, but 
his name will no longer be on it. The 
only reason we are going to get a vote 
on it is because the Speaker had to 
pledge to somebody to vote for the $3 
trillion bill that we would vote on. 
Once we found out everybody loved 
the bill, lo and behold, we can’t let a 
Republican have their name on the bill, 
so we have changed the bill number. 
We didn’t change the bill, but took his 
name off of it. He is no longer the main 
author of the bill, even though it was 
his idea. It is something the Members 
can be proud of on the other side. They 
played politics well that day. 
CHIP ROY will tell me, though, he 
doesn’t care who gets the credit; he 
just wants to help small businesses. 
I look forward to seeing the Member 
who took his name try to campaign on 
that. That is a lot of character on the 
other side, by far. I hope they are 
proud of that, because I don’t think 
anybody in the country is. 
Now, let’s just look at some facts. 
I respect the chairman of the Rules 
Committee. I read his reports. Even in 
April, he wrote a report about proxy 
voting, and he questioned the constitu-
tionality of it. I don’t know if the Con-
stitution changed between then and 
now, but I don’t believe it has. 
Let’s look at exactly the facts of 
what we have. 
Now, I think many Members will say 
in their own States that things are get-
ting better. I know in my home State, 
we can go to church; yes, we can get

our hair cut; restaurants are opening 
up. But 2 weeks ago, people would prob-
ably argue it was a little worse. 
At that time, only 12 Democrats 
couldn’t make it here to vote for their 
$3 trillion bill. Now there are more 
than 70 who are supposedly signing 
something to say they physically can’t 
make it here now. I wonder if any of 
them are having a fundraiser today. 
Let’s go through the facts. 
The Constitution requires in-person 
assembly. 
If we hang our hat on the notion that 
the House can make their own rules, 
then why don’t we make a rule that 
Republicans can’t vote? Why don’t we 
make a rule that women can’t vote? We 
can make the rules, but we can’t make 
unconstitutional rules. 
The Constitution deals with this and 
tells us we should assemble. Yes, that 
is why, on August 14, after this build-
ing burned in 1812, the War of 1812–1814, 
they still convened. It wasn’t here, but 
it was in a hotel. 
Some might think, oh, modern his-
tory allows us to do this. Well, do you 
know what modern history allows peo-
ple to do? If the Member can’t vote on 
the proxy, this rule allows the staff to 
do it. That is literally what the rule 
says. 
If the other side doesn’t have it, I 
will put it in the RECORD right here. I 
will underline it, and I will provide it 
to the other side. If they want to read 
it out loud, they are more than wel-
come. 
If a Member cannot provide electronically, 
a staff is allowed to put the vote across. 
That is what is written. That is what 
was passed. 
Even one proxy vote dilutes the vot-
ing power of every Member. 
We have an unbelievable country. 
The people lend their power and voice 
to Members of Congress, be it a Con-
gresswoman or Congressman, and they 
hold us accountable every 2 years. 
We are going to have people on this 
floor voting for more than five Mem-
bers from five different States. 
In California alone, the largest dele-
gation, more than half of the Demo-
crats stayed home. I will guarantee 
they all cashed their check this month. 
That means 19 million people in Cali-
fornia will not have their voice heard. 
Maybe somebody from Connecticut will 
vote for them. 
More than 70 Members will vote by 
proxy. That is 49 million Americans 
who did not count because we gave it 
to somebody else. The other side 
should be proud of that. 
Proxy votes have never been allowed 
to count towards a quorum, but what 
are we going to do on this rule? There 
will be more bodies voting ‘‘no’’ than 
voting ‘‘yes,’’ but the other side is 
going to win because they have got a 
vote in the pocket. 
The Democrat plan permits a staffer 
to vote by proxy on behalf of a Member 
who is unavailable. That is totally 
true. It is in the rules right here, and I 
will provide it to the other side. Let me 
read it into the RECORD since they have 
a hard time reading: 
If a Member is unavailable to email or send 
a text message, a staff member may trans-
mit the instructions at the direction of the 
Member. 
Is that a staff member? Does that say 
anywhere in there that only a Member 
can vote? 
I have not yielded my time, but I 
have read these words. 
A Member can vote by proxy while 
attending a political fundraiser under 
this plan. A Member could be at a fund-
raiser watching on television and say: 
Well, let me pause for one moment. I 
didn’t want to go back to D.C., even 
though you asked me to, but I need to 
put my vote in. It is okay. I will get 
somebody from another State to do it. 
The McGovern regulations state that 
Members can only vote using proxy 
voting if they are physically unable to 
make it to the Capitol. 
I don’t know what happened in the 
last 2 weeks when only 12 could not 
make it, but now there are more than 
70. I am concerned for them. It must be 
something very serious. 
All Members had nearly 2 weeks’ no-
tice ahead for this vote; 2 weeks we had 
to plan. 
For 231 years, Members found a way 
to get to D.C. 
If this rule or bill passes, it will only 
be because of proxy votes that will 
make up the difference. 
So my friend over there thinks some-
one is going to vote differently. Yeah, 
they are. 
Even on the Senate side, they have 
told us: Whatever you are passing here 
under these rules is not constitutional. 
If we can make this type of rule, we 
could make anything: People with 
glasses can’t vote—unheard of. 
b 1615 
Yes, we raised a lawsuit. Yes, we be-
lieve in a previous question, that peo-
ple should vote ‘‘no’’ on this. 
It is a violation of the Constitution. 
It is a dereliction of the duty of elected 
officials. It will silence the voice of 
people, the same constituents that you 
took the oath to represent. 
I think of all the things this country 
had challenges with. Never did this 
body not find it was essential to meet. 
Never did they question to change the 
rule to empower one over another. But 
they have done just that. They have 
done just that. 
If you are a Member of Congress, if 
you are home, sitting there because 
you cannot make it, and you think you 
are going to send your message to your 
staffer to send it in, you might want to 
change because maybe McGovern will 
change the rules now. 
When you were sworn in, you held up 
your hand to uphold the Constitution. 
This is your moment. This is your 
time. Read Article I, Section 4, Section 
5, and Section 6. We even compel peo-
ple to go gather you to bring you to 
these Chambers. 
What is interesting to me is that the 
other side is willing to endanger our 
Constitution just to empower more 
power to the majority itself. 
It will be interesting to see those 
who go back to their constituents and 
say, I will represent you because I can 
just phone it in. I deserve to be re-
elected because I passed us off to an-
other Member to vote for you. 
It is interesting to find that maybe 
when you raised your hand, maybe 
when you thought the Constitution 
changed, it hasn’t. 
So, yes, just as the majority leader 
said, he wants you to look into your 
heart to how you are going to vote. Do 
that. 
I hope we all come back to this floor 
and we all look up. I am not sure how 
the vote will go. Will you have a little 
P by the name that says a proxy? 
Will we be able to tell by proxy that 
somebody from another State voted for 
you so the rest of the country can see? 
How will you tell the country today 
that is opening up more, that is send-
ing astronauts to space, that you want 
to close Congress further, and you want 
to deny their voice one last time? 
This is not about opening a campus. 
This is about restoring the voice to the 
American public that we have done for 
231 years. And for you to ever question 
who wants to meet, let the public just 
see the scoreboard at the end of the 
day. 
I think it is easy to answer that ques-
tion, not by voice, but simply by your 
feet, who is willing to show and who is 
willing to work for them. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Accord-
ing to the rules, Members shall address 
their remarks to the Chair, and the 
Chair will strongly admonish all Mem-
bers to do so. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I have been here for a while now, and 
I have never quite heard anything like 
that; 
I 
mean, 
blatant 
mischarac-
terization of what the facts are. 
The gentleman suggested, not once, 
but several times, that the rules allow 
staff members to vote for other Mem-
bers in this Chamber. That is just not 
true. I mean, no matter how you want 
to look at it, it is just not true. But the 
gentleman repeated that falsehood over 
and over and over and over again. 
I asked him to yield so I could read 
the end of the sentence that he didn’t 
want to finish, which is: ‘‘And that 
Member must confirm the instruction 
by telephone to the Member serving as 
proxy before the vote may be cast on 
their behalf.’’ 
The gentleman knows that that is 
not true but, yet, here he comes to the 
floor and he repeats over and over 
again something that, in the written 
instructions, in the guidelines that he 
was referring to, says the opposite. 
I mean, are things that broken here 
that we cannot even agree on the basic 
facts? 
I get it. You don’t like what we are 
doing here, that’s fine. But let’s not

misinterpret and twist and distort 
what we are trying to do here. 
Yeah, the gentleman had a plan. We 
actually delayed moving forward on 
trying to change the rules to operate 
remotely because the gentleman said 
that he was willing to work with us to 
try to figure out whether we could 
come to some sort of accommodation. 
And you know what his plan was? His 
plan was we all come back, and all the 
Members 
in 
this 
Chamber 
get 
prioritized, over all of our constitu-
ents, and we get tested every time we 
come back, so that we can operate here 
safely. 
So my doctors, and my nurses, and 
my first responders, and those who 
work in our grocery stores, and those 
who work in homeless shelters and in 
food pantries, who can’t get tested, we 
are all so special, according to the mi-
nority 
leader, 
that 
we 
should 
be 
prioritized and go to the top of the list. 
And that was part of his plan. 
Forget about it. I don’t know about 
your constituents, but my constituents 
would find that totally unacceptable, 
and it represents a tone-deafness that I 
haven’t heard in a long time here. 
When he talks about no account-
ability in this process, I don’t even 
know what the hell he is talking about, 
I really don’t. 
And again, the idea that somehow 
staff could vote for Members? That is 
absolutely not true. Absolutely not 
true. 
I don’t even know how to respond to 
what the gentleman just said. It makes 
you understand why so many people 
are cynical when they look at this 
Chamber and they see the exchanges 
that go on here. 
I get it; we have disagreements on 
issues. 
We 
have 
disagreements 
on 
whether we should move forward on 
with FISA or not. I have disagreements 
with my own leadership on that. Those 
are honest disagreements, but they are 
based on conviction. They are based on 
fact. 
You can disagree with whether or not 
we should be able to operate remotely 
during 
extraordinary 
times 
like 
pandemics. I get it. We can argue about 
the constitutionality. I think we are on 
strong constitutional grounds. You can 
argue the opposite point of view. 
But to makes things up, to come 
down here just to twist what we have 
done here, it is just unacceptable. It is 
unacceptable. We all ought to be better 
than that. 
We are trying to figure out a way to 
operate during a very difficult time in 
our country where, probably today, 
over 100,000 people will have lost their 
lives. 
And notwithstanding the President 
of the United States trying to down-
play that and say, no big deal, you 
know, it is not much of anything. 
It is a big deal. I have lost valued 
members of my community to this dis-
ease, and I know you have as well. 
So we are trying to get through this 
and, hopefully, this is short-lived and, 
hopefully, we can get back to business 
as normal as quickly as possible. But if 
this comes back in the fall, we need to 
be prepared. 
So, under this proposal, if you want 
to be here you can come here and we 
can operate in person. But as we are all 
finding out, that is difficult, even in 
committee hearings. 
The Rules Committee is the smallest 
committee in the House, and we can’t 
even meet in the Rules Committee 
room. We are meeting in the Ways and 
Means Committee room or the Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee room, which are among the big-
gest committee rooms in the House be-
cause we are all trying to follow the 
advice of the Attending Physician. 
So we can debate whether this is the 
best way to move forward or not. That 
is fine. But let’s not make things up. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, you have heard the 
thundering defense of the constitu-
tionality of a constitutionally ques-
tionable proxy voting procedure. That 
is what our motion is in the previous 
question. 
My friend from Massachusetts is ab-
solutely certain that every constitu-
tional scholar in the land is on board 
and believes it is absolutely fine, which 
is good news for those of us who want 
the district court to decide, because 
the constitutionality can be sorted out 
in the courts in no time flat. 
If it is this settled of a question, we 
are saying just give it a couple of days. 
Let the court have an opinion. Let’s go 
ahead and sort this out. If it is a non-
judicial issue, then we will learn that. 
If it is so clear that it is okay, why 
won’t we allow time for the court to 
take a look? 
My friend from Massachusetts says 
we have had this debate and the House 
has spoken. That is undeniably true. 
Now, to be fair, it spoke in a bipartisan 
way against this; in a partisan way in 
favor of proxy voting; in a bipartisan 
way against proxy voting. 
Yes, the House has spoken, and, in a 
bipartisan way, we have serious con-
cerns that we would like to be ad-
dressed. If we defeat the previous ques-
tion, they will be. It is not going to 
slow down the underlying bill. It is not 
going to slow down any other impor-
tant issues on the House floor today. It 
simply delays proxy voting that has 
never before happened in this Chamber 
until the courts rule on its constitu-
tionality. 
Madam Speaker, the underlying pro-
vision is an extension of our Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act meas-
ures. This is something, as the major-
ity leader said, that we have done in a 
bipartisan way time and time again. I 
have been a part of that bipartisan coa-
lition. 
Today, we have a Senate bill in front 
of us, and a bipartisan House amend-
ment that improves that bill. 
What you didn’t hear from the major-
ity leader, what you didn’t hear from 
the Speaker, is that the Rules Com-
mittee did not allow that bipartisan 
amendment; and we have now a take- 
it-or-leave-it piece of legislation from 
the United States Senate. I get it; that 
happens to us sometimes, but it doesn’t 
have to happen to us today. 
We have a bipartisan option, a bipar-
tisan choice. We, collectively, if we 
pass this rule, will choose to ignore 
that opportunity, an opportunity that, 
in a bipartisan way, we agree both pro-
tects national security and protects 
civil liberties better than the under-
lying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know how 
many of my colleagues decided to show 
up for the vote today. We will soon find 
out. Each one who is voting by proxy is 
going to have to go through you and 
the Member they have designated. 
The two issues before us are serious 
issues, and they are threatened by the 
underlying constitutional issue of the 
manner in which we will vote, as will 
every single vote we take until this 
measure is litigated. 
Let’s litigate first. Let’s not throw 
all of this important work into ques-
tion. If my friend from Massachusetts 
is right and it is crystal clear legally, 
we will find out in no time flat. 
But if my friend from Massachusetts 
is wrong, then we will prevent the next 
round of litigation that calls into ques-
tion every single bill this House acts 
on between now and then. 
I want to close, Madam Speaker, by 
saying I don’t question my friend from 
Massachusetts’ love of this institution 
or his understanding and knowledge of 
the Constitution. He is in a tough spot 
as the Rules Committee chairman. We 
have a crisis in front of us. It was his 
job to move something forward. 
The report he wrote earlier this year 
reflected his wisdom. The measure this 
House passed reflected his wisdom. He 
has got a very difficult job, and that is 
why you hear the very passionate de-
fense he is making of what will become 
known as the McGovern language. 
But let it not be said by any Member 
of this Chamber that his intent is any-
thing other than serving this country 
and serving this House. He is in a very 
difficult spot, but I know that his heart 
and his intellect are 100 percent with 
the people of this country and in serv-
ice to this institution. I regret that we 
are on different sides of this particular 
issue. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. 
Defeat it. Add this litigation timeout. 
If we can’t do that, then I need my col-
leagues to defeat the rule. Defeat the 
rule, and let’s take a better bite at this 
decision with the bipartisan amend-
ments that we have before us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me thank my colleague from 
Georgia (Mr. WOODALL). This is his last

term and, believe it or not, I am going 
to miss him. He is a spirited debater. 
But I want to say, and I say this sin-
cerely, I appreciate his advocacy for 
his point of view. I usually disagree 
with it, but I know it is based on prin-
ciple and conviction, and he sticks to 
the facts. He doesn’t come to the floor 
and make things up. He actually sticks 
to the facts. We have disagreements on 
those facts, and that is the way debate 
should be. It should be based on what is 
real, what are the facts. 
Madam Speaker, as you heard today, 
this is a difficult issue, the underlying 
legislation that we are dealing with 
with regard to FISA. It is one that cuts 
across party lines, and many Members 
have strong opinions. 
As I said earlier, I opposed the origi-
nal PATRIOT Act and subsequent reau-
thorizations. I appreciate the work of 
many of my colleagues in getting re-
forms included in the underlying bill 
that are badly needed. I think we need 
to do much more to truly respect all 
Americans’ fundamental right to pri-
vacy. 
b 1630 
I think it is a false choice to suggest 
that either we can fight terrorism and 
wrongdoing or uphold the right to pri-
vacy. 
There has been a lot of debate on 
both sides of the Capitol, and the Presi-
dent has weighed in recently. The At-
torney General has suggested that the 
President should veto this bill not be-
cause the Attorney General wants 
more reforms like the ones that the 
Senate put in or the ones that have 
been suggested. It is quite the opposite. 
The Attorney General doesn’t want any 
more checks and balances put in place. 
As I said earlier, that scares me be-
cause I don’t trust him. I just don’t. 
Now, the House will have a chance to 
work its will. My vote on the under-
lying bill will be ‘‘no.’’ But I respect 
many of my colleagues who feel strong-
ly that we ought to move forward and 
approve the bill that originated in this 
House then went to the Senate where 
additions were made in the Senate, and 
now it is back to the House. So, this 
has been a process that has not been 
short-circuited in any way, shape, or 
form. 
But I think that given the fact that 
the Senate passed this with 80 percent 
of the Senate voting in favor of it— 
again, I would have voted ‘‘no’’ if I 
were in the Senate. But 80 percent of 
them voted in favor of it. Madam 
Speaker, you can’t get 80 percent of the 
Senate to agree on lunch, yet they 
voted affirmatively on this. 
We voted in the House. Two-thirds of 
this Chamber, Democrats and Repub-
licans, voted ‘‘yes.’’ I voted ‘‘no.’’ But 
the idea that somehow there isn’t 
strong support to move forward I think 
is not justified by the facts. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule so we 
can move forward. 
I would again differ with my friends 
on the previous question. I think what 
we did to try to accommodate the re-
ality that we are faced with during this 
COVID–19 crisis was responsible and de-
liberative. We attempted to work in a 
bipartisan way. 
In fact, many of the parts of this pro-
posal reflect Republican suggestions. I 
regret that we did not come to a con-
clusion that we all could agree on, but 
as I said before, the minority leader’s 
insistence that somehow we all be 
prioritized in terms of testing was a 
nonstarter. His insistence that he had 
veto power over everything and that he 
would use that veto power so we 
couldn’t operate remotely was also a 
nonstarter. 
We need to do our work, and we need 
to do it in a way where all Members 
during this pandemic can participate. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 981 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 4. H. Res. 965 shall have no force or ef-
fect until such time as the ongoing litigation 
into the constitutionality of proxy voting is 
complete. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
f 
UYGHUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY 
ACT OF 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the vote on the mo-
tion to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 3744) to condemn gross human 
rights violations of ethnic Turkic Mus-
lims in Xinjiang, and calling for an end 
to arbitrary detention, torture, and 
harassment of these communities in-
side and outside China, on which the 
yeas and nays were ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SHERMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 413, nays 1,

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, on May 27, 2020, 
two American Astronauts were scheduled to 
make history as our nation returns to human 
space flight. Due to the historic nature of this 
event in my District at Kennedy Space Center, 
I missed two votes. Had I been present, I 
would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 110 
and ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 111.

LAW ENFORCEMENT SUICIDE 
DATA COLLECTION ACT 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 2746) to require the Director of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 
provide information on suicide rates in 
law enforcement, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2746 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Law En-
forcement Suicide Data Collection Act’’. 
SEC. 2. INFORMATION ON SUICIDE IN LAW EN-
FORCEMENT. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than 1 year 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Attorney General, acting through the Direc-
tor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
shall establish, for the purpose of preventing 
future law enforcement suicides and pro-
moting understanding of suicide in law en-
forcement, the Law Enforcement Officers 
Suicide Data Collection Program, under 
which law enforcement agencies may submit 
to the Director information on suicides and 
attempted suicides within such law enforce-
ment agencies, including information on— 
(1) the circumstances and events that oc-
curred before each suicide or attempted sui-
cide; 
(2) the general location of each suicide or 
attempted suicide; 
(3) the demographic information of each 
law enforcement officer who commits or at-
tempts suicide; 
(4) the occupational category, including 
criminal investigator, corrections officer, 
line of duty officer, 911 dispatch operator, of 
each law enforcement officer who commits 
or attempts suicide; and 
(5) the method used in each suicide or at-
tempted suicide. 
(b) POLICIES.—The Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation shall work with the Confidentiality 
and Data Access Committee of the Federal 
Committee on Statistical Methodology to 
develop publication policies to manage the 
risk of identity disclosure based upon the 
best practices identified by other Federal 
statistical programs. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 2 years after 
the date of enactment of this Act, and annu-
ally thereafter, the Attorney General, acting 
through the Director of the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, shall submit to Congress 
and publish on the website of the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation a report containing the 
information submitted to the Director pur-
suant to subsection (a). 
(d) CONFIDENTIALITY.—The report described 
under subsection (c) may not include any 
personally identifiable information of a law 
enforcement officer who commits or at-
tempts suicide. 
(e) DEFINITIONS.—In this section— 
(1) the term ‘‘law enforcement agency’’ 
means a Federal, State, Tribal, or local 
agency engaged in the prevention, detection, 
or investigation, prosecution, or adjudica-
tion of any violation of the criminal laws of 
the United States, a State, Tribal, or a polit-
ical subdivision of a State; 
(2) the term ‘‘law enforcement officer’’ 
means any current or former officer (includ-
ing a correctional officer), agent, or em-
ployee of the United States, a State, Indian 
Tribe, or a political subdivision of a State 
authorized by law to engage in or supervise 
the prevention, detection, investigation, or 
prosecution of any violation of the criminal 
laws of the United States, a State, Indian 
Tribe, or a political subdivision of a State; 
and 
(3) the term ‘‘State’’ means each of the 
several States, the District of Columbia, and 
any commonwealth, territory, or possession 
of the United States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TITUS). Pursuant to the rule, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. NADLER) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. RESCHENTHALER) each will control 
20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of S. 2746, the Law Enforcement 
Suicide Data Collection Act, which re-
quires the FBI to establish a data col-
lection program that gathers data on 
law enforcement and former law en-
forcement suicides at the local, State, 
and Federal levels. 
We consider this bill today in re-
sponse to a growing epidemic of law en-
forcement suicides in America. Trag-
ically, more than 227 U.S. law enforce-
ment officers took their own lives last 
year, an increase of more than 50 
deaths from the year before. 
While law enforcement officers are 
tasked with the responsibility of pro-
tecting our communities and respond-
ing to often dangerous emergency situ-
ations, the number who have died as a 
result of suicide has, in recent years, 
exceeded the numbers of officers lost in 
the line of duty. 
My community has been particularly 
affected by this issue. Last year, the 
New York Police Department lost nine 
officers in a deeply troubling string of 
suicides. With long, late hours, regular 
traumatic experiences, life-threatening 
situations, and work in constant prox-
imity to firearms, law enforcement of-
ficers are at an increased risk for men-
tal 
illness 
such 
as 
post-traumatic 
stress disorder, depression, and anx-
iety. 
A number of reports over past dec-
ades indicate that that law enforce-
ment officers have an increased risk of 
suicide when compared to the general 
public. While suicide is currently the 
leading cause of death for law enforce-
ment officers, the nearly 18,000 law en-
forcement agencies in this country 
lack a unified reporting mechanism for 
collecting data on these tragedies. 
b 2015 
Without the proper information and 
statistics, law enforcement agencies 
and local, State, and Federal leaders 
are hindered in their ability to edu-
cate, prevent, and respond to this epi-
demic of suicides. 
This bill directs the FBI to establish 
the Law Enforcement Officers Suicide 
Data Collection Program to prevent fu-
ture suicides and to promote the under-
standing of suicide in law enforcement 
by collecting information from Fed-
eral, State, and local law enforcement 
agencies. 
Data allowed to be collected pursu-
ant to this bill includes details relating 
to both suicides and attempted sui-
cides, including the circumstances and 
location of each event, as well as demo-
graphic information of each law en-
forcement officer and the method used 
in each incident. 
It is imperative that the law enforce-
ment community, mental health pro-
fessionals, Congress, and the American 
people better understand the extent of, 
and the reasons for, this crisis. 
The bill, therefore, also requires pub-
lic reporting of the FBI’s findings so 
that Congress and others can best sup-
port State and local agencies that are 
grappling with the day-to-day con-
sequences of officer suicide. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
the bipartisan effort to address this im-
portant issue. In the House, our col-
league, Representative MIKE QUIGLEY, 
authored H.R. 3735, the companion to 
this Senate-passed bill. I commend 
him, and I commend the bill’s Senate 
sponsor, Senator CATHERINE
CORTEZ 
MASTO, for their tireless work on be-
half of law enforcement officers and 
their loved ones. 
Madam Speaker, I support this bill. I 
urge my colleagues to do the same, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 2746, the Law Enforcement Suicide 
Data Collection Act. 
Last year, Congress passed and the 
President signed into law the STOIC 
Act, a bill that I introduced with my 
good 
friend, 
Congresswoman 
MAD-
ELEINE DEAN. That bill improves men-
tal health treatment for our Nation’s 
law enforcement officers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2315 
May 27, 2020 
Today, we are once again taking ac-
tion to address the disturbingly high 
suicide rate among our police officers. 
The Law Enforcement Suicide Data 
Collection Act, which I am a very 
proud cosponsor of, would require the 
Federal Government to track suicides 
within the law enforcement commu-
nity. 
According to Blue HELP, which is a 
nonprofit working to reduce stigmas 
attached to mental health for those in 
the law enforcement community, a 
record number of current or former po-
lice officers died by suicide last year; 
228 current or former officers died by 
suicide in 2019, compared with 172 in 
2018. 
Since Blue HELP began collecting 
data over 4 years ago, more law en-
forcement officers have died by suicide 
than all other line-of-duty deaths com-
bined. Organizations like Blue HELP 
do the best they can to track these 
tragic instances of law enforcement 
suicide. However, there is no com-
prehensive government effort to track 
attempted suicides and suicides in the 
law enforcement community. 
Line-of-duty 
deaths 
are 
tracked 
through the FBI’s Law Enforcement 
Officers Killed and Assaulted Program. 
This program aims to provide poten-
tially lifesaving information to law en-
forcement agencies with a focus on pre-
venting 
future 
incidents. 
Suicide 
should similarly be tracked so we can 
implement more effective suicide pre-
vention programs, in turn saving more 
lives. 
S. 2746 requires the FBI Director to 
establish the Law Enforcement Officers 
Suicide Data Collection Program to 
collect data on law enforcement and 
former law enforcement suicides at the 
local, State, and Federal levels. Par-
ticipating law enforcement agencies 
will report suicide information to the 
FBI Director. The FBI Director will 
then submit a report to Congress and 
publish the report online to share this 
vital information on suicides and at-
tempted suicides in law enforcement. 
Madam Speaker, 2 weeks ago, we rec-
ognized National Law Enforcement 
Week. While we may be too late in tak-
ing up this legislation for Police Week, 
it is never too late to help the brave 
men and women who protect our com-
munities. 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
STEUBE, QUIGLEY, and DEAN, as well as 
Senators 
BLUNT, 
HAWLEY, 
CORTEZ 
MASTO, and COONS, for introducing this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting S. 
2746, the Law Enforcement Suicide 
Data Collection Act, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, in this time of great 
national crisis, we are all even more 
dependent on our law enforcement per-
sonnel, on our first responders, on the 
heroes that we honored by the title of 
the bill we passed a couple of weeks 
ago, the HEROES Act. 
It is unfortunate, obviously, that the 
stress that some of these heroes under-
go, the stress that our police officers 
undergo, leads to a greater suicide 
rate. Especially in this time of crisis, 
we can expect that only to increase. It 
is imperative that we do whatever we 
can to safeguard the lives of those we 
depend on, to safeguard the lives of the 
heroes that we all need. 
Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate 
that we do not have a national data-
base with which to inform proper ac-
tions to help deal with this problem 
and save lives. That is why we are sup-
porting this bill today, to solve this 
problem, to eliminate this void, so that 
we can better inform ourselves, the 
country, all the different agencies in 
the country, and State, Federal, and 
local agencies as to what actions might 
be taken to mitigate this threat to the 
lives of those we depend on. 
Madam Speaker, I very much urge 
the passage of this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have no speakers at this 
time, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding me 
the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Law Enforcement Suicide 
Data Collection Act, a Senate com-
panion to bipartisan legislation that I 
authored and introduced to address the 
mental health needs of law enforce-
ment officers across the country. 
Every day, our officers put their lives 
on the line to protect our communities. 
They work long shifts and respond to 
dangerous calls in order to keep crime 
off our streets and keep our citizens 
safe. This critical work does not come 
without a cost. Law enforcement offi-
cers often experience post-traumatic 
stress from their work environment. 
According to multiple studies, offi-
cers are more than twice as likely to 
die by suicide than in line-of-duty-re-
lated homicides or accidents. Suicide 
has become the number one cause of 
deaths for Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement officers around the coun-
try. In fact, in my hometown of Chi-
cago, the officer suicide rate is 60 per-
cent higher than the national average. 
Despite 
these 
sobering 
statistics, 
there is no Federal Government pro-
gram to track the number of officers 
who attempt suicide or lose their lives 
to suicide every year. My legislation 
creates a data collection program with-
in the FBI to track law enforcement 
suicides at the local, State, and Fed-
eral levels. 
By providing accurate and detailed 
information, this bill would help police 
departments implement more effective 
suicide prevention and post-prevention 
programs. These intervention programs 
will save lives. 
It is our turn to bring the brave men 
and women who fight for us the care 
they need and deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to 
Chairman NADLER for his support of 
this 
important 
mission 
and 
for 
prioritizing this piece of legislation 
and bringing it to the House floor. I 
thank the committee staff and Hannah 
from my own staff for her extraor-
dinary work on this measure. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support the Law Enforcement Sui-
cide Data Collection bill today. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I again urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on S. 2746, the 
Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collec-
tion Act, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, we appreciate the 
service of our law enforcement officers 
who face unique challenges and risks in 
protecting us every day. Today, we 
take an important step to recognize 
the psychological toll that serving in 
such an inherently dangerous job can 
take on law enforcement officers and 
work to combat the tragic epidemic of 
suicides among their ranks. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in supporting the Law En-
forcement Suicide Data Collection Act 
so that we may be better able to ad-
dress this crisis and save lives. 
Throughout our country, the vast 
majority of police officers execute 
their jobs with dignity, honor, and re-
spect for the citizens they serve and 
protect, but it would be remiss if I did 
not take note of the alarming and ap-
palling incidents involving individuals 
in law enforcement in the last few 
weeks. These include the death of 
Breonna 
Taylor 
in 
Kentucky 
and 
George Floyd in Minnesota, both at the 
hands of law enforcement officers, and 
the 
disturbing 
circumstances 
sur-
rounding the death of Ahmaud Arbery 
in Georgia. 
We must bring all those responsible 
to justice and work to improve ac-
countability between law enforcement 
officers and the communities they 
serve. 
While we appreciate all of our law en-
forcement officers, we can’t hide from 
America’s history of racism and its 
deadly consequences. We see it in the 
disproportionate rate of COVID deaths, 
in our country’s rates of mass incarcer-
ation, and, yes, in the treatment of Af-
rican Americans by a few of our police 
officers. 
The ugly truth is clear: Black Ameri-
cans often live under different rules. It 
is up to all of us to change them. 
Working with my colleagues on the 
Committee on the Judiciary and with 
Members of Congress from all across 
the country, I will continue to fight to 
do so.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2316 
May 27, 2020 
But the bill before us today is a nec-
essary and worthy bill, recognizing the 
honorable and selfless service that the 
vast majority of our police officers pro-
vide, and trying to deal with the high 
suicide rates that the stresses of this 
job that they do to protect us cause. 
We should pass this bill so we can 
start getting a handle on this problem 
to preserve the lives of the vast major-
ity of our police officers who serve us 
honorably and without whom we would 
be adrift. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
member of the Law Enforcement Caucus and 
a senior member of the Committees on the 
Judiciary and Homeland Security, I rise in sup-
port of S. 2746, the ‘‘Law Enforcement Suicide 
Data Collection Act,’’ which requires the FBI to 
open a voluntary data collection program to 
track suicides and attempted suicides within 
local, tribal, state and federal law enforcement. 
Information collected and maintained by the 
FBI will not include any personally identifiable 
information. 
The legislation also directs the FBI Director 
to submit an annual report on the data to Con-
gress and publish the report on the FBI 
website. 
This program would serve as the principal 
data collection tool on suicides and attempted 
suicides within law enforcement across the 
country. 
It is altogether fitting and proper that we do 
this to commemorate National Police Week, 
which occurred earlier this month. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation reminds us 
of the enormous strain law enforcement per-
sonnel necessarily endure daily as they try to 
do their best to keep our communities safe 
and healthy. 
By providing accurate and detailed informa-
tion on these suicides and attempted suicides, 
more effective prevention programs could be 
implemented to save lives. 
I urge all members to Join me in voting for 
S. 2746, the Law Enforcement Suicide Data 
Collection Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2746. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER 
PANDEMIC RESPONSE ACT OF 2020 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 6509) to amend the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 
1968 to provide public safety officer 
death and disability benefits for cer-
tain public safety officers who contract 
COVID–19, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6509 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Public Safe-
ty Officer Pandemic Response Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. DEATH AND DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR 
PUBLIC 
SAFETY 
OFFICERS 
IM-
PACTED BY COVID-19. 
Section 1201 of the Omnibus Crime Control 
and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281) 
is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new subsection: 
‘‘(o) For purposes of this part: 
‘‘(1) COVID–19 (or complications there-
from) shall be presumed to constitute a per-
sonal injury within the meaning of sub-
section (a), sustained in the line of duty by 
a public safety officer and directly and proxi-
mately resulting in death, in the case of a 
public safety officer who was diagnosed with, 
who received a positive test for, or for whom 
evidence indicated that the officer was in-
fected with, COVID–19, unless such officer 
was not on duty during the 45-day period 
prior to being diagnosed with or having posi-
tive test for COVID–19. 
‘‘(2) The Attorney General shall accept 
claims, 
including 
supplemental 
claims, 
under this section from an individual who— 
‘‘(A) was serving as a public safety officer 
and was injured or disabled in the line of 
duty as a result of the terrorist attacks on 
the United States that occurred on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, or in the aftermath of such 
attacks developed a condition described in 
section 3312(a) of the Public Health Service 
Act (42 U.S.C. 300mm–22(a)); and 
‘‘(B) was diagnosed with COVID–19 during 
the period described in paragraph (3), which, 
in combination with the injury or disability 
described in subparagraph (A), permanently 
and totally disabled or directly and proxi-
mately resulted in the death of the indi-
vidual. 
In assessing a claim under this paragraph, 
the presumption of causation described in 
paragraph (1) shall apply. 
‘‘(3) The presumption described in para-
graph (1) and standard in subsection (p) shall 
apply with respect to a diagnosis of COVID– 
19 (or complications therefrom) beginning on 
January 20, 2020, and ending on January 20, 
2022. 
‘‘(4) The term ‘COVID–19’ means a disease 
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV–2). 
‘‘(p) In determining whether the personal 
injury under subsection (b) resulting from 
COVID-19 (or complications therefrom) was a 
catastrophic injury, the Attorney General’s 
inquiry shall apply the presumption in sub-
section (o) and be limited to whether the in-
dividual is permanently prevented from per-
forming any gainful work as a public safety 
officer.’’. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ or this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include any ex-
traneous material on the bill under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 6509, the Public Safety Of-
ficer Pandemic Response Act. I intro-
duced this bill on April 14 in response 
to the escalating and deadly threat of 
the COVID–19 virus to our public safety 
officers, and I am pleased that the 
House is considering it today. 
H.R. 6509 expands the Public Safety 
Officers’ Benefits program, known as 
the PSOB program, to ensure that pub-
lic safety officers who contract COVID– 
19 in the line of duty are eligible for 
benefits under the program should they 
become disabled or should they die 
from the virus. 
Madam Speaker, this bill would ac-
complish three critical objectives. 
First, it establishes that a diagnosis, 
a positive test, or evidence of COVID–19 
infection shall be presumed to con-
stitute a personal injury in the line of 
duty for the purposes of eligibility for 
the PSOB program, unless the officer 
was not on duty in the relevant time 
period. 
Second, it ensures that officers who 
were injured or disabled in the line of 
duty in relation to the attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and whose injuries in 
combination with a COVID–19 illness 
rendered them disabled or caused their 
death will receive benefits under the 
PSOB program. 
b 2030 
And, third, it establishes that the 
COVID–19-related disability standard is 
based on whether a PSOB claimant is 
permanently 
prevented 
from 
per-
forming any gainful work as a public 
safety officer on account of a COVID–19 
diagnosis. 
Because of the demands placed on 
public safety officers during this crisis, 
it is important that Congress enact all 
of these elements. 
In seeking to protect and serve their 
communities in their various roles, 
public safety officers willingly under-
take risks of harm on a daily basis. Be-
cause of this, we have established the 
PSOB program to provide disability 
and death benefits for them when they 
are disabled or die due to line-of-duty 
injuries. 
During the current crisis of COVID– 
19 contagion, the risks to public safety 
officers go well beyond the dangers 
first responders ordinarily experience. 
Police officers, firefighters, and EMTs 
are often the first responders that 
those with COVID–19 encounter. 
Current estimates are that nearly 40 
percent 
of 
COVID–19 
carriers 
are

asymptomatic. Therefore, for first re-
sponders, even ordinary encounters 
with members of the community be-
come 
potentially 
life-threatening 
events. 
On top of this, a lack of availability 
of 
appropriate 
personal 
protective 
equipment has unnecessarily exposed 
thousands of officers to COVID–19. De-
spite the additional risks they take on, 
public safety officers continue to faith-
fully execute their jobs and protect us 
all. 
H.R. 6509 acknowledges this by clari-
fying and expanding certain aspects of 
how the existing PSOB program for of-
ficers who contract COVID–19 is ap-
plied. 
If an officer was on duty during this 
crisis and contracts this disease, his or 
her illness should be considered a line- 
of-duty injury. And officers who are 
disabled due to COVID–19 should be eli-
gible for disability benefits under a less 
stringent standard, given the added 
risks they undertook during this crisis, 
particularly 
because 
many 
officers 
have not been given appropriate equip-
ment to mitigate their risk. 
We must also address another unique 
and tragic circumstance. I have long 
been a champion of the public safety 
officers who provided their service in 
responding to the deadly 9/11 attacks 
on our country. In fact, this bill is 
modeled on legislation that Congress 
enacted just days after 9/11, which I au-
thored, to ensure that public safety of-
ficers who were injured or killed in the 
line of duty because of 9/11 received the 
benefits they deserved. 
Many first responders lost their lives 
that day; and in the days and weeks 
following the attacks, thousands of 
public safety officers rushed in to help 
the injured and to seek the remains of 
those who perished. 
Numerous studies have sadly shown 
that, as a result of these attacks, these 
public safety officers were exposed to a 
slew of toxic chemicals and dust that 
directly inhibit lung capacity. There-
fore, 9/11 public safety officers are 
uniquely 
vulnerable 
to 
COVID–19, 
which attacks a person’s ability to 
breathe effectively. 
H.R. 6509 acknowledges that the serv-
ice of public safety officers during and 
after 9/11 continues to put them at a 
higher risk of disability or death. This 
bill allows those officers who were in-
jured or disabled in the line of duty in 
relation to 9/11 and whose injuries, in 
combination with COVID–19 illness, 
rendered them disabled or caused their 
death to apply for benefits under the 
PSOB program. 
To date, Congress has upheld its 
promise to 9/11 first responders who, on 
account of their injuries on 9/11, have 
been tragically succumbing to cancers 
and other diseases. Today, we will do 
so again. 
I note that the Sergeants Benevolent 
Association of the New York City Po-
lice Department wrote to me yesterday 
expressing strong support for this bill 
and citing the importance of including 
provisions addressing the 9/11 issue in 
this legislation. 
We have also received letters of sup-
port for this bill from the Fraternal 
Order of Police and the National Asso-
ciation of Police Organizations. 
I include all of these letters in the 
RECORD. 
SERGEANTS
BENEVOLENT
ASSOCIA-
TION, POLICE DEPARTMENT, CITY 
OF NEW YORK, 
New York, NY, May 26, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington. DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing on be-
half of the more 13,000 members of the Ser-
geants Benevolent Association of the New 
York City Police Department to advise you 
of our strong support for H.R. 6509, the ‘‘Pub-
lic Safety Officer Pandemic Response Act.’’ 
This important legislation will establish a 
much needed presumption to enable the Pub-
lic Safety Officers’ Benefits (PSOB) Program 
to process death and disability benefits for 
our frontline law enforcement officers, fire-
fighters, and EMTs exposed to COVID–19. 
Nearly nineteen years ago, thousands of 
first responders in New York and across the 
country were exposed to a deadly cocktail of 
toxins at the sites of the worst terrorist at-
tack in American history. To date, exposure 
to those toxins has claimed the lives of more 
police officers than died on 9/11 itself. While 
today we fully recognize the toll suffered by 
the rescue and recovery personnel in the 
months alter 9/11, that was not always the 
case. And it required nearly all of the past 
nineteen years to fully secure health and 
compensation benefits for impacted first re-
sponders. The lessons of the 9/11 health crisis 
are the historical context for which you, the 
SBA, and others are seeking to address both 
the 
actual 
short-term 
and 
potential 
longterm consequences of the COVID–19 pan-
demic on public safety officers. We are unfor-
tunately experiencing the short-term impact 
of this disease on the ranks of law enforce-
ment, which has already claimed the lives of 
more than 100 officers, including six from the 
NYPD. But we do not yet know the long- 
term effects COVID–19 will present to those 
exposed to it. 
While the PSOB Program currently covers 
deaths and disabilities from ‘‘infectious dis-
ease,’’ providing evidence that a disease was 
contracted in the line of duty is not always 
straightforward. In this current pandemic, 
making the connection between an officer’s 
death or disability from COVID–19 and one 
specific exposure to a carrier of the disease 
is likely impossible. H.R. 6509 addresses this 
issue by establishing a full presumptive 
standard for COVID–19-related death and dis-
ability claims for PSOB benefits. It will also 
create a similar presumptive standard for 
those officers who are suffering from 9/11 
health conditions and are at significantly 
higher risk from this disease. In so doing, 
the ‘‘Public Safety Officer Pandemic Re-
sponse Act’’ affords Congress the oppor-
tunity to be proactive in its response to the 
threat COVID–19 poses to the public safety 
community and ensures that our nation’s he-
roes are not subjected to another lengthy 
battle to obtain the benefits they are enti-
tled to. 
On behalf of the membership of the SBA, 
thank you for your leadership on this legis-
lation and your legacy of supporting positive 
enhancements to the PSOB Program. Please 
do not hesitate to contact me. 
Sincerely, 
ED MULLINS, 
President. 
NATIONAL FRATERNAL ORDER 
OF POLICE, 
Washington, DC, May 27, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY P. PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN O. MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER
AND REPRESENTA-
TIVE MCCARTHY: I am writing on behalf of 
the members of the Fraternal Order of Police 
to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 
6509, the ‘‘Public Safety Officer Pandemic 
Response Act,’’ and to urge the House to pass 
it. 
We knew at the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic that law enforcement officers on 
the front lines combating this pandemic 
would be increasingly vulnerable to con-
tracting the virus. As we had feared, the 
virus has claimed the lives of many, and now 
includes a growing number of law enforce-
ment officers. As of today, 112 law enforce-
ment officers have died from COVID–19 re-
lated illnesses. 
The 
Public 
Safety 
Officers’ 
Benefits 
(PSOB) program provides that the surviving 
family members of a public safety officer 
who contracts an infectious disease in the 
line of duty and dies as a result of its con-
traction are eligible for the PSOB’s death 
benefit. With the help of the President and 
the Attorney General, the Bureau of Justice 
Assistance (BJA) announced on 9 April that 
a death benefit claim for a COVID–19 related 
death will be found by the BJA to have con-
tracted the disease in the line of duty in 
most cases. This was a vitally important 
issue for our members on the front lines dur-
ing this pandemic and this legislation would 
expand and codify this presumption. 
In addition to the presumption for death 
benefit claims, H.R. 6509 would ensure that 
public safety officers who contract COVID–19 
in the line of duty are eligible for benefits 
should they become disabled from the novel 
coronavirus. It would establish new stand-
ards for disability claims related to COVID– 
19 by defining ‘‘catastrophic injury’’ in cases 
where the injured officer was ‘‘permanently 
prevented from performing any gainful work 
as a public safety officer.’’ At a time of 
heightened risk from this pandemic, we be-
lieve this is necessary to ensure that these 
officers and their families, who are not able 
to ‘‘stay at home’’ during this crisis, will be 
taken care of in the event they are disabled 
and unable to continue to serve as law en-
forcement officers. 
The legislation also recognizes the unique 
vulnerability of officers who were injured or 
disabled in the line of duty in relation to the 
attacks of September 11. 2001, and whose in-
juries—in combination with a line-of-duty 
COVID–19 illness—rendered them disabled or 
caused their death will be eligible to receive 
the death or disability benefits under the 
PSOB program. 
On behalf of the more than 351,000 members 
of the Fraternal Order of Police, I urge the 
House to pass this measure and send it to the 
Senate. If I can be of any further assistance, 
please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Sincerely, 
PATRICK YOES, 
National President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2318 
May 27, 2020 
I am writing to you to express our strong 
support for the Public Safety Officer Pan-
demic Response Act of 2020 (H.R. 6509). 
The PSOB Program was designed to offer 
peace of mind to men and women seeking ca-
reers in public safety and to make a strong 
statement about the value that American 
Society places on the contributions of those 
who serve their communities in potentially 
dangerous circumstances, such as the cur-
rent coronavirus pandemic. Officers have 
been protecting our communities with insuf-
ficient personal protective equipment (PPE), 
putting themselves at high risk of exposure 
to this very communicable disease. 
While the PSOB Program does cover line of 
duty deaths and disabilities due to infectious 
diseases, we feel strongly that COVID–19 is 
unique and presents its own challenges in 
proving line of duty exposure. While with 
most other infectious diseases, it is easy to 
pinpoint the source and details surrounding 
the exposure, but this situation is more dif-
ficult with the new coronavirus and its 
asymptomatic spread. Every day, we are 
learning more about COVID–19. First, it was 
believed it could only be spread by close 
human contact. Now, experts know that it 
can also be spread through the air. Individ-
uals can be carriers of COVID–19 without 
being symptomatic. Our officers have found 
themselves in an extraordinary and dan-
gerous situation over which they have very 
little control. 
The Public Safety Officer Pandemic Re-
sponse Act would establish that COVID–19 
shall be presumed to have been contracted as 
a result of the officer’s service for the pur-
poses of PSOB death and disability benefits. 
It would create a specific standard for 
COVID–19-related disability this is based on 
whether a PSOB claimant is permanently 
prevented from performing any gainful work 
as a public safety officer due to their COVID– 
19 diagnosis. Finally, it would recognize the 
physical toll 9/11 related illnesses have had 
on first responders by covering under the 
PSOB Program those public safety officers 
whose 9/11 related illness are compounded by 
a COVID–19 diagnosis and lead to their death 
or disability. 
For these reasons, NAPO wholeheartedly 
supports the Public Safety Officer Pandemic 
Response Act and we call on the House of 
Representatives to pass this important legis-
lation. If we can provide any additional in-
formation or assistance, please feel free to 
contact me. 
Sincerely, 
WILLIAM J. JOHNSON, 
Executive Director. 
Mr. NADLER. I also want to note 
that, as we work to support our first 
responders today, we must also support 
other essential workers who are on the 
front lines of this pandemic, like those 
in the food and healthcare industries 
who are putting their lives at risk each 
day during this crisis. 
We should ensure that all those who 
are making the ultimate sacrifice for 
their communities, for us, are properly 
compensated. That work begins today 
with supporting our public safety offi-
cers with this bill. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tive MAX ROSE from New York and 
Representative BILL
PASCRELL
from 
New Jersey, for their support of this 
measure from its inception. And I ask 
my colleagues in the House to join me 
in supporting this bill so that we can 
pass it today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, America’s law en-
forcement officers, firefighters, and 
other first responders are on the front 
lines 
of 
the 
fight 
against 
the 
coronavirus. Over 100 public safety offi-
cers tragically lost their lives due to 
COVID–19, and that number will inevi-
tably continue to rise. 
During this challenging time, it is 
critical that we ensure our officers and 
their loved ones can utilize the Depart-
ment of Justice’s Public Safety Offi-
cers’ Benefits program. 
The PSOB program was created to 
aid officers killed or totally disabled 
on the job. The program reviews over 
1,000 claims submitted every year and 
provides one-time payments of roughly 
$365,000 for officers who lost their lives 
or who were totally disabled in the line 
of duty. The program also provides 
monthly education benefits to the chil-
dren of these officers. 
While nothing can ever replace a 
loved one, this program gives our first 
responders peace of mind, knowing 
that their families will be taken care 
of should the worst happen. 
However, to receive benefits under 
current law, first responders must 
prove they contracted COVID–19 while 
on duty. Both Republicans and Demo-
crats agree: Congress must amend the 
PSOB program to create a presumption 
allowing officers and their families to 
receive assistance without facing this 
burdensome requirement. 
Unfortunately, the majority in the 
House is delaying these important ben-
efits. The Senate passed S. 3607, the bi-
partisan Safeguarding America’s First 
Responders Act of 2020, and they did 
this about 2 weeks ago. 
If House Democrats were actually se-
rious about getting these benefits to 
public safety officers, we would pass 
the Senate bill today and send it to the 
President to sign into law. Instead, 
House Democrats are again engaging in 
political games, rejecting the Senate’s 
bill and taking up the House’s bill, 
which includes several problematic 
provisions that the Senate will simply 
not agree to. 
I am very disappointed that the Dem-
ocrat majority would rather play par-
tisan politics than provide immediate 
assistance to brave, selfless men and 
women who are protecting our commu-
nities. However, I agree with the pri-
mary intent of this legislation, and I 
strongly support our Nation’s dedica-
tion to public safety officers. 
A few days ago, we honored those 
who made the ultimate sacrifice while 
serving our country in the armed serv-
ices. It is only right that we take care 
of first responders, who are also mak-
ing sacrifices every day for this great 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PASCRELL), one of the authors of this 
legislation. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise for our first responders who are 
risking their lives and the lives of their 
families. They go to work every day to 
fight this virus. They need our help. 
I am proud to join Chairman NADLER, 
Congressman MAX ROSE, and others in 
support of the Public Safety Officer 
Pandemic Response Act. Our bill will 
guarantee first responders receive Pub-
lic Safety Officer Benefits if the worst 
comes to pass, because there have been 
many delays. We need clarity so that 
there is no anxiety about this. 
In my district, the Ninth District of 
New Jersey, we tragically lost two first 
responders to COVID–19 in the line of 
duty. 
Israel Tolentino, a firefighter from 
Passaic, New Jersey, was 33 years old. 
It was Israel’s lifelong dream to be a 
firefighter. He made the ultimate sac-
rifice for our community fighting this 
pandemic. He leaves behind his wife 
and two young children. 
And we have lost Frank Scorpo, a po-
lice officer from my hometown of 
Paterson. I knew the family. He was 
only 34. He was a beloved member of 
the force. He leaves behind his wife and 
two sons, ages 4 and 6 months. 
Another person I want to recognize, 
who understands and is sensitive to 
this, for all the years he served here, is 
PETER KING of New York. He never, 
never missed an opportunity to stand 
up for law enforcement and their fami-
lies. 
These men are heroes, Scorpo and 
Tolentino. My heart and your heart 
bleeds for our fallen first responders. 
This bill ensures their families have 
some peace of mind that their benefits 
will be implemented. 
This legislation was part, as you 
know, of the landmark HEROES Act, 
which was passed a week and a half 
ago. We are passing it again to under-
score its critical importance. 
We owe a huge debt of gratitude to 
all first responders across New Jersey 
and around the country. We cannot 
make it to the other side of this mess 
without them. I thank them for their 
service, and God bless all of them. 
Thank you to law enforcement and 
fire service organizations who helped 
draft this legislation. I know they 
stand strong for their membership. 
I want to recognize Senator CORY 
BOOKER and Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY 
for working to protect our first re-
sponders. I know they are serious about 
creating this presumption. 
I have served as the co-chair of law 
enforcement in the Congress for over 16 
years. These are our men, these are our 
women in uniform. We must get this 
done. We cannot delay. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, we have no further speakers 
at this time, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ROSE), another sponsor of the bill.

H2319 
May 27, 2020 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman NADLER for 
his leadership and thank him for work-
ing with me on this effort. I also thank 
Congressman PASCRELL for his extraor-
dinary leadership in this regard. 
I stand in strong support of our bill, 
the Public Safety Officer Pandemic Re-
sponse Act, because when this pan-
demic came to the United States, one 
thing that was never, ever in doubt was 
that our first responders would put on 
their uniforms and they would risk 
their lives to keep us safe. 
It was never in doubt because when-
ever there has been a crisis, whether it 
came to my city or to our country, 
they have always rushed to be our first 
line of defense. On 9/11, they rushed 
into the towers. During Hurricane 
Sandy, they braved a superstorm. And 
now, during the pandemic, they are on 
the front lines against an invisible 
enemy that has claimed more than 
100,000 lives nationwide. 
Think of the toll this pandemic has 
taken on our Nation’s heroes. Think of 
all those who have gone months with-
out seeing their kids, their spouses, 
their own parents. Think of those who 
have gotten sick. Think of those who 
have lost their lives. 
The very least that Congress can do 
right now is give our police officers, 
our EMTs, our corrections officers, our 
firefighters, our public safety officers 
the peace of mind that, if the worst 
shall happen, we will be there for them 
and their families. 
b 2045 
When this bill becomes law—and it 
will become law—the family of an offi-
cer who was catastrophically injured or 
lost their life will not have to jump 
through hoops or prove that it was be-
cause of the coronavirus. They won’t 
have to spend 10 years litigating, try-
ing to convince the government that 
their sacrifice actually meant some-
thing. 
Today, we are not cutting red tape; 
we are stopping the red tape from hap-
pening in the first place. This effort 
has bipartisan support. And, nonethe-
less—and only in Washington, D.C., is 
this possible—it has yet to cross the 
finish line. Our officers cannot afford 
to wait, cannot afford to wait for poli-
tics. We can’t use our cops and our fire-
fighters as political pawns. 
My city has lost nearly a dozen 
FDNY heroes, over 40 NYPD officers, 
and so many more of our brave officers 
across the United States of America. 
Every Member of Congress loves to 
take pictures with our first responders. 
We love to thank them. We love to rely 
on them. They protect our families 
when we go to Washington, D.C. Well, 
today is the day we see who is willing 
to do more than offer them pretty 
words on Facebook. Who is willing to 
do more than take a selfie? 
Today, we see who is willing to help 
our first responders, like they wouldn’t 
hesitate to be there for us. God bless 
you and God bless the United States of 
America. Let’s be there for our first re-
sponders. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to offer strong support for 
the Public Safety Officer Pandemic Re-
sponse Act and to just take a little 
journey down memory lane. 
Just 2 days ago we honored the fallen 
that have sacrificed their lives for this 
Nation for our freedom. We could not 
help many of us who held Memorial 
Day ceremonies for the fallen and to 
acknowledge their families who at that 
time, as well, acknowledge the nearing 
100,000 mark of those who died from 
COVID–19. 
As a Member of the United States 
Congress here during 9/11, right here in 
this Capitol, watching the billowing 
smoke from the Pentagon, hearing 
about the Trade Center, and of course, 
about the plane that no one could find 
that wound up in Pennsylvania, in all 
of those instances, first responders 
rushed to the scene. They were on the 
front lines. 
I remember that; heroic actions. But 
at the same time, I remember, as a 
Member of the Homeland Security 
Committee, the long and arduous jour-
ney, the suffering that these individ-
uals had to go through to receive ulti-
mate compensation, even just a few 
months ago, or about a year ago, re-
minded of the first responders that 
were 
in 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
pleading 
again 
for 
compensation 
through the 9/11 bill. 
I believe that where we are today is 
the right direction to get in front of 
and to help those who are still on the 
front lines, firefighters and techs, law 
enforcement officers in a variety of 
service, they are still there, many of 
whom started with COVID–19 without 
the right PPEs, as many of them will 
tell you. Some who have already lost 
their lives. Many that continue to suf-
fer with the remnants or the effects of 
COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
sponsors and thank the chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee, Mr. NADLER. 
I want to thank Mr. PASCRELL and Mr. 
ROSE for all of the efforts to get in 
front, to say that the Nation does care. 
Because right now, Madam Speaker, as 
we are on this floor, there are emer-
gency workers rushing to someone’s 
home to be able to take them to a med-
ical facility to save their lives, or they 
may be in an emergency room right 
now. So COVID–19 has not ended. That 
is why we are wearing masks. COVID– 
19 has taken 100,000 lives with no end in 
sight. 
So I rise in support to be able to pro-
vide these lifesaving front-liners the 
safety net that they need, and the com-
pensation that they need, in order for 
us to say more than a thank you, but 
to acknowledge and honor them for 
their service. 
Let us hope that we can, as a Nation, 
follow 
the 
instructions 
of 
social 
distancing, testing, wearing masks, 
that we can overcome this. But all the 
time that we are taking that journey, 
we will be looking to these first re-
sponders to be on the first line. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for the 
time, and I ask our colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I am disappointed 
that we are not taking up the bipar-
tisan Senate-passed POS bill that had a 
clean fix to this issue. So I do want to 
say, I am disappointed that we are not 
running the Senate bill, which again, 
was bipartisan. 
But I do want to say, I support our 
Nation’s first responders, and I truly 
believe it is vital that they receive the 
benefits they have earned. So I urge 
my colleagues to support our Nation’s 
public service officers. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, the COVID–19 crisis 
in this country has taken many lives 
and impacted every community. In our 
national response, there are many 
areas in which we know we must do 
better and do more to address the pub-
lic health emergency and the economic 
impact on our people. 
This bill, which expands an existing 
program in several important ways will 
help address the tragic circumstances 
of public safety officers who are dis-
abled by or die from this virus. It is 
one piece of the overall effort, but an 
important one. 
Madam Speaker, I, therefore, ask my 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
passage of H.R. 6509 today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6509, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF PAYGO 
LEGISLATION 
Pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As- 
You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO), Mr. YAR-
MUTH hereby submits, prior to the vote 
on passage, for printing in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD, that H.R. 6509, the 
Public Safety Officer Pandemic Re-
sponse Act of 2020, as amended, would 
have no significant effect on the def-
icit, and therefore, the budgetary ef-
fects of such bill are estimated as zero.

EXPRESSING 
GRATITUDE 
TO 
MARK PETTITT FOR HIS SERV-
ICE TO AMERICA 
HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
after ably and honorably serving as my chief 
of staff for more than 9 years, Mark Pettitt will 
retire in June. Mark has provided exceptional 
leadership, and I’ve greatly benefited from 
having him as my chief advisor. I will miss his 
sound and candid guidance. 
When asked how he came to be my chief 
of staff, Mark will often reply, ‘‘I complained 
about politics too many times to an old friend.’’ 
That is only partly true. Really, it was Mark’s 
deeply ingrained sense of patriotism that led 
him to Capitol Hill. 
Mark’s tenure as chief of staff caps an al-
ready exemplary career as a successful pri-
vate sector engineer. For Mark, there are few 
more patriotic acts than simply working hard 
and contributing each day to America’s eco-
nomic and industrial prowess. 
Mark worked hard throughout his career. He 
earned both his masters and undergraduate 
degrees in engineering from Brigham Young 
University. He served as an R&D Engineer 
and Project Manager at Wylie Laboratories in 
Huntsville, Alabama from 1978 to 1989. While 
at Wylie, Mark earned his Professional Engi-
neer license. He went on to work as an Exec-
utive Consultant and Product Manager for 
Intergraph Corporation from 1989 to 2010. As 
an aside, Mark is a 10th degree Jiu Jitsu black 
belt. 
Given his private sector background, Mark 
offers a unique perspective on federal policy 
issues. Always one to put America first, Mark 
has been particularly active in addressing 
America’s trade imbalances and has long ad-
vocated for trade policies that benefit Amer-
ican workers. 
As Mark’s career concludes, I cannot thank 
him enough for the value he provided me, the 
Tennessee Valley, and America. I wish Mark 
joy and contentment as he embarks on this 
next phase of life. He is looking forward to en-
joying well-deserved time with his wife, Diane, 
five children—John, Jared, Ben, Nichole, and 
Joseph—and 12 grandchildren. Mark has 
earned every bit of that family time. 
America is a stronger, more prosperous na-
tion thanks to Mark’s exemplary career.

HONORING SWEET MAGNOLIAS 
DELI AND GRILLE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, in the midst of the Wuhan Virus pan-
demic it is so inspiring to learn of citizens vol-
unteering to assist persons in need. A classic 
example is Aimee Crosby of Pelion, South 
Carolina, who was highlighted in the article, 
‘‘How sweet it is’’ by Kay Collins on April 23rd 
in The Lexington Chronicle: 
A special recognition to Sweet Magnolias 
Deli Grille for partnering with the Pelion 
Senior Center to aid their Meals On Wheels. 
Owner Aimee Crosby advised WLTX that 
they have been able to keep all of their em-
ployees on the payroll. Because the commu-
nity has been supportive, they wanted to pay 
it forward. 
Sweet Magnolias joined Meals On Wheels 
to provide homebound seniors additional 
meals to have enough food to last all week. 
The meals include one meat and three sides, 
a roll and desert. Each plate has enough food 
for 2 meals. The community has donated $600 
and aims to raise $5,000 for 20 weeks of 
meals. 
The restaurant has started a GoFundMe 
page to help raise money. To donate please 
visit Sweet Magnolia’s Facebook page or 
GoFundMe.com ‘‘Bridging the Gap—Pelion.’’ 
Call Aimee Crosby during normal business 
hours for details. 
Lexington County Recreation and Aging 
Commission, Council of Aging thanks Sweet 
Magnolias who generously donated their 
time and resources to make sure 25 home-
bound seniors are not forgotten. Their East-
ern dinners were delivered by Laura Dowey, 
Pelion’s Senior Center Director, and her 
daughter.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 2020 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize National Police Week. Taking place 
during the week of May 10 through 16, 2020, 
National Police Week highlights our brave 
men and women in uniform for all their hard 
work keeping their communities safe. In the 
Fourth District of Colorado we are lucky to 
have many exemplary law enforcement offi-
cers serving the public every day. These dedi-
cated individuals risk their lives to protect oth-
ers and are deserving of our deepest grati-
tude, especially during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. I am proud to celebrate the many law 
enforcement officers in Colorado. 
I also rise to recognize the ultimate sacrifice 
made by several police officers while serving 
in Colorado’s 4th district. Corporal Daniel H. 
Groves of the Colorado State Patrol was killed 
in a vehicle accident during a blizzard on 
March 13, 2019. He was assisting a motorist 
who had skidded off the road when another 
vehicle lost control and struck him. Master 
Trooper William James Moden, also of the 
Colorado State Patrol, was killed while assist-
ing at the scene of a previous accident on 
June 14, 2019. He was also tragically struck 
by a passing vehicle. These brave men, both 
of whom had twelve years of dedicated serv-
ice to the Colorado State Patrol, died serving 
their communities and it is an honor to recog-
nize them for their sacrifice.

HONORING CHING KA LAU AS A 
DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN CEN-
TRAL 
FLORIDA 
FOR 
ASIAN 
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Ching Ka Lau, 
a native of Hong Kong, has been a resident of 
Orlando since 1999. In 2005, Mr. Lau and his 
wife, Shally Wong, first published Asia Trend 
Magazine, which has become a registered 501 
(c)(3) non-profit organization with the mission 
of strengthening understanding and commu-
nication for the local Asian American commu-
nity. 
Over many years, Mr. Lau has worked tire-
lessly together with local volunteers and 
commnunity leaders to organize enriching cul-
tural events in Central Florida, including the 
very first annual Dragon Parade in Orlando’s 
Mills 50 District during the Lunar New Year, 
the Asian Cultural Festival during May, and 
the Asian Cultural EXPO in October. These 
cultural events have helped bridge together 
thousands of members of the community in 
sharing the culture of Asia with local Central 
Florida residents, particularly the youth, and 
helping to foster pride, inclusion, and diversity. 
For his work with Asia Trend, Mr. Lau re-
ceived the Ellison S. Onizuka Humanitarian 
Award at the 2010 Asian American Chamber 
of Commerce of Central Florida Golden Drag-
ons Awards. Mr. Lau and Asia Trend work to-
gether with many groups of amazing and pas-
sionate volunteers who come together to edu-
cate, connect and engage the community in 
discussions about Asia’s history, arts, and cul-
tures. 
Ching Ka Lau is also one of the founders of 
CHARGE Dragon Boat Team, the first Asian 
American team to promote the ancient Chi-
nese sport of dragon boating in the community 
for team building, unity, and a healthy lifestyle.

HON. PAUL COOK

Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

cratic Republic of Azerbaijan. 
On May 28, 1918, Azerbaijan gained inde-

came the first secular parliamentary democ-
racy in the Muslim world. Unfortunately, Vladi-

1920 and incorporated it into the Soviet Union 
a few years later. When the Soviet Union col-
lapsed in 1991, Azerbaijan declared independ-
ence and was quickly recognized by the 
United States. 
After restoring diplomatic relations in 1992, 
the United States and Azerbaijan began a 
partnership that has continued to this day. 
Azerbaijanis have fought alongside American 
troops in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq, 
and their country was among the first to ex-
press support for the United States after the 
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 
Azerbaijan has also fostered close ties with 
American allies such as Israel, providing ap-
proximately 40 percent of the oil Israel con-
sumes and partnering on economic and na-
tional security issues. Through its leadership 
in the Southern Gas Corridor initiative, Azer-
baijan plays an important role in diversifying 
energy routes to maintain the energy security 
of key U.S. allies in Europe. As a pluralistic 
and secular Muslim-majority country, Azer-
baijan is also home to thriving Jewish and 
Christian communities. This religious tolerance 
has been recognized by the European Par-
liament. 
I extend my best wishes to all Azerbaijanis 
on this momentous occasion and look forward 
to continued partnership between our two na-
tions.

JERRY FALWELL JR., CORRECT 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, despite fake news reports during the 
Wuhan Virus pandemic from the New York 
Times and the Washington Post parroted by 
other biased media, President Jerry Falwell, 
Jr., of Liberty University has been praised May 
19th by William McGurn in The Wall Street 
Journal: 
How it must hurt to have to admit: Jerry 
Falwell Jr. was right. 
No doubt this explains why we’re not read-
ing stories about how the president of Lib-
erty University kept his Lynchburg, Va., 
campus open while keeping his community 
safe from Covid–19. The doomsday predicted 
when Mr. Falwell announced Liberty stu-
dents would return after spring break never 
came to pass. 
As the Times reported nearly a dozen Lib-
erty students had come down ‘‘with symp-
toms that suggested Covid–19,’’ a fact end-
lessly repeated in other news outlets. A 
snarky 
Financial 
Times 
op-ed 
citing 
‘‘Falwell’s hubris’’ dropped the qualifiers and 
asserted ‘‘twelve students promptly came 
down with coronavirus,’’ which was cor-
rected about a week later. 
In a part of his early statements on Lib-
erty’s reopening that received almost no at-

RECOGNIZING MISS CLEO STEELE 
HON. TOM RICE 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize a very special 
lady, Miss Cleo Steele, founder and President 
of the North Myrtle Beach Republican Club 
and also a very dear friend. 
Cleo’s dedication and invaluable service to 
her community and the Horry County Repub-
lican Party is unparalleled. During her three 
decades in South Carolina, she has worn 
many hats and been a master at each. She is 
a true leader who has been successful in ev-
erything she has tackled. Cleo’s energy and 
tenacity are the envy of those a third the age. 
She never hesitates to tell you what she 
thinks, and I have learned you best listen. Her 
willingness to volunteer and help in any way 
possible epitomizes what it means to be a 
selfless servant. She is an inspiration to all 
that know her and all that know her are better 
for it. 
She has served as the Vice President of the 
Horry County Republican Party, two terms on 
the South Carolina GOP Executive Com-
mittee, and the secretary for my district. Cleo 
has been a county, state, and national alter-
nate delegate to the Republican Party Con-
vention. In all roles, she has demonstrated 
passion for the party’s conservative platform 
and enthusiasm. 
Her presence and leadership in Horry Coun-
ty are irreplaceable. Cleo has been instru-
mental to the successes of the Republican 
Party in Horry County and throughout South 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I join the people of Horry 
County in recognizing Cleo Steele. We honor 
her and thank her for her past and continued 
service to her community and the Nation.

IN HONOR OF HELEN HORLACHER 
EVANS 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mrs. Helen Horlacher Evans. Mrs. 
Evans was born in Fortville, Indiana on June 
11, 1920 and will soon be celebrating her 
100th birthday. 
Mrs. Evans graduated from the University of 
Kentucky and began teaching home econom-
ics at Versailles High School. After conversa-
tions with fellow teachers about the newly 
formed Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps, she 
joined the Army on a dare in 1942. She was 
in the first group of Kentucky women accepted 
for the WAC and at 21 years of age she was 
one of the youngest. She was accepted for 
the Officer Candidate School at Fort Des 
Moines, Iowa. 
Mrs. Evans was trained in army food service 
and served as the Office of the Quartermaster 
General inspector for stateside WAC mess 
halls. In early 1945 she was assigned to the 
European Theatre of Operations with the Of-
fice of the Quartermaster General outside 
Paris, France. At the end of the war she was 
working along the banks of the Rhine feeding 
German prisoners of war. Mrs. Evans earned 
the rank of Captain. Her experience as a WAC 
is documented as part of the Veterans History 
Project in the Library of Congress. 
Upon returning to civilian life, Mrs. Evans 
began work at the Veterans Administration in 
Louisville, KY, where she served as a senior 
training officer until 1951. She has served as 
a volunteer on many projects related to vet-
erans, including serving as Kentucky’s rep-
resentative on the committee to establish the 
National Women’s Memorial at Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery. She received the Spirit of 
Kentucky Award for Patriotism from the Ken-
tucky Daughters of the American Revolution. 
In 2018, she was inducted into the Kentucky 
Veterans Hall of Fame. 
It is my honor to recognize this amazing pa-
triot, celebrate her 100th birthday, and thank 
her for her service and sacrifice to our nation

you, Madam Speaker. I yield back the remain-

CONGRATULATIONS PRESIDENT 
TSAI ING-WEN 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, congratulations to President Tsai 
Ing-wen of Taiwan for beginning a second 
term with a positive message of confidence for 
the future. It is with the affirmation of democ-
racy by President Donald Trump who has pro-
vided advanced weapons to Taiwan to main-
tain Peace Through Strength. 
Taiwan along with Hong Kong are models of 
how people of Chinese heritage can best 
achieve economic prosperity through demo-
cratic free market capitalism. 
The Wall Street Journal published on May 
21st an article by Chun Han Wong entitled 
Taiwan President Holds Firm on China. 
‘‘Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen kicked off 
her second term by doubling down on her 
strategy for boosting the island democracy’s 
ability to resist coercion from China, pledg-
ing 
to 
further 
revamp 
the 
economy, 
strengthen the military and deepen ties with 
friendly countries. 
In her inaugural address on Wednesday, 
Ms. Tsai reiterated Taiwan’s rejection of 
China’s efforts to assimilate the island, 
which Beijing claims as its territory. But she 
offered to work with Chinese leader Xi 
Jinping to stabilize relations in ways that 
respect 
Taiwan’s 
democracy 
and 
sov-
ereignty—conditions that China has pre-
viously rejected. 
‘‘Both sides have a duty to find a way to 
coexist over the long term and prevent the 
intensification 
of 
antagonism 
and 
dif-
ferences,’’ Ms. Tsai said. 
Ms. Tsai won the re-election by a landslide 
in January on a pitch to defend Taiwan’s de-
mocracy by enlarging the island’s inter-
national presence and reducing its economic 
dependence on mainland China, its biggest 
trading partner. 
Taiwan’s standout success in fighting the 
Covid–19 pandemic has bolstered the profile 
of the island of nearly 24 million people, a 
boon for Ms. Tsai’s agenda. Taiwanese au-
thorities had reported 440 coronavirus infec-
tions and seven deaths as of Wednesday.’’

CONGRESSIONAL 
COMMENDATION 
HONORING ASIAN PACIFIC AMER-
ICAN HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. LUCY McBATH 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage 
Month. Each May, Americans commemorate 
two historic anniversaries: the immigration of 
the first Japanese people to the United States 
on May 7, 1843, and the completion of the 
transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869. 
First proposed as a ten-day celebration in 
1977, this month celebrates the heritage of 
Americans who come from Asian and Pacific 
Island countries and territories. Since the first 
Asian and Pacific Islanders made the journey 
to America in 1843, they have enriched the 
fabric of this great nation with their own 
unique contributions. I am honored today to 
tell the stories of two Asian Pacific Americans 
who live and work in Georgia’s Sixth Congres-
sional District. 
Asian Pacific Americans represent a diver-
sity of cultures, experiences, and countries. 
Throughout American history, these men and 
women have contributed to the growth and 
progress of the nation. The story of Asian Pa-
cific Americans has not been without pain, 
however. During the construction of the trans-
continental railroad, thousands of Chinese im-
migrants worked under dangerous conditions, 
endured abusive labor practices, and received 
unfair compensation. During World War II, 
people of Japanese ancestry were removed 
from their homes, imprisoned, and held in des-
olate places without trial. Even today, Asian 
Pacific Americans endure hate and discrimina-
tion simply due to their heritage. Asian-owned 
businesses have suffered during the COVID– 
19 pandemic due to intolerance and xeno-
phobia. As Americans, we must reject and 
condemn such discrimination and embrace the 
many differences that make this community a 
hub of culture and diversity. 
Today, I am proud to celebrate a community 
of Asian Pacific Americans that make up part 
of the incredibly rich and diverse heritage of 
Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. It is my 
honor to recognize two members of this com-
munity in particular: Victoria Huynh and Ching 
Hsia. 
Victoria Huynh is the Vice President of the 
Center for Pan Asian Community Services 
(CPACS), headquartered in Georgia’s Sixth 
District. Victoria’s upbringing in a Vietnamese 
refugee household fuels her passion for com-
munity building, strategic planning, and policy 
work with immigrants and refugees in Georgia. 
She serves as the Advisor of the CPACS’ Ad-
vocacy Department and co-chairs the Asian 
American and Pacific Islander Complete Count 
Committee, which is working to ensure a com-
plete count for Georgia’s Asian Pacific Amer-
ican population in the 2020 Census. Not only 
does Victoria serve on my Sixth District Com-
plete Count Committee, but she also helped 
organize one of the largest ‘‘Get Out the 
Count’’ Census events in the entire state. 
Ching Hsia is the Assistant Principal for the 
Chinese Cultural School and Vice President of 
the Chinese Community Federation of Atlanta. 
She immigrated to the United States with her 
parents and siblings when she was just 8 
years old. As the youngest child among four 
siblings, she watched her parents struggle to 
provide for her family due to language barriers 
and limited employment opportunities. The 
feeling of making her parents proud was what 
kept her going through difficult times. When 
Ching was in middle school, her parents 
bought a restaurant on Buford Highway, which 
is also located in the Sixth District. As the only 
member of her family that spoke English, she 
interpreted mail, bills, and other documents for 
the family business. She went on to attend 
Georgia State University and majored in Span-
ish with a concentration in International Busi-
ness. After college, she used her expertise to 
help her own family business as well as many 
other immigrant-owned businesses along the 
Buford Highway corridor. 
Victoria and Ching’s remarkable stories are 
just two of the many rich narratives that make 
up the vibrant Asian Pacific American commu-
nity in Georgia. I am deeply grateful for the 
services that Victoria and Ching provide to 
residents across the state, and it is my honor 
to highlight them both during Asian Pacific 
American Heritage Month. During this month 
and always, I am proud to celebrate the im-
pact of Asian Pacific Americans here in Geor-
gia and across the country.

RECOGNIZING DR. MATTHEW MAR-
TIN AS CONSTITUENT OF THE 
MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Dr. Matthew Martin, 
a local Army veteran and trauma surgeon at 
Scripps Mercy Hospital, as my Constituent of 
the Month for May. The novel coronavirus has 
swept through our country, leaving devastation 
in its path and particularly hitting the residents 
of New York City. When a colleague reached 
out asking for more hands on deck at the 
Jacobi Medical Center in New York City, Dr. 
Martin did not hesitate to volunteer. 
After five deployments to both Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, Dr. Martin certainly recognizes the 
call to serve. Upon arriving to the front lines of 
America’s coronavirus epicenter, the former 
Army doctor saw a New York City hospital that 
was overwhelmed and overrun. Every day, Dr. 
Martin and his new team risked their own 
health to treat others, even as the virus 
claimed the lives of fellow healthcare workers. 
Despite the hardship he confronted daily, 
Dr. Martin found inspiration in the resolve and 
resilience of his new colleagues and did not 
lose sight of the battle. Since returning to San 
Diego, Dr. Martin brought back with him the 
determination he saw in his New York col-
leagues and a goal to ensure our community 
never experiences the level of devastation he 
found during his time at the Jacobi Medical 
Center. 
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize individuals who have gone 
above and beyond to make our region and our 
country a stronger place for everyone to live 
and thrive. As our nation faces this unprece-
dented health crisis, there are countless first 
responders and essential workers in Califor-
nia’s 49th district who deserve our gratitude 
and recognition. Today, I am proud to recog-
nize Dr. Martin as well as the courageous 
team at the Jacobi Medical Team, whose self-
lessness to join the fight in saving lives is in-
spiring. I am honored to recognize Dr. Mat-
thew Martin as my Constituent of the Month, 
and I thank him not only for his service to our 
country, but also for joining the fight to combat 
this global pandemic.

HONORING 
DR. 
MEHR 
RAHMATULLAH 
AS 
A 
DISTIN-
GUISHED LEADER IN CENTRAL 
FLORIDA FOR ASIAN AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, born in East 
Pakistan, Dr. Mehr Rahmatullah grew up on a 
farmhouse surrounded by coconut trees, cat-
tle, goats and poultry. Growing up, she 
watched her mother volunteer much of her 
time to those in need and became inspired to 
seek a profession in which she could do the 
same. 
While studying medicine at Dow Medical 
University in Karachin, she donated blood fre-
quently to the patients who could not afford 
care. She also worked to transport patients 
from her village to the University Hospital in 
order to be treated by her professors during 
her clinical rotations. As a Medical Officer, she 
volunteered treatment to impoverished pa-
tients with T.B. using her own meager salary 
and enforced a practice of supervising patients 
receiving their medication to ensure that they 
took it. Although she didn’t know at the time, 
this method was actually the now-famous Di-
rectly Observed Therapy (DOT) practice, 
which was made the standard practice for T.B. 
treatment by the World Health Organization. 
She moved to America right after getting mar-
ried in 1988, and soon thereafter prepared for 
the United States Medical Licensing Exam. 
After passing, she completed her first-year 
residency training at St. John’s Mercy in St 
Louis, an affiliate of St Louis University. In her 
second and third year of residency, she 
moved to serve in Internal Medicine at Or-
lando Health in Orlando, Florida. After almost 
25 years into practice and having received 
certification as a Diplomate from the American 
Board of Internal Medicine, Dr. Rahmatullah 
continues to practice as well as volunteer her 
time at Shepard’s Hope Clinic for economically 
disadvantaged patients and serves as an Hon-
orary Member of a local School Board at 
MAGO (Muslim Academy of Greater Orlando). 
She has also served as Chairman of the Cre-
dentials Committee at Osceola Regional Hos-
pital in Kissimmee, Florida.

CONGRATULATING REAR ADMIRAL 
DAVID HAHN ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN 
OF RHODE ISLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to RADM David Hahn, 
U.S. Navy, as he completes a 35-year naval 
career and retires from serving as the Chief of 
Naval Research. 
RADM Hahn was responsible for the oper-
ations of the Naval Research Enterprise, 
which comprises more than 4,000 people in 
23 locations and more than 1,000 partners. 
Over the course of his career, RADM Hahn 
excelled in all facets of being a Naval Officer. 
He served as the commanding officer of the 
USS Pittsburgh and served at sea aboard the 
USS Casimir Pulaski, USS William H. Bates, 
and USS Springfield. Ashore, he served as 
flag lieutenant to Superintendent, U.S. Naval 
Academy; squadron engineer, Submarine De-
velopment Squadron 12; action officer, Joint 
Staff in the Command, Control, Communica-
tions, and Computers (C4) Directorate; and as 
a legislative fellow on the staff of U.S. Senator 
John Warner. 
His vision to create a truly unified Naval Re-
search Enterprise helped align, allocate, and 
accelerate the advancement of knowledge and 
improve the delivery of new capabilities to 
Sailors and Marines. His vision of a dominant 
fighting force now and in the future served as 
an inspiration to the thousands of members of 
the Naval Research Enterprise who directly 
support the warfighter. Reminding all stake-
holders that the Naval Research Enterprise 
mission is ‘‘Future Naval Power,’’ RADM Hahn 
reinvigorated the structure of the Office of 
Naval Research and brought a cohesive vision 
with three key messages: 
Invest in the right scientists to ensure the 
Navy and Marine Corps are always linked to 
scientific discovery. 
Provide a steady infusion of relevant tech-
nology into existing programs of record, and 
Disrupt an adversary’s calculus through inno-
vative capabilities. 
Among his many achievements, Rear Adm. 
Hahn revamped the Future Naval Capabilities 
and Innovative Prototypes processes to more 
effectively and more quickly field new capabili-
ties. Through these efforts, Rear Adm. Hahn 
successfully deployed 20 Future Naval Capa-
bilities and one Innovative Naval Prototype to 
the Navy and Marine Corps, including the 
Navy’s first directed energy weapon system 
onboard the USS Portland (LPD–27). 
His selfless commitment to serving our na-
tion has left us safer and better prepared to 
respond to threats around the world. We wish 
him the very best in retirement after an im-
pressive and impactful career. Fair winds and 
following seas, Admiral Hahn.

FUELING FEARS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, an extraordinary insight has been 
provided by one of South Carolina’s most re-
spected business leaders, Peter Brown in The 
State of Columbia on May 21st. His message 
is valuable to all Americans as we work to-
gether to defeat Wuhan Virus. 
FUELING FEAR ABOUT COVID–19 WILL HINDER 
SC DURING REOPENING 
Back in March our concerns about COVID– 
19 were driven by fears of worst-case sce-
narios: massive infection statistics, high 
mortality rates, overwhelmed hospital sys-
tems and extreme mortality rates. 
Prevention was the goal—and the efforts 
launched sought to flatten the curve of infec-
tions and deaths while reducing the overall 
strain on the health care system. 
CLEAR RESULTS 
And here are the results we’ve seen: 
Expected infection rates, but lower than 
expected levels of hospitalization. 
Lower than expected mortality rates with 
most fatalities occurring among the popu-
lations predicted to be hardest hit: the elder-
ly and those with underlying medical condi-
tions. 
Success in employing personal safety pre-
cautions like social distancing and wearing 
face masks. 
But some things haven’t worked. 
Hospitals and associated medical practices 
suffered dramatic reductions in patients and 
business. Why? Because they had to cancel 
all elective surgeries rather than simply 
staggering them. Meanwhile, ‘‘stay at home’’ 
orders by state and local governments ended 
up sidelining tens of thousands of people, 
forcing them to file for unemployment bene-
fits while also crippling the economy. 
INACCURATE PREDICTIONS 
And through all of this, what we have 
learned is that the virus may be less deadly 
than originally thought. 
The reality is that predictions of poten-
tially millions of deaths from COVID–19 have 
simply been inaccurate—and that high-popu-
lation hotspots like New York, New Jersey 
and Massachusetts make up nearly half of all 
the nationwide cases and deaths. 
In South Carolina the number of new infec-
tions remains manageable, and the percent-
age of new cases versus total cases continues 
to decline even as our testing efforts in-
crease. 
But that’s not what is being reported by 
media outlets, which are desperate for clicks 
and viewers. Every new case of COVID–19 is 
treated as breaking news, and anchors broad-
casting from home is a gimmick that does 
more harm than good. 
SELLING FEAR 
This can’t be the model going forward. 
We have to coexist with COVID–19, and 
that means putting into place realistic, sus-
tainable measures that recognize that until 
the virus is cured, life for those who are 
most at risk will dramatically change. The 
fears of a second wave of COVID–19 are driv-
en by fear rather than data, and they do not 
help us create a sustainable way to coexist 
with the coronavirus. We need to have a real-
istic way to address how to protect those 
most at risk, as well as giving them the tools 
for coping with a ‘‘new normal’’—a reality 
that the rest of society has already started 
to acknowledge by acting responsibly to 
keep infection rates low. Simply put the 
media are selling fear. But the rest of us 
must go on with our lives. The rest of us 
must coexist with this virus. 
LET’S REOPEN 
So it is time to let individuals—who care 
about the people in their families more than 
any government ever will—lead the way 
through cautious responsibility. 
And it is time to let businesses reopen with 
the same degrees of responsible caution so 
that people can earn livelihoods and provide 
futures for their families. 
We should continue to proceed with cau-
tion. 
We should continue to practice social dis-
tance. 
We should continue to wear face masks. 
We should be willing to stay at home if we 
are not comfortable with the pace of reopen-
ing our state. 
But we should reopen united as one.

passed away on April 1, 2020 at the age of 
90. He was a well-known advocate in the 
Fresno, California community and a role 
model for many in the Central Valley. A true 
trailblazer, Floyd and his brother James were 
the first African American fire fighters in the 
City of Fresno. 
Floyd White, Sr. was born in Oklahoma; he 
and his family moved to Fresno, California 
when he was young. He excelled in sports 
and academics at Edison High School and 
Fresno City College, playing football and run-
ning track and field. Floyd was a veteran of 
the United States Army, serving in the Korean 
War and earning the rank of Sergeant. 
On September 1, 1954, Floyd White, Sr. 
and brother, James White made history as the 
first African American firefighters in the City of 
Fresno. Floyd would make history as Fresno’s 
very 
first 
African 
American 
Fire 
Chief. 
Throughout his career, he fought for equal 
rights, higher education, and fair employment 
for all. Floyd won a historic lawsuit against the 
City of Fresno for racial discrimination along-
side Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NOR-
TON, then Commissioner of the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission. During his time 
in the force, he was mentor to young African 
American fire fighters and made sure they had 
an ally to turn to. He truly had a passion for 
standing up for what is right and helping oth-
ers during times of need. 
Floyd dedicated much of his time to the 
community he loved dearly. He was an hon-
orary Deacon of Saint Rest Baptist Church 
and was past Commander of the American 
Legion Post 511. Floyd was a lifetime member 
of The Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and an Eter-
nal member with Highest Honors of the 33rd 
Degree Free Masons Raisin City Lodge Num-
ber Five. Following his retirement from the 
Fresno Fire Department, Floyd was sure to 
stay busy. He became a business owner, 
worked as a corrections officer, substitute 
teacher and bus driver. 
He is survived by his beloved wife, Whelma 
Jean White; sons Floyd L. White, Jr. and 
Cedric W. White, Sr.; and daughters Carolyn 
J. White, Jennifer L. White, Rae L. White and 
Donzetta White Hale. He also leaves behind 
his brother James Porter White, sister-in-law 
Joyful White, and many nieces, nephews, 
grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and loving 
friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to join me in

After immigrating to the United States in 1968, 
he began teaching the Wah Lum Kung Fu 
System in Boston, MA. In 1980, he moved the 
headquarters of the Wah Lum System to Or-
lando, FL where he built the first kung fu tem-
ple in the United States, the Wah Lum Tem-
ple. 
He was the first person to begin the tradition 
of Chinese New Year celebrations in Central 
Florida and used these events as an oppor-
tunity to educate his community on the Chi-
nese culture. Grandmaster Chan has been 
featured in magazines and documentaries for 
his revered style and prowess in the martial 
arts industry. Most notably, his life is captured 
in a documentary directed by his daughter ti-
tled Pui Chan: Kung Fu Pioneer. Along with 
this documentation of his work, his skill and 
prowess are also exemplified through his in-
ductions in several martial arts Halls of Fame. 
In 
addition 
to 
his 
many 
accolades, 
Grandmaster Chan has also trained a profes-
sional demonstration team that performs at all 
the major theme parks in Central Florida. 
Through his philanthropic efforts, he has 
raised over $30,000 for St. Jude Children’s 
Research Hospital. 
Recognized 
and 
esteemed 
by 
many, 
Grandmaster Chan has been an integral part 
of contributing to and preserving martial arts 
knowledge in the world. Of all his endeavors 
and accomplishments, most important to him 
is his love for his family, his pride in his stu-
dents, and his whole-hearted practice of his 
system’s motto of integrating respect, kind-
ness, fellowship, and strength in martial arts. 
In his life, actions, and practice of martial arts, 
his philosophy is evident, it’s not just a job, but 
a way of life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SAMITA 
JACOBS 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Samita 
Baumritter Jacobs. Sookie, as she was known, 
passed away at her home on April 27, 2020 
at the age of 89. Throughout her extraordinary 
life, I am told she spread her unique warmth, 
spirit, goodness, and generosity to all who 
were lucky enough to know her. 
The 
daughter 
of 
Ted 
and 
Florence 
Baumritter, Sookie grew up in New York City. 
After being set up on a blind date with Howard 
Jacobs, it soon became clear that they were 
soulmates. Sookie and Howard married on 
June 5, 1952, and for the next 63 years they 
were partners in everything. 
After starting a family in New York, Sookie 
and Howard moved their young children to 
southern California so they could start their 
own furniture business. Sookie was the aes-
thetic force in the endeavor while Howard han-
dled the business side. With their complemen-
tary talents and temperaments, their one 
Ethan Allen store soon turned to five—and 
they were known for their excellence, value, 
and integrity. Customers and staff not only re-
spected Sookie, they loved her. 
Nothing was more important to Sookie than 
being with her family, and she cherished trips 
and visits with her children and their families. 
In their later years, Sookie and Howard moved 
to Rancho Santa Fe in the 49th Congressional 
District to be closer to their daughter Ami and 
her family. Sookie’s devotion to Howard knew 
no bounds, caring for Howard’s every need 
through his declining health and difficult bout 
with Alzheimer’s. 
Sookie taught her family by example that a 
glass could be half full. She faced numerous 
health challenges in her life. When she had 
her first bout with cancer in the late 1970s, the 
doctors gave her a less than 10 percent 
chance of living for more than three years. 
She made up her mind quickly that she was 
going to be one of the 10 percent. Her cour-
age and determination were simply inspira-
tional. Throughout her life she met every chal-
lenge with her fierce determination and loving 
care for those around her.

CONGRATULATING BULGARIAN 
SUCCESS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as Co-Chair of the Congressional 
Bulgaria Caucus, I commend the government 
of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov for its han-
dling of the unprecedented Wuhan Virus pan-
demic. After a state of emergency declaration 
lasting ten weeks, the Bulgarian government 
announced on Tuesday that the country’s 
famed archeological treasures, monasteries, 
mountain havens along with world-class Black 
Sea resorts, marinas, sports centers, res-
taurants, bars, and cafes will reopen on June 
1st. 
As of this week, Bulgaria has reported 2,460 
confirmed coronavirus cases, including 133 
deaths, a relatively low number for Europe. 
Prime Minister Borissov and Health Minister 
Kiril Ananiev started relaxing the lockdown 
back in April, while still enforcing strict social 
distancing and other important measures 
which succeeded in containing the spread of 
the Invisible Enemy. 
The Bulgarian government deserves high 
praise for its handling of this unique public 
health crisis and for exhibiting an impressive 
level of leadership in the face of this chal-
lenge. The American people will continue to 
stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of 
Bulgaria, and we look forward to seeing our 
friends in Sofia in better days with warm Bul-
garian hospitality. 
Bulgaria is ably represented in Washington 
with Ambassador Tihomir Stoychev who is 
serving in the tradition of Ambassador Elena 
Poptodorova.

Muslim East. Though it was absorbed into the 
Soviet Union in 1920, Azerbaijan again de-
clared its independence seven decades later 
in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. 
Azerbaijan’s Republic Day serves as a time 
to highlight and reflect on some of the coun-
try’s best qualities, including its strong relation-
ship with Israel, its focus on energy security, 
and its key role in regional stability. 
A Muslim-majority country, Azerbaijan also 
hosts a thriving, secure Jewish community, 
and the Azerbaijan-Israel bilateral relationship 
is strong. 
Additionally, Azerbaijan is committed to pro-
tecting global energy security, especially 
through its efforts regarding the Southern Gas 
Corridor, which will decrease the Caspian re-
gion’s dependence on Russian oil. 
A stalwart U.S. ally, Azerbaijan has aided 
U.S. and NATO forces by providing critical re-
fueling stations, and Azerbaijan’s troops have 
fought side-by-side with U.S. troops in Afghan-
istan. In addition, Azerbaijan has contributed 
to the security of Kosovo and Iraq and sup-
ports peacekeeping operations under the 
United Nations and NATO. Azerbaijan is also 
committed to global nonproliferation efforts 
and participates as a member of the Organiza-
tion for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
Azerbaijan is a significant U.S. partner in a 
strategically important area of the world, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me to commending 
the people of Azerbaijan on their Republic 
Day.

Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of, and express sad-
ness over, the passing of an extraordinary 
woman, Elmira ‘‘Nana’’ V. Gilbert: Elmira 
moved to West Palm Beach, Florida when she 
was five years old and lived there for nearly

Elmira was an extremely resilient woman 
having survived the many injustices of seg-
regation and numerous hurricanes, including 
the deadly hurricane of 1928. I extend my 
heartfelt condolences to Elmira’s many family 
members and friends. Our nation grieves with 
you, and I pray that you may find comfort dur-
ing this extremely difficult time.

Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity has proven 
itself of serving the community as we all work 
to defeat the Wuhan virus. The Aiken Stand-
ard on May 25th in an article by Matthew 
Enfinger presented the following acts of kind-
ness. A presentation photo highlighted frater-
nity members Ray Williams, Everett Chandler, 
Anthony White, and Will Jones. Fraternity 
buys lunch for Aiken police Officers. 
‘‘In an effort to show support and thanks to 
local police, Aiken Omega Psi Phi chapter pro-
vided lunch to officers at the Aiken Depart-
ment Public Safety on Thursday. 
Around noon, members of the local chapter 
carried boxes of food and drinks provided by 
Chick-Fil-A in Aiken. [Owned by Tom Johnson] 
Ray Williams with the Sigma Pi chapter of 
Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., said it’s a way 
to give back to area officers who work daily to 
keep Aiken safe. 
In addition to serving Public Safety, another 
group from the fraternity served lunch to We 
Care Nursing Home in New Ellenton. 
‘‘We wanted to show some support for our 
Aiken Public Safety by providing them lunch 
because they’re putting themselves out on the 
line every day to protect and serve us regard-
less of the COVID–19 pandemic, ‘‘They’re still 
out there doing our best to keep us safe.’’ 
Chief Charles Barranco with ADPS said the 
support from the community through lunches 
and simple thank you’s has meant a lot to the 
law enforcement division. 
‘‘We’re part of the community and when the 
community partners with us it’s pretty cool to 
see the engagement especially when there’s a 
fire call or police call going on,’’ Barranco said. 
‘‘Many groups, such as the Omegas, have 
been part of COVID–19 response and we’re 
very thankful.’’

HONORING THE LIFE OF ARTIST 
MARGARET HUDSON 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
along with my colleague, Mr. TJ COX to honor 
and pay tribute to the life of local artist Mar-
garet Hudson, who passed away on February 
2, 2020 at the age of 93. Her iconic clay 
sculptures of California wildlife and young chil-
dren were loved for generations. 
Margaret Metzler was born to David and 
Sadie Metzler in Fresno, California. From a 
young age, Margaret enjoyed spending time 
outdoors with animals at her parent’s home in 
Fresno’s Old Fig Garden neighborhood. She 
and her family also loved hiking and camping, 
especially in Sequoia National Park. Her ap-
preciation of the Central Valley’s beautiful 
landscape grew from a young age, which 
would later influence her art. 
Margaret attended college in New England 
and studied art and theology. She would go 
on to serve as a missionary in Japan for sev-
eral years. Margaret met and married her hus-
band Gilbert Hudson in 1955 and shortly after 
moved to South Korea as missionaries. Gilbert 
taught physics, and Margaret taught English, 
at the University of Daegu. They had four 
sons in South Korea and lived there until 
1967. 
After returning to the United States, the 
Hudson family lived in various parts of the 
country. Her love for art blossomed when liv-
ing in New York, where she first began to ex-
periment with materials such as decaying barn 
wood and automotive trims. In Maryland, she 
began working with red clay. Margaret finally 
found her style of art in red clay and began 
sculpting from her memories of South Korea. 
In 1968, the family moved to Coalinga, Cali-
fornia, but after her husband became ill with 
Valley Fever, they moved to Fresno to be 
closer to family. Margaret realized after Gil-
bert’s recovery that she would need to help 
support the family financially. In 1972, she de-
cided to open a business, Earth Art’s Studio 
and became one of the first female arts entre-
preneurs in Fresno. 
In 1988, Margaret lost her father, son, and 
mother within one year. She used art as her 
therapy and created pieces that were much 
larger than her original work. After 20 years of 
working with clay, Margaret attended Fresno 
City College to expand her artistic abilities to 
include paint. In 1992, she went to London 
and Paris and was inspired to paint on can-
vas. That same year, Margaret held her first 
art show. 
Margaret’s artwork is a fixture throughout 
the Central Valley. Her ‘‘Mama Bear’’ sculp-
ture is displayed at Valley Children’s Hospital,

Chaffee Zoo. Her clay sculptures are a staple

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
us in recognizing the life of Margaret Hudson. 
Her artwork continues to inspire and is a cher-
ished part of life in the valley. We join her 
family, friends, and members of the commu-
nity in honoring her great life.

REMEMBERING JAMES J. ‘‘JIM’’ 
LOFTUS, JR. 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor the life 
of James J. ‘‘Jim’’ Loftus, Jr., a member of the 
‘‘Greatest Generation’’, who recently passed 
away in Pleasanton. 
Jim was born in 1924 in San Francisco. He 
attended high school in Alameda, graduating 
from St. Joseph Notre Dame High School in 
1942. Like so many he answered the call to 
service following the attack on our country, en-
listing in the United States Marine Corps 
(USMC) in December of that year. 
During World War II he worked as a me-
chanic. His service took him to action in the 
New Hebrides Islands, Solomon Islands, Kwaj-
alein, and Peleliu, prior to his discharge in Oc-
tober 1945. 
In 1947, Jim married the love of his life, 
Mary, joined the USMC Reserve Signal Bat-
talion in Alameda, got a job as a lineman at 
the PAC Bell phone company, and settled in 
San Francisco. He had two young children be-
fore his country called on him once more. 
His unit was called up in July 1950, and he 
was sent to fight in Korea. There he worked 
as a field radio operator and was attached to 
combat units going from Inchon to Chosin, 
which truly put him in harm’s way. 
Following his discharge Jim returned to Cali-
fornia and his job at PAC Bell. He eventually 
rose to the level of supervisor before retiring 
after 35 years with the company. 
Jim was an active member of the St. Vin-
cent de Paul Society and the Catholic par-
ishes in which he lived. He also very much en-
joyed gardening and traveling, especially to 
see members of his family. 
Jim and Mary had six children. He is pre-
ceded in death by his wife, Mary, and son 
James J. Lotus III. He is survived by five 
daughters—Jeanne O’Brien, Teresa Loftus, 
Rosemary Back, Eileen Manger, and Julie 
Trudell, as well as 13 grandchildren and four 
great-grandchildren. 
Jim constantly gave of himself—to his 
friends, his family, and his country. He will be 
deeply missed, and my deepest condolences 
go out to his friends and loved ones.

MENT 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Thad Thome for his 
retirement from the United States Army after 
over 20 years of service. 
LTC Thome’s record of service with the U.S. 
Army is truly impressive. He began his career 
after enlisting in 1989 by working in the 103rd 
Military Intelligence Battalion. He ended his 
enlisted service in 1992 as a Sergeant. LTC 
Thome earned his commission in 2000 and 
served with the 2nd Battalion, 37th Armored 
Regiment in Friedberg, Germany. After which, 
he deployed to Iraq in support of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and from 2006 to 2007 
to advise intelligence personnel. 
LTC Thome deployed as the Deputy J2 for 
CJTF–10 in Afghanistan during operations 
from 2014 to 2015, which brought the combat 
phase of U.S. operations to a close and began 
a new phase of Operation Resolute Support. 
He also served in the CENTCOM J2 Oper-
ations Division as the Global Force Manage-
ment Team Lead, frequently traveling to Ku-
wait, Qatar, and Afghanistan from 2015 to 
2017 to support combat deployed HQs with 
critical 
Intelligence 
personnel 
support 
to 
counter strength issues. LTC Thome’s con-
tributions to U.S. Army and Joint Forces Intel-
ligence throughout his career ensured suc-
cessful operations and the national defense of 
our nation. 
Originally from Rapid City, LTC Thome is a 
native South Dakotan and I am proud to have 
such an exceptional servicemember call South 
Dakota home. Our state and country are bet-
ter because of citizens like him. I thank LTC 
Thome and his family for their tremendous 
sacrifice, and I extend my deepest congratula-
tions for his retirement.

HONORING COLONEL THOMAS G. 
FALZARANO 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Colonel Thomas G. 
Falzarano, USAF, who passed away on May 
12, 2020 after a lifetime of distinguished serv-
ice to his country. Colonel Falzarano was a 
devoted husband, a caring father, a leader of 
character, and a champion for our nation’s 
ideals. 
Thomas G. Falzarano was born September 
20, 1972 in Nashua, New Hampshire to 
George 
Marshall 
and 
Joan 
Denise 
(Campagnone) Falzarano. Growing up with 
five siblings meant that he had to hone his 
competitive spirit and leadership skills early. 
Such skills prompted him to seek an appoint-
ment to the United States Air Force Academy, 
which he acquired. 
His career in the Air Force shaped Colonel 
Falzarano’s personal leadership style. His 
three R’s (Respect, Readiness, and Responsi-
bility) complimented the service values of the 
Air Force. His embodiment of these character-
istics was seen in every sphere of his life. 
None more prevalent, however, than the rela-
tionship that he had with his wife Stacey and 
children Trevor, Spencer, Michael, Thomas, 
and Valentina. 
Competence in every aspect of the profes-
sion of arms is a moral obligation for those ac-
cepting a commission. For those under his 
command, Colonel Falzarano set the example 
of virtue, honor, patriotism, and service. He 
did not take lightly the responsibility of men-
toring, inspiring, and challenging the sons and 
daughters entrusted to him. His strategic as-
signments and personal decorations after

graduating the Air Force Academy in 1994 
speak to his proficiency and exemplary per-
formance as an Officer. 
His personal decorations and career ad-
vancement paled in comparison, however, to 
the pride he exhibited when speaking about 
the Airman he was fortunate enough to lead. 
He met with spouses and families throughout 
the 21st Space Wing—ensuring their voices 
and concerns were heard. He took time to 
mentor Airmen under his charge; he listened 
to squadron commanders, group commanders 
and first sergeants in order to fully understand 
the needs and concerns of the Airmen. Re-
gardless of rank, he met and followed up with 
every individual seeking his expertise. 
He embodied the aspects of servant leader-
ship. He made it a point to learn the job of ev-
eryone under his command so that, when the 
time came, he could advocate on their behalf. 
This included standing shoulder to shoulder 
with Airmen of the 21st Civil Engineer Squad-
ron filling potholes, shadowing security forces 
throughout his area of operations, suiting up 
with EOD to participate in a bomb simulation; 
meeting with the space operators from the 
10th Space Warning Squadron and the many 
Air Force civilians that made the mission pos-
sible. He took time to speak with, listen to, 
and thank everyone from the commissary 
bagger staff to the public affairs team that al-
lowed his Airmen to focus on their task at 
hand. Colonel Falzarano believed that the en-
tire 21st Space Wing family had a role to play, 
and if he could invest in the lives of those 
under his charge, the Airmen would have ex-
ponential success in their mission. He was a 
Commander that understood the impact his 
physical presence had on the units he led and 
made the well-being of his Airmen a priority. 
Through his character, competence, and 
leadership, he made a difference in the lives 
of everyone with whom he came in contact. 
Colonel Falzarano’s positive impact throughout 
the enlisted, commissioned, and civilian ranks 
will have a ripple effect on Air Force leader-
ship for generations to come. It was a privi-
lege to have met Colonel Falzarano and it is 
an honor to recognize his incredible life.

Chamber of Commerce held its first monthly 
without members or breakfast, but by vir-
tual means. Sponsored by Burr Foreman 
McNair, their message was ‘‘how pandemic 
has affected minds of your potential cus-
tomers, their thoughts on travel, eating out, 
and overall concerns and more.’’ The basic 
overall thought is we have experienced 
change in every part of our life, and we are 
living in unprecedented times. 
Even though concerned about the un-
known, it is encouraging that consumers 
seem to be embracing the new normal. They 
are confident about getting back to work 
and life with safe practices. 
Chernoff Newman gave all important in-
sights and data on this new lifestyle in 
which we are living. 
It appears much travel will be within our 
state or country rather than abroad. This 
places change in our tourism industry. It 
was very informative program.

AZERBAIJAN’S 102ND REPUBLIC 
DAY 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, May 28, 
2020 marks Azerbaijan’s 102nd Republic Day, 
the day on which the country became the first 
Muslim-majority 
secular 
democratic 
state. 
Since regaining its independence following the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan has 
proven itself a partner of the United States 
particularly in its commitment to regional sta-
bility and security cooperation. 
As someone who has traveled to Israel 
nineteen times and championed the cause of 
the U.S.-Israeli friendship since first coming to 
the House, I applaud Azerbaijan’s commitment 
to ensuring that the Azeri and Israeli people 
remain good friends. Indeed, home to a thriv-
ing Jewish community of around 30,000, Azer-
baijan is one of the few countries with a pre-
dominately 
Muslim 
population 
that 
is 
a 
staunch supporter of Israel. 
Azerbaijan is also committed to regional se-
curity and stability. With its dedication to coun-
tering terrorism and nuclear proliferation, its 
support for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and its 
contributions to UN and NATO peacekeeping 
missions, Azerbaijan continues to contribute to 
the stabilization of the region. 
Madam Speaker, although friends will have 
difficult conversations at times, those discus-
sions are based in honesty and respect. 
Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating the people of Azerbaijan on their 
Republic Day.

IN 
SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
FINDLAY 
BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
TOP MICROPOLITAN COMMUNITY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Findlay, Ohio for being recognized as 
the Top Micropolitan Community in the United 
States for the sixth year in a row. The issuing 
magazine, Site Selection, announced the 2020 
award by describing Findlay as ‘‘being pro-
pelled into superstar status.’’ 
In order to be considered a micropolitan 
city, the area must have a population ranging 
from 10,000 to 50,000. Over 550 of these cit-
ies were evaluated on business growth and 
economic sustainability. Findlay was able to 
secure this award for the sixth year in a row 
because of their focus on residential develop-
ments in 2019 that met Site Selection’s cri-
teria. 
Fostering a cooperative environment be-
tween businesses and local government has 
allowed for continued economic growth in 
Findlay. Over the past six years, 1,000 new 
jobs have been created in Findlay alone. This 
success would not be possible without the 
partnership and cooperation between the Find-
lay government, the Findlay-Hancock County 
Economic Development office, the Hancock 
County Commissioners, and the entire Findlay 
community. 
Madam Speaker, Findlay has routinely 
served as an example of what a strong com-
munity and a commitment to its prosperity can 
do by implementing their renowned ‘‘Findlay 
Formula.’’ This formula continues to pay divi-
dends and serves as an example to cities 
across the country. 
I congratulate Findlay for another year as 
the Nation’s top-ranked Micropolitan Commu-
nity.

Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Dr. Ejaz

INTRODUCTION OF THE FARM TO 
FRIDGE ACT OF 2020 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the introduction of my bill—The 
Farm to Fridge Act of 2020. 
As a result of the COVID–19 pandemic, res-
taurants across the country have been forced 
to close—and as a result, many farmers have 
been unable to sell their food. This has dra-
matically 
disrupted 
incomes 
and 
supply

chains, and resulted in food waste. Mean-
while, families across the country are strug-
gling to find new ways to purchase affordable 
food beyond grocery stores as they adhere to 
social distancing and experience disrupted 
food supplies. 
In the face of COVID–19, farmers are eager 
to pivot from selling to restaurants wholesale 
to selling direct-to-consumer, but in order to 
do so, they need expensive machinery and 
marketing funds to make this transition. At the 
same time, merchants need support to expand 
direct producer-to-consumer markets to help 
communities access locally- and regionally- 
produced agriculture. All the while, consumers 
are eager to purchase food products locally 
and regionally. 
The Farm to Fridge Act would bridge all 
these entities by expanding two existing pro-
grams for efforts to diversify farms’ and mer-
chants’ customer bases: the Value Added Pro-
ducer Grant program and the Farmers Market 
and Local Food Promotion Program. Both of 
these programs will ultimately inject necessary 
capital to help both farmers and merchants to 
close gaps in our supply chain, supplement in-
come to farmers, and increase food access for 
families. 
I thank my colleague, Representative FRED 
UPTON, for introducing this important, bipar-
tisan measure and urge my colleagues to sup-
port it. After all, during this coronavirus pan-
demic, the last thing families should worry 
about is access to food.

NATIONAL GUARD SELFLESS 
SERVICE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, this week, almost six-hundred mem-
bers of the South Carolina National Guard are 
on Active Duty Orders, selflessly serving their 
fellow citizens to combat the effects of the 
Wuhan Virus and provide help to South Caro-
linians. There service is made possible by the 
steadfast resolve of South Carolina’s Governor 
Henry McMaster and Adjutant General, Major 
General Van McCarty. As a grateful 31-year 
veterans myself of the National Guard with 
three Guard sons—Alan, Field Artillery, who 
served in Iraq, Julian, Signal, who served in 
Egypt, and Hunter, Engineer, who served in 
Afghanistan. I especially appreciate Guard 
service. 
During this challenging time, it is inspiring to 
witness so many National Guard Service men 
and women choose to help their communities. 
Here are a few of South Carolina’s citizens 
who choose to serve in the National Guard, 
combating the Wuhan Virus. 
Captain Daniel Nix, of Chapin, is Military 
Police Officer in the South Carolina Army Na-
tional Guard. Captain Nix has supported over 
one-hundred missions throughout South Caro-
lina’s Joint Task Force in support of Wuhan 
Virus operations. 
Master Sergeant Michael Keene, of Colum-
bia, is a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, 
and Nuclear Specialist, and has supported 
over one-hundred missions in South Carolina. 
Specialist William Stout, of Gaston, and 
Mikayla Battersby, of Lexington, are combat 
medics in the South Carolina Army National 
Guard. Between the two of them, they have 
screened almost one-thousand people in sup-
port of relief operations. 
Staff Sergeant Jennifer Heller, of Lexington, 
is a medical specialist in the South Carolina 
Air National Guard. Staff Sergeant Heller has 
screened over three-hundred people in sup-
port of ongoing operations. 
Captain Stephen Zagorski, of Irmo, and 
Second Lieutenant Cullen Parrott, of Chapin, 
provide their expertise to help fellow citizens. 
Captain Zagorski is a Field Artillery Officer in 
the South Carolina Army National Guard and 
has planned and supported over one-hundred 
missions throughout the State. Second Lieu-
tenant Parrott is an Ordnance Officer in the 
South Carolina Army National Guard and has 
supported over fifty missions that delivered im-
portant supplies to South Carolinians across 
the State. 
Sergeant Elizabeth Hicks, of Lexington, is a 
supply sergeant in the South Carolina Army 
National Guard. Her efforts have positively im-
pacted Soldiers and citizens. She organized 
and ensured the delivery of food and water to 
over five-hundred National Guards Service 
men and women, to include local citizens. 
Major Michael Morris, of Lexington, serves 
in an important role as a human resources of-
ficer. Through Major Morris’ adept organiza-
tional skills and positive leadership traits, he 
supported over one-hundred relief missions 
throughout South Carolina to aid in the fight 
against the Wuhan Virus. 
First Lieutenant Brittany McKoy, of Gaston, 
and Staff Sergeant Christopher Rice, of Lex-
ington, assisted numerous Service Members 
and fellow citizens in South Carolina. Between 
the two of these great American citizens, 
they’ve supported almost one-hundred service 
and relief missions, in response to the Wuhan 
Virus. 
Colonel Timothy Wood, of Columbia, is a 
Logistics Officer in the South Carolina Army 
National Guard. His efforts have positively im-
pacted citizens throughout the state as he has 
tirelessly planned and coordinated over two- 
hundred missions throughout the State. 
I am grateful for the leadership of Governor 
McMaster, Major General Van McCarty, and 
these men and women who choose to serve 
our Nation. It is important to recognize their 
achievements. God Bless our Troops and let 
us never forget the terrorist attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001.

IN HONOR OF THE UPCOMING 
RETIREMENT OF PETER M. HAYES 
HON. FRED UPTON 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 27, 2020 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the extraordinary career and out-
standing public service of my dear friend, 
Peter M. Hayes. I would like to congratulate 
Peter on his upcoming retirement which is 
well-deserved. 
During the Reagan Administration, I got to 
know Peter when he served as the Special 
Assistant to the Assistant Secretary for Water 
and Science at the U.S. Depaitment of Inte-
rior, and was the Deputy Director of Congres-
sional Liaison for two Secretaries of the Inte-
rior. During that time, I was working at OMB 
with David Stockman and we shared some 
great personal and professional experiences 
as we began our careers in Washington, D.C. 
This bond of friendship formed in those years 
has only strengthened and grown. 
In 1985, Peter joined the Salt River Project 
(SRP), the nation’s third-largest public power 
utility and the largest supplier of water to the 
greater Phoenix metropolitan area. SRP pro-
vides water and electricity to more than 2 mil-
lion people in metropolitan Phoenix and is one 
of the largest raw water suppliers in Arizona, 
managing an extensive system of dams, res-
ervoirs, wells, canals, and irrigation laterals. 
In a career that spanned four decades in 
the private and public sector, Peter was a 
leader in public policy and brought vision to a 
wide array of energy and water issues that 
helped Arizona. He played a critical role in the 
negotiations on Capitol Hill and with the Presi-
dent George H.W. Bush administration during 
the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which 
led to scrubbers being installed on the Navajo 
Generation Station. During his tenure as Asso-
ciate General Manager, Peter worked to sup-
port many issues in futherance of Arizona’s 
economy, including the expansion of public 
education, the development of the Valley’s 
transportation systems, and the infrastructure 
to support Arizona’s sports and tourism indus-
try. 
Peter’s business and community leadership 
included terms as Chairman of the Greater 
Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, a Board 
member of the Arizona Chamber of Com-
merce, a Trustee of the Arizona Science Cen-
ter, a member of the Dean’s Advisory Board of 
the ASU Barrett Honors College, and a mem-
ber of the Arizona Commission on the Arts. 
His commitment to education and the prin-
ciples of American democracy led him to lead 
the Sandra Day O’Connor Institute as Chair-
man of the Board and worked to establish the 
Institute as the nation’s premier civics edu-
cation organization. 
In addition to his many contributions to pub-
lic service, Peter is a devoted husband, father 
and grandfather. He and his wife Lynn live in 
Phoenix, though look forward to spending 
more time in Pinetop. With humor, charm, 
goodwill and vision, Peter has been a great 
friend, and he has been a leader to those who 
seek to make Arizona and the United States 
a better place. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize 
the leadership of Peter M. Hayes and com-
mend him for his service to the Salt River 
Project, Arizona and the United States.
