Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, APRIL 20, 2020 
No. 74 
House of Representatives 
The House was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Tuesday, April 21, 2020, at 10:30 a.m. 
Senate 
MONDAY, APRIL 20, 2020 
The Senate met at 2 and 3 seconds 
p.m. and was called to order by the 
Honorable MICHAEL B. ENZI, a Senator 
from the State of Wyoming.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
The legislative clerk read the fol-
lowing letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, April 20, 2020. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable MICHAEL B. ENZI, a 
Senator from the State of Wyoming, to per-
form the duties of the Chair. 
CHUCK GRASSLEY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. ENZI thereupon assumed the 
Chair as Acting President pro tempore.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to be recog-
nized, notwithstanding the order for a 
pro forma session today. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it 
has now been 4 days since the Pay-
check Protection Program ran out of 
money. Republicans have been trying 
to secure more funding for this critical 
program for a week and a half now. At 
this hour, our Democratic colleagues 
are still prolonging their discussions 
with the administration, so the Senate 
regretfully will not be able to pass 
more funding for Americans’ paychecks 
today. 
However, since this is so urgent, I 
have asked that the Senate meet again 
tomorrow in a new session that was not 
previously scheduled, and the Demo-
cratic leader has agreed to my request. 
Colleagues, it is past time—past 
time—to get this done for the country. 
Mr. President, if I may, the Senator 
desires to speak for a few minutes. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Washington is 
recognized. 
f 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am 
here this afternoon to speak about the 
critical aspect of the paycheck act as it 
relates to businesses, particularly in 
the newspaper and broadcasting busi-
ness. It is so important for us to ad-
dress this issue because these are the 
people who are on the frontlines deliv-
ering the information to us about this 
crisis. 
Unfortunately, in the past legisla-
tion, we did not include associations of 
broadcasters and newspapers under the 
definition, so up to several thousand 
newspapers and hundreds of local radio 
and television stations across the coun-
try are without existing programs by 
the small business affiliation rule to 
assist these companies in keeping im-
portant news print and news broad-
casting staff at their jobs. 
When I think about what I have 
learned about the coronavirus from 
these individuals, what I have learned 
about the broadcast information of 
nursing home problems, what I have 
learned about issues with Remdesivir, I 
all know that it came down to the local 
media who was telling us about it. So 
when I think of the headlines I am see-
ing—the LA Times, ‘‘Coronavirus crisis 
hastens the collapse of local news-
papers.’’; 
‘‘Long-Struggling 
Local 
Newspapers Pushed to Brink Brought 
by Coronavirus’’—I know it is time for 
us to do something to help these indi-
viduals, and I hope that we can do that 
soon. 
We need the media—the local small 
media—to help us continue to commu-
nicate. After all, the basis of a democ-
racy is about truth and transparency, 
and they are helping to build a commu-
nity of truth and transparency. We 
need to help them during this crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader.
