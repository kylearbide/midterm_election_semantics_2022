RECOGNIZING HEROES AND 
VICTIMS IN COLLIERVILLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Madam Speaker, last 
week, our community in Collierville, 
Tennessee, experienced a horrific trag-
edy. 
On Thursday, September 23, last 
week, a gunman opened fire at the 
Kroger on Byhalia Road. Fifteen people 
were shot, and one woman, Olivia King, 
a mother and grandmother, died as a 
result of her injuries in the hospital 
later that day. 
Roberta and I are praying for Olivia 
King’s children, her family, and her 
friends at this difficult time. 
As Collierville Alderman Maureen 
Fraser said: ‘‘Everybody needs to be 
more like Olivia King. She was very 
kind, very generous, very Christian, 
and a rule-follower.’’ 
Our hearts go out to all the victims, 
their loved ones, and everyone in the 
entire community who has been im-
pacted. 
I want to quote Collierville Police 
Chief 
Dale 
Lane, 
who 
said 
that 
Collierville is ‘‘one of the most resil-
ient communities in America.’’ I be-
lieve that this is an absolutely true 
statement. 
On that tragic day, we witnessed our 
brave heroes—law enforcement offi-
cers, 
Federal 
agents, 
firefighters, 
EMTs, doctors, nurses, and other local 
officials—spring into action. Not a sin-
gle person hesitated to act or tend to a 
person in need. 
Their training and selfless actions 
helped save people’s lives that day. 
There is no doubt about it. I cannot 
thank enough everyone for their in-
credible bravery and courage that day. 
The collaboration and cooperation 
between all the law enforcement agen-
cies and all the first responders was 
tremendous. These agencies included: 
the Collierville Police Department; the 
Collierville 
Fire 
Department; 
the 
Shelby County Sheriff’s Office; the 
Germantown Police Department; the 
Germantown 
Fire 
Department; 
the 
Memphis Police Department; the Mem-
phis Fire Department; the Bartlett 
Fire Department; the Bartlett Police 
Department; the Fayette County Sher-
iff’s Office; the DeSoto County, Mis-
sissippi, Sheriff’s Office; the Tennessee 
Highway Patrol; the FBI; and other 
Federal 
law 
enforcement 
agencies. 
They worked flawlessly together to ad-
dress and handle the situation in a 
timely and professional manner. 
I also commend Collierville Police 
Chief Dale Lane’s strong and effective 
leadership, and I thank his entire staff 
for their heroism. Special commenda-
tion also goes to Collierville Fire Chief 
Buddy Billings and his men and women 
for their swift action that prevented 
the additional loss of life. 
Further, I want to recognize all the 
first responders, the doctors, the sur-
geons, the nurses, and their staff for 
delivering the necessary and imme-
diate care to these victims. 
Lastly, I would like to extend my 
sincere 
appreciation 
to 
Collierville 
Mayor Stan Joyner, Town Adminis-
trator James Lewellen, and Collierville 
Municipal 
School 
Board 
Chairman 
Wright Cox for their continued and 
strong leadership. 
Mayor Joyner issued a proclamation 
declaring 
tomorrow, 
September 
30, 
2021, at 1:30 p.m., as a day of prayer and 
meditation for the town of Collierville 
and her victims. 
The people of Collierville are strong 
and resilient. They will always remain 
Collierville Strong.

PASS TRANSFORMATIONAL 
CLIMATE LEGISLATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. STRICKLAND) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
Americans nationwide have felt the 
impact of this year’s extreme weather, 
from flooding to wildfires to record 
heat. In Washington State, heat domes 
in June and August of this year have 
caused hundreds to die of heat expo-
sure, roads and highways to buckle, 
and shellfish to broil in their streams. 
The iconic Mount Rainier, one of the 
snowiest places on Earth, was not im-
mune to this. The unprecedented heat, 
nearly 40 degrees above the previous re-
corded high, has had a devastating im-
pact on the mountain. This image 
shows Mount Rainier during most of 
the summer, its sides bare, compared 
to its typical snow cover.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5510 
September 29, 2021 
For longtime residents of Wash-
ington State, it is jarring to see Mount 
Rainier without snow on its peak. In 
just 4 days this summer, 4 days in late 
June, the peak of the heat dome, the 
mountain lost 30 percent of its total 
snow cover. This is a visual demonstra-
tion that climate change is real. 
The lack of snow became more nota-
ble as the summer progressed, and this 
heat is an ecological issue and an eco-
nomic issue. Washington State’s shell-
fish industry is among the largest in 
the Nation, contributing $270 million 
to the State economy and supporting 
nearly 3,000 jobs. 
The heat dome this summer dev-
astated shellfish farms that make up 
the core of this industry. Shellfish 
growers reported shellfish baking to 
death, literally, in shallow water and 
on the beach. Taylor Shellfish, located 
in my district, reported losing over 2 
million clam seeds. 
As our planet warms and climate 
change 
takes 
hold, 
these 
extreme 
weather events are becoming more 
common, costing lives and critically 
damaging our environment and our 
economy. 
Against this backdrop, our need to 
pass transformational climate change 
legislation becomes even more stark 
and more urgent. We must invest in 
electric 
vehicle 
infrastructure. 
We 
must dramatically expand public tran-
sit. We must build an energy grid using 
renewable sources of power. 
We have a once-in-a-generation op-
portunity to create tens of thousands 
of jobs and build a sustainable society 
for future generations. My district, my 
State, and our planet depend on it. 
f 
INDEPENDENCE IN INDIAN 
COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. 
Madam Speaker, October 11 is, in 
South Dakota, Native American Day. 
Now, when America turns its eyes to 
Indian 
reservations, 
so 
often—too 
often—the focus is on poverty, despair, 
dysfunction. But there are wonderful 
stories from Indian Country as well, 
stories 
of 
hope, 
opportunity, 
hard 
work, success, entrepreneurship. 
With that in mind, I want to talk to 
you about Tashina Red Hawk. She is a 
17-year-old member of the Rosebud 
Sioux Tribe. She is an excellent stu-
dent, and she is a rodeo queen. She is 
my friend, and let me tell you, Madam 
Speaker, she is impressive. 
Tashina graduated early from high 
school, and then, when the pandemic 
hit and her college classes went online, 
rather than do what so many teens did, 
spending more time on social media or 
video games, she decided to become an 
entrepreneur. It is just an amazing 
story. 
Her local coffee shop had remained 
closed during the pandemic, so Tashina 
saw an opportunity. She wanted to 
save money for college. 
Again, as I said, she is an excellent 
student. She wants to be a veteri-
narian. Now, she knows that path is 
not going to be easy, and it is going to 
take a few dollars in the bank. She 
knew that this business opportunity 
would give her a wonderful chance. 
Here she is in front of Tashina’s Cof-
fee. She also wanted to make sure that 
her local community, her small town, 
had the same amenities that large 
towns do, and I think we can all agree 
that a powerful cup of coffee is a great 
amenity. From firsthand experience, I 
can tell you that her coffee really is ex-
cellent. 
She works so hard, Madam Speaker, 
long days, long weeks, to make this 
business a success. Tashina is pas-
sionate about instilling a sense of inde-
pendence and hard work among other 
young people on her reservation. 
This woman is going places. I am 
proud to say that she is my friend. 
Her father sums it up well. He said, 
Tashina ‘‘is not a victim. She is an ad-
vocate.’’ 
Now, Tashina’s story is one of many 
throughout Indian Country and the 
State of South Dakota that don’t get 
the attention that they deserve. I 
think of so many Tribal leaders that I 
have met with over the years who 
choose self-reliance: Leslie Crow, our 
office’s inaugural Ben Reifel fellow. 
She is a teacher, a college instructor, a 
small business woman. 
I think of Lakota Vogel. She is the 
executive director of the Four Bands 
Community Fund, and she works with 
Tribal members to build economic op-
portunity on the Cheyenne River In-
dian Reservation. 
I think of Myrna Thompson, sec-
retary of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, 
whose long-term service as secretary of 
that Tribe has been a consistent and 
reliable source of leadership for her 
people. 
Madam Speaker, there are so many 
others. It has been clear to me that Na-
tive American people across this coun-
try are resilient. And those who choose 
hard work and independence over reli-
ance, they are so often successful, and 
they are so often strong. 
They provide us a great opportunity. 
We can be more like them. We can be 
more like Tashina and Lakota and Les-
lie and Myrna. 
This Native American Day, we should 
all take a moment to admire their hard 
work and entrepreneurship, and we 
should follow their example. If there 
were more Tashina Red Hawks, we 
would have a better Nation. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH 
JEAN BECK VUNA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SCHIFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a true public 
servant. We use that term frequently 
and often too casually, but the indi-
vidual I am speaking about unquestion-
ably defines the term and sets an ex-
ample we should all strive to achieve. 
Elizabeth Jean Beck Vuna has served 
as my district office casework manager 
for 20 years. She has served the Con-
gress and the American people for over 
33 years. Prior to serving my constitu-
ents, she worked for Congressman 
Glenn Anderson and Congressman Ste-
phen Horn from Long Beach, Cali-
fornia. 
It is worth noting that the bitter par-
tisan politics of today have never 
touched Elizabeth’s commitment to 
service. She has worked for Democrats 
and Republicans without concern for 
political philosophy. It is that dedica-
tion, that determination to help peo-
ple, and that diligence that truly 
makes her irreplaceable. 
Elizabeth will be retiring on Sep-
tember 30. When she does, we will be 
losing one of the most effective and 
compassionate caseworkers in the his-
tory of the Congress. Yes, I know that 
sounds boastful, but it is quite simply 
the truth. 
Little did I know when I hired Eliza-
beth in 2002 what a profound impact 
she would have on the lives of so many 
of my constituents and on me. 
Elizabeth began her career in public 
service because, when her brother re-
turned home from the Vietnam war, he 
could find no assistance for his PTSD 
and Agent Orange-related illnesses. 
She decided it would be her mission to 
ensure that other veterans would not 
face a similar fate and often focused 
her efforts in helping veterans obtain 
the benefits they so richly deserved. 
She also felt an affinity for immi-
grants since she and her husband 
adopted five orphaned children from 
Tonga. That experience led her to be-
come a local expert in international 
adoption. 
Her compassion for all immigrants 
also led her to become a recognized ex-
pert in the field, and she diligently ad-
vocated for all immigrants to be af-
forded all the benefits legally available 
to them. 
The number of constituents Eliza-
beth has helped in a substantive man-
ner are in the tens of thousands, and I 
am probably undercounting. 
She has mentored other congres-
sional staff and given guidance and di-
rection to everyone who was lucky 
enough to ask her to do so. 
Not a week goes by that I do not hear 
from some of my constituents about 
this miracle or feat that she accom-
plished on their behalf, whether it is 
large or small. 
As her retirement became known, my 
office received dozens of emails thank-
ing her for her service and asking if she 
couldn’t stay just a little longer. 
b 1015 
She has assisted the many studios in 
my district as well as the Jet Propul-
sion Laboratory and the California In-
stitute of Technology, but perhaps

more importantly, she has helped indi-
vidual constituents, who needed a 
fierce champion for their cause, help 
navigate a bureaucracy that can seem 
arcane and senseless at times. 
Elizabeth is a native Californian, the 
daughter of Wilbert and Ellen Beck. 
Her large family is comprised of her 
husband, Steve; sons, Jesse and Sean, 
who 
tragically 
prematurely 
passed 
away; adopted Tongan children, Malia, 
Angela, Michelle, Joshua, and Jacob; 
and over a dozen grandchildren. 
She will be missed in our office and 
by our constituents beyond measure, 
and I cannot thank her enough for her 
service. 
I ask all Members to join me in 
thanking Elizabeth Jean Beck Vuna for 
her unwavering dedication to public 
service and wish her good health and 
prosperity in retirement.

PULLING BACK THE PRO-CHOICE 
CURTAIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the pro- 
abortion lobby cheered last week as 
House Democrats rushed through H.R. 
3755, the abortion on demand until 
birth act. 
Throughout the course of the debate 
last Friday, I listened as my colleagues 
across the aisle took to their bully pul-
pit and sang the praises of the abortion 
industry in America. 
The talking points that afternoon 
were so distorted from reality that it 
was as if members of the abortion 
lobby were the ones that wrote them. 
Some Members claimed that passing 
this bill was a duty that must be ful-
filled to restore the rights of women. 
Others claimed it was a duty that 
upheld the oath they took to defend 
the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, no matter the jus-
tification that was given, the American 
people can see that this is yet another 
elaborate smokescreen coming from 
the majority. 
But what really shook me to my core 
was how abortion was being normalized 
in those moments. Women’s health was 
being used as a euphemism for abor-
tion, as if the health of the baby that 
is destroyed is inconsequential, not to 
mention that half of the babies that 
are aborted are female. You cannot 
claim that this issue is one of ‘‘wom-
en’s health’’ when that is the case. 
The same sentiment applies to the 
phrase ‘‘reproductive freedom’’ that 
was thrown around multiple times. Ex-
plain to me how the process of destroy-
ing an innocent baby resembles free-
dom for the baby. It is outrageous to 
link abortion and the concept of free-
dom together. 
These are the kinds of deliberate spin 
tactics that attempt to hide the hor-
rors of abortion from the American 
people. No set of elaborate talking 
points from pro-abortion advocates can 
truly mask the societal ill that is abor-
tion. 
Unfortunately, that only skims the 
surface of how abortion is being adver-
tised. The left’s narrative on abortions 
has evolved to the point where this im-
moral procedure is now associated with 
pride. Abortion is not prideful. It is not 
a form of empowerment. Abortion is 
robbing a human being of God’s most 
precious gift: life. 
While the left’s narrative grows only 
more devious, the voices of those who 
survived abortions, or whose parents 
chose life, continue to be silenced. The 
stories of these men and women are in-
valuable, and they deserve to be heard 
by everyone. That is the truth of the 
matter. 
Madam Speaker, Republicans fun-
damentally understand that life begins 
at conception and ends at natural 
death. We believe that life is a precious 
and sanctified gift that God has be-
stowed upon us. 
I am proud to stand alongside so 
many constituents of North Carolina’s 
Fifth Congressional District, as well as 
my Republican colleagues in the peo-
ple’s House, in fighting to protect life. 
The unborn deserve nothing less than 
unwavering advocates who stand for 
them. I will always serve as a strong 
voice for the unborn, and I do not plan 
on stopping anytime soon. 
f 
RECKLESS AND SHORTSIGHTED 
RECONCILIATION PACKAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
discuss this reckless and shortsighted 
reconciliation package and what I be-
lieve to be its worst effects on the 
American people. 
The budget reconciliation process ex-
ists to reduce the national deficit with 
a majority vote, not to let the major-
ity party jam partisan legislation 
through this Congress. Since January, 
Speaker PELOSI and House Democrats 
have not used reconciliation for its in-
tended purpose but rather to pass the 
$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan on 
party lines and now the $3.5 trillion 
budget blueprint. Here, we see the op-
posite of the intended use for the rec-
onciliation process and the opposite of 
the word ‘‘reconciliation’’ itself. This 
is division. 
Senator BERNIE SANDERS, chairman 
of the Senate Budget Committee, said 
that under this budget, no middle-in-
come family would pay more in taxes. 
That is not true. The reconciliation 
bill includes damaging tax increases, 
falling largely on the shoulders of mid-
dle-income families, small business 
owners, and family farms. This bill 
would be the largest tax-and-spend 
measure in America’s history and 
would increase the national debt to $45 
trillion by 2031. In addition to the dev-
astating spending and tax hikes, it 
would allow the Federal Government 
to intervene even more in our daily 
lives and kill countless jobs. 
Unfortunately, the Senate version of 
this package could be even worse. 
Right now, the House version of the 
bill keeps stepped up basis intact, 
which protects family farms from 
being taxed out of existence, and it 
does not include the requirement that 
banks report to the IRS all trans-
actions over $600, which is patently lu-
dicrous. I am prepared to offer an 
amendment on the final bill if either of 
these two provisions, amongst others, 
are changed. 
This is the largest tax-and-spend bill 
in the history of the country. Only 1 
percent has even been scored by the 
Congressional Budget Office. It would 
result in a whopping $10,600 per Amer-
ican in new spending. We are spending 
money we don’t have on things that we 
don’t need, and I urge this Congress to 
join me in opposing this horrible legis-
lation which will weaken our great Na-
tion and reduce our freedom. 
A PATH TO HEALING AND RECONCILIATION 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss what I see as the path 
to healing and reconciliation in our 
country. 
We have a promise from God about 
how to heal our Nation. It is very sim-
ple, and it is from II Chronicles. The 
Lord says: ‘‘If my people who are called 
by my name shall humble themselves 
and pray and seek my face and turn 
from their wicked ways, then will I 
hear from heaven, and will forgive 
their sin, and will heal their land.’’ 
It is almost as though God crafted 
this message for our present moment. I 
am proud to be part of the crew of peo-
ple on this Earth who strive to live by 
God’s 
promises: 
those 
who 
follow 
Jesus. You can find us throughout Kan-
sas and from Austin, Texas, to Ham-
ilton, Montana, to Simmons, Ken-
tucky, to Thompson, Connecticut. 
In this country, so many people ad-
vance against one another in jealousy 
and pride, they rush to judgment and 
they rob each other of the dignity and 
respect we owe our fellow citizens when 
we should be carrying each other’s bur-
dens. If we don’t stop this behavior, we 
will incur the punishment it deserves: 
enmity, discord, and separation. 
I think of my daughter when I tuck 
her in at night and my son when we go 
fishing. I don’t want them to live in a 
country that is playing the dangerous 
game of division and hatred for the 
next 99 years, but a world of hope, 
peace, and love. If our country keeps 
rejecting God, we will only make it 
harder for ourselves to accomplish this. 
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF DR. BARRY 
FLINCHBAUGH 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life of a 
truly 
great 
Kansan, 
Dr. 
Barry 
Flinchbaugh, who died last year at the 
age of 78. 
Dr. Flinchbaugh taught my ag policy 
class 
at 
Kansas 
State 
University, 
which is the best class I took at col-
lege. He had a larger-than-life de-
meanor; was committed to production 
agriculture; was involved, at some

level, in every farm bill going back 
over 50 years; and was sharp, witty, and 
hilarious. Dr. Flinchbaugh did more for 
Kansas farmers than possibly anyone 
else during his lifetime. 
His expertise in ag policy led him to 
meet every President from Harry Tru-
man to George W. Bush. But he wasn’t 
interested in notoriety. He was pas-
sionate about his family, his field of 
study, and his students, who were his 
legacy and his pride and joy. I was one 
of the 5,000 students Dr. Flinchbaugh 
taught over the span of 49 years, and I 
can picture him now, cigar in hand, 
holding court in his classroom or in his 
office, surrounded by transfixed young 
people, many of whom would later go 
on to become leaders in the very field 
they learned from him. 
I would like to close with one of his 
quotes that I think we all need to hear, 
especially in this deliberative body at 
the present time. He said: ‘‘There are 
two ways to make public decisions: 
compromise or dictatorship. There’s 
nothing in between.’’ 
f 
RECOGNIZING JULIAN STANFORD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
resiliency and the courage of Julian 
Stanford. Julian is a 17-year-old high 
school student who was recently in-
volved in a life-changing accident. 
While driving home after work on 
August 21, Julian attempted to avoid 
an oncoming vehicle, resulting in para-
lyzing injuries. Julian was transferred 
to the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, 
Georgia, where his treatment has been 
centered around healing and prayer. 
Prior to his accident, Julian was an 
honor roll student and an active leader 
in his high school’s Republican Party. 
Known throughout his community for 
his laughter and his love of music, 
Julian’s passion for life is truly inspir-
ing. 
Despite the extent of his injuries, Ju-
lian continues to fight daily with his 
mom by his side. Julian is a living mir-
acle whose determination is remark-
able. 
I am praying for Julian and his fam-
ily, that he makes a full recovery, and 
I know he will go on to achieve great 
things. 
Julian, we love you and you inspire 
us. Keep up the good fight. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION 
MONTH 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sep-
tember as National Suicide Prevention 
Month. This important month is an op-
portunity to remember those who have 
lost their lives to suicide and share re-
sources 
to 
fight 
the 
stigma 
sur-
rounding mental health challenges. 
As the tenth leading cause of death 
in the United States, suicide affects 
Americans from all walks of life. The 
challenges surrounding mental health 
can be complex, but we owe it to our 
constituents to utilize every resource 
to better understand the factors con-
tributing to suicide. 
A critical part in suicide prevention 
is equipping ourselves and our commu-
nities with the resources needed to 
fight this tragic occurrence. From en-
gaging in open conversations about 
mental health to checking on our 
neighbor, there are steps we can all 
take to help those in crisis. 
September may be Suicide Preven-
tion Month, but community engage-
ment and prevention efforts should be 
maintained year-round. 
I encourage everyone to educate 
themselves on the warning signs of sui-
cide, as it could save a life. 
REMEMBERING DON AND MARGIE VARNADOE 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Don and 
Margie Varnadoe of Glynn County, 
Georgia, who tragically passed away on 
September 25. Don and Margie were 
aboard Amtrak’s Empire Builder train 
when it derailed near Joplin, Montana. 
Don and Margie were known through-
out the community for their service to 
the 
Glynn 
County 
school 
system. 
Margie was a teacher, a principal, a 
personnel director, and assistant super-
intendent. She was loved by her stu-
dents and peers for her dedication to 
educating our future generations. 
Don was a retired St. Simons real es-
tate agent and school board member 
for four years. During his term, Don fo-
cused on improving the school system 
so that all students in Glynn County 
could have a positive learning experi-
ence. 
Both cared immensely for their com-
munity, and I am thankful for Don and 
Margie’s impact on Georgia’s First 
Congressional District. Their irreplace-
able presence will be missed by all.

SERIOUS PROBLEMS ARE GETTING 
WORSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
Joe Biden preached vague, feel-good 
messages to voters, like healing our 
country and pursuing bipartisanship, 
during his campaign for President. In 
his victory speech, he ripped off a line 
from Barack Obama and said: ‘‘I pledge 
to be a President who seeks not to di-
vide but to unify, who doesn’t see red 
and blue States but a United States.’’ 
Madam Speaker, these messages were 
blatant lies. His record 8 months into 
his tenure proves his only intention is 
to govern on behalf of the Democrat 
Party’s far-left base. 
Look at the ongoing farce on our 
southern border. The Department of 
Homeland Security just released thou-
sands of unvetted Haitian migrants 
into this country, no questions asked. 
Even worse, the President turned his 
back on Border Patrol agents over that 
bogus horse photo. 
Our government wouldn’t behave this 
way unless it was worried about back-
lash from leftists who want to open our 
borders and defund the Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement agency. 
The border has been out of control 
from the moment Joe Biden stepped 
foot in the Oval Office. Month after 
month after month, we hear about Bor-
der Patrol agents encountering hun-
dreds of thousands of migrants at-
tempting to illegally enter our coun-
try. President Biden put Vice President 
HARRIS in charge of fixing our southern 
border, but whatever she is doing to 
‘‘address the root cause of migration’’ 
obviously isn’t working. 
Last week, the White House press 
secretary whined about Republicans 
giving floor speeches about the crisis 
at the border. I say to the press sec-
retary: We wouldn’t need to be down 
here raising Hades if your boss would 
quit being so soft, start doing his job, 
and enforce the dadgum border laws. 
b 1030 
Chaos at the southern border is just 
one of the many crises of Joe Biden’s 
own creation. I could stand down here 
for 
hours 
talking 
about 
inflation 
caused by reckless government spend-
ing, a failed exit from Afghanistan that 
left 13 American servicemembers dead, 
including one of my constituents—his 
family lives in my neighborhood—and 
much more. 
But my point is this, Madam Speak-
er, Americans across the political spec-
trum see Joe Biden standing idly by 
while this country is being destroyed. 
They think this President is grossly in-
competent and incapable of responsibly 
running the executive branch. I have 
even talked to Democrats here in Con-
gress who are extremely concerned 
about these very issues. 
Serious problems are getting worse, 
yet Joe Biden doesn’t show any inter-
est in solving them. Given this Presi-
dent’s lack of interest in serving as 
Chief Executive, I can confidently say 
this President is mentally unwell and 
unfit for office. 
It is time for Joe Biden to step down. 
We need a leader who cares about the 
future of this country, not one who 
isn’t even aware of the damage he is 
causing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

WE MUST SECURE OUR BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to discuss the ongoing bor-
der crisis. 
Last week, President Biden’s Home-
land Security Secretary, Alejandro 
Mayorkas, told Congress, ‘‘The border 
is secure.’’ The facts indicate that this 
statement was absolutely false. 
The Biden administration has em-
braced policies to open the southern

September 29, 2021 
border, not to secure it. In reality, 
these open border policies have created 
one of the worst border crises in his-
tory. 
According to U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection, this August alone, 
208,887 people were apprehended trying 
to illegally enter our country through 
the southern border, which is a 317 per-
cent increase from last August. It is 
really a big problem, Madam Speaker. 
Since February of 2021, the agency 
says more than 1.2 million people have 
been apprehended illegally crossing the 
border. That staggering statistic rep-
resents more than the entire Pasco or 
Pinellas Counties, which are in my 
congressional 
district. 
I 
represent 
them. 
When I was at the border a few 
months ago, Madam Speaker, the CBP 
agents I spoke with made it clear that 
they weren’t even making a dent when 
it came to capturing the historic num-
ber of people who are illegally entering 
our country or with seizing the ex-
traordinary volume of drugs that are 
flowing across the border. 
That is truly unfathomable when you 
consider that CBP has seized 724 
pounds of fentanyl and 595 pounds of 
heroin so far in fiscal year 2021. 
These deadly drugs don’t just stay in 
communities along the border. They 
are spread throughout the country into 
communities like mine in the Tampa 
Bay area. These drugs are ruining and 
claiming 
countless 
lives, 
Madam 
Speaker. In fact, Florida currently 
ranks second in the Nation for over-
dose deaths. 
These are our neighbors and members 
of our family who are dying. We have 
to take action now. 
In addition to drugs, weapons and hu-
mans are being trafficked through the 
border. Human traffickers are making 
an estimated $15 million a day. I am 
concerned for these victims, many of 
whom are children. 
The root causes of this crisis are 
clear. President Biden’s disastrous im-
migration policies are to blame. His 
administration stopped building the 
wall, brought back catch-and-release, 
and tried to get rid of the remain in 
Mexico policy. 
The President himself has actually 
articulated a new openness toward mi-
grants; something the leaders of Cen-
tral America point to as a root cause of 
the crisis they are seeing. 
The situation at the border is a dan-
gerous, unmitigated disaster, Madam 
Speaker. 
Especially now, as our enemies feel 
emboldened by what recently tran-
spired in Afghanistan, we have to se-
cure our border as a matter of national 
security. 
f 
HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the work Congress 
is undertaking to make historic invest-
ments in our Nation’s infrastructure 
and create millions of good-paying jobs 
in communities across our country, 
coast to coast, communities just like 
mine. 
Cities like Toledo, Sandusky, Lorain, 
Lakewood, Cleveland, Parma, for too 
long have received far fewer resources 
than are needed to keep pace with life 
in this 21st century. 
As we look around our country right 
now, we bear witness to historic water 
shortages in Lake Mead. On the other 
hand, in my region of the country, we 
have historic high water levels in the 
Great Lakes. Meanwhile, we have rag-
ing wildfires in California. We have 
watched power blackouts in Texas; tor-
rential rains and flooding in New York 
City, in Dearborn, Michigan, and rural 
farmlands outside Nashville; as well as 
hurricanes that have been ravaging 
States throughout the Gulf of Mexico. 
Truly, in this new century, we must 
set a firmer course to sustain life in 
our country and, yes, sustain life on 
Mother Earth herself. 
As a Representative from the Great 
Lakes, I can say without a shadow of a 
doubt that Lake Erie and the econo-
mies and people who truly rely on it 
face growing environmental challenges 
unlike any we have seen before. 
The Great Lakes are the largest 
source of freshwater on Earth, and 
surely on this continent. They are re-
sponsible for transporting our Nation’s 
heavy manufacturing materials from 
ports to factories, support our commer-
cial and defense capabilities, and serve 
as the lifeblood for our industrial 
heartland. 
But the changing climate is impact-
ing these majestic waters, requiring 
sizable investments to correct and 
overcome. 
Recently, the House Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee included 
$350 million for a new state-of-the-art— 
get ready—Great Lakes heavy ice-
breaker for our region. Some Members 
of Congress said, ‘‘Oh, you have ice?’’ 
Let me tell you, in the winter, yes, we 
do. This investment will ensure that 
for decades to come the thousands of 
miles of shipping lanes of the Great 
Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway, 
our Nation’s longest coastline, are nav-
igable, and that the materials that 
make our country run are able to be 
delivered 
and 
that 
our 
freshwater 
bounty is preserved for the future. 
I want to especially thank Chairman 
PETER DEFAZIO of the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee for tak-
ing up this request from our bipartisan 
House Great Lakes Task Force. 
As co-chair of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Energy and Water, 
our members delivered the funding bill 
necessary to turbocharge investments 
in coastal resiliency across our coun-
try; in home weatherization programs, 
as climate changes from coast to coast; 
to modernize the Soo Locks, essential 
for industry as well as the defense of 
this Nation; and to focus on next-gen-
eration energy, solar energy tech-
nology, and technologies we are invent-
ing. In hydrogen, in various types of 
thermal water technologies there is so 
much where America will lead the 
world in inventions for the future. 
To succeed, we have to make sure 
these investments make it through 
this Congress and that infrastructure 
investment makes it to President 
Biden’s desk. Old infrastructure is 
crumbling, as our climate is changing, 
and we are running out of time. 
We know that a functioning Soo 
Locks system between Lake Superior 
and the rest of the Great Lakes, for ex-
ample, supports more than 11 million 
jobs. That is a ‘‘wow’’ by any measure. 
And we know that clean energy tech-
nologies, like solar and wind, are vital 
to powering our Nation and producing 
clean and affordable energy, and build-
ing our future right here, right now at 
home. 
In northern Ohio, we have brilliant 
workers at innovative companies like 
Toledo Solar and First Solar that are 
developing the revolutionary solar pan-
els that will power homes, businesses, 
and factories in every corner of our Na-
tion. 
We are literally building the change 
forward right now, providing for our 
domestic energy security and inde-
pendence. 
But companies like these need work-
ers, and workers need training, and 
that is what the infrastructure and 
jobs bill will allow us to do, build back 
better for America’s tomorrow, as 
President Biden knows we must. 
We are talking about good-paying, 
middle-class jobs. We are talking about 
investing in climate resilience and en-
vironmental conservation that restores 
communities, puts people to work, and 
ensures our families have wages that 
meet their needs and allow them to 
buy the vitals they need for life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
SHERWOOD BOEHLERT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
my former Congressman, Sherwood 
Boehlert, affectionately known by ev-
eryone as Sherry. 
Sherry was a devout public servant 
who passed away last week at the age 
of 84. After serving in the United 
States Army, his love for his commu-
nity and State led him to begin his ca-
reer in public service. He was elected as 
the Oneida County Executive in 1979. 
He was then elected to represent our 
community in the House of Represent-
atives in 1983 and served for 24 years, 
until 2006. 
Throughout his time in Congress, 
Sherry was committed to representing 
our region to the best of his ability. He 
returned home whenever he could. In 
2001, he was elected chair of the House 
Committee on Science, a coveted posi-
tion that built on his love of nature

and our environment. He actually led 
the charge to tackle the issue of acid 
rain and had tremendous success. 
He is remembered by his colleagues 
as a remarkable individual and never 
lost sight of the reason he was elected: 
to fight for all of us in upstate New 
York. 
Sherry was born in 1936. He spent his 
childhood in my hometown of New 
Hartford, New York. Prior to elected 
office, Sherry Boehlert graduated from 
Utica College, a local favorite. He went 
on to serve as chief of staff to former 
Congressman 
Alexander 
Pirnie 
and 
then also served under former Con-
gressman Donald Mitchell before he ac-
tually served as county executive and 
later as Congressman. He married his 
lovely wife, Marianne, and was im-
mensely proud as a father to his four 
children. 
I just wanted to share a few reflec-
tions on Sherry. I obviously had the 
honor of working with him while I was 
a staffer for the Assembly. I do live in 
our former Congressman’s home, Alex-
ander Pirnie, and while Sherry was his 
chief of staff, he often commented to 
me about what I have done with the 
house. Where I was, what I have done 
with it, how much time he spent there 
and how he knew every corner of it, 
working with our former Congressman. 
I also have a funny story about our 
family business. Our newspaper, the 
Mid-York 
Weekly, 
and 
also 
the 
Pennysaver were located in the dis-
trict, and I had the occasion to invite 
Congressman Boehlert to visit us and 
to see our operations. It was quite a 
fun day. 
We got to the back—in the newspaper 
business, as many know, we have an in-
serting operation where we put our fly-
ers in the back of the newspaper, and it 
tended to be filled with a lot of retired 
farmers and a lot of people from our 
community, particularly a lot of very 
energetic senior citizens—and Sherry 
got back there and was really excited 
to meet them all. 
One of them put him to the challenge 
to see if he could actually do the job. 
And so Sherry, without hesitation, 
took off his business coat, rolled up his 
sleeves, sat down and started inserting 
newspapers in our business. They loved 
him for that. It was really a fun mo-
ment, and I think he had a really great 
time with our seniors and with a lot of 
our staff. 
We are always grateful for him for 
coming to our newspaper. And also for 
his annual support of a publication, a 
special publication we put out each 
February honoring our Presidents, our 
Vice-Presidents, our First Ladies, and 
of course our First Dogs, and Sherry 
was always so supportive of us for that. 
We are just so glad that we are able 
to honor him this week with so many 
great reflections and so many people 
reaching out to me in Congress. Over 
the last week, it was really heart-
warming to get those messages from 
Members of Congress, and I might add 
on both sides of the aisle. I have seen 
many tributes, even on the Senate side. 
He will always be fondly remembered 
by all of our colleagues, Republicans 
and Democrats. 
Earlier this week, I had the distinct 
honor of participating in his funeral 
service alongside previous elected offi-
cials from our region, also other Con-
gress Members. It was a solemn occa-
sion honoring his life, but also a joyous 
one to celebrate all that he achieved 
for our community. 
Today, my thoughts and my prayers 
are with Sherry’s family, especially his 
wife, Marianne, who is also a devoted 
public servant. 
I ask that you please join me now in 
remembering Sherry with a moment of 
silence in this great Chamber where he 
served so many years. Thank you, all.

TIME IS NOW TO INVEST IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, the 
time is now to make historic invest-
ments in families, workers, and com-
munities across the country. 
Everyone, no matter who they are or 
where they live, deserves access to 
modern, dependable infrastructure to 
maintain the quality of life for Ameri-
cans in the 21st century. That is why 
we must pass the President’s bipar-
tisan infrastructure package tomor-
row. 
We are living off the investments our 
grandparents and parents made genera-
tions ago. In many communities, that 
is no longer sustainable. 
In my home State of California, we 
are suffering from the devastating ef-
fects of climate change, historical 
fires, and droughts. 
Farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, 
which I represent, also need an infra-
structure that reflects their ability to 
put food on America’s dinner table 
every night. The devastating dry condi-
tions and the lack of water have led 
many of them to fallow their fields, 
hundreds and thousands of acres of pro-
ductive farmland. 
It is as simple as this: Without food 
from our farmers, Americans don’t eat. 
It is a national security issue. There-
fore, we must fix our broken water in-
frastructure system. 
The only way to ensure farmers have 
the water they need to feed our Nation 
is to build and improve more convey-
ance and storage facilities. 
This infrastructure package will help 
that, as well as efforts that we are pur-
suing under the reconciliation pack-
age. We need to capture and improve 
and store water for times such as now. 
In addition to that, we need to make 
other critical investments in rural and 
underserved 
areas 
by 
expanding 
broadband. Broadband access today is 
just like rural electrification was in 
the 1930s. No American should be with-
out broadband. 
We also learned from the COVID–19 
crisis that access to quality healthcare 
is critical. It is critical that we have 
ample physicians and nurses. We can 
make more protective equipment, but 
we can’t make more doctors and 
nurses. Therefore, we have a serious 
shortage of healthcare professionals, 
and that is why a part of this effort to 
build back America better is to provide 
medical schools and underserved areas 
improved access to our broadband. 
That is critical. We must do that. 
In addition, investing in public trans-
portation for our economy is just as es-
sential. The United States is trailing 
other nations when it comes to invest-
ments in modern infrastructure and 
transportation like high-speed rail. It 
is time that we bring our system into 
the 21st century. 
Finishing California’s high-speed rail 
efforts, along with four other corridors 
in the country, will help our climate, 
improve traffic gridlock, and reduce 
emissions that pollute the air. 
Climate change is an important part 
of this essential package of investing 
in our infrastructure. We know, with 
the results of droughts, fires, floods, 
and hurricanes, that the climate is 
changing, and we need to provide tools 
to address that. 
Without critical investments in this 
infrastructure package that we will 
vote on tomorrow, our Nation will suf-
fer. Making life better for our constitu-
ents is my top priority and should be 
the priority of Congresspeople through-
out the country. It requires us to focus 
on the health and development of our 
communities, and the economy needs 
us to support this effort. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to 
how much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 11⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, as we 
talk about building back better, let me 
also note that we must pass a con-
tinuing resolution to ensure that gov-
ernment stays operating. 
Shutting down the government is not 
an option, and we should act upon this 
in the next 24 hours to whatever ex-
tended date is agreed as well as lifting 
the debt ceiling. 
In the 17 years I have been here, I 
have never, under Republican and 
Democratic 
administrations 
alike, 
voted to shut down government. That 
is irresponsible, and therefore, we must 
also lift the debt ceiling. This is, in 
fact, to pay bills that Congress in the 
previous administration has already 
created, and we don’t want to be dead-
beats. 
The impacts on our economy would 
be devastating in terms of even con-
templating shutting down government 
or not lifting the debt ceiling. 
HONORING SHERWOOD BOEHLERT 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I was 
saddened to learn of our colleague Con-
gressman Sherry Boehlert’s passing. I 
served with him during his last term, 
as he was chair of the Science, Space, 
and Technology Committee.

Sherry was terrific. Sherry’s focus on 
making sure that Americans address 
the needs of science in a changing 
world was always at the forefront as 
chairman of the committee. I went 
with Sherry on an incredible trip to 
Antarctica to explore the impacts of

Beyond his contributions to the Con-

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
RECOVERY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize September as National Recovery 
Month. 
It is important that we draw atten-
tion to this special month as we con-
tinue to battle the ongoing addiction 
epidemic in our country. 
For 32 years, National Recovery 
Month has continued to celebrate the 
gains made by those in recovery as well 
as promote and support new evidence- 
based treatment and recovery prac-
tices. It is also a time to focus on rais-
ing awareness and understanding of 
mental health and substance use dis-
orders. 
Over the past month, many of my 
colleagues have sported purple ribbons 
to show our support for those in recov-
ery. 
Currently, over 23 million Americans 
are in recovery from an addiction to 
drugs or alcohol. By recognizing Na-
tional Recovery Month, we can high-
light the strength of the recovery com-
munity 
and 
show 
support 
to 
our 
healthcare workers, first responders, 
friends, family, and community who 
support those in recovery. 
Addiction to alcohol or other sub-
stances like opioids is an ongoing epi-
demic plaguing communities across the 
Nation. We know addiction does not 
discriminate. It can happen to anyone, 
regardless of race, gender, or socio-
economic status. 
That is why this year’s National Re-
covery Month theme is ‘‘Recovery for 
Everyone: Every Person, Every Fam-
ily, Every Community.’’ 
As we continue to battle the addic-
tion epidemic, we must highlight the 
work of organizations like Faces and 
Voices of Recovery that promote Na-
tional Recovery Month and continue to 
provide resources to those in recovery 
as well as friends and family. 
In my home State of Pennsylvania, 
there were more than 5,200 deaths due 
to drug overdoses this past year. These 
numbers continue to be highly alarm-
ing, and we must continue to work to 
combat this epidemic. 
No one can tackle addiction on their 
own, and by recognizing National Re-
covery Month, we are showing there is 
light at the end of the tunnel, and with 
the right support, there is a road to re-
covery. 
Throughout the month of September, 
Faces and Voices of Recovery encour-
ages local communities to host events 
to highlight the services available for 
those in need. 
Last week, Venango County Human 
Services celebrated National Recovery 
Month at Franklin’s Bandstand Park. 
This event had family-friendly activi-
ties, where those who participated 
could win prizes, enjoy refreshments, 
and pin a ribbon on the recovery board. 
The event celebrated community mem-
bers, first responders, healthcare work-
ers, and others who support recovery. 
Local vendors were encouraged to set 
up tables to share information about 
their programs. The evening ended in a 
candlelight vigil, remembering those 
who had passed due to their addiction. 
By engaging our local communities, 
we can continue to make recovery and 
those who support it possible. We can 
work together to change the way ad-
diction and recovery are understood, to 
better support those who are strug-
gling. 
As September ends, let’s continue to 
elevate the organizations that provide 
resources and support to those recov-
ering from addiction.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O God, our king eternal, You divide 
the day from the night, turn the shad-
ow of darkness into morning light. You 
separate the dry land from the waters, 
the Earth from the heavens. 
Remind us again that You have cre-
ated all things, breathed life into each 
creature that walks on the Earth, flies 
in the sky, or swims in the sea. You are 
the source of our every blessing. 
Call to our awareness that You reign 
over dominions and nations, principal-
ities and palaces. Sit upon the throne 
of our hearts and reign in us. 
With You as our guide, we have but 
to yield to Your direction. 
With You as our master, we have but 
to serve Your will. 
With You as our ruler, we have but to 
submit to Your design. 
And so we pray that we would hum-
ble ourselves before You this day, that 
You would lead us in the way we should

The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-

Mrs. MURPHY of Florida led the

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

INVESTING IN AMERICA’S 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act. 
The Senate passed the bill with all 50 
Democrats and 19 Republicans voting 
yes. Now, it is time for the House to 
follow suit. Then we can send the bill 
to President Biden, who played a crit-
ical role in crafting this legislation. 
In Congress, we have been talking 
about investing in America’s infra-
structure for decades, to the point that 
it has become a punch line. Now, we 
are finally on the cusp of taking action 
to match the rhetoric. 
Passage of this bill will prove the two 
parties can still work together in par-
tisan times. It will show the American 
people their elected leaders can govern 
in a competent and constructive way, 
despite their differences. 
The bill will provide my home State 
of 
Florida 
with 
better 
roads 
and 
bridges, improved rail and bus options, 
modernized air and seaports, high- 
speed broadband, and clean drinking 
water. It will improve quality of life

and create good-paying jobs, helping to 
diversify our economy and sustain our 
growing population. 
The bill will also make historic in-
vestments to combat climate change, 
an existential threat to our planet, our 
country, and the Florida way of life. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
abandon their cynical quest for polit-
ical advantage and to vote for this 
good bill. I ask my Democratic col-
leagues to discard their ill-fated effort 
to gain leverage over members of their 
own party and to vote for this good 
bill.

RECOGNIZING STATE COLLEGE 
AREA MEALS ON WHEELS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the State College Area Meals on 
Wheels as they celebrate 50 years of 
service and 1.5 million meals delivered. 
State College Meals on Wheels pre-
pares and delivers meals to the elderly 
and those people living with disabil-
ities within the State College school 
district. 
What originally started as a small vi-
sion serving under 30 clients has now 
blossomed into eight separate delivery 
routes, averaging 250 clients a year. 
When our world came to a halt dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic, Meals on 
Wheels stepped up. The organization 
didn’t miss a single delivery during the 
pandemic. They even picked up a few 
more clients who were adversely af-
fected. 
Like many, Meals on Wheels had to 
adapt to the pandemic. A key aspect of 
the meal delivery was the frequent in- 
person conversations with the clients. 
When COVID–19 prevented the face-to- 
face chatting, they changed their serv-
ices to provide regular phone calls to 
catch up with their clients. 
Madam Speaker, State College Meals 
on Wheels is a staple in our commu-
nity, and I congratulate them on 50 
years and 1.5 million meals delivered. 
f 
CORRECTING THE RECORD ON 
STUART SCHELLER 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to correct the record. 
Yesterday, while proselytizing about 
the ongoing case of Stuart Scheller, 
one of my colleagues demonstrated a 
concerning misunderstanding of armed 
service to one’s country. 
Stuart Scheller did not ‘‘stand up to 
incompetence.’’ He broke his oath, one 
that all Marines take that explicitly 
outlines our duty to obey the Presi-
dent’s legal orders; the same oath I 
took when I was sworn into the Marine 
Corps 11 years ago. Yesterday, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs spoke di-
rectly to this understanding: the prin-
ciple of civilian control of the military 
is critical to this republic. 
A marine who posts videos of himself 
saying ‘‘follow me and we will bring 
the whole system down’’ is not a mar-
tyr. Stuart Scheller is a liability to our 
national security, and he will be pro-
vided the same due process that our 
fellow Marines have fought for and died 
to protect. 
f 
PLUNGING OUR NATION FURTHER 
INTO CRIPPLING DEBT 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, for the last 9 months, 
Washington 
Democrats 
have 
been 
steamrolling Congress and the Amer-
ican people with a series of socialist, 
Big Government takeovers. With such 
fragile control of the White House, 
Senate, and House, Democrats have au-
thorized trillions in unchecked spend-
ing, plunging our Nation into further 
crippling debt. 
The American people are suffering 
the economic consequences of Biden’s 
unhinged spending in the form of stag-
gering inflation and decreased pur-
chasing power, which I fear could lead 
us to double-digit inflation by the end 
of this year. 
I refuse to stand by as House Demo-
crats attempt to bankrupt our children 
and grandchildren. To correct this be-
havior and increase financial trans-
parency, I have introduced the IN-
FORM Act, the companion bill to Sen-
ator MIKE BRAUN from Indiana. 
The INFORM Act brings much-need-
ed 
accountability 
to 
government 
spending by requiring two new govern-
ment-wide reporting standards on the 
national debt and deficits and studies 
net fiscal burdens on different popu-
lations. 
With the debt growing bigger every 
day and Democrats showing no sign of 
restraint in their plans to try to bank-
rupt America, my bill is an essential 
part of ensuring that we create a re-
sponsible financial future for genera-
tions to come. 
f 
TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS HAS 
FAILED 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, over 
the past 50 years, income inequality 
has exploded in our country. 
For decades, trickle-down economics 
has guided our country’s fiscal policy, 
selling the American people a bill of 
goods about how cutting taxes for big 
business and the wealthy would even-
tually benefit society at large. 
Most Americans have experienced 
this policy failure firsthand. They have 
watched the rich and powerful accumu-
late wealth while the middle class 
shrinks and families struggle to stay 
afloat. Study after study has shown 
that instead of promoting jobs or 
growth, tax cuts for the rich have in-
creased inequality. 
It is time to reject the failed theory 
of trickle-down economics and finally 
give everyday Americans a fair shot. 
The Build Back Better Act will pro-
vide one of the biggest middle-class tax 
cuts in history and invest in the Amer-
ican people to build a stronger, more 
inclusive economy. 
The best part? It is paid for by mak-
ing those at the top finally pay their 
fair share. 
The system has been rigged against 
most Americans for far too long. We 
have a chance to fix it now. Let’s get it 
done. 
f 
WE NEED TO STOP THE SOCIALIST 
SPENDING SPREE 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, this 
is a consequential week for the country 
that we love and its future. 
House Democrats are preparing to 
ram through the most expensive spend-
ing package this institution has ever 
seen, with a combined price tag of $5.5 
trillion. 
$5.5 trillion, let that astronomical 
figure sink in. 
This package contains a $2.1 trillion 
tax increase on hardworking families 
and job creators, the largest in history. 
It bypasses needed infrastructure prior-
ities in favor of Green New Deal pet 
projects, and it adds mountains of debt 
burden to our kids’ and grandkids’ fu-
ture. 
Meanwhile, all of this reckless spend-
ing comes at a time when inflation is 
already sky-high, and it will only make 
the cost of daily necessities continue 
to go up and up. 
There is simply no justification for a 
package so expansive, so excessive, and 
so extreme. 
For the sake of America’s future, we 
need to stop this socialist spending 
spree in its tracks. 
f 
ELECTRIFYING FEDERAL VEHICLE 
FLEETS 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support 
of the robust funding to electrify Fed-
eral vehicle fleets included in the Build 
Back Better Act. 
Our climate is rapidly changing, and 
humans are the primary cause. 
In 2019, the transportation sector ac-
counted for 70 percent of petroleum 
used in the United States and was the 
largest contributor to greenhouse gas 
emissions nationwide. 
Transitioning to electric vehicles 
will reduce our carbon output and im-
prove the environment for our children 
and our grandchildren.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5517 
September 29, 2021 
That is why the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform approved nearly $12 
billion to transition the postal fleet 
and GSA fleets to electric vehicles and 
to charge them at post offices across 
the country. 
This funding will help purchase more 
than 300,000 electric vehicles and the 
devices needed to charge them, making 
the United States a leader on climate 
change 
and 
building 
an 
environ-
mentally friendly fleet of the future. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Build Back Better Act and its robust 
funding for electric vehicles.

ADDRESSING THE CALIFORNIA 
DROUGHT CRISIS 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to again request an urgent 
response to the California drought cri-
sis. 
Members of Congress have been back 
in Washington for legislative business 
for over one week, and still, my col-
leagues in the majority refuse to take 
up this issue. 
My legislation, the NEED Water Act 
and the RENEW WIIN ACT, are critical 
steps to addressing California’s ongo-
ing drought and the water shortages 
farmers and communities continually 
face in the State. 
Water is the top issue for many fami-
lies in my district. Securing this vital 
resource for our farmers and ensuring 
communities have a clean, reliable 
source of water has always been a pri-
ority of mine in Congress. 
It is disappointing that the House 
majority does not share my priority of 
taking care of families in rural Cali-
fornia and supporting farmers that feed 
our entire Nation. 
I implore my colleagues to step 
across the aisle to work with me to ad-
dress the suffering of families and 
farmers in California. Communities in 
my district and across the State ur-
gently need our help.

HONORING 
THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF ANITA DORR TO EMERGENCY 
NURSING 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to mark National 
Emergency Nurses Week and to honor 
the contributions of Anita Dorr. 
Anita was an emergency room nurse 
at the Erie County Medical Center in 
Buffalo, New York. She observed that 
emergency rooms could do better in 
the many types of crises coming 
through emergency room doors. 
She developed the crash cart, which 
has drawers that contain defibrillators, 
life-supporting drugs, and other essen-
tial items for crisis care. The crash 
cart is now universally used in medical 
settings around the world and has 
saved countless lives. 
Anita also cofounded the Emergency 
Nurses Association to advocate for 
nurses 
and 
support 
their 
training 
across America. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring emergency nurses as well as 
Anita Dorr’s lasting contributions to 
the medical field and to my commu-
nity. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, last 
week during a Committee on Homeland 
Security hearing, Secretary Mayorkas 
testified, and he stated on numerous 
occasions that our border is secure. 
Even 
as 
encounters 
of 
migrants 
reached historic levels and the amount 
of narcotics being smuggled across our 
border soar, Secretary Mayorkas and 
the Biden administration refuse to 
admit there is a problem. 
The border crisis is fueled by the 
President’s actions, such as his deci-
sion to stop building the wall; his deci-
sion to cancel successful Trump immi-
gration policies; and his decision to 
signal that amnesty will be provided to 
those who come here illegally. 
Former Secretary of State Colin 
Powell had a policy known as the Pot-
tery Barn rule, which was, in short, 
‘‘You break it, you own it.’’ 
The Biden administration has cre-
ated this crisis, and now it is time for 
the President to own the consequences 
of his actions. 
f 
HONORING OUR BRAVE 
SERVICEMEMBERS 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember our 
13 fallen servicemembers who made the 
ultimate sacrifice to save the lives of 
Americans and our allies in Afghani-
stan. 
These brave men and women—includ-
ing southern California marines Lance 
Corporal Dylan Merola, Lance Corporal 
Kareem Nikoui, and Corporal Hunter 
Lopez—were young, many in their 20s 
and incredibly brave, valiantly putting 
their lives on the line for others. 
Their valiant efforts, courage, and 
heroism in the face of danger will never 
be forgotten. 
We remember their names and their 
stories always, and we rally with our 
new Gold Star families. 
My heart is also with our wounded 
soldiers, including Marine Corporal 
David Nick Traylor from La Habra in 
my 39th Congressional District. Thank-
fully, he is safe and is in good care. I 
am praying for safety for them and 
their loved ones.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MAJOR 
GENERAL ROBERT T. HERBERT 
(Mr. AMODEI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. AMODEI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the life and memory 
of my friend, Major General Robert T. 
Herbert, of the Nevada Army National 
Guard. 
An adopted Nevadan, Bob began a 42- 
year career in the U.S. Army in 1975 at 
the age of 18. After serving along the 
East-West German border, Bob moved 
to Nevada as a test pilot at the age of 
25. Later in his career, Bob served as 
senior policy adviser and director of 
appropriations for Senator Harry Reid, 
from 2001 to 2017. 
Bob loved anything with a loud en-
gine, having accrued more than 7,000 
flight hours as a pilot of both fixed and 
rotary-wing aircraft. He loved to ride 
his collection of motorcycles, took 
great pride in his customized truck, 
and was in the process of rebuilding a 
Pontiac Firebird. 
Both as a civilian and a soldier, Bob 
was respected and admired by anyone 
he interacted with, myself included. 
Simply put, Bob Herbert was an all- 
American consensus at everything he 
tried. 
I offer my condolences to his wife, 
Karen, his parents and family, and any-
one else who was lucky enough to call 
him a friend, including you, Madam 
Speaker. We will miss you, General.

TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS OF

PATRICIA 
BROWN 
AND SENIOR DEPUTY SHERIFF 
PAUL SHIFFER 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the tremendous 
achievements of two law enforcement 
officers in Stephens County, Georgia. 
Deputy Sheriff Lieutenant Patricia 
‘‘Pat’’ Brown recently reached her 30- 
year tenure with the Stephens County 
Sheriff’s Office. After serving in the 
field for many years, Lieutenant Brown 
now diligently leads the records divi-
sion and continues to display excep-
tional service to her community. 
Senior Deputy Sheriff Paul Shiffer 
reached his 50-year tenure this past 
year. Yes, I said 50 years of law en-
forcement service. And he continues to 
faithfully serve as head of the civil di-
vision. Whether he is working extra 
hours or using his personal time to cus-
tom make Christmas ornaments for 
each employee, Senior Deputy Shiffer 
has gone above and beyond to serve his 
community for half a century. 
The good folks of Stephens County 
are fortunate to have Deputies Brown

OPEN BORDERS AND AMNESTY IS 
THE END OF AMERICA 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, the Biden administration in-
tentionally opened our southern border 
and empowered drug cartels and human 
traffickers to flood illegal immigrants 
into our country with no vetting and 
no COVID testing or vaccine require-
ments. 
Secretary Mayorkas admitted on Fri-
day that the 12,000 Haitian migrants in 
Del Rio, Texas, who were released into 
the U.S., were not tested for COVID or 
subject to any vaccine mandates. 
President 
Biden 
and 
Secretary 
Blinken promised rigorous vetting for 
the Afghan nationals they flew into 
our country, but so far we have seen 
several arrested for sexually assaulting 
children and assaulting a female serv-
icemember while on U.S. soil. 
This is outrageous. 
The Biden administration has a dou-
ble standard, treating American citi-
zens worse than foreign nationals. 
This is what it means to put America 
last. 
Instead of addressing the root cause 
of Biden’s border crisis, House Demo-
crats are now ramming through Presi-
dent Biden’s reckless $4.3 trillion so-
cialist agenda, which includes amnesty 
and free college for illegal immigrants. 
Americans want secure borders and 
sound immigration. Open borders and 
amnesty is the end of America.

AMERICA’S DEBT IS BEING 
AUCTIONED 
(Mr. LONG asked and was given per-

Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, the 
Ways and Means Committee went in 
last Saturday to mark up a $3.5 trillion 
spending bill, and when they got done, 
they had a $4.3 trillion spending bill. 
I don’t know exactly how that hap-
pened, but I might have a suggestion 
on how it could have possibly hap-
pened. 
I am at a trillion. Now two, two tril-
lion. Now three. Are you able to buy $3 
trillion down here? Now 31⁄4. What do 
you go for? 31⁄2, 31⁄2. Now 4. Oh, 31⁄2, now 
4. At last call, 31⁄2. Oh, 4 trillion, 4–1, 4– 
1, 4.1, now 2. You can afford 2. 4.2. Now 
3. $4.2 trillion, and I have sold it for $4.3 
trillion. 
You know, Madam Speaker, Missou-
rian Harry Truman said, when you get 
elected to Congress, you spend your 
first 6 months up here thinking, wow, 
how did I ever get here? And then you 
spend the whole rest of your career

If you have watched the boondoggle

PRO-

S.

PROMOTING 
PHYSICAL 
ACTIVITY FOR AMERICANS ACT 
Mr. MCGOVERN, from the Com-
mittee on Rules, submitted a privi-
leged report (Rept. No. 117–133) on the 
resolution (H. Res. 688) providing for 
consideration of the bill (S. 1301) to 
provide for the publication by the Sec-

of physical activity recommendations 
for Americans, which was referred to 
the House Calendar and ordered to be

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF S. 1301, PROMOTING PHYSICAL 
ACTIVITY FOR AMERICANS ACT 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 688 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 688 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House bill (S. 1301) to provide for the publica-
tion by the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services of physical activity recommenda-
tions for Americans. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
An amendment in the nature of a substitute 
consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 117-16 shall be considered as adopted. 
The bill, as amended, shall be considered as 
read. All points of order against provisions 
in the bill, as amended, are waived. The pre-
vious question shall be considered as ordered 
on the bill, as amended, and on any further 
amendment thereto, to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means or their re-
spective designees; and (2) one motion to 
commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TITUS). The gentleman from Massachu-
setts is recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the distin-
guished 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
today the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 688, 
providing for consideration of S. 1301 
under a closed rule. The rule self-exe-
cutes an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute consisting of the text of 
Rules Committee Print 117–16, tempo-
rarily extending the public debt limit. 
The rule provides one hour of debate, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Ways and Means or 
their respective designees. Finally, the 
rule provides one motion to commit. 
Madam Speaker, having just sat 
through a Rules Committee meeting, it 
is a pleasant surprise that the Repub-
licans have now rediscovered the issue 
of the debt. Wow. 
Where the hell were you for the past 
4 years? 
Where was your concern when you all 
passed the tax cut bill for the wealthy 
and big corporations that CBO pro-
jected would add $1.9 trillion to the def-
icit? That is trillion with a T. And that 
is even after taking into account any 
effects from economic growth. 
Give me a break. 
Madam Speaker, the question before 
us today is this: Will the United States 
of America pay its bills? 
I wish that were hyperbole. 
We always have. The United States 
has never defaulted. Never, ever de-
faulted, not once. 
But the actions of my friends on the 
other side have made the world seri-
ously wonder about the full faith and 
credit of this Nation. 
Raising the debt ceiling has tradi-
tionally been something that both par-
ties have agreed to, no matter who con-
trolled Congress or who sat in the 
White House. 
I have been in Congress more than 20 
years now. I voted to raise the debt 
ceiling when I was in the majority, and 
I voted to raise the debt ceiling when I 
was in the minority. I voted to raise it 
under Democratic Presidents and Re-
publican Presidents, and I cast those 
votes even when I vehemently dis-
agreed with our spending decisions. 
I opposed the Republican tax cut for 
the wealthy and large corporations 
that passed under the last administra-
tion. I still think it is awful, awful, 
awful policy; but I still, nevertheless, 
voted to raise the debt ceiling under 
the prior administration because re-
gardless whether we win or lose on pol-
icy here, defaulting on our debt would 
lead to economic catastrophe on a 
global scale. 
b 1230 
Unemployment would rise; the stock 
market would crater; interest rates 
would skyrocket; imports would be-
come more expensive; and inflation 
would increase. 
We are not talking about a scenario 
that only impacts wealthy investors or

smartphone. Our country would be 
thrown into a recession virtually over-
night. 
This is the type of disaster that Re-
publicans 
are 
flirting 
with 
here, 
Madam Speaker. They are not refusing 
to raise the debt ceiling to try to pre-
vent President Biden’s agenda in the 
future. This isn’t about the bipartisan 
transportation bill or reconciliation 
bill, which we have yet to consider, be-
cause raising the debt ceiling only pays 
for the prior debts that we have al-
ready racked up. We are talking about 
the spending Republicans voted for 
under President Trump. 
They ballooned the deficit, and now 
they are trying to wash their hands of 
the consequences. It is like going to a 
restaurant, eating a meal, and refusing 
to pay the tab when the waiter brings 
the bill. Only here, they risk bringing 
down the entire global economy. 
All because of what? They are upset 
that their party doesn’t control Con-
gress. Give me a break. We are talking 
about people’s livelihoods here. 
Earlier this week, Senate Repub-
licans filibustered a continuing resolu-
tion that would have lifted the debt 
ceiling. Every day Republicans waste 
playing political games brings us one 
day closer to a default, one day closer 
to catastrophe. 
I have heard the Senate minority 
leader and others suggest that rec-
onciliation is some kind of panacea 
that will allow us to raise the debt ceil-
ing easily and in a partisan way. Well, 
let me remind them that there are 
challenges with that, and it will take 
time, time that we do not have. 
Just yesterday, the Treasury Sec-
retary said that we are likely to hit 
the debt limit on October 18, just days 
from now. 
We have had a lot of fights on this 
floor. Congress has been a little dys-
functional from time to time. But let 
me repeat, the United States of Amer-
ica has never defaulted in its more 
than 200-year history. Not once. 
Republicans are playing with fire 
here. We need cooler heads to prevail. 
The underlying bill is that chance. It is 
an opportunity to raise the debt ceiling 
in a clean way, the kind of approach 
that would have passed overwhelm-
ingly on suspension a few years ago. 
We need to get this done, Madam 
Speaker. We don’t have a moment to 
spare. Economists estimate that de-
faulting on our debts even for just a 
few hours could cost taxpayers hun-
dreds of billions of dollars over the 
next decade. 
After all that we have done to bring 
our Nation through the COVID pan-
demic, that is a hit that we can’t af-
ford, Madam Speaker. 
So, to my friends on the other side, I 
get it. You are not going to vote for 
this even though 97 percent of what is 
necessitating us to raise the debt ceil-
ing was accumulated before President 
Biden even took office. Much of it was 
racked up under President Trump on 
your watch when you controlled the 
Congress. 
Still, you are not going to vote to do 
the responsible thing here. That is 
crystal clear. But please get out of the 
way and tell all your friends in the 
Senate to get out of the way, too. 
Let us pass this. Let us do the re-
sponsible thing. 
We will do it with a Democratic ma-
jority in the House and the Senate. We 
are good at cleaning up your mess. 
Let’s pass this rule and the under-
lying legislation. Let’s step back from 
the brink. Let’s prevent an avoidable 
economic meltdown. And let’s do what 
America has always done: pay its bills. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN), my very good friend, 
the distinguished chairman of the 
Rules Committee, for yielding me the 
customary 30 minutes, and I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule covers 
a standalone bill that suspends the na-
tional debt limit through the end of 
2022. 
Today’s item does not come out of a 
vacuum. Just last week, the Demo-
cratic majority in the House passed a 
continuing resolution to fund the gov-
ernment through early December. Un-
fortunately, that bill also included this 
same suspension of the debt ceiling 
through 2022. The inclusion of this item 
meant that not a single Republican in 
the House supported last week’s bill, 
and not a single Republican in the Sen-
ate supported it either. 
But today, not content with having 
run headlong into a brick wall once, 
the majority is now seeking to do the 
same thing again. As baseball player 
and philosopher Yogi Berra once said, 
today is truly deja vu all over again. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know how 
much more clear Republicans can be on 
this topic. So long as the Democratic 
majority continues to insist on spend-
ing money hand over fist, Republicans 
will refuse to help them lift the debt 
ceiling. 
This year alone, the majority has 
rammed through one partisan spending 
bill through reconciliation already. 
That bill spent $1.9 trillion, allegedly 
for COVID relief, but really about a 
laundry list of progressive policy prior-
ities. And I remind my friends they 
were offered a compromise of many 
hundreds of billions of dollars, but that 
wasn’t sufficient. 
Today, the majority is neck-deep in 
negotiations on an even bigger partisan 
reconciliation bill, this one supposedly 
$3.5 trillion but, frankly, likely to run 
much higher than that. If passed, this 
one 
would 
mean 
Democrats 
have 
pushed through $51⁄2 trillion of spending 
in 1 year, which is almost one-and-a- 
half times the amount of normal Fed-
eral spending. And that all comes on 
top of our regular discretionary and 
nondiscretionary spending. 
Madam Speaker, Republicans have 
been very clear on this for months. So 
long as Democrats keep pushing these 
bloated spending measures, and so long 
as they continue to ram through par-
tisan policies like those found in the 
Green New Deal, Republicans will not 
work with them to raise the debt limit. 
Since the beginning of this year, 
Democrats have been pushing their pol-
icy agenda despite having the bare 
minimum of a majority in both the 
House and the Senate. The results have 
been shocking: more Big Government 
socialism, more spending, and higher 
taxes. They have been doing all this on 
their own, with only Democrats voting 
for these measures. 
To be clear, this is the choice the ma-
jority has made. They have chosen to 
govern in a majority-rules fashion. 
They are pushing through bill after bill 
larded up with huge spending and more 
and more Big Government socialism all 
on their own. The majority also has 
the power to lift the debt ceiling all on 
their own, using a process they are 
quite familiar with, reconciliation. 
Since they have chosen to ram the 
rest of their agenda through on their 
own, they also have the responsibility 
to lift the debt ceiling on their own. If 
they want to keep spending the peo-
ple’s money like this, then they alone 
must act and take responsibility. 
Madam Speaker, my good friend al-
luded to the fact that he has repeatedly 
voted for debt ceiling increases in his 
capacity as a Member. I know that to 
be true, and I respect my friend. I have 
done that myself. I have voted under 
both Republicans and Democrats. But I 
do want to address this point about the 
debt limit. 
The point was best summed up by 
Speaker PELOSI in her Dear Colleague 
letter Sunday night. ‘‘The debt limit is 
a shared responsibility, and I urge Con-
gress to come together . . . on a bipar-
tisan basis, as it has in the past.’’ Oh, 
really? I think we should look at the 
record and clear that up. 
The last five times that Congress 
voted on raising the debt limit when 
Republicans 
controlled 
the 
White 
House, the Senate, and the House, 
President Biden, who was then in the 
Senate, didn’t vote to raise it a single 
time. Majority Leader SCHUMER voted 
to raise it once out of five times. The 
Democratic leadership voted to raise it 
once out of five times. 
So to somehow pretend that both 
sides have not on occasion used the 
debt ceiling to express their concerns 
or that everybody has rallied to the 
cause simply does not square with the 
facts. 
Madam Speaker, I will make a bold 
prediction. I suspect the debt ceiling 
will at some point get raised, and I sus-
pect it will be before we reach a dead-
line. And I share my friend’s point 
that, indeed, that needs to happen. 
However, when you launch a program 
as expensive and as expansive as the 
Democrats have, and you choose to do 
it on a partisan line way, then don’t 
shirk the responsibility at the end of 
the day. Don’t try to shift it to others. 
I think that is what is happening here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5520 
September 29, 2021 
One last point, Madam Speaker. We 
talk a lot about the Trump debt. I re-
mind my friends they were in control 
the last 2 years of the Trump Presi-
dency. I remind my friends that most 
of the debt was actually accumulated 
in that time. And I do remind my 
friends it was a bipartisan effort. The 
biggest part of that debt was COVID re-
lief, which we agreed on, on both sides 
of the aisle and both supported, and we 
raised the debt ceiling for it. 
So, when we work together, we can 
solve these problems. My friends have 
chosen not to work with us, and I think 
now they are going to have to bear the 
responsibility. I am sure they are up to 
the task. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me say this, and let me preface 
my remarks by saying I love the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma. He is one of 
my favorite people here in the Con-
gress. But I would remind him that 
when the Republicans passed their ex-
pensive tax cut for the rich, for the 
very wealthy, for big corporations, 
they didn’t work with us. They just 
shoved it through. As I mentioned ear-
lier, CBO tells us that the addition to 
our debt is close to $2 trillion, and that 
is after taking into account any poten-
tial benefits from growth. 
I didn’t like that policy. I still don’t 
like that policy. I think the rich al-
ready get enough, and I think big cor-
porations get too much in this country. 
But nonetheless, my view did not pre-
vail. 
Then, when we had to vote on the 
debt ceiling, the issue was: Do we pay 
our bills? 
Now, this is a quote from the distin-
guished Minority Leader KEVIN MCCAR-
THY. Let me read it. He says: ‘‘When 
the United States makes promises, it 
keeps them, which is why the House 
voted today to avoid the threat of a 
debt default.’’ 
That was several years ago, but he is 
right. When the United States makes 
promises, it keeps them. I didn’t think 
that was a partisan issue. I didn’t 
think that that was controversial. 
But, look, here we are in Washington. 
Everything is a political fight. I mean, 
that is the way this place seems to 
work nowadays. And I get it. I am not 
even asking Republicans to vote with 
us to raise the debt ceiling anymore. I 
mean, it is just a hopeless cause. They 
have made a political decision. I get it. 
So, we are not asking for your support. 
What we are asking for is for you to 
get out of the way. 
In the Senate, Democrats are pre-
pared to carry the burden and raise the 
debt ceiling to make sure we pay bills, 
97 percent of which were accumulated 
before Joe Biden was President. We are 
still paying for the Trump tax cuts. 
We will do it. We will clean up the 
mess. What we are asking for is for you 
to get out of the way. Yet, we have 
Senators now threatening to use the 
filibuster to try to derail this, to put 
one hurdle after another after another. 
They said they wanted Democrats to 
bear the burden. Democrats will do it. 
We always do. We are good at cleaning 
up messes that are left for us by our 
Republican friends. But get out of the 
way. Get out of the way, and let us do 
what the American people expect us to 
do, and that is to pay our bills. 
Let me say one other thing. Every-
body keeps telling me—and I heard this 
on the Rules Committee, too—the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill and the 
reconciliation, unless I missed some-
thing, we haven’t passed either one of 
them yet. I mean, hopefully, we will, 
but those are things we are going to do 
in the future. 
By the way, on the reconciliation 
bill, we are doing something that my 
Republican friends refused to do on 
their tax cut bill, and that is we are 
paying for it. So, we understood the 
issue of the debt, I guess, long before 
they did. At least we are more con-
sistent than my Republican friends are. 
In any event, I would just again say 
to my friends, we are not even asking 
you to vote for this anymore because 
that is a hopeless cause at this point. 
We are just asking you to get out of 
the way so we can get this done. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1245 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, just to quickly re-
spond to my friend, I remind him, his 
leadership didn’t vote to raise the debt 
ceiling. I remind him four out of the 
last five times we had complete con-
trol. I remind him that the majority 
leader in the United States, Mr. SCHU-
MER, didn’t vote for it four out of five 
times. And I remind him that then- 
Senator Biden didn’t vote for it once. 
So please, please, let’s look at the 
facts here before we start saying how 
much Democrats have always bellied 
up to the bar to help us out. That is 
just simply not the case. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to bring up H.R. 1897 
for immediate consideration. This bill 
is simple: Before the Biden administra-
tion can release any illegal immigrant 
from custody, the person must have a 
negative COVID–19 test. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration’s crisis at the southern border 
is not only a humanitarian and a secu-
rity crisis, but it is also a public health 
crisis. 
Just last week, Secretary Mayorkas 
admitted that 12,000 migrants in Del 
Rio, Texas, who were released by the 
Biden administration, were not tested 
for COVID–19 and were not subject to 
any vaccination or testing mandates. 
This stands in stark contrast with the 
CDC’s continuing embrace of mask 
mandates, even for the vaccinated. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
the extraneous material immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS), my good friend 
and author of this bill, to further ex-
plain the amendment. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
yielding me the time on this critical 
issue. I would say to the gentleman 
from Massachusetts that I am also giv-
ing him the opportunity to urge all of 
our colleagues to defeat the previous 
question so we can take up the bill, 
H.R. 1897, the REACT Act. 
My commonsense legislation would 
require the Department of Homeland 
Security to test all migrants illegally 
crossing our border who they plan to 
release 
into 
our 
communities 
for 
COVID–19. 
I have traveled to the U.S.-Mexico 
border twice this year. On both trips, I 
have spoken with the brave men and 
women serving in Customs and Border 
Protection and also the physicians who 
are stationed there. I saw the crisis 
they are facing firsthand. I believe that 
it is our Congressional responsibility 
to address this crisis and support our 
officers. 
Earlier this month, the DHS Office of 
Inspector General called for the De-
partment to improve COVID–19 detec-
tion and prevention measures at the 
U.S.-Mexico border amid record-setting 
migrant arrivals. I even inquired of 
Secretary 
Mayorkas 
in 
a 
hearing 
whether or not testing was being done, 
and he alluded and gave the allusion 
that there was testing. However, to 
quote directly from the report, ‘‘CBP 
does not conduct COVID–19 for mi-
grants who enter CBP custody and is 
not required to do so.’’ 
The report further stated that: ‘‘We 
recommended DHS reassess its COVID– 
19 response framework to identify 
areas for improvement to mitigate the 
spread of COVID–19 while balancing its 
primary mission of securing the bor-
der.’’ 
Currently, everyone legally entering 
the United States by plane is required 
to display a negative test for COVID– 
19. Why aren’t we requiring this of 
those who come here illegally? 
Numerous public health officials— 
and I am one—have stated that the 
failure of the U.S. authorities to test 
adult migrants for the coronavirus in 
jam-packed border processing centers 
is creating a potential for new trans-
missions, including among migrants 
who may have arrived healthy at 
America’s door. 
The administration has correctly rec-
ognized the need to test individuals ar-
riving from Afghanistan—and not only 
are they tested, they are vaccinated for

COVID–19 and other childhood ill-
nesses—but it does not seem to under-
stand the importance of doing the same 
to those crossing our border illegally. 
In August, more than 208,000 mi-
grants were encountered along the 
southwest border. This means each 
day, approximately 6,700 individuals 
were encountered. To put this in per-
spective, President Obama’s Secretary 
of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, 
stated in his tenure that 1,000 appre-
hensions a day was considered a bad 
day. We are at more than six times 
that now, and on top of that, we con-
tinue to face a global pandemic. 
I applaud the work being done by the 
CBP 
agents 
and 
officers 
working 
around the clock to keep this country 
safe and healthy. I will also do what-
ever I can to support their work. 
We recently watched a debacle unfold 
in Del Rio, Texas, where we have 
learned that DHS did not test any of 
approximately 
15,000 
migrants 
who 
camped out under the Del Rio Bridge, 
many of whom who came from South 
America where they are experiencing 
the lambda variant. We now know that 
around 12,000 of these individuals were 
released into the United States. 
Right now, the majority is preparing 
a reckless multi-trillion-dollar tax- 
and-spend package. None of the money 
in that legislation would go to CBP, de-
spite the DHS Inspector General clear-
ly stating that CBP officials do not 
have the necessary resources to con-
duct testing. 
If the majority already wants to 
spend trillions upon trillions, why not 
include money to support CBP and 
testing for COVID–19? 
The current lack of testing at our 
border is completely unacceptable and 
irresponsible. It puts the health and 
safety of CBP border communities, mi-
grants, and all Americans at risk. The 
current lack of testing is unacceptable. 
Madam Speaker, for this reason, I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support my legislation, the 
REACT Act, by voting ‘‘no’’ on the pre-
vious question. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, we 
are talking about whether or not the 
United States of America will pay its 
bills and not default. I mean, that is 
what this is about. And we could talk 
about this, but with all due respect to 
the gentlewoman from Iowa, if we want 
to solve this pandemic, it begins at 
home. 
She represents a State where just 
maybe a little more than 50 percent are 
vaccinated. 
Go home and tell your people to get 
vaccinated. 
It is the unvaccinated in this country 
that are filling up our emergency 
rooms, that are allowing this disease to 
be able to mutate. 
So there’s that old saying, ‘‘physi-
cian, heal thyself,’’ and to hear this 
from a party that embraces the con-
spiracy theories that are out there that 
are discouraging people from getting 
vaccinated. But I would encourage the 
gentlewoman—we can talk about this 
at another time—but in the meantime, 
Iowa needs to do better, as well as 
many other States in this country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOG-
GETT). 
Mr. 
DOGGETT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I am voting to approve legisla-
tion to cover massive costs incurred by 
the self-described ‘‘King of Debt’’ for 
wasteful tax expenditures that we, 
Democrats, strongly opposed. 
While his other claim to be ‘‘a stable 
genius’’ never had an ounce of credi-
bility, Trump has indeed earned the 
undisputed title, ‘‘King of Debt.’’ 
Republicans have a ‘‘dine and dash’’ 
strategy—run up a tab for a massive 
feast for the wealthiest one percent, 
and then dodge the bill to cover it. It is 
surely a new low. 
More than $2 trillion for a massive 
tax scam. Multinational corporations 
in America today, thanks to their she-
nanigans, now pay an effective tax rate 
of less than 8 percent, with 55 corpora-
tions paying absolutely nothing on $40 
billion in combined profits. That is the 
equity that they added to our Tax Code 
as working families around this coun-
try paid their fair share. 
Even more public debt was incurred 
as we rightly responded to help Ameri-
cans recover from Trump’s pandemic 
incompetence. After ignoring COVID 
and sound medical advice from his own 
scientific advisors, then refusing the 
most basic public health measures, his 
failed mismanagement has been dev-
astating to our country, both in lives 
and in dollars—hundreds of thousands 
of American lives. They are marked 
out on the Mall today with white flags 
all around the Washington Monument, 
and they have taken a toll on one 
American family after another. 
Last year, it was bleach; this year, it 
is horse dewormer. You could not make 
this stuff up. 
While there is no limit to the duplic-
ity 
of 
those 
that 
are 
politically 
enraptured by the Trump personality 
cult—those with so little commitment 
to American democracy that they 
refuse to recognize the result of the 
last national election and continue 
promoting the big lie, there is a statu-
tory limit that this Congress faces for 
our national debt. 
Today, it must be raised in recogni-
tion of all the damage that Trump and 
his delusional cohorts have wreaked on 
our country. Putting ‘‘America First’’ 
or ‘‘Making It Great’’ surely includes 
not driving it off a cliff into a self-in-
flicted, politically-motivated financial 
disaster. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I am sure my friend from Massachu-
setts is not aware of this, but Mrs. MIL-
LER-MEEKS has actually run multiple 
events for vaccines. She has vaccinated 
people herself. She has spent 24 years 
in public health in service to the coun-
try. 
So I agree with you about the vac-
cine. Nobody in this body has done 
more to promote it and administer it 
than Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
Tennessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER), my 
very good friend, to speak more about 
the need to ensure illegal immigrants 
are tested for COVID–19 before being 
released. 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous 
question so that we could immediately 
consider H.R. 1897, the REACT Act. It 
is urgent that we pass this critical and 
commonsense legislation offered by my 
friend and colleague from Iowa, Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
We all know that the crisis on our 
southern border is a national security 
crisis. My colleague, Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS is a physician and I am a phar-
macist, so we totally understand. What 
is less discussed is that it is also a pub-
lic health crisis. Illegal immigrants are 
coming across our southern border in 
record numbers and they are coming 
from countries with low COVID vac-
cination rates. 
My colleagues are right. The ERs are 
full of a lot of unvaccinated people, be-
cause there are 200,000 or more coming 
across 
the 
southern 
border 
every 
month and 209,000 were encountered in 
August alone. And the Biden adminis-
tration is then transporting these ille-
gal immigrants to communities all 
across our country—in most cases, 
without the Governor’s approval, as is 
in Tennessee. 
Currently, there is no requirement 
for individuals released by CBP or ICE 
to test negative for COVID before they 
are released. That means that any 
COVID-positive migrants released by 
the 
administration 
are 
spreading 
COVID throughout our communities. 
Just this week, the DHS Secretary 
admitted that there were at least 12,000 
or more Haitian migrants released into 
our communities who were not subject 
to COVID testing mandates—and I 
won’t even talk about the non-SIV Af-
ghans. 
Contrast this with the Biden admin-
istration’s policy of forcing American 
workers to get tested or vaccinated or 
its policy of only letting fully vac-
cinated tourists fly into our country. 
The lack of COVID testing at the 
southern border is reckless and it is 
unacceptable, and it is a detriment to 
our healthcare system. 
But it doesn’t have to be this way. 
There is a solution to the border health 
crisis. 
My friend from Iowa introduced the 
REACT Act to protect American public 
health from the border crisis. This crit-
ical bill would require testing for ev-
eryone crossing our border, and it 
would require a negative test before 
CBP or ICE can release these illegal 
immigrants from custody. 
The ultimate solution is just to close 
the border, but since that is a common-
sense solution, it is not going to hap-

entering our country and stop putting 
Americans at risk. 
Madam Speaker, the House should 
immediately pass the REACT Act be-
cause lives depend on it. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, we are on the edge 
of default, on the edge of catastrophe, 
and this is the response from my Re-
publican friends. 
Madam Speaker, yes, I have nothing 
but the highest respect for the gentle-
woman from Iowa, but I just pointed 
out that a little over 50 percent of her 
State is vaccinated. That is not good. 
And the gentlewoman from Tennessee 
who just spoke, her State is even 
worse—something like 45 percent are 
fully vaccinated. That is dangerous for 
not only the people of Iowa and Ten-
nessee, but for the people of this coun-
try. 
Doctor after doctor after doctor have 
told us that this is spreading because 
of the lack of attention to getting peo-
ple vaccinated in this country. So we 
need to do better. 
What we are talking about here 
today is whether or not we are going to 
default, whether we are going to court 
a catastrophe. 
Madam Speaker, I will say to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma, he went 
through a list of people who voted 
against raising the debt ceiling in the 
past. I am willing to bet that many of 
those were attached to policy items 
where there was an objection. 
I don’t recall Democrats threatening 
to 
filibuster—threatening 
to 
fili-
buster—raising the debt ceiling. And 
yet, that is what Republicans are 
doing, cheered on by Republicans in 
the House. 
So, look, we are happy to clean up 
your mess. We are happy to do the 
right thing. All Democrats will vote for 
it in the House. I am not asking any-
more for you to join us because it is a 
waste of my breath. 
But what we are asking you to do is 
get out of the way so that something 
really horrible doesn’t happen in this 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1300 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, to my good friend 
from Massachusetts, if we want to deal 
with urgent matters, why don’t we pass 
a clean CR and make sure the govern-
ment doesn’t shut down in 48 hours. 
That is urgent. And hopefully we will 
be able to get about that business 
shortly. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS), my very good friend and fellow 
Rules Committee member, classmate, 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, who has been a passionate 
advocate on this issue and who will 
speak more about the previous ques-
tion. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, please inform the 
White House that there is a crisis along 
our southern border. That is why de-
feating the previous question is so im-
portant, so we can take up this amend-
ment. 
More than 1 billion undocumented 
immigrants crossed the southern bor-
der this year, including hundreds of 
thousands in the last several months. 
It is the highest level in years. In the 
most recent accounting, over 15,000 il-
legal immigrants, the majority origi-
nating from the country of Haiti, were 
camped under a bridge in Del Rio. They 
had no food. They had no water. They 
had no sanitation. They had no shelter. 
The Biden administration admitted 
in 12,000 of these migrants and Sec-
retary Mayorkas admitted that not a 
single one was vaccinated or tested for 
the coronavirus. 
It is unconscionable that thousands 
of migrants continue to stream across 
our border without being tested while 
the Biden administration implements 
mandates for masks and mandates for 
vaccines for American citizens. But 
this not only contradicts the guidance 
from our public health authorities, but 
it puts American citizens at risk and 
their communities in danger. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
have 
offered 
amendments several times throughout 
consideration of the reconciliation bill 
that we previously passed, the America 
Rescue Plan, and during the markup of 
the Build Back Better plan in the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee to pro-
vide funding for and require testing of 
migrants entering along our southern 
border. Every time Democrats voted 
against this commonsense amendment. 
So it is hypocritical to declare that 
Americans 
must 
take 
precautions, 
Americans must be subject to man-
dates to protect public health, while al-
lowing non-Americans, noncitizens, to 
roam free into the country without so 
much as a temperature check. 
Representative MILLER-MEEKS’ bill 
will require a negative coronavirus test 
before any immigrant without proper 
documentation can be released from 
custody. As you know, currently the 
procedure is catch and release. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this 
Nation was built by immigrants. And 
we take in, legally and lawfully, over a 
million immigrants each year; more 
than any other country. But those 
seeking to come here must follow our 
laws, must follow our current regula-
tions. 
Unfortunately, they do not get to 
cross the border just because they want 
to; they must acquire proper docu-
mentation and take precautions to pro-
tect public health, as is currently re-
quired by all other Americans by the 
Biden administration. 
Madam Speaker, so I urge my fellow 
Members to vote against the previous 
question so we can immediately take 
up this important bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
just want to point out for the record 
that in Texas only 51 percent of the 
population is fully vaccinated. That is 
better than Tennessee, but still that 
means half the population. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman will notice that the primary 
county that I represent, Denton Coun-
ty, has a significantly higher vaccina-
tion rate because we put together a 
vaccine hub at Texas Motor Speedway. 
We are very grateful for the participa-
tion of all members of the community. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
merely point out that we have a lot of 
work to do in this country to be able to 
control the virus. 
Madam Speaker, I also include in the 
RECORD
a letter to Speaker PELOSI 
from Janet Yellen, who is the Sec-
retary of the Treasury. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, 
Washington, DC, September 28, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I am writing to fol-
low up on my previous letters regarding the 
debt limit and to provide additional informa-
tion regarding the Department of the Treas-
ury’s ability to continue to finance the oper-
ations of the U.S. government. 
In my September 8 letter, I explained that 
Treasury’s cash and extraordinary measures 
would most likely be exhausted sometime 
during the month of October. Based on our 
most recent information, including tax pay-
ments associated with the September 15 
deadline for third quarter estimated tax pay-
ments for businesses and individuals, I am 
now able to further refine that projection. 
We now estimate that Treasury is likely to 
exhaust its extraordinary measures if Con-
gress has not acted to raise or suspend the 
debt limit by October 18. At that point, we 
expect Treasury would be left with very lim-
ited resources that would be depleted quick-
ly. It is uncertain whether we could continue 
to meet all the nation’s commitments after 
that date. While this is our best estimate, 
the federal government’s cash flows are sub-
ject to unavoidable variability. For example, 
the government’s daily gross cash flow (ex-
cluding financing) over the past year aver-
ages nearly $50 billion per day and has ex-
ceeded $300 billion. As a result, it is impor-
tant to remember that estimates regarding 
how long our remaining extraordinary meas-
ures and cash may last can unpredictably 
shift forward or backward. This uncertainty 
underscores the critical importance of not 
waiting to raise or suspend the debt limit. 
The full faith and credit of the United States 
should not be put at risk. 
Furthermore, we know from previous debt 
limit impasses that waiting until the last 
minute can cause serious harm to business 
and consumer confidence, raise borrowing 
costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact 
the credit rating of the United States for 
years to come. Failure to act promptly could 
also result in substantial disruptions to fi-
nancial markets, as heightened uncertainty 
can exacerbate volatility and erode investor 
confidence. 
I am also writing to notify you, pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 8348(1)(2), of my determination

that, by reason of the statutory debt limit, I 
will continue to be unable to fully invest the 
portion of the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund (CSRDF) not immediately 
required to pay beneficiaries, and that a 
‘‘debt issuance suspension period,’’ pre-
viously determined to end on September 30, 
2021, will continue through October 18, 2021. 
As a result, the Treasury Department will 
continue to suspend additional investments 
of amounts credited to, and will redeem an 
additional portion of the investment held by, 
the CSRDF, as authorized by law. 
In addition, because the Postal Account-
ability and Enhancement Act of 2006 pro-
vides that investments in the Postal Service 
Retiree Health Benefits Fund (PSRHBF) 
shall be made in the same manner as invest-
ments for the CSRDF, the Treasury Depart-
ment will also continue to suspend addi-
tional investments of amounts credited to, 
and will redeem an additional portion of the 
investments held by, the PSRHBF. By law, 
the CSRDF and PSRHBF will be made whole 
once the debt limit is increased or sus-
pended. Federal retirees and employees will 
be unaffected by these actions. 
Again, I respectfully urge Congress to pro-
tect the full faith and credit of the United 
States by acting as soon as possible. 
Sincerely, 
JANET L. YELLEN. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me quote from the letter. It says: ‘‘We 
know from previous debt limit im-
passes that waiting until the last 
minute can cause serious harm to busi-
ness and consumer confidence, raise 
borrowing costs for taxpayers, and neg-
atively impact the credit rating of the 
United States for years to come. Fail-
ure to act promptly could also result in 
substantial disruptions to financial 
markets, as heightened uncertainly 
can exacerbate volatility and erode in-
vestor confidence.’’ 
We are not asking you to do anything 
more other than to just step out of the 
way. We will do the serious business of 
making sure that we don’t default on 
our financial obligations. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I just 
want to quickly inquire of my friend. I 
am prepared to close, if my friend is. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, could I 
have a quick time check? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oklahoma has 121⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I can as-
sure Members I won’t use it all. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to 
quickly point out to my friend who has 
cited a number of statistics on State 
vaccinations, and I agree with him. Ev-
eryone should be vaccinated. I spend a 
lot of time in my district urging people 
to do that. I know my good friend from 
Massachusetts does the same thing. 
But with respect to the previous 
question, nobody is vaccinated that is 
coming across illegally. They are not 
tested, and they are not vaccinated. 
This is really a commonsense item. I 
am surprised, quite frankly, my friends 
have not accepted this in some earlier 
iteration. My friend, Dr. BURGESS, 
mentioned he brought it up multiple 
times. This is actually something we 
should agree on. 
Let’s not just let anybody into our 
country that has not been tested. And 
if they are found unvaccinated, give 
them the vaccine. I think we can argue 
about immigration all day long. I don’t 
know why in the world we argue about 
that particular issue at all. What my 
friend from Iowa is proposing is very 
much common sense. 
Madam Speaker, the bill before us 
today is a deeply misguided bill. It 
makes in order one item, a standalone 
bill lifting the debt ceiling through the 
end of 2022. 
Republicans have been very clear on 
their stance. So long as Democrats 
continue to spend, spend, spend on par-
tisan reconciliation bills, Republicans 
will not act to help them lift the debt 
ceiling. The majority has been gov-
erning in a partisan manner since they 
took control earlier this year. That is 
their prerogative. 
If they continue to insist on ram-
ming their big government socialist 
agenda through Congress on narrow 
partisan votes, then it becomes their 
responsibility to lift the debt limit on 
their own. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, let me remind my 
colleagues that MITCH MCCONNELL led 
three efforts to increase the debt limit 
under President Trump. He has voted 
over 30 times to increase the debt limit 
by over $20 trillion during his career. 
He worked with President Obama in 
2015, saying then: I made it very clear 
that after the November election we 
are certainly not going to shut down 
the government or default on the na-
tional debt. We will figure some way to 
handle that. What is different now? Not 
a thing. Nothing. 
He did the right thing then. He is 
simply unwilling to do the right thing 
today. Instead, he is making up new 
precedent out of whole cloth, the im-
pacts of which would be devastating. 
So this is not just about Senator 
MCCONNELL, every Republican in the 
House and Senate should do the right 
thing and raise the debt ceiling. 
It has never been the responsibility 
of just one party to ensure that Amer-
ica pays its bills. And to pretend other-
wise, is to blindly be following a policy 
that will send our economy off a cliff. 
Madam Speaker, I just have to say to 
my Republican friends, stop doubling 
down on the insanity. At some point we 
all have to act like grownups around 
here and get the people’s business done. 
Too many of my friends on the other 
side of the aisle continue to get on one 
knee and genuflect in front of the altar 
of Donald Trump and all the stuff that 
goes with that. Well, you know what, it 
is time that we all act like serious leg-
islators. 
We have a discussion on immigration 
and COVID testing, we ought to have 
that discussion in a different context, 
not on the debt ceiling bill. 
I will again say to my colleagues, I 
don’t even know how many Members of 
the Republican Conference are vac-
cinated. We have people who come here 
and fight against efforts to get every-
body vaccinated, who fight against 
communities that want to encourage 
people to wear masks in order to pro-
tect the citizens of that community. 
We are here to legislate. This bill 
will fulfill one of the most basic re-
sponsibilities Congress has; that is, to 
ensure that America pays its bills. We 
always have, Madam Speaker. 
And, you know, to try to make this 
debate into a debate about reconcili-
ation—by the way, which we want to 
pay for as much of it as possible so it 
won’t add to the deficit and the debt. 
That is a future debate. 
This is about paying all the bills that 
were accumulated; 97 percent of which 
was accumulated, not under Joe Biden, 
but under his predecessor. Stuff that 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle voted for. And to turn this into a 
political football about what might 
happen down the road is really ridicu-
lous. It is dangerous. It is reckless. 
My friends have said that they want 
Democrats to basically carry these 
bills. Happy to do it. On our side no-
body wants to default. On our side we 
all understand the consequences. Mark 
Zandi, an economist for Moody’s, said 
that it would be such a catastrophe if 
we defaulted on our debt. He said it 
would impact generations and genera-
tions and generations into the future. 
Every economist, no matter what 
their political affiliation may be, has 
said the same thing. So we have to do 
this. 
And, again, to try to make this about 
something else is just trying to avoid 
dealing with reality. I would say to my 
colleagues, all we are asking for now— 
we are no longer asking for your vote— 
you know, that is a waste of time at 
this particular point. I have seen all 
the press releases. I have seen the talk-
ing points come out of the RCCC and 
the RNC. It is maddening to see how 
this issue can be so distorted. We are 
not asking for that anymore. You al-
ready decided to make this a political 
issue. 
We are just asking you to get the hell 
out of the way and to allow us to keep 
this government running on track and 
not in default. That should not be a 
controversial issue. It should not be an 
issue that people walk away from. 
When you accumulate bills, you got to 
pay for them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for this rule so we can 
prevent a completely avoidable eco-
nomic meltdown.

PROMOTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 
FOR AMERICANS ACT 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 688, I call up the 
bill (S. 1301) to provide for the publica-
tion by the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services of physical activity 
recommendations for Americans, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD). Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 688, an amendment in the nature 
of a substitute consisting of the text of 
Rules Committee Print 117–16, is con-
sidered as adopted, and the bill, as 
amended, is considered read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
S. 1301 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC 
DEBT LIMIT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 3101(b) of title 31, 
United States Code, shall not apply for the pe-
riod beginning on the date of the enactment of 
this Act and ending on December 16, 2022. 
(b) SPECIAL RULE RELATING TO OBLIGATIONS 
ISSUED DURING EXTENSION PERIOD.—Effective 
on December 17, 2022, the limitation in effect 
under section 3101(b) of title 31, United States 
Code, shall be increased to the extent that— 
(1) the face amount of obligations issued 
under chapter 31 of such title and the face 
amount of obligations whose principal and in-
terest are guaranteed by the United States Gov-
ernment (except guaranteed obligations held by 
the Secretary of the Treasury) outstanding on 
December 17, 2022, exceeds 
(2) the face amount of such obligations out-
standing on the date of the enactment of this 
Act. 
(c) EXTENSION LIMITED TO NECESSARY OBLI-
GATIONS.—An obligation shall not be taken into 
account under subsection (b)(1) unless the 
issuance of such obligation was necessary to 
fund a commitment incurred pursuant to law by 
the Federal Government that required payment 
before December 17, 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Ways and 
Means or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL) and the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BRADY) each will control 30 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 1301. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, one of the essential 
duties of Congress is to preserve the 
full faith and credit of the United 
States. Today, we will once again take 
action to do precisely that. 
A suspension of the debt ceiling will 
prevent us from defaulting on debt we 
already owe. This is not about new 
spending. It is about investments that 
this Congress has agreed to in the past 
and previously approved. 
This is about what the American 
family does every day. They don’t get 
to say: ‘‘I am not going to make my 
credit card payment this month. I am 
not going to make my mortgage pay-
ment this month. Oh, maybe I won’t 
make my car payment this month. And 
I won’t honor the personal loan that I 
signed up for.’’ 
Our vote today is not a novel exer-
cise. Congress has addressed the debt 
limit 78 times since 1960 to prevent de-
fault, 29 times with a Democrat in the 
White House and 49 times with a Re-
publican in the White House. 
Ensuring that the government can fi-
nance its existing obligations is a re-
sponsibility that we share jointly in 
this Chamber. Regrettably, that appar-
ently is not the case this time. 
Our Democratic Caucus, with some 
hope and help, I believe, from the Re-
publicans at the right moment, will 
meet the moment and prevent a dev-
astating financial catastrophe. We will 
take the action necessary to protect 
businesses, workers, and families. 
When Americans’ jobs and retirement 
savings are on the line, we are going to 
make sure we do what is necessary to 
prevent disaster. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage every 
Member to support this critical meas-
ure, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today’s debt ceiling 
issue is a political and economic crisis 
of the Democrats’ own making. They 
have known for 2 years this day was 
coming. They never even bothered to 
draft a budget for the government, 
much less pass it, and never lifted a 
finger to start the bipartisan discus-
sions on how to raise the debt ceiling 
while addressing America’s exploding 
national debt. 
They have insisted on one-party rule 
all year, from an unnecessary, wasteful 
$2 trillion COVID stimulus that didn’t 
stimulate the economy or defeat the 
virus to a national takeover of State 
and local elections, bailouts of failing 
State and local governments, ignoring 
the humanitarian and security crisis at 
the southern border, and the disastrous 
surrender to the Taliban in Afghani-
stan. 
House Democrats have made it clear: 
We are running the place. Just sit 
down and shut up. 
The bottom line on the debt ceiling 
today: Democrats alone have set fire to 
America’s house and are now demand-
ing Republicans put it out for them. 
I urged Treasury Secretary Yellen, 
who I respect and who has bipartisan 
credibility, to do what the congres-
sional Democrats have not: engage 
with 
Republicans 
on 
a 
reasonable 
framework of financial stability for 
our Nation. 
There 
is 
precedent. 
Secretary 
Mnuchin certainly set that, reaching 
out repeatedly to Democrat leadership 
on these issues. 
Although it should be noted, given 
the strident blame game now by Speak-
er PELOSI on the debt ceiling, I remem-
ber February 2018 when she, Leader 
HOYER, Whip CLYBURN, and 116 other 
House Democrats voted to default on 
America’s debt, shut down the govern-
ment, and refuse disaster relief to dev-
astated communities across America. 
One of the Democrat leaders even 
said: ‘‘Republicans control the House, 
the Senate, and the White House. The 
responsibility to govern rests squarely 
on their shoulders.’’ 
Well, right now, the Democrats con-
trol the House, the Senate, and the 
White House. The responsibility to gov-
ern rests squarely on their shoulders. 
I agree that Congress should not play 
political games with the debt ceiling or

September 29, 2021 
ignore the danger of making perma-
nent the temporary COVID relief with 
spending that will bankrupt our Nation 
in the future. 
Democrats control everything—the 
House, the Senate, and the Presi-
dency—and they can easily pass the 
debt ceiling by including it in their $31⁄2 
trillion tax hikes and welfare state ex-
pansion, which requires no Republican 
votes. 
But rather than work together, what 
did Democrats do? As I noted, they 
rammed through a partisan, nearly $2 
trillion so-called stimulus bill. This 
was 
unaccountable, 
partisan 
Wash-
ington spending that only made mat-
ters worse, especially rising inflation 
for working families. 
For example, in that bill, Democrats 
undid a bipartisan agreement to pro-
tect taxpayers against the greatest 
theft of American tax dollars in our 
lifetime, which by now has lost up to 
$400 billion to fraud. 
They even opened the door to greater 
fraud by replacing the Republican child 
tax credit that rewarded work with the 
cash-for-kids welfare check program 
with few safeguards. 
Stopping fraud and taking care of tax 
dollars should be a bipartisan goal that 
would stretch the spending in the Fed-
eral Government. Instead, Democrats 
are demanding this tax and spending 
binge that will kill 3 million U.S. jobs, 
drive prices even higher, and impose 
the largest expansion to the welfare 
state in our lifetime. 
I urge my Democrat colleagues: End 
the brinkmanship. We can achieve a bi-
partisan framework. Just look at the 
Republicans’ repeated efforts. 
In 2016, the House passed a Ways and 
Means bill called the Debt Manage-
ment and Fiscal Responsibility Act, 
creating a system that would have al-
lowed Congress to make informed deci-
sions about the debt ceiling and con-
sider changes before it became a crisis. 
Yet, the Obama administration op-
posed the bill. 
Today, Democrats are hardly worried 
about new burdens as they put the IRS 
in charge of workers’ paid family and 
medical leave, or hire 80,000 new IRS 
agents, or impose IRS bank surveil-
lance on the personal and business ac-
counts of Main Street and working 
families. 
And Democrats won’t take up a simi-
lar bill, the Debt Solution and Ac-
countability Act, offered by Ways and 
Means 
Republican 
Representative 
LLOYD SMUCKER from Pennsylvania. 
Democrats’ alternatives these days 
to a bipartisan framework range from 
ridiculous to irresponsible. 
One Democrat Congressman has pro-
posed U.S. Treasury mint a trillion- 
dollar coin—a trillion-dollar coin. Why 
not a quadrillion-dollar coin? 
This farfetched idea sounds about as 
brilliant as many Democrats’ own calls 
to end the debt limit entirely, as the 
Speaker has sought. 
I think Democrats’ best answer to 
Washington’s out-of-control spending 
is to spend more and to tear out the 
brakes. 
Let’s be honest. This is an economic 
and political crisis of the Democrats’ 
own making. There isn’t enough money 
in America to cover what Democrats 
want to spend, and Americans know it. 
That is why President Biden has gone 
out of his way to sell his $3.5 trillion 
bill as not adding to the debt, saying 
the ‘‘Build Back Better agenda costs 
zero dollars,’’ a claim that ranks right 
up with: ‘‘If you like your healthcare 
plan, you can keep it.’’ 
Unfortunately for him and for the 
taxpayers that will have to foot the 
bill, The Washington Post fact-checker 
found this claim misleading. 
b 1430 
They said that it ‘‘would take dubi-
ous gimmicks that will help disguise 
the true cost of President Biden’s agen-
da.’’ 
Again, considering Democrats have 
not had a single conversation about 
spending, stimulus, or the debt with us 
to date, I think they, by their behav-
ior, have taken responsibility to pass 
this by themselves. 
It is irresponsible to keep raising the 
debt limit, keep on spending without 
any framework, or any discussion 
about this explosion of America’s debt. 
We need to grow the economy, con-
strain our spending, work together, 
both parties together, to get our finan-
cial house back in order for our chil-
dren and grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), Speaker of the 
House, for a firm rebuttal. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
thank him for his masterful leadership 
of the Committee on Ways and Means 
to address many of the health concerns 
and climate concerns, issues of fairness 
in our economy in such an important 
way that has been manifested in the 
rescue package and now in the Build 
Back Better legislation. 
Today, we come to the floor about a 
very important issue of concern on the 
economic stability and fiscal soundness 
of our country. 
Madam Speaker, as you recall, last 
week, House Democrats honored our 
responsibility to the American people 
by voting on lifting the debt ceiling 
and on a continuing resolution to keep 
government open to avoid a dev-
astating shutdown. Not one Republican 
voted to lift the debt ceiling or to keep 
government open, even though there 
were very important measures to ad-
dress the needs of people affected by 
Ida and to help us help the evacuees 
from Afghanistan, and other issues in 
there of concern to all Americans. 
We all know the full faith and credit 
of the United States should not be 
questioned. This is in the Constitution. 
In the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 
4, states: ‘‘The validity of the public 
debt of the United States, authorized 
by law, shall . . . not be questioned.’’ 
Madam Speaker, even by questioning 
it, our credit rating was brought down 
when the Republicans questioned it 
when President Obama was in office. 
Let’s 
just 
talk 
about 
the 
con-
sequences. Our distinguished chairman 
of the Committee on Ways and Means 
talked about what it meant in people’s 
personal lives. And that is really what 
we are here about, for people in their 
personal lives, their financial and 
health security. 
The consequences of not lifting the 
debt ceiling would be catastrophic. The 
nonpartisan Moody’s Analytics found 
these consequences could include a loss 
of 6 million jobs, the elimination of po-
tentially 
$15 
trillion 
of 
household 
wealth, sending the unemployment 
rate surging to 9 percent, and a decline 
in the real GDP of our country by 4 
percent. 
What that means in people’s personal 
lives, according to the Joint Economic 
Committee, default on not lifting the 
debt ceiling could prompt a lasting 
downgrade in America’s credit, dras-
tically increasing the cost for car 
loans—families have car loans—mort-
gages, student loans, credit card bills, 
and other borrowing. I don’t know if 
there is anyone in the country who 
doesn’t have such a loan, certainly 
among America’s working families. 
In a larger sense, JPMorgan Chase 
CEO Jamie Dimon predicted that such 
a default ‘‘could cause an immediate, 
literally cascading catastrophe of un-
believable proportions and damage to 
America for 100 years. Let me repeat 
that: ‘‘could cause an immediate, lit-
erally cascading catastrophe of unbe-
lievable proportions and damage to 
America for 100 years.’’ 
As I said before, it would be cata-
strophic. We must act now. 
Yesterday, 
Secretary 
Yellen 
an-
nounced that by October 18, the Treas-
ury is set to exhaust extraordinary 
measures and cash on hand, leading us 
barreling towards a default. This has 
been going on since the end of July 
when the debt limit expired. 
Addressing the debt limit is not 
about future spending. This is about 
meeting the obligations that the Amer-
ican government has already incurred, 
including when we worked together on 
the bipartisan COVID relief legislation 
last December. Only 3 percent of the 
current debt that we are lifting the 
debt ceiling to accommodate has been 
accrued under President Biden. 
A big chunk of this, though, is attrib-
uted to at least $2 trillion in the tax 
scam of 2017 where the Republicans 
gave 83 percent of the benefits to the 
top 1 percent. And now we have to lift 
the debt ceiling to pay for that. 
The debt limit has long been a bipar-
tisan issue, and you could talk about 
times when Democrats and Repub-
licans voted against it, in part. But it 
is very hard to find a time when they 
said my vote will take down the debt 
limit. Democrats have never done that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5528 
September 29, 2021 
Congress has addressed the debt limit 
78 times, as the distinguished chairman 
mentioned, since 1960; 29 times with a 
Democrat in the White House; 49 times 
under a Republican President. 
More recently, since 2011, each of the 
seven times that the debt limit was ad-
dressed, Congress did so on a bipartisan 
basis. This includes three times under 
the most recent former President when 
Democrats cooperated. 
We did so because the full faith and 
credit of the United States of America 
cannot be questioned—the Constitution 
says that—and because of all of the 
consequences that would happen if we 
did not lift the debt ceiling. Repub-
licans’ refusal to support a suspension 
of the debt limit now is cynical, hypo-
critical, and downright dangerous. 
As MITCH
MCCONNELL
himself has 
said about the need to address the debt 
limit, this is what he said last time: 
‘‘Don’t play Russian roulette with our 
economy.’’ Yet, that is exactly what he 
is doing: playing Russian roulette—in-
teresting that he is playing Russian 
roulette—with our economy and with 
the financial security and the well- 
being of America’s working families. 
The kitchen table concerns: How are 
they going to pay the bills? Well, now 
the interest rate will be higher if the 
Republicans prevail. 
That is why today, we will pass this 
suspension of the debt limit. Demo-
crats are for the people and will never 
let the full faith and credit of the 
United States be questioned because we 
take an oath to the Constitution of the 
United States—and that is an oath that 
we always intend to uphold—and be-
cause we have a responsibility to the 
health and well-being of America’s 
working families, and this would have 
a disastrous effect on them. 
Madam Speaker, I salute the distin-
guished chairman once again, and I 
urge—and hopefully—a strong bipar-
tisan vote on this legislation. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD this fact-check 
from The Washington Post about this 
claim we just heard, that 83 percent of 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went to the 
top 1 percent. They gave that false 
statement ‘‘3 Pinocchios,’’ calling it a 
‘‘zombie 
claim’’ 
and 
‘‘galling.’’ 
PolitiFact agreed, calling it ‘‘mis-
leading.’’ 
[From the Washington Post] 
THE PINOCCHIO SIX: MYTHS, LIES & DEBUNKED 
CLAIMS ABOUT TAXES 
1. False: Biden: ‘‘All of [GOP Tax Cuts] 
went to folks at the top and corporations 
that pay no taxes.’’ 
The Washington Post fact check gave this 
‘‘4 Pinocchios,’’ saying this is ‘‘simply 
wrong’’ and ‘‘clearly false.’’ 
Three of every four dollars in the 2017 tax 
cuts went to individuals, cutting taxes for 
the lowest-income Americans by 10% while 
cutting taxes for the top 1% by less than 
one-half of 1%. 
In the 2017 GOP tax reform, corporations 
effectively paid for 85% of their tax cuts 
thanks to eliminating special tax provisions 
and broadening the U.S. tax base. 
2. Myth: ‘‘The wealthy don’t pay their ‘fair 
share.’ ’’ 
America has long had one of the most pro-
gressive tax codes among developed nations, 
with higher-income people paying higher tax 
rates, say the Organization for Economic Co-
operation & Development (OECD). 
The top 1% pay 40% of all income taxes, 
and the top 10% pays 70% of all income 
taxes, according to the Tax Foundation. 
After the GOP Tax Cuts, the rich pay a 
larger, not smaller, share of income taxes. 
3. False: ‘‘83% of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
(TCJA) tax cuts went to top 1%.’’ 
The Washington Post gave this false state-
ment ‘‘3 Pinocchios,’’ calling it a ‘‘zombie 
claim’’ and ‘‘galling.’’ Politifact agreed, call-
ing it ‘‘misleading.’’ 
4. False: ‘‘Corporate tax receipts declined 
by 40% after GOP Tax Cuts.’’ 
Like government revenue that reached 
record levels in the two years after GOP tax 
reform, corporate tax receipts are higher and 
growing after TCJA, despite Democrats’ 
claims. 
Corporate tax revenues this year are $285 
billion, 22% higher than the Obama-Biden 
Admin’s last year. 
The Congressional Budget Office projects 
corporate tax revenues under TCJA will in-
crease to $379 billion in 2023—a record high. 
Biden’s own budget scorers project U.S. 
corporate tax revenues under TCJA will 
reach 1.63% of GDP by 2025, higher than the 
1.55% average in the decade before the GOP 
tax cuts. 
5 Myth: ‘‘55 profitable U.S. corporations 
paid no taxes last year.’’ 
This is an unverifiable claim by a far-left 
group (ITEP) using flawed methodology. It is 
not based on actual tax data—taxpayer data 
is private and most 2020 tax corporate re-
turns have yet to be filed. 
This group confuses the difference between 
taxable income and financial statement re-
ports. 
Similar reports that U.S. multinational 
corporations only pay very low tax rates on 
their earnings overseas are flawed either by 
double-counting, 
faulty 
methodology, 
or 
cherry-picked data. 
6. Myth: ‘‘The Death Tax only impacts two 
of every 1,000 taxpayers who die.’’ 
Relatively few estates pay the Death Tax, 
but many more file estate tax returns, and 
millions of farms and other family busi-
nesses are forced to waste precious time and 
money to avoid a mistake that will result in 
a confiscatory tax bill from the IRS. 
The Death Tax crushes investment in 
workers 
& 
expanded 
operations, 
harms 
growth & opportunity. 
The Death Tax ranks as a devastatingly in-
efficient tax since it raises a very small 
amount of revenue while placing a very large 
burden on farms and other family businesses. 
In fact, the Cato Institute says the Death 
Tax ‘‘is anti-saving and anti-investment,’’ 
encourages ‘‘wealthy folks to consume their 
wealth before death,’’ and does nothing for 
U.S. long-term growth. 
A growing number of women- and minor-
ity-owned businesses are finding themselves 
subject to the Death Tax as they try to build 
wealth for the first time and pass it on to the 
next generation. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. NUNES). 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY) 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today and op-
pose the Democrat’s latest socialist 
spending spree. 
Today, the Federal Government pre-
sides over nearly $30 trillion in debt 
and $100 trillion of unfunded liabilities 
in Medicare, Social Security, and Med-
icaid. 
These catastrophic debts are growing 
increasingly unsustainable. And now 
the Democrats are using the debt ceil-
ing as a blackmail to enable passage of 
an unaffordable so-called human infra-
structure bill. I still don’t quite under-
stand what that means, but maybe 
they will enlighten us during the de-
bate. 
The Democrats, themselves, can’t 
honestly tell us how much this bill 
would cost. First, they said it was $3.5 
trillion, then the amount was raised to 
over $4 trillion. And both figures, obvi-
ously, underestimate the true cost by 
trillions of dollars. 
Then with an amazing message dis-
cipline, Democrats in the House, Sen-
ate, and White House, along with their 
media cheerleaders, suddenly began 
claiming, in unison, that the bill won’t 
cost anything at all. 
They previously argued that ‘‘tax the 
rich’’ would pay for everything. But 
now, they have apparently conjured a 
true economic miracle: 
No one will have to pay for the astro-
nomical cost of this bill. It is Congress’ 
first self-financing, multi-trillion-dol-
lar spending plan. It is amazing that no 
Member of Congress ever figured this 
out before. 
Now that the Democrats are full of 
their new socialist colleagues, you 
have 
finally 
achieved 
the 
Marxist 
dream of abolishing money. 
The bill itself is the mother of all so-
cialist spending programs. It is as if 
the Democrats are rejecting all fiscal 
restraint and decided that they had one 
shot to turn America into a socialist 
welfare state. 
Madam Speaker, I reject that trans-
formation and the spending gimmicks 
needed to enact it. I urge all Members 
to vote against this scheme and vote 
down the increase in the debt limit. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON), a very capable 
member of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding and his great lead-
ership in regard to the issues that we 
are dealing with today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, our national debt 
rose $7.8 trillion under the last Presi-
dent, a Republican President. My Re-
publican colleagues voted for that 
spending; raising the debt ceiling is 
about paying those bills. But my Re-
publican colleagues who claim to be 
the party of fiscal responsibility don’t 
want to pay their bills. 
Well, the Republicans are risking 
economic Armageddon to score polit-
ical points against a Democratic Presi-
dent. If we don’t pass this bill, unem-
ployment 
numbers 
will 
skyrocket, 
markets will tumble, Social Security 
payments will be delayed, borrowing 
costs will go up, so that means for car

loans, for home loans, for farm loans— 
all of that, because of their irrespon-
sibility—will be out of reach for most 
Americans. It will be a catastrophe. 
Madam Speaker, it is time to stop 
playing games, political games, and 
raise the ceiling, as we have done many 
times before in a bipartisan way. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
West Virginia (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. 
MILLER 
of 
West 
Virginia. 
Madam Speaker, let us be clear. My 
colleagues across the aisle want to 
raise the debt ceiling to pay for their 
3.5 trillion tax and spending spree. 
In my home State of West Virginia 
and across the country, people are pay-
ing more for gas, groceries, and other 
everyday items because of the liberals’ 
reckless spending. 
Taxpayers are sick of footing the bill 
for the terrible policies which continue 
to make the problem of inflation even 
worse. 
Americans shouldn’t have to pay for 
the consequences of Democrats’ out-of- 
touch actions. Democrats are respon-
sible for the spending, and they need to 
take responsibility for the borrowing. 
This entire Congress, House Democrats 
have chosen to go it alone and push 
through liberal items without any Re-
publican input. 
The liberals have managed to spend 
trillions by themselves. They can raise 
the debt ceiling alone, too. Socialism 
has a price tag. It is time the Demo-
crats learn that lesson. 
b 1445 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER), whose work on in-
frastructure is a model for the Nation. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy 
and his leadership on this issue. I agree 
with his comments earlier. 
The notion that somehow this is a 
wild, Democratic, socialist spending 
spree and we need to raise the debt 
ceiling to deal with it is patently false. 
I just note that there was $5 trillion 
that was spent recently in the end of 
the Trump administration and recently 
here dealing with the COVID crisis. 
Much of that spending was passed on 
a bipartisan basis. It wasn’t wild so-
cialist spending. These are funds that 
the American people desperately need-
ed. 
The dismissive comment about cash 
for kids—give me a break. Being able 
to provide 69 million American chil-
dren with monthly payments has re-
sulted in lifting almost half of poor 
children out of poverty, and it is wildly 
popular by the American public. This is 
not reckless. This is reasonable. It is 
more necessary now than ever. 
I do hope we are able to move for-
ward with the broad outline of pro-
grams moving forward for infrastruc-
ture, the environment, and fighting the 
climate crisis. In the meantime, we 
must and we will meet our obligations 
to pay for money that the Congress has 
already spent. 
Now, I see my colleague BRENDAN 
BOYLE here who has an idea to stop the 
lunacy of the debt ceiling charade for a 
long-term solution. But unless and 
until we do that, we need to meet our 
obligations and be able to protect the 
full faith and credit of the United 
States, and I hope we do that in a more 
honest basis. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. SMITH), the ranking Repub-
lican of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I truly hope that my Demo-
crat colleagues don’t believe the gar-
bage that they have been spouting, but 
I would say that they probably do. Un-
fortunately, 
for 
months 
Democrats 
have been pursuing a radical partisan 
agenda that contains the most expen-
sive piece of legislation in the history 
of Congress, all while ignoring our Na-
tion’s debt. Now they are scrambling. 
First they claimed it was Repub-
licans’ responsibility to cosign a loan 
for their reckless spending bill, even 
though they control the White House, 
the House, and the Senate. Then they 
tried adding a debt ceiling increase to 
a bill to keep the government open, 
knowing it would fall on its face in the 
United States Senate. 
Then 
they 
argued 
there 
wasn’t 
enough time to raise the debt limit on 
their own, even though they have time 
and they have tools to do it. In fact, 
last weekend the House Budget Repub-
licans gave Democrats a chance to ad-
dress the debt limit by demanding 
their budget in a markup be revised. 
They refused. Then we offered to post-
pone the markup for just 48 hours to 
allow them to address the debt limit in 
reconciliation. 
Since you love to do everything else 
in reconciliation, why not to raise the 
people’s debt? You are spending it. It is 
time for you to get a loan for it. Folks, 
we are in a crisis right now. My coun-
terpart on the House Budget Com-
mittee made the statement: We should 
raise the debt a gazillion dollars. 
This is what we are dealing with, 
folks. The America people are fed up. 
They want fiscal accountability. We 
need a reasonable body in this House. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee, a cham-
pion of the underserved. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this legislation. 
This is legislation that protects the 
full faith and credit of our Nation; that 
protects the well-being of millions of 
our most vulnerable citizens, including 
seniors receiving Social Security, vet-
erans, 
servicemembers, 
small 
busi-
nesses, as well as physicians treating 
Medicare and Medicaid patients; and 
that protects our economic recovery 
and the global financial system. 
The refusal of Republican leadership 
to extend the debt limit threatens cat-
astrophic damage to America and 
Americans. Economists estimate that 
default could cost to United States’ 
economy up to 6 million jobs; wipe out 
as much as $15 trillion in household 
wealth; cause the unemployment to 
surge to 9 percent; and send global fi-
nancial markets into chaos. 
Republicans must work and be real 
with Democrats to address the debt 
limit 
to 
ensure 
that 
hardworking 
Americans, businesses, and commu-
nities across the country do not pay 
the price. 
Raising the debt limit is the only re-
sponsible thing to do. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Kan-
sas (Mr. ESTES). 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose this disastrous at-
tempt to suspend the debt ceiling. 
For the past 9 months, the Democrat- 
led House has made spending trillions 
of dollars on Big Government socialist 
and Green New Deal programs their 
priority. They have done this while ig-
noring so many critical needs of our 
country, which has led to a crisis at 
our southern border, runaway infla-
tion, rising crime, workforce shortages, 
and a disastrous retreat from Afghani-
stan. 
For the most part, my colleagues on 
the left have simply ignored these cri-
ses, while Republicans have introduced 
commonsense legislation and pushed 
the administration to answer for these 
very real and concerning issues. 
But today we are facing a crisis by 
their own creation that they cannot ig-
nore: suspending the debt ceiling when 
we already have $28 trillion in debt. 
Some of my colleagues have even sug-
gested that we should abandon the debt 
limit altogether, giving the Federal 
Government no safeguards to prevent 
ballooning debt and damaging the 
United States’ credit rating. 
Families, farmers, businesses, and 
even State and local governments have 
to live within their means and make 
responsible financial decisions to be 
successful, but the attitude in Wash-
ington continues to pass on massive 
debt to future generations in exchange 
for our current lifestyle. 
But we aren’t looking at this debt 
crisis in a vacuum. We could be voting 
on $5.5 trillion in more spending soon if 
Speaker PELOSI can pull together her 
caucus. 
Suspending the debt ceiling while 
also proposing trillions in new spend-
ing is reckless. Every American, adult 
and child, already bears the burden of 
about $85,000 each. Raising the debt 
ceiling is about future spending. An un-
limited debt ceiling until December of 
2022 would result in a massive increase 
in spending by the Democrats. 
The last debt ceiling increase covered 
all of the spending done during the 
Trump administration and for the first 
7 months of the Biden administration. 
We can’t just keep kicking the can 
down the road for future generations to 
figure out. We need to stop the reckless 
spending, taxing, and borrowing now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5530 
September 29, 2021 
That is the best way to protect the full 
faith and credit of the United States. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. HIGGINS), a very capable 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, the Republican Party is, in 
fact, the party of debt and deficit. Ron-
ald Reagan, a Republican, grew the def-
icit to $152 billion. Bush 1, a Repub-
lican, grew that deficit to $290 billion. 
President Clinton, a Democrat, wiped 
out the entirety of the deficit and gave 
$128 billion surplus to Bush 2, a Repub-
lican, who turned that $128 billion sur-
plus into a $1.4 trillion deficit. Obama, 
a Democrat, cut the Bush deficit of $1.4 
trillion to $600 billion, from which 
Trump, a Republican, grew that deficit 
to $1 trillion. 
Over the past 60 years, Democrats 
have created 21 million more jobs than 
Republicans. Annual economic growth 
is almost double. The Democratic 
Party continues the clean up the mess 
that the Republicans have made. And 
the Republicans are running away from 
the mess that they are responsible for. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. SMUCKER). 
Mr. 
SMUCKER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there are several problems with what I 
am hearing on the floor today. One, 
this is a blank check for Democrats to 
continue to spend at unprecedented 
levels. They talk about this spending 
for previous expenditures. Not true. 
This doesn’t even set a limit. This 
would suspend completely the debt 
limit until December 16, 2022. They can 
spend as much as they want. It is a big 
problem. 
Number two. Democrats aren’t talk-
ing about finding ways to reduce the 
debt. We must tackle that problem. 
Rather, they believe that they can 
spend their way into a prosperous econ-
omy. In fact, they are attempting to 
completely erode the foundation of our 
society that has been built on indi-
vidual freedom and personal responsi-
bility, and they want to pave the way 
for the radical socialist agenda. 
Unfortunately, we are already seeing 
the economic damage from their disas-
trous policies. Inflation is showing a 4 
percent increase year to date. Con-
sumer price inflation is higher than 
that. That is more than double the 
Federal Reserve’s 2 percent goal. Those 
increases are being felt in my district; 
they are being felt across the country; 
and they are essentially a hidden tax 
on the American people. 
Another problem we have, while they 
are attempting to spend even more 
money, cause even more economic 
harm, they will further degrade con-
fidence in the dollar. 
And, finally, another problem. This is 
an exercise in futility, and they know 
it. They know that this bill is very un-
likely to pass in the Senate. So this is 
simply to score cheap political points 
today. 
Democrats are in full control of the 
House, Senate, and the Presidency. 
They can raise the debt at any time. In 
fact, they passed up another oppor-
tunity to amend their budget resolu-
tion to include a debt ceiling increase, 
and they refused to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I am strongly op-
posed to the Democrats’ radical social-
ist agenda, and I oppose this bill which 
will help them advance that agenda. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. DELBENE), a member 
of the Ways and Means Committee, 
chief architect of the child credit ex-
pansion. 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today and ask this body to keep in 
mind four numbers: 6 million, 9, 15 tril-
lion, and 4. Moody’s predicts that if 
Congress fails to address the debt ceil-
ing, we will lose 6 million jobs, reach a 
9 percent unemployment rate, wipe out 
$15 trillion in household wealth, and 
see a decline in real GDP of 4 percent. 
That would trigger a global market 
panic not seen since the 2008 financial 
crisis. The brinkmanship that has been 
displayed by my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle is really incom-
prehensible, but also dangerous. 
The debt limit has long been a bipar-
tisan issue. Each of the last seven 
times the debt limit has been ad-
dressed, it was on a bipartisan basis. 
Putting politics ahead of the country is 
the exact kind of cynicism that makes 
American people sick. And as a former 
business leader, these are the games 
that keep our business community 
from being able to invest, to innovate, 
and grow. 
So I say to my colleagues, it is your 
duty to extend the debt ceiling and 
protect the American people from an 
economic crash. The Joint Economic 
Committee, which we all depend on for 
advice and guidance, predicts a default 
will result in a lasting downgrade of 
America’s credit, drastically increas-
ing costs for car loans, mortgages, stu-
dent loans, and credit. 
Six million jobs, a 9 percent unem-
ployment rate, $15 trillions in house-
hold wealth, and a decline in real GDP 
of 4 percent is what is at stake. We 
must vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
b 1500 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from west 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, it 
is not our duty to raise the debt limit; 
it is our duty to not spend so reck-
lessly and so egregiously and irrespon-
sibly that we bankrupt this country, 
and we rob our children of their free-
doms and the opportunities that we 
have all been blessed with as Ameri-
cans. That is our duty. 
I won’t give Republicans a pass on 
this, Madam Speaker. This place is bro-
ken. We play by a different set of 
rules—if 
we 
are 
honest—than 
the 
American people. The pay-fors just for 
the infrastructure bill are total jokes. 
It is a gimmick. It is Enron accounting 
scams. People in our country who oper-
ate that way would be thrown in pris-
on. So we are all accountable. 
But I have never seen this kind of 
spending spree to accelerate the curse 
that we are putting on the heads of our 
children. James Madison said: ‘‘ . . . a 
public debt is a public curse, and in a 
Republican 
Government 
a 
greater 
curse than any other.’’ 
Trillions of dollars have been spent. 
We were promised bipartisanship and 
restoration of unity in this place. We 
are jamming more bipartisan spending 
bills starting with COVID, which was a 
bailout of union pensions and which 
was a bailout of blue States and Demo-
crat-run cities. Very little went to 
COVID. That is deception. 
We are accelerating what Admiral 
Mullin said was the greatest threat to 
the United States. He said that the 
greatest threat to our national secu-
rity was our national debt. So we 
promised the cradle-to-grave cash, en-
titlements, and more handouts without 
any regard to responsibility and with-
out any requirement for work, and we 
are going to bankrupt the next genera-
tion. We are going to steal from them 
what we have enjoyed. 
This is not a profile in courage. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reconsider all of this spend-
ing that is bankrupting the country, 
and I urge them to vote ‘‘no’’ on the 
reconciliation bill. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. CHU), who is a very capable 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of doing what every 
adult is expected to do: pay their bills. 
That means raising the debt limit. 
Let’s be clear: this is not about new 
spending. This has nothing to do with 
any of our plans for new investments in 
infrastructure. Those plans are all paid 
for through other means. When we 
raise the debt ceiling, it is so we can 
pay the bills for money we have al-
ready spent. That means the reason we 
need to raise the debt ceiling right now 
is to pay Donald Trump’s bills—which, 
as usual, he would rather leave unpaid. 
Under the last administration, the 
deficit grew every year, totaling over 
$7 trillion in debt increases, requiring 
Congress to raise the debt ceiling three 
times. 
And why was that? 
Because the 2017 GOP tax scam used 
the reconciliation process to spend $2 
trillion on tax cuts for corporations 
and the wealthy that were not paid for. 
The American people were told that 
the tax cuts would pay for themselves, 
but that was a lie. And now the bill 
comes due. Again. 
But this time the Republicans are re-
fusing to even allow a vote. It is not 
that they are choosing to vote ‘‘no’’, 
which would be their prerogative, even 
if it is political and insincere. Instead, 
they are filibustering to prevent us

from even voting to stop the U.S. from 
defaulting; something they all said 
would be terrible. 
We are not children who flip a game 
over when we lose. It is our responsi-
bility to pay the government’s bills no 
matter who is in charge. 
Madam Speaker, if you can vote to 
give tax cuts to billionaire amateur as-
tronauts like Jeff Bezos and Elon 
Musk, then you can vote to pay the bill 
for it. It is that simple. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH), who is the ranking 
member 
of 
the 
tax 
policy 
sub-
committee. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to state for the 
record the prior remarks shared were 
inaccurate. 
The fact of the matter is, the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act actually resulted in 
more revenues to the Treasury. Let’s 
not forget that. And the fact of the 
matter is, a growing economy will do 
far more for the American people than 
new government programs that we 
can’t afford. 
We are standing here now, and of 
course, I think we should make good on 
our debts and make good on our obliga-
tions. This bill is not the solution. In-
stead of focusing on basics of gov-
erning, the majority has chosen to 
spend the past 10 months kind of argu-
ing here and there—a lot actually— 
first passing their $2 trillion inflation 
catalyst at the beginning of the year, 
and now arguing among themselves 
how to spend another $5 trillion. 
This bill is clearly not the solution. 
This 
bill 
isn’t 
bipartisan. 
It 
was 
brought to the floor solely by Demo-
crats and reflects their take-it-or- 
leave-it approach to governing. It does 
nothing to address our Nation’s spend-
ing problem. It is a blank check which 
allows the majority to spend as much 
as they want in the coming months un-
restrained by a true debt limit for the 
duration of this Congress. 
Democrats control government and 
can immediately raise the debt ceiling 
right now. There is a better way, how-
ever, than this particular bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Wis-
consin (Ms. MOORE), who is always the 
great 
champion 
of 
expanding 
the 
earned income tax credit. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to urge my col-
leagues to support raising the debt 
limit and to keep the main thing the 
main thing. 
I really don’t have time to address 
the Taliban, Afghanistan, the southern 
border, socialism, and all the rest of 
the stuff that has been raised. But I do 
have time to talk about blackmail that 
was raised here. This is the failure to 
join the Democrats in raising the debt 
ceiling to pay for one thing: the $2 tril-
lion that Republicans ran up providing 
tax cuts to the wealthiest corporations 
and individuals. 
The blackmail is that they want to 
force us to restore those cuts to the 
wealthiest people and to raise taxes on 
regular Americans by trying to upend 
our initiative to provide, for example, 
the child tax credit and to blackmail 
us into not providing those benefits. 
We have heard a great deal, Madam 
Speaker, about how this will hurt the 
markets and how this will create 
chaos, but who will really pay the 
price? 
It is everyday people and ordinary 
people, those Social Security recipi-
ents and veterans whose benefits will 
be delayed; people who won’t be able to 
get a car or a washer and dryer at a 
reasonable interest rate; and those 
thousands of people who will lose jobs. 
That is where the damage will come in. 
Madam Speaker, instead of paying 
these partisan games, I urge my col-
leagues across the aisle to act respon-
sibly. The full faith and credit of the 
United States should never be put in 
jeopardy. And by the way, people are 
not leverage. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE), who is always a 
champion of the industrial heartland. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and chairman for 
yielding time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of this legislation to protect the 
American economy, to save it from ca-
tastrophe, and to prevent a default on 
the obligations of the United States of 
America. The full faith and credit of 
the United States can’t be questioned. 
The full faith and credit of the United 
States should never be a partisan ques-
tion. 
We have passed action to address the 
debt limit 78 times—29 times with a 
Democrat in White House and 49 times 
with a Republican in the White House. 
In fact, when President Trump was in 
office, Democrats helped. We cooper-
ated, and we helped to address this 
issue three times. 
Yet now they are refusing to vote and 
refusing to support, meeting obliga-
tions that we already have. A robust 
debate about the future is fine, and we 
should have that, and we will have dis-
agreements. But we should never, ever, 
ever question, let anyone question the 
promises made by the United States 
Government. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE), who 
is a champion of very complicated 
issues relating to the debt ceiling. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I will attempt 
to address two things: the present and 
the future. 
First, on the present, there is no 
question, none—and let’s not let the 
other 
side 
get 
away 
with 
this 
conflating of two different things—this 
is not about adding new debt. It is 
about whether or not we are going to 
pay the bills for the old debt that was 
already rung up under all of the pre-
vious administrations combined, in-
cluding, and especially, the last one. 
That is what this is about. 
Are we going to pay our bills? 
Of course, the answer is yes. I have 
voted to raise the debt ceiling under a 
Democratic administration, and I have 
done it under a Republican administra-
tion because it is the responsible thing 
to do. 
But the second thing is the future. 
Why do we constantly keep finding 
ourselves in this rather bizarre, coun-
terproductive 
debate 
that 
achieves 
nothing? 
We always know the debt ceiling is 
ultimately going to be raised. 
The question is: How much of a polit-
ical game of chicken will we have to go 
through? 
And that game of chicken comes at a 
real cost. The last time the United 
States came close to not raising the 
debt ceiling was exactly 10 years ago. 
The GAO found the cost at $1.3 billion, 
and, my God, just imagine if ever a 
miscalculation brought about an occa-
sion in which by accident we truly 
didn’t raise the debt ceiling. 
When on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee I asked Secretary Mnuchin 
what would happen, he replied that the 
consequences would be so dire he 
couldn’t even imagine them. 
So let’s fix this. I have a piece of leg-
islation with Budget Committee Chair-
man YARMUTH that would take this out 
of 
the 
political 
sphere. 
It 
would 
depoliticize it. And instead, make this 
the responsibility of the Treasury Sec-
retary—Democratic 
Treasury 
Sec-
retary today, Republican Treasury Sec-
retary tomorrow. That would be the re-
sponsible approach and end this game 
once and for all. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. EVANS), who is a very ca-
pable gentleman. He is champion of all 
things Philadelphia, as well as quite 
knowledgeable about the debt ceiling. 
Mr. 
EVANS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
proudly rise in strong support of this 
bill. We have to pay our bills and up-
hold the full faith and credit of the 
United States. My constituents in 
Philadelphia don’t get a choice. They 
have to pay their bills. Congress must 
do the same. 
We are working together to finalize 
legislation to advance the Build Back 
Better agenda that we share with 
President Biden. As we do that, we 
must remember we are elected to gov-
ern. Let me repeat that. We are elected 
to govern. 
Yes, the Senate needs to act, but we 
also must be responsible in this House. 
We are responsible for protecting the 
recovering economy against the threat

of severe financial damage. This will 
clear the way to focus on bold opportu-
nities to support American families. 
Madam Speaker, I call on my col-
leagues to act responsibly and join me 
by voting ‘‘yes’’, ‘‘yes’’ to avoid the 
first-ever default in the Nation’s debt. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER), who is a member of 
the Ways and Means Committee and 
well-known for his midwestern values. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, 
today is my dad’s 88th birthday. As a 
CPA he taught me about financial re-
sponsibility. He taught me about pay-
ing our bills on time. I am sure he 
never could imagine our Congress 
would or could possibly put the full 
faith and credit of the United States at 
risk, but that is exactly the path my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
are advocating today. 
The stakes could not be higher. Sec-
retary Yellen has said that it would be 
catastrophic for the United States to 
default on its debt. There would be 
chaos in the financial markets, higher 
interest 
rates, 
slowed 
economic 
growth, an estimated 6 million lost 
jobs, and $15 trillion of people’s wealth 
disappeared. 
For the last 4 years the Republicans 
have run up our Nation’s debt. The bill 
is now due, and the Republicans want 
to tear up the statement and throw 
away the checkbook. 
b 1515 
Burying our heads in the sand won’t 
solve our problems, and it won’t keep 
our creditors at bay. It will, however, 
cause catastrophic damage to our Na-
tion’s credibility, damage to our Na-
tion’s economy, damage to our Na-
tion’s future, to our children’s future. 
I urge my colleagues to put the par-
tisanship aside, put the country first. 
Let’s vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill and make 
sure that our country pays its debts. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA) again, a very 
knowledgeable member of the Ways 
and Means Committee. 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge all of my colleagues 
in Congress to fulfill our obligation, 
not just to the people of our districts, 
but to the people and the economy of 
our Nation. 
Suspending and raising the debt limit 
simply lets our government pay our 
bills. It is a very simple responsibility 
that has been done 78 times since 1960, 
including 49 times under Republican 
administrations, 
and 
that 
includes 
three times during the Trump adminis-
tration. 
We raise the debt ceiling because we 
have to take into account the spending 
that we have already committed to, in-
cluding this time, where 97 percent of 
the spending was done during the 
Trump administration. 
If my colleagues are concerned with 
fiscal responsibility, they should know 
that breaching the debt ceiling will 
raise borrowing costs and add hundreds 
of billions of dollars to our debt. 
Failure to act on the debt ceiling will 
not just result in economic catas-
trophe. It will affect every American 
family, as borrowing costs and unem-
ployment will rise and markets will 
crash. 
Provoking such a financial crisis 
through such a sovereign default would 
be self-sabotage, and it is flirting with 
brazen irresponsibility. We are better 
than that. Let’s act responsibly, do our 
job, and raise the debt ceiling. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ), 
whose work on USMCA was out-
standing. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
because I have had enough of the 
games. I have had enough of the bad 
faith arguments and enough of the hy-
pocrisy when it comes to the debt limit 
from the other side of the aisle. 
Increasing or suspending the debt 
limit enables us to fulfill our existing 
financial obligations, and part of that 
includes the Republican Donald Trump 
tax cuts from 2017, the tax cuts that 
went to the top one-tenth of 1 percent 
and the largest corporations. 
That shows who they prioritized, by 
giving corporations permanent tax cuts 
while giving tax cuts to the middle 
class that expire in 2025 and were so 
small people didn’t even notice that 
they were given a tax cut in their pay-
checks. 
So, we are trying to fulfill the obliga-
tion of their tax cuts, and it does not 
authorize new spending. It doesn’t au-
thorize new spending. It doesn’t au-
thorize new spending. What it does is 
helps pay for that previous spending 
that has already occurred. 
I know my colleagues over here love 
to talk about the Pinocchios, but I 
want to say that they sit on a throne of 
lies, based on the arguments they have 
been making not only in the Ways and 
Means Committee but the ones they 
are trying to fool the American public 
with today. 
If we default, it ruins the credit-
worthiness of the United States. It 
causes our credit rating to be down-
graded, interest rates to increase, and 
will make things a lot more expensive. 
But for them, it is okay as long as they 
score their political points and put the 
blame at the feet of the Democrats. 
But that is not something that we 
should be playing with, and that is for 
both Republicans and Democrats. Do 
not play with the full faith and credit 
of the United States. It is irrespon-
sible, and it is beneath you to do that. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), 
the very capable Congresswoman. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. As a member of 
the Budget Committee, we sat for 
many hours on Saturday giving this 
Congress and the American people a 
budget. So I know that the discussions 
of my good friends are purely political, 
and the reason is this. In 2019, during 
the Trump administration, Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL, the very person 
who stood up with such great profound-
ness and did not want to vote to raise 
the debt ceiling in order to adhere to 
the Constitution, as the leader, he 
voted to raise the debt ceiling, and he 
said: ‘‘We will raise the debt ceiling be-
cause America can’t default. That 
would be a disaster.’’ 
Is there any poorer recollection? 
Then for those of us who are histo-
rians or love history, in 1789, Alexander 
Hamilton, the Nation’s first and great-
est Treasury Secretary, understood 
that the path to American prosperity 
and greatness lay in its creditworthi-
ness, which provided the affordable ac-
cess to capital needed to fund internal 
improvements and economic growth. 
That is why we are known as the great-
est economy in the world. 
I would venture to say to my col-
leagues that the importance of what we 
do stands on the premise of the Con-
stitution. We the people have formed to 
create a more perfect Union and for the 
general welfare of our people. 
Vote to increase the ability to pay 
our bills and stand worthy in the 
world’s eye. 
I want Leader MCCONNELL to remem-
ber his words. We need to do this on be-
half of the American people. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, I rise in support 
of the rule governing debate for RCP 117–16, 
S. 1301, the ‘‘Temporary Extension of Public 
Debt Act,’’ which provides funding to extend 
the national debt limit through December 16, 
2021 and avoids a wasteful, irresponsible, 
reckless threatening of one of the nation’s sin-
gular indispensable assets: the full faith and 
credit of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, American families do not 
get to choose which bills to pay and which 
ones to ignore; neither can the United States 
Congress without putting the nation into de-
fault for the first time in its history. 
Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the 
nation’s first and greatest Treasury Secretary, 
understood that the path to American pros-
perity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness 
which provided the affordable access to cap-
ital needed to fund internal improvements and 
economic growth. 
The nation’s creditworthiness was one of its 
most important national assets and according 
to Hamilton: ‘‘the proper funding of the present 
debt, will render it a national blessing.’’ 
But to maintain this blessing, or to ‘‘render 
public credit immortal,’’ Hamilton understood 
that it was necessary that: ‘‘the creation of 
debt should always be accompanied with the 
means of extinguishment.’’ 
In other words, to retain and enjoy the pros-
perity that flows from good credit, it is nec-
essary for a nation to pay its bills. 
Madam Speaker, if our friends across the 
aisle really want to shrink the deficit, reduce 
the national debt, practice fiscal responsibility, 
and bring about sustained economic growth 
and prosperity, there is a much better, easier, 
and more certain way to achieve these goals 
than by tampering with the U.S. Constitution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5533 
September 29, 2021 
The easier and better way is for the Amer-
ican people to keep a Democrat in the White 
House and place Democratic majorities in the 
House and Senate. 
In the 1990s under the leadership of Presi-
dent Clinton the budget was balanced for four 
consecutive years, the national debt was paid 
down, the national debt, 23 million new jobs 
were created, and projected surpluses ex-
ceeded $5 trillion. 
Under President Obama the financial crisis 
and economic meltdown inherited from his Re-
publican predecessor was ended, the annual 
deficit was reduced by 67 percent, the auto in-
dustry was saved from collapse, and 15 mil-
lion jobs were created. 
In contrast, under every Republican admin-
istration since President Reagan the size of 
the deficit bequeathed to his successor was 
substantially larger than the one he inherited, 
a major economic recession occurred, and 
economic growth was lower than it was at the 
beginning of his administration. 
According to Moody’s Chief Economist Mark 
Zandi, it would be ‘‘cataclysmic’’ for the United 
States to default. 
Republicans know the debt ceiling needs to 
be raised; in 2019 during the Trump Adminis-
tration, Majority Leader MCCONNELL and Sen-
ate Republicans voted to raise the debt ceil-
ing, ‘‘We raised the debt ceiling because 
America can’t default[,] that would be a dis-
aster.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this debate over extending 
the debt limit is not about restraining future 
spending, it is about paying the bills piled up 
already under both Republican and Demo-
cratic administrations. 
To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and 
credit of the United States, protect American 
jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure 
the continued growth of the economy, I strong-
ly support the provision in the bill before ex-
tending the public debt limit to December 16, 
2021. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for S. 1301, 
the ‘‘Temporary Extension of Public Debt Act.’’ 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself 30 seconds, and I can’t help but 
remember that, in February 2018, my 
colleague from Houston, Texas, voted 
to default on America’s debt, to shut 
down the government, and to withhold 
disaster funding for Hurricane Harvey 
in our region. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the majority leader, one of the most 
capable legislators I have known. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee for yielding. As you 
can tell, he is a good friend of mine, 
and he uses hyperbole in introducing 
me. I appreciate that. 
The ranking member of the Ways and 
Means Committee just made a com-
ment. I don’t think anybody has clean 
hands on this issue. I tell the ranking 
member, I don’t think anybody has 
clean hands. I don’t know the exact 
voting pattern of the ranking member. 
I think he probably has been on both 
sides of this issue himself. I think I 
have been. 
But I will tell the ranking member, if 
I am here when there is a Republican 
President—and I do not wish for that 
end, of course. But if I am here, I want 
to guarantee you that I will vote to lift 
the debt limit—guarantee you. 
I said 3 years ago, I would never vote 
against raising the debt limit and 
keeping America’s creditworthy status, 
never. In my view, it is intellectually 
dishonest to do so. 
This is a phony issue, and anybody 
who is intellectually honest with them-
selves knows it is a phony issue be-
cause it has no relationship to what 
the debt is. The debt relates to when 
we cut revenues or spend money, not 
some arbitrary limit that we theoreti-
cally put on our debt. We ought to be 
honest with the American public be-
cause too many people demagogue 
about this issue. 
Madam Speaker, on Monday, Senate 
Republicans voted against keeping the 
government open and paying the bills 
that our Nation has already incurred. 
That was not a reflection of responsible 
opposition in a democracy. 
We talk about the loyal opposition. 
The loyal opposition ought not to be 
loyal to the majority, but they ought 
to be loyal to the country. Instead, 
their vote is a reckless and irrational 
action that signaled very clearly to the 
American people, the financial mar-
kets, and the international community 
that Republicans would choose to pre-
cipitate an economic catastrophe for 
American businesses and families to 
score political points against President 
Biden and Democrats. That is what is 
happening here today. 
Three times over the past 4 years, 
House and Senate Republicans voted to 
suspend the debt limit when President 
Trump asked them to do so. I have no 
idea what President Trump is asking 
people to do at this point in time, but 
my experience is it is not the respon-
sible thing. 
Madam Speaker, when they asked 
Democrats for our help taking that 
needed step in order to prevent a cata-
strophic default, we joined with them 
to vote for it. 
When Speaker Boehner could only 
get 78 of his colleagues to vote with 
him to maintain fiscal responsibility in 
this country, only 78—I guess 77 be-
cause he was the 78th—would follow. 
And how did those bills carry? Because 
we, in the minority, joined with Speak-
er Boehner. 
When Speaker Ryan did the same 
thing, couldn’t get the majority of his 
own colleagues to back him, we gave 
the necessary votes to pursue and to 
ensure fiscal responsibility. Why? Be-
cause it was the right thing to do, be-
cause it was the necessary and respon-
sible thing to do. 
Treasury Secretary Yellen told us 
yesterday that we will run out of ex-
traordinary measures to forestall a de-
fault on October 18. That is fewer than 
20 days from today. 
Yet, we talk about partisanship, and 
we accuse others of not doing it one 
time or not doing it another time. This 
is the one time. This is our time. This 
is the time that the vote presents itself 
to us to keep America’s creditworthy 
status and to prohibit a national and 
international crisis. 
There is an urgency to our action, 
and we twiddle our partisan thumbs. 
Leader MCCONNELL, I am sure, has 
been quoted frequently. I haven’t heard 
all the debate, but frequently. ‘‘Let me 
make it perfectly clear. The country 
must never default. The debt ceiling 
will need to be raised.’’ That is his 
quote. 
Now, what he didn’t add was: But I 
am not going to help. But I am going 
to ask my party to be irresponsible. 
But I am going to ask my party not to 
do what I say should never happen and 
allow the country to default. 
I don’t know how you rationalize 
that. I don’t know how anybody with 
intellectual honesty rationalizes that, 
Madam Speaker, that you think we 
must never default, but by the way, I 
won’t vote for it. 
What does that mean? What kind of 
language is that? What kind of lack of 
principle is that? 
In order to give him and his fellow 
Republicans one last opportunity to 
prevent a default at a time when our 
recovery from the pandemic is not yet 
complete and still quite fragile, today, 
we are considering a clean debt limit 
suspension, not a number, just a date, 
which is, by the way, what both Repub-
licans and Democrats have used in the 
past. 
The bill before us simply says the 
United States of America will pay its 
bills on time. What a radical propo-
sition. 
Yet, our Republican friends cannot 
summon the intention to do just that. 
If Senate Republicans still cannot be 
consistent with their own votes from 
the past 4 years, they can stand aside 
and, as Leader MCCONNELL has sug-
gested, vote for cloture to allow Demo-
crats to pass the bill with 51 votes. At 
least do that. At least have the courage 
to allow others to display the courage 
of standing up and voting for what they 
know is absolutely essential and what 
they have said is absolutely essential. 
But if you believe that the full faith 
and credit of our country is worth safe-
guarding, 
that 
our 
businesses 
and 
working families deserve to be spared 
unnecessary economic pain, then vote 
‘‘yes’’ on both sides of the aisle. 
This is not a partisan vote. This is an 
American vote. This is for our country. 
This is for our fiscal responsibility. 
This is for fiscal stability. This is for 
families. 
b 1530 
Don’t twiddle your thumbs and say it 
is a partisan vote. It is not. 
A ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill is not a vic-
tory for Democrats or for the Presi-
dent. It is the responsible thing to do 
and a victory for our country. Al-
though we ought never to get to this 
place, we get to it all time, because we

September 29, 2021 
play these silly, partisan, pedantic, 
weak, meritless arguments. 
Everybody knows we have to do this. 
To sit there and say, ‘‘Well, I am not 
going to do it’’ is not fulfilling the oath 
to defend and protect this great Nation 
and this great democracy. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
What a bunch of nonsense that we 
just heard. I respect the majority lead-
er. I love his talk about courage and 
principle and language and all of that. 
But what he didn’t tell you was that 
in February of 2018, Speaker PELOSI, 
he, Whip CLYBURN, 119 House Demo-
crats, voted to shut down this govern-
ment, to default on America’s debt, 
and deny hurricane assistance to com-
munities not just in Texas, but across 
the country. He played politics with 
America’s debt. So did many Demo-
crats that day. 
While they lecture us about irrespon-
sibility, here is what we do know. This 
is a dangerous, irresponsible charade. 
Democrats are desperate to blame the 
GOP for this when, in fact, they cre-
ated this economic crisis. 
For 2 years, our Democrat colleagues 
have known this day was coming and 
never even passed a budget. They 
didn’t even try to pass a budget to deal 
with this. They never sat down with 
Republicans. They have rammed every-
thing through this House this year. 
Now, even though they have all of 
the votes they need, they are just play-
ing political games, willing to shut 
down this government, willing to deny 
disaster aid, willing to harm our econ-
omy and working families so they 
don’t have to raise this debt ceiling. 
The truth is, they don’t want to. 
They can. They don’t want to. They are 
manufacturing this crisis. They have 
all the votes they need. They are will-
ing to bring this economy to the brink. 
They have got all the votes they need. 
All they have to do is include it in rec-
onciliation. They just don’t want to. 
They just don’t want to. 
We could fact-check so much of what 
we heard today. We could spend the 
next 2 hours on this, and we could talk 
about all of the tax breaks for the bil-
lionaires and the wealthy in the new 
spending bill that is being brought to 
the floor. Trust me, this isn’t just 
about past debts. This is about a green 
light to spend America deeper and 
deeper and deeper into debt. 
To quote our Democrat leaders in 
2018: ‘‘Republicans control the House, 
the Senate, and the White House. The 
responsibility to govern rests squarely 
on their shoulders.’’ 
Democrats control the House, the 
Senate, and the White House. This re-
sponsibility rests on their shoulders. 
I will tell you, Madam Speaker, at 
the end of this debate, I intend to offer 
a motion to commit the bill to the 
Committee on Ways and Means and in-
clude a provision that would prohibit 
the IRS from implementing a bank sur-
veillance scheme. 
The reason I am doing this is because 
Democrats are leading a campaign to 
impose bank surveillance on your per-
sonal bank account and your business 
bank account. They are targeting fami-
lies and farmers and America’s small 
businesses. 
They want to give the IRS unfettered 
access to individual and business bank 
accounts. It is an outrageous intrusion 
into the private lives of all Americans. 
And they want to do that because they 
think they can raise money to lift the 
SALT cap, to give tax breaks to mil-
lionaires, to create tax havens for bil-
lionaires against the very tax hikes 
that they are proposing. Penthouse oc-
cupants are cheering. The building jan-
itor gets nothing. 
This is why they don’t want to take 
responsibility for lifting the debt ceil-
ing, because they have huge plans to 
really harm middle-class Americans 
while giving huge tax breaks to their 
friends. 
When Democrats want to sit down 
with Republicans and have a serious 
conversation about how we raise the 
debt ceiling, how we address the finan-
cial stability of this country, let me 
tell you, I am in, a lot of us are in. I 
am hopeful someday we can get to that 
because that is what our country de-
serves. I will oppose this debt ceiling. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the text of my 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, we keep hearing 
from our colleagues that somehow we 
are asking them to cosign a loan. I am 
prepared here to vote to lift the debt 
ceiling. That is the responsible posi-
tion. 
We have heard a lot today from the 
other side about why Democrats should 
shoulder the responsibility of acting 
responsibly in terms of governance, but 
that is not how governing simply 
works. 
We have been given great responsi-
bility and privilege to serve this great 
country, and that responsibility means 
making hard decisions and putting the 
good of the Nation ahead of all else, in-
cluding day-to-day politics. 
So in my hand, Madam Speaker, I 
have a $1 bill. For anybody in this 
Chamber or who is watching or who has 
ever had a chance to travel this great 
country of ours, you know that wher-
ever you go, you can redeem this dol-
lar. The purchasing power of this dollar 
is well known to all. 
But you know what is even more fas-
cinating about this? No matter where 
you travel in the world, to any nook or 
cranny of this globe, you put the dollar 
on the table and they figure out how to 
redeem it. This argument today is 
about the full faith and credit of the 
United States of America. This is 
signed by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury and the Treasurer of the United 
States of America. The basis of re-
demption is the trust that we might 
even have in strangers as it relates to 
the transaction of using this dollar to 
pay our bills. 
We have always come together to pay 
our bills. In 2017, when the debt ceiling 
was reached, 183 Democrats, every 
Democrat present, voted to lift that 
limit, joining 133 Republicans. 
Resist the ill-considered parts of the 
argument that have been offered today 
and vote for the responsible position to 
raise the debt ceiling based upon the 
full faith and credit of the dollar bill 
that we know is redeemed everywhere 
across the globe. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill, as 
amended. 
The question is on the third reading 
of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be read a 
third time, and was read the third 
time.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I have 
a motion to commit at the desk.

Clerk will report the motion to com-
mit.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in

the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
GUEST) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and to include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4611, the DHS Software 
Supply Chain Risk Management Act of 
2021. 
With 
each 
passing 
day, 
we 
see 
cyberattacks 
becoming 
increasingly 
more frequent and sophisticated, pos-
ing a significant threat to homeland 
security and the U.S. economy. 
The tactics cybercriminals use to 
steal information or disrupt access to 
critical information systems are ever 
evolving. Many prey upon vulnerabili-
ties within the victim’s security meas-
ures or the victim’s software supply 
chain. 
The ransomware attack on the Colo-
nial Pipeline and the attempted hack 
of a water treatment plan in Oldsmar, 
Florida, earlier this year, show just 
how easily critical infrastructure sys-
tems can be compromised. 
Last 
year’s 
compromise 
of 
the 
SolarWinds 
Orion 
software 
supply 
chain demonstrated how widespread 
and damaging such attacks can be. 
In 
the 
SolarWinds 
attack, 
cybercriminals were able to add mali-
cious code to a commercial software 
product 
that 
was 
subsequently 
downloaded by several Federal agen-
cies, 
including 
the 
Department 
of 
Homeland Security. 
As the lead Federal agency for cyber-
security, it is important that DHS lead 
by example, aggressively protecting its 
own networks. 
To that end, H.R. 4611 would enhance 
the Department’s ability to protect its 
networks by modernizing how it buys 
information and communications tech-
nology or services. 
H.R. 4611 directs DHS to issue De-
partment-wide guidance to improve 
visibility into the supply chain for 
software purchased from new and exist-
ing contractors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5536 
September 29, 2021 
Specifically, under this legislation, 
contractors would have to provide a 
bill of materials that identifies each 
part or component of the software sup-
plied to DHS and take steps to ensure 
that each item is free from known se-
curity vulnerabilities or defects. 
The bill of materials process is akin 
to the listing of ingredients on a pack-
age of food. 
Once DHS has this detailed supply 
chain information, it will have far 
greater visibility into what it is pur-
chasing and installing on its networks. 
b 1545 
With this information, DHS can take 
more timely action to mitigate risks 
associated with software on its net-
work. 
Importantly, H.R. 4611, which was in-
troduced by my colleague from New 
York (Mr. TORRES), requires DHS to in-
struct personnel on how to enforce the 
new requirements to hold contractors 
accountable. 
Finally, the bill requires the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to review 
the department-wide guidance and as-
sess how it aligns with President 
Biden’s recent executive order on im-
proving the Nation’s cybersecurity. 
As the President stated in this order, 
the Federal Government must take de-
cisive steps to modernize its approach 
to cybersecurity to keep pace with to-
day’s dynamic and increasingly sophis-
ticated cyber threat environment. 
I could not agree more. 
Enactment of H.R. 4611 would be a 
decisive step toward improving DHS’s 
ability to prevent, detect, and respond 
to cyberattacks on its own networks. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation and reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4611, the DHS Software 
Supply Chain Risk Management Act of 
2021. 
As we have seen over the past year, 
our software supply chains are increas-
ingly vulnerable. It is vital that the 
Department of Homeland Security does 
its part to ensure that software in use 
by the Department and its contractors 
is secure. 
This legislation will help DHS better 
understand and track the software and 
systems in use by its contractors so 
that it can better mitigate risk within 
the software supply chain. 
I urge Members to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 4611, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TORRES), the vice chair of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and the 
sponsor of the bill. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, a cyberattack on a software 
supply chain is like an infectious dis-
ease outbreak, spreading widely and 
rapidly, and causing untold damage far 
and wide. 
The SolarWinds espionage campaign 
against 
the 
United 
States, 
which 
spread surreptitiously through a soft-
ware product, represents the greatest 
intrusion into the Federal Government 
in the history of the United States. 
SolarWinds should serve as a wake- 
up call. The United States Government 
can no longer take for granted the safe-
ty of the software it uses. The Federal 
Government must be proactive in iden-
tifying and correcting cyber vulnera-
bilities; and as the lead agency on cy-
bersecurity, DHS in particular must 
emerge as the gold standard. 
I am therefore proud to partner, on a 
bipartisan basis, with my colleague, 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
GARBARINO), to pass H.R. 4611, the DHS 
Software Supply Chain Risk Manage-
ment Act of 2021. 
H.R. 4611 would require the DHS 
Under Secretary for Management to 
issue department-wide guidance that in 
turn requires DHS contractors to sub-
mit a software bill of materials, identi-
fying the origin of each component of 
software provided to DHS. 
DHS should know the precise origin 
of the software it uses; whether a soft-
ware component comes from a ques-
tionable firm that fails to follow best 
practices in cybersecurity; whether it 
comes from a hostile nation-state in-
tent on planting back doors. 
Homeland security can easily die in 
darkness, and the purpose of H.R. 4611 
is to bring greater light, greater trans-
parency to the software supply chains 
which for far too long have been left 
wide open to cyber espionage and sabo-
tage. We owe it to ourselves to learn 
from the experience of SolarWinds, for 
those who fail to learn from history are 
doomed to repeat it. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I urge Mem-
bers to support this bill. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time to close. 
As the lead Federal agency for cyber-
security, DHS has taken steps to in-
crease public awareness of software 
vulnerabilities routinely exploited by 
malicious cyber actors. 
To identify and manage these types 
of vulnerabilities on its own network, 
DHS needs better visibility into the 
supply chains of the software it pro-
cures. 
Enactment of H.R. 4611 would ensure 
that DHS has access to the information 
it needs to enhance its ability to man-
age the risks to its own networks. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
4611, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4611, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Mississippi 
(Mr. 
GUEST) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4089, the Darren Drake 
Act. 
This month the Nation observed the 
20th anniversary of the September 11th 
attacks. Next month we mark the 
fourth anniversary of the deadliest ter-
rorist attack to be carried out in New 
York City since the 9/11 attacks. 
In that attack, a lone wolf, inspired 
by ISIS, rammed a rented truck into 
pedestrians and cyclists who were out 
enjoying a sunny Halloween afternoon 
on a pathway that ran along the Hud-
son River. 
That attack took the lives of 8 people 
and injured 11 others. One of the vic-
tims of the attack was Darren Drake, a 
32-year-old bicyclist and the namesake 
for this important legislation. 
While it is not within our power to 
bring back Darren Drake or the seven 
other victims of this tragedy, we do 
have the ability to learn from this 
event to better address the threats of 
vehicle-based attacks. 
H.R. 4089, introduced by my colleague 
from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER), 
seeks to ensure that rental vehicle fa-
cilities, like the one where Darren 
Drake’s killer rented a truck, are bet-
ter equipped to prevent vehicle-based 
attacks. 
Specifically, the Darren Drake Act 
requires the Department of Homeland 
Security to develop best practices for 
vehicle rental companies and dealers to 
report suspicious behavior in a manner 
that protects civil rights and civil lib-
erties. 
The bill directs DHS to consult and 
share best practices with State and 
local partners and rental companies to 
help strengthen communication and re-
lationships to guard against vehicle- 
based attacks. 
H.R. 4089 is a commonsense measure 
that acknowledges that vehicle rental 
companies are important partners in 
efforts to prevent vehicle-based ter-
rorist attacks and provide them with 
the tools to identify suspicious behav-
ior and notify authorities. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Darren Drake Act and reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4089, the Darren Drake 
Act. 
In the wake of the Taliban takeover 
of Afghanistan, it is critical that we re-
main vigilant to threats posed by ter-
rorists and extremist organizations. 
Over the past two decades, terrorists 
have carried out multiple vehicle-ram-
ming attacks in North America and 
Western Europe. 
Al-Qaida and ISIS have promoted 
these type of attacks for years, includ-
ing in Inspire, the online magazine of 
al-Qaida, and Rumiya, ISIS’s magazine. 
ISIS has called upon its followers to 
conduct vehicle-ramming attacks by 
buying, renting, stealing, or borrowing 
trucks and targeting large outdoor 
events, 
crowded 
pedestrian 
streets, 
outdoor markets, and rallies. 
This legislation requires the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to develop 
and disseminate best practices for rent-
al companies and dealers to report sus-
picious behavior to law enforcement 
agencies at the point of sale of a cov-
ered rental vehicle to prevent and miti-
gate acts of terrorism using these 
motor vehicles. 
This represents an important tool for 
addressing extremist threats—the abil-
ity of government and the private sec-
tor to work together to mitigate ter-
rorism risk. 
I urge Members to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 4089, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER), the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4089, the 
Darren Drake Act, bipartisan legisla-
tion I introduced in the Committee on 
Homeland Security with my Repub-
lican colleague and co-chair of the 
Problem 
Solvers 
Caucus, 
the 
gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
FITZPATRICK), to help prevent terrorist 
vehicle attacks and to protect Ameri-
cans nationwide. 
This legislation is named in memory 
of a constituent from my district, 
Darren Drake from New Milford, New 
Jersey, who was one of those tragically 
killed in the terrorist attack in Lower 
Manhattan on October 31, 2017, when an 
ISIS-inspired terrorist drove a rented 
pickup truck into cyclists and runners 
for one mile along the West Side High-
way, killing eight. 
The bill takes critical steps to stop 
these weapons of terror and help pre-
vent terrorist truck attacks by requir-
ing the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity to develop and disseminate best 
practices for vehicle rental companies 
and dealers to report suspicious behav-
ior to law enforcement. 
These best practices will be devel-
oped and updated in consultation with 
State and local law enforcement as 
well as industry experts. 
This crucial legislation will provide 
rental companies and car dealers with 
the vital information they need to flag 
and stop potential terrorist threats in 
their tracks. We can take no chances 
when it comes to terrorism, which is 
why this bill will help ensure all rental 
companies report suspicious behavior 
at every point of sale. No excuses. We 
simply cannot afford any excuses when 
it comes to a question of life or death. 
The bill will also require the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security to report 
to Congress regarding the implementa-
tion of these best practices and other 
ways they are helping improve coordi-
nation between the Department and 
rental vehicle providers. 
This commonsense, bipartisan bill is 
aimed at stopping ISIS-inspired, lone 
wolf, and domestic terrorists from eas-
ily trucks and other vehicles to wreak 
havoc and cause mass destruction and 
health. It is an important addition to 
our arsenal as we work to eradicate 
threats of terror across our Nation. 
I want to thank Darren’s parents, 
Jimmy and Barbara Drake, who have 
become dear friends, for working with 
me on this effort. I thank them for 
their leadership. We will continue 
working to ensure this measure be-
comes law, in Darren’s memory and 
honor, to help prevent future attacks 
and save lives. It is the least we can do. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all 
my colleagues to support this common-
sense, bipartisan legislation to help our 
Nation fully combat terror wherever it 
rears its ugly head. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I urge Mem-
bers to support this bill. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time to close. 
Madam Speaker, from the 2016 Bas-
tille Day truck attack in France to the 
2017 deadly car ramming in Charlottes-
ville to the 2017 attack that took the 
lives of Darren Drake and seven others, 
we have seen the use of vehicles to 
carry out terrorist attacks become dis-
turbingly common. 
Our Nation faces a complex and 
evolving threat landscape. But the 
threat of vehicle-ramming attacks is 
not going away. 
As long as would-be terrorists seek to 
use rental vehicles as weapons of ter-
ror, we must provide rental dealers 
with the ability to do their part. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Darren Drake Act, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4089, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in the past few 
weeks, millions of students have re-
turned to school across the country. 
The range of public health, safety, and 
security risks that schools face today 
is truly astounding. 
In recent years, schools have increas-
ingly been subjected to ransomware at-
tacks where cybercriminals lock net-
works and demand ransom payments, 
sometimes while threatening to release 
sensitive information, including stu-
dents’ personal data. 
According to the K–12 Cybersecurity 
Resource Center, in 2020 alone, there 
were over 480 publicly disclosed cyber 
incidents at schools in the United 
States, an 18 percent increase over the 
previous year. 
Notably, the rate of such incidents 
increased in the second half of last 
year as COVID–19 forced schools to 
shift to virtual learning, creating new 
risks, such as the disruption of online 
classes and online school meetings. 
The impacts of ransomware attacks 
on schools have included the cancella-
tion of classes, the release of sensitive 
information, like the name of a 9-year- 
old student being evaluated for a dis-
ability, and costs as high as $7.7 mil-
lion for Baltimore County schools to 
respond to and recover from a Novem-
ber 2020 attack. 
With many schools still operating 
under virtual or hybrid conditions be-
cause of the ongoing COVID–19 pan-
demic, the vulnerabilities to such 
cyberattacks are even greater. 
In December, the FBI Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency, or 
CISA, and the Multi-State Information 
Sharing and Analysis Center released a 
joint cybersecurity advisory to alert 
schools to the increase in cyber threats 
and provide best practices on how to 
reduce the risk of such incidents. 
To further assist K–12 schools, we 
must do more to help schools guard 
against cyber threats. 
S. 1917, the K–12 Cybersecurity Act, 
introduced by Senator GARY PETERS 
from Michigan, requires CISA to con-
duct a study of the cybersecurity risks 
facing K–12 educational institutions 
and develop recommendations based on 
that study. 
By developing an online training tool 
kit for schools, and making the study 
and recommendations publicly avail-
able, CISA will be able to provide 
schools with targeted information to 
better protect their networks and re-
duce their cybersecurity risk. 
An identical version of this legisla-
tion was introduced in the House by 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
LANGEVIN) and cosponsored by Rep-
resentatives 
MATSUI, 
SLOTKIN, 
GARBARINO, and CLYDE. The House 
measure was reported favorably by the 
Homeland 
Security 
Committee 
by 
voice vote in July. 
Passing S. 1917 today would send this 
bill to the President for signature, al-
lowing CISA to begin this important 
work to better secure our schools. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of S. 1917, the 
K–12 Cybersecurity Act of 2021. 
Schools around our country are in-
creasingly the target of malicious 
cyber actors and have recently been 
targeted with a deluge of ransomware 
attacks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5539 
September 29, 2021 
This legislation introduced by Chair-
man PETERS and passed by the Senate 
mirrors the House version spearheaded 
by 
Representatives 
LANGEVIN, 
GARBARINO, and MATSUI. 
This bill requires CISA to conduct a 
study to develop recommendations and 
provide resources regarding specific cy-
bersecurity risks facing K–12 edu-
cational institutions. Importantly, it 
requires CISA to do so in consultation 
with teachers, schools, administrators, 
Federal agencies, nine Federal cyberse-
curity entities, and other private-sec-
tor organizations. 
In doing so, the study required by 
this bill would help the Federal Gov-
ernment better support schools in de-
fending against cyber threats. 
I urge Members to join me in sup-
porting S. 1917, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, while we are in the process of 
getting the sponsor of this legislation 
prepared to give his comments, let me 
say that we all have been involved in 
making sure that our schools are as 
safe as possible. Clearly, this legisla-
tion, as offered by Senator PETERS and 
Representative LANGEVIN and others, is 
integral to making sure that our 
schools are kept as safe as possible 
from cyberattacks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
LANGEVIN), the sponsor of the House 
version of this bill. 
Mr. 
LANGEVIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I commend the chairman for his strong 
leadership on cybersecurity issues and 
in support of this act before us today. 
This bill, the House companion of 
which I sponsored with Representatives 
MATSUI, KATKO, and GARBARINO, would 
help address a serious issue that has 
not received the attention it deserves: 
the cyber threats targeting our Na-
tion’s schools. 
The education of our children is 
clearly a critical function, yet the in-
creasing frequency and severity of 
cyber threats targeting K–12 schools 
have jeopardized the education of stu-
dents across America. 
In the past 4 years, more than 1,000 
educational organizations across the 
country 
have 
fallen 
victim 
to 
cybercriminals. More than 400 inci-
dents have occurred in the past year 
alone. What is more, an increasing pro-
portion 
of 
these 
incidents 
are 
ransomware attacks that are particu-
larly debilitating to the operation of 
our schools. 
Our students and educators have ex-
perienced more than enough disruption 
in the past year and a half. We cannot 
afford to let this issue continue to go 
unaddressed. 
Many of our schools do not have the 
resources to counter the cyber threats 
that we face. Without assistance, this 
problem will continue to get worse, 
jeopardizing our students’ privacy and 
ability to learn. 
Fortunately, this Congress has al-
ready demonstrated a recognition of 
the government’s need to provide cy-
bersecurity assistance to entities that 
perform essential functions yet live 
below the cybersecurity poverty line, 
unable to defend themselves against 
the myriad threats they face. 
It is why we took steps to invest $50 
million in support for State and local 
government entities as part of the 
forthcoming reconciliation bill. 
It is also why I fought to increase the 
budget of the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency by more 
than $400 million earlier this year. I 
thank Chairwoman ROYBAL-ALLARD for 
her leadership, and I thank her team 
and the members of the Appropriations 
Committee, 
along 
with 
Chairman 
THOMPSON and his team and the mem-
bers of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee. 
It should also be the reason that we 
pass the K–12 Cybersecurity Act into 
law without delay. 
This bill would direct the Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agen-
cy to study the cybersecurity risks fac-
ing our elementary schools and sec-
ondary schools. 
With a detailed understanding of the 
specific cybersecurity challenges fac-
ing our schools, including challenges 
raised by remote learning, CISA would 
then be required to develop cybersecu-
rity 
recommendations 
and 
online 
training tools for educational officials 
at K–12 institutions. Our educators and 
administrators would be equipped with 
the knowledge they need to better de-
fend themselves against cyber threats 
and keep our schools safe for our stu-
dents. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
MATSUI for her tireless attention to 
this 
issue 
and 
Representatives 
GARBARINO, SLOTKIN, and CLYDE
for 
joining us in advancing this legisla-
tion. I recognize the efforts of my col-
leagues in the Senate, Senator PETERS 
and Senator SCOTT, who deftly shep-
herded this bill through their Chamber. 
Finally, I recognize my good friend, 
Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON, for ensur-
ing this bill received the consideration 
it deserves. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
Members to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
With 
sophisticated 
cybercriminals 
operating 
overseas 
launching 
ransomware attacks on our schools, it 
is essential that the Federal Govern-
ment step up efforts to support the cy-
bersecurity of our schools. 
Without more assistance, many of 
our Nation’s school districts will con-
tinue to be vulnerable, as many lack 
the cyber expertise to defend against 
these incidents. 
Enactment of the K–12 Cybersecurity 
Act would enhance the technical sup-
port provided by CISA to schools to 
help better protect school IT networks. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 1917, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, S. 1917. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
HOMELAND SECURITY FOR 
CHILDREN ACT 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 4426) to amend 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to 
ensure that the needs of children are 
considered in homeland security plan-
ning, and for other purposes, as amend-
ed.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, during disasters, chil-
dren are uniquely vulnerable to phys-
ical and emotional harm. Sixteen years 
ago, Hurricane Katrina opened our eyes 
to the disproportionate consequences 
of disasters on our Nation’s children. It 
uprooted 300,000 children, forcing them 
to enroll in new schools, and separated 
5,000 children from their families, some 
for months. 
Drawing on the lessons from Katrina, 
the National Commission on Children 
and 
Disasters 
in 
2010 
issued 
rec-
ommendations to better protect chil-
dren during catastrophes. To date, 
fewer than a quarter of those rec-
ommendations have been implemented. 
Children today face a diverse range of 
homeland security challenges that im-
pact their lives. We have seen COVID– 
19, school shootings, hurricanes, and 
wildfires disrupt access to education 
and have far-reaching impacts on the 
lives of children. 
According to a study published this 
week, children today will experience 
three times as many climate-related 
disasters as their grandparents. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a Washington Post article on the con-
sequences of climate change for chil-
dren. 
[From The Washington Post] 
TODAY’S
KIDS
WILL
LIVE
THROUGH
THREE 
TIMES
AS
MANY
CLIMATE
DISASTERS
AS 
THEIR GRANDPARENTS, STUDY SAYS 
(By Sarah Kaplan, September 27, 2021) 
Adriana Bottino-Poage is 6 years old, with 
cherub cheeks and curls that bounce when 
she laughs. She likes soccer, art and visiting 
the library. She dreams of being a scientist 
and inventing a robot that can pull pollution 
out of the air. She wants to become the kind 
of grownup who can help the world. 
Yet human actions have made the world a 
far more dangerous place for Adriana to 
grow up, according to a first-of-its-kind 
study of the impacts of climate change 
across generations. 
If the planet continues to warm on its cur-
rent trajectory, the average 6-year-old will 
live through roughly three times as many 
climate disasters as their grandparents, the 
study finds. They will see twice as many 
wildfires, 1.7 times as many tropical cy-
clones, 3.4 times more river floods, 2.5 times 
more crop failures and 2.3 times as many 
droughts as someone born in 1960. 
These findings, published this week in the 
journal Science, are the result of a massive 
effort to quantify what lead author Wim 
Thiery calls the ‘‘intergenerational inequal-
ity’’ of climate change. 
Drawing on multiple climate and demo-
graphic models, Thiery and 36 colleagues 
compared the risks faced by previous genera-
tions to the number of extreme events to-
day’s children will witness in their lifetimes. 
Unless world leaders agree on more ambi-
tious policies when they meet for the United 
Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scot-
land, this fall, the study says, today’s chil-
dren will be exposed to an average of five 
times more disasters than if they lived 150 
years ago. 
The changes are especially dramatic in de-
veloping nations; infants in sub-Saharan Af-
rica are projected to live through 50 to 54 
times as many heat waves as someone born 
in the preindustrial era. 
The disparities underscore how the worst 
effects of climate change will be experienced 
in places that contributed least to warming, 
by people who have had little say in the poli-
cies that allow continued emissions to occur, 
Thiery said. More than half of all greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere were generated after 
1990, meaning that most of the disasters to-
day’s children will experience can be linked 
to emissions produced during their parents’ 
lifetimes. 
‘‘Young people are being hit by climate cri-
sis but are not in position to make deci-
sions,’’ he said. ‘‘While the people who can 
make the change happen will not face the 
consequences.’’ 
Aggressive efforts to curb fossil fuel use 
and other planet-warming activities can still 
dramatically improve the outlook for to-
day’s children, he added. If people manage to 
limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 de-
grees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, 
newborns’ risk of extreme heat exposure will 
fall almost by half. They could see 11 percent 
fewer crop failures, 27 percent fewer droughts 
and almost a third as many river floods than 
if emissions continue unabated. 
But the world is nowhere near meeting 
that 1.5 degree target. A U.N. report pub-
lished earlier this month warned that, based 
on countries’ current climate pledges, green-
house gas emissions could actually increase 
by 16 percent by the end of the decade. That 
would put the planet on track to warm by 2.7 
degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) by 
the end of the century. 
This 
makes 
Adriana 
angry. 
The 
Woodbridge, Va., first-grader already worries 
about the wildfires in California, where her 
half brother lives. She has heard about is-
lands being inundated by rising seas, caught 
glimpses of hurricanes and droughts on the 
news. 
Meanwhile, adults ‘‘don’t listen, and they 
keep doing it and keep making the Earth 
hotter’’ she added. ‘‘Everything will keep 
getting worse and worse until I grow up. 
Somebody has to do something.’’ 
The Science paper was partly inspired by 
Thiery’s three sons, who are 7, 5 and 2. But 
its implications are not restricted to chil-
dren. Anyone under 40, he said, is destined to 
live a life of unprecedented disaster expo-
sure, experiencing rates of extreme events 
that would have just a 1 in 10,000 chance of 
happening in a preindustrial world. 
‘‘It used to be a story of, like, ‘yeah we 
have to limit global warming because of 
grandchildren,’ ‘‘ he said. ‘‘This study is 
making clear that climate change has ar-
rived. It’s everywhere.’’ 
The numbers provided in the study are al-
most certainly an underestimate, said co-au-
thor Joeri Rogelj, director of the Grantham 
Institute for Climate Change and the Envi-
ronment at Imperial College London. Data 
limitations, and the complexity of the anal-
ysis, meant the scientists didn’t assess the 
increased risk of some hazards, such as 
coastal flooding from sea level rise. The 
study also doesn’t take into account the in-
creased severity of many events; it only 
looks at frequency. 
On the other hand, he noted, countries also 
have a chance to adapt to the changes that 
are coming. If the world invests in making 
communities safer—for example, installing 
flood barriers, adopting fire-safe building 
codes, providing shelter for people at risk 
from deadly heat—disasters don’t have to be 
as destructive for future generations as they 
are for people today. 
‘‘Our aim is for this not to be the conclu-
sion of this debate,’’ Rogelj said, ‘‘but for 
this to be the start of looking at the lived 
experience of children being born today.’’ 
Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at the Geor-
gia Institute of Technology who was not in-
volved in the new research, called it a ‘‘ro-
bust study’’ based on established findings 
from the United Nations Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change. As a scientist, 
Cobb said, she was unsurprised by the re-
sults. 
But Cobb is also a mother to four children. 
Reading the report through that lens, she 
said, ‘‘it brings into sharp focus what so 
many economic models of climate change 
impacts fail to capture—the vast toll of 
human suffering that is hanging in the bal-
ance with our emissions choices this dec-
ade.’’ 
She added: ‘‘The moral weight of this mo-
ment is almost unbearable.’’ 
In a report published in conjunction with 
Thiery’s findings, Save the Children Inter-
national called on world leaders to make the 
changes necessary to meet the 1.5 degree Cel-
sius target. Wealthy nations must also fol-
low through on their unmet pledge to give 
$100 billion per year to help low-income 
countries curb their own emissions and 
adapt to changes that are already underway, 
the group said. 
Yolande Wright, who directs the non-
profit’s climate efforts, also hopes the find-
ings will bolster legal efforts to force cli-
mate action on behalf of children. Last year, 
a federal appeals court threw out a case 
brought by 21 American young people who 
argued that the government’s failure to act 
on climate change was a violation of their

rights. Similar cases have been filed in Por-
tugal, Peru and elsewhere. 
‘‘Now that we can really quantify how a 
child in their lifetime will see so many more 
of these extreme events . . . it helps make 
the case,’’ Wright said. 
Environmental attorney Dan Galpern, gen-
eral counsel and director of Climate Protec-
tion and Restoration Initiative, agreed that 
‘‘anticipatory research’’ like this can help 
establish governments’ and corporations’ li-
ability for real harms experienced by kids. 
Young people already say climate change 
has touched their lives and harmed their 
mental health. In a recent survey of 16- to 25- 
year-olds, scientists found that three quar-
ters of respondents feared the future and 
more than half believed they would have less 
opportunity than their parents. Nearly 60 
percent said their governments had betrayed 
them and future generations—making them 
feel even more anxious. 
‘‘The future for me and everyone who 
comes after is so insecure,’’ said Emanuel 
Smari Nielsen, a 14-year-old climate activist 
from Norway. ‘‘When politicians and those 
with power do not do anything, it makes me 
feel tired. It almost makes me angry.’’ 
Adriana, the 6-year-old, said she feels 
‘‘super nervous’’ when she thinks about what 
the future might hold. In those moments, 
there’s nothing that helps her feel better. 
‘‘I just wait till I’m done thinking about 
it,’’ she said. 
Experts say one way to help children cope 
with climate anxiety is to help them feel em-
powered to do something about it. The Save 
the Children report calls for communities, 
countries and global institutions like the 
U.N. to give young people a greater role in 
setting climate policy. 
Cormac Buck, an 8-year-old from Savan-
nah, Ga., has decided to stop eating meat 
(except for the occasional chicken nugget). 
He is part of a group of kids at his school 
who have asked teachers and administrators 
to use fewer fossil fuels. 
‘‘Sometimes I hear some depressing things 
happening, like some animals because of cli-
mate change are really close to extinction 
. . . and I feel sad,’’ he said. ‘‘And then I nor-
mally try to think of a way to stop that from 
happening again.’’ 
And adults must earn back children’s 
trust, Thiery said, by making the dramatic 
emissions reductions that have been so long 
delayed. Our choices now will determine 
whether kids grow up in a world with four 
times as many heat waves or seven times as 
many heat waves, a world with occasional 
crop failures or chronic food shortages. 
‘‘We 
can 
still 
avoid 
the 
worst 
con-
sequences,’’ he said. ‘‘That is what gives me 
strength as a father . . . Their future is in 
our hands.’’ 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, the safety of our children is 
central to our country’s well-being, 
and we must ensure that, for its part, 
the Department of Homeland Security 
is equipped to consider these needs. 
The Homeland Security for Children 
Act would ensure the unique needs of 
children 
are 
taken 
into 
account 
throughout the Department by man-
dating the DHS Secretary direct all 
components and offices to consider 
children when creating policies and im-
plementing programs. 
b 1615 
It specifically directs the Depart-
ment to seek feedback from organiza-
tions that represent children when de-
veloping and carrying out policies and 
programs. 
H.R. 4426 would also permanently au-
thorize a ‘‘children’s technical expert’’ 
within the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency to prioritize the interests 
of children in emergency preparedness, 
response, and recovery initiatives. 
Lastly, the legislation, as introduced 
by my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. 
PAYNE) would require DHS to report to 
Congress on the Department’s work to 
incorporate 
children’s 
interests 
throughout all its work. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 4426, the 
Homeland Security for Children Act, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.

House of Representatives. Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: I write con-
cerning H.R. 4426, the Homeland Security for 
Children Act. There are certain provisions in 
this legislation that fall within the Rule X 
jurisdiction of the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure. 
In order to expedite floor consideration of 
H.R. 4426, the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure agrees to forgo action on 
the bill. However, this is conditional on our 
mutual understanding that forgoing consid-
eration of the bill would not prejudice the 
Committee with respect to the appointment 
of conferees or to any future jurisdictional 
claim over the subject matters contained in 
the bill or similar legislation that fall within 
the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. I also 
request that you urge the Speaker to name 
members of this Committee to any con-
ference committee which is named to con-
sider such provisions. 
Please place a copy of this letter and your 
response acknowledging our jurisdictional 
interest into the committee report on H.R. 
4426 and into the Congressional Record dur-
ing consideration of the measure on the 
House floor. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY, 
Washington, DC, September 23, 2021. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 4426, the ‘‘Home-
land Security for Children Act.’’ I recognize 
that the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure has a jurisdictional interest 
in H.R. 4426, and I appreciate your effort to 
allow this bill to be considered on the House 
floor. 
I concur with you that forgoing action on 
the bill does not in any way prejudice the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure with respect to its jurisdictional 
prerogatives on this bill or similar legisla-
tion in the future, and I would support your 
effort to seek appointment of an appropriate 
number of conferees to any House—Senate 
conference involving this legislation. 
I will include our letters on H.R. 4426 in the 
Congressional RECORD during floor consider-
ation of this bill. I look forward to working 
with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this Nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, 
Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4426, the Homeland Security for 
Children Act. 
While terrorist attacks, natural dis-
asters, and other large-scale emer-
gencies have devastating effects on our 
communities that last for years, the 
impacts on children whose lives are 
often shaped by such emergencies can 
be felt throughout our country for dec-
ades. This legislation will help ensure 
that DHS, especially FEMA, is consid-
ering those long-term implications in 
all aspects of its mission and planning. 
I commend Representative PAYNE for 
his tireless effort over the years to sup-
port and protect our Nation’s children. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 4426. I have no 
more speakers, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s children 
need our help. Natural disasters have 
impacted one in three Americans. 
Since the onset of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, over 5.5 million children have 
tested positive, and conditions are not 
trending in the right direction. 
According to the American Academy 
of Pediatrics, last week, with kids back 
at school, the number of infected chil-
dren had exponentially risen to the 
third highest level since the beginning 
of the pandemic. 
As a partner to schools, which are 
critical to infrastructure, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security has a crit-
ical mission to play in helping to pro-
tect children. To do so effectively, it is 
critical that children’s unique needs 
are front and center in DHS programs 
and policies. Enactment of the Home-
land Security for Children Act will do 
just that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4426, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4426, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
ONE-STOP PILOT PROGRAM ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 4094) to conduct 
a pilot program at foreign last point of 
departure 
airports 
to 
permit 
pas-
sengers and their accessible property 
to continue on additional flights or 
flight segments originating in the 
United States without additional secu-
rity re-screening, and for other pur-
poses, as amended.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5542 
September 29, 2021 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4094 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘One-Stop Pilot 
Program Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM FOR ONE-STOP SECU-
RITY. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding 44901(a) of 
title 49, United States Code, the Administrator 
of the Transportation Security Administration, 
in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, is authorized to conduct a pilot pro-
gram at not more than six foreign last point of 
departure airports to permit passengers and 
their accessible property arriving on direct 
flights or flight segments originating at such 
participating foreign airports to continue on ad-
ditional flights or flight segments originating in 
the United States without additional security 
re-screening if— 
(1) the initial screening was conducted in ac-
cordance with an aviation security screening 
agreement described in subsection (d); 
(2) passengers arriving from participating for-
eign airports are unable to access their checked 
baggage until the arrival at their final destina-
tion; and 
(3) upon arrival in the United States, pas-
sengers arriving from participating foreign air-
ports do not come into contact with other arriv-
ing international passengers or those pas-
sengers’ property or other persons who have not 
been screened or subjected to other appropriate 
security controls required for entry into the air-
port’s sterile area. 
(b) REQUIREMENTS FOR PILOT PROGRAM.—In 
carrying out this section, the Administrator 
shall ensure there is no reduction in the level of 
security or specific aviation security standards 
or requirements for screening passengers and 
their property prior to boarding an inter-
national flight bound for the United States, in-
cluding specific aviation security standards and 
requirements regarding the following: 
(1) High risk passengers and their property. 
(2) Weapons, explosives, and incendiaries. 
(3) Screening passengers and property trans-
ferring at a foreign last point of departure air-
port from another airport and bound for the 
United States, and addressing any co-mingling 
of such passengers and property with pas-
sengers and property screened under the pilot 
program described in subsection (a). 
(4) Insider risk at foreign last point of depar-
ture airports. 
(c) RE-SCREENING
OF CHECKED BAGGAGE.— 
The Administrator may determine whether 
checked baggage arriving from participating for-
eign airports referenced in subsection (a) must 
be re-screened in the United States by an explo-
sives detection system before such baggage con-
tinues on any additional flight or flight seg-
ment. 
(d) AVIATION SECURITY SCREENING AGREEMENT 
DESCRIBED.—An aviation security screening 
agreement described in this subsection is an 
agreement signed by the Administrator, without 
delegating such authority, and entered into 
with a foreign country that delineates and im-
plements security standards and protocols uti-
lized at a foreign last point of departure airport 
that are determined by the Administrator to be 
comparable to those of the United States and 
therefore sufficiently effective to enable pas-
sengers and their accessible property to deplane 
into sterile areas of airports in the United States 
without the need for re-screening. 
(e) RE-SCREENING REQUIREMENT.—If the Ad-
ministrator determines that the foreign country 
participating in the aviation security screening 
agreement has not maintained and implemented 
security standards and protocols comparable to 
those of the United States at foreign last point 
of departure airports at which a pilot program 
has been established in accordance with this 
section, the Administrator shall ensure that pas-
sengers and their property arriving from such 
airports are re-screened in the United States be-
fore such passengers and their property are per-
mitted into sterile areas of airports in the United 
States. In the case of continued or egregious 
failure to maintain such security standards and 
protocols, the Administrator shall suspend or 
terminate the aviation security screening agree-
ment, as determined appropriate by the Admin-
istrator, and shall notify the appropriate con-
gressional committees of such suspension or ter-
mination, as the case may be, not later than 
seven days after such suspension or termi-
nation. 
(f) CERTIFICATIONS
AND BRIEFINGS
TO CON-
GRESS.—Not later than 30 days before an avia-
tion security screening agreement in accordance 
with subsection (d) enters into force, the Admin-
istrator shall provide to the appropriate con-
gressional committees the following: 
(1) A copy of such agreement. 
(2) A homeland security threat assessment for 
the country in which such foreign last point of 
departure airport is located, information on any 
corresponding mitigation efforts to address any 
security issues identified in such threat assess-
ment, and the Administrator’s plans for ensur-
ing through joint covert testing or other meas-
ures compliance with the security standards and 
protocols set forth in such agreement. 
(3) A certification that such agreement satis-
fies all requirements specified in subsection (b) 
or, in the event that one or more of such re-
quirements is not so satisfied, an identification 
of the unsatisfied requirement and information 
on what actions will be taken to ensure such re-
maining requirement is satisfied before such 
agreement enters into force. 
(4) A certification that the Administrator con-
sulted with stakeholders, including air carriers, 
airport operators, relevant interagency partners, 
and other stakeholders the Administrator deter-
mines appropriate. 
(5) A detailed briefing on the substance of 
paragraphs (1) through (4). 
(g) SUNSET.—The pilot program described in 
subsection (a) shall terminate six years after the 
date of enactment of this section. 
(h) REPORT TO CONGRESS.—Not later than five 
years after the date of enactment of this section, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordi-
nation with the Administrator, shall submit to 
the appropriate congressional committees a re-
port regarding the implementation of the pilot 
program described in subsection (a), including 
information relating to the following: 
(1) The impact to homeland security and 
international aviation security, including any 
benefits and challenges, of such pilot program. 
(2) The impact to passengers, airports, and air 
carriers, including any benefits and challenges, 
of such pilot program. 
(3) The impact and feasibility of continuing 
such pilot program or expanding into a more 
permanent program, including any benefits and 
challenges. 
(i) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this 
section may be construed as limiting the author-
ity of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to in-
spect persons and baggage arriving in the 
United States in accordance with applicable 
law. 
(j) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) ADMINISTRATION; TSA.—The terms ‘‘Admin-
istration’’ and ‘‘TSA’’ mean the Transportation 
Security Administration. 
(2) 
ADMINISTRATOR.—The 
term 
‘‘Adminis-
trator’’ means the Administrator of the Trans-
portation Security Administration. 
(3) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘‘appropriate congressional 
committees’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Homeland Security of 
the House of Representatives; and 
(B) the Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs and the Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the 
Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
GUEST) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Mississippi. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4094, the One-Stop Pilot Pro-
gram Act of 2021. 
This legislation seeks to simplify and 
streamline the security screening proc-
ess for certain international air trav-
elers arriving in the U.S. 
It does so by directing the Transpor-
tation 
Security 
Administration 
to 
carry out a pilot program to allow pas-
sengers arriving from certain foreign 
airports to proceed directly to their 
connecting flights in the United States 
without having to go through the do-
mestic security screening process. 
Under current law, TSA is required 
to screen international passengers and 
their belongings upon their arrival in 
the U.S. before they can continue on to 
a connecting flight at a domestic air-
port. In practice, this means that upon 
landing, passengers must go through a 
TSA checkpoint with their carry-on 
items and have their checked baggage 
rescreened by TSA. 
Under the pilot program required 
under H.R. 4094, arriving international 
passengers would forego TSA screening 
when transferring to a domestic flight 
if they originated from certain airports 
where strong security measures are in 
place on the front end. 
As amended, this bill requires foreign 
airports participating in the pilot to 
uphold security screening standards 
and procedures that are comparable to 
those used by TSA. In doing so, pas-
sengers and their belongings at these 
airports will be securely screened be-
fore they arrive in the United States so 
they can more easily catch their con-
necting flight to their final destina-
tion. 
Beyond an improved passenger expe-
rience, requiring security standards 
and protocols at foreign airports to be 
on par with those used in the U.S. 
could help strengthen aviation security 
around the globe. 
Mr. Speaker, 20 years after 9/11, en-
hancing transportation security re-
mains a critical priority. With that, I 
support H.R. 4094, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5543 
September 29, 2021 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4094, the One-Stop Pilot Pro-
gram Act of 2021. This legislation will 
allow TSA to conduct a pilot program 
with select foreign airports that will 
make international air travel both 
more secure and more efficient. 
Streamlining international aviation 
security for passengers from certified 
foreign airports would not only encour-
age airports around the globe to reach 
U.S. security standards, but it will also 
help 
revitalize 
a 
struggling 
inter-
national aviation industry. This inno-
vative pilot program shows that it is 
possible to have both better security 
and a more seamless passenger experi-
ence. 
I thank Ranking Member KATKO for 
his tireless work with colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to bring this leg-
islation to where it is today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 4094, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to gentleman from New York 
(Mr. KATKO), the ranking member. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4094, 
the One-Stop Pilot Program Act of 2021 
authorizes the Transportation Security 
Administration to establish a pilot pro-
gram to streamline international trav-
el and enhance aviation security. 
Specifically, under this bill, inter-
national travelers from certified last 
point of departure airports would not 
need to be rescreened upon arrival in 
the United States for their domestic 
connecting flight. 
H.R. 4094 will improve international 
aviation security since participating 
LPD airports must elevate their level 
of security to that of the United States 
in order to be certified. Given the de-
sire and competition among inter-
national airports to participate, the 
one-stop security pilot will help to 
raise the global baseline of aviation se-
curity. 
The bill ensures robust oversight of 
the pilot program by requiring TSA to 
brief and certify to Congress that secu-
rity standards are maintained at par-
ticipating pilot airports. Additionally, 
the pilot program will inform Congress 
and DHS as to whether a more perma-
nent one-stop program is practical and 
beneficial to U.S. aviation security. 
One-stop screening would enable TSA 
to better utilize its screening work-
force and technology to help facilitate 
the increased travel volume as we 
emerge from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Just this morning, the TSA adminis-
trator testified before the Committee 
on Homeland Security about the secu-
rity and efficiency benefits that this 
pilot program will have on TSA’s oper-
ations. 
The pilot program will also provide 
international travelers with a more 
seamless and efficient travel experi-
ence. Travelers will no longer have to 
rush to be rescreened by TSA during 
their layover and will have more time 
at the airport without fear of missing 
their connecting flights. 
The aviation industry will also real-
ize efficiencies as a result of this bill. 
Air carriers will potentially be able to 
shorten connection times for travelers 
and streamline staffing at partici-
pating airports. U.S. airports will also 
see benefits as connecting travelers 
will have more time to dine and shop 
while on their layover. This is criti-
cally important as the travel and tour-
ism industry continues to struggle 
with the effects of this brutal pan-
demic. 
For these reasons, and many others, 
aviation and travel industry stake-
holders are very enthusiastic about 
this legislation, and I appreciate their 
strong support. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
letters of support from Airlines for 
America, the American Association of 
Airport Executives, and the Airports 
Council International North America. 
AIRLINES FOR AMERICA, 
Washington, DC, June 29, 2021. 
Ranking Member JOHN KATKO, 
House Committee on Homeland Security, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR RANKING MEMBER KATKO: I write to 
express Airlines for America’s (A4A) robust 
support for H.R. 4094, the ‘‘One-Stop Pilot 
Program Act of 2021.’’ This bill would serve 
as a critical tool for the Transportation Se-
curity Administration (TSA), partner gov-
ernments and the commercial aviation in-
dustry to pilot innovative ways to increase 
security at foreign last point of departure 
airports 
while 
increasing 
efficiency 
of 
screening for passengers and baggage within 
the United States. 
This bill would authorize a pilot program 
at 10 or fewer foreign last point of departure 
airports, permitting passengers flying from 
these airports and their carry-on baggage to 
continue to additional flights or flight seg-
ments within the U.S. without additional se-
curity rescreening. U.S. airlines have col-
laborated positively with the TSA on similar 
initiatives for years, but unfortunately our 
collective efforts have been stymied by out-
dated requirements in the Aviation and 
Transportation Security Act. 
By permitting the TSA to pilot a new con-
cept in a safe and controlled manner, it will 
be possible to demonstrate how such security 
enhancement programs may be permanently 
and broadly implemented. The bill is con-
sistent with standards and recommended 
practices set by the International Civil Avia-
tion Organization and puts the United States 
in a position to lead the international com-
munity on modern approaches to enhance 
aviation security. 
Safety and security are always the top pri-
orities of A4A and our member airlines, and 
we are encouraged that this bill maintains 
the high aviation security standards for 
flights into and within the United States. 
Upon passage, we look forward to continued 
collaboration with the TSA on all One-Stop 
security efforts. 
On behalf of the commercial U.S. aviation 
industry, A4A strongly supports this legisla-
tion. Thank you for your leadership on this 
issue. 
Sincerely, 
LAUREN BEYER, 
Vice President, Security and Facilitation, 
Airlines for America. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF 
AIRPORT EXECUTIVES, 
Alexandria, VA, June 29, 2021. 
Hon. JOHN KATKO, 
Ranking Members, Committee on Homeland Se-
curity, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR RANKING MEMBER KATKO: On behalf 
of the American Association of Airport Ex-
ecutives (AAAE) and the thousands of men 
and women across the country who manage 
and operate our nation’s airports, thank you 
for your continued leadership in Congress on 
aviation security issues. I am writing to ex-
press AAAE’s support for the ‘‘One Stop 
Pilot Program Act of 2021’’ that you intro-
duced earlier this week. 
This legislation would permit the Trans-
portation Security Administration (TSA) to 
conduct a three-year pilot program at up to 
10 airports at which connecting passengers’ 
and their carry-on baggage would not need 
to be rescreened upon arrival in the United 
States before connecting to another domes-
tic flight provided that the last point of de-
parture airport has a commensurate level of 
screening to the U.S. Some of AAAE’s air-
port members had been exploring this con-
cept with TSA prior to the COVID–19 pan-
demic as a way to eliminate screening redun-
dancy and improve passenger facilitation. 
We appreciate the necessary changes your 
legislation would make to permit this con-
cept to be tested on a pilot basis. 
Once international travel is allowed to 
fully resume, which AAAE and our airport 
members are eagerly awaiting and working 
to see implemented as quickly and safely as 
possible in concert with the federal govern-
ment, the One Stop Pilot Program will pro-
vide additional passenger facilitation solu-
tions to make international travel more 
seamless and secure. 
We appreciate your efforts to advance this 
security screening concept. Our member air-
ports remain interested in piloting this idea. 
AAAE stands ready to work with you to ad-
vance this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
STEPHANIE K. GUPTA, 
Senior Vice President, 
Security and Facilitation. 
AIRPORTS COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL, 
June 25, 2021. 
Hon. JOHN KATKO, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Se-
curity, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR RANKING MEMBER KATKO: On behalf 
of 
Airports 
Council 
International-North 
America, which represents local, regional, 
and state governing bodies that own and op-
erate commercial airports throughout the 
United States, I want to share our support of 
your new bill, H.R. 4094, the One-Stop Pilot 
Program Act. 
Airports welcome the introduction of this 
important legislation to establish a pilot 
program at the U.S. Department of Home-
land Security that would allow passengers 
and their baggage departing from approved 
foreign airports to continue onto their con-
necting flights without having to go through 
additional security screening. This one-stop 
security pilot would create needed effi-
ciencies by eliminating an unnecessary and 
burdensome rescreening process for pas-
sengers and baggage that were subject to a 
commensurate level of screening at their de-
parting airport. It also would allow TSA to 
reallocate scarce resources to augment staff-
ing at checkpoint and checked baggage 
screening locations. 
Thank you for your efforts to enhance 
aviation security and the passenger experi-
ence at America’s airports. I look forward to

continuing to work with you on these impor-
tant issues. 
Sincerely, 
KEVIN M. BURKE, 
President and CEO, Airports 
Council International—North America. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, lastly, I 
thank 
my 
friend, 
Representative 
STEPHANIE MURPHY from Florida, for 
her partnership on this bipartisan bill, 
and I thank Chairman THOMPSON, my 
friend, for his commitment to bringing 
it to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 4094. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I also have 
no further speakers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the pilot program au-
thorized under H.R. 4094 is intended to 
provide TSA and its international avia-
tion security partners with an oppor-
tunity to streamline travel and en-
hance security. 
Importantly, H.R. 4094 includes es-
sential security guardrails to ensure 
that the pilot is carried out in a way 
that does not result in lessened secu-
rity standards regarding, for example, 
the carriage of small knives on planes 
or the transfer of upstream passengers 
without rescreening. 
That is why the legislation, which 
was introduced by the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. KATKO), received bipar-
tisan support when it was approved by 
the Committee on Homeland Security 
in July. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4094, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 
4682, the Unmanned Aerial Security 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, to help carry out many 
of its many missions, the Department 
of Homeland Security has increasingly 
come to rely on drones. 
For instance, DHS utilizes drones to 
get ‘‘eyes in the sky’’ to make timely 
assessments about the extent of dam-
age caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, 
and other natural disasters in in-
stances in where FEMA cannot easily 
deploy personnel to affected areas by 
ground. 
In remote parts of the land border, 
DHS uses this technology to detect and 
prevent illicit drug activities. With so 
many unmanned aerial systems in the 
marketplace today developed in na-
tions that are considered foreign adver-
saries, there are legitimate security 
concerns about the integrity of data 
they collect. 
In fact, recent reports suggest that 
Chinese-manufactured drones might be 
compromised and used to send sen-
sitive information to the Chinese Gov-
ernment. In response to security con-
cerns, the Departments of Interior and 
Defense have taken steps to limit their 
use of foreign-made drones. 
H.R. 4682, the Unmanned Aerial Secu-
rity Act, would direct the Department 
of Homeland Security to take similar 
protective measures. It would prohibit 
DHS from purchasing or using drone 
systems manufactured in a foreign 
country that is deemed to be an adver-
sary by either the intelligence commu-
nity’s Annual Threat Assessment or 
the Secretary of Homeland Security. 
Importantly, H.R. 4682 does allow the 
DHS Secretary to waive the prohibi-
tion, case by case, in certain cir-
cumstances, such as for counter-drone 
research, testing, development, train-
ing, or for certain intelligence oper-
ations. 
H.R. 4682 has bipartisan support and 
was reported out of committee by voice 
vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4682, the Unmanned Aerial Se-
curity Act. 
It is imperative that the Department 
of Homeland Security be able to pro-
tect the Nation against all threats. 
This defense includes ensuring that the 
unmanned aircraft systems, commonly 
known as drones, that DHS uses and 
buys, are not made in foreign countries 
that do not align with our interests; 
countries such as China. 
DHS requires the dominant, air do-
main capabilities that drones provide 
to accomplish many of its land and 
maritime missions. We know that DHS 
uses drones for surveilling our south-
west border. Utilizing drones is a cost- 
efficient way to protect large areas of 
the homeland. 
However, many of the commercial 
drones used in the United States are 
manufactured in China, which domi-
nates the United States market. Of the 
top 10 drone manufacturers that supply 
the United States market, a single Chi-
nese manufacturer towers over all the 
others with nearly 77 percent of the 
market share. 
DHS has issued warnings in recent 
years about Chinese-made drones, spe-
cifically citing concerns that they may 
be sending sensitive data to their man-
ufacturers in China, where it can be 
accessed by the Chinese Government. 
Our colleagues in the Senate share 
our concern. In fact, Senator RICK 
SCOTT has introduced similar legisla-
tion to ban the purchase and use of 
these drones across the Federal Gov-
ernment, not just at DHS. 
Given the role that drones have in 
protecting homeland security, it is 
more important than ever to require 
DHS to assess its drone fleets. This bill 
would require DHS to provide a threat 
assessment 
report 
to 
Congress 
on 
whether the agency has analyzed the 
threat of its drone from adversarial na-
tions; the number of these drones that 
the Department is currently operating; 
and the extent to which the informa-
tion gathered by these drones may be a 
threat to the homeland or economic se-
curity of the United States. 
Second, the bill would prohibit DHS 
from buying or using drones made in 
adversarial nations going forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my friend and colleague, Ranking 
Member KATKO, for being an original 
cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation. 
Along with Members on the other side 
of the aisle, this is truly a bipartisan 
piece of legislation. 
With China looming as a growing 
threat on the horizon, maintaining our 
homeland security is of the utmost im-
portance, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no more speakers, and 
I am prepared to close after the gen-
tleman from Mississippi closes. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I urge all Mem-
bers to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend my col-
league from Mississippi (Mr. GUEST) for 
introducing this bill that seeks to en-
sure the integrity and security of the 
drone systems that the Department of 
Homeland Security operates. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4682, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4682, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4363, 
the DHS Contract Reporting Act of the 
2021. I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Department of 
Homeland Security spends billions of 
dollars each year to acquire goods and 
services needed to carry out its mis-
sions. 
It purchases everything from disaster 
relief supplies to passenger screening 
equipment to software designed to pro-
tect 
Federal 
Government 
networks 
from cyber threats. 
The Department’s Inspector General 
and the Government Accountability 
Office 
have 
consistently 
identified 
challenges with respect to DHS con-
tract management efforts. 
For instance, the DHS Inspector Gen-
eral has identified instances where 
FEMA awarded contracts to inexperi-
enced vendors that were unable to de-
liver critical supplies in response to 
major disasters. 
In June 2020, GAO determined that 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
had misspent funding that Congress 
specifically appropriated for migrant 
medical care and related supplies. 
H.R. 4363 seeks to improve visibility 
in DHS’ contract awards by requiring 
daily reporting of contract awards on 
the Department’s public website. The 
reports are to include key information 
about the award, such as the purpose of 
the contract and where work is ex-
pected to be performed. 
The reports are also to include infor-
mation about the award recipient, such 
as the name of the company and 
whether it is considered a small busi-
ness. 
H.R. 4363 has bipartisan support and 
was reported out of committee by voice 
vote. Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4363, the DHS Contract Report-
ing Act of 2021. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, along with its component agen-
cies, is appropriated billions of dollars 
every year to carry out its mission. 
This legislation, authorized by my col-
league, Representative HARSHBARGER, 
will bring long overdue transparency to 
the money DHS spends when con-
tracting services from the private sec-
tor. 
I 
commend 
Representative 
HARSHBARGER
for her legislation to 
battle waste, fraud, and abuse, and to 
ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent 
efficiently and transparently. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 4363, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no more speakers, and 
I am prepared to close after the gen-
tleman from Mississippi closes. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ten-
nessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER). 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 4363, the 
DHS Contract Reporting Act of 2021. 
Improving transparency and account-
ability is an essential way for the 
America people to gain and have con-
fidence in their government and the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
Currently, there is no clear line of 
sight into DHS’ purchasing decisions. 
Even though DHS is required to report 
some contract awards to the House and 
Senate Appropriations Committees, it 
is not required to report them to other 
committees with oversight responsibil-
ities such as ours, the House Com-
mittee on Homeland Security. 
And most importantly, if the Amer-
ican people want to know where their 
tax dollars are going, that information 
is almost impossible to find. 
Today, if someone wanted to find a 
DHS contract award, they would have 
to know how to use and navigate the 
cumbersome Federal data systems, and 
even then they may not be successful if 
they don’t already know some key de-
tails about the contract. 
Furthermore, DHS acquisition man-
agement is still on the Government Ac-
countability 
Office’s 
high-risk 
list. 
GAO reports that although DHS has 
taken steps to strengthen its acquisi-
tion requirements development proc-
ess, DHS continues to face challenges 
in effectively executing its acquisition 
portfolio, with many programs not 
meeting the cost and schedule goals 
they establish. 
I want to change this. The bill I am 
putting forward today will increase the 
transparency into these contracts. The 
DHS Contract Reporting Act of 2021 re-
quires DHS to have a public facing 
website where it will report all con-
tract awards over $4 million. 
To illustrate the current opaqueness 
of our oversight, I want to ask: Does 
anybody here know whether all the 
DHS contracts that should have been 
awarded competitively actually were? I 
don’t know the answer. But I do know 
that competition and contract awards 
helps to lower the cost of services and 
technologies the Department buys, and 
to get the best return on investment 
for the American taxpayer. 
To get at this type of information 
and to have more insight into DHS’ 
awards more generally, this bill also 
requires DHS to include key aspects of 
each contract award it reports, such as 
the total amount it plans to spend; 
what the contract is for; what type of 
agreement it is; and whether the gov-
ernment competed the contract award. 
According to the government’s top 
100 contractors report for 2020, DHS 
alone awarded over $12 billion to its 
top 100 contractors. And this is an in-
crease in spending of $1 billion from 
just the previous year. 
b 1645 
This includes everything from drones 
and IT systems to medical services at 
the border. With these significant lev-
els of increased spending, it is crucial 
that Congress have better oversight of 
DHS contracts. 
If this requirement would have been 
in place last year, the American people 
and Congress would have had that in-
sight into nearly 1,000 contracts DHS 
awarded in 2020. We need to put this re-
quirement in place now so that Con-
gress can ensure better stewardship of 
taxpayer dollars next year. 
With 
increased 
Federal 
spending 
across the board, it is more important 
than ever that this committee does its 
job to ensure DHS is being a good stew-
ard of taxpayer dollars. More account-
ability will make the Department a 
better business partner and a better 
provider of services to the public, and 
that is why I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
I would like to thank Ranking Mem-
ber KATKO and Representatives LURIA 
and SLOTKIN for reaching across the 
aisle and cosponsoring this bill with 
me. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time, and I am prepared to close.

Mr. Speaker, DHS obligated the $20 
billion on goods and services in fiscal 
year 2020, making it the fourth highest 
spending civilian agency in the Federal 
Government. 
Congress has a responsibility to en-

present during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
and for other purposes be vacated, to 
the end that the motion be considered

f 
STRENGTHENING MENTAL HEALTH 
POLICIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, too often, 
our country fails to get people the 
mental healthcare they need. This is 
true for Americans of all ages, and it is 
particularly acute for our Nation’s col-
lege students. 
They face the hurdles of corporate 
greed in our healthcare system and 
stigma against mental health treat-
ment. But they also run into road-
blocks with unhelpful or, at times, ac-
tively harmful campus policies. 
Policymakers need to give students 
the tools they need to succeed so they 
can graduate and become leaders in our 
communities. 
I have written legislation, the Stu-
dent Mental Health Rights Act, that 
would strengthen mental health poli-
cies on college campuses to better pro-
tect young people struggling with men-
tal health challenges. 
Students have begun a third school 
year disrupted by COVID–19. They con-
tinue to face the challenges of being 
physically isolated from their peers 
and navigating remote or hybrid in-
struction. 
The problem is clear: Protecting stu-
dents’ health is urgent and necessary.

b 1800 
MLB RESOLUTION 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to ask my colleagues to 
support legislation that I, along with 
Representative JIM HAGEDORN, are in-
troducing to ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to denounce Major League 
Baseball’s actions in closing a plant in 
Caledonia, 
Minnesota, 
and 
moving 
manufacturing 
jobs 
to 
communist 
China. 
For more than two decades, Miken 
Sports has been located in the Cal-
edonia community. As an integral 
small business, Miken employs nearly 
150 hardworking Americans. This deci-
sion to close the plant and move jobs 
to China directly defies Major League 
Baseball’s position as America’s pas-
time. 
There is nothing American about 
outsourcing jobs to China, removing 
income from American workers, and 
destroying a community’s economy. 
We know that very well in Atlanta, 
Georgia. 
Major League Baseball should be an 
unquestionable supporter of American 
jobs. The League’s decision to close the 
plant and move those jobs to China is 
incredibly 
disheartening. 
America’s 
pastime should be supported by Amer-
ican-made products and jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Major League 
Baseball to live up to its responsibility 
to the American people by reversing 
this decision to keep these jobs at 
home and to purchase American-made 
products, and I ask my colleagues for 
their support. 
f 
INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise

the historic bipartisan Investment and 
Jobs Act. This bill will provide critical 
funding to rebuild our Nation’s phys-
ical infrastructure and accelerate our

shift to green energy, all while cre-
ating good-paying jobs in communities 
like mine. 
In North Carolina, more than 3,000 
miles of highway and 1,400 bridges need 
repair. The average driver spends $500 a 
year on vehicle maintenance costs, 
thanks to this rundown infrastructure. 
More than 400,000 North Carolina 
residents lack adequate access to inter-
net. This bill expands broadband ac-
cess, helping to ensure that everyone 
has the tools they need to stay con-
nected and participate fully in school 
and in remote work. 
All these investments create good- 
paying jobs, spurring economic devel-
opment, and catapulting our Nation 
into the 21st century. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill. 
f 
ABORTION ON DEMAND BILL 
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, I voted in opposition to one of 
the most radical attacks on the unborn 
that Congress has ever seen. 
H.R. 3755, the abortion on demand 
bill would create a dangerous national 
standard that would allow the execu-
tion of innocents solely because of 
their race, sex, or disability. 
Our Nation denounces those who de-
value life. We condemn China and 
North Korea for their human rights 
abuses, and yet, we must reconcile 
with the fact that some of our Nation’s 
leaders are devaluing the life of Amer-
ican babies. 
It is simple. Abortion is murder, and 
murder is wrong. ‘‘Thou shalt not kill’’ 
is not a statement to reject for the 
sake of politics. 
As a Catholic and a father, I will al-
ways defend the unborn. As a conserv-
ative Congressman, I will continue 
fighting to keep taxpayer dollars from 
being used to fund these violent proce-
dures. 
May God have mercy on us all. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE AND SOCIAL 
PROGRAMS 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, the Build 
Back Better Act is historic, but I want 
to focus on two of its most important 
programs: climate change and much- 
needed social programs. 
First, climate change, the most im-
portant issue facing the entire world, 
without exception. The U.S. can double 
its impact—reducing carbon emissions 
50 percent while creating 2 million jobs 
annually over the next 10 years in 
clean technologies. 
And the Build Back Better social pro-
grams respond to needs Americans 
have long prioritized. Among them, 
childcare and lower costs for Medicare 
and college tuition. 
Build Back Better pays over the long 
run with investments for reducing fast- 
rising climate change issues and pays 
right now with investments in much- 
needed social programs. 
f 
EROSION MITIGATION 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I just 
want to point out to the American pub-
lic and my colleagues in this Chamber 
and the U.S. Forest Service, the ex-
treme importance of all the fire devas-
tation we have had in Northern Cali-
fornia and the need to immediately get 
upon the effort to cover up the erosion 
that we are going to have there. 
We need to mitigate the erosion that 
has a great potential to be there. This 
fire here, the Dixie fire—currently al-
most put out—has reached, finally, 
nearly a million acres, on top of the 
fire last year and another 2 years be-
fore that. 
We have over 1.5 million acres that 
have burned and are now a repository 
for ash and erosion that is going to af-
fect what is known as the Feather 
River watershed, an extremely impor-
tant watershed to the California State 
Water Project whose customers num-
ber about 25 million people in Cali-
fornia, as well as much of agriculture. 
We need that erosion control to hap-
pen immediately, especially on the 
heels of the Beckwourth fire, the Dixie 
fire, so that we don’t have our streams, 
our rivers, our lakes, plugged up with 
ash, with soil that makes it impossible 
for our water supply this coming year 
to be delivered to people in agriculture. 
f 
PRIORITIZE PANDEMIC 
PREPAREDNESS 
(Mr. TORRES of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, one of the central values of 
the Build Back Better Act is pandemic 
preparedness. 
COVID–19 has left a death toll of 
more than 600,000 Americans and a cost 
of $16 trillion. If the cataclysm of 
COVID–19 cannot move our country to 
prioritize pandemic preparedness, then 
nothing will. 
A wise person once said, Those who 
fail to learn from history are doomed 
to repeat it. And if we fail to pass the 
Build Back Better Act, we are in dan-
ger of reliving a history whose repeat 
we cannot afford. 
The Build Back Better Act would en-
able the United States to develop and 
distribute 
vaccines 
within 
a 
few 
months of a new pandemic threat. It 
would enable the United States to de-
velop vaccines not only for particular 
viruses but whole families of viruses 
with pandemic potential. It would 
shore up domestic manufacturing of 
critical supplies so that we are no 
longer at the mercy of a fragile global 
supply chain. 
We have the resources to prevent the 
next pandemic. The only question that 
remains is do we have the political will 
to Build Back Better.

f 
EXTENDING GOVERNMENT FUND-
ING 
AND 
EXTENDING 
EMER-
GENCY ASSISTANCE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
the CR, the Senate could take action 
as early as today to address a concern 
that demands the immediate attention 
of this Chamber: funding the Federal 
Government beyond September 30. 
To prevent a government shutdown, 
Senate Democrats will be introducing a 
continuing resolution that keeps the 
government open until early Decem-
ber, while also providing long-sought 
emergency funding to help Americans 
still reeling from natural disasters 
from this summer, as well as funding 
to help resettle Afghan refugees. We 
can approve this measure quickly and 
send it to the House so it can reach the 
President’s desk before funding expires 
midnight tomorrow. With so many 
critical issues to address, the last thing 
the American people need right now is 
a government shutdown. This proposal 
will prevent one from happening. 
I want to thank my colleagues who 
are working quickly to prepare this 
legislation. 
f 
DEBT LIMIT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on debt limit, of course, once we 
fund the government, we still need to 
address the urgent matter of extending 
the debt ceiling and preserving the full 
faith and credit of the United States. 
To paraphrase the economist Austan 
Goolsbee, who just met with our cau-
cus this morning, throughout history, 
there have certainly been governments 
that have defaulted on their debt, but 
never has there been a default caused 
by pure stupidity—in this case, Repub-
lican stupidity. 
Well, Democrats are working to pre-
vent such an outcome from happening 
now. Over the past week, our caucus 
has tried to find a workable solution to 
avoid default on our sovereign debt, 
but the Republicans have stymied us at 
every opportunity. 
On Monday, we considered a con-
tinuing resolution which, among other 
things, would have extended the debt 
ceiling until the end of 2022, allowing 
us to pay for the debt incurred by the 
previous administration. Republicans 
unanimously voted in favor of default. 
So, on Tuesday, we gave Republicans 
another chance. We offered to solve the 
debt ceiling impasse by doing exactly 
what Republicans claimed they wanted 
all along: Raise it with only Demo-
cratic votes. We gave them a chance to 
oppose it, like they said they would, 
and allow Democrats to solve this 
problem ourselves. Again, it was pre-
cisely what they asked for. And Leader 
MCCONNELL cited this precedent sev-
eral times in the last few days as to 
how to get out of the debt crisis. But 
once again, Republicans blocked that 
proposal in favor of default, and, quite 
frankly, no Republican provided a good 
answer as to why. When Leader MCCON-
NELL came out to rebut, he didn’t dis-
cuss the merits of our proposal. He 
said: We don’t want Democrats going 
forward and doing other things. 
Well, this is about debt that we have 
already incurred, debts from the past, 
spending from the past. It is not about 
the future. 
If we never did debt ceiling—if we al-
ways let the debt ceiling lapse because

September 29, 2021 
one party or the other didn’t like some 
future action that the other party 
would take, we would never do it. It is 
an absurd argument—an absurd argu-
ment—because they have no real argu-
ments because we were doing exactly— 
exactly—what Republicans have asked 
for: Pass it with your own votes. 
So Democrats have offered Repub-
licans multiple, entirely reasonable 
ways to get out of the mess they cre-
ated, but instead of stepping aside and 
letting the responsible party address 
the debt limit, Republicans have cho-
sen to actively obstruct. Again, we are 
not asking for Republicans to support 
raising the debt ceiling. If they want to 
stop payments from going to veterans 
and Social Security recipients, be our 
guest. We are just asking for Repub-
licans to get out of the way. Get out of 
the way, and let us do what they say 
they wanted us to do: Raise the debt 
ceiling without their votes. 
Time is short. The danger is real. 
Yesterday, 
the 
Treasury 
Secretary 
wrote that if the debt ceiling is not ad-
dressed by October 18, the government 
could enter a catastrophic default— 
catastrophic—for the first time in his-
tory. 
Secretary Yellen’s warning was un-
mistakable. A default would be ‘‘disas-
trous for the American economy, glob-
al financial market and millions of 
families and workers whose financial 
security would be jeopardized by a 
delay in payments.’’ Yet, every day, 
the outcome grows more and more 
likely because of Republican intran-
sigence, because Republicans are delib-
erately 
preventing 
the 
government 
from being able to pay its bills. 
Now, in solving this crisis, this body 
cannot and will not go through a 
drawn-out, 
unpredictable 
process 
sought by the minority leader. It risks 
the full faith and credit of the United 
States. To do this through reconcili-
ation requires ping-ponging separate 
bills back from the Senate and the 
House. It is unchartered waters. Indi-
vidual Senators could move to delay 
and delay and delay. It is very risky 
and could well lead us to default, even 
if only one Senator wanted that to hap-
pen. That is very possible. So you can’t 
do it this route. Everyone who has 
studied it knows it is risky, and it is 
simply a political gambit by Leader 
MCCONNELL, who has changed his tune 
several different times. He said over 
and over again: Just you Democrats 
vote for it. We give them that chance. 
Now, he has backed off that and moved 
into this untenable excuse. It is not a 
real answer. 
If the Republicans really want to pre-
vent a default like they claim they do, 
they should step aside and let Demo-
crats do the responsible thing. As de-
fault gets closer and closer to becom-
ing a reality, our Republican col-
leagues will be forced to ask them-
selves how long they are going to keep 
playing political games while the eco-
nomic stability of our country is at 
risk. At stake is the well-being of mil-
lions of Americans who did not ask for 
any of this and would suffer immensely 
because of Republican obstruction. If 
Republicans choose to keep making 
this harder, if Republicans choose to 
drag out this process, they will own the 
consequences of their default. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE CAL-
ENDAR EN BLOC—S. 2868, H.R. 3755 
AND H.R. 5323 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand there are three bills at the 
desk due for a second reading en bloc. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The clerk will read the bills by 
title for the second time. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2868) to temporarily extend the 
public debt limit until December 16, 2022. 
A bill (H.R. 3755) to protect a person’s abil-
ity to determine whether to continue or end 
a pregnancy, and to protect a healthcare pro-
vider’s ability to provide abortion services. 
A bill (H.R. 5323) making supplemental ap-
propriations for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2022, and for other purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bills on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I will object to fur-
ther proceeding en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will be 
placed on the calendar. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
American people continue to hear 
about a steady stream of really bad 
ideas that Washington Democrats are 
packing into their next reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree. 
There is one clear thread that sort of 
ties it all together—pain for American 
families and profit for our adversaries, 
hurting families and helping China. It 
is a perfect policy storm that would 
stick working Americans with higher 
prices, higher taxes, fewer jobs, and 
less freedom, while also putting Amer-
ica at a global disadvantage. 
That is true about the radical envi-
ronmental policies, as I explained yes-
terday. It is true about the Big Govern-
ment healthcare provisions that would 
leave us with fewer new drugs and 
fewer cures. It was true about the 
Democrats’ efforts to stuff a big am-
nesty for illegal immigrants into the 
bill. And it is especially true about the 
tidal wave of huge tax hikes and IRS 
snooping that Democrats are putting 
together behind closed doors: taxes on 
small 
businesses, 
taxes 
on 
family 
farms, double taxes on the ones who 
pass the reins to the next generation, 
new taxes that would make America 
one of the least hospitable places in the 
world to invest, grow a business, or 
create jobs. 
Nonpartisan analysis has confirmed 
there would be new taxes for big 
chunks—big chunks—of the 98 percent 
of Americans who make less than 
$400,000 a year, shattering President 
Biden’s pledge to leave their wallets 
alone. 
And then there is the bizarre, un-
popular new plan to give the IRS big 
new power to snoop into all of Amer-
ica’s personal financial transactions in 
excess of a few hundred dollars. 
Currently, the government has spe-
cial authorities to demand information 
on citizens’ transactions in excess of 
$10,000. In theory, this is a targeted 
tool for sniffing out things like money 
laundering, terrorism, or massive tax 
fraud. 
Now, the Democrats want to create a 
new reporting requirement, not for 
$10,000 transactions but for anything 
over a few hundred bucks. If American 
families are sending or receiving $600 
from their checking accounts, Demo-
crats want the IRS to snoop through 
it—a massive new dragnet that would 
sweep up all kinds of ordinary trans-
actions 
that 
normal, 
law-abiding 
Americans make all the time. In effect, 
Democrats want to let the IRS system-
atically snoop through normal fami-
lies’ checking accounts as though they 
were all potential financial criminals 
until proven otherwise. 
And then there was the latest fas-
cinating statement from the authors of 
this awful plan. President Biden re-
cently tried to suggest that, because 
they want to pair their reckless spend-
ing with their biggest tax hike in half 
a century, that somehow makes the en-
tire package free. The President says it 
is free? Democrats want to jack up 
Americans’ tax rates, drain money 
from people’s pockets, spend it on so-
cialism, and then say the whole thing 
nets out to zero dollars? 
This might be the best encapsulation 
of Washington-Democrat thinking I 
have ever heard. They want to print 
and borrow trillions of dollars and then 
set it on fire. But as long as they send 
your taxes skyrocketing at the same 
time, it is all a wash. Heads, they win. 
Tails, you lose. Heads, Democrats 
waste your money. Tails, they hike 
your taxes. 
This silly magical thinking rightly 
earned our President multiple—mul-
tiple—Pinocchios from fact-checkers. 
And Democrats’ reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree will earn it zero votes 
from Senate Republicans.

September 29, 2021 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a completely different matter, yes-
terday, under oath, General McKenzie 
and General Milley both confirmed 
they also agreed with the commander 
on the ground. They agreed we should 
keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. These 
top generals gave President Biden ex-
actly the advice the President told the 
American people he had not received. 
To be very clear, the Commander in 
Chief gets to make the final decision, 
no matter what the advisers suggest. 
But he needs to own his decision. 
The President publicly misstating 
what advice he got from his top gen-
erals is corrosive to the civil-military 
dynamic that keeps America safe. 
The military did their job. They gave 
their best military advice. It was re-
jected. So they saluted and executed 
the order of the Commander in Chief. 
That is the way it is supposed to work. 
But having rejected their advice, the 
President doesn’t get to claim he never 
received it, nor does he get to claim, as 
he has since tried to pretend, that the 
only alternative to his botched retreat 
was sending 10,000 soldiers back to Af-
ghanistan. 
That is a false choice. We have heard 
directly from the two senior military 
officers in the chain of command, as 
well as the President’s principal mili-
tary adviser, the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs. 
Everyone with an ounce of common 
sense knows President Biden’s botched 
retreat was not the extraordinary suc-
cess the President claimed. As General 
Milley acknowledged, it is more accu-
rate to describe the withdrawal as a 
strategic failure. 
We have now heard confirmation 
from our top military officers that the 
terrorist threat in Afghanistan is al-
ready growing. And relying on over- 
the-horizon counterterrorism leaves us 
with much less ability to do anything 
at all about it. 
What a debacle. We face a greater 
terrorist threat from Afghanistan than 
we did before we withdrew, we have 
less intelligence about that growing 
threat, and we have fewer tools with 
which to combat it. This administra-
tion gave our enemies in Afghanistan 
everything they wanted and got less 
than nothing in return. 
So, Mr. President, I know some of my 
colleagues want to unilaterally declare 
an end to the War on Terrorism. Ah, if 
only it were that easy. But the terror-
ists aren’t through with us. 
I hope my Democratic colleagues will 
think twice before they compound the 
failures in Afghanistan by trying to 
narrow or repeal the 2001 authorization 
for the use of military force. I, for one, 
will strenuously oppose any further ef-
forts by the Democratic administration 
or this Democratic Congress to take 
away any more tools or authorities 
that our military servicemembers and 
intelligence professionals need to keep 
our country safe from our enemies. 
At some point we will have a dif-
ferent administration that will better 
understand how to protect America for 
the long term. At this rate, they will

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in a few 
moments, I am going to make a unani-
mous consent request in regard to 
Dilawar Syed to be the Deputy Admin-
istrator of the Small Business Admin-
istration. 
Let me give you a little bit of back-
ground on Mr. Syed’s nomination and 
why I am using this unusual process to 
advance the nomination to the floor for 
floor consideration. 
We all know the tremendous need at 
the Small Business Administration as 
a result of COVID–19. We worked to-
gether, Democrats and Republicans, 
and created many new programs to 
help small businesses. We created the 
Paycheck Protection Program, both 
the first—and we modified it—and then 
a second round. We created the Eco-
nomic Injury Disaster Loan and Loan 
Advance Program and the Targeted 
Grant Program. 
We provided for the Shuttered Venue 
Operators Grant Program, we estab-
lished the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund, and the list goes on and on and 
on. All this created new programs and 
responsibilities for the Small Business 
Administration. And we did this to-
gether, Democrats and Republicans, in 
order to advance the needs for small 
businesses during COVID–19. 
Over $1 trillion of funds were admin-
istered by the Small Business Adminis-
tration as a result of our initiatives. 
And our constituents had tremendous 
needs. Tens of millions of small busi-
nesses have benefited from what we did 
to help them through COVID–19. 
I know that every one of our offices 
has gotten numerous inquiries from 
small businesses as to how these pro-
grams were stood up, whether they 
could qualify, concerns about their ap-
plications being filed promptly, the

September 29, 2021 
lack of funds, the need to replenish 
funds—the list goes on and on and on. 
That put tremendous demand on the 
Small Business Administration, and we 
were pretty tough on the Small Busi-
ness Administration to get these pro-
grams up and running because we knew 
how desperate it was for our small 
business community. 
Now, the Deputy Administrator’s job 
is to oversee the day-to-day operations 
of the Agency. That is the position we 
are talking about for Mr. Syed—the 
Deputy Administrator of the Small 
Business Administration. 
Over 5 months ago, the Small Busi-
ness Committee, under my leadership 
as chair, had a hearing on Mr. Syed’s 
appointment, and we discovered during 
that nomination process that he is ex-
tremely well qualified to assume these 
responsibilities. He has spent decades 
building and developing and scaling 
successful small businesses, as well as 
his advocacy for underserved small 
businesses. 
The hearing, I thought, went ex-
tremely well and that we would have 
no difficulty advancing his nomination 
to the floor of the U.S. Senate. But 
after his hearing, my Republican col-
leagues requested information from the 
Small Business Administration about 
his loans that he took out as a small 
business owner. It was a reasonable re-
quest. On June 8, I helped arrange to 
supply that information to the mem-
bers of the committee, and they re-
viewed his small business loan applica-
tions, Mr. Syed’s small business appli-
cations. 
There was one thing that was pretty 
unusual about that in that even though 
he was qualified to receive forgivable 
7(a) loans under the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, he decided to repay the 
loans because he said he didn’t need 
the government to pay on a forgivable 
loan. He took exemplary action, and 
after the review, I believe all my col-
leagues were satisfied that his arrange-
ments with the SBA were exemplary. 
Next, the Republicans decided to 
move to a different target. They ac-
cused Mr. Syed of being anti-Israel bi-
ased, which was completely, com-
pletely unfounded. 
The American Jewish Committee 
wrote our committee to say: 
The unsupported accusations that some-
how Jewish businesses or those with ties to 
Israel may not fare as well under Syed’s 
leadership in the Small Business Adminis-
tration has no factual grounding. Indeed, he 
has specifically disavowed support for the 
boycott, divestment, and sanctions move-
ment, which seeks the dissolution of Israel. 
. . . AJC rejects the charge. 
They go on to say it is un-American, 
the charges that have been made, and I 
agree. 
My colleagues had the right to ask 
questions for the record, and they did. 
Mr. Syed responded to those questions 
for the record, again repeating the fact 
that he has been against the Boycott, 
Divestment, and Sanctions movement 
and that he has worked with companies 
in Israel and, in fact, visited Israel in 
order to promote the relationships. 
Again, we thought, now, at last, we 
will be able to move Mr. Syed’s nomi-
nation. But now the Republicans found 
a new reason to block his nomination. 
Committee 
Republicans 
announced 
that they would withhold a quorum on 
the vote because Planned Parenthood 
affiliates received loans under the Pay-
check Protection Program. 
As one of the negotiators of the 
CARES Act—and this was Democrats 
and Republicans again working to-
gether; negotiated this with Senator 
RUBIO, Senator COLLINS, and Senator 
SHAHEEN. Let me explain to my col-
leagues how nonprofits are treated 
under the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. 
When the SBA considers whether or 
not a business qualifies as a small busi-
ness, it considers affiliation. Generally, 
affiliations exist when one business 
controls or has the power to control 
another or when a third party controls 
or has the power to control both busi-
nesses. Control may arise with owner-
ship, management, or other relation-
ships or interactions between the par-
ties. 
The CARES Act requires that non-
profits eligible for PPP loans abide by 
the same affiliation rules that are ap-
plicable to small businesses. 
The fact is that the Planned Parent-
hood Federation of America does not 
exercise control over its member orga-
nizations because it does not have com-
mon management. Each member orga-
nization is its own independent, not- 
for-profit, 
tax-exempt 
organization 
with its own independent board of di-
rectors that is solely responsible for 
the hiring and retention of its CEO. 
Planned Parenthood Federation does 
not have the power to remove CEOs or 
directors of its individual member or-
ganizations. 
This type of federated structure is 
common in the nonprofit world and is 
the reason why nonprofits such as the 
YMCA and Boys and Girls Clubs also 
qualify for PPP loans. 
The SBA must apply its affiliation 
rules in a uniform way, and it is wrong 
to ask the SBA to do otherwise for po-
litical or ideological reasons. There is 
no reason why Planned Parenthood 
should be singled out for receiving PPP 
loans, which I must remind my col-
leagues were created to help keep 
Americans in their jobs during the pan-
demic. That is the reason for it. That is 
why we included nonprofits. 
The partisan, unnecessary, and un-
conscionable inaction of our Repub-
lican colleagues shows no concern for 
the millions of small businesses still 
relying on SBA support to survive 
COVID–19 and rebuild their future and 
that would benefit greatly by having a 
confirmed Deputy Administrator to 
work on the day-to-day operations at 
the SBA. 
One last point, if I might. The Small 
Business Committee reported out Mr. 
Syed’s nomination by a bipartisan 
vote, but due to a technicality, another 
vote was required, and the Republican 
members at this time decided to block 
the quorum. 
As a matter of fairness, as a matter 
of the needs of the small business com-
munity in our States, as a matter of 
the integrity of this body to have a 
process that has some degree of respect 
for the nominees who go through the 
nomination process, I am going to 
make a UC request that the nomina-
tion be put on our calendar, like any 
other reported nominee, subject to the 
action of this body. 
Before I make that unanimous con-
sent request, with Senator PAUL’s in-
dulgence, I know that Senator PADILLA 
would like to make a comment. If he 
would be willing to allow Senator 
PADILLA to speak next, and then I will 
make my unanimous consent request. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I want 
to join Chairman CARDIN in calling at-
tention to the unacceptable obstruc-
tion by our Republican colleagues who 
are doing nothing other than playing 
political games with the confirmation 
process. 
Dilawar Syed is an outstanding and 
highly qualified nominee to serve as 
Deputy Administrator of the Small 
Business 
Administration. 
Mr. 
Syed 
brings decades of experience as a busi-
ness leader and entrepreneur in a num-
ber of fields. He is a dedicated public 
servant who helped guide President 
Obama’s support of Asian-American 
small business owners in the wake of 
the great recession, and he has served 
as the founding chair of the California 
Entrepreneurship Task Force. 
He has earned support from business 
groups and on both sides of the aisle. 
Notably, the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce 
enthusiastically 
announced 
their support for his nomination, citing 
his very impressive background. 
In June of this year, two of our Re-
publican colleagues joined the Demo-
cratic members of the Small Business 
Committee and voted to send Mr. 
Syed’s nomination to the full Senate 
for confirmation. But, today, Repub-
licans are refusing to allow the Senate 
to vote on his nomination. In so doing, 
they are also obstructing the work of 
the SBA itself—work that has never 
been more critical. 
As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
wrote back in April, ‘‘It is essential for 
SBA’s senior leadership team to be in 
place 
to 
deliver 
on 
the 
agency’s 
COVID–19 small business emergency re-
lief responsibilities.’’ Again, critical. 
Mr. Syed is ready to serve with dedi-
cation and skill as the SBA pursues its 
mission of supporting economic growth 
for entrepreneurs and working fami-
lies. He is also ready to make history 
as the highest ranking Muslim official 
in any Presidential administration, 
and our Nation’s hard-working small 
business owners urgently need his lead-
ership.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6753 
September 29, 2021 
My Republican colleagues who are 
playing these political games to ob-
struct this nomination are also block-
ing resources needed by their own con-
stituents. 
Let’s end this, and I urge the Senate 
to swiftly confirm Mr. Syed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
PN231, the nomination of Dilawar Syed 
to be Deputy Administrator of the 
Small Business Administration; that at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader, in consultation with the Re-
publican leader, the Senate proceed to 
its consideration; that there be 1 hour 
for debate on the nomination equally 
divided in the usual form; that upon 
the use or yielding back of time, the 
Senate vote without intervening action 
or debate; that if confirmed, the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate and the Presi-
dent be immediately notified of the 
Senate’s actions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, this motion is an 
attempt to get around the ruling that 
the SBA has that Planned Parenthood 
is, indeed, a small business. This would 
allow illegal funding of Planned Par-
enthood affiliates through the Pay-
check Protection Program. 
Let’s be very clear. Planned Parent-
hood is not a small business; Planned 
Parenthood is a big business. This is 
not my allegation; this is a ruling from 
the Small Business Administration. 
The Small Business Administration 
ruled in May of 2020 that Planned Par-
enthood was a big business, not a small 
business, and ineligible for the PPP 
program. The program was intended for 
small businesses. The current ruling 
from the Small Business Administra-
tion is, they are ineligible because they 
are a big business. 
This program was intended to sup-
port small businesses across the coun-
try that were forced to lock down dur-
ing COVID–19. However, the Small 
Business Administration, despite hav-
ing previously ruled that they were in-
eligible, that they were a big business, 
has now unlawfully approved nearly 
$100 million in taxpayer funds to 
Planned Parenthood. On June 30 alone, 
the Small Business Administration ap-
proved four new loans to Planned Par-
enthood despite a clear determination 
by the Small Business Administration 
that these entities are ineligible. So we 
have a great contradiction here. They 
say they are ineligible. That is the ex-
isting rule from the Small Business Ad-
ministration. Yet they are still giving 
them money. 
This nomination is for the position of 
Deputy Administrator of the Small 
Business Administration, which is re-
sponsible for the Agency’s day-to-day 
operations and involved in all policy 
decisions, including the PPP program. 
The Biden administration has contin-
ued to obstruct congressional oversight 
of the illegal Planned Parenthood 
loans, and the nominee has refused to 
provide to the committee a commit-
ment that he would take action to re-
cover the funds that are being dis-
bursed illegally. 
The 
Republican 
members 
of 
the 
Small Business Committee have con-
tinued to make it clear that we will 
not allow a vote on this nominee to 
occur until the Small Business Admin-
istration takes action to recover the il-
legally disbursed funds to the big busi-
ness known as Planned Parenthood. 
I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). 
Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me 
just repeat a comment. I know Senator 
HIRONO is on the floor, and I want to 
give her an opportunity to speak on 
this, but let me make this clear. 
The affiliate rules that are used by 
the Small Business Administration are 
exactly the same for a for-profit or a 
nonprofit, and there are lots of small 
businesses that have a big name next 
to them that are eligible for the pro-
grams under the Small Business Ad-
ministration before COVID–19 and after 
COVID–19. The affiliation rules have 
been in the SBA for a long time, and I 
read them into the RECORD earlier in 
my comments. 
What they cannot do is pick and 
choose who they like and don’t like. 
That is not how you administer a pro-
gram. 
So, in the nonprofit world, I gave the 
example of the YMCAs—a pretty big 
name but, the truth of the matter is, 
they are all independently operated, 
and the national YMCA cannot dis-
charge the CEO of a local YMCA. So we 
judge the qualifications based upon the 
local activities. The same is true for a 
lot of affiliates on for-profit compa-
nies: big chains that are independently 
owned and not controlled. They can 
qualify for these funds. 
I can tell you a lot of organizations 
that are related in the faith commu-
nity to an umbrella, but they are not 
controlled, so, therefore, the affiliate 
rules allow them to apply independ-
ently for these funds as long as they 
can qualify. 
We knew that developing this pro-
gram. We didn’t want to change the af-
filiate rules because that would have 
been wrong. 
So what my colleague is requesting is 
just—would be illegal for the adminis-
tration to say that we are not going to 
select a particular group because we 
don’t particularly agree with what 
they are doing or how they operate. 
That is not how the rules work. That is 
not what you are allowed to do. 
So I regret that my colleague has 
raised these objections. I think it di-
minishes our credibility to tell our ad-
ministrators to administer these pro-
grams fairly for all constituencies. And 
to deny Small Businesses of America a 
confirmed Deputy Administrator dur-
ing these extremely challenging times 
for small businesses does not hurt Mr. 
Syed; it hurts the small business com-
munity. 
I thank Mr. Syed for his willingness 
to serve, and I hope we can find a path 
forward because this debate has noth-
ing to do with his qualifications or why 
he should be confirmed. 
With that, I will yield the floor. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in strong support of Dilawar 
Syed’s nomination to serve as Deputy 
Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration. 
I have a letter of support from the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus that I would ask unanimous 
consent to have printed into the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
SEPTEMBER 14, 2021. 
Hon. BEN CARDIN, 
Hon. RAND PAUL, 
U.S. Senate, Committee on Small Business & En-
trepreneurship, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR CARDIN AND RANKING MEMBER 
PAUL: As members of the Congressional 
Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), 
which is comprised of 76 members of Con-
gress, we write to strongly endorse the swift 
confirmation of Dilawar Syed, who has been 
nominated to serve as Deputy Administrator 
of the U.S. Small Business Administration 
(SBA). He has decades of experience in busi-
ness, entrepreneurship, and public service, 
making him extremely well-qualified for this 
position. 
AAPI small businesses have been espe-
cially hard hit during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. In fact, according to a report by the 
New York Federal Reserve, the Asian Amer-
ican community not only experienced the 
largest drop in entrepreneurship during the 
pandemic, but while other communities of 
color saw a rebound in entrepreneurship as 
the pandemic continued, that rebound had 
yet to happen for AAPIs. Mr. Syed has a long 
history working with all communities, but 
has particularly strong ties to the AAPI 
community, having served as a Commis-
sioner on the White House Commission on 
AAPIs. At this pivotal moment for AAPI 
small businesses, having Mr. Syed’s back-
ground represented at SBA is critical. 
Mr. Syed, an immigrant who has embodied 
the values of hard work and ingenuity, has 
built and scaled businesses with major im-
pacts in technology, healthcare, and business 
services. He has shown incredible prowess as 
an entrepreneur in business growth and de-
velopment. For example, as President of 
Freshworks, a customer service software 
company, Mr. Syed grew the company from a 
few dozen customers to thousands of small 
and medium businesses across the U.S. Dur-
ing his tenure as Commissioner on the White 
House Commission on AAPIs, Mr. Syed ac-
tively worked to connect entrepreneurs in 
underserved regions to the SBA and Depart-
ment of Commerce. From serving as the 
founding chair of the California Entrepre-
neurship Task Force to spearheading rapid 
response engagement during the COVID–19

pandemic with the state’s most vulnerable 
small businesses to increase awareness of 
critical programs like the SBA’s Paycheck 
Protection Program, Mr. Syed has consist-
ently helped empower and uplift our nation’s 
small businesses. 
Mr. Syed’s nomination has the support of 
more than 150 civic, government, higher edu-
cation and business leaders and organiza-
tions, including endorsements from the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Black Cham-
bers, National Asian/Pacific Islander Amer-
ican Chamber of Commerce & Entrepreneur-
ship, Small Business Roundtable, Anti-Defa-
mation League, American Jewish Congress, 
and many others. Upon confirmation, Mr. 
Syed would become the highest-ranking 
Muslim American in the Biden administra-
tion to date, as well as one of the highest- 
ranking AAPIs. 
However, we are disappointed to see the 
treatment Mr. Syed has received from those 
on the Committee that have held up his con-
firmation vote, based on false accusations, 
anti-Muslim sentiment, and efforts to ham-
string Committee business unless specific 
conditions on unrelated matters are met. 
Since June 16, the Committee has made 
three different attempts to consider Mr. 
Syed’s nomination, but each time certain 
members have challenged the proceedings or 
blocked them from moving forward. On two 
separate occasions, these members even boy-
cotted the proceedings—denying Mr. Syed 
fair consideration. Targeting nominees like 
Mr. Syed for their faith, ethnicity, or place 
of birth, furthers the perpetual foreigner 
stereotype to which AAPIs are constantly 
subjected. We stand firmly against the use of 
these typecasting misconceptions. These tac-
tics have been rejected by leading civil 
rights and faith-based organizations and 
have no place in our government or our na-
tion. There is no question that Mr. Syed is 
uniquely well suited and highly qualified for 
this role, and small business owners and en-
trepreneurs across the country deserve this 
standard of leadership at SBA. Continuing to 
block his nomination is a disservice to these 
business owners and entrepreneurs. 
The Deputy Administrator role has tradi-
tionally been focused on managing execution 
of SBA’s programmatic mission and day-to- 
day operations, which includes bringing des-
perately needed relief to struggling small 
businesses and entrepreneurs across the na-
tion. This position has been left vacant for 
over three years and continuing to do so pre-
vents the agency from having a fully staffed 
senior leadership team at a time when the 
SBA’s importance in our nation’s economic 
recovery is at an all-time high. 
Mr. Syed’s impressive background both in 
public service and the private sector in busi-
ness and entrepreneurship along with his 
leadership in the AAPI community will un-
doubtedly be assets in his role as SBA’s Dep-
uty Administrator. We are confident that 
Dilawar Syed is the perfect fit for this role 
and we urge the Committee to promptly 
move forward with his confirmation.

Judy Chu, Member of Congress, CAPAC

Ms. HIRONO. In the midst of the pan-
demic, what is normally a very bipar-
tisan small business committee, Re-
publicans are blocking Mr. Syed’s nom-
ination. This is particularly egregious 
behavior by Republicans on the com-
mittee because Mr. Syed is exception-
ally qualified to hold this position and 
is widely supported by business groups 
and communities across the country. 
In fact, let me read a paragraph from 
the Congressional Asian Pacific Amer-
ican Caucus letter that I just men-
tioned. 
I am reading from the letter: 
Mr. Syed’s nomination has the support of 
more than 150 civic, government, higher edu-
cation and business leaders and organiza-
tions, including endorsements from the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Black Cham-
bers, National Asian/Pacific Islander Amer-
ican Chamber of Commerce & Entrepreneur-
ship, Small Business Roundtable, Anti-Defa-
mation League, American Jewish Congress, 
and many others. Upon confirmation, Mr. 
Syed would become the highest ranking Mus-
lim American in the Biden administration to 
date, as well as one of the highest ranking 
AAPIs. 
Republicans have continued to block 
this nomination for months. Earlier 
this summer, they disputed the results 
of a meeting the committee had to ad-
vance the nomination. Since then, they 
have refused to show up for three other 
meetings, including one we held last 
week, denying the necessary quorum 
for a vote to be taken. 
The reasons for blocking Mr. Syed’s 
nomination have changed over time. 
First, they were concerned about SBA 
loans his company received during the 
pandemic, even though these loans 
were lawful and fully repaid before he 
was nominated. Then they insinuated 
he was somehow anti-Jewish and anti- 
Israel—note the groups that I read that 
have supported him—despite his wide-
spread support in these communities. 
And now, they are concerned about 
lawful SBA loans to Planned Parent-
hood Health Centers, something that 
Mr. Syed certainly had no control over. 
Throughout the last several months, 
Mr. Syed has repeatedly made himself 
available to address any concerns my 
colleagues might have about his back-
ground or qualifications, things that 
clearly matter in his ability to do the 
job. 
It boggles the mind that Republicans 
are blocking someone who is the very 
picture of the American dream: an en-
trepreneur, a job creator who was born 
in Pakistan and educated in America, 
who understands firsthand the chal-
lenges businesses have faced during 
this pandemic. Mr. Syed would be an 
asset to SBA and the businesses they 
serve, our own constituents. 
Every day that Republicans continue 
their obstruction, they are doing a dis-
service to these businesses who can 
least afford this uncertainty and tur-
moil in this moment. 
Mr. Syed deserves fair consideration. 
Republican efforts to block not just 
this nomination but so many others for 
the simple reason that they want to 
slow the process so that this adminis-
tration can have people in place who 
can actually do the job to help the 
American people—enough is enough. 
I just say to the Republicans: You 
know, put your votes where your 
mouths are. You say you support small 
businesses; you say you support this, 
that, and the other thing; and yet you 
will not let this administration get on 
with their job to do what is necessary 
to help small businesses, to help our 
communities, in the midst of an ongo-
ing pandemic. It boggles the mind. I 
say: Act like the Senators you are, who 
were sent here to do your job, and let’s 
get on with this nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Let me thank Senator 
HIRONO for her comments, and I also 
thank Senator PADILLA for his com-
ments. 
I have never gone through something 
like this before, where the Republicans 
are breaking a quorum after they have 
already voted a nominee for reasons 
unrelated to the nominee. It makes no 
sense, and the reasons that they are 
using makes no sense at all, since they 
are asking the SBA to violate the law. 
We are going to continue. As chair of 
the committee, I am going to continue 
to look at every conceivable way that 
we can get Mr. Syed confirmed. I think 
he is an extraordinary person who will 
serve our Nation with great distinc-
tion, and I know our small business 
community needs a confirmed Deputy 
Administrator. 
You know, what surprises me is that 
our Republican colleagues talk about 
their support for small businesses, and 
I said we worked on COVID together to 
create 
these 
programs. 
President 
Trump never filled the position of Dep-
uty Administrator so this position has 
been vacant for a long time. 
We need this position. The small 
business community needs this posi-
tion. So it is my hope that we will find 
a path forward as quickly as possible to 
get this nomination confirmed. I am 
confident that we will get a strong bi-
partisan vote for Mr. Syed’s nomina-
tion and confirmation. Republicans tell 
me they think he is well qualified. 
So let’s stop using these parliamen-
tary procedures to obstruct. Let’s get 
on with the business of the Senate. 
I would suggest the absence of a 
quorum.

September 29, 2021 
hearing, we now know that President 
Biden pulled troops from Afghanistan 
against the advice of his military com-
manders and was less than truthful 
after the fact when asked about their 
recommendations. 
General 
Milley 
and 
General 
McKenzie’s testimony made clear that 
they had both recommended that the 
United States leave a small contingent 
of U.S. troops in the country—advice 
that the President ignored. 
Thanks to President Biden’s ill-con-
sidered withdrawal from Afghanistan, 
here is the situation we now find our-
selves in. The Taliban is once again in 
control of Afghanistan, and just in case 
anyone thinks this is a kinder and 
gentler Taliban, let’s look at the facts. 
The Taliban has stocked its govern-
ment with terrorists, including former 
inmates of Guantanamo Bay and mem-
bers of the Haqqani Network, a U.S.- 
designated foreign terrorist organiza-
tion with a number of members on the 
U.N. Security Council’s sanctions list. 
Many of the members of the new 
Taliban Cabinet are on the U.N. Secu-
rity Council’s sanctions list, and the 
government is well stocked with pre-9/ 
11 Taliban leaders, the same leaders 
who allowed Afghanistan to serve as a 
refuge for al-Qaida. 
So that is the new Taliban govern-
ment. What is it doing? Well, in mid- 
September the Taliban announced that 
secondary schools would reopen for 
boys. There was no mention of girls. 
The Taliban official announced that 
women would not be allowed to play 
any sport that might show their bodies. 
Women are being excluded from the 
workplace. 
In Helmand province, barbers have 
been barred from shaving or trimming 
beards. 
In one city, the body of an alleged 
criminal was hung from a crane in the 
city square, while in Kabul, Taliban 
members brutally flogged a man ac-
cused of stealing a phone. And a senior 
Taliban leader announced the return of 
executions and the cutting off of hands 
as punishment. 
A kindler, gentler Taliban this is not. 
And this formerly somewhat ragtag 
group is now the possessor of a signifi-
cant amount of U.S. military equip-
ment, including weapons, combat vehi-
cles, aircraft, and surveillance equip-
ment, much of it acquired from the Af-
ghan National Security Forces. 
And while the President might like 
to blame the Afghan forces for dis-
banding, the truth is he bears part of 
the responsibility for their collapse. 
For years, the United States trained 
and equipped Afghan troops to fight 
the way that we do, including a reli-
ance on close air support and a sophis-
ticated 
intelligence-gathering 
oper-
ation. And the limited number of U.S. 
troops still in the country were playing 
an 
essential 
role—providing 
intel-
ligence, logistics, and air support the 
Afghan military needed. 
Then the President pulled all remain-
ing U.S. support almost overnight. It is 
no surprise that in the wake of that, 
the Afghan military quickly collapsed. 
There is no question that there were 
preexisting problems in the Afghan 
forces, including fraud and corruption. 
But the Afghan military was playing a 
key role in combating the Taliban and 
terrorist activity in Afghanistan, and 
it was the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. 
support that precipitated its collapse. 
Thanks to the President’s with-
drawal, our ability to combat terrorist 
activity in Afghanistan and the region 
has been significantly degraded, as 
General Milley’s testimony yesterday 
made clear. As the Washington Post re-
ported: 
Al-Qaeda remnants are in Afghanistan and 
interested in growing, Milley said, but the 
United States no longer has military or in-
telligence assets on the ground to keep tabs 
on the militants. 
The withdrawal makes it ‘‘much more dif-
ficult for us to conduct intelligence, surveil-
lance, reconnaissance,’’ Milley said, includ-
ing missions to locate militants. 
That, again, is from the Washington 
Post. 
In short, there is every reason to ex-
pect that Afghanistan will once again 
become a haven for terrorists. In fact, 
because of the huge number of weapons 
and equipment we left behind, it is 
probably more accurate to say that Af-
ghanistan will likely become a ter-
rorist superstate. Meanwhile, as I said, 
our ability to effectively detect and de-
fend against emerging threats in Af-
ghanistan has been significantly dimin-
ished. There is no intelligence or coun-
terterrorism strategy that will fully 
offset the loss of American boots on 
the ground. 
U.S. military and intelligence per-
sonnel still in the country, in coordina-
tion with our local partners, were play-
ing a critical role in providing intel-
ligence on evolving terrorist threats in 
Afghanistan and throughout the re-
gion. That intelligence network is now 
gone. We no longer have human intel-
ligence on the scene. 
We no longer have any bases in-coun-
try from which to conduct operations. 
Future missions will have to be staged 
from distant bases or seaborne assets, 
complicating the mission and signifi-
cantly increasing our response time. 
That is not just an inconvenience. By 
compromising our ability to respond to 
terrorist activity, this withdrawal is 
endangering our country. For 20 years, 
we have managed to prevent another 
major terrorist attack on U.S. soil. 
How long is that going to last when Af-
ghanistan is once again a haven for ter-
rorists and our intelligence and re-
sponse capabilities have been perma-
nently weakened? 
I haven’t even mentioned the damage 
that the President’s bungled with-
drawal has done to our relationships 
with our allies. The President, who, 
supposedly, was set to restore Amer-
ica’s standing in the world, is instead 
presiding over a national embarrass-
ment that has left our allies wondering 
whether or not we will keep our com-
mitments. We have damaged our credi-
bility with our allies. It is clear that 
Russia and China are enjoying our hu-
miliation on the world stage, not to 
mention the way that our withdrawal 
has empowered our terrorist enemies. 
Ceding Afghanistan to the Taliban 
and its terrorist allies has not exactly 
made us look like an intimidating foe. 
It wouldn’t be surprising if terrorists 
are thinking that all they have to do in 
future battles is wait us out until we 
give up and withdraw. 
I am sure the President would like to 
put his chaotic Afghanistan with-
drawal behind him, but there is a big 
problem with that—namely, the fact 
that his administration still has U.S. 
citizens left behind in Afghanistan. The 
administration has been hazy on the 
details, either because it is not sure 
how many American citizens are left or 
because administration officials don’t 
want to give a number. But it is clear 
that there are still a number of Ameri-
cans stuck in Afghanistan. 
And then there are the tens of thou-
sands of Afghans we abandoned—Af-
ghans who were affiliated with the U.S. 
Government or worked with the U.S. 
military and whom we promised to pro-
tect. These individuals and their fami-
lies are currently in grave danger. 
My office continues working to evac-
uate a number of green card holders 
and at-risk Afghans to safe countries 
in the region, and several of the indi-
viduals we are working with have re-
ceived death threats from the Taliban. 
And while there are dedicated State 
Department and Defense Department 
personnel coordinating with veteran- 
led groups to evacuate Afghan citizens, 
the 
administration 
is 
still—still— 
struggling to develop a clear path for 
getting them out of the country. 
We still need to learn more about the 
chaotic U.S. evacuation, which re-
sulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service-
members and scores of Afghan civil-
ians. But one thing is very clear: Presi-
dent Biden made an ill-considered and 
disastrous decision when he chose to 
withdraw our troops on an arbitrary 
timetable, and the Afghan people are 
currently suffering the consequences. 
And should Afghanistan once again 
become a terrorist haven, as seems 
likely, our country could also pay a 
deadly price. We have to make sure it 
doesn’t come to that.

Revenue Service data on the tax re-
turns of thousands of the nation’s 
wealthiest people, covering over 15 
years.’’ 
I have spoken about this apparent 
leak or hack on IRS data before. Dur-
ing the August recess, POLITICO Pro’s 
Morning 
Tax, 
writing 
about 
ProPublica, noted that ‘‘it’s been al-
most two-and-a-half months since it 
ran its first story on that leaked tax 
data and, though the leak is perhaps 
the worst in the IRS’s history, the gov-
ernment has yet . . . to say anything 
publicly about how it happened.’’ 
As absurd as that statement is, it is 
also accurate, and I will speak about 
the accuracy of that. The Biden admin-
istration has not said what happened 
regarding perhaps the worst leak or 
hack in the history of the IRS. 
Now, in doing my constitutional duty 
of congressional oversight, I have sent 
letters to the IRS and to the Attorney 
General and to the FBI, who have pro-
vided an embarrassingly small amount 
of information in response to my let-
ters. 
The first ProPublica story was pub-
lished on June 8 of this year. On June 
11, I joined Leader MCCONNELL and Fi-
nance Committee Ranking Member 
CRAPO on a letter to Attorney General 
Garland and FBI Director Wray. Days 
later, on June 16, I sent a letter with 
other Judiciary Committee members 
asking more detailed questions. 
It took almost 2 months for the De-
partment of Justice to respond to these 
letters by sending me two copies of the 
same form letter in response to my let-
ter. Dated August 10, one of the letters 
contains an apparent typo in that it 
purports to be in response to a letter 
‘‘dated June 6, 2021.’’ 
Given that ProPublica began pub-
lishing stories about this on June 8, if 
I was clairvoyant enough to write a 
letter on the leak 2 days earlier, I 
would already know what really hap-
pened. The fact that the Department 
responded to two different letters with 
the 
exact 
same 
form 
letter 
and 
couldn’t correctly refer to my letters 
shows a lack of diligence that is not 
unique to this matter. 
In response to a different letter I sent 
with Senator CRAPO to the Commis-
sioner of the IRS, Rettig, I received a 
recent response that states: ‘‘We do not 
yet have any information concerning 
the source of the alleged taxpayer in-
formation published by ProPublica.’’ 
Now, the IRS Commissioner is advo-
cating for Congress to pass an expan-
sive new reporting requirement for the 
IRS. Every bank account over $600 is 
going to be sent to the IRS for their re-
view and use if they want to go after 
the taxpayers. If Commissioner Rettig 
doesn’t 
even 
know 
whether 
the 
ProPublica information came from the 
IRS, how can he assure us the IRS can 
properly protect this new information 
that they want the Congress to pass? I 
don’t think he is going to be able to 
convince anybody of that. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the response I have received 
from the Department of Justice and 
the IRS be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

DEAR SENATOR GRASSLEY: This responds to 
your letter to the Attorney General and the 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) dated June 6, 2021, urging the in-
vestigation and prosecution of the disclosure 
of confidential taxpayer information as re-
ported in the media. We are sending iden-
tical responses to the other Senators who 
joined in your letter. We appreciate knowing 
of your concerns about this matter. 
As you may be aware, the Secretary of the 
Treasury testified recently that the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) is looking into the 
matter as is the Treasury Inspector General 
for Tax Administration (TIGTA). She further 
stated that the matter had been referred to 
the Treasury Inspector General, as well as 
the Department of Justice. 
The Department is committed to taking 
investigative steps as appropriately predi-
cated and authorized, carefully reviewing re-
ferrals we receive, and, as appropriate, con-
sidering relevant and admissible evidence in 
light of the Principles of Federal Prosecu-
tion. See Justice Manual 9–27.000. While we 
understand how important this issue is to 
you, longstanding Department policy will 
preclude us from providing your office with 
any information related to this matter out-
side the public record. 
We hope this information is helpful. Please 
do not hesitate to contact this office if we 
may provide additional assistance regarding 
this or any other matter.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I call 
on Attorney General Garland, FBI Di-
rector Wray, and Commissioner Rettig 
to take the apparent leak or hack of 
taxpayers’ information very seriously 
and 
cooperate 
with 
our 
constitu-
tionally mandated responsibility to 
conduct oversight to see that the laws 
are faithfully executed. 
The protection of taxpayers’ informa-
tion provided to the IRS is of critical 
importance to the basic functioning of 
government. Determining the source of 
the 
information 
published 
by 
ProPublica should be a top priority for 
our Nation’s tax enforcement Agency 
and, allegedly, premier law enforce-
ment entity. I intend to continue 
working with Ranking Member CRAPO 
of the Finance Committee and anybody 
else to continue looking into this mat-
ter. I hope that we are able to resolve 
how any confidential taxpayer infor-
mation was obtained from the IRS and 
those responsible are held accountable. 
TAXES 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
President 
Biden 
and 
congressional 
Democrats have repeatedly pledged not 
to raise taxes on anyone earning under 
$400,000. They have said it so many 
times that it has begun to sound like a 
broken record. The thing is, when 
someone feels the need to repeat a 
claim over and over, it is likely that 
they are trying to pull the wool over 
our eyes. That is exactly the case with 
the Democrats’ tax pledge. 
According to an analysis by the non-
partisan Joint Committee on Taxation, 
there isn’t a single income group com-
pletely spared from the Democrats’ tax 
hikes. In other words, it is going to hit 
a lot of people with incomes below 
$400,000 a year. 
And I know my colleagues know 
what the Joint Committee on Taxation 
is. It is an expert group that studies 
the Tax Code and the impact of tax 
changes. But, for the public at large, 
this is a nonpartisan group of people 
that do a very fine job of saying how 
changes in the Tax Code will affect 
whomever they are supposed to affect. 
Not those making under $400,000, not 
those making under $100,000, and not 
even those making under $10,000 will be 
guaranteed not having their taxes in-
creased, as the President promised. 
So going back to the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation analysis, over 12 
percent of taxpayers with incomes be-
tween $50,000 and $100,000 would see a 
tax increase. Thirty-five percent of 
those earning between $100,000 and 
$200,000 would pay higher taxes. You 
can’t raise taxes on small businesses 
and other job creators—these entre-
preneurs—without hitting the middle 
class. 
Economic studies show that when 
you raise taxes on businesses, any-
where from 20 to 70 percent of that tax

increase falls on the workers. Now, the 
Joint Committee on Taxation assumes 
it is about 25 percent. Whatever doesn’t 
fall on the backs of workers falls on 
shareholders. And then you need to re-
member that when it falls on share-
holders, there are millions of middle- 
class Americans trying to accumulate 
a nest egg for retirement. 
So, yes, when you hike taxes on 
small business from a top rate of 37 
percent to over 46 percent—once in-
cluding 
the 
Democrats’ 
proposed 
surtaxes—you, President Biden, hit the 
middle class. When you increase taxes 
on corporations from 21 percent to 26.5 
percent—returning our corporate tax 
rate to one of the highest in the devel-
oped world once figuring in State taxes 
as well—you, President Biden, also hit 
the middle class. 
Yet, Democrats contend their pro-
posal includes tax cuts for the middle 
class. More accurately, they cut taxes 
for a chosen group of middle and lower 
income Americans and a select few 
millionaires. Unlike the 2017 tax law 
that was passed by a Republican Sen-
ate that cuts taxes for the vast major-
ity of the middle class, the Democrats’ 
tax-and-spending bill leaves most— 
over 70 percent—of the taxpayers with 
either a goose egg or a tax hike. 
The Democrats’ tax bill is about 
picking winners and losers; it is not 
about sound tax policy. If you don’t 
have the right family composition or 
spend your money how Democrats 
want, you don’t get a tax cut, but you 
may get a tax increase. On the other 
hand, if you are wealthy and on a wait-
ing list for a $69,000, all-electric, 2022 
SUV, you are in store for a $12,500 tax 
credit—financed in part on the backs of 
the middle class. Moreover, if you are a 
multibillion-dollar company with a 
preexisting commitment to go net zero 
emissions by 2040, you are in for a mul-
timillion-dollar 
tax 
windfall—once 
again, that tax windfall financed in 
part on the backs of the middle class. 
So I hope the American people won’t 
be fooled by my Democratic colleagues’ 
rhetoric. Their bill hikes taxes on mil-
lions of taxpayers, and their narrowly 
targeted tax cut leaves most out in the 
cold.

CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCIES AND 
STABLECOINS 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, the Fed-
eral Reserve Board of Governors will 
soon be releasing a discussion paper on 
a potential U.S. central bank digital 
currency. Additionally, the President’s 
Working Group on Financial Markets 
is expected to release a set of rec-
ommendations relating to the super-
vision of stablecoins in the coming 
weeks. I want to lay out my views on 
central bank digital currencies and 
stablecoins in advance of these coming 
discussions. 
Financial innovation has the poten-
tial to bring new prosperity to the next 
generation of Americans, reduce sys-
temic risk, and promote inclusion for 
many who are, unfortunately, at the 
periphery of our financial system. 
America’s leadership in global finan-
cial services is a heritage our country 
can rightly be proud of, but our coun-
try must not become complacent, be-
cause this leadership is a privilege, not 
a right. 
I am supportive of the Federal Re-
serve Board’s efforts to study how cen-
tral bank digital currency, or CBDC, 
may be appropriate in the United 
States. I want to lay out what I believe 
are the key tenets of a consumer-fo-
cused U.S. central bank digital cur-
rency, including factors such as legiti-
mate 
need, 
financial 
inclusion, 
programmability, privacy, and avoid-
ing systemic risk. My comments are 
only focused on a consumer-focused 
central bank digital currency, as an 
interbank or wholesale central bank 
digital currency is a different propo-
sition. 
The first principle is legitimate need. 
A serious value proposition must exist 
in order to move forward with a central 
bank digital currency, one that cannot 
be reliably met by private-sector inno-
vation. 
It is important to note that the U.S. 
dollar is already digitized; that is, it 
has been reduced to electronic form. 
Most Americans predominantly use an 
electronic means of banking every day, 
and interbank settlement also takes 
place 
through 
electronic 
channels. 
These payment rails are generally elec-
tronic commercial bank money, how-
ever. A CBDC would be central bank 
money, which represents a direct claim 
on the Federal Reserve System. 
So we must ask hard questions about 
whether there are other means of ac-
complishing the goals of a central bank 
digital currency and identify opportu-
nities, risks, and costs. 
The second is financial inclusion. 
About 5.4 percent of households in 
the United States did not have a bank 
account as of 2019, with a further 18.7- 
percent of the population being under-
banked. A CBDC should meaningfully 
reduce these statistics. A CBDC also 
has the potential to reduce the cost of 
payments for both depository institu-
tions and consumers by removing ex-
isting frictions in sending money. 
The programmability of a CBDC will 
also likely promote financial inclusion 
by giving consumers more control over 
their money, allowing those from dis-
advantaged backgrounds access to the 
latest technology features. This would 
allow consumers to automate the pay-
ment of bills, assist with monthly 
budgeting, reduce or eliminate over-
draft fees, and most importantly, allow 
hard-working Americans to receive 
their paychecks earlier. 
Some additional factors that must be 
considered as part of the inclusion are 
the reduction or elimination of min-
imum balance requirements, ease of ac-
cess to a CBDC, and convertibility into 
physical cash. 
Third 
is 
the 
concept 
of 
programmability. 
Money 
represents 
value, but it is not programmable 
today. 
Programmability, at its core, is the 
technological means to specify the 
automated behavior or control logic of 
money in a manner that is tied to the 
actual value itself. Programmability 
focuses 
on 
the 
characteristics 
of 
money, including the identity of the 
owner, the amount of money being 
transferred, and the conditions under 
which the outside world can interact 
with that money. 
A 
CBDC 
should 
contain 
robust 
programmability, allowing users to 
easily specify conditions with respect 
to that money, such as interest pay-
ments; payment versus payment, which 
is ‘‘I only pay you if you pay me’’; de-
livery versus payment, which is ‘‘I give 
you a security or a commodity only if 
you pay me’’; escrow, or preventing 
your child from buying ice cream ex-
cept on Fridays; and, of course, avoid-
ing overdraft fees. 
A central bank digital currency 
should also be future-proofed, with a 
core code that can be adapted to fully 
meet future demands and which also 
contains room for value-added services 
built upon the CBDC architecture. 
Fourth is the critical role of privacy. 
A CBDC must have the same level of 
privacy as physical cash today. Appro-
priate transactional anonymity is a 
public good. Americans must have con-
fidence that a central bank digital cur-
rency is not being used for surveillance 
and that their personal financial data 
is either not being collected or is sub-
ject to rigorous technological and legal 
controls, including the Fourth Amend-
ment to the U.S. Constitution. We can-
not 
allow 
a 
CBDC 
to 
become 
a 
panopticon, or an all-seeing eye, as will 
soon be the case with China’s central 
bank digital currency. 
Fifth is avoiding systemic risk and 
disruption. A CBDC should not create 
systemic risk or undue disruption to 
the U.S. economy. Transitional ar-
rangements for a CBDC may be nec-
essary, and physical cash must remain 
legal tender as long as Americans de-
sire it, with Congress’s having the final 
say on the future of physical cash. 
These are the five principles that I 
consider essential to any central bank 
digital currency proposal. Congress 
must have the ultimate say on whether 
the United States adopts a central 
bank digital currency. I encourage my 
colleagues to think deeply about these 
issues and to develop their own rubric 
for the future of money. 
Finally, I want to say a few words 
about stablecoins in advance of the 
President’s working group report that 
will be coming out shortly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6758 
September 29, 2021 
Stablecoins are a claim on commer-
cial bank money or Treasurys or other 
securities that are freely tradeable on 
a distributed ledger or blockchain and 
that are intended to be redeemable at 
par for the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins are 
highly liquid and have higher mone-
tary velocity than other forms of the 
U.S. dollar. Stablecoins also enable 
faster payments between individuals 
and businesses than are possible today. 
For these reasons, stablecoins are a 
very important private-sector innova-
tion that have the potential to pro-
mote financial inclusion and new mar-
ket 
opportunities. 
However, 
stablecoins also present certain novel 
risks to the U.S. economy. 
In particular, stablecoins must be 100 
percent backed by cash and cash 
equivalents, and this should be audited 
regularly. 
I am concerned that some stablecoins 
are not always fully backed by appro-
priate assets in a transparent manner. 
I 
am 
also 
concerned 
that 
some 
stablecoin designs could become a silo 
for high-quality liquid assets, including 
Treasurys, which have an important 
and independent role as collateral in 
capital markets. 
Additionally, 
stablecoin 
issuers 
should comply with anti-money laun-
dering and sanctions law and should 
exhibit a high degree of resiliency. 
This includes operational risk, cyberse-
curity and liquidity, and redemption 
management, consistent with the Fed-
eral Reserve’s payment system risk 
policy. 
Some 
issuers 
of 
stablecoins 
and 
stablecoin-like instruments, including 
Paxos and Avanti Bank and Trust, are 
already inside the regulatory param-
eter. Properly supervised, stablecoins 
are not tantamount to the so-called 
‘‘wildcat banks’’ of the 19th century. It 
may be the case that stablecoins 
should only be issued by depository in-
stitutions or through money market 
funds or similar vehicles. 
We 
must 
do 
more 
to 
ensure 
stablecoins are subject to right-sized 
regulations and supervision. But, at 
the same time, we must ensure that 
these rules enable innovation that can 
make payments faster, cheaper, and 
more inclusive. Properly supervised, 
stablecoins have an important role to 
play moving forward. 
I look forward to continuing the con-
versation around financial innovation 
that we began a few months ago as we 
consider the future of money in our 
country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
ENERGY 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, the dif-
ference between medicine and poli-
tics—because I am a doctor—is that in 
medicine, you are forced to look at re-
ality as reality is, whereas in politics 
we can make up reality. It is: Oh, my 
gosh, I want it to be this way; so let’s 
assume that it is. 
I think it is a time for, at least—one, 
I think it is always better to look at 
reality, but, particularly right now, 
let’s talk about it as regards inflation. 
Inflation is really hurting middle-in-
come families. We are seeing higher 
prices in the grocery store, electricity 
bills, at the gasoline pump eating up 
their budgets. 
President Biden has repeatedly said 
he would not raise taxes on those mak-
ing less than $400,000 a year, but rising 
inflation as a result of his harmful eco-
nomic and energy agenda is effectively 
a tax. 
This is predictable. Democrats and 
left-of-center economists like Larry 
Summers warned about the risk of in-
flation and predicted a sharp rise in 
prices. He sounded the alarm at the $1.9 
trillion American Rescue Plan. He said 
that could overheat the economy. It 
did. 
This summer, used car prices were up 
45 percent, gasoline 45 percent, whole 
milk 7.5 percent. American families are 
paying higher prices for goods and 
services that are essential, and it con-
tinues to go higher. The U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor reported that consumer 
prices in June increased 5.4 percent rel-
ative to a year ago—the largest in-
crease since August 2008, more than 
double the target rate of 2 percent the 
Federal Reserve establishes. 
Now, President Biden and his admin-
istration, his Treasury Department, 
have reassured that this inflation is 
transitory or temporary. 
Just last week, the Wall Street Jour-
nal reported that the Federal Reserve 
sees inflation ‘‘lasting quite a while,’’ 
given their recent and upcoming ac-
tions—so, if you will, belying the reas-
surances of the administration. 
Looking particularly at energy, it is 
not surprising that electricity and gas-
oline prices are soaring, and the aver-
age price of gas has now gone over $3 a 
gallon since May. The national average 
is $3.19, $1 more per gallon than a year 
ago—now, again, predictable. 
One of the first things President 
Biden did when he took office was to 
cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline, kill-
ing 11,000 jobs that went with it—by 
the way, not jobs for bureaucrats in 
Washington, DC, doing quite well dur-
ing the pandemic because they con-
tinue to get paid, but jobs for construc-
tion workers who, if they don’t have 
this job, don’t have another job and 
have less ability to take care of their 
family and to better provide for their 
child’s future. 
He stopped domestic oil and gas 
leases and only does that which the 
court tells him he has to do. 
Oddly, since he did all of this in the 
name of addressing issues of carbon 
emission, the administration then re-
moved sanctions so that Russia can 
complete the construction of the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline, going from Russia to 
Germany, and now is asking OPEC, 
which includes Iran, Venezuela, Saudi 
Arabia, to increase oil production so 
we can import their oil—so much for 
the energy independence our country, 
researchers, and companies worked so 
hard to develop. 
And now we see with every draft of 
the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spend 
bill that the Democratic Party seems 
intent on driving prices higher, in-
creasing our energy dependence on 
other countries, and hurting our do-
mestic workforce. And I think, if we 
are going to go back to reality, the 
American people would ask not to de-
scribe these actions as being done for 
the good of the environment or the cli-
mate. I totally believe we must address 
climate, but the stark truth is that 
President 
Biden’s 
energy 
policies 
prioritize shutting down domestic pro-
duction and domestic jobs in favor of 
using dirtier Russian gas. 
Why do I say dirtier? There is a Na-
tional Lab that recently reported of 
natural gas produced in Louisiana and 
exported to Europe compared to gas 
coming to Europe from Russia, that 
over the 20-year horizon the carbon in-
tensity is 43 percent less for gas that 
comes from the United States to Eu-
rope than from Russian gas coming to 
Europe, and 10 percent less over 100 
years. 
If you really cared about lowering 
greenhouse gas emissions, creating jobs 
for the American worker, and strength-
ening our economy and our national se-
curity, you would encourage the pro-
duction of U.S. natural gas and ship it 
around 
the 
world, 
displacing 
that 
which was coming from countries such 
as Russia. 
It seems as if the administration is 
more interested in virtue-signaling 
than truly pursuing a low-carbon solu-
tion, and I would love for someone to 
explain why the administration is so 
hell-bent on shutting down energy pro-
duction in the United States, with the 
good-paying jobs and the economic op-
portunity, especially in Louisiana but 
not only in Louisiana. And it is done in 
a 
cleaner, 
more 
environmentally 
friendly way than in almost every 
other part of the Nation. It is as if they 
would rather the United States be de-
pendent on foreign sources, those that 
are often not allies, than to produce 
energy cleanly, creating American jobs 
in the United States of America. 
The United States is a global leader 
in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions 
entirely, almost, because of the in-
creased production of U.S. natural gas. 
As production increased and prices 
fell, natural gas replaced coal, so that 
now, off the top of my head, I think I 
know that, in absolute amounts, green-
house gas emissions in the United 
States are less now than they were in 
2004. And if not, they are almost there. 
Our economy is a lot bigger, and we 
have a lot more people, and yet we 
have managed to hold greenhouse gas 
emissions at a declining rate because 
we produced natural gas. 
We need to encourage exploration 
and production in our country. We 
should not be shutting it down, and we 
should not be shutting down the good 
jobs that go with it. The administra-
tion’s backward and disastrous energy 
policy is playing out before our eyes. It

is not good—destroying American jobs, 
contributing to inflation, and strength-
ening the geopolitical position of our 
geopolitical rivals. The administra-
tion’s actions are directly leading to 
higher gas and utility prices. 
There is a way out of the inflation, 
but it is not empty virtue-signaling. It 
is not putting American workers out of 
jobs. It is to restart American energy 
production, hold lease sales in the Gulf 
of Mexico, and get American energy in 
our country back on track, recreating 
the jobs that have been destroyed, and, 
by the way, increasing a greater ability 
to export to other countries around the 
world, helping to lower global green-
house gas emissions. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SOCIAL MEDIA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, by 
now we are all very familiar with the 
toll that COVID–19 has taken on the 
American people. If there is cause for 
encouragement coming from all of this, 
it is that our collective experience has 
helped to destigmatize mental health 
problems. 
The down side is that now we tend to 
look at everything through the lens of 
the pandemic. But the fact of the mat-
ter is that for millions of Americans, 
their 
private 
battles 
with 
mental 
health began well before March of 2020. 
It is from that perspective that I 
want to examine the Wall Street Jour-
nal’s truly excellent ongoing investiga-
tion into Facebook’s refusal to address 
the serious, and at times threatening, 
failings of their platforms. 
On September 14, the Journal pub-
lished 
an 
article 
revealing 
that 
Facebook, Inc., executives know that 
their popular Instagram photo-sharing 
program is toxic—toxic—especially for 
young women and girls. 
They know for a fact that 32 percent 
of teen girls said that, when they felt 
bad about their bodies, Instagram 
made them feel even worse. 
They knew that Instagram makes 
body image issues worse for one in 
three girls. They knew that teens 
blame Instagram for increases in the 
rate of anxiety and depression. How did 
they know all of this? Because they, 
Facebook, had done their own research. 
In 2019 and 2020, Facebook’s in-house 
analysts performed a series of deep 
dives into teen use of Instagram that 
reveals that ‘‘aspects of Instagram ex-
acerbate each other to create a perfect 
storm.’’ This is their awareness. That 
‘‘perfect storm’’ that they mention 
manifests itself in the minds of teen-
agers in the form of intense social pres-
sure, addiction, body image issues, eat-
ing disorders, anxiety, depression, and 
suicidal thoughts. This multibillion- 
dollar company is dragging their young 
users to Hell, and they are doing it on 
behalf of a fantasy. 
Much of the problem has to do with 
the fact that, by its very nature, 
Instagram forces its users to confront 
the unattainable. Facebook’s research-
ers found that young users who spend 
their day scrolling past filtered faces 
and lavish lifestyles can spiral into a 
so-called ‘‘social comparison journey’’ 
that mimics the grief cycle. Sixty- 
eight percent of teen girls and 40 per-
cent of boys experience this when they 
use Instagram. This is their research— 
their research. Sixty-eight percent of 
teen girls and 40 percent of teen boys 
experience that grief cycle. 
Yes. Heartbreaking, infuriating, and 
guess what—it gets even worse. The in-
ternal 
research 
also 
shows 
that 
Facebook execs at the highest levels 
were in on the scheme to use these 
traumatized young users to pull mem-
bers 
of 
their 
households 
into 
Instagram. Younger family members 
were of particular interest. 
This reporting is sunshine on a par-
ticularly 
disgusting 
aspect 
of 
Facebook’s strategy to shape the world 
in their image. 
Facebook often touts their compli-
ance with COPPA and other child pro-
tection standards as proof of their com-
mitment to online safety. Oh, but if it 
were only so. But the Wall Street Jour-
nal reports show that Facebook has ac-
tual knowledge that they are col-
lecting personal information online 
from kids under 13 years of age. These 
are children. They are suffering. But in 
the eyes of Facebook, they are the 
product. They are the product. They 
are the product that Facebook is using 
to get data so that they make more 
money. It is sickening. 
All of this and more was revealed to 
me and my staff by a very brave and 
well-informed 
whistleblower 
from 
within Facebook. I have been working 
closely with my colleague Senator 
BLUMENTHAL to bring this information 
to light, and I thank him and his staff 
for being excellent advocates on behalf 
of young people and teenagers. 
On October 5, Senator BLUMENTHAL— 
Chairman BLUMENTHAL—and I will host 
a hearing in the Commerce Consumer 
Protection, Product Safety, and Data 
Security 
Subcommittee 
where 
the 
whistleblower will offer an insider ac-
count of Facebook’s total lack of gov-
ernance and the growth-focused tunnel 
vision that has caused the company’s 
leadership to ignore everything they 
know about the real world. 
At this point, I want to emphasize a 
few important points we can extrapo-
late from what we know thus far. 
Facebook’s 
internal 
research 
re-
vealed at the very least a strong cor-
relation between use of their platforms 
and some forms of deteriorating men-
tal health in kids and teens. But here 
is the larger issue: Even if Facebook 
didn’t find proof of a causal link, it is 
unreasonable to assume that a com-
pany 
as 
large 
and 
successful 
as 
Facebook would ignore the social envi-
ronment in which their young users 
live and scroll. 
If you accept this general assertion, 
which I hold is reasonable, then you 
must 
also 
accept 
that 
Mark 
Zuckerberg and the rest of Facebook’s 
top executives were very well aware of 
the real-world context behind all of 
that research, and the context will 
make you sick. 
Between 2009 and 2019, the percentage 
of high school students who experi-
enced ‘‘persistent feelings of sadness or 
hopelessness’’ increased by more than 
10 percent. The percentage of high 
school students who seriously consid-
ered attempting suicide increased by 5 
percent. Numbers regarding suicide 
plans and suicide attempts also trended 
in the wrong direction. And even less 
severe mental health crises can lead to 
risky sexual behavior, drug use, tru-
ancy, delinquency. 
This is all no secret. It is publicly 
available information compiled by the 
CDC, accessible by anyone capable of 
executing a Google search. 
It is getting harder for our kids and 
grandkids to make it through the day. 
They haven’t even had a chance to live 
yet, and already they are experiencing 
hopelessness and despair. They feel so 
terribly about themselves that they 
would rather die than live another day. 
Facebook has evidence that their 
platform 
facilitates 
these 
mental 
health spirals for young users. Yet they 
focused on how to trick them into 
thinking that scrolling through con-
tent that makes them miserable is 
somehow healthy and normal behavior. 
Our children are not all right, and I 
am willing to state for the record that 
the people pushing success buttons at 
Facebook—they really do not care. 
On September 21, the New York 
Times published an expose on the com-
pany’s frankly shocking efforts to re-
habilitate its image by promoting pro- 
Facebook content into user news feeds. 
By all accounts, this reporting backed 
the company into a corner. They were 
caught redhanded manipulating the 
flow of information, which is a charge 
that in other contexts has drawn fire 
from activists, politicians, and even 
Facebook itself. 
In response to the well-earned back-
lash that Facebook received, Mark 
Zuckerberg chose to avoid account-
ability and instead made a joke about 
an anecdote the Times reporters in-
cluded regarding a video he had posted 
of himself cruising around on a glori-
fied surfboard. That is the sort of reac-
tion you see from a person who feels 
that they are invincible. When they 
feel like they are so rich and powerful 
and so totally in control of their own 
destiny that they are the master of the 
universe, that no one can touch them, 
that is what you get. 
In light of all we have seen in the 
past from this company and all that we 
have learned so far from the whistle-
blower, I think it is time to adjust Mr.

Zuckerberg’s 
thinking. 
Account-
ability—yes, indeed. There is bipar-
tisan agreement that it is time for ac-
countability to come, and I sincerely 
hope that Mr. Zuckerberg and the rest 
of his Facebook colleagues are pre-
pared for what is coming. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
ABORTION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this 
morning, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee had a hearing to discuss two of 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues’ 
biggest 
headaches: the Supreme Court of the 
United States and State laws that pro-
tect the right to life. 
This wasn’t the first time we have 
seen an attack on both waged by Mem-
bers of the Senate. Last year, the ma-
jority leader, Senator SCHUMER, walked 
across the street to the Supreme Court 
and threatened two Supreme Court 
Justices by name based on an abortion 
case that they were considering. 
Sadly, it seems that our Democratic 
colleagues have simply given up when 
it comes to protecting innocent life. In 
2020, February 2020, the Senate voted 
on a bill that would outlaw elective 
abortions after 20 weeks, when science 
tells us that a fetus can actually feel 
pain. Had this bill become law, it would 
have put U.S. domestic policy in line 
with that of most of the rest of the 
world. 
Unfortunately, we happen to be in a 
small category, including North Korea 
and communist China, when it comes 
to the ability to get an abortion well 
into the period of gestation, including 
up to late-term abortions. As it stands 
today, the United States is currently 
one of only seven countries to allow 
elective abortions after 20 weeks. As I 
said, those seven countries include the 
Communist Party China and North 
Korea. But our Democratic colleagues 
filibustered that bill too. 
Then came one more opportunity to 
protect the most vulnerable among us. 
The Senate voted on legislation requir-
ing doctors to provide lifesaving care 
to infants who survive abortions, just 
like any other newborn child would re-
ceive. That sounds like common sense, 
right? Well, if you ask the American 
people, they say yes. More than three- 
quarters of the American people, when 
it comes to polling, said they support 
providing medical treatment for babies 
who survive abortions. But there are 
no Federal laws requiring healthcare 
providers to care for these children just 
as they would any other infant in their 
care. And, yes, you guessed it—Demo-
crats blocked that bill too. 
The attack on innocent life has been 
years in the making, but we have never 
seen anything quite like the latest en-
deavor that has come from the House 
of Representatives. The so-called Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act is actually 
‘‘NANCY PELOSI’s Abortion Protection 
Act.’’ 
This isn’t just about messaging. The 
Senate version of the bill is cospon-
sored by all but two of our Democratic 
colleagues. Clearly, the provisions in-
cluded in this bill don’t represent the 
beliefs of just some small subset of the 
Democratic Party. Apparently, it is 
mainstream within the Democratic 
Party. 
But it is clear that this is a no-holds- 
barred attack on the right to life. One 
of the most outrageous and unprece-
dented aspects of the bill is it limits 
State laws limiting abortion even after 
viability. This goes far beyond where 
the Supreme Court went in Roe v. 
Wade. It also undermines another land-
mark abortion case, Planned Parent-
hood v. Casey. In Casey, the Supreme 
Court abandoned the trimester frame-
work of Roe, replacing it with a viabil-
ity standard to determine a State law’s 
constitutionality. Even the author of 
Roe v. Wade and of Casey agreed that 
this viability standard was largely ar-
bitrary. But this decision came in 1992, 
when a baby was considered viable 
after 23 or 24 weeks. But the marvels of 
modern medicine continue to challenge 
this estimate. Last June, a baby was 
born at 21 weeks and 2 days, and this 
past summer, he celebrated his first 
birthday. 
The extreme legislation attacking 
the right to life coming out of the 
House and now embraced by Senate 
Democrats would undercut the Su-
preme Court’s ruling in Casey v. 
Planned Parenthood and would invali-
date State laws that limit abortions 
after 20 weeks, which is now the con-
sensus period of viability. 
A number of States have passed laws 
to restrict access for different gesta-
tional periods—for example, in Massa-
chusetts and Nevada, for example, 
abortions are restricted after 24 weeks. 
In California, Washington, and Illi-
nois—they are among the many States 
that restrict abortions after viability. 
But the Democratic proposal is so ex-
treme, it would invalidate the laws 
passed in each of these blue States. 
If this proposal, the Pelosi abortion 
bill, 
became 
law, 
it 
would 
allow 
healthcare providers to perform abor-
tions at any point so long as it is done 
to preserve the mother’s health. This 
actually undermines the decision of the 
Supreme Court of the United States 
that said it is constitutional to limit 
so-called partial birth abortions as a 
barbaric practice that does not have 
constitutional protection. 
But the provision that would allow 
abortion at any point in the pregnancy 
so long as it is done to preserve the 
mother’s health—that doesn’t mean 
the pregnancy actually threatens the 
life of the mother. Let’s be clear on 
that point. If a single healthcare pro-
vider determines that the birth of the 
baby would impact on the mother’s 
mental health, an abortion would be 
legal at any point in the pregnancy up 
to birth. 
This is way out of step with where 
most Americans are. A poll this last 
summer found that 65 percent of Amer-
icans believe that abortion should be 
illegal during the second trimester, the 
second 3-month period of pregnancy. 
An abortion opposition, I should say, 
to a third-trimester abortion is even 
stronger. These are the so-called late- 
term abortions where the fetus is fully 
formed and even viable outside of the 
mother’s womb. Eighty percent of 
Americans oppose third-trimester abor-
tions but not Pelosi’s abortion act, em-
braced by all but two of the Democrats 
here in the U.S. Senate. 
The American people clearly do not 
want abortion laws that put us in the 
same 
league 
as 
China 
and 
North 
Korea—two of the world’s most aggres-
sive human rights abusers. Until 2016, 
China had a strict one-child policy. 
Families who didn’t comply with that 
policy could be fined, lose their jobs, 
and the baby would even be the subject 
of a forced abortion. And it became 
common in China, as a result of this 
limitation on pregnancy, for families 
to prefer a son and undergo gender-se-
lection abortions. If you are pregnant 
with a female child, well, abortion is 
fair game because they preferred to use 
abortion as a means to select the gen-
der of their child. 
Democrats’ legislation doesn’t sim-
ply remain silent on gender-selective 
abortions; it goes so far as to prohibit 
States from outlawing abortion as a 
method of gender selection. Not only 
that, it undermines State efforts to 
protect unborn babies with disabilities 
or Down syndrome. Unborn children 
being killed solely on gender or disabil-
ities is a devastating problem in other 
countries. We cannot allow such a gro-
tesque practice to become mainstream 
here in the United States. We are bet-
ter than that. 
The list of atrocities included in this 
legislation is a long one. It requires 
healthcare providers who hold deep re-
ligious objections to abortion to vio-
late their own deeply held religious be-
liefs and kill unborn babies. It invali-
dates informed consent laws, which re-
quire healthcare providers to share ac-
curate information with their patient 
about the baby and whether specifi-
cally the child can feel pain. It gives 
the Attorney General of the United 
States sweeping authority to block 
State laws that try to protect innocent 
human life. So this radical proposal 
from the House, now embraced by all 
but two of our Senate Democrats, 
would overturn existing State laws and 
allow abortions on a scale our country 
has never seen before. 
I think it is a sad commentary on the 
conscience of America when all but a 
handful of our Democratic colleagues 
are fighting to implement these radical 
policies. But we cannot and we will not 
stay silent at a time when our most 
vulnerable are being attacked in such a 
manner. We have a moral imperative 
to defend those who cannot defend 
themselves, born or unborn, to protect 
those who cannot protect themselves. 
Babies with heartbeats, fingerprints, 
taste buds—they deserve to have pro-
tection of the law too. The Declaration

of Independence, after all, says that we 
hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all are endowed by their Creator 
with certain unalienable rights, includ-
ing the right to life. I have always been 
proud to defend that right, and at no 
time in my lifetime has it ever needed 
more defense than right now in the 
face of these outrageous proposals. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier 
today, as we just heard from my col-
league from Texas, the Judiciary Com-
mittee held a hearing on the abortion 
ban that took effect in the State of 
Texas earlier this month. I hope every 
American who tuned in to this hearing 
listened very closely—very closely—be-
cause here is what we heard: 
My Republican colleagues on the 
committee literally made no effort to 
defend the Texas abortion law, the 
Texas abortion ban—SB 8, as it is 
known in Texas—not a single effort to 
defend it on its merits. They made no 
effort to engage on the issue of the 
shadow docket process through which 
the Supreme Court allowed this bill to 
become law, and they made no effort to 
argue 
that 
women’s 
constitutional 
rights should be protected. 
What we witnessed during today’s 
hearing was the opening salvo on the 
fate and future of Roe v. Wade. Here 
are the facts: 
This Texas law is no ordinary piece 
of legislation. To quote Supreme Court 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, it is ‘‘a fla-
grantly 
unconstitutional 
law 
engi-
neered to prohibit women from exer-
cising their constitutional rights and 
evade judicial scrutiny.’’ 
This law has effectively banned abor-
tion after 6 weeks in the Nation’s sec-
ond largest State, even in cases of rape 
and incest. The fact is, many women do 
not even know they are pregnant by 6 
weeks. 
The architects behind SB 8 took an 
extreme proposal that clearly violated 
Supreme Court precedent and paired it 
with a new, disturbing private bounty 
hunter enforcement scheme, and they 
did so in the hope that the courts 
would not block the law because it 
wasn’t clear who should be sued. 
At midnight on September 1, the Su-
preme Court allowed SB 8 to go into ef-
fect. As a result, millions of Texas 
women have had their constitutional 
rights challenged and suspended. 
This attack on women has already 
caused irreparable harm to countless 
women who lost their right to repro-
ductive care in Texas. 
At today’s hearing, we heard from 
Donna Howard, a State representative 
from Texas. In her written testimony, 
she shared the story of a woman who 
was denied the healthcare she was enti-
tled to under the Federal Constitution. 
The woman went in to an appointment 
on August 31 of this year, and at the 
time, there was no heartbeat detected 
on the State-mandated sonogram. But 
when she came back the next day to 
have the procedure done, a cardiac mo-
tion was detected. 
Representative Howard said of this 
woman that at only 5 weeks—5 weeks 
of pregnancy—she was too late to re-
ceive an abortion under the provisions 
of this new law. She was devastated. 
She already had a child at home and 
knew that bringing another child into 
their lives threatened her family’s situ-
ation and their financial security. 
As Representative Howard went on to 
note, having an abortion was ‘‘the 
right decision for this mother’s life and 
her family’s well-being.’’ 
But the Texas law went into effect, 
and the Supreme Court deprived this 
woman of her constitutional right. 
SB 8 marks a turning point in the 
decades-long campaign to undermine 
the Supreme Court’s holding in Roe v. 
Wade. For years, legislative efforts to 
ban previability abortion have been 
stopped by courts. Until now. 
The legal architects behind this 
Texas law crafted a scheme to avoid ju-
dicial review. They lifted the responsi-
bility of enforcement from the State 
and put it in the hands of private citi-
zens. Listen to this: As a result of this 
Texas law, they have turned ordinary 
citizens into bounty hunters. 
I want to clarify something. I have 
read it and asked the Texas State rep-
resentative to verify. It has been said 
that you can sue a person who aids and 
abets an abortion in Texas and recover 
$10,000 costs and attorney’s fees. That 
is not what the law said. The law says 
you can recover not less than $10,000 in 
costs and attorney’s fees. The first law-
suits have been filed already against 
doctors in these clinics, and they are 
seeking damages in the amount of 
$100,000 or more. 
You don’t even have to live in Texas 
to receive this bounty. Consider Dr. 
Alan Braid, the first person to be sued 
under this new Texas law. Earlier this 
month, Dr. Braid, a practicing OB–GYN 
in San Antonio, penned an op-ed in the 
Washington Post explaining why he is 
continuing to provide abortions despite 
the law. 
As someone who has worked in medi-
cine since 1972, the year before Roe v. 
Wade, Dr. Braid remembers a time 
when women could not safely access 
abortion care. He believes he has a 
‘‘duty of care’’ to his patients, and he 
refuses to ‘‘sit back and watch us re-
turn to 1972,’’ in the doctor’s own 
words. Well, as I mentioned, he is al-
ready facing the legal consequences of 
this new Texas law. 
Who is exactly the bounty hunter 
who filed the first lawsuit against him? 
You might guess it is a fellow Texan, 
right? You are wrong. It is a disbarred 
lawyer who lives in Arkansas, a bounty 
hunter; $100,000 is what he thinks this 
law is going to give him. 
That lawsuit being filed against Dr. 
Braid illustrates how irregular this 
Texas law’s bounty hunter enforcement 
model really is. Anyone from any State 
can file a lawsuit against any physi-
cian. But when we include the cat-
egories of people who aid and abet the 
person receiving the abortion, the cat-
egories go wide afield, from the people 
who gave her advice, the folks who 
gave the transportation to the clinic, 
the minister who counseled her—all of 
these things makes them eligible to be 
sued for a minimum of $10,000 now in 
Texas. 
There is a reason why the Texas leg-
islators designed the law this way. 
They sensed an opportunity on the Su-
preme Court. They knew an emergency 
legal challenge to this Texas law had a 
good chance of coming all the way to 
the Supreme Court. And they knew the 
Supreme Court has shown a willingness 
to allow sweeping changes to the law 
to take place on a short timetable 
without detailed explanation. 
It was interesting to listen to the Re-
publican Senators go into orbit over 
the fact that we would raise questions 
about the shadow docket. It is a mo-
tions docket where the Justices on the 
Supreme Court can decide an issue on a 
very short timeframe without even ex-
plaining their position. 
That is exactly what happened with 
SB 8. When the law came before the Su-
preme Court, a majority of Supreme 
Court Justices, late at night, allowed it 
to take effect. 
The next day, the Court issued a one- 
paragraph opinion to explain it. It said 
they would not stay Texas’s abortion 
ban because of the law’s ‘‘complex and 
novel’’ procedural questions. In other 
words, the Texas legislators got their 
way. By designing SB 8 with a new 
bounty 
hunter 
enforcement 
model, 
Texas lawmakers managed to evade ju-
dicial review. 
In her dissent, Justice Sotomayor ex-
plained how this scheme worked. She 
said, ‘‘The Court has rewarded the 
State’s effort to delay federal review of 
a plainly unconstitutional statute, en-
acted in disregard of the Court’s prece-
dents, through procedural entangle-
ments of the State’s own creation.’’ 
The Court’s ruling on SB 8 is dis-
tressing for a number of reasons. For 
one, 
it 
has 
galvanized 
lawmakers 
across the country to undermine con-
stitutional rights in their States. Over 
the past month, lawmakers and can-
didates in Arkansas, Florida, South 
Dakota, and other States have pledged 
to follow suit and copycat the Texas 
law. They saw what happened when 
this bill came before the Supreme 
Court. The Supreme Court basically 
said it can go forward. 
Additionally, the conservative ma-
jority on the Supreme Court has now 
signaled that it is willing to use the 
shadow docket to allow even laws un-
constitutional on their face to take ef-
fect, as long as it aligns with certain 
ideological norms. 
Another witness we heard from today 
was Professor Steve Vladeck, an expert 
in constitutional law who has written 
extensively about the Court’s shifting 
use of the shadow docket. 
The shadow docket, of course, refers 
to situations where the Court issues

decisions outside the traditional mer-
its docket. Historically, shadow docket 
orders are used to help resolve routine 
or 
procedural 
questions 
frequently 
without public deliberation, full brief-
ings, or even signed opinions. 
But as Professor Vladeck testified, 
there has been a notable uptick in the 
Supreme Court issuing shadow docket 
orders that are ‘‘having a far broader 
substantive 
impact, 
for 
better 
or 
worse, compared to [the] emergency 
rulings in the past.’’ And many of these 
shadow docket orders appear to be 
driven by ideology. 
Let me tell why I say that. Listen to 
these numbers. During the 4-year Pres-
idency of Donald Trump, the Supreme 
Court issued 28 grants of emergency re-
lief on the shadow docket at the re-
quest of the Trump administration—28 
grants of shadow docket relief out of 36 
requests. Each of these orders advanced 
President Trump’s political agenda, in-
cluding one that allowed the resump-
tion of Federal executions for the first 
time and in nearly two decades. 
Now, let’s do a comparison. If there 
were 36 requests of the Supreme Court 
for shadow docket opinions and 28 of 
them were granted in the 4 years of 
Donald Trump, how about previous 
Presidents? During the 16 years of the 
George W. Bush and Obama Presi-
dencies, from 2001 to 2017, the Supreme 
Court issued four—four—orders in 16 
years. In this last 4-year period of 
time, they granted 28 out of 36 with the 
Trump Justice Department. 
With its handling of Texas’s abortion 
ban, as well as other shadow docket or-
ders, the Supreme Court’s conservative 
majority has indicated a willingness to 
change substantive law in sweeping 
ways without due deliberation and pub-
lic reporting. 
In doing so, they are undermining 
confidence in the Court, and the con-
servative majority has opened the door 
for ideologically driven legal schemes 
to rewrite laws from the shadows, like 
SB 8. This is a five-alarm fire for due 
process, as well as our constitutional 
rights. 
And as I expressed during this to-
day’s hearing, I hope every Member of 
the Senate—Democrat or Republican— 
will join together to protect and pre-
serve independent, transparent, and 
reasoned 
judicial 
decision 
making 
based on the rule of law. 
At a time when the public’s con-
fidence in our governmental institu-
tions has been greatly eroded, we must 
restore it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2840 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise 
again today to express my objection to 
President Biden’s sweeping vaccine 
mandate and to offer legislation that 
would protect Americans from this 
Federal intrusion. 
As I said yesterday, the Federal Gov-
ernment has no business mandating 
COVID–19 vaccination for all Ameri-
cans. Unfortunately, at least some of 
my colleagues disagree. The President 
of the United States said, while an-
nouncing the mandate, ‘‘This isn’t 
about freedom or personal choice.’’ 
‘‘This isn’t about freedom or personal 
choice.’’ It stuns me to think that a 
sweeping Federal mandate could be 
about anything other than freedom or 
personal choice. It is like robbing a 
bank and then saying it is not about 
the money. 
Our Constitution was designed to 
protect the liberties of the people of 
the United States. But now, the gov-
ernment is being used by the Executive 
to force Americans to be vaccinated or 
to be terminated. 
Yesterday, I came to the floor to 
speak about those Americans with sin-
cerely held beliefs, whether religious or 
otherwise. My bill yesterday would 
have simply required that any mandate 
of this sort contain an exemption for 
those individuals. 
Now, I don’t believe that such an ex-
ception would be sufficient to resolve 
the constitutional and the policy prob-
lems with such a mandate. But there 
are millions of Americans who would 
be able to live according to their be-
liefs if, in fact, such an exemption were 
included by law, which it should be. 
Lamentably, my colleague the senior 
Senator from Washington objected. So 
I pledged to come back again today and 
tomorrow, for as long as it takes, to 
win the fight against this egregious 
mandate. 
Today, I am providing another oppor-
tunity for this body to protect Ameri-
cans. 
This mandate poses a real threat to 
the well-being of millions. Those who 
choose not to be vaccinated are at risk 
of losing their jobs. My office has been 
in contact with 144 Utahns who are 
concerned about this very issue. I 
shared some of their stories yesterday. 
Despite what many on the other side 
of this debate would have you believe, 
these are, in fact, everyday Americans: 
people with preexisting medical condi-
tions, 
like 
autoimmune 
disorders. 
These are people who are just wanting 
to provide for their families and not to 
be able to expect that. These are preg-
nant mothers who are concerned about 
the safety of their own health and that 
of their unborn children. 
Some of these people are the heroes 
of yesterday. They are first responders; 
they are medical professionals and es-
sential workers who sacrificed to carry 
our Nation through the hardest days of 
this pandemic. And they are still he-
roes today. These Americans are not 
the enemy. 
President Biden and those who sup-
port this effort are grasping for solu-
tions they believe can bolster their po-
litical position and shift blame on the 
status of the pandemic. Those paying 
the price are the people back home, in-
cluding many of the people I just de-
scribed. 
So today, I offer another proposal. 
This bill would provide those Ameri-
cans harmed by this mandate with a 
means of recourse. Under this bill, 
those who lose employment or lose 
their livelihoods due to this mandate 
may sue the United States for relief. 
The bill would make these very Ameri-
cans whole after the President of the 
United States made working impos-
sible for them. 
This bill is only one of many that I 
have introduced to combat this uncon-
stitutional, unwarranted, indefensible 
mandate. While I believe this mandate 
will 
eventually 
be 
invalidated 
in 
court—I am quite confident that it 
will—until that day comes, these bills 
can provide businesses and the Amer-
ican people with the certainty that 
they need to make their own decisions. 
We will be protecting their God-given 
and constitutionally protected right to 
make medical decisions for themselves. 
So, Madam President, I am here 
today and I will be back tomorrow and 
fighting against this mandate for as 
long as it takes. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Judiciary Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 2840, 
and that the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. Further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
more than 680,000 Americans have died 
from COVID. The majority of these 
deaths occurred before we had viable, 
effective, and safe vaccines. Doctors 
were begging for these vaccines to save 
lives, and now we have three safe, ef-
fective, widely available vaccines in 
America. All three have been proven 
successful and safe. 
However, one in four adults in Amer-
ica still refuses to get the vaccine. Ac-
cording to the CDC, these unvaccinated 
individuals—listen 
to 
this—are 
10 
times more likely to be hospitalized 
from COVID, 10 times more likely to 
die from COVID than those who got the 
shot. And as long as large numbers of 
Americans remain unvaccinated, this 
virus is going to continue to spread and 
raise the risk of mutation and more 
deadly variants. 
We 
have 
tried 
approaches 
to 
incentivize people. What more can we 
do? We created a lottery in Illinois and 
said: If you are vaccinated, you are 
automatically buying a lottery ticket; 
you don’t even have to pay for it. 
The head of the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons union for employees, with only 
50 percent of those working in Federal 
prisons vaccinated, said they were 
going to set up a popcorn machine at 
the prisons in the break room in the

hopes of getting people to be vac-
cinated—trying everything to get peo-
ple to try the vaccine. 
We have tried every approach to 
incentivize them, but the vaccine num-
bers are not where they need to be. So, 
facing this reality, the President ac-
cepted responsibility to try harder. He 
has directed Federal Agencies and 
OSHA to mandate vaccination for Fed-
eral employees and certain private 
workers. These directives were issued 
under the OSHA Act and other estab-
lished legal authorities; and, listen, 
they have been welcomed by the Busi-
ness Roundtable and other employers 
who were waiting for a signal from the 
White House that we were serious, and 
they are supported by a majority of the 
American people. 
I recognize that some of my col-
leagues disagree with that action, and 
that has prompted this bill from my 
friend and fellow Senator from Utah. 
His bill, the Don’t Jab Me Act, would 
create a private right of action for any 
‘‘aggrieved individual’’ to sue the Fed-
eral Government ‘‘for injuries sus-
tained as a result of a COVID–19 vac-
cination mandate.’’ 
I know that the Senator is careful in 
his words. I would ask him to look 
carefully at that word ‘‘injuries.’’ It is 
misleading. 
COVID–19 vaccines are safe and effec-
tive. They were evaluated in tens of 
thousands of clinical trials. They meet 
the FDA’s rigorous scientific standards 
for safety, effectiveness, and quality. 
They have undergone and will continue 
to undergo the most extensive, inten-
sive safety monitoring in history. 
In an extremely rare case that an in-
dividual suffers an injury, a harm, from 
a COVID–19 vaccine, there is a system 
in place to provide compensation. 
Under 
the 
Countermeasures 
Injury 
Compensation Program, a person can 
already seek to recover damages for 
physical injuries suffered because of 
COVID–19 vaccines. 
The Senator from Utah’s bill appears 
to go beyond compensating individuals 
for physical injuries caused by the vac-
cine. It lets people sue the government 
for ‘‘injuries sustained as the result of 
a COVID–19 vaccine mandate.’’ 
Now, what kind of injuries might 
there be? 
Well, we surely don’t know. The bill 
does not define the type of injuries 
that a person could sue for. The entire 
bill is two and a half pages of very 
vague language. 
What we do know is that the bill, if 
enacted, would authorize a flood of 
lawsuits by individuals claiming that a 
vaccine mandate injured them in some 
physical, maybe nonphysical way. We 
don’t know. 
It is ironic. For more than a year, my 
Republican colleagues claimed the pan-
demic would create a tsunami of 
COVID lawsuits. Remember all of the 
times Senator MCCONNELL went to the 
floor and said: Hang on tight. The trial 
lawyers are just going to be hell-bent 
now, filing lawsuits all across America. 
There will be a tsunami of lawsuits. 
Well, it never happened. Despite that 
fact, the Senator from Utah is appar-
ently urging a new set of lawsuits to be 
filed. 
I am a former trial lawyer. I made a 
living at it. When people have been 
harmed, I support their day in court, 
but liabilities laws need to be carefully 
calibrated to promote the right behav-
ior and incentives. This short, vague 
bill does not even try to strike a bal-
ance between health and safety. It is a 
shot across the bow to entities that are 
using vaccine mandates. 
Remember, courts have long rejected 
challenges to vaccine requirements im-
posed by public entities. And the Sen-
ator might take a look at his home 
State. In Senator LEE’s home State of 
Utah, there are public actors, like Salt 
Lake Community College, the Univer-
sity of Utah, and Utah State Univer-
sity, that are using COVID vaccine 
mandates to promote health and safe-
ty. 
And I want to show the Senate this 
chart because it tells an amazing story. 
Remember the report about all the 
attorneys general who were going to 
file lawsuits, in keeping with the Sen-
ator’s message, against Joe Biden for 
these mandates for these employees? 
Well, we took a look at their State. 
Twenty-four States threatened law-
suits against Joe Biden for the very 
reason stated by the Senator from 
Utah. 
How are they doing compared to all 
the other States, the 26 States that 
didn’t file a lawsuit? 
Well, it turns out the infection rate 
for COVID–19 over the past 3 months is 
more than twice in those States as it is 
in the States not filing these lawsuits. 
Since mid-June, the death rate is al-
most three times the rate of those 
States that didn’t file the lawsuit, and 
the vaccination rates are significantly 
lower. 
So for those who have an idea about 
guiding the State to the right outcome, 
shouldn’t public health and safety be 
important? 
I am sure we all understand the issue 
of liberty and how important it is to 
America, but there was a word before 
liberty that the Founding Fathers 
used: life. Life. 
These vaccine mandates are about 
saving lives in America, and it is for 
that reason that I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I appre-
ciate the insight provided by my friend 
and distinguished colleague, the senior 
Senator from Illinois and the assistant 
majority leader. 
I respectfully submit that this is 
about allowing people to obtain redress 
for, among other things, the awful Hob-
son’s choice people are facing and are 
increasingly going to be facing as this 
mandate kicks in. It hasn’t been issued 
yet. We still don’t know what is in it. 
We still don’t know his precise basis 
for the authority. We assume that he 
would have told us his precise basis for 
the authority if, in fact, it existed. 
I have scoured the U.S. Code looking 
for authority for the President of the 
United States to implement this uni-
laterally, and I have found none. So it 
is very significant, therefore, that 
when you are going to put this kind of 
a Hobson’s choice in front of the peo-
ple, you ought to be able to at least 
have the decency to tell them what 
your source of authority is. He still 
hasn’t done it. 
If we assume that he is going to come 
up with one and that he is going to 
issue a mandate, that mandate is going 
to put a whole lot of people in a ter-
rible position, forcing them to choose 
between getting a vaccine that, for 
whatever reason, they don’t want and 
termination—between submission and 
poverty. That is unfair. 
Now, look, I get the fact that a lot of 
us were and are enthusiastic and grate-
ful for the vaccine. I have received the 
vaccine, as has every member of my 
family. I think the vaccine is a good 
thing. I also understand that there are 
people who feel differently. In some 
cases, there are people who have been 
advised by board-certified medical doc-
tors not to get the vaccine based on the 
existence of one or more autoimmune 
diseases, past personal or family his-
tory, and their idiosyncratic reactions 
to other vaccines or to this vaccine. 
There are other people who might have 
religious or other sincerely held per-
sonal beliefs that might make this 
choice a really unfair one for the Fed-
eral Government to force upon them. 
So, yeah, I am glad we have got the 
vaccine. I think the vaccine is good. I 
think the vaccine is helping a lot of 
people. But to tell every American that 
he or she must get this under penalty 
of losing a job, and then for the Presi-
dent, after acknowledging that he 
doesn’t have authority, to mandate 
this for every American turns Amer-
ica’s employers—all those with more 
than 99 employees—into the COVID–19 
vaccine police for the entire country. 
It is unjustifiable, even at a policy 
level, before we get to the obvious con-
stitutional defects and the lack of any 
semblance of any statutory authority. 
So I am disappointed that we can’t 
pass this one today. I will be back 
again tomorrow. I will continue to 
come back for weeks to come because 
the American people deserve better 
than this. They deserve not to have 
people in Washington, DC, purporting 
to make very personal healthcare deci-
sions for them and conditioning their 
own 
private-sector 
employment 
on 
compliance with the dictate of one 
man in Washington, DC.

September 29, 2021 
nomination of Robert Anderson to 
serve as Solicitor of the Department of 
the Interior, and I am here to tell you, 
Madam President, that I oppose this 
nomination. 
Now, if confirmed, Mr. Anderson will 
serve as the Department’s chief attor-
ney and also as the principal legal ad-
viser to the Secretary of the Interior, 
Secretary Haaland. He would oversee 
more than 430 attorneys and a staff 
within 6 legal divisions. He would be 
responsible for ensuring that business 
conducted in the Interior Department 
follows the law and is done trans-
parently. He would be granted tremen-
dous powers to shape how the Depart-
ment fulfills its mission by issuing 
final legal interpretations on all mat-
ters within the jurisdiction of the De-
partment. 
These 
decisions 
directly 
impact 
homes and businesses in Wyoming and 
throughout the Nation. These decisions 
can make or break our Nation’s ability 
to protect our environment, to use and 
enjoy our natural resources, to create 
good-paying jobs, and to pay for serv-
ices such as public education. 
Over the course of his career, Mr. An-
derson has both taught and practiced 
law, primarily focused on Tribal issues. 
Now, I am concerned that Mr. Ander-
son lacks sufficient legal experience 
beyond the Tribal law to effectively 
navigate the complex web of issues 
governing the multiple use of public 
lands and Federal lands. 
I am very concerned about Mr. An-
derson’s actions, specifically actions he 
has taken as the Principal Deputy So-
licitor since January 20 of this year. He 
has revoked many solicitors’ opinions 
issued under the Trump administra-
tion. His work has paved the way for 
the Biden administration’s punishing 
policies that are in direct conflict with 
the Department of the Interior’s mul-
tiple-use mandate. 
Mr. Anderson’s responses to ques-
tioning by Senator CASSIDY during his 
nomination hearing were particularly 
concerning to me. Senator CASSIDY 
asked whether the nominee agreed that 
the requirement to ‘‘maintain’’—main-
tain—oil and gas leasing programs 
meant to lease some more—not just 
maintain the leases that were already 
leased, but continue leasing. Mr. An-
derson responded that he thought it 
was an open question. 
Madam President, to suggest that 
the Secretary is no longer required to 
plan for and hold new offshore oil and 
gas leases simply and unfortunately 
but truly ignores the law of the land. 
Let me be clear. The Secretary of the 
Interior is required to comply with the 
law like everyone else. Mr. Anderson’s 
willingness to put the Biden adminis-
tration’s war on American energy 
ahead of following established law, in 
my opinion, disqualifies him from serv-
ing as Solicitor. 
I will vote against Mr. Anderson’s 
nomination, and I will urge other Sen-
ators to do so. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Michigan. 
NOMINATON OF JONATHAN EUGENE MEYER 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise in support of Jonathan Meyer’s 
nomination to be general counsel of 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
or DHS. 
Mr. Meyer is an accomplished lawyer 
and dedicated public servant who is 
well qualified to serve as the Depart-
ment’s chief legal officer. His nomina-
tion maintains bipartisan support, in-
cluding from former DHS general coun-
sels who served under both Democratic 
and Republican administrations. 
Mr. Meyer’s previous government 
service spans 17 years and includes sen-
ior roles in the Department of Justice, 
the U.S. Senate, and as the deputy gen-
eral counsel for DHS during the Obama 
administration. 
Since returning to private practice in 
2016, Mr. Meyer’s legal work has con-
tinued to focus on cyber security, tech-
nology, 
and 
homeland 
security. 
Throughout the confirmation process, 
Mr. Meyer has demonstrated that he 
understands the complex legal issues 
facing DHS and the importance of en-
suring that the Department cooperates 
with Congressional oversight. 
DHS has not had a Senate-confirmed 
general counsel for over 2 years. DHS 
needs qualified, Senate-confirmed lead-
ers in place to effectively carry out its 
critical mission of safeguarding our 
Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to confirm Mr. 
Meyer today. 
I yield the floor.

ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing rule XXII, all postcloture 
time on executive Calendar Nos. 264 
and 159 be considered expired at 4:45

confirmation of the Meyer nomination 
occur at a time to be determined by 
the majority leader, following con-
sultation with the Republican leader 
on Thursday, September 30. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The senior Senator from Oregon. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in a 
few minutes, I will put forward the 
unanimous consent request that the 
Senate take up and approve a highly 
qualified 
and 
unquestionably 
non-
controversial nominee. I am going to 
take just a few minutes to talk about 
Jonathan Davidson, nominated to be 
the next Deputy Under Secretary for 
Legislative Affairs at the Treasury De-
partment. 
To do this briefly, there are a few 
key points to make about this impor-
tant nomination. To start, Jon isn’t 
just a person off the street being nomi-
nated for a new job in the Biden admin-
istration. In fact, my guess is, vir-
tually every Member of this body, 
Democrats and Republicans alike, have 
worked with Jon at one point or an-
other. 
From 2011 until he was nominated 
this past spring, Jon served as chief of 
staff to another Finance Committee 
colleague, 
Senator 
BENNET. 
He 
is 
known as somebody who is honest, who 
is hardworking, and who is committed, 
most importantly, to bringing people 
together to tackle big challenges, and 
he has been doing it a long time. 
Before his work with Senator BEN-
NET, Jon served as chief of staff to Sen-
ator Paul Sarbanes. He spent time in 
the office of Representative JOHN SAR-
BANES, and he was later chief counsel 
to our friend and colleague, Senator 
MARK WARNER. You don’t have to take 
it from me that Jon knows his way 
around the Congress. All of those Mem-
bers trusted Jon as a right-hand man. 
The second issue: I can’t find any 
controversy with respect to his nomi-
nation. He cleared the Senate’s Fi-
nance Committee on a 28-to-0 vote. 
Let me repeat that: 28-to-0 vote. 
In fact, the Finance Committee re-
ported out several nominees this Con-
gress without any Republican opposi-
tion, none at all. Normally, that would 
be enough to pave the way for prompt 
and full Senate consideration, but I 
think we all understand these are not 
normal times here in the U.S. Senate. 
It used to be the case, at the end of 
July, the two sides would come to-
gether and look to pass a package of 
noncontroversial nominees by unani-
mous consent. My Finance Committee 
team thought this would be the case 
this year. Unfortunately, that did not 
take place. Senate Republicans were 
just in no mood to clear even the most 
uncontroversial nominees. 
This is an extraordinary level of ob-
struction beyond what you saw when 
the previous administration was staff-
ing up. For example, let’s take the pre-
vious two nominees for the same posi-
tion Jon is up for. 
Drew Maloney was the first Trump 
nominee for Legislative Affairs at 
Treasury. The Finance Committee held 
a hearing on this nomination on June 
7, 2017. The committee voted on his 
nomination a week later, favorably re-
ported by a vote of 25 to 1. A few weeks 
after that, the full Senate passed his 
nomination by unanimous consent, 
along with several other nominations 
for roles in the Trump Treasury De-
partment. That is how the process gen-
erally unfolds. 
Two years later, Brian McGuire was 
nominated to replace Mr. Maloney. His 
hearing was held July 24, 2019. The Fi-
nance Committee approved his nomina-
tion a week later. He was confirmed to 
serve in the Trump administration on 
September 24. 
In both cases, these two nominees, 
colleagues, were confirmed 2 months 
after their hearings. 
Jon Davidson has been waiting 4 
months since his hearing on May 25— 
nearly twice as long as Trump nomi-
nees waited for the same job. 
I think we all understand that it is 
essential to have qualified individuals 
heading up offices of Legislative Af-
fairs. They help to make sure adminis-
trations follow the laws, just as the 
Senate passes as intended. They help 
Members write legislation. They make 
sure that all Members get responses to 
their questions with respect to over-
sight. 
Setting everything else aside, you 
would think Senate Republicans would 
be especially interested now in making 
sure the Senate can perform that es-
sential oversight. I myself am looking 
for some straight answers to a number 
of oversight requests I had posed to the 
Treasury Department, and having Jon 
installed in his new role as Treasury 
would sure help to move that process 
along. Federal Agencies and the Con-
gress 
need 
these 
legislative 
point 
guards in order for Agencies to run as 
smoothly as possible. 
This isn’t a policy position, nor is 
Jon Davidson a nominee who raises 
any major concern from anybody. I 
have yet to hear even anything resem-
bling a substantive reason from Senate 
Republicans for opposing a nominee 
like Jon Davidson, who got a 28-to- 
nothing vote out of committee to lead 
this office. There is no reason for de-
laying any longer. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the fol-
lowing nomination: Calendar No. 168, 
Jonathan 
Davidson, 
to 
be 
Deputy 
Under Secretary of the Treasury; that 
the nomination be confirmed, the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate; that no fur-
ther motions be in order to the nomi-
nation; and that the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion.

HICKENLOOPER). Is there objection?

ator from Texas.

lawless, in that he is refusing to im-
pose mandatory congressional sanc-
tions passed by Congress in the Coun-
tering America’s Adversaries Through 
Sanctions Act, also known as CAATSA. 
CAATSA was designed for precisely 
the purpose of taking away the Presi-
dent’s discretion to impose sanctions 
on Russia in cases where Congress 
deemed it necessary to mandate them. 
CAATSA passed Congress overwhelm-
ingly. The vote was 98 to 2. Indeed, in 
September 2020, my colleague Senator 
WYDEN wrote a letter that was joined 
by 10 other Democrats about Russian 
malign activities. 
Senator WYDEN’s letter stated: ‘‘Con-
gress has mandated a broad range of 
sanctions tools, and it is long past time 
for the administration to send a direct 
message to President Putin.’’ 
The letter continues, specifically cit-
ing the ‘‘sanctions mandated provided 
for in’’ CAATSA. 
President Biden is legally obligated 
to Nord Stream 2 AG, the company re-
sponsible for the planning, the con-
struction, and the eventual operation 
of Putin’s Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. 
Nord Stream 2 AG has committed 
acts that require the imposition of 
these 
mandated 
sanctions 
under 
CAATSA Section 228. Section 228 man-
dates sanctions on any company that 
conducts 
any 
‘‘significant 
trans-
actions,’’ including ‘‘deceptive trans-
actions,’’ for Russian companies that 
are already sanctioned. 
In May, the Biden State Department 
sent 
Congress 
a 
certification 
con-
firming that Nord Stream 2 AG had en-
gaged in those actions. It is clear that 
Nord Stream 2 AG falls under the man-
datory sanctions of CAATSA. Nobody, 
not even the Biden administration, de-
nies that the Biden State Department 
sent 
that 
certification 
confirming 
those actions. Nevertheless, President 
Biden and, in particular, the Depart-
ment of Treasury is refusing to imple-
ment the law. 
I have spoken directly with Sec-
retary Yellen. I have spoken directly 
with the Deputy Secretary of Treasury. 
The law is clear and unequivocal. And 
because of the political agenda of the 
Biden White House, because of Presi-
dent Biden’s desire to surrender to 
Vladimir Putin and to give him a 
multibillion-dollar pipeline, weakening 
America, weakening Europe, and giv-
ing vast resources to Putin to hold Eu-
rope 
subject 
to 
energy 
blackmail, 
Treasury is refusing to follow the law. 
Nevertheless, I have been willing to 
offer a compromise. I have placed holds 
on nominees to the State Department 
and some of the nominees to the Treas-
ury Department. And I have offered a 
compromise to lift the holds on this 
nominee and other nominees to the 
Treasury Department, and also to lift 
the holds on career nominees to State 
if either the Biden administration fol-
lows the law in CAATSA and impose 
sanctions. That is option A. That 
would be the best option. 
Or option B, if they decide because, 
for whatever political reason, they be-
lieve surrendering to Putin is a good 
idea notwithstanding America’s na-
tional security interest, there is a sec-
ond option that I have offered to lift 
those holds, which is they could impose 
the sanctions under CAATSA and then 
immediately delist Nord Stream 2 AG. 
That would prevent the sanctions from 
going into effect, but it would also 
trigger an automatic vote here in this 
Congress to override that decision. 
I have made that offer, along with 
Senator TOOMEY, in writing months 
ago. It is a reasonable compromise, and 
yet the Biden administration won’t 
take it. They won’t take it because 
they are terrified, if and when Congress 
votes on that override, that an over-
whelming bipartisan majority of Con-
gress in the Senate and the House will 
vote to override Joe Biden’s indefen-
sible decision to surrender to Vladimir 
Putin. 
Nonetheless, in the spirit of reason-
ableness, I am happy to offer the Sen-
ator from Oregon the same deal or a 
similar deal, at least, right here and 
right now.

Mr. President, there is a bill that I 
filed that imposes CAATSA 228 sanc-
tions on Nord Stream 2 AG. Every 
Democrat in this Chamber has sup-
ported sanctions on Nord Stream 2. 
In a moment, I am going to ask for 
unanimous consent to pass the legisla-
tion simply mandating that the Biden 
administration, that the Treasury De-
partment—and this is a Treasury nomi-
nee that we are discussing—follow the 
law. 
If the Senator from Oregon will agree 
to my unanimous consent request and 
that bill passes the Senate, I will not 
object to this nominee if the Senator 
from Oregon is willing to accept that, 
because that will move the process 
along. The objective is to stop this 
pipeline that strengthens Putin, weak-
ens Europe, and weakens America. 
And, indeed, if we pass the legislation 
mandating the CAATSA sanctions, I 
won’t object to this nominee. When 
that legislation passes the House, I will 
lift my hold on another Treasury nomi-
nee. And when the President does the 
right thing and signs it into law, I will 
lift my holds on all the Treasury nomi-
nees. 
So it is a reasonable, incremental 
step forward that gives the Senator 
from 
Oregon 
the 
chance 
to 
dem-
onstrate that when Democrats give 
speeches about how Nord Stream 2 is 
bad for America, bad for Europe, bad 
for the environment but good for Rus-
sia and Putin, we can now discover 
whether or not Democrats actually be-
lieve what they have said in speeches 
so many times. 
Therefore, I ask that the Senator 
modify his request so that in addition 
to confirming the nomination and, as if 
in legislative session, that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 2894, which is at the desk; 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let’s un-
derstand exactly what is at issue here. 
Jonathan Davidson has been nomi-
nated to be the Deputy Under Sec-
retary for Legislative Affairs. In that 
particular role, he would not be di-
rectly involved in decisions over sanc-
tions, No. 1. 
No. 2, when it comes to Nord Stream 
2, the Biden administration, to their 
credit, has recognized the threat from 
Russia, but also that the pipeline is 
nearly complete and the Trump admin-
istration failed to stop the construc-
tion. 
Everything my colleague from Texas 
is raising in his concerns about Nord 
Stream 2 is already happening with an-
other pipeline—Turk Stream 2—and 
my colleague is aware of this. He has 
been briefed repeatedly. 
Now, for those who don’t have access 
to the same kind of information that 
my colleague has, gas is already being 
diverted from Ukraine into Europe 
through Turk Stream 2 because the 
past administration did nothing about 
that pipeline either. 
The Biden administration has actu-
ally put a plan forward to mitigate the 
effects of Nord Stream 2 and has re-
ceived concrete agreements from the 
Germans to move Ukraine toward en-
ergy independence and address Russian 
threats. 
I am just going to close with just an-
other dose of good government. The 9/ 
11 
Commission 
specifically 
warned 
about the need to have senior, con-
firmed individuals in place to avoid a 
threat to the homeland. And, by the 
way, we did that during the Trump ad-
ministration. We have far less people 
confirmed today than we did in 2001, 
before 9/11. 
In my view, this has got to end. For 
these reasons, I object to the UC. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection to the modification is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object. I recognize that my 
friend from Oregon has been busy with 
affairs on the Finance Committee and 
so has not been involved in the now 2 
years of debate over Nord Stream 2 on 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. But, unfortunately, that has 
resulted in the Senator from Oregon 
being given talking points—perhaps 
from the administration, perhaps from 
colleagues—that are simply factually 
incorrect. I am sure that is inad-
vertent. 
The Senator from Oregon just said 
that there is no way to stop this pipe-
line, and that the Trump administra-
tion failed to impose sanctions to stop

the pipeline. Both of those statements 
are factually wrong. 
I was the author of two separate 
pieces of legislation that passed into 
law concerning Nord Stream 2. Both 
were bipartisan legislation. Both, I au-
thored with Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
a Democrat, in the Senate. Both passed 
with overwhelming bipartisan support 
from both Houses of Congress. 
The first bill passed in December of 
2019. Nord Stream 2 at the time was 
more than 90 percent complete, and the 
argument then that was being pushed 
by Russian disinformation and that, 
sadly, has been echoed by the Biden ad-
ministration and was just echoed by 
the Senator from Oregon—the argu-
ment from Russian disinformation was, 
the pipeline can’t be stopped; it is too 
late. 
We 
know 
that 
was 
Russian 
disinformation because it was conclu-
sively disproved. Putin stopped build-
ing the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline the 
very day that the Cruz-Shaheen bipar-
tisan sanctions were signed into law— 
not the next day, not the next week. 
That day, we stopped the pipeline in its 
tracks. 
But, Mr. President, it was not only 
stopped for 1 day; it was stopped for 
more than a year. For December of 
2019, for January, February, March— 
every month in 2020, the pipeline lay 
dormant. It was a piece of metal at the 
bottom of the ocean. So the claim that 
we cannot stop this pipeline is flat-out 
false because we did. 
By the way, when the Senator from 
Oregon said the Trump administration 
couldn’t stop this pipeline, that, again, 
is just incorrect. When the President 
signed the legislation, the pipeline was 
stopped that day. It remained stopped 
for over a year. 
When did Putin return to building 
this pipeline? The date is important. 
Putin returned to building the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline on January 24, 2021, 
4 days after Joe Biden was sworn into 
office. And he did so because Joe Biden 
and his team had already conveyed 
weakness that they would not enforce 
U.S. sanctions law and that they would 
roll over and give Putin and Russia a 
generational geopolitical gift. The only 
reason Putin began building again is 
because the Biden White House defied 
U.S. law to surrender to Putin. 
Now, Joe Biden is entitled to believe 
that is a good policy idea. What he is 
not entitled to do is ignore U.S. law. 
And the Senator from Oregon suggests 
this nominee has nothing to do with 
that. Well, it is the Department of the 
Treasury that is ignoring the CAATSA 
law, that is refusing to follow the pol-
icy. 
Sadly, this moment marks a new 
threshold in that debate. Up until this 
point, it has only been the Biden White 
House that has been surrendering to 
Russia. Sadly, now we have a Demo-
cratic Member of the Senate objecting 
to legislation to stop the Biden White 
House from surrendering to Russia. 
That is a move in the wrong direction. 
That being said, my offer of reason-
able compromise remains if we can 
come together as we have repeatedly, 
Republicans and Democrats, to force 
the President to obey the law and to 
stop surrendering to Russia in a way 
that hurts America, hurts Europe. 
By the way, the European Par-
liament—my friends on the Democratic 
side of the aisle like to consider them-
selves lovers of our friends in Europe. 
The European Parliament voted on 
Nord Stream 2. The vote was roughly 
500 to 50 against Nord Stream 2 because 
it makes our European allies subject to 
energy blackmail by Putin and his suc-
cessor dictators. 
This is bad for America, bad for Eu-
rope, bad for peace, bad for the envi-
ronment, but good for Vladimir Putin 
and for Russia. Joe Biden is mistaken 
to be committing this surrender, and 
my friend from Oregon errs in joining 
Joe Biden in that surrender to Russia. 
I hope the Senator from Oregon re-
considers. I hope Congress comes to-
gether again. But as long as that does 
not happen, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection was heard. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am 
going to be very brief and then make a 
unanimous consent request. 
Again, we have a difference of opin-
ion with respect to the facts. That is 
what the Senate is all about—real de-
bate. In a moment, I am going to ask 
unanimous consent to put into the 
RECORD at this point an article from 
just a few days ago from the Wall 
Street Journal that makes the truth 
about Nord Stream 2 AG very clear. 
In effect, in the Wall Street Journal 
article that we are going to put into 
the RECORD, the pipeline owner said 
last week that construction on the 
pipeline has been completed. 
There is no reason to object to this 
very talented individual, John David-
son, to head this important post after 
he got a 28-to-0 vote in the Senate Fi-
nance Committee. 
I think this article in the Wall Street 
Journal that I have just asked to be 
printed in the RECORD at this point in 
the debate, so we can make sure the 
facts are correct, supports our basic 
proposition on this side of the aisle. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 13] 
SENATE REPUBLICANS VOW TO BLOCK TREAS-
URY NOMINATIONS UNTIL NORD STREAM II 
FIRM IS SANCTIONED 
(By Ian Talley and Brett Forrest) 
WASHINGTON.—Senior Senate Republicans 
on Monday threatened to indefinitely hold 
up the nominations of five top Treasury De-
partment officials if the Biden administra-
tion doesn’t blacklist the firm managing 
Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. 
Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) and Ted Cruz 
(R., Texas) said they are prepared to approve 
the nominations, including two national se-
curity posts that oversee sanctions and 
counterterror finance, if the Treasury De-
partment 
blacklists 
Russia-owned 
Nord 
Stream 2 AG. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
has 
imple-
mented sanctions against several firms that 
have provided support to the project but not 
against Nord Stream 2 AG, saying that it 
would irritate relations with critical ally 
Germany and do little to stop the project, 
given that it was near completion. Gazprom, 
Russia’s state-controlled gas-export monop-
oly and the pipeline owner, said last week 
that construction on the pipeline had been 
completed. But there are still bureaucratic 
hurdles that have to be overcome to get it 
running. 
Nord Stream 2 is designed to accommodate 
the transmission of 55 billion cubic meters of 
gas annually, the company said. 
Republicans say they are concerned the 
pipeline project bolsters Europe’s reliance on 
Russian energy and gives Moscow leverage 
over Washington’s trans-Atlantic allies. By 
holding up the five top Treasury nomina-
tions, they hope to pressure the administra-
tion into sanctioning the managing firm and 
stymie the pipeline’s startup. 
‘‘The administration’s so-called ‘deal’ with 
Germany 
hands 
Vladimir 
Putin 
a 
geostrategic 
victory, 
entrenches 
corrupt 
Russian influence in Europe, and drastically 
weakens the security of Ukraine, Poland, 
and other states on the frontline of Kremlin 
aggression,’’ Mr. Toomey, the ranking mem-
ber of the Banking Committee, and Mr. Cruz 
said in a letter to the chairmen of the Senate 
Banking and Foreign Relations Committees. 
A Treasury spokeswoman said that while 
the department has experienced career staff 
who are experts in their fields, ‘‘The Senate 
should move quickly to confirm these nomi-
nees who are integral to disrupting illicit fi-
nance, combating terrorism, and admin-
istering sanctions.’’ 
Nord Stream 2 AG officials didn’t respond 
to a request for comment. 
The Banking Committee is scheduled to 
vote Wednesday on the nominations of Brian 
Nelson as the Treasury’s undersecretary for 
terrorism and financial intelligence and Eliz-
abeth Rosenberg for the role of assistant sec-
retary for terrorism financing. 
Without Republican support in the com-
mittee, Democratic lawmakers face long 
odds getting the nominations approved. 
That could leave empty the post respon-
sible for overseeing U.S. sanctions policy, ex-
tending a vacancy that has already lasted 
nearly two years. The nominations of Jona-
than Davidson as deputy undersecretary, 
Lily Lawrence Batchelder as assistant sec-
retary for tax policy and Benjamin Harris as 
assistant secretary for economic policy all 
have been committee-approved, but full Sen-
ate ratification has been held up by Mr. 
Cruz. 
The Texas Republican said he’s prepared to 
lift his holds—as well as those he has on 
nearly two dozen State Department appoint-
ments—if the administration commits to 
sanctioning the Russian project management 
firm. 
Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.), the chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, didn’t immediately respond to a re-
quest for comment. The chairman of the 
Banking Committee, Sen. Sherrod Brown 
(D., Ohio), directed questions to the State 
Department and White House. ‘‘Decisions on 
sanctions regarding the NS II pipeline are 
made by the administration,’’ a spokes-
woman for Mr. Brown said. 
The Republican senators say a federal law 
called the Countering America’s Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act, signed into law in 
2017, mandates blacklisting companies or in-
dividuals involved in evasion of the act’s 
sanctions. They say the provisions allow for 
the administration to delist the company, 
but that opens the door for Congress to vote 
on the issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6768 
September 29, 2021 
Republican aides said the law mandating 
sanctions had bipartisan support, fueled by 
concern the Trump administration would 
treat Moscow too favorably. Given that some 
Democratic lawmakers opposed the Biden 
administration’s Nord Stream 2 decision, 
those aides said Congress could vote to keep 
the firm on Treasury’s blacklists. 
The risk of sanctions, the aides said, could 
dissuade companies from providing certifi-
cation. 
In November, Norwegian certification com-
pany DNV suspended its work on Nord 
Stream 2 after assessing that its activities 
could expose the company to sanctions under 
Protecting Europe’s Energy Security Act, a 
2019 U.S. law specific to the pipeline, a com-
pany spokesman said. 
Last week, Germany’s energy regulator 
Bundesnetzagentur received Nord Stream 2 
AG’s application for an operating license. 
The company has four months to engage an 
independent certification company to com-
plete an assessment of the pipeline’s oper-
ational integrity. 
Once a certification is complete, the Ger-
man regulator would send its decision to the 
European Commission, but this isn’t the 
final hurdle to gas flows. Initial deliveries 
could face additional, unrelated delays. Last 
month, 
a 
German 
court 
rejected 
Nord 
Stream 2 AG’s bid to bypass a European 
Union pro-competition regulation mandating 
that a gas producer and the company that 
transports the gas be separate entities. 
One of the congressional aides said the 
Biden 
administration, 
besides 
worrying 
about creating diplomatic friction with al-
lies, may also be concerned about setting 
precedent 
regarding 
sanctions, 
because 
Treasury officials also could have to sanc-
tion other companies. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I don’t 
have objection to the article being in-
cluded in the RECORD, but I would note 
that, once again, the Senator from Or-
egon is limited by the fact that he has 
not participated in the debate on this 
in the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee for the last 2 years, because 
what he stated in his first remarks was 
that there was no way to stop the pipe-
line initially and the Trump adminis-
tration failed to do so. That was factu-
ally incorrect. 
We stopped the pipeline the day 
President Trump signed the bipartisan 
Cruz-Shaheen sanctions into law. That 
was December of 2019, and the pipeline 
was stopped for over a year. As I men-
tioned, on January 24 of 2020, 4 days 
after Joe Biden was sworn into office, 
Putin began—returned to building the 
pipeline because Biden had already 
telegraphed his surrender to Russia. 
Now, what my friend from Oregon 
just said is—he repeated news coverage 
that the pipeline is now, today, com-
plete. That is, in fact, correct, that be-
cause Biden surrendered on this point, 
Putin went all in and finished the pipe-
line. But this is where being part of the 
Foreign Relations Committee discus-
sion matters, because even though the 
pipeline is now physically complete, it 
does not mean it is operative. After the 
pipeline is physically complete, there 
are months of certifications required 
and multiple authorities. 
The legislation that Congress passed 
as a bipartisan matter also imposes 
sanctions on any entity, any company 
that certifies the pipeline. Indeed, the 
position of the Biden State Department 
has been that even when the pipeline is 
complete, we can stop it from ever 
going online by stopping certification. 
So the legislation that I just asked 
for consent would do exactly that—it 
would stop certification, and it would 
leave it as a hunk of metal rather than 
an operating pipeline enriching Putin 
at the expense of Europe and America. 
So we still have time to stop this. 
One final observation. This morning, 
I spent a couple of hours in a classified 
briefing on this topic, on Nord Stream 
2. A question that I posed to the Biden 
State Department—I said: What ex-
actly did Joe Biden, did the adminis-
tration get in exchange for surren-
dering to Russia in a way that will im-
pact this country and Europe for dec-
ades to come? 
The answer, I will say, was alto-
gether unsatisfactory. The only thing 
the Biden White House got was good 
will from Angela Merkel, whose party 
was just defeated resoundingly this 
past weekend in the election. So An-
gela Merkel is on her way out. We got 
good will from someone who will very 
soon no longer be the leader of Ger-
many. 
Instead, the German people voted 
in—elevated the Greens, who were vo-
cally opposed to the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline. So the new government in 
Germany is not going to appreciate 
Biden surrendering to Putin in a way 
that hurts the environment and hurts 
Germany. But we have alienated the 
Ukrainians; we have alienated the 
Poles; we have alienated Eastern Eu-
rope. The European Union voted 500 to 
50, roughly, against Nord Stream 2. We 
got nothing, and we hurt U.S. jobs. 
This is foolhardy, and I am hopeful 
that the Senate will exercise our his-
torical role over foreign policy and pre-
vent a President and an administration 
from making this mistake. 
I would note, Secretary of State 
Blinken and the State Department ar-
gued vociferously in the interagency 
process to sanction Nord Stream 2 AG, 
and it was the political operatives at 
the Biden White House who overrode 
the State Department. They should not 
have done so, and today the Depart-
ment of the Treasury should follow the 
law 
and 
impose 
sanctions 
under 
CAATSA or delist them and trigger a 
vote in this Congress. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
(The remarks of Mr. SCOTT of Flor-
ida, Mr. JOHNSON, and Mr. LEE per-
taining to the introduction of S. 2895 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2895 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
as if in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of S. 
2895, introduced earlier today. I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Sen-
ator SCOTT’s bill would prohibit the De-
partment of Transportation, Amtrak, 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion, or other Agencies from requiring 
passengers in interstate transportation 
to show proof of COVID–19 in order to 
travel. 
I appreciate my colleagues—all of 
whom I serve with on the Commerce 
Committee. I know that they know 
well—we have had a lot of discussions 
about the impacts of COVID–19 on our 
transportation sector. They know very 
well that we had to spend a lot of re-
sources keeping our transportation sec-
tor moving. 
Why? 
Because we have to move goods and 
services and products. During COVID– 
19, we had to move essential workers, 
and we had to move product. 
There is no doubt our transportation 
system needs to have keen oversight as 
it relates to moving in even a pan-
demic. That is what we did. I am proud 
of the work that we did. But it is not 
lost on anybody that COVID–19, the 
deadliest pandemic in U.S. history—as 
of September 28, there have already 
been 700,000 COVID–19-related deaths in 
the United States and over 43 million 
infections. In my State, 7,586 deaths 
and 652,000 cases. 
So the point is here, we have been 
fighting this pandemic with all of these 
tools and no one has ever suggested the 
one—that Senator SCOTT nor my col-
leagues from the Commerce Committee 
are saying what the President might 
do. That is not what he has suggested. 
In fact, I was very involved in an 
area of transportation where we want-
ed to get cruise ships back in service to 
Alaska at a critical moment—both for 
Alaska and a critical moment during 
the 
pandemic. 
Not 
everybody 
was 
ready to have that happen; not every-
body was ready to move. And yet it 
meant so much to Alaska that we all 
worked together. And in some in-
stances, those cruise ships said: We are 
going to require the vaccine. 
So the point is here, we are not try-
ing to mandate this. Now, if the Presi-
dent and the industry feel that it is im-
portant to have a workforce so that 
that workforce continues to serve us 
and conserve the growing response to 
the pandemic—which I mean respond-
ing to the aftermath of the pandemic— 
that is why we spent money. That is 
why we are trying to take off. That is 
why we are trying to return a work-
force. That is why we are returning

kids to school. That is why we are try-
ing to get our hospitals staffed. That is 
why we are doing things. 
That is the only thing the President 
said, is that those people should get a 
vaccine. He has not said, if you want to 
get on an airplane, you have to get vac-
cinated—maybe if you are flying over-
seas and have to work with another 
country. 
My colleague from Florida knows all 
too well because he and I are working 
together to try to get temperature 
checks in a very broad way established 
at airports through the U.S. We have 
agreed that is a smart thing to do. It 
has been done on an international basis 
for a long time and it prevents people 
from getting on a plane who are sick. 
The President has not said this. 
To now put a bill through that might 
have prohibited the cruise ship indus-
try reestablishing service up to Alaska 
because now, all of a sudden, you are 
going to have all of these things is not 
the way I want to go. 
I like what we have been able to 
achieve. It has taken hard work and 
working together. It does not take us 
passing this bill by Senator SCOTT. 
I object, and I hope my colleagues 
understand that we are willing to work 
on anything related to the transpor-
tation sector so it can keep our U.S. 
economy moving. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. First off, I am 
disappointed my colleague objected. I 
think No. 1 is this is unconstitutional. 
First off, President Biden promised he 
wouldn’t be doing this. This is uncon-
stitutional. 
Here is what it is going to do. If you 
talk to businesses around this country, 
they are already struggling to get peo-
ple back to work because of excess 
funding that has been provided. And 
now we are going to tell a bunch of 
people that you can’t come back to 
work because you haven’t been vac-
cinated. We are going to tell people, 
you can’t get on an airplane because 
you haven’t been vaccinated. 
This is wrong. This is not what the 
Federal Government ought to be doing. 
They ought to do what I did when I was 
Governor. You give people the informa-
tion and feel comfortable that the 
American public will make a good deci-
sion. 
I think this is a mistake. I hope my 
colleague will change her mind. And I 
hope this President will not continue 
down the path of requiring Americans 
to get vaccinations, because I don’t 
think it is fair to Americans and I 
think it is unconstitutional. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
TRIBUTE TO SUSAN MEUSCHKE 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
today, I want to recognize a friend of 
mine, Susan Meuschke, who is the Ex-
ecutive Director of the Nevada Coali-
tion to End Domestic and Sexual Vio-
lence. She is retiring after three dec-
ades working on behalf of women and 
children in my home State of Nevada. 
Sue has been a champion for victims 
of domestic violence and their families 
since she worked as a volunteer for the 
Committee to Aid Abused Women in 
Reno, NV. It was there—listening to 
the stories of women dealing with fam-
ily violence—that she began to under-
stand both their struggles and their 
courage. 
Sue went on to work with the coali-
tion for 32 years, helping develop it 
into a powerful organization statewide 
for those affected by domestic and sex-
ual violence. 
I have had the pleasure of working 
with Sue since I was Nevada’s attorney 
general, and together we passed legisla-
tion to create dedicated funding for do-
mestic violence programs. She has con-
tinued to be a resource for me during 
my time in the U.S. Senate, as I have 
worked to prevent sex trafficking, to 
stem the tide of violence against Na-
tive women, and push for the reauthor-
ization of the Violence Against Women 
Act. 
During the height of the COVID–19 
pandemic, I pushed to make sure that 
our next COVID package included more 
support for survivors of domestic vio-
lence. Sue worked to distribute those 
Federal funds fairly and effectively to 
Nevadans, and she worked especially 
hard to promote a microloan program 
that families could use to regain finan-
cial independence. 
As Sue enters her retirement, I want 
to make sure everyone in Nevada ap-
preciates her decades of advocacy. She 
has made a profound difference for 
families in the Silver State. I have no 
doubt that whoever succeeds Sue at the 
coalition will continue to work tire-
lessly to end domestic and sexual vio-
lence, because, honestly, we still have 
so much work to do. 
That is why I am here on the Senate 
floor today. The reality is that wom-
en’s rights are under attack around the 
country, and that includes reproduc-
tive rights. Anti-abortion extremists 
are going to great lengths to stop 
women from seeking reproductive care. 
As of June, they had proposed 500 new 
laws restricting reproductive rights 
and passed 70 of these laws. 
Let’s start with Texas, where a new 
law prohibits abortions before many 
people even know they are pregnant. 
The law lets anyone sue those who aid 
and abet abortions and get a $10,000 re-
ward. It has the potential to create a 
whole industry of vigilantes prying 
into their neighbors’ lives, all to stop 
women from being able to access repro-
ductive healthcare. 
The American people—70 percent of 
us—oppose deputizing private citizens 
to collect these kinds of bounties. 
But even though the Texas law is ex-
treme, the Supreme Court has refused 
to stop it from going into effect. That 
means that, right now, 7 million 
women of reproductive age in Texas 
have been deprived of a key constitu-
tional right, a right that they have had 
for 50 years. 
Clinics in Oklahoma City, OK, and 
Little Rock, AR, have seen the number 
of Texas women seeking abortions 
jump tenfold in a matter of days. 
But it is not just Texas where the 
right to medical care is threatened. 
Dangerous abortion bans have been 
signed into law in Mississippi, Arizona, 
and Georgia, among others. And all of 
this is happening because anti-abortion 
extremists have been working for dec-
ades to limit women’s choices. 
Let’s be very clear: they are on the 
brink of success. On December 1, the 
Supreme Court is set to hear oral argu-
ments in a case called Dobbs v. Jack-
son Women’s Health, which deals with 
an abortion ban in Mississippi. This 
case was specifically chosen by anti- 
choice activists to help strike down 
Roe v. Wade. 
Sadly, the Court has given every sig-
nal it is willing to do the activists’ bid-
ding by overturning Roe v. Wade and 
allowing these bans to take effect. 
That is why I and 47 of my Senate col-
leagues filed a friend of the court brief 
last week, calling on the Supreme 
Court to stick to the settled precedent 
of Roe and strike down the Mississippi 
law. 
But if the Supreme Court doesn’t 
abide by 50 years of its own rulings, 
well, there are 19 States where abor-
tion would be illegal the day after a 
Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe 
V. Wade, and others where abortion 
bans would likely follow. 
All in all, nearly half of women na-
tionwide will see the nearest clinic 
close. The average distance to the 
nearest clinic for those seeking repro-
ductive care will jump from 25 to 279 
miles. Anyone who has ever worked a 
minimum-wage job knows that they 
don’t have the luxury of traveling hun-
dreds of miles for healthcare. 
Women’s healthcare isn’t optional. 
Nevadans know this. That is why we 
worked so hard in Nevada to protect 
the right to choose. 
In the nineties, we passed a ballot 
initiative to enshrine choice into law, 
and we have actually done away with 
the kind of restrictions on abortion 
that are popping up in State after 
State. 
But what we are seeing in Texas and 
other States across the country threat-
ens the future of Roe V. Wade every-
where. Let me be clear: It threatens 
the future of Roe V. Wade everywhere. 
And without Roe, there will be no Fed-
eral protections in place, paving the 
way for anti-choice lawmakers to pass 
legislation 
to 
restrict 
reproductive 
rights anywhere in the country. 
And that is why it is so important for 
the Senate to pass the Women’s Health 
Protection Act. This bill would outlaw 
bans in other medically unnecessary 
restrictions on abortion across the 
country. It would mean that States 
could not impose medically unneces-
sary ultrasounds, excessive waiting pe-
riods, 
and 
extreme 
burdens

healthcare providers intended to limit 
abortion access. 
In Nevada and across the country, 
the vast majority of voters believes 
that women should get to make their 
own decisions about their reproductive 
health, including when and whether to 
have a child. We cannot let a dedicated 
minority take that right away from 
the rest of us. 
Let me just say, I am going to keep 
working on this issue because it is so 
important to Nevadans and to women 
all over this country. This is about 
making sure that women can control 
their own bodies and their futures, and 
I will always stand up for that. 
I yield the floor.

The Senator from Rhode Island. 
REDUCE ACT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
want to talk a moment about my RE-
DUCE Act, which is the act to reduce 
plastic pollution, of which we have a 
lot. 
Humans have created 8 billion tons of 
plastic, and it is all over the place. It 
is in our water. It is in our rivers. It is 
in our food. The Presiding Officer is 
from Colorado. As he knows, there was 
a study done that tested the rain fall-
ing in Colorado that showed that there 
were microplastics in the raindrops in 
Colorado. 
So we have a plastics problem, and 
this is a bill whose intention is to solve 
that plastics problem. 
I want to have you think about three 
numbers while I am making this 
speech: 2 percent, 10 percent, and 2050; 
2 percent, 10 percent, and 2050. 
What is 2 percent? Two percent is 
how much recycled plastic the plastics 
industry uses in single-use, disposable, 
throwaway plastic. 
We had a hearing in the Environment 
and Public Works Committee, led by 
Chairman CARPER. We had witnesses in 
who were experts. They said it is actu-
ally less than 2 percent. So the plastics 
industry is comfortable with a business 
model in which they are only using re-
cycled plastic for less than 2 percent of 
their production of single-use, dispos-
able stuff. 
They will then say: Well, yeah, but 
we don’t need to worry about that be-
cause then it goes into the recycling 
bin. 
Well, first of all, that is not much 
help if you are only going to use 2 per-
cent recycled plastic in your plastic 
manufacturing and then 98 percent is 
all new fossil fuel-based plastic. 
But here we get to the second num-
ber, 10 percent. When you put plastic in 
that blue bin and send it out to be re-
cycled, less than 10 percent of that 
plastic actually gets recycled. Some 
people have said 6 percent. Some peo-
ple have said 8 percent. Some people 
have said 9 percent. But pretty much 
everybody agrees that less than 10 per-
cent of what you put in the recycling 
bin to recycle ever gets recycled. And 
the plastics industry is cool with that 
too. 
The plastics industry is cool with 2 
percent recycling content in their 
throughput, in their supply, and they 
are comfortable with 90 percent or 
more of your recycled plastics sent out 
in the blue bins never being recycled. 
This brings me to the third number, 
2050. Twenty-fifty is the year which, on 
present trends, will produce the fol-
lowing state of affairs: There will be 
more waste plastic floating in the 
Earth’s oceans by mass than there will 
be living fish. That is the trajectory we 
are on with an industry that is totally 
content to use only 2 percent recycled 
plastic in its production and to have 
the recycling system recycle less than 
10 percent of the plastic that goes in. 
That is where we end up by 2050. And if 
we are content in this room to confer 
on our children and grandchildren a 
world in which there is more waste 
plastic floating around than there is 
living fish, then shame on us. 
This is a trajectory we have to 
change, and my bill will change it. But, 
of course, the plastic industry doesn’t 
love this. They are happy with using 
only 2 percent recycled plastic in their 
production. They are happy with less 
than 10 percent of recycled plastic in 
the blue bin ever getting recycled. 
They don’t seem to give a red hot damn 
about the trajectory we are on with 
where we are going to be with waste 
plastic in the oceans. But they obvi-
ously care a lot about the bill because 
if you lived in Washington, DC, and 
you got the Washington 
Post 
on 
Wednesday, September 22, you got this 
little gem tucked in your newspaper on 
the front. It is a very glossy, multicol-
ored handout, and it says: 
Stop the plastic tax. Keep everyday goods 
affordable. 
And then it shows a whole bunch of 
everyday goods: a bicycle helmet, reus-
able plastic containers that you use in 
your refrigerator to put stuff away 
when you are putting it back in the 
fridge, sneakers, a plastic child’s toy, 
and a baby diaper. 
Not one of those things is covered by 
our plastics tax—not one of them—not 
personal hygiene products like a diaper 
and not multiuse products like a 
child’s toy or a sneaker or a bicycle 
helmet or the plastic containers that 
you store stuff in in your refrigerator. 
If you flip it over, they go at it even 
further. There is a child’s baby seat. 
There is solar paneling. There is a 
toothbrush. There is a cellphone. And 
there is a little package of tomatoes in 
Saran wrap in one of those foam 
Styrofoam containers. 
The one thing on this whole page 
that this plastics pollution fee would 
touch is that disposable bit of foam. 
And if you would rather have that in 
the ocean instead of being recycled, 
fine; vote against this bill. But if you 
would like to see that kind of junk get 
properly disposed of, you need to sup-
port the act. 
So why do you think the industry got 
this so wrong? Bicycle helmets, chil-
dren’s toys, car seats, toothbrushes? Do 
you think they actually didn’t know 
what was in the bill or is it possible 
that they are just lying about the bill? 
And what conclusion do you draw when 
an industry is lying about a piece of 
legislation? The conclusion that I draw 
is that they know they would lose if 
they argued on the truth, and so they 
lie. 
And they spent a lot of money on 
this. This is, you know, glossy. This is 
multicolor. We in politics, we send out 
mailers. This is not inexpensive. You 
put this onto every Washington Post— 
that is a big deal. They flooded the DC 
metropolitan area with this glossy 
pack of lies.

So let’s just take a quick look at 
some of the stuff that they have been 
saying. Their myth is that the RE-
DUCE Act affects all plastic products. 
No. Read the bill. It is a fee on single- 
use plastics that targets the fossil fuel 
companies that make the fossil fuel 
feedstock for those single-use dispos-
able plastic products. 
All you have to do is read the bill to 
see that. I don’t know how we could 
make that any clearer. We specifically 
exempt anything other than single-use 
disposable plastics. 
Further, if it is a single-use dispos-
able plastic that is used in healthcare, 
that is used in hospitals, in patient 
treatments, we understand that; we ex-
empt that too. It is the plastic spoons 
and the straws and the wrapping and 
the foam containers and all the rest of 
that junk that you can walk down any 
beach in America and see; that is the 
junk we are trying to see gets properly 
recycled by charging a fee on the peo-
ple who are throwing this stuff out into 
the environment and not recycling it— 
or at least 98 percent not recycling it. 
Here is the other myth: The REDUCE 
Act disadvantages U.S. businesses; we 
will fail in international competition if 
we do this. 
Not true. If you are importing plas-
tic, you have to pay just the same way 
as if you used U.S.-made plastic. This 
is a fee on plastic that touches the U.S. 
economy if it is going to be single-use 
disposable, and we are going to need to 
think about recycling it. It applies to 
any company doing business in the 
United States and imports from foreign 
companies. So that is another made-up 
myth. 
And the last one, which is really— 
maybe it is designed to annoy me, but 
it is that the fee on plastics to encour-
age recycling would actually harm our 
climate; that this is an anti-climate 
piece of legislation. 
The fact of the matter is that by the 
middle of the century, plastics will ac-
count for about a quarter of global oil 
consumption. This is what the fossil 
fuel industry is banking on for its fu-
ture as we start driving electric cars 
that are nicer than internal combus-
tion cars and cheaper and easier to 
maintain. 
By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions 
from new plastics production will reach 
1.3 billion tons—1.3 billion tons—which 
is equivalent to running 300 coal-fired 
powerplants. That doesn’t sound to me 
much like sustainability. 
This REDUCE Act is a fair and sen-
sible and effective response to plastic 
pollution that is filling up our oceans, 
our rivers, and even our raindrops. The 
costs will be paid by the fossil fuel in-
dustry where the profit is made. 
And by the way, when they try to 
push that cost down to consumers, 
good luck, ExxonMobil, telling Coca- 
Cola: We are raising our prices to you. 
Coca-Cola and all of its beverage com-
panies have got pretty significant mar-
ket clout, and they might just say: Not 
so fast, pal; you eat that cost. This is 
your mess; you clean it up. 
Anyway, it is a good discussion to 
have because 2 percent of the plastics 
stream being recycled, 10 percent or 
less of plastic in the blue bins ever ac-
tually being recycled, and an ocean 
that has equal parts waste plastic and 
fish in it by 2050 is not acceptable. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
TAXES 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor today to talk about 
the massive tax increases that are 
being proposed by my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle and by the Biden 
administration and by the Democrats 
in the House as a way to pay for this 
big, new spending package—$3.5 trillion 
is what it is advertised as, although 
some say that, if you do the full 10- 
year calculation, it is more like $5 tril-
lion. But it is a lot of money, and the 
way it is paid for is by a huge increase 
in taxes. It is the biggest tax increase, 
actually, we are told, in over 50 years. 
And I have been on the floor talking 
about this a few different times, and I 
talked about the impact on the econ-
omy, generally. I talked about the im-
pact on our competitiveness inter-
nationally, which we finally fixed in 
2017, which was really a bipartisan idea 
to go to a different kind of system, and 
it has worked so well. 
But today I want to talk about an-
other sector of our economy that is 
going to be hit really hard by these 
taxes, and that is small businesses, the 
backbone of our economy where most 
people work. Specifically, I want to 
focus on how these small businesses are 
going to be hurt by the specific tax 
issues that are being proposed. 
Small businesses are generally de-
fined as having 500 or fewer employees 
and make up about 99 percent of our 
companies in America. There are some 
really big companies, but when you 
look at the small businesses, they are, 
by far, the vast majority of our busi-
nesses—about 32 million of them. They 
employ over half of the U.S. workforce, 
and they account for nearly two-thirds 
of all jobs created in the United States 
since 2000. Now, that is according to 
the Small Business Administration. 
So more than half the employees are 
there, but they actually are responsible 
for creating more jobs than big busi-
nesses. Think about it. Small busi-
nesses are more agile. It tends to be 
the startup businesses. It tends to be 
businesses that are hiring more people. 
So small business is really important. 
It is the backbone to our economy. 
I grew up in one of those small busi-
nesses. When I was a kid, my dad left 
his job as a salesman for a bigger com-
pany, where he had healthcare and the 
benefits that come with that. And he 
sort of put it all at risk to start his 
own business. 
He started off with five employees. 
My mom was the bookkeeper. They 
lost money the first few years, like a 
lot of small businesses do, but he hung 
in there. And my brother worked there 
and my sister worked there and I 
worked there. I worked on the shop’s 
floor. I did the maintenance. 
It was a lift truck—forklift truck 
dealership, so we would grind down the 
lift trucks and paint them. And I 
learned how not just to work hard but 
learned how a small business can suc-
ceed. And it is not easy. 
After losing money the first few 
years, my dad found his niche and be-
came a successful small business. My 
brother later took the business to an 
even higher level, but it was still a 
small business that struggled depend-
ing on what was happening in the econ-
omy, external factors they couldn’t 
control, like every small business. 
It gave me a firsthand look as to how 
difficult it is and how important it is, 
both, to have small businesses out 
there. My dad was absolutely com-
mitted to ensuring the people who 
worked there felt like they were part of 
it, so he had a profit-sharing plan. It 
didn’t work too well when there was no 
profit, but once there was profit, it 
worked pretty well. And there were 
guys who turned a wrench their whole 
career, lift truck technicians whom I 
have known my whole life, who are 
about my age, who are retiring today 
with a nice nest egg because of that 
profit-sharing plan and, then later, a 
401(k). So I have seen what small busi-
nesses can do for their employees, for 
the local economy, for the broader 
community. 
During COVID–19, small businesses 
have really struggled. It has been 
tough. They have been stretched really 
thin. As I am sure is the case with 
every single one of my colleagues here 
in the U.S. Senate, I have heard from a 
lot of small business owners across my 
home State of Ohio who have told me 
about the issues that they faced due to 
shutdowns, due to people being sick, 
due to the very difficult job right now 
of just getting workers to come to the 
business and to stay in the business. 
Workforce problems are the No. 1 issue 
I now hear about back home. 
And due to the supply chain disrup-
tions, taking longer and longer to get 
products and products having a higher 
and higher price due to the inflation 
that is reflected in that, it is tough 
right now. Despite these hardships, a 
lot of the small businesses I know have 
made it a real priority to ensure they 
are taking care of their people. 
We helped them do that here through 
the PPP program, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program. I strongly support it 
because I have seen it work. I have 
seen employees be able to stick around 
through the worst of COVID and now 
be able to come back to work. 
We have got another surge going on 
right now in my home State and 
around the country with the Delta var-
iant, but we are learning better how to 
keep people at work and how to ensure 
that folks are taken care of. Often 
these small business owners have done 
this out of their own pockets; in other 
words, they have lost money during the

COVID period in order to keep the busi-
ness going. And if they can afford to do 
that, great; they can keep the doors 
open. Some have not been able to do 
that, and they have had to close their 
doors. 
So this is a time when there is a lot 
of uncertainty out there in the econ-
omy. It is a time when businesses have 
kind of been through the roller coaster 
of COVID. It is not the time to raise 
taxes on small businesses. 
Back in 2017, Congress had the value 
of these small businesses in mind when 
we wrote the historic Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act reforms. Through provisions 
like lowering the individual rate of 
taxation and enacting what is called 
the section 199A deduction, we gave 
small businesses needed tax relief and 
encouraged them to invest in growing 
their operations, hiring more workers, 
lifting wages. 
And it worked. The success of small 
businesses in 2018 and 2019, before 
COVID and after the 2017 bill was put 
into effect, was truly extraordinary. In 
February of 2020, just before COVID 
hit, we had the 19th straight month of 
wage increases of 3 percent or more on 
an annual basis. Nineteen straight 
months we had wages going up. 
Isn’t that what we all wanted? That 
was the whole idea, to have an oppor-
tunity economy where people can get 
ahead. And wages were going up faster 
than inflation, which, unfortunately, is 
not the case now. In many instances, 
even when people are getting some 
wage gains right now, with 5 percent- 
plus inflation, it is eating it up. 
We also had a situation back then 
where we had not just wage growth but 
we had a reduction in poverty. We had 
the lowest poverty rate since we start-
ed keeping track of it back in the 1950s, 
prior to COVID. I think a lot of it was 
because 
those 
tax 
cuts 
actually 
worked. And, again, for a small busi-
ness, it is really important because 
that is where most people are em-
ployed. 
We also had the lowest unemploy-
ment in 50 years in this country and 
the lowest unemployment ever for cer-
tain groups, including Blacks, His-
panics, the disabled. So a lot of stuff 
was going right. Then COVID hit. 
Now we are coming out of COVID. 
Again, the wrong time to raise taxes. 
That Tax Code we put in place in 2017 
gave small business the chance to suc-
ceed and, therefore, gave a lot of indi-
viduals the chance to meet their Amer-
ican dream. 
The overall economy has improved 
some since 2020, but a lot of small busi-
nesses have not seen that rebound yet. 
COVID, particularly, has hurt our hos-
pitality sector. I am in that business. 
My family business is in that business 
as well. It is tough. 
The travel business, entertainment 
business, and every small business, 
again, that I know has been hit with 
higher inflation for their input. So 
things are more expensive coming in, 
and yet it is hard to be able to raise 
your prices, so they are caught in a 
squeeze. Finding workers again has 
been a real change—the supply chain 
issues we have talked about. 
So why would Democrats propose bil-
lions in tax hikes on small businesses 
right now? 
We ought to be helping our small 
businesses instead, not making it hard-
er to stay afloat. Remember, as I said, 
these are the biggest tax increases we 
have had in over 50 years. 
Democrats claim they are just going 
after large corporations, but, unfortu-
nately, that is not what is happening. 
A lot of small businesses are going to 
be caught in the crosshairs of the in-
come tax hikes that Democrats are 
proposing. That is primarily because 
about 95 percent of small businesses op-
erate as what is called pass-throughs. 
The vast, vast majority of small busi-
nesses are partnerships, sole propri-
etorships, or companies that are lim-
ited liability companies with sub-
chapter S companies. So the business 
doesn’t pay the taxes directly. The tax 
is actually paid by the owners of the 
business, on their 1040—individual tax 
return. 
What that means is that success of 
pass-throughs, which combine to em-
ploy about 58 percent of the Nation’s 
workforce, will be taxed in line with 
whatever the income tax level is. And 
there are many reasonably successful 
pass-throughs that will be lumped into 
the top bracket of the Tax Code, which 
starts at $400,000 in income. 
These small businesses, through the 
owner, will end up paying a 39.6 percent 
increase tax, plus a 3.8 percent surtax 
on small business income. You add to 
that the average State income tax of 
about 5 percent, and that puts the fig-
ure for small businesses at about 48 
percent on average—and well over 50 
percent in some States—48 percent 
taxes. That is tough. And it is a big tax 
increase for a lot of those businesses. 
Again, they are pass-through busi-
nesses, so the owners are the ones who 
pay the taxes. 
If they weren’t paying the taxes, they 
wouldn’t often get a dividend from the 
company to pay those taxes; they 
would be investing more in that busi-
ness. So it hurts the businesses di-
rectly. But a pass-through doesn’t even 
have to reach that level of success we 
talked 
about—the 
$400,000 
income 
level—in order to be hit with tax in-
creases. That is because, contrary to 
what has repeatedly been said by the 
Biden administration, according to the 
nonpartisan Joint Committee on Tax-
ation analysis of the House Ways and 
Means, Democratic tax proposal, a lot 
of taxpayers making less than $400,000 
are going to see higher taxes. Some 
percentage of taxpayers in every in-
come bracket will see their rates go up, 
even folks making between 40,000 and 
50,000 bucks per year. Check out the 
analysis yourself. You can go online, 
Joint Committee on Taxation, and 
look at it. 
In fact, according to these distribu-
tion tables by the Joint Committee on 
Taxation, more than one in three tax-
payers making between $100,000 and 
$200,000 per year will be paying higher 
taxes in 2023. By 2031, more than three- 
quarters of those middle-income tax-
payers—between 100- and 200,000 bucks 
a year—will be paying higher taxes. 
Remember, again, this is not just a 
tax on individuals; it is a tax on small 
businesses that are taxed through indi-
viduals. 
On top of that, Democrats want to 
cap the invaluable 20-percent deduction 
on qualified business income that was 
designed to help pass-throughs compete 
with larger C corporations. 
Again, in 2017, not only lowered the 
rates to help small businesses, but we 
said: If you are a small business, you 
can get this deduction—this 20 percent 
deduction—on qualified business in-
come. 
And for the small businesses listen-
ing this evening: Watch out. I know 
you have enjoyed that deduction and 
you have needed it to be able to stay 
afloat during COVID. That is now at 
risk. 
And successful small businesses earn-
ing more than $5 million a year will be 
saddled with an additional 3-percent 
surcharge on top, resulting in over 50- 
percent average income tax. That 
means small businesses are going to 
have a harder time hiring workers or 
paying them competitive wages. 
In all, the average pass-throughs 
should expect their Federal tax rate to 
rise from about 29.6 percent—about 30 
percent now—to 46.4 percent under the 
Democrats’ new plan. 
Folks, that is not soaking the rich. 
That is slamming small business own-
ers all across America, as well as their 
employees, many of whom are just try-
ing to make ends meet. 
But Democrats don’t just want small 
businesses to give more of their money 
to the Federal Government; they want 
to make small businesses give more of 
their time as well in the form of bur-
densome 
new 
information 
require-
ments that would bury the IRS in a sea 
of useless information, largely, that 
would end up causing the most trouble 
for small businesses that don’t have 
the lawyers or the accountants and 
other professionals to handle these bur-
densome new requirements. 
Under 
this 
Biden 
administration 
bank reporting proposal, individual and 
businesses would be required to report 
to the IRS inflows and outflows of 
money out of an account—things like 
expenditures and payments. The Biden 
administration proposal starts this re-
porting as low as $600. 
But even at that higher number that 
they are talking about now, what 
would be reportable would represent a 
radical shift in the information re-
quired to be given to the IRS, which 
normally just takes in information re-
lated to income. This wouldn’t be 
about income. This would be about 
payments and expenditures. 
So my hope is that these information 
reporting requirements, which is an ad-
ditional burden on small businesses, is

something my colleagues look at and 
say: Let’s not raise taxes on small 
businesses, but also let’s not increase 
these burdens that will, again, fall 
mostly on the smaller businesses that 
don’t have the ability to handle that 
kind of new information and bureauc-
racy. 
The upshot is that the hundreds of 
millions of accounts with major finan-
cial institutions; e-payment apps, like 
Venmo; and cryptocurrency exchanges, 
like Coinbase, are going to be subject 
to more paperwork and confusion. 
So as an example, if you have one of 
the 403 million active PayPal accounts, 
your personal account information will 
be sent to the IRS and likely result in 
confusion at some point. Imagine try-
ing to prove that the money you are 
pooling together for a vacation for per-
sonal use or for your weekly pizza 
night with buddies aren’t business in-
come. You may have to prove that 
now. 
These small business tax hikes and 
burdensome 
new 
reporting 
require-
ments are just one part of a set of tax 
overhauls 
that 
leave 
no 
stone 
unturned—from death taxes to mar-
riage taxes, capital gains tax increases, 
retirement account tax increases, and 
many more. 
It is no surprise that the president of 
the National Federation of Independent 
Businesses wrote last week that ‘‘small 
businesses aren’t just looking at one or 
two tax hikes under the proposed plan. 
They’re looking at a slew of tax in-
creases that would hit them from every 
angle.’’ 
We all ought to be particularly con-
cerned that Democrats want to over-
haul so much of our Tax Code when 
these economic trends are so uncer-
tain—high inflation, continuing COVID 
concerns, major supply chain disrup-
tions. 
By the way, it now takes 80 days— 
twice as long as it did before the pan-
demic—to move goods from Asia to 
North America. Once goods reach the 
west coast, the wait time for con-
tainers sitting at the docks waiting to 
be moved by train or truck is the long-
est it has been since last summer, in 
the middle of even worse COVID condi-
tions. This is not the time to make 
things worse for small businesses. 
And at a time when tax receipts are 
at or above the historical average, why 
do Democrats feel so strongly that 
America is undertaxed? 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budg-
et Office—or CBO—projects corporate 
tax receipts will climb to $379 billion in 
2023, or 1.5 percent of our economy. Ac-
cording to the Tax Foundation, this 
would be ‘‘a record high in nominal 
terms and nearly matching average 
corporate tax collections as a share of 
GDP’’ prior to the 2017 tax reforms. 
So payroll tax revenue has risen by 4 
percent as well, suggesting that work-
ers are taking home bigger paychecks 
than before. To say that we are 
undertaxed doesn’t seem to be con-
sistent with the data we are getting. 
Again, check it out. The Congressional 
Budget Office has its own website. You 
can learn about this. The Tax Founda-
tion has its own website. You can learn 
about what is going on in terms of our 
tax collections. 
As a share of the GDP, those tax col-
lections will be back up right where 
they were before the 2017 tax bill, in a 
couple of years, if we simply continue 
as we are. 
So the opportunity economy we 
talked about earlier, I think, in large 
part created by the 2017 tax reforms is 
on track to bring historically high tax 
revenues to the Federal Government as 
we get out of this COVID crisis. 
Really, one of the biggest factors in 
holding back our economy at this point 
is surging inflation that is, unfortu-
nately, wiping out a lot of the income 
gains that we have seen. 
But inflation is driven largely by the 
trillions in unprecedented stimulus 
spending the Biden administration has 
pushed on the American people al-
ready. 
Remember the $1.9 trillion back in 
March 
focused—so 
the 
Democrats 
said—on COVID; but, in fact, when you 
looked at it, most of it was not about 
the COVID crisis, but it was a lot of 
new stimulation to the economy—a lot 
of stimulus. 
And at the time, people on both sides 
of the aisle—Republicans and Demo-
crats—who were experts on the econ-
omy said this is going to be problem-
atic; this is just a lot of new money to 
throw into the economy. 
Larry Summers, former Secretary of 
the Treasury under Democratic admin-
istrations and a Democratic economist, 
said this is going to lead to higher in-
flation. He was roundly criticized for 
that by many in the media and many 
on the other side of the aisle. Unfortu-
nately, it turns out he was absolutely 
right. It has led to this high inflation 
that, as we learned this week from 
Chairman Powell of the Federal Re-
serve, is not transitory, as was said 
early on. Unfortunately, this current 
inflation is going to continue at least 
through this year and next year, we are 
told. 
So this new $3.5 trillion in social 
spending is going to add to that—more 
stimulus. The economists call that 
adding to the demand side of the econ-
omy. So you are adding to the supply 
side of the economy; it would be 
counter-inflationary. But you are add-
ing to the demand side, what people 
want to buy—you are adding to infla-
tion. So more money out there to be 
buy the goods; fewer goods raises the 
cost of everything. 
So my concern is we are going to 
drive inflation even higher if we go 
ahead with this $3.5 trillion social 
spending paid for, again, by these tax 
increases that are going to hurt small 
businesses. 
I can’t understand why Democrats 
are so insistent on jamming this par-
tisan tax-and-spending bill through the 
U.S. Congress. 
Why would you want to throw out 
the Tax Code that fueled that unprece-
dented opportunity economy we saw 
prior to the COVID pandemic? 
I know none of my Republican col-
leagues are going to support these tax 
hikes because they believe they would 
be devastating to small businesses and 
to our economy at large. And I would 
urge any of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who care about our 
long-term economic health to take a 
long look at what this tax plan would 
actually do, what it would mean to our 
competitiveness, what it would mean 
to individuals and families, what it 
would mean to small businesses, and 
instead make the smart choice to re-
ject these tax increases on the small 
businesses—the very small businesses 
that drive the economy in the United 
States of America. 
I yield back my time.

f 
HONDURAS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to 
speak briefly about the recent decision 
by the National Jurisdiction Sen-
tencing Court in Honduras to acquit 
Honduran nationals Edwin Espinal and 
Raul Alvarez. Both men were found to 
have been falsely accused of aggra-
vated property damage, aggravated 
arson, and the use of homemade explo-
sives, charges for which it turned out 
the government had no credible evi-
dence. 
Espinal and Alvarez spent 19 months 
in a maximum-security prison awaiting 
trial. They were reportedly subjected 
to harsh conditions, including receiv-
ing only 2 hours of sunlight per month. 
Despite 
being 
accused 
of 
common 
crimes, special courts created to try 
members of organized criminal net-
works presided over the process, in-
cluding a judge located at a military 
base. It took 4 years for a court to rule 
on their case and to finally absolve 
them of charges that were determined 
to be without merit. 
Espinal and Alvarez, like dozens of 
other protesters, were arrested during 
the 2017 electoral turmoil that cul-
minated in the reelection of current 
President Juan Orlando Hernandez. 
Their case was used as a means to si-
lence protesters and stifle discussion of 
the democratic process and the need 
for transparent elections. 
Edwin Espinal is a human rights de-
fender who has faced political persecu-
tion since 2009. He is not alone. Many 
human rights and environmental de-
fenders, as well as independent journal-
ists in Honduras, have suffered threats, 
arbitrary arrests, beatings, and assas-
sinations by Honduran police or others 
acting on their behalf. 
I and others here have repeatedly 
voiced our concerns with the Honduran 
Government’s misuse of the judicial 
process to silence dissent. Bringing 
charges with no credible evidence and 
holding social activists and other crit-
ics in prison and subjecting them to 
lengthy criminal processes undermines 
due process and erodes public con-
fidence in the integrity of the police 
and the courts. 
I am also concerned with the lack of 
due process in the case of the eight im-
prisoned 
water 
defenders 
from 
Guapinol that has dragged on for years. 
And like many, I am waiting for the of-
ficial sentencing hearing of Roberto 
David Castillo, the convicted coauthor 
of the murder of Honduran environ-
mentalist 
and 
indigenous 
activist, 
Berta Cceres. 
With another election just around 
the corner in Honduras, I urge the Hon-
duran Government to support a free 
and fair electoral process, as well as 
freedom of expression, association, and 
assembly for all Honduran citizens. 
And I hope that the Honduras’ next 
leaders will reject the corrupt prac-
tices and impunity of the past and sup-
port an independent judiciary, uphold 
the rule of law, hold the police and 
other public officials accountable when 
they abuse their authority, and restore 
the faith of the Honduran people in 
government of the people, by the peo-
ple, and for the people.

TRIBUTE TO ELLE PURRIER ST. 
PIERRE 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it was 
with great pride that Americans across 
the country tuned in this summer for 
the return of the Olympic Games. I 
want to take a moment to celebrate 
the achievements of one Vermonter 
who traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to rep-
resent our Nation—and our State—in 
these celebrated games. Elle Purrier 
St. 
Pierre 
represented 
the 
United 
States in the 1500-meter run at the 2020 
Olympic Games. This was Elle’s first 
turn as an Olympian, and she certainly 
made her mark, qualifying for the final 
in the 1500-meter, in which she crossed 
the line in 10th place. 
Elle is a Vermonter in the truest 
sense of the word. She grew up working 
on her family’s dairy farm in Mont-
gomery Center, a town of less than 800 
people along the Canadian border. Dur-
ing her freshman year of high school, 
she stumbled onto the Richford High 
School track team, initially skeptical 
of long-distance running. Nonetheless, 
her raw talent and grit quickly became 
clear, and she went on to become one of 
the most decorated high school runners 
in State history. 
In college, she ran for the University 
of New Hampshire, where she garnered 
11 NCAA Division One All-American ti-
tles and a championship victory in the 
indoor mile her senior year. Upon grad-
uation in 2018, Elle signed with New 
Balance to run professionally. Al-
though she has only run professionally 
for 3 years, she has set new national 
records in the indoor 1-mile and 2-mile 
distances. 
In June, Elle won the 1500-meter at 
the U.S. Olympic Trials, breaking the 
Olympic Trial record and securing her 
spot on the U.S. Olympic team in the 
process. Elle sailed through the quali-
fying rounds of the 1500, made it 
through to the finals where she com-
peted against the strongest and fastest 
runners in the world. While her friends 
and family could not join her in Tokyo, 
they and so many others gathered in 
the Richford High School cafeteria in 
the early hours of the morning to 
watch each of her races live. 
Even as her success as a professional 
runner has taken her across the globe, 
her Vermont roots remain strong. Elle 
still considers Montgomery Center her 
home, where she lives with her hus-
band, Jamie, who is also a dairy farm-
er. On September 25, Elle was cele-
brated at a welcome home parade 
through the town of Richford. Throngs 
of fans cheered her on as she took her 
well-deserved victory lap. 
It is hard to overstate how proud we 
Vermonters are of Elle. She is only the 
second Vermonter to compete in the 
Olympics for track and field. At only 
26, I am sure we will see more from Elle 
in the future. I am very excited how 
Elle continues to perform in the years 
to come. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
ticle ‘‘Welcome Home, Elle! Richford 
Community Hosts Parade in Honor of 
Home-Town Olympian Elle Purrier St. 
Pierre,’’ published in the St. Albans 
Messenger, be printed in the RECORD. 
WELCOME HOME ELLE! RICHFORD COMMUNITY 
HOSTS PARADE
IN HONOR
OF HOME-TOWN 
OLYMPIAN ELLE PURRIER ST. PIERRE 
(By Ruthie LaRoche) 
On Saturday, Sept. 25, Elle Purrier St. 
Pierre walked beneath the American Flag, 
hoisted high on the Richford Volunteer Fire 
Department’s ladder truck as part of a Wel-
come Home parade held in her honor. 
This 
August, 
Purrier 
St. 
Pierre 
rep-
resented the United States of America, rac-
ing in the women’s 1500 meter at the 2021 
Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. 
Purrier St. Pierre walked just steps behind 
a white and red heifer draped in the Stars 
and Stripes, the community she represented 
with pride, cheering and waving as she 
passed. 
A little while later, Purrier St. Pierre 
stood on a podium, the crowd of parade-goers 
now encircling her, listening in rapt atten-
tion as she spoke of her journey to the Olym-
pic stage. 
Many knew her story well, but I’m sure 
there were portions very few knew, and it 
was the unknown story that made the com-
munity support so much more special. 
‘‘Representing the United States of Amer-
ica on the Olympic and world stage has been 
one of the highest honors of my life so far,’’ 
said Purrier St. Pierre. 
‘‘Competing at the Olympics is the epitome 
of sports, and wearing those three letters 
(USA) across my chest was one of the best 
feelings I’ve ever had.’’ 
PURRIER
ST. PIERRE
SPOKE
OF
HER
TIME
IN 
TOKYO
AND
THE
THOUGHTS
OF
HOME
THAT 
BUOYED HER UP FROM HALF A WORLD AWAY 
‘‘These Olympic Games were different than 
most, but they were still astounding and his-
toric. I tried to embrace the challenges 
brought on by the pandemic but found my-
self feeling very isolated throughout the ex-
perience,’’ said Purrier St. Pierre. 
‘‘I spent many days alone since no friends 
or family members were allowed to travel to 
Tokyo. I was trying to mentally and phys-
ically prepare to compete against runners 
who were the best in the world.’’ 
PURRIER ST. PIERRE WAS PREPARING TO COM-
PETE IN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RACE OF HER 
CAREER 
‘‘I knew I had prepared well for many 
years, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say it 
wasn’t extremely daunting. Something that 
helped me regain my courage was remem-
bering the great country, state, and commu-
nity I was representing,’’ said Purrier St. 
Pierre. 
‘‘I was thousands of miles away, but I felt 
the love from this place and all of you. That 
love 
and 
support 
helped 
me 
persevere 
through the games.’’

the Richford fire truck high above Main 
Street, and I immediately began to cry,’’ 
said Purrier St. Pierre. 
‘‘I cannot begin to explain how much your 
compassion and support through this experi-
ence has meant to me.’’ 
As she took the track, Purrier St. Pierre 
thought of the community behind her. 
‘‘I was racing for way more than myself; I 
was racing for all the people that got me 
there and hoping to inspire the next young 
generation in this great community,’’ said 
Purrier St. Pierre. 
‘‘I was humbled to see the Franklin County 
community come together to support one of 
their own; I could read your messages, see 
your signs, and watch in awe as you all 
showed up to the Richford High School gym 
to cheer me on.’’

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE MARIANI AND 
DEVIN MCLAUGHLIN 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize Mike Mariani of 
Spofford and Devin McLaughlin of 
West Chesterfield as September’s Gran-
ite Staters of the Month. Mike and 
Devin are currently biking nearly 4,000 
miles across the United States to raise 
money and awareness for suicide pre-
vention efforts following the loss of 
Mike’s brother to suicide in 2018. 
Three years ago, Mike lost his 16- 
year-old older brother Nathan. Nathan 
was a junior at Keene High School at 
the time and was known to friends and 
family for his sense of humor and love 
for the outdoors. 
In his memory, Mike and his best 
friend Devin launched Pedaling for 
Prevention, 
an 
initiative 
to 
raise 
awareness for suicide prevention by cy-
cling across the country. Pedaling for 
Prevention also raises money for The 
Samaritans in Keene, which is a non-
profit that provides resources, includ-
ing an anonymous crisis hotline, to 
help Granite Staters battling depres-
sion or thoughts of self-harm. 
This cross country bike ride was ini-
tially scheduled for last year, but the 
COVID–19 pandemic forced Mike and 
Devin to change their plans. Instead, 
the pair travelled across New England 
and held socially distanced meet-and- 
greets where folks could share their 
stories about losing loved ones to sui-
cide and help reduce the stigma around 
mental health. On their return home, 
the duo received a warm welcome from 
their community, including a ride 
through town on the top of a fire truck, 
courtesy of the Chesterfield Fire De-
partment. 
Mike and Devin started their long- 
awaited cross-country journey earlier 
this summer. The two are currently ex-
hibiting an incredible show of endur-
ance by pedaling 3,762 miles across the 
entire United States and providing so-
cial media updates to spread awareness 
about the importance of suicide pre-
vention. On their journey, they are 
also sharing their story with people 
they meet along the way to further ex-
pand their reach. 
These two thoughtful, brave, and de-
termined young people embody what it 
means to be a Granite Stater. After a 
heartbreaking loss that reverberated 
through an entire community, Mike 
and Devin decided to make a positive 
impact by spreading a message of resil-
ience and hope, all the while educating 
others about suicide prevention and 
the importance of reaching out for 
help.∑

TRIBUTE TO PATRICK COLLINS 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I recog-
nize Patrick Collins, a pillar of Belen 
Jesuit Preparatory School in Miami, 
FL, for his 50-year commitment to the 
edification of thousands of young men 
in the community. Throughout his ten-
ure, Mr. Collins served as a teacher, 
chair of the social studies department, 
founder and moderator of Close Up and 
Founding of a Nation, tennis coach, 
and cofounder of the overseas study 
program. 
Mr. Collins’ decades of service shaped 
numerous generations of students and 
are evidenced by his students’ testi-
monies. From his students, one can 
learn how Mr. Collins complemented 
their civic education with the values of 
citizenship, patriotism, responsibility, 
and leadership. Ultimately, his passion 
and love for his country has created a 
legacy that has positively impacted the 
Miami community, State of Florida, 
and country at large through the moral 
compass that he worked to instill in 
every single one of his students. 
I admire Mr. Collins’ virtuous char-
acter and am grateful for the fruit of 
his work. I look forward to continuing 
to learn of the impact that his students 
have on our communities and know 
that he serves as an exceptional exam-
ple to educators across the country. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that an article from the Miami 
Herald dated September 23, 2021, about 
Patrick Collins be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The material follows: 
FOR 50 YEARS, BELEN EDUCATOR HAS GIVEN 
FLIGHT TO STUDENTS’ PASSION TO SERVE 
(By Rafael A. Ya´niz) 
Patrick Collins, a beloved and influential 
educator 
at 
Belen 
Jesuit 
Preparatory 
School, will be honored on Sept. 25. Belen 
Jesuit Preparatory School 
‘‘Before you stand up, you must know the 
first word that is coming out of your 
mouth.’’ This was the first piece of advice 
that Patrick Collins—Belen Jesuit Pre-
paratory School’s social studies department 
chair and 11th–grade U.S. government teach-
er—gave me. 
Decades later, I think of his advice when-
ever I am about to speak in any formal set-
ting. 
And I am not alone in remembering him 
and his guidance, for which, after five dec-
ades, he will be honored at Belen on Satur-
day, and most deservedly so. 
‘‘All prayers in the world can be condensed 
into two words,’’ he told me. ‘‘Thank you’’ 
‘‘I’ve tried to instill in students a sense of 
gratitude to say Thank you, when they walk 
through 
Arlington 
National 
Cemetery, 
through the halls of Congress, through their 
cities, to find a niche in their lives to do 
something that benefits another citizen. 
That way, we can continue on to the better-
ment of ourselves and our country.’’ 
Collins’ career has had a lifelong impact on 
generations of Belen Jesuit students during 
the course of his 50 years at Miami’s storied 
all-male prep school, who have applied his 
lessons to make our community and our 
country better. 
‘‘In my era, we were rambunctious,’’ said 
Jose´ Cil, CEO of Restaurant Brands Inter-
national, the parent company of Burger 
King, ‘‘but he set a really high bar and drove 
us to excel—even if you weren’t an excellent 
student.’’ 
Collins’ passion for teaching beyond the 
textbook inspired him to succeed. 
Former U.S. Congressman Joe Garcia 
agreed. ‘‘Mr. Collins’ addition to Jesuit peda-
gogy is the insight that being a ‘man for oth-
ers’ requires you to engage in the broader so-
ciety without cynicism—without hatred— 
but always with an openness to engage in 
critical thought,’’ Garcia said. ‘‘In the ideal 
republic, he is the ideal citizen.’’ 
Carlos Trujillo, former U.S. ambassador to 
the Organization of American States, said, 
‘‘The impact Mr. Collins has had as a U.S. 
government teacher producing government 
servants, very few teachers across the coun-
try have had that kind of impact in their ca-
reers.’’ 
‘‘To this day, I still apply the lessons I 
learned from Coach Collins inside and out-
side of the classroom,’’ said Cesar Conde, 
chairman of NBCUniversal News Group, who 
played tennis under Collins’ coaching. 
‘‘I first began to understand the impor-
tance of a free press and the role of great 
journalism in our democracy while studying 
in his government classes. And, during a 
Close Up Foundation trip to Washington, 
D.C. that he led, I was directly exposed to 
the federal government, which inspired me 
to apply to the White House Fellows Pro-
gram 
years 
later.’’ 
Conde 
subsequently 
served under then-Secretary of State Colin 
Powell. 
‘‘He taught me to dream big and then work 
hard to achieve those ambitions,’’ explained 
Mr. Conde. 
Eddy Acevedo, chief of staff and senior ad-
visor to the CEO of the Wilson Center, as-
tutely observed, ‘‘Anyone who grows up in 
Miami thinks about getting involved in poli-
tics, in government, in public service.’’ 
Former U.S. Congressman Carlos Curbelo 
was one of those students with an innate de-
sire to serve. 
‘‘He provided us with a thorough under-
standing of what government is and how it 
works, the way the system is designed to im-
pede the passage of legislation, and what 
people have to do to overcome those chal-
lenges.’’

Garcia, who lost to Curbelo, added, ‘‘Mr. 
Collins teaches a realistic understanding of 
the political process, but he provides the in-
spiration to make working through that dif-
ficult process an act of service for society’s 
most vulnerable members.’’ 
That sentiment was not lost on Manny 
Diaz, chair of the Florida Democratic Party. 
‘‘Mr. Collins asked us on the first day of 
class if we knew what our rights were if we 
found ourselves on a country road in Ala-
bama and a big sheriff arrested us because 
we looked Hispanic. I wanted to know the 
answer to his question.’’ 
Collins’ influence led Javi Correoso, Uber’s 
public affairs senior manager, to pursue his 
passions. 
‘‘He instills in you that the meaning and 
purpose of public service is not the shining 
moments like running for office or photo 
ops, it’s about rolling up your sleeves and 
helping citizens get a response from their 
government,’’ Correoso said. 
He also credits Collins for connecting him 
with former U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. 
‘‘It was the middle of football season, and I 
needed the 10 points extra credit wiggle room 
in my grade that semester.’’ He was able to 
snag those extra credits by volunteering in 
her campaign office. 
‘‘I couldn’t tell you what political party he 
belongs to,’’ Ros-Lehtinen said of Collins, 
‘‘but he belongs to the fellowship of man. We 
need to clone him. He’s always been a voice 
of reason and commonsense in my life.’’ 
Collins is clear about what drives him: 
‘‘I’m influenced by the experience of my 
great grandfather. He was an Irish immi-
grant who struggled, through perseverance 
and grace, he was able to succeed,’’ he said. 
‘‘I’m a beneficiary of that generation of Irish 
Americans who feels it would be selfish to 
solely benefit from the opportunities in this 
country. I feel like I owe it to him and to my 
family that the notion of civic responsibility 
continues to those I have met through the 
Cuban immigration experience that is Belen 
Jesuit.’’ 
Rafael A. Ya´niz is a Belen Alumnus and an 
attorney and political analyst based in 
Miami.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. WARNER): 
S. 2883. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to allow rehabili-
tation expenditures for public school 
buildings to qualify for rehabilitation 
credit; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today, I 
want to discuss legislation I am intro-
ducing, the School Infrastructure Mod-
ernization Act. 
To claim the Federal tax credit for 
historic preservation, a building ren-
ovation must be for a different purpose 
than that for which the building was 
previously used, a requirement known 
as the ‘‘prior use’’ rule. This bill waives 
that requirement for renovations of K– 
12 public school buildings. This will 
make it easier to restore historic-but- 
dilapidated school buildings across the 
country so our children have safe, mod-
ern spaces in which to learn. 
As a Richmond City Council member 
and later mayor, I faced challenges fa-
miliar to many municipalities: over-
crowded schools, aging buildings, and 
limited dollars in the budget. But in 
one particular case, I and a group of 
local stakeholders identified a creative 
solution. On one hand, we had an over-
crowded Thomas Jefferson High School 
with in-zone and magnet students. On 
the other hand, we had a closed Maggie 
Walker High School that needed ren-
ovations. We put together a financing 
package that made use of Federal and 
State historic tax credits to renovate 
Maggie Walker High School and satis-
fied the prior use rule by consolidating 
the magnet program from Thomas Jef-
ferson into a new Maggie Walker Gov-
ernor’s School for Government and 
International Studies. Today, some 20 
years later, this is one of America’s 
highest performing public high schools. 
Without the Federal historic tax cred-
it, this would have been too expensive 
to make happen. 
This bill will make it easier to do 
similar projects around the country. 
More modern school buildings will bol-
ster the quality of public education, 
and carrying out these projects will 
generate private sector infrastructure 
investment and jobs. In Virginia alone, 
according to a 2013 study, more than 
800 K–12 schools are at least 50 years 
old, representing some 40 percent of all 
the K–12 schools in the Commonwealth. 
As the Senate considers tax reform 
and a comprehensive infrastructure 
package, I encourage my colleagues to 
support this common-sense incentive 
that is good for education, good for in-
frastructure, and good for jobs. 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself and 
Mr. SCHATZ): 
S. 2884. A bill to amend the Food, Ag-
riculture, Conservation, and Trade Act 
of 1990 to provide research and exten-
sion grants to combat plant pests and 
noxious 
weeds 
that 
impact 
coffee 
plants, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Coffee Plant 
Health Initiative Amendments Act, a 
bill that allows the Secretary of Agri-
culture to provide research and exten-
sion grants for the purposes of pro-
tecting coffee plants from outside 
threats such as invasive pests and 
weeds. 
Coffee serves as a cornerstone of Ha-
waii’s agricultural industry, both in 
terms of culture and economics. Coffee 
has been grown in Hawaii for almost 
200 years and is revered all over the 
world for exceptional quality and taste. 
Coffee is grown on every main island in 
Hawaii, with half of the acreage on Ha-
waii Island and the other half spread 
across Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai, 
and Lanai. Hawaii remains the largest 
grower of coffee in the United States, 
with over 27 million pounds produced 
and yielding just over $54 million dur-
ing the 2019–2020 season. 
Like all natural ecosystems in Ha-
waii, coffee production has experienced 
numerous 
threats 
from 
pests 
and 
weeds. These include the black twig 
borer, root-knot nematode, green scale, 
crab spider, coffee berry borer, and cof-
fee leaf rust, to name a few. In response 
to the 2010 arrival of the coffee berry 
borer in Hawaii, I successfully included 
the coffee plant health initiative provi-
sion in the 2014 farm bill. This provi-
sion allowed the Secretary of Agri-
culture to provide research and exten-
sion grants to help the coffee commu-
nity combat the coffee berry borer. The 
resulting Federal assistance provided 
has been instrumental in providing cof-
fee producers the tools they need to 
protect their coffee crops from the cof-
fee berry borer. 
Within the past year another coffee 
pest has emerged in Hawaii, a fungus 
known as Coffee Leaf Rust. Like the 
coffee berry borer, Federal funds are 
needed to research and develop pest 
management strategies to equip coffee 
producers with the knowledge and 
tools necessary to safeguard their cof-
fee yields. 
This bill builds upon the 2014 farm 
bill coffee plant health initiative provi-
sion by expanding the scope of research 
and extension grants to all invasive 
pests and noxious weeds threatening 
the coffee industry, not just the coffee 
berry borer. While our researchers and 
coffee growers are currently battling 
coffee leaf rust, future pest and weeds 
not currently in Hawaii, like the Coffee 
Leaf Miner and Coffee Wilt Disease, are 
likely to emerge. This expansion of the 
coffee plant health initiative will pro-
vide much needed Federal resources to 
help our coffee community quickly re-
spond to the myriad pests waiting in 
the wings. 
This bill is supported by the Univer-
sity of Hawaii at Manoa College of 
Tropical Agriculture and Human Re-
sources, the Hawaii Coffee Association, 
the Kau Coffee Growers Cooperative, 
Kauai Coffee Company, LLC, Puerto 
Rico Coffee Roasters, LLC, and the 
Puerto Rico Farm Bureau.

S. 2887. A bill to codify the existing 
Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partner-
ship Program of the National Park 
Service, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the bipartisan Outdoors 
for All Act. 
This legislation would ensure that 
access to local parks and outdoor 
recreation is equitable and available to 
all. 
The Outdoors for All Act would cod-
ify and guarantee annual funding for 
the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Part-
nership program, which provides grants 
to build new outdoor recreation spaces, 
improve existing parks, and form con-
nections between underserved, urban 
communities and the outdoors. 
It specifically invests in parks and 
open spaces in areas where 80 percent 
of Americans live. Any urban area with 
a population of at least 30,000 can qual-
ify for grants, which can benefit resi-
dents in all 50 States. 
These grants would fund projects in 
park-poor, urban communities, and the 
bill would require the National Park 
Service to prioritize projects that sup-
port underserved communities, provide 
job-training to youth, and leverage re-
sources through public-private partner-
ships. 
As our cities grow and the effects of 
climate change intensify, this bill will 
increase equitable access to the many 
benefits of local parks, from job cre-
ation, to shade and tree cover, to clean 
air. 
Nationwide, 100 million people, in-
cluding 28 million children, do not have 
a park within a half-mile of home. 
That is almost one third of America. 
Additionally, in the 100 most popu-
lated cities, neighborhoods where most 
residents identify as Black, Latino, 
American 
Indian/Alaska 
Native, 
or 
Asian American and Pacific Islander 
have access to an average of 44 percent 
less park acreage than predominantly 
White neighborhoods. 
For example, in Los Angeles, low-in-
come communities and communities of 
color lack equal access to parks; a Los 
Angeles County survey found that 
Compton reported only 0.6 acres of 
parkland per 1,000 residents, in con-
trast to Malibu, which has 55.5 acres of 
parkland per 1,000 residents.

September 29, 2021 
This bill would address this stag-
gering inequity in Los Angeles and 
across the country and make equity 
and justice a key focus of park invest-
ment and planning. 
I thank my colead Senator COLLINS 
and all of the bill’s cosponsors for 
championing this effort with me in the 
Senate. I also thank Congresswoman 
BARRAGA´ N for her steadfast dedication 
to park equity. 
I look forward to working with my

Act as soon as possible. 
Thank you. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 2888. A bill to reduce passenger, 
crewmember, and airport personnel 
risk of exposure to COVID–19, decrease 
the risk of transmission of COVID–19 
on board aircraft and to United States 
destination communities through air 
travel, and protect children and other 
vulnerable individuals by preventing 
further spread of COVID–19 in the 
United States; to the Committee on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transpor-
tation. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the U.S. Air 
Travel Public Safety Act. This bill 
would require airline passengers flying 
domestically to provide proof that they 
are fully vaccinated and also encourage 
more healthcare workers to be vac-
cinated against COVID–19. 
The rise of the Delta variant and the 
latest COVID–19 surge in the United 
States continue to hit hospitals hard, 
and nearly all patients who are hos-
pitalized or dying from COVID–19 are 
unvaccinated. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, surveillance 
data has shown that even after the 
more transmissible Delta variant be-
came dominant during the summer, 
people who were fully vaccinated were 
still about five times less likely to be 
infected and more than 10 times less 
likely to be admitted to the hospital or 
die compared to those unvaccinated. 
Further CDC studies have supported 
that our vaccines remain effective 
against the severe consequences of 
COVID–19. For this and other reasons, 
we must take every opportunity to get 
all eligible Americans vaccinated as 
quickly as possible. 
We know that travel is a significant 
factor in the spread of COVID–19. Ac-
cording to a study published in the 
‘‘Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences,’’ people traveling to other 
counties or States last year contrib-
uted to higher COVID–19 case numbers 
in their destination communities. This 
was especially true during the 2020 
summer and winter holidays. 
As friends and family gathered to-
gether for Thanksgiving, in particular, 
we experienced the start of major 
back-to-back surges that would cul-
minate into the highest daily cases, 
hospitalizations, and deaths reported 
nationally during the pandemic. 
While 
scientists 
aren’t 
expecting 
COVID–19 peaks to reach these levels 
again, hospitals may still find them-
selves overwhelmed if large numbers of 
COVID–19 and influenza hospitaliza-
tions coincide this winter. 
The U.S. Air Travel Public Safety 
Act would add an additional preventa-
tive layer to COVID–19 safety measures 
for domestic air travel. Specifically, it 
would require airline passengers to pro-
vide proof of vaccination before board-
ing a domestic flight within the United 
States. 
The bill would also offer alternatives 
to airline passengers not yet fully vac-
cinated by allowing them to provide ei-
ther proof of a negative COVID–19 test 
result or documentation proving that 
they have recovered from COVID–19. 
Current CDC guidance notes that 
fully vaccinated travelers are much 
less likely to get and spread COVID–19 
than people who are unvaccinated. Fur-
thermore, new research published in a 
Mayo Clinic Proceedings study shows 
that COVID–19 testing requirements 
for airline passengers could have a 
meaningful effect on detecting active 
infections either immediately before or 
after a flight. 
This legislation builds on current re-
quirements in place since January 2021 
that 
require 
proof 
of 
a 
negative 
COVID–19 test result for all airline pas-
sengers, including U.S. citizens, arriv-
ing from a foreign country to the 
United States. Many Americans have 
already experienced this process, and 
airlines are required to collect this 
passenger COVID–19 information on be-
half of CDC. 
When added to current safety inter-
ventions required for domestic flights, 
these measures could decrease the risk 
of transmission during air travel, as 
well as the potential of air travelers 
spreading COVID–19 at their destina-
tions. 
The bill would also require CDC’s Ad-
visory Committee on Immunization 
Practices—ACIP—to 
develop 
rec-
ommendations for COVID–19 vaccine 
use in healthcare settings and among 
health care personnel in other settings. 
ACIP 
currently 
recommends 
that 
healthcare personnel be vaccinated for 
vaccine-preventable diseases, such as 
Hepatitis B, measles, and influenza. 
ACIP’s 
recommendation 
for 
the 
COVID–19 vaccine would further en-
courage health workers to get the shot 
and reduce the chances of spread. This 
is particularly important as vaccina-
tion rates among health workers re-
main lower than optimal. 
This legislation may also positively 
affect vaccine acceptance among the 
general public. According to a poll by 
the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 3 
in 10 people surveyed who were waiting 
to be vaccinated said they would be 
more likely to get vaccinated if air-
lines required passengers to be vac-
cinated. This number increased to 
about 4 in 10 among unvaccinated indi-
viduals who said they would only get 
the vaccine if required. 
We must ensure the millions of air-
line passengers that crisscross our 
country aren’t contributing to further 
COVID–19 transmission. This is espe-
cially critical for young children, who 
remain ineligible to be vaccinated and 
are increasingly accounting for re-
ported COVID–19 infections nationwide. 
I want to thank the Infectious Dis-
eases Society of America for their sup-
port for this bill. Getting vaccinated is 
a matter of life and death, and it is the 
only option to safely returning to nor-
malcy. I look forward to working with 
my colleagues on this important issue, 
and I urge my fellow Senators to sup-
port the U.S. Air Travel Public Safety 
Act. 
Thank you. 
By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and 
Mr. CORNYN): 
S. 2891. A bill to amend title 35, 
United States Code, to address matters 
relating to the Patent Trial and Appeal 
Board of the United States Patent and 
Trademark Office, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on the Judici-
ary. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 10 years 
ago this month, Congress worked on a 
broad bipartisan basis to pass the 
Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, the 
biggest change to the United States 
patent laws in half a century. The pat-
ent system exists to create incentives 
that promote the progress of science 
and the useful arts for the benefit of 
the public. Our whole economy depends 
on a working patent system that rein-
forces high-quality patents while en-
suring that poor-quality patents can-
not throw a wrench into the gears. 
Today, I am proud to introduce, along-
side Senator CORNYN, the bipartisan 
Restoring the America Invents Act to 
ensure that the improvements we made 
to maintain high patent quality in the 
Leahy-Smith Act continue to work as 
Congress intended. 
One of the challenges we confronted 
10 years ago was that too many invalid 
patents were being issued. Instead of 
rewarding true innovation, these pat-
ents were being used to indefinitely ex-
tend monopolies, quash competition, 
and harm American consumers. For ex-
ample, in the pharmaceutical industry, 
brand-name drug companies would ar-
tificially extend a drug’s patent term 
by patenting minor and insignificant 
changes to the underlying product. In 
other industries, entities that did not 
even make products would buy up tens 
of thousands of questionable patents 
covering simple and obvious actions 
like doing business on the internet, and 
they would sue thousands of small 
businesses that sold innovative prod-
ucts online. 
One of the biggest accomplishments 
of the Leahy-Smith Act was that it 
empowered members of the public to 
challenge a patent’s validity at the 
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office— 
PTO—directly, providing a faster, less 
expensive, and more accessible avenue 
than litigation in the courts. These 
proceedings, called inter partes review

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6783 
September 29, 2021 
and post-grant review, have been wild-
ly successful. According to one eco-
nomic impact study, in one 5-year pe-
riod, the Leahy-Smith Act saved the 
U.S. economy $2.64 billion in litigation 
costs alone, with more than $1 billion 
more in added personal income for 
Americans. 
The Leahy-Smith Act’s new pro-
ceedings have been used thousands of 
times and have had the aggregate im-
pact of improving the quality of pat-
ents in our patent system. Unfortu-
nately, over time and especially during 
the last administration, the PTO has 
limited the availability of these pro-
ceedings beyond what Congress in-
tended. The PTO began routinely de-
clining to hear challenges brought by 
members of the public, even when 
those challenges met timing require-
ments, met all other statutory criteria, 
and would have likely succeeded on the 
merits. In 2020, roughly one in five 
challenges was summarily denied pro-
ceedings by the PTO, undermining the 
intent of the Leahy-Smith Act. 
Furthermore, whether a patent is 
valid should not depend on which party 
is in the White House or what indi-
vidual is in charge of the agency. Dur-
ing the last administration, there was 
reported nontransparent meddling by 
the PTO Director in the work of the 
administrative patent judges who were 
making inter partes and post-grant re-
view decisions. While the Supreme 
Court has recently held that the PTO 
Director should have the last word on 
patentability decisions, the public de-
serves to know when decisions are 
being made by dedicated civil servant 
judges and when they are being made 
by the politically appointed Director. 
This bill fixes both problems and gen-
erally restores the Leahy-Smith Act to 
what Congress intended 10 years ago. It 
requires institution of inter partes re-
view petitions that meet the statutory 
criteria and further encourages district 
courts to stay litigation when a par-
allel proceeding at the PTO will re-
solve the same validity issues. The 
stay factors in this bill are intended to 
put a heavy thumb on the scale in 
favor of a district court stay, pre-
venting duplicative proceedings, and 
protecting patent owners from having 
to repeatedly defend their patents. The 
Restoring the America Invents Act fur-
ther imposes transparency. The PTO 
Director must provide a separate writ-
ten opinion when overriding part or all 
of a decision of administrative patent 
judges, and the PTO Director may not 
interfere in any way in the judges’ ini-
tial decisionmaking. The public and 
any reviewing court should get to see 
the judges’ decisions first, before any 
political actor might change the out-
come. 
This bill further clarifies other as-
pects of the Leahy-Smith Act. It clari-
fies the intent of the Leahy-Smith Act 
that the PTO can address, in inter 
partes 
review 
proceedings, 
certain 
clear instances of invalidity: double 
patenting, where applicants amass doz-
ens 
of 
patents 
covering 
trivial 
iterations of an already-patented drug 
or other product; and admissions by 
the patent owner, in the patent itself, 
that someone else first came up with 
the invention. It clarifies that, when 
patent owners want to amend their 
patent 
claims 
during 
these 
post- 
issuance proceedings, the PTO must 
fully examine and vet those claims be-
fore issuing them. Likewise, the bill 
prohibits the PTO from issuing new 
claims to a patent that are essentially 
the same as existing claims, addressing 
the problem of patent thickets. And 
the Restoring the America Invents Act 
addresses multiple related proceedings 
pending at the PTO, specifying that 
the PTO must decide ahead of time 
how to proceed, to avoid conflicting 
outcomes from separate parts of the 
agency. This is in addition to the agen-
cy’s ongoing obligation to make rules 
addressing common situations, such as 
under 35 U.S.C. § 316(a)(4). The PTO 
should study frequent scenarios and de-
termine whether new regulations are 
needed to address them. 
Fundamentally, we need to address 
why the PTO issues invalid patents in 
the first place. But when these invalid 
patents have already been issued, they 
need to be addressed on the back end. 
On this 10th anniversary of the Leahy- 
Smith Act, I am proud to introduce 
this bill—the Restoring the America 
Invents Act, that will restore the pat-
ent system so it can continue to ac-
complish its goals into the next decade 
and beyond, reinforcing high-quality 
patents while ensuring that poor-qual-
ity patents don’t disrupt the American 
economy, costing Americans untold 
sums in unreasonable drug costs and 
overly inflated prices generally. I am 
excited to work alongside Senator COR-
NYN, on a bipartisan basis, to pass this 
important piece of legislation. The 
Founders envisioned the patent system 
to promote the progress of science and 
the useful arts for the benefit of the 
public. It is time to get back to the 
Founders’ vision. I hope the Senate 
will act quickly to pass this critical 
legislation. 
By Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for 
himself, Ms. LUMMIS, Mr. JOHN-
SON, Mr. LEE, and Mr. MAR-
SHALL): 
S. 2895. A bill to prohibit the Depart-
ment of Transportation and other 
agencies from promulgating rules re-
quiring a person to provide proof of 
COVID–19 vaccination in order to en-
gage in interstate commerce or travel, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
the past 18 months have been trying for 
our Nation. 
Thankfully, the vaccine has brought 
normalcy back to the lives of many 
Americans. In record time, thanks to 
the hard work of the Trump adminis-
tration and scientists across our coun-
try, we developed a safe and effective 
vaccine to protect Americans against 
COVID–19. 
These vaccines show us what can 
happen 
through 
cooperation, 
inge-
nuity, and hard work. And I am grate-
ful for all those who helped us get here. 
I got the vaccine and encourage every-
one to talk to their doctor and consider 
doing the same. That is what we all 
should do: give Americans all the infor-
mation and data so that they have ev-
erything they need to make a good de-
cision for their family. 
That is exactly what I did when I was 
Governor of Florida in the face of life- 
threatening hurricanes. I made sure 
Florida families were well informed. I 
went out and made sure everyone knew 
exactly what to expect and how dan-
gerous the storm could be, but I didn’t 
issue mandates because that is not 
what governments should do. 
When I was Governor of Florida, we 
had the Zika healthcare crisis, which 
impacted newborns. Rather than plac-
ing mandates on pregnant women or 
restricting their travel to areas with 
local transmission of Zika, we simply 
informed Floridians, worked to be as 
transparent as possible, and offered 
free Zika testing to all pregnant 
women in Florida. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has gone in the complete opposite 
direction. The White House has tried to 
use the new OSHA guidance to create 
fear; push another round of trillions of 
dollars in reckless, wasteful spending; 
lock 
down 
our 
Nation; 
close 
our 
schools; and kill the economy that so 
many Americans have worked so hard 
to preserve and protect. 
Americans are sick and tired of the 
government telling them what to do, 
and the American people are more than 
capable of making the right choices to 
protect themselves, their families, and 
their neighbors. 
As families and businesses in Florida 
and across the U.S. continue to work 
hard to recover from COVID–19’s devas-
tation, travel is critical to getting our 
economy 
fully 
reopened. 
America’s 
truckers, 
shippers, 
pilots, 
and 
deliverymen and -women play an im-
portant role in delivering the goods 
needed to keep our economy going. Ev-
erything from gas and groceries to 
packages from small businesses and de-
partment stores, they help keep this 
country running. They also haven’t had 
the luxury of working from home. For 
18 months, they have shown up to 
work. They have figured out how to be 
safe without the feds telling them what 
to do. 
But 
the 
job-killing 
Biden 
White 
House is now considering requiring 
those engaged in interstate commerce 
or interstate travel be vaccinated and 
provide proof of vaccination and a vac-
cine passport. 
The Federal Government has no busi-
ness imposing vaccine mandates on the 
American people and our hard-working 
businesses. This proposal reeks of a 
power grab and is another attempt by 
the Biden White House to control

September 29, 2021 
Americans. The Biden administration 
wants to control Americans through 
fear and mandates so the Federal Gov-
ernment is touching every single part 
of your life. 
I won’t stand for it. Americans won’t 
stand for it. They know that such an 
order is an overreach of power. Ameri-
cans should be free to make choices 
they feel are in the best interests of 
their own health and the health of 
their loved ones, and the Federal Gov-
ernment has no business requiring 
travelers to turn over their personal 
medical information in order to make 
a delivery or to catch a flight. 
I believe Floridians and Americans 
across this country know what deci-
sions are best for them. They don’t 
need the Biden administration control-
ling their lives. 
The Supreme Court has already ruled 
that the Federal Government can’t 
force people to purchase health insur-
ance under the Commerce Clause. Why 
would President Biden think he could 
do so with a vaccine mandate? 
In December, President Biden prom-
ised—promised—he would not require 
Americans to be vaccinated or require 
that they carry vaccine passports— 
promise by President Biden. The new 
OSHA order breaks that promise. It 
has been one lie after another with this 
President. 
Today, I am introducing legislation 
which will prevent unconstitutional 
vaccine mandates for interstate com-
merce. I am thankful for Senators 
JOHNSON, LUMMIS, MARSHALL, and LEE 
cosponsoring this legislation and for 
Congressman DAN CRENSHAW, who is 
introducing the companion bill in the 
House of Representatives. 
We are working to make sure that 
families across our country can travel 
freely and businesses can conduct 
interstate commerce without the ridic-
ulous government bureaucracy created 
by vaccine passports. 
This bill would prohibit the Depart-
ment of Transportation, the Depart-
ment of Commerce, and other Federal 
Agencies from requiring proof of vac-
cination or the use of a vaccine pass-
port to engage in interstate commerce 
or travel. 
It protects people like my dad, who 
used to drive a truck and would carry 
goods across State lines. It protects 
the rights of American citizens, as laid 
out in our Constitution. 
President Biden is trying to upend 
our way of life and impose his view of 
health on every American—and I am 
here to say that I won’t stand for it. 
Now, I would like to yield to my 
friends Senator JOHNSON and Senator 
LEE, as they will talk about this same 
bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise 
in support of Senator SCOTT’s bill. I 
want to make a few different points. 
First of all, I don’t believe this admin-
istration or people who support the 
mandates are really thinking the proc-
ess through as to how devastating 
these mandates are going to be on our 
economy. 
Well before the President even an-
nounced his unlawful regulatory initia-
tive, I was hearing from truckdrivers; I 
was hearing from nurses and doctors 
who have already had COVID, who had 
natural immunity, who are looking at, 
for example, the reports, are looking at 
some of the data and science saying 
that natural immunity is 13 to 27 times 
more effective than the vaccine, and 
they have chosen not to get it. 
President Biden promised the Amer-
ican public he wouldn’t mandate this. 
He said: ‘‘I don’t think it should be 
mandatory. I wouldn’t demand it to be 
mandatory.’’ 
His Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, said 
it is not the Federal Government’s 
role. 
I agree. The President also said: 
‘‘This is not about freedom or personal 
choice.’’ 
No, this is exactly about freedom and 
personal choice. 
I have written so many oversight let-
ters to the healthcare Agencies. I com-
pletely agree with Senator SCOTT. I 
was a big supporter of Operation Warp 
Speed. I have gotten every vaccine 
until this one because I have had 
COVID, but the Federal Agencies have 
not been transparent. They have not 
given the American public information 
that we need to make that informed 
choice. 
We need to recognize people’s health 
autonomy. This is their body. They 
should be able to make these choices. 
I want to talk a little bit about some 
of the information we are not getting 
from our healthcare Agencies that peo-
ple who are choosing not to get vac-
cinated are looking at. And it is not 
disinformation. This is real informa-
tion. It is just being withheld from the 
public by our healthcare Agencies, by 
the media, and the social media. 
The first thing I want to show is a 
chart that I put together. Again, this is 
real data. This comes from the CDC in 
terms of the number of new cases per 
day, as well as the number of deaths 
per day. The deaths are down here in a 
very thin red line. But you can see by 
this chart that in terms of the surge of 
the initial Alpha variant of COVID, it 
pretty well peaked late December, 
early January. 
The vaccines got the emergency use 
authorization 
about 
mid-December. 
The orange line shows the percent of 
Americans 
vaccinated, 
fully 
vac-
cinated. You can see the initial surge, 
the initial pandemic, was winding down 
before the vaccines even could take ef-
fect. 
Now, again, we all hoped and prayed 
that the vaccine would be 100 percent 
effective and 100 percent safe. But when 
you look at this chart, as the pandemic 
is winding down, the percent of fully 
vaccinated individuals are going up, 
you would think—again, you would 
think what you would see is just a 
complete winding down of the pan-
demic. But that is not what we have 
seen. 
We have seen this new surge, this 
new surge of a variant called Delta. So 
what are we to make of this? Again, I 
am not a doctor; I am not a medical re-
searcher—but I look at this, and I am 
going, well, it certainly doesn’t look 
like the vaccine has been particularly 
effective against the Delta variant. 
But let’s look at some data, the type 
of data that we are not getting from 
our healthcare Agencies. So we have to 
look, unfortunately, to England and to 
Israel that are more transparent. I 
don’t expect anybody to be able to read 
the figures here. I will give you the 
highlights, but I am showing that this 
is from Public Health England. This is 
one of their Federal healthcare Agen-
cies. This is from their technical brief-
ing No. 23, dated September 17, 2021. It 
covers cases for about 71⁄2 months, from 
the beginning of February to February 
12. What the data shows is that during 
that 71⁄2-month period in England, 
there are about 750,000 new COVID 
cases. A little under 600,000 of those 
were the Delta variant, about 80 per-
cent. The number of deaths associated 
with those 600,000 Delta cases was 2,542, 
which gives us a case fatality ratio of 
about 0.4. 
Now, again, case fatality is higher 
than infection fatality because these 
are actually registered cases, and there 
are all kinds of infections that never 
get registered. So to put this in con-
text, an infection fatality rate for a 
bad flu season is slightly under 0.2, half 
of this. Again, put things in perspec-
tive. 
Now, President Biden—and this has 
been parroted by media, news media— 
said that what we are currently experi-
encing 
is 
a 
pandemic 
of 
the 
unvaccinated. They don’t give us, real-
ly, any data to back that up; they just 
proclaim, pronounce, that 99 percent of 
people 
with 
COVID 
now 
are 
unvaccinated, but they don’t give us 
the data. 
We have data from England. And here 
is the data. So of the 600,000 cases in 
England, 43 percent were with the 
unvaxxed; 27 percent were with the 
fully vaxxed; another 30 percent were 
partially vaxxed or just undetermined. 
But I think what is interesting—here is 
another quote from President Biden— 
President Biden said: If you are vac-
cinated, you are not going to be hos-
pitalized; you are not going to an ICU 
unit; you are not going to die; you are 
not going to get COVID if you have 
these vaccinations. 
Well, maybe that is true in the 
United States. I kind of doubt it be-
cause in England, of the 600,000 new 
cases of Delta, of the over 2,500 
deaths—63 percent of those deaths— 
1,613 people were fully vaccinated. 
Twenty-eight percent were with the 
unvaxxed. 
This is information the American 
people probably never heard. It is infor-
mation, by conveying it, I will get at-
tacked. I will be vilified. I will be

censored. I will be suppressed. It is one 
of the reasons I come to the floor of the 
Senate to reveal this information that 
the American people need to know. 
Let me close with something else 
that certainly nurses know, nurses who 
were our heroes. They had the courage 
and compassion to treat COVID pa-
tients. Many got infected; some trag-
ically died; most survived. Now, many 
of those nurses are treating the vaccine 
injured. 
Let me just quick quote a couple of 
figures from the CDC’s own safety 
early surveillance system—the VAERS 
report, the Vaccine Adverse Event Re-
porting System. Worldwide, from a 
couple of weeks ago—these numbers 
are pretty fresh—there have been over 
15,000 deaths reported on VAERS. Now, 
I realize VAERS does not prove causa-
tion. But of those 15,000 deaths, over 
5,000 of those deaths have occurred on 
days 0, 1, or 2 following vaccination. 
Now, again, it doesn’t prove causa-
tion, but if I were working at the CDC, 
I would be looking at that very closely 
and analyzing those cases. The final 
number, total adverse events, on the 
VAERS system in 10 months, since the 
COVID vaccines have been under emer-
gency use authorization, over 725,000 
adverse events. So, again, I was hoping 
and praying this vaccine was 100 per-
cent effective, 100 percent safe, but 
that does not appear to be the case. 
And I believe this administration, I 
believe our healthcare Agencies need 
to be honest and transparent with the 
public. They have not been. The Amer-
ican people have the right to choose. It 
should not be mandated. We should re-
spect their personal choice. We should 
respect their freedom. 
And I will just close on—I will be 
bringing more information as we dis-
cuss other ways to push back on these 
mandates over the next few days, so 
stay tuned. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, during this 
pandemic, the people of the United 
States have seen the Federal Govern-
ment intrude into their lives more fre-
quently and more completely than ever 
before. President Biden didn’t make 
any pretense about this. He didn’t 
mince any words. He didn’t sugarcoat 
it. He didn’t even try to hide behind 
any veneer when he spoke to the Amer-
ican people. He said: ‘‘Our patience is 
wearing thin.’’ 
This five-word expose of the Presi-
dent’s thinking is deeply troubling. It 
is not the kind of sentiment you ever 
want expressed within a Free Republic, 
not from the Chief Executive. 
To say ‘‘our patience is wearing 
thin’’ might be something that you say 
of a foreign adversary. It might be 
something you say of a subordinate 
within government, someone who re-
ports up to the President. It is not 
something you say of the people—the 
people who, in our system, collectively, 
are the sovereign. 
It is only by the consent of the gov-
erned that our government has its le-
gitimacy, and to denigrate the Amer-
ican people that way is not consistent 
with who we are. It is not consistent 
with our form of government. 
So I find that five-worded mission of 
how he views the American people wor-
rying in its own right. But I find it 
nothing short of horrifying that he—as 
if acting as some sort of omnipresent 
nanny state disciplinarian executive is 
now set to plunge even more deeply 
into everyday lives of the American 
people. 
We are here today to remove one of 
the options from the unconstitutional 
buffet of strong-armed Executive tac-
tics used by President Biden in connec-
tion with COVID–19. Requiring proof of 
vaccination for interstate travel would 
create millions of second-class Ameri-
cans. And it would make all Americans 
subject to a form of government and a 
type of power to which we are not ac-
customed. And that is really ill-suited 
for our Constitution structure. 
The 
Constitution 
itself 
protects 
Americans from this type of action. 
The Privileges and Immunities Clause 
and the Fourteenth Amendment grants 
Americans the right to freely travel be-
tween the States. There is no precedent 
for the Federal Government requiring 
anything like vaccination before trav-
eling domestically. There is no prece-
dent because there is no legitimate 
Federal power in this area to begin 
with. 
It is important to remember that the 
Federal Government doesn’t have what 
we call general police powers. These 
are the basic powers of government 
that are there to protect life, liberty, 
and property and to focus on things 
like health, safety, and welfare. 
You see, State governments retain 
this general police power. Remember 
that James Madison, in Federalist No. 
45, described the powers given to Con-
gress as few and defined and those re-
served to the States as numerous and 
indefinite. 
The Founding Fathers understood 
what general police powers were. They 
deliberately, 
consciously, 
inten-
tionally, and with very good reason did 
not give those powers to the Federal 
Government. 
So as a result, the Federal Govern-
ment doesn’t possess, under the Con-
stitution, the ability to pass laws or 
regulations of this sort. No, in our sys-
tem of government—our national gov-
ernment—this Federal Government has 
to pass only those laws that are within 
these powers that are few and defined, 
those enumerated in the Constitution. 
The President of the United States, 
under 
our 
Constitution, 
does 
not, 
moreover, have any kind of unilateral 
lawmaking authority whatsoever. So 
the power is not Federal in the first 
place. And even if it were a proper Fed-
eral power, which it is not, it is a legis-
lative power that he is trying to wield 
here. Only we can give him that. Only 
we can enact legislation. 
Article I, section 7, makes it very 
clear that if you are going to change 
the legal status quo, if you are going to 
establish policy at the Federal level 
that will carry the force of generally 
applicable Federal law, you have to be 
acting within one of Congress’s enu-
merated powers. 
But more importantly here, under ar-
ticle I, section 7, you have to have pas-
sage in the House; you have to have 
passage in the Senate of the same leg-
islative vehicle, followed by present-
ment to the President of the United 
States. That formula hasn’t been fol-
lowed here. We have no Federal law on 
this as a result of that. We, thankfully, 
got rid of a King back in 1776. We have 
never gone back—never looked back 
and longed for the Union Jack. We 
shouldn’t be anxious to convert the 
Presidency into a type of monarchy, 
even if it is a mini monarchy. 
Beyond the constitutional problems, 
requiring vaccine passports for domes-
tic travel within the United States 
would place a huge burden on not only 
the American people, but also on air-
lines and on other businesses that are 
already hard hit by the pandemic. Mul-
tiple major airlines have already ex-
pressed their concerns with a vaccine 
passport mandate. 
Look, the last thing the American 
people need is more mandates and re-
strictions preventing them from mak-
ing their own reasonable decisions. 
Americans deserve to be able to make 
a living and to be able to engage in 
interstate commerce and to travel 
interstate without mandates making 
them choose between providing for 
their families and undergoing a med-
ical procedure against their will. 
That is why I am fighting President 
Biden’s existing mandate and fighting 
against future intrusions by the execu-
tive branch into the lives of Ameri-
cans. 
The bill offered by my friend and col-
league, 
the 
Senator 
from 
Florida, 
would ensure that Federal Agencies 
cannot attempt to impose vaccine re-
quirements for interstate travel or 
commerce. I am proud to be here in 
support of this bill. I am proud to de-
fend Americans and their constitu-
tional rights. I hope we can protect 
millions of our fellow citizens and the 
American way of life by passing this 
bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
under no circumstances should the 
Federal Government attempt to man-
date these vaccines and require proof of 
vaccination in order to conduct busi-
ness. 
Small business owners who are try-
ing to restart their businesses, families 
trying to take vacations, and truckers 
who are getting back to work shouldn’t 
have to choose between living their

SENATE RESOLUTION 394—RECOG-
NIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF RADIO FREE ASIA AND ITS 
MISSION TO PROVIDE AN INDE-
PENDENT SOURCE OF NEWS TO 
CLOSED SOCIETIES IN ASIA 
Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. 
PORTMAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 394 
Whereas, after the 1989 Tiananmen Square 
Massacre, a bipartisan group of Senators and 
Members of the House of Representatives, 
led by then-Senators Joseph R. Biden and 
Jesse Helms, came together and sponsored 
legislation to create Radio Free Asia, a news 
outlet with a congressionally-mandated mis-
sion to provide unbiased, independent, and 
domestic journalism for audiences in China, 
Burma, Cambodia, Laos, North Korea, Tibet, 
and Vietnam, whose people do not fully 
enjoy freedom of expression; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia— 
(1) was established by United States law as 
part of the United States International 
Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6201 et 
seq.); 
(2) was incorporated as a private, nonprofit 
corporation on March 11, 1996; and 
(3) made its inaugural broadcast in Man-
darin to the Chinese people on September 29, 
1996; 
Whereas Laos, Vietnam, China, and North 
Korea rank amongst the worst 9 countries in 
the world for media freedom in the 2021 
World Press Freedom Index, as based on an 
evaluation of pluralism, independence of the 
media, quality of legislative framework, and 
safety of journalists; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia delivers program-
ming and content using many media plat-
forms, including radio, television, and the 
internet, in the languages of Mandarin, Ko-
rean, Burmese, Tibetan, Uyghur, Khmer 
(Cambodian), Cantonese, Lao, and Viet-
namese, and through English translations 
and content on the website and social media 
of Radio Free Asia; 
Whereas 
Radio 
Free 
Asia 
launched 
BenarNews in 2015, an online news affiliate 
that publishes news and content for audi-
ences in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Malaysia, 
Thailand, and the Philippines that is focused 
on the consequences of extremism and con-
tributes to coverage by Radio Free Asia of 
the influence of the People’s Republic of 
China in Southeast Asia and the expanded 
military presence of the People’s Republic of 
China in the South China Sea; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia in 2020 launched 
online brand, WHYNOT/WAINAO, engaging 
younger Chinese Mandarin-speaking audi-
ences around the world, who are often skep-
tical of pervasive Chinese government nar-
ratives, fostering an open dialogue on banned 
or under-covered topics through probing 
independent-thinking journalism, features, 
and content; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia, consistent with 
its congressional mandate of editorial inde-
pendence, works to ensure that its journal-
ists and services adhere to the highest jour-
nalistic standards and ethics, without influ-
ence or interference by the United States 
Government or any Administration; 
Whereas the Uyghur Service of Radio Free 
Asia has served a vital role by providing an 
independent source of information on the re-
pression and mass detention of Uyghurs and 
members of other ethnic and religious mi-
norities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region of the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas the documentation of abuses in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region by 
Radio Free Asia has helped inform the poli-
cies of the Congress and the Executive 
Branch, including a determination by the 
State Department that the Chinese govern-
ment, under the direction of the Chinese 
Communist Party, is engaged in genocide 
against Uyghurs and members of other eth-
nic and religious minority groups;

the rapid deterioration of autonomy and 
democratic freedoms in Hong Kong by the 
Chinese central government, including re-
strictions on freedom of speech and the press 
and crackdowns on activists, journalists, and 
protesters; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia has been a pri-
mary source of information on Tibetan re-
gions in the People’s Republic of China, in-
cluding on the March 2008 Lhasa Uprising 
and ensuing security crackdown, the spate of 
Tibetan self-immolations, and restrictions 
on Tibetan language, education, religious 
practice, and the display of images of the 
Dalai Lama; 
Whereas, in March 2020, Radio Free Asia 
reported that the Chinese government was 
under-reporting the number of coronavirus 
fatalities in Wuhan province, which was 
later verified by leaked internal Chinese doc-
uments obtained by other news outlets; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia has provided the 
Burmese people with continuous coverage of 
the 2021 military-led coup that deposed the 
elected government and ended 10 years of 
democratic reforms and growth of civil soci-
ety; 
Whereas, in 2017, Radio Free Asia docu-
mented the human rights abuses against and 
expulsion of Rohingya from Burma, whose 
plight Radio Free Asia affiliate BenarNews 
has continued to cover in refugee camps in 
Bangladesh; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia has done in-depth 
reporting on the behavior of the North Ko-
rean government, including the use of forced 
labor, political prisoner camps, activities at 
nuclear testing sites, and internal acknowl-
edgments of the presence of COVID–19 in the 
country; 
Whereas high-level defectors and refugees 
from North Korea have credited reports by 
Radio Free Asia as a factor in their decision 
to leave the country and seek their future 
beyond the North Korean borders; 
Whereas the Lao, Khmer (Cambodian), and 
Vietnamese services of Radio Free Asia have 
reported on high-level corruption of officials 
and leaders, silencing of independent voices 
and journalists, and the struggles of civil so-
ciety, as well as activities by China that af-
fect the flow of the Mekong River; 
Whereas the journalism by Radio Free Asia 
has earned recognition among its peers, is 
cited by respected international and regional 
media outlets, and has won numerous awards 
for its investigative reporting and exclusive 
features from journalistic and human rights 
groups; 
Whereas Radio Free Asia has been unjustly 
targeted by repressive regimes, with its 
websites blocked, its radio signals jammed, 
and its journalists put at risk; 
Whereas Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Truong Duy 
Nhat, and Nguyen Van Hoa, contributors to 
the Vietnamese Service of Radio Free Asia, 
have been unjustly jailed and detained; 
Whereas Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin, 
who have both worked as journalists for the 
Khmer (Cambodian) Service of Radio Free 
Asia, 
continue 
to 
face 
unsubstantiated 
charges; and 
Whereas Chinese authorities have detained 
and harassed family members of the Uyghur 
Service of Radio Free Asia in a campaign of 
intimidation. Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of Radio Free 
Asia on its 25th anniversary as an inde-
pendent news organization chartered and 
funded by Congress with a mission to bring 
uncensored, accurate news to people living in 
closed societies in Asia; 
(2) honors the dedication and courage of 
the former and current journalists of Radio 
Free Asia in the face of threats and adver-
sity from foreign governments and rising 
risks for press freedom in Asia and across 
the globe; and 
(3) commends the continued effectiveness 
and success of Radio Free Asia in its pursuit 
of independence and credible journalism.

several years working alongside Arlington 
National Cemetery, veteran service organi-
zations, foreign allies, civic associations, 
Congressional partners, and private citizens 
to commemorate and educate the United 
States about the Tomb of the Unknown Sol-
dier; 
Whereas the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier 
was intended to represent more than just a 
single conflict, serving as a focal point for 
the United States regardless of race, creed, 
or politics where the people of the United 
States can come together as a single Nation 
to mourn and honor the fallen soldiers from 
the United States; 
Whereas it is essential to remember and 
renew the legacy of Veterans Day, which was 
established to pay tribute to individuals who 
have served and sacrificed on behalf of the 
United States in times of war or armed con-
flict, and their families; 
Whereas greater strides must be made to 
demonstrate appreciation of those loyal peo-
ple of the United States whose values, rep-
resented by their sacrifices, are critical to 
the future of the United States; 
Whereas each citizen of the United States 
has a responsibility to raise awareness of and 
respect for the national heritage of the 
United States and to encourage citizens to 
dedicate themselves to the values and prin-
ciples for which those heroes of the United 
States died; 
Whereas, on October 24, 1921, in accordance 
with an act of Congress, the World War I Un-
known Soldier was selected in Chalons-sur- 
Marne, France; 
Whereas the World War I Unknown Soldier 
was protected, honored, and revered by the 
people of France who presented their na-
tion’s highest award for valor upon this un-
known warrior from the United States; 
Whereas, on October 25, 1921, the World 
War I Unknown Soldier began the final dif-
ficult journey home aboard the historic USS 
Olympia through the remnants of 2 hurri-
canes;

War I Unknown Soldier arrived at the his-
toric Washington Navy Yard in Washington, 
D.C. and lay in state at the United States 
Capitol;

Tomb of the Unknown Soldier after being 
conferred the Medal of Honor and other med-
als of valor from allies of the United States; 
Whereas, on May 15, 1958, the Korean War 
Unknown Soldier was selected at the Na-
tional Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in 
Hawaii, to represent all of the fallen and 
missing from that war; 
Whereas, on May 26, 1958, the World War II 
Unknown Soldier was selected at sea aboard 
the USS Canberra off of the coast of the 
State of Virginia, to represent all of the fall-
en and missing from that war; 
Whereas, on May 30, 1958, the World War II 
and Korean War Unknown Soldiers were bur-
ied in individual crypts next to the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier after having the Medal 
of Honor conferred upon them; 
Whereas, on May 17, 1984, the Vietnam War 
Unknown Soldier was designated at Pearl 
Harbor, Hawaii to represent all of the fallen

Unknown Soldier was buried in an individual 
crypt, between the World War II and Korean

Unknown Soldier was disinterred and later 
identified as Captain Michael J. Blassie, and 
buried under his own name at the Jefferson 
Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis, 
Missouri; 
Whereas on National POW/MIA Recogni-
tion Day on September 17, 1999, the empty 
Vietnam War Unknown Soldier crypt was re-
dedicated to ‘‘Honoring and Keeping Faith 
with America’s Missing Servicemen’’ as a re-
minder of the commitment of the Armed 
Forces to fullest possible accounting of miss-
ing service members; 
Whereas the United States Army has pro-
vided Sentinels at the Tomb of the Unknown 
Soldier since March 25th, 1926, and main-
tained a constant 24-hour vigil since mid-
night July 2nd, 1937; and 
Whereas the Guards at the Tomb of the Un-
known Soldier are responsible for maintain-
ing the highest standards of the military of 
the United States while keeping a constant 
vigil at this national shrine, and have a spe-
cial duty to prevent any desecration or dis-
respect directed towards the Tomb of the Un-
known Solder: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

September 29, 2021 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 1ST 
SERGEANT CHRISTOPHER COFFIN 
HON. TOM MALINOWSKI 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize 1st Sergeant Christopher 
Coffin, who tragically lost his life serving his 
country during Operation Iraq Freedom. 
1st Sergeant Chris Coffin was assigned to 
the 352nd Civil Affairs Battalion when the ve-
hicle he was traveling in was forced off the 
road by insurgents on July 1, 2003. He died 
that day protecting a convoy that had travelled 
from Kuwait to Baghdad. 
Sgt. Coffin was born in Branchburg, New 
Jersey in 1951 and spent most of his child-
hood there. In 1978, while attending Rider 
University in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, he 
met his wife, Betsy. The two of them shared 
a love for the outdoors, and would frequently 
travel together to ski the Rocky Mountains. 
Chris was also a National Park Ranger, 
serving at Gettysburg National Military Park, 
Pennsylvania and at Mount Rainier National 
Park, Washington. At Mount Rainier, he was a 
climbing ranger and was responsible for sav-
ing the lives of many injured or trapped visi-
tors. He took such pride in the daily raising 
and lowering of our nation’s flag at the Para-
dise Ranger Station that his friends, even to 
this day, remember the huge smile beaming 
on Chris’ face as he walked to the flagpole. 
Chris was a loving husband, a proud serv-
iceman who always took care of his soldiers, 
a National Park Ranger who led search and 
rescue missions to save the lives of park visi-
tors, and a friend to everyone who was fortu-
nate to have met him. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
recognizing the life of 1st Sergeant Chris-
topher Coffin.

Taiwan serves as a beacon of freedom and 
an indispensable strategic partner of the 
United States in the Indo-Pacific, and the spe-
cial people-to-people relationships further en-
rich our lives every day. A few examples of 
these rewarding ties include: 
Trade in U.S. goods and services with Tai-
wan was nearly $104 billion in 2019. 
Trade and investment with Taiwan support 
over 373,000 American jobs. 
Taiwan is the seventh largest source of 
international students in the U.S., and 
Taiwan is my state of South Carolina’s tenth 
largest export market with billion-dollar invest-
ments in South Carolina industry creating jobs. 
My lifelong appreciation of the people of 
Chinese heritage was inspired by my father, 
1st Lt. Hugh deV. Wilson, U.S. Army Air 
Corps, 14th Air Force, with the Flying Tigers. 
He developed an affection for the people of 
China while serving to protect the citizens of 
Chengdu, Xi’an, and Kunming in 1944. 
I am pleased that the United States and Tai-
wan remain close allies, and I would like to 
again wish the people of Taiwan a Happy 
Double Ten Day.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF AMVETS POST 114 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize AMVETS Post 114 of Elk 
Rapids, Michigan, for its 75 years of service to 
Veterans, their families, and their local com-
munity. Through their tireless work, Post 114 
has become an indispensable part of Northern 
Michigan. 
As soldiers returned home from the battle-
fields of World War II, many recognized the 
need for a nationwide group advocating on be-
half of our Veterans—in response, American 
Veterans (AMVETS) of World War II was 
founded on December 10, 1944. Shortly after, 
President Harry Truman and Congress offi-
cially chartered AMVETS in 1947. Throughout 
its 75 years of service, AMVETS Post 114 
have worked tirelessly to support and advo-
cate for meaningful policies on behalf of local 
servicemembers, Veterans, and their families. 
From scholarships for local students to orga-
nizing Military Funeral Honors, the efforts of 
Post 114 have assisted thousands of Michigan 
Veterans and ensured the people of Elk Rap-
ids and Northern Michigan honor the service 
and sacrifice of our Veterans. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
AMVETS Post 114 for decades of successful 
support for the Veterans of Northern Michigan. 
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing 
the First District is home to such dedicated 
citizens. On behalf of my constituents, I wish 
them all the best in their future endeavors.

THANKING MR. KEVIN HARRIS 
FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE HOUSE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, on his re-
tirement in September 2021, I rise today to 
thank Kevin Harris for over 37 years of out-
standing service to the House of Representa-
tives as a distinguished wood finisher. 
Kevin Harris first came to the Capitol as a 
15-year-old to work on the grounds crew with 
the Architect of the Capitol on the Senate 
side. He was lucky enough to have an aunt 
who worked for the then Congressman Walter 
E. Fauntroy, who later hired him on the House 
side. He started working with the House res-
taurant system in 1984, which was eventually 
contracted out. He was able to secure a posi-
tion with the Chief Administrative Officer 
(CAO) Labor Room, now known as CAO, Of-
fice of Logistics & Support. Kevin worked for 
the logistics department for three years, where 
he remembers being mentored by Bobby 
Small, Lew Maiden and Steve Janifer, who 
showed him the ropes. 
Later, it was determined that since he had 
gone to trade school, Kevin would be a good 
addition to the finishing shop and he made the 
move when a position opened. Back then, the 
finishing shop not only finished the furniture 
but also moved the furniture between offices. 
Some of his most memorable bosses were Mr. 
Kelleher, who hired him into the shop, Walter 
‘‘Teenie’’ Woodburn and Robert Lee. 
One his most memorable pieces was a spe-
cial gold leafing project he completed with the 
staff on a bookcase for Representative William 
Clay. He had learned this technique through 
special training on this intricate skill. Kevin re-
calls a table he finished for Speaker Tip 
O’Neill, a very special stripping technique 
using the ‘‘old style’’ to strip down the finish. 
The Speaker was most appreciative. Kevin 
was also among the staff who refurbished the 
entire House floor, stripping the chairs and 
seats in the House Chamber, caked with shel-
lac from years of usage. 
In his long career in the halls of Congress, 
Kevin has personally met five Speakers of the 
House—Speaker Tom Foley, Speaker John 
Boehner, Speaker Tip O’Neill, Speaker Jim 
Wright, and Speaker Paul Ryan. Kevin has 
also reflected on the many lifelong friendships 
he has made in his office, including Timothy 
‘‘Tim’’ Magruder and Vincent Plowden, who all 
motivated each other on the job. He has also 
made special mention of his favorite and cur-
rent manager, John Garcia, who came into the 
shop and really heard their concerns, made 
the necessary changes and motivated the 
crew. He felt that Mr. Garcia really cared

about their conditions. Because of the encour-
agement of Mr. Garcia, he had a newfound 
desire to perform his job at a new level and 
credits Mr. Garcia for the changes in the fin-
ishing shop. 
Kevin felt lucky to be able to attend the first 
Inauguration of President Barack Obama, an 
opportunity afforded him since the finishing 
shop worked behind the scenes on the stage 
preparation. 
Another fond memory occurred in 2004 
when an unexpected celebrity made an ap-
pearance on Capitol Hill—musical superstar 
Michael Jackson. He had been summoned to 
a hearing to call attention to the AIDS crisis. 
As he tells it, Kevin and some of his cowork-
ers were standing outside near the Rayburn 
Building in anticipation of his arrival. They had 
almost given up when they saw his motorcade 
pull up right beside the wall near Rayburn. Mi-
chael Jackson got out of the car and walked 
directly toward Kevin, Tim Magruder and oth-
ers, wearing his iconic glitter gloves and 
boots. Kevin was starstruck and barely able to 
speak, but Michael Jackson engaged them 
briefly, shook hands and then he was off. Co-
workers later teased Kevin about being so 
moved in that moment. 
Kevin has witnessed many different events 
in his 37-year career. With a heavy heart, he 
remembers being present on 9/11. He will 
never forget being outside and seeing the 
smoke from afar, which was the moment the 
Pentagon had been hit by a plane. But like 
others, he did not know the implication at the 
time of this terrorist attack and how it changed 
our lives forever. He was also present during 
the anthrax attack, when he and his crew 
were called in to clean all the furniture that 
was exposed to the anthrax. 
Kevin was working when the earthquake hit 
Capitol Hill in 2011. He was in the office when 
the buildings, doors and floors started to sway. 
After the buildings were evacuated, he had to 
shelter on the comer for several hours until 
the building inspections were concluded. He 
was present when two Capitol Hill police offi-
cers were. And most recently, he was at work 
during the insurrection on January 6, 2021. So 
many memories, both good and bad, because 
of his long career with Congress. 
In retirement, he plans to pursue some of 
his hobbies, like boxing on a punching bag, 
traveling abroad, catching up on movies, a 
particular interest, and volunteering with the 
homeless community. He will continue to at-
tend the church in Baltimore where his cousin 
is the pastor, which he has attended since 
childhood. Kevin is looking forward to spend-
ing more time with his wife and daughter and 
including them in his retirement activities. 
On behalf of the entire House community, 
we extend congratulations to Kevin Harris for 
his dedication and outstanding contributions to 
the House of Representatives. We wish him 
many wonderful years in fulfilling his retire-
ment dreams.

PASSING OF MR. JOHN HENRY 
LYLES, III 
HON. MIKE JOHNSON 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speak-
er, in honoring the late John Henry Lyles, III, 
we recognize and celebrate his life well-lived 
yet cut far too short. 
‘‘Jay,’’ as he was affectionately called by 
friends, 
was 
a 
Louisianan 
through 
and 
through. He was born and raised in the beau-
tiful town of Minden in Louisiana’s Fourth Con-
gressional District. He later made his way 
down to Baton Rouge where he graduated 
from LSU and earned a Master’s degree in 
Public Administration. Jay was passionate 
about his alma mater, LSU, and especially its 
football program. 
Jay was known for always dedicating him-
self to those around him and accomplishing 
what he set his mind to. He loved his family, 
and all who knew him can testify to his excep-
tional character, drive, and kindness. He had 
many roles: friend, family man, entrepreneur, 
marketing guru, political consultant, and ac-
complished writer, to name a few. 
Louisiana is home to some of the most tal-
ented, most charitable, and most outstanding 
people in the nation. Jay’s deep love for the 
state and his willingness to serve those 
around him are what he will be remembered 
most for. He was a good friend of mine—and 
of countless many others. 
Jay will be missed, but he will never be for-
gotten.

GLEN KELLER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Glen Keller for his decades 
of service to the Colorado Westernaires orga-
nization. 
For almost forty years, Glen has served as 
President of the Colorado Westernaires, a 
local non-profit which provides training in 
western riding, precision drills and horse care 
for local youth ranging from 9 to 19 years old. 
A lifelong resident of Colorado, Glen moved to 
Jefferson County in 1964. He started a law 
practice and in 1983 joined the Westernaires 
organization. During his decades of service, 
he has inspired and mentored thousands of 
young adults as they learn the values of the 
organization including leadership, self-respect 
and 
personal 
responsibility 
through 
horsemanship, western heritage and commu-
nity belonging. 
Previously, Glen served on the board of the 
National Western Stock Show and Rodeo 
which the Westernaires competes in every 
year. 
In 
addition 
to 
his 
service 
to 
the 
Westernaires community, Glen is a loving hus-
band and loving father. He has been married 
to his wife Liz for over 55 years, the proud fa-
ther of two daughters, and a devoted grand-
father to five grandchildren. 
I have had the opportunity to meet with 
Glen and participate in Westernaires events 
on several occasions and I have been inspired 
by his contribution to the organization. I wish 
Glen all the best and send gratitude for his 
service to our community and to the State of 
Colorado. 
RECOGNIZING THOMAS HARPER 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and recognize Thomas Harper, a 
Title 10 AGR Functional Area–59 qualified 
Major assigned to the Army National Guard 
G–5 as a Strategic Planner. 
Mr. Harper began his service to our country 
at the age of 17 as an Infantryman in the Flor-
ida Army National Guard. He served 19 years 
in the Army at the tactical, operational, and 
strategic levels as a paratrooper, combat vet-
eran, and qualified strategist. Mr. Harper 
served in units including infantry regiments, 
airborne special forces, the National Guard 
Bureau, the Department of the Army, the 
United States Special Operations Command, 
and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He 
completed five operational tours in Afghani-
stan, Africa, and Central America. 
Before returning to the Army National Guard 
G–5, Thomas Harper demonstrated his com-
mitment to building and maintaining strong re-
lationships between the Army and the legisla-
tive branch. Mr. Harper held the MILCON port-
folio in the Readiness branch of the Programs 
Division at the Department of the Army’s Of-
fice of the Chief Legislative Liaison from 2018 
to 2020. In his work, Mr. Harper worked close-
ly with Members of Congress and interagency 
partners. He assisted Army Senior Leaders 
with preparation for Congressional hearings 
and traveled with Members and their staff, as 
well as Armed Services Committee profes-
sional staff members. Mr. Harper was also se-
lected twice as the detail to the Department of 
Defense COVID–19 task force. 
Mr. Harper’s achievements in his service to 
the United States have been recognized with 
countless awards. He is a two-time recipient of 
the Purple Heart Medal and the Bronze Star 
Medal for Valor. He received the French Cross 
of Military Valor at Division level (equivalent to 
the U.S. Silver Star) from the Ambassador of 
France for his combat actions in Afghanistan 
during December 2009. Mr. Harper is one of 
only seven Americans to receive this award 
since World War II. He has also been honored 
with the National Guard Association of the 
United States Patrick Henry Award, the Na-
tional Guard Bureau’s Outstanding Perform-
ance Award, the Georgia Military College Out-
standing Young Alumni Award, and the Geor-
gia Military College George C. Marshall 
Award. 
Madam Speaker, Thomas Harper is an out-
standing Army officer and model citizen who 
has served with honor for nearly two decades. 
It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor 
him here today.

and co-owner of Haney’s Appledale Farm in 
Nancy, Kentucky. 
Just a few weeks ago, we were celebrating 
the annual Kentucky Farm Bureau picnic on 
their popular family farm, and as always, Ann 
was busy entertaining guests and packing up 
homemade apple and peach pies for folks to 
take home. She was always a gracious host 
with shining southern hospitality and the stellar 
organizational skills to keep everything moving 
seamlessly behind the scenes. Ann helped 
carry on the legacy of Haney’s Appledale 
Farm for many years, alongside her husband 
Don. Together, they celebrated 50 years of 
marriage with three children and three grand-
children. 
Aside from her time on the family farm, Ann 
could often be found at the Pulaski County 
Public Library, placing books into the hands of 
our local children, and inspiring them with her 
love of reading. She retired in 2015 after dedi-
cating 29 years as a community relations spe-
cialist at the library, where she also avidly 
raised funding to provide free books to local 
children through her role as past president of 
the Pulaski County Dolly Parton Imagination 
Library. 
Ann was a passionate advocate for edu-
cation, preserving our history and giving back 
to the community. As a board member of the 
Mill Springs National Battlefield Association, 
she helped preserve the historic Civil War land 
in Pulaski and Wayne counties that is now 
designated as a National Monument in the Na-
tional Parks System. Thanks to her tireless ef-
forts, countless people from around the coun-
try will learn about this key battle in southern 
Kentucky that impacted the foundation of our 
country. 
Finally, Ann was also known for her love of 
family and the University of Kentucky Wild-
cats. She was past president of the UK Na-
tional Alumni Association and served a six- 
year term on the University of Kentucky Board 
of Trustees. As we say in the Big Blue Nation, 
her blood ran true blue. 
The sudden and unexpected loss of Ann 
Haney has been a shock to our entire commu-
nity, and my wife, Cynthia, and I extend our 
deepest heartfelt sympathies to Don and the 
entire Haney family. We were blessed to know 
Ann and we are forever grateful for the dif-
ference she made in so many lives.

HONORING 
THE 
‘‘WOMEN 
WHO 
SOAR’’ IN THE DENVER METRO 
COMMUNITY 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize the accomplishments of 
Maria Bales, Heidi Ganahl, and Dr. Shauna 
Gulley who will be honored by the Northwest 
Douglas County Chamber & Economic Devel-
opment Corporation as ‘‘Women Who Soar.’’ 
Each year, the Northwest Douglas County 
Chamber & Economic Development Corpora-
tion recognizes three women in the Denver 
Metro Community who inspire our community 
and are blazing the path for future genera-
tions. 
Maria Bales has been recognized as a 
‘‘Woman Who Soars’’ because of her strength 
in turning heartbreak into inspiration. In 2016, 
while a sophomore at Arapahoe High School, 
her son Nick Bales started Brought to Reality 
(BTR) to bring awareness to teen mental 
health and end the stigma surrounding mental 
illness. Tragically, on September 29, 2018, 
Nick took his own life. After her son’s passing, 
Maria made it her mission to continue Nick’s 
work and fight each day to spare other par-
ents, siblings, and friends from feeling how her 
family did. As a survivor of incredible adversity 
in the face of the unthinkable, she used that 
same adversity to inspire and help others. 
That strength makes her truly deserving of 
such an honor. 
Heidi Ganahl has been recognized as a 
‘‘Woman Who Soars’’ because of her entre-
preneurial success. She is the founder of the 
recently launched women’s lifestyle brand 
SheFactor but is best known as the founder of 
Camp Bow Wow, where she turned a lifelong 
passion for dogs into the largest pet care fran-
chise in the world. She’s passionate about giv-
ing back and in 2013 founded the Fight Back 
Foundation, a charity to positively tackle the 
most pressing issues facing our kids today. 
Dr. Shauna Gulley has been recognized as 
a ‘‘Woman Who Soars’’ because of her exem-
plary leadership and exceptional background, 
knowledge, expertise, and record of success 
in bettering our community. Dr. Gulley pro-
vides strategic direction to Centura Health in 
its mission to build whole person care and 
flourishing communities. Her work focuses on 
optimizing clinical quality and patient safety, 
building world-class clinical service lines, and 
promoting an agile, team-based culture at the 
forefront of all they do. 
From overcoming incredible adversity to 
showcasing exemplary leadership in medicine 
and business, this year’s recipients have 
made a lasting impact on those around them 
and in our community. It is leaders like these 
three women who will allow us to achieve a 
more prosperous and inclusive future and I 
congratulate them all on being recognized as 
‘‘Women Who Soar.’’

IN RECOGNITION OF MARY ANN 
MORAN-SAVAKINUS 
FOR 
30 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
LACKAWANNA COUNTY HISTOR-
ICAL SOCIETY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mary Ann Moran-Savakinus for 
her 30 years of service to the Lackawanna 
County Historical Society. Mary Ann will be 
recognized on September 30, 2021. 
Mary Ann, daughter of the late Francis 
Moran and Joann Schemel Moran, is an 
Archbald, Pennsylvania native. She pursued 
her interest in history at Kutztown University, 
and as an undergraduate, she worked as a 
curatorial intern at the Anthracite Heritage Mu-
seum. After graduating with a bachelor’s de-
gree in anthropology, she was recruited by the 
Museum to catalogue their Hennemuth photo 
collection. Mary Ann also spent time in Iowa 
as an archaeological technician for American 
Resource Group as a member of the field 
crew. 
In 1991, she returned to Northeastern Penn-
sylvania where she began working at the 
Lackawanna County Historical Society as the 
administrative assistant. Six years later, she 
was appointed the Executive Director of the 
Society. Under her thoughtful direction, the 
Society expanded its programming, education 
opportunities, and community partnerships. 
One of the hallmarks of Mary Ann’s tenure 
as Executive Director is her effort to connect 
the Society with the surrounding community 
and promote interest in local history. She has 
invited local artists to participate in Society 
events to create compelling programming such 
as the musical/historical production ‘‘Under the 
Lackawanna Moon’’. She also helped start the 
Museum as a Classroom program which al-
lows local teachers to receive Act 48 credits 
for familiarizing themselves with local re-
sources that are available to their students. 
Mary Ann’s most popular programs are 
tours of the City of Scranton, which bring hun-
dreds of visitors into the heart of the city to 
learn about its history. The Historic Hill House 
Tour, the Places of Worship Tour, and the 
Scranton After Dark paranormal walking tour 
teach visitors about the diverse architecture of 
Scranton and the residents who called the city 
home. 
Mary Ann’s direction has also supported the 
financial growth of the Society, increasing 
fundraising efforts with the annual Taste of 
History event and the successful Capital Cam-
paign to fund the restoration of the exterior of 
the Society headquarters at the Catlin House. 
I am honored to join the Lackawanna Histor-
ical Society in recognizing Mary Ann’s 30 
years of dedicated and selfless service. Her 
vision, commitment, and passion have helped 
foster a love of and appreciation for local his-
tory in our communities, and she has created 
a legacy of innovative programming that will 
be enjoyed by generations to come. I thank 
her for her service to our community and wish 
her all the best.

Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to wish the people of Taiwan and Americans 
celebrating the upcoming Taiwan National Day 
on October 10th a Happy Double Ten Day. 
In the decades preceding and following the 
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United 
States and Taiwan built a strong relationship 
that cannot be broken—a bond born out of our 
shared values and cooperation with one an-
other in times of crisis, and in times of ad-
vancement. 
Taiwan has transformed itself into a model 
of democracy with a respect for human rights,

freedom of speech, rule of law, and a market 
economy. Americans share these core values 
with Taiwan—the foundation of our strong re-
lationship. Taiwan is a multidimensional suc-
cess story and has shown that democracy can 
work in China. 
The United States and Taiwan have a long- 
standing and vibrant trade relationship. Taiwan 
is the United States’ 9th largest goods trading 
partner. In 2020, two-way goods trade be-
tween the United States and Taiwan totaled 
$90.9 billion while goods and services trade 
between the countries totaled $106 billion the 
same year. Taiwan is one of the largest Asian 
markets for Nebraska’s agricultural exports. 
Nebraskan companies have an abundant op-
portunity to expand their business and co-
operation with Taiwan. I will continue to work 
with our friends in Taiwan to find areas where 
we can partner to our mutual benefit. 
This is a day to celebrate, and to be opti-
mistic. I ask my colleagues to join me in re-
committing to a robust U.S.-Taiwan relation-
ship, and in wishing Taiwan a Happy Double 
Ten Day.

HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I’m 
here today to recognize North Texas’ own 
Colleyville Police Department, which won two 
prestigious International Association of Chiefs 
of Police awards this year. 
Colleyville is an amazing city in TX–24, and 
the brave men and women of their department 
brought down a worldwide sex trafficking 
website, saving a 13-year old girl in the proc-
ess. This mission earned them the IACP’s Sex 
Trafficking Case Award. 
In the same year they went on to solve an 
international fraud ring stemming from Nigeria. 
These actions gave them the Elder Fraud 
Case Award. 
The International Association of Chiefs of 
Police, which has over 31,000 members 
across 165 countries, hands out 15 awards 
each year to officers and agencies who exhibit 
leadership, excellence, and professionalism. 
I am immensely proud to represent these of-
ficers in Texas’ 24th District—they have not 
only made our community a safer place to 
Jive, but the entire world.

THANKING MR. BOBBY SMALL FOR 
HIS SERVICE TO THE HOUSE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, for his re-
tirement in September 2021, I rise today to 
thank Bobby Small for over 47 years of out-
standing service to the House of Representa-
tives. 
Bobby grew up in the District of Columbia, 
where he was enrolled in an experimental pro-
gram at School Without Walls. Following grad-
uation, he worked in construction for J. W. 
Bates & Son. It was through family members 
that he heard of an opportunity to work in 
Congress. He was hired by Ed Kelleher, and 
began work with the Labor Force, which even-
tually became the Logistics Group. Initially, the 
Clerk of the House oversaw this work, but 
when the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) 
was established, he began working for the 
CAO. Bobby’s hands-on approach and rapport 
with the staff led to an Assistant Supervisor 
position. He would eventually become the Su-
pervisor and will retire in a Manager’s position 
with Logistics & Support, supervising up to 20 
employees. 
Some of his former bosses include Cosmo 
Quattrone, Jerry Bennett and Walt Edwards, 
to mention a few. Bobby remarked that these 
were some of his favorite bosses and credited 
Cosmo and Jerry for grooming him and help-
ing him to navigate the Logistics world. He re-
marked that they always gave good advice, 
treated him fairly and mentored him. 
Given his long House career, Mr. Small has 
witnessed and been involved in many events, 
notably his contribution during the October 17, 
2001 ‘‘Response Project’’ related to the an-
thrax attack. All Members, committees and 
staff were able to be relocated to an alternate 
location, and Mr. Small and his team were 
among those responsible for all logistical as-
pects of this project. He and his team were 
commended for making it possible to ensure 
that everyone remained safe and that the leg-
islative business of the House of Representa-
tives continued uninterrupted. 
Another big project that Bobby was involved 
with is the ongoing Cannon Renewal Project, 
which began in 2013. It is a 12-year project 
that he and the Logistics staff work on daily. 
While the oversight for this project remains 
with the Architect of the Capitol and the CAO 
Office Design and Move Services department, 
the Logistics group has an integral part to play 
in this multi-year renovation, moving and relo-
cating furniture between offices. 
After such a long career, Bobby has col-
lected many fond memories of his time in 
Congress. Chief among them is meeting the 
Tuskegee Airmen when they were honored in 
the Rayburn Committee Room. He has said 
that the meeting with the late Representative 
John Lewis was one of the highlights of his 
career, noting what an impressive man he was 
and how moving it was seeing the Memory 
Wall in John Lewis’s office showing the history 
of the Civil Rights Movement. 
Years ago, Bobby met with a congressman 
from Cleveland, Ohio to discuss discrimination 
in Congress, making a case about diversity 
and highlighting a lack of opportunity in Con-
gress. Bobby believes that following his meet-
ing with the congressman, measures were 
taken to improve the House environment for 
diversity and inclusivity. 
The list of people he has worked with is 
long and distinguished—too many to mention. 
He has known some of his coworkers for 
many years, including, Lewis Maiden for over 
40 years, Kevin Allison for 35-plus years and 
Steven Janifer, recently retired, who he super-
vised and knew over his entire work career. 
I have met Bobby on several occasions. 
Bobby has lots of hobbies, including fishing, 
hunting and watching sports. He is known to 
have a bit of a green thumb, raising fruits and 
vegetables, an activity he shared with his dad 
on an acre of land. In retirement, he is looking 
forward to spending more time with his wife 
and children and continuing to take occasional 
trips to the Caribbean, Hawaii and Hilton 
Head, South Carolina. When not traveling, he 
hopes to get involved in more volunteer work. 
On behalf of the entire House community, 
we extend congratulations to Bobby Small for 
his many years of dedication and outstanding 
contributions to the House of Representatives. 
We wish him many wonderful years in fulfilling 
his retirement dreams.

CELEBRATING TWILIA MACKEY’S 
105TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to wish Twilia Mackey a 
happy 105th birthday. 
Twilia lives in Monticello, Illinois, and was 
born on October 2, 1916 to parents who spent 
their lives farming in the White Heath area of 
Piatt County. 
Twilia’s education began in a one room rural 
schoolhouse and she graduated from Monti-
cello High School in 1936. She met Stanley 
Mackey while they both attended Centerville 
Methodist Church. They married in December 
1936 and farmed together in the Cisco area 
until they retired in 1993. They were blessed 
with four children, John, Jean, Joyce, and Joe, 
and many grandchildren. 
Twilia has been involved in many activities 
and organizations throughout the years includ-
ing 4–H, PTA, and the United Methodist 
Women & Home Extension, now known as 
Home & Community Education. Locally, she is 
known for her award-winning quilting and 
homemade pies. When asked her secret to a 
long life, she simply says, ‘‘Just be happy 
every day.’’ 
Happy 105th birthday to Twilia, and may 
she enjoy her special day.

THE 
150TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FRIENDS ASSOCIA-
TION FOR CHILDREN 
HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 29, 2021 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the FRIENDS Association 
for Children on their 150th anniversary of serv-
ice to Central Virginia. 
The FRIENDS Association for Children first 
began in 1871 as an orphanage in the historic 
Jackson Ward neighborhood of Richmond, Vir-
ginia. Today, it operates two multi-service li-
censed child development centers in the Rich-
mond area, which offer exceptional care and 
education to children ages six weeks to 12 
years of age in a safe, nurturing, and enrich-
ing environment. A broad array of services al-
lows children to gain critical literacy and devel-
opmental skills needed to succeed in school 
and in life—including family support services, 
developmental childcare, youth development, 
music and performing arts, and health edu-
cation. Through these programs, FRIENDS re-
sponds wholistically to the needs of families,

prepares children to succeed in their academic 
and life goals, and helps children to achieve a 
greater understanding and appreciation of 
their community and the world around them. 
For a century and a half, the FRIENDS As-
sociation for Children has touched countless 
lives through their mission to serve Virginia’s 
children and families. I am grateful for the tire-
less and selfless work of the many volunteers 
and staff at FRIENDS who have provided vital, 
compassionate care to our children and fami-
lies over the years. Their commitment is in-
spiring and deserving of commendation and 
celebration. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the 150th anniversary of the FRIENDS Asso-
ciation for Children.
