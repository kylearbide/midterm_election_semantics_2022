No. 12 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
January 19, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable DEBBIE 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ to act as Speaker pro 
tempore on this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 10, 2022, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for

Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no

f 
AMERICA’S LUMBER CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. HERN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, over the 
last 2 years, the price of lumber rose at 
an astronomical rate. This followed 
prolonged shutdowns of lumber mills 
and production plants, despite the 
maintained demand for lumber for con-
struction projects that continued as an 
essential activity during the pandemic. 
The resulting supply and demand in-
version caused a nationwide lumber 
shortage. 
Our economy struggles when busi-
nesses feel uncertainty in the market, 
which is why it is the government’s 
job, in times of crisis like the COVID 
pandemic, to ensure stability. 
In May of last year, I sent a letter to 
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine 
Tai urging action to prevent further 
disruption in the price of lumber. At 
the time I sent the letter, lumber 
prices had skyrocketed more than 300 
percent over the previous year. With 
the support of nearly 100 bipartisan 
Members of Congress, Congressman 
BRIAN HIGGINS and I asked Ambassador 
Tai to resolve the crisis by resuming 
trade negotiations with Canada to re-
duce the price of softwood lumber. 
While lumber prices temporarily de-
clined following that letter, it took 
months for a meaningful portion of 
those decreases to reach the construc-
tion industry and its customers. Prices 
began rising again in September and 
have continued to increase in the 
months 
since, 
once 
again 
putting 
strain on the hardworking Americans 
who build our homes and communities. 
In December, I once again joined 
Congressman HIGGINS and nearly 100 bi-
partisan Members of Congress to send a 
second letter to the Biden administra-
tion, this time to Commerce Secretary 
Gina Raimondo, voicing concerns over 
the Department of Commerce’s deci-
sion to increase antidumping and coun-
tervailing duties on softwood lumber 
products from Canada. We are con-
cerned that this will further exacerbate 
the lumber crisis. 
The housing sector remains an inte-
gral piece of the U.S. economy. As we 
continue to recover from the COVID 
pandemic, sharp increases in the price 
of lumber will further harm our recov-
ery and the costs faced by hardworking 
Americans. 
It is our understanding that the U.S. 
and Canada discussed this very issue 
last year and expressed mutual interest 
in resolving the problem, but it is un-
clear if any action has yet been taken 
by either country. 
We want to see stability and nor-
malcy restored to the housing market. 
It is imperative that we do so. We want 
to see definitive action from the Biden 
administration to solve this problem. 
Madam Speaker, we in Congress 
stand ready to help in any way we can. 
f 
ABOLISH FILIBUSTER OR LET 
DEMOCRACY DIE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, as 
we come off the historic Martin Luther 
King, Jr., holiday, it is incumbent upon 
all of us not just to reflect on his leg-
acy but to really honor it. 
Honoring his legacy means really 
using our political strength, much of 
which was given to us by him and his 
struggle, to deliver the very voting 
rights protections he and countless 
other civil rights leaders, including our 
very own John Lewis, bled to secure. 
We simply cannot accept empty 
promises anymore, Madam Speaker, in 
pursuit of his dream for a more equal 
and just America, not from Senators 
who have the power to live fully in 
those ideals today and not from Mem-
bers of this very Chamber. 
How can anyone, Madam Speaker, es-
pecially any Member of the Senate, 
celebrate this day of service, Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day, without standing 
for democracy and the rights of others? 
How can they, in good faith, deliver 
empty words or celebrate his legacy in 
the shadow of this current attack on 
access to the ballot box when they 
themselves have the power to stop it? 
But let me step back just a minute 
and put this in perspective, Madam 
Speaker. Just last year, Republicans 
introduced 440 voter suppression bills

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H222 
January 19, 2022 
in 49 States. Nineteen States have al-
ready passed voting restrictions in 
2021, with even more coming this year. 
These are acts of voter suppression 
occurring in nearly every State of the 
Union, targeting Black and Brown 
communities, working-class and poor 
communities, telling them that their 
votes and voices shouldn’t be heard, 
violating the sacred concept of one per-
son, one vote. 
Make no mistake, Madam Speaker: 
The restrictive voting laws that have 
passed and continue to be passed and 
pushed have directly targeted Black 
and Brown poor and working-class 
communities, directly targeting com-
munities of color to make it harder for 
them to access the ballot box and to 
participate in our democracy. 
As we continue to honor Dr. King and 
his legacy today, the Senate has a 
choice: Abolish the filibuster or let de-
mocracy die. 
Madam Speaker, the filibuster is an 
arcane piece of Senate procedure that 
came to be by accident. It is a direct 
legacy to segregation and continues to 
hold back progress on civil rights to 
this very day. 
Its most famous use was against the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, where its oppo-
nents filibustered for nearly 60 days. 
But it wasn’t the first time, and it 
won’t be the last. 
White southerners also invoked the 
filibuster to block a voting rights bill 
in 1891, with many of the same Sen-
ators filibustering again in the 1930s to 
block antilynching laws. 
Imagine that. The filibuster was used 
to block antilynching laws. 
We have a choice, Madam Speaker, 
between having a democracy or allow-
ing racist systems to continue. It is 
simple. The filibuster is a monument 
to white supremacy, and we have to 
tear it down. 
I refuse to hear any cheap excuse 
about why protecting the very found-
ing principle of this Nation isn’t pos-
sible because of it, not when it has 
been changed 161 times. 
The filibuster, in the last five dec-
ades, has been changed 161 times to 
pass trade deals, tax cuts for the rich, 
Supreme Court Justices, and just re-
cently for the debt ceiling. 
But that is not what we remember 
the filibuster for. We remember the fil-
ibuster for its racist roots, deeply em-
bedded in Jim Crow, used to stop 
antilynching legislation. 
Madam Speaker, history will not 
look fondly on those who stand in the 
way of progress. 
f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
ELLEN WELCH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the serv-
ice of Ellen Welch, a crime scene spe-
cialist in Morgan County and founder 
of the Hero Tree. 
Ellen has exhibited an unwavering 
commitment to Morgan County’s law 
enforcement as she works as a crime 
scene specialist and investigator. 
Each year, during the holiday season, 
Ellen takes on the role of lifting up the 
community’s fallen law enforcement 
officers and K9s. 2021 has marked the 
third year that Ellen has spearheaded 
this service to the community, and it 
continues to grow. 
Every year, Ellen, her mom, and her 
niece paint each ornament and write 
the name, death date, and agency of 
each fallen officer. Then they place the 
ornaments on a tree that stands in the 
Morgan County squad room until Janu-
ary. 
Unfortunately, this year was espe-
cially hard on law enforcement. Ellen 
had to get a much larger tree as vio-
lence against police officers spiked. 
Ellen has exhibited a selfless com-
mitment to our police officers, and for 
that, we are very grateful. I thank 
Ellen for what she does and encourage 
her to keep it up. 
RECOGNIZING AVA DORMINEY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
extraordinary student in my district, 
Ava Dorminey, for her work building 
the Students Helping Students Succeed 
mentorship program. 
Now a senior at Savannah Arts Acad-
emy, 
Ava 
founded 
the 
SHSS 
mentorship program in her junior year 
to help struggling students. 
The COVID–19 pandemic and related 
school closures, which proved difficult 
for many students, are what prompted 
Ava to take action. Her desire to help 
students’ mental health and academic 
success culminated in the creation of 
the Students Helping Students Succeed 
mentorship program. Ava wanted to as-
sist her fellow students while also 
working to instill essential qualities 
like confidence, teamwork, and leader-
ship in our youth. 
Her work has been instrumental in 
helping students through these trying 
times. I am extremely proud to rep-
resent a district where young people’s 
work, like Ava’s, is on display for the 
whole Nation to see. 
She inspires me and gives me even 
more confidence in our future, and I 
want to thank her for the work she is 
doing in our community. 
I hope Ava’s story and work inspire 
other young people to find an avenue 
that can help their communities be 
successful as well. 
CONGRATULATING RINCON, GEORGIA 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Rincon, Georgia, for being recognized 
as one of 24/7 Wall Street’s best cities 
to live in, in the South. 
Rincon is a gem of a town in the 
First District that is well deserving of 
this 
recognition. 
Its 
population 
growth, high median household in-
come, and low unemployment rate are 
just some of the features that caught 
the attention of 24/7 Wall Street, an 
independent news organization that 
ranks cities based on affordability, 
quality of life, economy, and commu-
nity. 
Incorporated as a city in 1927, Rincon 
has a rich history as a rail town in the 
1800s. When World War II came to 
America, Rincon, like the rest of the 
First District, answered the call to 
arms. Due to its proximity to Savan-
nah, Rincon citizens were instrumental 
in the construction of U.S. Liberty 
ships. 
Since then, the city has continued to 
grow and flourish into what it is today. 
I know the citizens of Rincon, Georgia, 
and myself are proud of this recogni-
tion. 
As someone whose grandparents lived 
in Rincon, I was in Rincon most Sun-
days every week as a young man. I can 
tell you how proud I am of the city of 
Rincon and Effingham County and the 
tremendous growth they have seen 
while still maintaining a great quality 
of life. 
f 
ENDING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 
VOTING RIGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank you, 
Madam Speaker, for the opportunity to 
stand here this morning with a very 
solemn heart, overwhelmed, one would 
say, with a sense of grief. And in that 
grief, there is joy. 
The grief, of course, is to feel the per-
sonal pain of the lack of unity around 
the very core of democracy, and that is 
the right to vote. 
As has been evidenced by Members 
over and over again, as I listened to 
Senators last night, everyone acceded 
to the point that voting is the core of 
democracy. It means that the indi-
vidual in pain, in frustration, in affir-
mation, in the understanding of poli-
cies, gets to select a person of their 
choosing. It is not about those who are 
elected or candidates or the elections. 
It is about the voters having that 
right. 
b 1015 
Right now, today, in the hands of the 
other body is the crux of democracy. I 
am, frankly, undone by the usage of an 
insignificant procedural rule that has 
been used over the decades and cen-
turies to crush democracy. 
The filibuster is insignificant. It is 
an order. It is not a statute; it is not 
the Constitution; it is not the 15th 
Amendment or the 14th Amendment; it 
is not the 13th Amendment, which 
freed slaves. It is also the recognition 
that voting rights is for all persons ir-
respective of their race, color, creed, or 
religion, and their party affiliation. 
Why is the other body, under the 
leadership of Minority Leader MCCON-
NELL, not coming to the table of unity? 
I extend an olive branch. 
The filibuster has been changed al-
ready over 161 times. Do we recognize 
that between 1866 and 1890 many land-
mark pieces of civil rights legislation

that were essential to protecting the 
constitutional rights of Americans of 
color—this 
was 
during 
Reconstruc-
tion—they were, if you will, voted 
along party lines? But from 1917 to 
1994, civil rights were crushed by the 
use of the filibuster. 
And so I rise today to ask for the bet-
ter angels of the other body, two Mem-
bers who happen to be Democratic Sen-
ators, and others who are in total lock-
step in the other party. 
But listen to William E. Mason say-
ing: ‘‘But every schoolboy in the 
United States knows that the Senate is 
practically 
the 
only 
parliamentary 
body in the world where the majority 
cannot transact the public business, 
and where the minority instead of the 
majority transacts the business of the 
country.’’ Senator William E. Mason, 
April 21, 1897, a Republican. 
I ask for mercy. As someone who 
worked for the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, who had the 
privilege of being here for the reau-
thorization in the mid-2000s, who wrote 
the Coretta Scott bill legislation that 
was added that said no mid-term redis-
tricting, and as well helped rename the 
bill at that time to many icons of di-
versity. 
I want to conclude my remarks by re-
ferring to Martin Luther King’s moun-
taintop speech, to read as much of it as 
I can. He speaks at the beginning by 
saying if he had sneezed when he was 
knifed by a demented woman in the 
1950s, he says, I wouldn’t have been 
around in 1962 when Negroes in Albany, 
Georgia, decided to straighten their 
backs up. And whenever men and 
women straighten their backs up, they 
are going somewhere, because a man 
can’t ride your back unless it is bent. 
If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been 
here in 1963 when the Black people of 
Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the 
conscience of this Nation and brought 
into being the civil rights bill. 
If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have had 
a chance later that year, in August, to 
try and tell America about a dream 
that I had had. 
If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been 
in Selma, Alabama, or Memphis. 
And then they were telling me, now, 
it 
doesn’t 
matter, 
now. 
It 
really 
doesn’t matter what happens. I left At-
lanta this morning, and as we got 
started the pilot said we had to stop for 
a moment because Dr. Martin Luther 
King is on the plane, we have to check 
and see if there were bombs. 
And then I got into Memphis. And 
some began to say the threats or talk 
about the threats that were out. What 
would happen to me from some of our 
sick brothers, who did not look like 
me? 
Well, I don’t know what will happen 
now. We’ve got some difficult days 
ahead. But it really doesn’t matter 
with me now because I’ve been to the 
mountaintop. 
And I don’t mind. 
Like anybody, I would like to live a 
long life. Longevity has its place. But I 
am not concerned about that now. I 
just want to do God’s will. And He has 
allowed me to go up to the mountain. 
And I’ve looked over, and I’ve seen the 
promised land. 
That is today, today, January 19, 
2022. 
I may not get there with you. But I 
want you to know tonight that we, as 
a people, will get to the promised land. 
And so I’m happy tonight. 
I’m not worried about anything. 
I’m not fearing any man. 
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the 
coming of the Lord. 
Those who say they honor him, do 
not disgrace him. Vote for the Voting 
Rights Act.

CELEBRATING MARY LOU HAND’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize a true Amer-
ican patriot, a true American hero. Ms. 
Mary Lou Hand just turned 100 years 
old on January 15, 2022. She is from 
Wall, Texas. 
Mary Lou served this country as a 
nurse in the Army in World War II. 
After first being stationed in Maryland 
and Mississippi, she was sent to Eng-
land, where she provided critical care 
for the wounded; and, more impor-
tantly, she raised soldiers’ spirits by 
spreading laughter. 
It was during her service in England 
that she met her husband, Bob. The 
two had six children together and lived 
in three countries and subsequently 
seven States. 
Ms. Mary Lou Hand has 6 children, 13 
grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren, 
and 3 great-great-grandchildren. She 
has cultivated a life of love and family, 
filled with gratitude. 
Throughout her century of life, she 
has dedicated her time to helping oth-
ers. Her selfless dedication has played 
out through her commitment to her 
family as well as her impressive career 
serving our country and caring for oth-
ers. 
Mary Lou, thank you for your service 
and happy birthday. 
RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF JOHN ‘‘J.B.’’ 
BYERS, SR. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to tell you about another pa-
triot. You know, we have patriots, and 
we 
have 
leaders, 
servant 
leaders 
throughout our entire country. This is 
a special one that I would like to talk 
about in the community of Staten Is-
land, Mr. John ‘‘J.B.’’ Byers, Sr. 
A New Jersey native, Mr. Byers 
began his remarkable 40-year career 
delivering letters for the U.S. Postal 
Service at the USPS Mariners Harbor 
Post Office and subsequently served 18 
years at the Port Richmond office. 
During his four decades of exemplary 
service, John has become a fixture of 
the community. He has become beloved 
by those he happily served for so many 
years on his daily route. 
The best measure of John’s success 
was not how efficient he was at his job, 
but it was the undeniable impact he 
had on his neighbors in the commu-
nities that he served so well. He went 
above and beyond in his duties, taking 
time to engage in the community, the 
lives and the livelihoods of the people 
he served every single day. 
His influence is evident by the mean-
ingful and positive impact he made on 
those who knew him best, his neigh-
bors, his colleagues, and his friends. 
Story after story from coworkers and 
community members alike show J.B.’s 
generosity, kindness, and work ethic. 
So much so that on John’s last day at 
the U.S. Postal Service, those on his 
route threw him a surprise party to 
demonstrate how much the service 
that he did for them meant to them 
and their lives. 
John dedicated his life to his commu-
nity through his career, and he became 
a trusted friend and familiar face to 
all. But even with his tenured and suc-
cessful career, I know the greatest joy 
for him today stems from the beautiful 
family he and his wife, Kathleen, have 
raised. As he enters retirement, John 
and Kathleen are celebrating the birth 
of their first grandchild, Madison Pa-
tricia Byers, who was born on Decem-
ber 23, 2021. 
More than a mailman, J.B. has 
brought great joy and integrity to 
countless families and neighborhoods, 
and we thank him for his service to his 
community. 
HONORING MRS. PAM BURKE 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the hard work and 
dedication of Mrs. Pam Burke of San 
Angelo, Texas. 
Mrs. Burke runs the Wesley Soup 
Kitchen, a wonderful ministry that has 
been providing meals, along with love 
and care, to all those in need since 1948. 
Mrs. Burke has been at the Wesley 
Soup Kitchen for the past 12 years, pre-
paring over 200 meals a day. In addition 
to feeding the homeless and those less 
fortunate, this ministry provides holi-
day meals and has been a consistent 
combatant of malnutrition and hunger 
throughout the community. 
Mrs. Burke is a wonderful example of 
God’s calling in John, chapter 21 to 
feed His sheep. For no monetary gain 
of her own, Mrs. Burke dedicates her 
time and her energy to opening her 
arms and caring for the community. 
I know I am not alone in saying that 
I am grateful for the mission of the 
Wesley Soup Kitchen and am honored 
to know that wonderfully impassioned 
individuals like Mrs. Pam Burke are 
working throughout each of our com-
munities.

PROTECT THE RIGHT TO VOTE

January 19, 2022 
Americans, we shall all have a say in 
the decisions that affect our lives. 
But as you know, this Nation has not 
always lived up to that promise. In-
deed, the story of American democracy 
is a story of ordinary Americans daring 
to make extraordinary sacrifices in 
order for the promise to become a re-
ality for all Americans, regardless of 
their race, gender, age, sexual orienta-
tion, or class. 
Madam Speaker, today is a day of 
great 
significance 
and 
great 
con-
sequence. We, in the House, passed the 
John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Act, 
as well as the Freedom to Vote Act. 
Now, today, the Senate will take up 
and debate both bills and vote on the 
future of our democracy. 
What is at stake is clear. The current 
state of voting rights is very clear. Old 
battles have become new again, as 
State legislatures across this Nation 
have erected deliberate barriers to the 
ballot box in an all-out assault on the 
right to vote. 
Though we no longer have a poll tax, 
nor do we have to count how many 
jelly beans are in a jar, we do know 
that the modern-day restrictions are 
no less pernicious: Long lines, closed 
polling stations, purged voter rolls, 
bans on early voting, and the list goes 
on and on. In Georgia it is now a crime 
to hand out food and water to a voter 
in line. And so I ask you, What are we 
afraid of? 
Madam Speaker, the significance of 
this moment is not lost on me for, you 
see, representing Alabama’s 7th Con-
gressional District, voting rights are 
very personal. People in my district 
fought, marched, prayed, and, yes, 
some died for the equal right of all 
Americans to vote. 
I know that this body reveres our 
late, great Congressman John Lewis. It 
was John who said that the struggle for 
voting rights is not a struggle for one 
day or one year, it is a struggle for a 
lifetime. 
So we have to fight—every genera-
tion does—to protect the progress of 
the past and to advance it. And that is 
exactly what the John Robert Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act does. 
I ask our Senators; how will they be 
remembered? Years from now, when 
our children and grandchildren look 
back on this moment and ask, What 
did you do to fight for voting rights? 
How will you be remembered? 
Now, we are not asking our Senators 
to march. We are not asking them to 
sacrifice. We are not asking them to 
bleed on a bridge. 
We are asking them to do their jobs. 
To do their jobs. 
We are asking them to have the cour-
age of their convictions, to use their 
position of great power to save our de-
mocracy in this critical moment. 
Madam Speaker, to my colleagues, 
voting rights advocates, and stake-
holders, I say, no matter what the out-
come is today, we cannot be deterred. 
John Lewis and those brave foot sol-
diers did not give up. Think of where 
our country would be if John and Hosea 
Williams and those that were bludg-
eoned on that bridge hadn’t picked 
themselves 
up 
2 
days 
later 
and 
marched again. 
Voting rights is a struggle of a life-
time, and we have to be in that fight. 
We cannot be tired. We can be frus-
trated. We can be downright mad. But 
we cannot give up. We have so many 
more miles to go before we declare vic-
tory. And victory we must have be-
cause our democracy depends on it. 
Our colleague, JIM
CLYBURN, this 
past weekend invoked the Bible. He 
said, it is darkest before the dawn. In-
deed, by not taking this moment to 
protect the right to vote, we are allow-
ing extremists to strip away the power 
of the people. 
We all celebrated Dr. Martin Luther 
King’s birthday on Monday. Dr. King 
said that ‘‘ . . . the arc of the moral 
universe is long, but it bends towards 
justice.’’ But it only bends if we Ameri-
cans decide to challenge it, decide to 
make sure that this Constitution lives 
up to its ideals. It is time for the Sen-
ate to do their part. 
In remembrance of the sacrifices of 
others, the Senate must reform its 
rules. We all have a role to play. And I 
say to the activists and to the Sen-
ators, the time to act is always now. 
King said it is always time to do 
what is right. We must get into some 
good trouble. We must keep our eyes 
on the prize, and the prize is our de-
mocracy and restoring the right to 
vote.

FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF 
ELECTIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, Wash-
ington Democrats have become des-
perate to shield their slim majorities 
in the House and Senate; so desperate, 
in fact, that they are willing to silence 
millions of Americans by orchestrating 
a Federal takeover of elections. 
Look no further than H.R. 1 and H.R. 
4. These pieces of legislation are the 
ones Americans should be concerned 
about. 
b 1030 
Madam 
Speaker, 
all 
Washington 
Democrats have done is operate off 
their own manufactured hysteria. 
Thanks to ranking member RODNEY 
DAVIS of the Committee on House Ad-
ministration, we have the facts on why 
the Democrats’ narrative is wrong. 
2020 saw the highest voter turnout in 
120 years, and according to Pew, 94 per-
cent said it is easy to vote. There is 
clearly no widespread ‘‘voter suppres-
sion’’ issue in this country. 
Georgia’s new ‘‘voter suppression 
law’’ has more days of early in-person 
voting than New York. 
Texas’ ‘‘voter suppression law’’ ends 
pandemic exceptions like universal 
drive-thru voting and 24-hour voting. 
Neither existed in Texas before 2020. 
Neither widely exists even in blue 
States. 
When it comes to abolishing the fili-
buster, there are even more facts. 
The filibuster prevents Federal laws 
swinging wildly with every election. 
If the filibuster is taken away, mil-
lions of citizens and entire States 
would be silenced. 
Senator SCHUMER’s push is not a re-
sponse to the 2020 election or new State 
laws. 
As early as 2019 and August 2020, Sen-
ator SCHUMER was already discussing 
abolishing the filibuster, but only if he 
won control. 
If the filibuster is wiped clean off the 
map, imagine what will be done next: 
Packing the Supreme Court; ramming 
through the Green New Deal; defunding 
the police, and every other misguided 
item that Washington Democrats have 
in their political playbook. 
The consequences would be disas-
trous for America. 
Madam Speaker, Americans do not 
want the one-party rule agenda of 
Washington Democrats, the anniver-
sary of which is tomorrow. 
They do not want to see their own 
country become even more bankrupted 
by the failed policies under this admin-
istration and razor-thin majority. 
Republicans will continue to stand 
firm against this far-left agenda, and 
we will not sit on the sidelines. 
It is vital that Americans know what 
these election bills will do and the con-
sequences that will affect this great 
country if they are passed. 
Thank you again to Ranking Member 
RODNEY DAVIS and his staff for their 
continued hard work and diligence on 
this issue.

CONGRESS IS SERVING OUR 
VETERANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to speak about news 
that many people don’t hear too much 
about coming out of Washington. 
Too often they only hear one side of 
the story about divisiveness, gridlock, 
and a general unwillingness to put re-
sults over politics. 
And don’t get me wrong, it is a prob-
lem, but there are a whole lot of us in 
this body that are fighting every day 
to put an end to that and break the 
cycle in Washington, especially when it 
comes to our veterans. 
In the past 2 months alone we have 
seen legislative breakthroughs that 
had the support of both Democrats and 
Republicans to help make sure that our 
country continues to serve our Na-
tion’s veterans. 
I introduced bipartisan, bicameral 
legislation with Representatives AN-
THONY GONZALEZ, TONY GONZALES, and 
COLIN ALLRED to invest in the Zero 
Suicide initiative and bring account-
ability into the VA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H225 
January 19, 2022 
Last week, this House passed legisla-
tion that will end a GI Bill disparity 
between the National Guard and Re-
serve members so that every single 
servicemember can access the benefits 
their sacrifices have earned. 
And last month, President Biden 
signed the REMOTE Act into law to ex-
tend legislation to protect student ben-
efits for veterans. 
In southern Nevada alone, 200 vet-
erans were facing cuts in their benefits, 
but with our votes in the House and 
Senate and President Biden’s signa-
ture, those benefits were extended, and 
it was just that easy. 
These are just a few examples of the 
bipartisan wins this Congress has been 
able to accomplish for veterans. 
You see, a lot of legislation before us, 
especially bills that serve our veterans, 
are common sense. And I encourage 
Washington to not lose sight of those 
two words: Common sense. 
f 
HONORING SURVIVORS AND FAMI-
LIES OF FORMER HOSTAGES OF 
THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to call upon my fellow Members 
of Congress to support H.R. 1179, which 
will award the Congressional Gold 
Medal to the survivors of the Iran hos-
tage crisis and to the families of the 
former hostages who are, sadly, no 
longer with us. 
Over 40 years ago, in November of 
1979, protests in the Iranian capital of 
Tehran led to crowds storming the 
United States Embassy and taking the 
staff inside as hostages. Fifty-two 
Americans, made up of both civilian 
and military personnel, were made 
prisoners in our own embassy and be-
came victims of a terrorist attack upon 
international law. 
For over a year, the hostages were 
denied their basic human dignity with 
their captors inflicting upon them in-
creasing physical and psychological 
torture, to include simulated execu-
tions. Madam Speaker, they would 
take these hostages and go through the 
motions of being executed, often pull-
ing the trigger of an empty gun to in-
still fear. It was wrong. These brave 
Americans 
held 
strong 
throughout 
their harrowing ordeal, never once los-
ing faith in each other or that they 
may return home to their families 
again. Their courage and patriotism 
are an inspiration to all of us today, 
just as it was to our Nation 40 years 
ago. 
Through diplomatic success, all 52 of 
the hostages were released in January 
of 1981, free to return home to their 
loved ones and their country, with this 
January 20 marking the 41st anniver-
sary of their freedom. Despite that, 
many of them have not recovered from 
their trauma; to this day still haunted 
by what they had to endure. Alongside 
having to carry these burdens for over 
40 years, these 52 heroes never received 
proper recognition from their govern-
ment for the sacrifices they were 
forced to make in captivity. They are 
true American heroes, and it is time 
that Congress acknowledges them as 
such, which is why I call upon my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1179. The 
awarding of the Congressional Gold 
Medal to the survivors and the families 
of the deceased will not only bring jus-
tice to these patriots, but also dem-
onstrate this Nation’s commitment to 
protect those whose human rights 
would be violated. 
This bipartisan bill is a symbol of our 
Nation’s ability to come together to 
honor our heroes; currently there are 
145 cosponsors of this bill with a near 
even split between Democrats and Re-
publicans. 
Additionally, I would like to thank 
the tremendous efforts of Commission 
52 for helping to spread awareness of 
this bill and gathering support for it. 
Their commitment to righting the 
wrongs of over 40 years ago is an inspi-
ration to all.

HONORING WANDA YOUNG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the late Wanda 
Young, former singer of the renowned 
Motown Marvelettes and resident of 
the Inkster community in Michigan’s 
13th District Strong. 
Ms. 
Young 
made 
her 
mark 
on 
Motown when she was asked to join the 
local singing group comprised of many 
of the Inkster High School students 
and alumni. 
The 
group, 
now 
known 
as 
the 
Marvelettes, was quickly signed to the 
Tamla record label, later known as 
Motown Records. 
They earned Motown one of its big-
gest hits with ‘‘Please, Mr. Postman.’’ 
Wanda Young sang lead on many of 
the 
recordings 
including 
the 
hit, 
‘‘Don’t Mess Around with Bill.’’ 
Ms. Young was an integral part of the 
Motown 
music 
scene 
and 
defining 
sound of the 1960s. 
Ms. Young’s example has inspired 
countless women and African American 
performers across our country. 
Please join me in recognizing Wanda 
Young’s contributions to our Nation 
and Michigan’s 13th District Strong as 
we honor her legacy at home and 
across the globe. 
RECOGNIZING MICHELLE MARTINEZ 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Michelle Martinez, 
Detroit resident and environmental 
justice warrior from Michigan’s 13th 
District Strong as she departs as exec-
utive director from the Michigan Envi-
ronmental Justice Coalition. 
For many years, Michelle has been a 
pillar of our community, advocating 
for clean air and water, and fighting 
against 
environmental 
racism 
that 
hurts our neighbors’ quality of life. 
Michelle has worked tirelessly, and I 
firsthand saw this myself, for various 
organizations over the last 15 years and 
has never wavered in seeking justice 
for the people who live with the effects 
of pollution. 
I worked closely with Michelle on a 
number of initiatives when I served in 
the Michigan State legislature, and she 
has been an amazing person to watch 
grow as an advocate and leader in our 
State. 
Michelle has always taken a bold ap-
proach 
to 
making 
transformative 
change for our communities that is 
meaningful and has never shied away 
from a challenge. 
So please join me in recognizing 
Michelle Martinez’ outstanding con-
tributions 
to 
the 
communities 
of 
Michigan’s 13th Congressional District 
as we wish her well on her next ven-
ture. 
CONGRESS HAS A CLEAR MANDATE TO PROTECT, 
RESTORE, AND
EXPAND
VOTING
RIGHTS
IN 
AMERICA 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to make clear that we, as Rep-
resentatives of the people, have a clear 
mandate to protect, restore, and ex-
pand voting rights in our Nation. 
In my hometown of Detroit, election 
workers and community members were 
intimidated, 
shouted 
at, 
and 
disrespected for simply counting the 
votes of our community, a majority 
Black community, in November of 2020. 
People 
banged 
on 
the 
windows, 
Madam Speaker, on the counting room 
just because they didn’t want Black 
and Brown votes to be counted. 
Our community was treated like we 
were unworthy of making our voices 
heard at the ballot box. 
This should not be so complicated. 
If our colleagues in the Senate fail to 
pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act, their inaction will send a 
clear message to folks that voter sup-
pression is okay. Voter suppression is 
not okay. It simply is not. Intimi-
dating our election workers is not 
okay. Inaction is not an option, and we 
must deliver for the people.

AN ATTACK ON ELECTION 
INTEGRITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, House Democrats this 
past week passed a bill to nationalize 
elections. On a party-line vote Demo-
crats, led by Speaker PELOSI, passed a 
bill nationalizing elections in an at-
tempt to maintain power. 
If ultimately enacted, this would 
consolidate power and control of all 
elections in the hands of Speaker 
PELOSI and the Democratic Party. 
This bill is an attack on election in-
tegrity. 
Their claims of voter suppression 
could not be further from the truth. 
The 2020 election had the highest turn-
out in 120 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H226 
January 19, 2022 
A poll by Pew Research Center found 
that 94 percent of those asked said it 
was easy to vote. Thankfully there ap-
pears to be no path to get the votes 
needed to pass this danger to democ-
racy bill in the Senate. 
MARCH FOR LIFE IS A CELEBRATION OF LIFE 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, later this week, tens 
of thousands of Americans will travel 
to D.C. to take part in the 48th March 
for Life. 
They will not be alone. Across the 
country, Americans will march to their 
State capitals in protest of the Roe v. 
Wade decision. 
This march is a celebration of life. It 
is a march full of joy. It is inspiring, it 
is peaceful, and it is welcoming to all 
who wish to attend. 
Today, it continues to be the largest 
annual human rights demonstration in 
the world. The goal is simple, to cele-
brate life with the hope that one day 
we live in a world where every life is 
celebrated, valued, and protected. 
This year’s theme is equality begins 
in the womb. As Jeanne Mancini, presi-
dent of the March of Life said best, ‘‘As 
our 
country 
continues to advance 
along the path to a more just society, 
we cannot ignore the discrimination 
that is taking place against vulnerable 
unborn babies. . . . ’’ 
In the Declaration of Independence, 
Thomas 
Jefferson 
penned 
three 
unalienable rights, life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. 
As Members of Congress, it is our job 
to uphold those rights. 
Since coming to Congress in 2009, I 
am proud to be a strong proponent of 
standing for life and giving a voice to 
the voiceless. 
Many of my colleagues have intro-
duced legislation to advance the pro- 
life cause. I am proud to cosponsor 
many of these bills, including the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act, the Defund Planned Parent-
hood Act, the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act, the Sanctity of Human 
Life Act, the Protecting the Dignity of 
the Unborn Children Act, and the Life 
at Conception Act. 
In addition, I proudly stand on this 
House floor advocating for these poli-
cies and thwarting any attacks on the 
unborn. 
Madam Speaker, our country is at a 
turning point. Right now we are experi-
encing the most pro-abortion adminis-
tration in our history. 
For the first time in over four dec-
ades, Democrats removed the Hyde 
amendment 
from 
legislation. 
This 
amendment is a bipartisan agreement 
which prevents direct taxpayer funding 
of abortion and is supported by 77 per-
cent of Americans. 
As pro-abortion advocates continue 
to try to stifle one of our unalienable 
rights, I know this House will continue 
to work tirelessly at the Federal level 
to put the health and safety of women 
and children first. 
As long as the cloud of abortion 
looms over our country, we must con-
tinue to be the shining light for those 
who cannot defend themselves. 
Now I am proud of the brave women, 
men, and children who will travel to 
Washington this week. 
We must always be a voice for the 
voiceless. And we must continue to 
build a culture that values life and re-
spects mothers and their children. 
Ahead of this year’s march, I stand 
here and redouble my commitment to 
protecting the most vulnerable among 
us, the unborn.

ADDRESSING YOUTH MENTAL 
HEALTH CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, 
the trauma, disruption, stress, and iso-
lation caused by the COVID–19 pan-
demic has greatly accelerated the men-
tal health crisis facing our young peo-
ple. I have seen this reflected in my 
own 
community. 
My 
alma 
mater, 
Neuqua 
Valley 
High 
School 
in 
Naperville, Illinois, has lost two stu-
dents to suicide just this school year. 
These are not isolated events. We are 
seeing the impacts of the youth mental 
health crisis play out in schools and 
communities across my district and 
across the Nation. Lurie Children’s 
Hospital in Chicago has seen the num-
ber of children admitted as a result of 
suicide attempts increase from two to 
three children per month to two to 
three per day. There are now 3,000 chil-
dren on their waitlist for outpatient 
mental healthcare. This is absolutely 
heartbreaking. 
However, I find hope in seeing young 
people in my community stand up in 
the face of tragedy and demand solu-
tions from their schools and govern-
ment officials. They shouldn’t have to 
do this, but they are organizing, par-
ticipating in school board meetings, 
and writing and calling my office. I 
want them to know that I hear them, 
and I am fighting for them. 
This summer, I introduced the Child 
Suicide Prevention and Lethal Means 
Safety Act to invest in educating 
healthcare 
providers 
and 
evidence- 
based youth suicide prevention meas-
ures. It is absolutely critical that we 
act immediately to address the grow-
ing unmet need for more school-based 
mental health providers. 
That is why I am fighting for the 
maximum possible funding through the 
Department 
of 
Education 
for 
the 
school-based mental health workforce 
in the omnibus appropriations package. 
I am inviting all Members to join this 
bipartisan effort. 
Last month, I was proud to join As-
sistant Speaker KATHERINE CLARK to 
introduce the Elementary and Sec-
ondary School Counseling Act to pro-
vide consistent, long-term funding to 
support schools in hiring more school- 
based mental health providers and 
meet the recommended student-to-pro-
vider ratios. 
As we begin another year of fighting 
the COVID–19 pandemic, we must tar-
get resources toward supporting the 
mental health of kids in school. As 
U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy 
warned in his recent advisory on youth 
mental health: ‘‘It would be a tragedy 
if we beat back one public health crisis 
only to allow another to grow in its 
place.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues in both the House and Senate 
to work together and across the aisle 
to pass legislation, including a fiscal 
year 2022 spending package, that makes 
necessary investments in combating 
the mental health crisis facing young 
people. 
We must seize this critical oppor-
tunity to build better, safer, and more 
supportive environments for our young 
people to grow and thrive.

UNDERSTANDING PRESIDENT 
BIDEN’S FAILURES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today because I need this Congress 
to understand the failures of President 
Biden as our Nation’s Commander in 
Chief. 
This administration was handed the 
reins to a country that had an economy 
that was ready to bounce back after 
pandemic restrictions, a southern bor-
der that was more secure than any 
other point in our Nation’s history, and 
a foreign policy that had us respected 
around the globe. Instead of simply 
being a caretaker, who ran on being a 
unifying force—and I want to say that 
again; he ran on being a unifying 
force—this President chose to play pol-
itics of division from day one and 
began dismantling all the positive poli-
cies of President Trump. 
In January 2021, the President halted 
construction of the border wall and 
overturned countless immigration poli-
cies that clearly worked. These policies 
stopped 
dangerous 
caravans 
from 
bringing thousands of illegal aliens to 
our southern border. These policies 
protected thousands of illegals from 
the horrors of human trafficking, and 
these policies kept not only our coun-
try’s borders safe but the community 
of the entire world safe as well. 
In this President’s first year, he 
chose to spend trillions of American 
tax dollars on COVID relief. He spent 
those dollars on the backs of our chil-
dren and grandchildren when there was 
nearly a trillion dollars from previous 
relief packages still unspent. 
This wasteful spending that has in-
cluded payments to keep people from 
working has led to our Nation’s supply 
chain disaster and the highest inflation 
in nearly 40 years, not to mention the 
labor shortage that we are facing now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H227 
January 19, 2022 
Last week, President Biden gave a 
speech in Georgia that was not only di-
visive and hateful but downright des-
picable—from the man who ran on: I 
am going to unify this country. 
He demanded that Congress give him 
what he wants, and anyone who op-
poses him is a racist and a bigot. Seri-
ously? That is the best you have? When 
you can’t debate the issues, you resort 
to calling half of the American people 
and anyone who doesn’t agree with you 
a racist and a bigot? I think the Amer-
ican people deserve a little bit better. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the 
aisle 
railed 
against 
President 
Trump for anything they deemed divi-
sive. So I ask them this: Will they con-
demn this? Will they condemn their 
President for calling half of all Ameri-
cans racist? I doubt it. 
Madam Speaker, I grew up through 
the disastrous Presidency of Jimmy 
Carter. President Carter is often con-
sidered the worst President in modern 
history. It appears President Biden 
wants to take that crown. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
HIGHLIGHTING THE LEFT’S COVID 
HYPOCRISY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the left’s widespread 
misinformation 
and 
hypocrisy 
sur-
rounding the coronavirus pandemic. 
After repeatedly promising to shut 
down COVID–19 and vowing that all 
Americans would have access to reg-
ular, reliable, and free testing, the 
Biden administration has added a new 
crisis to its growing list of failures: the 
COVID crisis. 
As our Nation faces a testing short-
age, which began before the holiday 
season, I find it appropriate to quote 
President Biden himself from 2020: 
‘‘Where are the tests, Mr. President?’’ 
Considering all the coronavirus fund-
ing that Congress has provided the ad-
ministration, that is the multitrillion- 
dollar question that has only been an-
swered with deflection and poor leader-
ship. 
Interestingly, 
now 
that 
the 
coronavirus death count is higher 
under President Biden than President 
Trump, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol, or the CDC, is apparently sepa-
rating the data now to reveal how 
many Americans have died with COVID 
compared to how many have died from 
COVID. 
Republicans have been shouting this 
difference from the rooftops for over 2 
years, during which the left quickly la-
beled our valid concerns as conspir-
acies. Yet, when the important dif-
ference can provide cover to the Presi-
dent, Democrats jump on board, and 
the leftwing media hides the hypocrisy. 
How convenient. 
In fact, CDC Director Walensky re-
cently admitted that 75 percent—yes, 
75 percent—of COVID deaths occurred 
in 
people 
with 
at 
least 
four 
comorbidities. 
Every life is precious, and families 
deserve the truth. The question must 
be answered: How many Americans 
died with COVID compared to how 
many died from COVID? Our govern-
ment agencies should have been report-
ing health data accurately from the be-
ginning, not as a matter of political 
cover. 
Since Biden can’t shut down COVID, 
suddenly, this data is being shared pub-
licly. It is no wonder polling indicates 
that public trust in the CDC is plum-
meting. 
Science is respected when people are 
skeptical, when people ask questions. 
None of that is happening now. Nobody 
questions the outcomes. And we won-
der why the CDC has lost credibility. 
We wonder why people think the new 
meaning of the acronym is the center 
for Democrat control. 
Keep in mind, this is all unfolding as 
we discover more evidence that Dr. 
Fauci, the highest-paid government of-
ficial—an unelected one, I might add— 
has continuously concealed the truth 
concerning gain of function research at 
the Chinese Wuhan Institute of Virol-
ogy, including his own knowledge and 
his own involvement. 
Meanwhile, the administration con-
tinues to seek his deceptive guidance 
to push the narrative that we need 
more government control. Fauci’s lies, 
the CDC’s total lack of credibility, and 
the President’s inability to rise to the 
moment and effectively lead all con-
tribute to the COVID crisis, causing 
great damage and harm to the Amer-
ican people. 
SUPPORTING SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the sanctity of 
human life. 
Later this week, on January 22, our 
Nation will mourn the 49th anniversary 
of Roe v. Wade, a treacherous decision 
that has led to the murder of more 
than 62 million innocent babies. That 
is more than 62 million dreams never 
achieved, talents never realized, and 
lives never lived. In the blink of an eye, 
their chance of a happy life and a 
promising future has vanished. May 
God have mercy on their unborn souls. 
What an unspeakable tragedy that 
corrupts the morals and values that 
our great country was founded on over 
two centuries ago. I am proud to have 
cosponsored H. Res. 58, led by my good 
friend JODY HICE, to memorialize the 
anniversary of Roe v. Wade as the day 
of tears by lowering our flag to half- 
staff each year in honor of the unborn 
lives lost to the evils of abortion. 
After being involved with the crisis 
pregnancy center in Athens, Georgia, 
for nearly two decades, I can confirm 
to you that the consequences of abor-
tion go well beyond the murder of mil-
lions of precious lives. Despite being 
portrayed as a simple and quick solu-
tion, abortion ultimately alters at 
least three lives instead of one: a child 
that is lost forever, a mother that is 
scarred for life, and a father that is 
burdened with lifelong guilt. 
We must never downplay the evils of 
abortion. As an unapologetic pro-life 
advocate, I am proud to defend the un-
born and fight for the sanctity of life 
because every life is invaluable, wor-
thy, and made in the perfect image of 
God.

ENDING THE SCOURGE OF 
ABORTION IN AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. MILLER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, all children are created by 
God at conception with a purpose. We 
must continue our work to end the 
scourge of abortion in America without 
exception. 
The strides that we have made for 
the pro-life movement over recent 
years are incredible, and I am honored 
to be part of a group of such hard-
working pro-life legislators. 
Our daughters are part of the pro-life 
generation, full of students and young 
women that want to protect life in the 
womb. They have seen their siblings in 
sonograms. They have seen the pic-
tures, and when they are told it is a 
glob of tissue, they know better. 
I introduced the Protecting Life on 
College Campuses Act, which would 
prohibit any Federal funds from going 
to a college or university which is sup-
plying dangerous chemical abortion 
pills. 
This past Christmas, the week before 
Christmas, while no one was looking, 
the Biden administration and Governor 
Pritzker advanced very radical abor-
tion policies, which are deeply unpopu-
lar with the American people. They 
want to remove parental involvement 
every step of the way for minors re-
ceiving an abortion because they are 
not pro-choice; they are pro-abortion. 
Standing strong in this fight, we are 
participating in what could be poten-
tially the last March for Life under 
Roe, and I could not be more thrilled.

HONORING AND REMEMBERING 
SHIRLEY WATERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember Mrs. 
Shirley Waters of Rome, New York, for 
her outstanding leadership and service. 
Sadly, Mrs. Waters passed away this 
December at the age of 100, leaving a 
legacy of service whose impact is felt 
throughout our entire area. 
Shirley and her late husband, George 
Waters, have been devoted pillars of 
our community. The Waters family has 
owned and published the Rome Daily 
Sentinel newspaper since 1928. Shirley 
served as the vice president until her 
retirement in 2012.

Our family also published a news-
paper in central New York, and I have 
always been inspired by Shirley’s end-
less energy, good humor, and, yes, 
strong opinions on many subjects—a 
woman after my own heart. 
b 1100 
I have also always been inspired by 
Shirley’s tenacity and commitment to 
informing our community with depth 
and integrity, something that the 
Rome Daily Sentinel has always done 
throughout its history. 
In addition to being a publisher, 
Shirley was a beloved mother of five 
who was active in her church and a 
member of our local artist community. 
Shirley’s paintings hang in galleries in 
our region and live on to evoke wonder 
and inspire serenity to so many. 
Shirley was also an honored member 
of the Order of Saint Barbara, as well 
as an honorary member of the North-
east Air Defense Sector. Shirley even 
helped secure the B–52 bomber dis-
played in Rome at the entrance to the 
former Griffiss Air Force Base, which 
she obtained from the national B–52 
museum committee. 
On behalf of our community and 
those in the news business who are 
committed to serving the public as 
true members of the fourth estate, we 
are grateful to Shirley Waters for being 
our standard-bearer. We are also grate-
ful to her for her distinguished service 
to our community beyond her role as a 
newspaper publisher. 
Her legacy will continue to live on in 
so many important ways, from the 
great newspaper she leaves, the Rome 
Daily Sentinel, to her work which she 
also loved, to her works of art that are 
exhibited throughout our region, and 
her strong belief in our region’s great-
ness and history. 
My 
deepest 
condolences 
to 
the 
Waters family on the loss of this won-
derful, venerable wife, mother, grand-
mother, 
and 
tenacious 
community 
leader 
with 
a 
wonderful 
sense 
of 
humor. 
RECOGNITION OF TROOPER KEVIN BEACH 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Rome Police Chief 
Kevin Beach who will retire at the end 
of January after an incredible career 
and true devotion to public service. 
Kevin first joined the Rome Police 
Department in September of 1994, fol-
lowing in his father’s footsteps. Kevin’s 
father, Bruce, also served the depart-
ment for many years. Kevin showed 
leadership early on the job and was 
promoted quickly to the rank of detec-
tive after only 6 years. 
In 2005, Kevin was appointed detec-
tive commander and then deputy chief 
in 2007. In 2008, he was appointed as the 
youngest police chief in the history of 
the city of Rome. 
At just 36, Kevin had served the de-
partment for only 14 years but was 
picked for the top spot because of his 
exemplary track record and strong 
leadership skills. Kevin’s hard work, 
dedication, and love for the city was 
evident every day he was on the job. 
During his tenure as chief, the de-
partment introduced community pro-
grams such as Shop with a Cop, Law 
Enforcement Day, and the creation of a 
Community Impact Unit. Kevin has 
also successfully navigated the depart-
ment through difficult times through 
the COVID–19 pandemic and the na-
tional defund the police movement. 
Kevin, thank you for your lifetime of 
service and commitment to the city of 
Rome. We are grateful for your devo-
tion to service on behalf of your com-
munity. I also want to thank you for 
your friendship and sage counsel to me 
and so many others during your impor-
tant work as our chief. May you enjoy 
a productive and healthy retirement. 
RECOGNITION OF TROOPER DAVID DRAUDT 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, it is 
often said that law enforcement offi-
cers work for a cause, not applause. 
This is certainly true and today I 
would like to recognize a trooper from 
the southern tier of New York’s 22nd 
district who deserves our applause. 
Trooper David Draudt went to work 
on the morning of November 29 with 
the intent to protect and serve. Yet, on 
that day Trooper Draudt not only pro-
tected and served his community, but 
he also called on his extensive training 
to courageously save the life of an un-
responsive 2-year-old boy who had 
choked himself into unconsciousness. 
Trooper Draudt didn’t lace up his boots 
that morning intent on saving a life. 
But that is exactly what he did. 
Law enforcement officers do not have 
the opportunity of choosing who or 
what they encounter each day. They 
rely on their training and their knowl-
edge and their experiences to respond 
with honor, courage, and integrity and, 
of course, compassion to whatever situ-
ation may arise. On November 29, that 
is exactly what Trooper Draudt did. 
Today, our cause is applause; ap-
plause not just for Trooper Draudt who 
saved the life of a child, but to all who 
answer the call to serve.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, our redeemer, preserver, and 
friend, hear our prayers this day as we 
seek to live our lives in obedience to 
You. 
For You have not set us apart from 
this world, but have placed us into our 
communities, then sent us into posi-
tions of authority, so that we would be 
salt to the Earth; to preserve and pro-
tect the ideals on which this country 
was founded; to enhance and uphold 
the virtues by which this government 
was formed; to live our lives according 
to Your divine Word. 
May we not take lightly this extraor-
dinary opportunity You have given us 
or allow our words or actions to be-
come corrosive or damaging in the ex-
ercise of our influence. 
Rather, may our faithfulness to Your 
Word serve the purpose of enhancing 
the lives of those around us and the 
purposes for which You have sent us. 
Grant us, then, together a peaceful 
relationship, that the salt that we are 
and the hallowed responsibilities we 
share together would serve to glorify 
You. 
In the gift of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and

Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, the bipartisan Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs law will invest 
more than $14 billion this year alone in 
the Nation’s ports and waterways. 
In my community, this will provide 
$10 million for Times Beach Nature

tats and parkland.

CONGRATULATING RIVERHEADS 
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, high 
school athletics play an important role 
in the lives of so many young people in 
the communities that they live in, 
which is why I have a policy of speak-
ing from the floor to congratulate my 
district’s State championship teams. 
Today, I am here to honor the 
Riverheads High School football team, 
which won the VHSL Class 1 State title 
last month. Not only did the Glad-
iators best their opponent by an im-
pressive 45–14 point margin, but this 
victory marked the team’s sixth con-
secutive State championship, the only 
football program in VHSL history to 
accomplish such a feat. 
And if that weren’t monumental 
enough, the game was also the team’s 
50th straight win, which is the longest 
active winning streak in our Nation. 
For the past 26 years, this team has 
been led by Coach Robert Casto, who 
has sadly announced that he will be re-
tiring at the end of the school year. 
Coach Casto’s remarkable coaching ca-
reer comes to an end with an overall 
record of 59 losses and 261 wins, includ-
ing nine State championships. 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
recognize this talented football team 
and their remarkable coach. Go Glad-
iators. 
f 
DEMOCRATS HAVE DELIVERED 
FOR THE PEOPLE 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, last year 
Democrats passed the American Rescue 
Plan that provided funding to schools 
so they could reopen, funding to cities 
and States so that first responders, 
municipal employees, and county em-
ployees didn’t get laid off, and it got 
stimulus checks to the American peo-
ple. 
As a result, we were able to have over 
6 million jobs created since January 20, 
2020, and the lowest unemployment 
rate now in nearly 50 years. 
However, with the opening of our 
economies across the world, inflation 
has happened, including in the United 
States, and that is why I am so pleased 
that the Biden administration has an-
nounced $14 billion to go to 500 Army 
Corps of Engineers projects, including 
at ports to help with supply chain 
issues. By making sure we can move 
goods faster and easier and to address 
these supply chain issues, we will re-
duce the cost of goods, and that was be-
cause Democrats also passed the infra-
structure law. Democrats have deliv-
ered for the people. 
f 
SANITY MAY BE RETURNING 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, in a political environ-
ment where even Democrats have cited 
the Biden agenda as fiscal insanity, it 
is reassuring sanity may be returning 
with the Democrat Washington Post 
last Tuesday and Thursday being re-
markably sane. 
On Tuesday, the lead editorial cor-
rectly reviewed, ‘‘President Biden is 
facing mounting criticism for infla-
tion’s rise to its highest level since 
1982. Unfortunately, the White House’s 
latest response is to blame greedy busi-
nesses. Economists across the political 
spectrum are rightly calling out the 
White House for this foolishness.’’ 
On Thursday, front-page headlines 
were shocking: Inflation for 2021 high-
est in 40 years. Trend expected to last 
for months. Prices become potent po-
litical threat to Biden. 
The Democrat elite think they are 
smarter than everyone and think Dem-
ocrat voters and Democrat media are 
ignorant to believe that trillion-dollar 
spending costs zero dollars. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues, moving from the Afghani-
stan safe haven to America, as sadly 
we saw with the suicide bomber who 
attacked the synagogue in Texas on 
Saturday.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DEPUTY 
SHERIFF SEAN RILEY 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
and service of Wayne County Deputy 
Sheriff Sean Riley. 
Our communities in Illinois and 
across the Nation continue to mourn 
the loss of our fallen hero. 
Deputy Riley was called home to be 
with the Lord on December 29, 2021. He 
was on duty, responding to assist a mo-
torist when he was shot and killed. 
May God continue to comfort this 
family as they grieve this awful loss. 
Wayne County Sheriff Otey said, ‘‘The 
only thing Sean cared about more than 
being a deputy was his family.’’ 
Please join me in prayer for the fam-
ily of Deputy Sean Riley, the Wayne 
County Sheriff’s Department, and our 
community in Illinois. 
Blessed are the peacemakers, for 
they shall be called the sons of God. 
RIGHT TO LIFE MARCH 
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise to stand in solidarity with the 
many Americans, including my own 
constituents from Texas’ Third Con-
gressional District, who are here at our 
Nation’s Capital to march for the right 
to life. 
As a father of three wonderful daugh-
ters, I know how precious every stage 
of life is, and I believe it should be pro-
tected at every stage. 
Every year, I am awed by the out-
pouring of love and passion so many 
Texans show by traveling to Wash-
ington and voicing their support for 
sanctity of life. Even more travel to 
our state capital in Austin to advance 
the cause in our local communities. 
Your engagement is humbling, and it 
gives me faith that we can become the 
pro-life generation. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing the pro-life and faith lead-
ers here in our Nation’s Capital and 
join in fighting to protect innocent 
human life.

CONCERNED PARENTS ARE NOT

(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given

cerned parents have a God-given right 
to make decisions for their child’s best 
interests, not the Federal Government, 
the Biden administration, or teachers’ 
unions. 
Yet, Education Secretary Cardona 
colluded with private parties to get the 
FBI to investigate concerned parents 
and worked with the National School 
Boards Association to brand the con-
cerned parents involved as domestic 
terrorists.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H230 
January 19, 2022 
In the infamous letter which the Sec-
retary solicited from the National 
School Boards Association, he sug-
gested using the PATRIOT Act and 
that the FBI should begin inves-
tigating concerned parents at school 
board meetings. The letter had nothing 
to do with curriculum. The topic was 
how to vilify and target parents that 
disagreed with the narrative. 
Secretary Cardona has repeatedly de-
nied involvement in the letter, but re-
cently released documents have ex-
posed the truth. These actions show a 
clear pattern that puts politics over 
the interests of the parents and espe-
cially their children and their edu-
cation. 
Parents are right to be concerned 
about their kids being taught radical 
ideologies or being exposed to inappro-
priate materials. Every parent in the 
Nation, regardless of ideology, should 
be alarmed that the Federal Govern-
ment is trying to strip away their 
rights 
and 
use 
these 
underhanded 
methods to try to silence them.

AMERICANS ARE FACING ONE 
CRISIS AFTER ANOTHER 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, tomor-
row marks the 1-year anniversary of 
one-party, radical rule in D.C. 
With Democrats at the helm, Ameri-
cans have faced one crisis after an-
other, unfortunately. We have the 
highest inflation in 41 years, supply 
chain disruptions, workforce shortages 
in critical industries, spikes in energy 
costs; record numbers of people and 
drugs illegally entering our southern 
border, a surge in crime, national secu-
rity threats, a series of foreign rela-
tions disasters; in my opinion, a mis-
managed pandemic, and countless ex-
amples of government intrusion into 
all aspects of our lives. 
Instead of addressing these problems, 
Democrats have doubled down on failed 
policies, have engaged in out-of-control 
spending, and are trying to control 
every aspect of Americans’ lives. 
This is not the way forward. 
I recently asked my constituents one 
simple question: ‘‘Is your family better 
off than you were a year ago?’’ Almost 
70 percent of the respondents said no. 
Fixing that problem should be Con-
gress’ main priority. 
f 
PIKE COUNTY DESERVES A 
LARGER PILT PAYMENT 
(Mr. RYAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, pay-
ments in lieu of taxes, or PILTs, are 
Federal payments to local govern-
ments to help offset losses in property 
taxes due to the presence of nontaxable 
Federal lands within their boundaries. 
Through my role on the Energy and 
Water Development, and Related Agen-
cies Appropriations Subcommittee, I 
have gotten to know the good people of 
Pike County, Ohio, where the Depart-
ment of Energy owns 3,700 acres of land 
where a uranium enrichment plant 
once operated. And wouldn’t you know 
it, Pike County has one of the highest 
cancer rates in the State of Ohio. 
Yet, their PILT payment is a paltry 
$47,000 a year. These are the people who 
enriched the uranium during the Cold 
War; they live in southern Ohio where 
corporations have gone in, extracted 
resources, and taken the profits out, 
and now we need to help this commu-
nity get the kind of payment that they 
need. For all the radiation, all the sac-
rifice that they have made and endured 
over the years, it is long past time that 
the Federal Government increased the 
PILT payment for Pike County, Ohio.

RECOGNIZING DR. DAVID WAGNER 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Venango Area Chamber Citizen of the 
Year, Dr. David Wagner. 
Dr. Wagner currently owns and oper-
ates the Wagner Family Eye Care in 
Seneca. 
Dr. Wagner is a graduate of North 
Clarion High School, Gannon Univer-
sity, and the Pennsylvania College of 
Optometry. 
Dr. Wagner continues to be an active 
citizen of Venango County. He is dedi-
cated to giving back not only in the 
area but around the world. 
Dr. Wagner currently serves on the 
board for the Oil City Rotary Club and 
the Venango County Association for 
the Blind, in addition to being involved 
in his church, Second Presbyterian. 
Despite staying busy, Dr. Wagner 
finds time to volunteer with other 
community groups, Mr. Speaker, and 
mentors young adults in the area. 
Dr. Wagner continues his service out-
side of Venango by participating in 
Through God’s Eyes and ZUMC to pro-
vide 
eye 
care 
to 
people 
in 
need 
throughout the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dr. Wag-
ner on this tremendous honor and 
thank him for his continued dedication 
to those of Venango County and around 
the world.

THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS 
STRUCK OUT 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, for a year, 
the Biden administration has struck 
out on every jobs report. 
If this were a baseball game, this ad-
ministration would have been benched 
long ago. 
Economists predicted that 450,000 
new jobs would be added in the month 
of December. 
But what was the result? A dismal 
199,000 jobs were added, the worst re-
port of Joe Biden’s Presidency. 
Mr. Speaker, with these kinds of 
numbers, 
America’s 
economy 
and 
workforce will never recover. 
No matter how this administration 
spins these failures, one thing is abun-
dantly clear: You cannot swing, miss, 
and then claim you have hit a home 
run.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN) and the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and to include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery 
Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021, or 
PRRADA, is commonsense legislation 
that would promote greater trans-
parency and integrity with respect to 
the ongoing financial reorganization of 
Puerto Rico. This will be the third 
time in just over 2 years that the 
House will vote on this legislation, but, 
Mr. Speaker, I think the third time 
will be the charm. 
In response to dire fiscal issues fac-
ing Puerto Rico at the time, Congress 
passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Man-
agement, and Economic Stability Act, 
or PROMESA, in 2016. 
That legislation established the Fi-
nancial Oversight and Management 
Board with control over Puerto Rico’s 
budget, laws, financial plans, and regu-
lations, and the authority to retain 
professionals to assist the Board in 
executing its responsibilities. 
Although largely patterned on Chap-
ter 
11 
of 
the 
Bankruptcy 
Code, 
PROMESA did not incorporate all fac-
ets of Chapter 11 and other relevant 
provisions of the code. 
Importantly, this includes the code’s 
mandatory disclosure requirements re-
garding actual or potential conflicts of 
interest that professional persons seek-
ing to be retained in a bankruptcy case 
must make to the court prior to their 
retention. 
This bill would close that loophole by 
conditioning the compensation of pro-
fessional 
persons 
retained 
under 
PROMESA under certain disclosures 
similar to those required under the 
Bankruptcy Code. 
Additionally, the bill would require 
the United States Trustee to review 
these disclosures and to submit com-
ments in response to the court, and it 
also 
authorizes 
the 
United 
States 
Trustee to object to compensation re-
quested by professionals. 
And finally, H.R. 1192 would allow 
courts to deny compensation for serv-
ices and reimbursement of expenses if 
the professional person did not comply 
with the disclosure requirement, was 
not a disinterested person, or rep-
resented or held an interest adverse to 
the bankruptcy estate. Common sense. 
The House passed H.R. 1192 last Feb-
ruary, 
and 
the 
Senate 
passed 
an 
amended version of the Act last De-
cember. 
The 
Senate 
amendments 
streamlined PRRADA’s reporting re-
quirements, strengthened the incen-
tives for good faith compliance, and 
clarify other provisions of the Act. 
Now, Puerto Rico’s restructuring is 
drawing to a close, which makes pas-
sage of this legislation especially ur-
gent. 
I thank Representative VELA´ ZQUEZ 
for her leadership in championing this 
bill and for her relentless dedication to 
ensuring that the people of Puerto Rico 
receive the fair, efficient, and trans-
parent restructuring process they de-
serve. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, which was passed out of the House 
last year and the year before by unani-
mous votes, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 1192, the Puerto 
Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures 
Act of 2021. 
In 2016, Puerto Rico was experiencing 
severe financial pressure from signifi-
cant debt and related obligations. 
In response to Puerto Rico’s financial 
distress, Congress enacted the Puerto 
Rico Oversight, Management, and Eco-
nomic Stability Act of 2016. That 2016 
law created a bankruptcy process for 
Puerto Rico. 
Like existing bankruptcy law in 2016, 
the law permitted certain professionals 
working on Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy, 
like lawyers and accountants, to apply 
to get paid for their services pending 
judicial approval. 
But the 2016 law lacked certain dis-
closure requirements for these profes-
sionals that would typically apply to 
restructuring professionals in other 
bankruptcy cases. 
The gap in the 2016 law created the 
potential for undisclosed conflicts of 
interest for professionals involved in 
Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy. 
This bill fills the gap by mandating 
the necessary disclosure requirements. 
The bill also establishes a process for 
overseeing 
and 
policing 
disclosures 
that bankruptcy professionals make. 
H.R. 1192 passed the House unani-
mously in February of 2021. In Decem-
ber, the Senate passed H.R. 1192 with a 
few minor amendments to improve the 
bill’s 
administrative 
abilities. 
The 
amendments also enhanced the incen-
tives for professionals to make signifi-
cant efforts to comply with the new 
disclosure requirements. 
H.R. 1192 will serve important goals 
and interests, including the interests of 
creditors and taxpayers and Puerto 
Rico itself. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of the approval in 
the House of the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery 
Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021. 
I joined Representative VELA´ ZQUEZ to 
promote this bipartisan and common-
sense bill to help ensure the restruc-
turing process under PROMESA serves 
Puerto Rico’s interests. Actually, just

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H232 
January 19, 2022 
this week, the plan was approved by 
the Federal Court, so this is perfect 
timing to approve this bill today. 
Though it required some technical 
corrections, it is satisfying to see this 
bill has already achieved passage in 
both Chambers. I wish for my col-
league, Congresswoman VELA´ ZQUEZ, to 
be fully recovered in time to see it be-
come law. 
The intent of this legislation remains 
the same, and this bill will require any 
person or firm hired as legal, financial 
or technical staff or consultants for the 
Financial Oversight Board in the court 
cases for the restructuring of Puerto 
Rico’s debt, to submit verified disclo-
sures of all connections with debtors, 
creditors, or other interested parties in 
the process, before being compensated. 
Our intention is not to exclude peo-
ple with experience in Puerto Rico’s fi-
nancial transactions from being re-
sources in the restructuring process, 
but it is essential that their connection 
to any parties interested in those 
transactions be known. Conflict of in-
terest, or the appearance of conflict of 
interest, can be best avoided if there is 
accountability and transparency. 
Anyone 
working 
to 
inform 
the 
Board’s decisions, or representing it be-
fore the court, needs to be committed 
to defending the interests of the people 
of Puerto Rico first, in accordance with 
the law and justice. 
Lack of transparency creates a lack 
of trust, and this bill will work toward 
avoiding that by making these disclo-
sures a legal mandate rather than the 
Board’s own discretion. 
Our goal is to reach the day we no 
longer 
need 
the 
provisions 
of 
PROMESA and the Oversight Board, 
but until that happens, these instru-
ments must be accountable and trans-
parent. 
I ask my colleagues to support the 
passage of the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery 
Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021. 
b 1230 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
just reiterate that I think there is a lot 
of support in the Chamber, and I sup-
port it as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, in closing, 
H.R. 1192 closes a loophole under cur-
rent law by establishing disclosure re-
quirements regarding actual or poten-
tial conflicts of interest in the bank-
ruptcy process under PROMESA. In 
doing so, this legislation promotes 
transparency and accountability in the 
Puerto Rico restructuring process. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
VELA´ ZQUEZ from New York, the author 
of the bill, for her leadership on this 
issue, and I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this commonsense 
measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Senate Amendment to 
H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery Accu-
racy in Disclosures Act of 2021. I was proud 
to introduce this bill with bipartisan support in 
the House. I would like to thank House Speak-
er NANCY PELOSI and Chairman JERRY NADLER 
for bringing this legislation to the floor and to 
Senator BOB MENENDEZ for introducing a com-
panion bill in the Senate and for his tireless ef-
forts to make sure this Bill would get approved 
in the Senate. 
H.R. 1192 already unanimously passed this 
House back on February 24, 2021 and I ex-
pect to do so the same today. 
The Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Dis-
closures Act of 2021 or ‘‘PRRADA’’ eliminates 
a double standard currently facing Puerto 
Rico. Under U.S. Code and Federal Bank-
ruptcy procedure, any conflicts of interest—or 
even the perception of such conflict—between 
those working on the bankruptcy and the debt-
or are required to be disclosed. 
However, a loophole in the current law pre-
vents this requirement from being extended to 
the people of Puerto Rico. 
In 2016, Congress passed the Puerto Rico 
Oversight, Management, and Economic Sta-
bility Act, otherwise known as PROMESA. 
When PROMESA was originally passed, it in-
corporated Chapter 11’s bankruptcy require-
ment that professionals file fee applications 
with the court. But PROMESA did not include 
Chapter 11’s disclosure requirements that go 
hand-in-hand with those fee applications. 
PRRADA remedies this and makes sure that 
professionals paid by the taxpayers of Puerto 
Rico are fully transparent about what interests 
they are serving. 
Puerto Ricans should be confident that the 
Board’s bankruptcy advisors do not have their 
‘‘thumb on the scale’’ to favor certain debts 
where they have a self-interest. This bipartisan 
bill ensures integrity and transparency of the 
PROMESA process. 
While we can have differing opinions on 
how effectively the Oversight Board is carrying 
out its mission, one thing should be clear—the 
island’s residents should be entitled to the 
same rights and protections as any debtor on 
the mainland. 
Once more, I would like to thank Chairman 
NADLER, the Committee Staff and the bipar-
tisan cosponsors of this bill. I strongly encour-
age all members to vote ‘‘Yes’’ on this critical 
piece of legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. DEAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the bill, H.R. 1192. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the Senate 
amendment was concurred in. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GHOST ARMY CONGRESSIONAL 
GOLD MEDAL ACT 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
1404) to award a Congressional Gold 
Medal to the 23d Headquarters Special 
Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company, popularly known as the 
‘‘Ghost Army’’, in recognition of their 
unique and highly distinguished service 
in conducting deception operations in 
Europe during World War II. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1404 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ghost Army 
Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the 23d Headquarters Special Troops 
(comprised of the 23d Headquarters and 
Headquarters Company, Special Troops, the 
603d Engineer Camouflage Battalion, the 
406th Combat Engineer Company, the 3132d 
Signal Service Company, and the Signal 
Company, Special, 23d Headquarters, Special 
Troops) and the 3133d Signal Service Com-
pany were units of the United States Army 
that served in Europe during World War II; 
(2) the 23d Headquarters Special Troops 
was actively engaged in battlefield oper-
ations from June of 1944 through March of 
1945; 
(3) the 3133d Signal Service Company was 
engaged in operations in Italy in 1945; 
(4) the deceptive activities of these units 
were integral to several Allied victories 
across Europe and reduced casualties; 
(5) in evaluating the performance of these 
units after World War II, an Army analysis 
found that ‘‘Rarely, if ever, has there been a 
group of such a few men which had so great 
an influence on the outcome of a major mili-
tary campaign.’’; 
(6) many Ghost Army soldiers were citizen- 
soldiers recruited from art schools, adver-
tising agencies, communications companies, 
and other creative and technical professions; 
(7) the first 4 members of the 23d Head-
quarters Special Troops landed on D-Day and 
2 became casualties while creating false 
beach landing sites; 
(8) a detachment of Army radio operators 
under the command of Lieutenant Fred Fox 
joined the invasion fleet for a planned decep-
tion, Operation Troutfly, which was can-
celled; 
(9) Lieutenant Fox’s men and their radios 
were instead attached to the 82d Airborne, 
which had lost 95 percent of its radio equip-
ment, providing critical communications as 
the 82d Airborne fought its way inland; 
(10) the secret deception operations of the 
23d Headquarters Special Troops commenced 
in France on June 14, 1944, when Task Force 
Mason, a 16-man detachment of the 23d led 
by First Lieutenant Bernard Mason, arrived 
in Normandy; 
(11) Lieutenant Mason and his men set up 
dummy artillery to draw enemy fire and pro-
tect the 980th Field Artillery Battalion (VIII 
Corps) as part of the Normandy Campaign; 
(12) the rest of the soldiers of the 23d Head-
quarters Special Troops arrived in France in 
July and August of 1944; 
(13) full-scale deception efforts began with 
Operation Elephant from July 1 to 4, 1944, in 
which the 23d Headquarters Special Troops 
covered the movement of the 2d Armored Di-
vision when it left a reserve position to go 
into the line between the First United States 
and Second British Armies;

(14) Operation Elephant was the first of the 
21 full-scale tactical deceptions completed by 
the 23d Headquarters Special Troops; 
(15) often operating on or near the front 
lines, the 23d Headquarters Special Troops 
used inflatable tanks, artillery, airplanes 
and other vehicles, advanced engineered 
soundtracks, and skillfully crafted radio 
trickery to create the illusion of sizable 
American forces where there were none and 
to draw the enemy away from Allied troops; 
(16) the 3132d and the 3133d Signal Service 
Companies, activated in Pine Camp (now 
Fort Drum), New York, at the Army Experi-
mental Station in March and June of 1944, 
respectively, were the only ‘‘sonic decep-
tion’’ ground combat units of the United 
States in World War II; 
(17) soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Spe-
cial Troops impersonated other, larger Army 
units by sewing counterfeit patches onto 
their uniforms, painting false markings on 
their vehicles, and creating phony head-
quarters staffed by fake generals, all in an 
effort to feed false information to Axis spies; 
(18) during the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d 
Headquarters Special Troops created coun-
terfeit radio traffic in an effort to deceive 
the enemy of the movement of elements of 
General George S. Patton’s Third Army as it 
shifted to break through to the 101st Air-
borne Division and elements of 10th Armored 
Division in the besieged Belgian town of Bas-
togne; 
(19) in its final mission, Operation Viersen, 
in March 1945, the 23d Headquarters Special 
Troops conducted a tactical deception oper-
ation intended to draw German units down 
the Rhine River and away from the Ninth 
Army, allowing the Ninth Army to cross the 
Rhine into Germany; 
(20) during Operation Viersen, the 23d 
Headquarters Special Troops, with the as-
sistance of other units, impersonated 2 com-
plete divisions of American forces by using 
fabricated radio networks, soundtracks of 
construction work and artillery fire, and 
hundreds of inflatable and real vehicles; 
(21) according to a military intelligence of-
ficer of the 79th Infantry, ‘‘There is no doubt 
that Operation Viersen materially assisted 
in deceiving the enemy with regard to the 
real dispositions and intentions of this 
Army.’’; 
(22) 3 soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Spe-
cial Troops gave their lives and dozens were 
injured in carrying out their mission; 
(23) in April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service 
Company conducted Operation Craftsman in 
support of Operation Second Wind, the suc-
cessful Allied effort to break through the 
German defensive position to the north of 
Florence, Italy, known as the Gothic Line; 
(24) along with an attached platoon of Brit-
ish engineers, who were inflatable decoy spe-
cialists, the 3133d Signal Service Company 
used sonic deception to misrepresent troop 
locations along this defensive line; 
(25) the activities of the 23d Headquarters 
Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company remained highly classified for 
more than 40 years after the war and re-
ceived minimal recognition; 
(26) the extraordinary accomplishments of 
this unit are deserving of belated official rec-
ognition; and 
(27) the United States is eternally grateful 
to the soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Spe-
cial Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company for their proficient use of innova-
tive tactics during World War II, which saved 
lives and made significant contributions to 
the defeat of the Axis powers.

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks on this 
legislation and to insert extraneous 
material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of S. 1404, the Ghost Army Con-
gressional Gold Medal Act. I thank the 
gentleman from Massachusetts, Sen-
ator MARKEY, and the gentlewoman 
from New Hampshire, Congresswoman 
KUSTER, for their work on this bill 
which 
honors 
the 
resourcefulness, 
imagination, and artistry of the men of 
the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops 
and the 3133rd Signal Company in con-
ducting deception operations in Europe 
during World War II. 
This 1,100-man unit, known collec-
tively as the Ghost Army, was made up 
of individuals recruited from creative 
fields, including art schools, theater 
and communications companies, and 
advertising agencies. Their mission 
was to draw upon their creative and ar-
tistic talents to lure the German Army 
away from the Allied combat units 
through a series of tactical deception 
operations meant to confuse, deceive, 
and mislead. 
Following 
the 
D-Day 
landing 
in 
France, the Ghost Army undertook a 
traveling road show utilizing fake 
radio transmissions, inflatable tanks, 
and theatrical sound and atmospheric 
effects to misdirect German units away 
from actual Allied unit locations and 
toward larger imaginary ones. 
The artists, architects, and engineers 
of the Ghost Army were so effective 
that a later Army analysis of their per-
formance found that ‘‘rarely, if ever, 
has there been a group of such few men 
which had so great an influence on the 
outcome of a major military cam-
paign.’’ 
Yet, despite the overwhelming suc-
cess of the citizen soldiers of the Ghost 
Army, their contributions remained 
classified for over 40 years, and their 
bravery and ingenuity was never for-
mally recognized. 
This bill honors their unique con-
tributions to the war effort by direct-
ing the Mint to strike a gold medal in 
honor of the Ghost Army. The gold 
medal shall be given to the Smithso-
nian Institution, where it will be avail-
able for display and serve as recogni-
tion of the incredible service of the 
men of the Ghost Army during World 
War II. 
I thank Mr. MARKEY and Ms. KUSTER 
for their work on this bill, and I urge 
Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
1404, the Ghost Army Congressional 
Gold Medal Act, the Senate version of 
H.R. 707, which the House passed in 
May 2021. 
The Ghost Army, comprised of the 
23rd Headquarters Special Troops, is 
renowned for creating large-scale de-
ception operations capable of pulling 
Axis focus away from the actual move-
ments of the Allied forces.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H234 
January 19, 2022 
During the early phases of World War 
II, the 23rd division mastered their 
skill of deception by studying unit at-
mosphere and collecting materials for 
their new special effects tactics. 
Knowing that enemy ground agents 
looked for vehicle bumper markings, 
Allied shoulder patches, and well-de-
fined checkpoints, the 23rd collected 
shoulder patches for phony major gen-
erals, created realistic inflatable vehi-
cles and artillery, and even recorded 
the sounds of heavy machinery move-
ments to sell their deception. They 
built their own modern-day Trojan 
horse, down to the last detail. 
The Ghost Army, unlike many other 
units, was comprised of civilian sol-
diers with a proclivity for art, archi-
tecture, acting, set design, and engi-
neering. 
As Jack Masey, who was recruited 
into the Ghost Army at age 18, remem-
bered: ‘‘We were told we were going to 
be using inflatable equipment to try 
and fool the Germans into thinking 
that we were a real army, when we 
were, in effect, I suppose, a rubber 
army.’’ 
b 1245 
Anyone who has watched a History 
Channel World War II documentary has 
undoubtedly seen the Ghost Army in 
action. The historic videos and hercu-
lean photos of four men holding a tank 
over their heads is a testament to the 
Ghost Army’s ingenuity and bravery 
during World War II. 
The 23rd did not limit their deception 
to the battlefield. In fact, on numerous 
occasions Ghosters were dispatched to 
French cafes near the front of the war 
to order some omelets and talk loose 
among the spies who might be there. 
The 23rd would go to great lengths to 
cause chaos and confusion, and they 
succeeded. 
Mr. Speaker, recognizing these true 
American heroes hits close to home for 
me, as the 77th Ghost Army veterans 
originated from the great State of Ken-
tucky. 
There is no doubt that the Ghost 
Army saved thousands of lives during 
World War II. Their unique and highly 
distinguished service during this great 
war should be recognized with a Con-
gressional Gold Medal. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Ms. KUSTER, for her leadership on this, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. I yield 41⁄2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
New 
Hampshire 
(Ms. KUSTER). 
Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a group of veterans 
who have gone unrecognized for far too 
long. 
In World War II, top secret units 
known as the Ghost Army used combat 
deception to literally fool the Nazis. 
Their mission to was to divert enemy 
forces away from American combat 
units so that our troops faced less re-
sistance. This required creativity and a 
special kind of courage. 
Whereas a typical American unit had 
tanks made of steel, the Ghost Army, 
as you have heard from my colleagues, 
Mr. BARR and Ms. DEAN, built tanks 
made of rubber and wood. Using inflat-
able equipment and sonic deception, 
the Ghost Army made it appear as if 
there were tens of thousands of combat 
troops when there were literally none. 
If the Germans ever discovered this 
ruse, the Ghost Army would have been 
annihilated. Throughout the war, the 
Ghost Army took this risk and, using 
their creativity and artistic talents, 
played a decisive role in Allied combat 
operations. 
As Mr. BARR noted, in evaluating the 
performance of these units after World 
War II, an Army analysis found rarely, 
if ever, has there been a group of such 
few men who had such great influence 
on the outcome of a major military 
campaign. I might note that was the 
campaign that turned the tide of World 
War II. 
To this day, combat deception units 
in the Army learn about the tactics 
that were used by the Ghost Army so 
many years ago. In this sense, the 
brave actions of the Ghost Army still 
are keeping Americans safe to this day. 
The Ghost Army’s combat deceptions 
were so effective that the Army kept 
them classified for over 40 years after 
the war. Because of this classification, 
the great men of the Ghost Army were 
never properly recognized for their her-
oism and contributions to defeating 
fascism in Europe. 
Mr. Speaker, as noted, the House 
passed the Ghost Army Congressional 
Gold Medal Act that I introduced last 
spring. The Senate is now asking pas-
sage of the companion bill, S. 1404, in-
troduced by Mr. MARKEY. This would 
right the wrong by awarding the Con-
gressional Gold Medal to those living 
members of the Ghost Army. We will 
recognize the families of those who 
have passed. 
I am proud that 75 years after their 
service, the Ghost Army is finally get-
ting some of the recognition it earned. 
I also want to take a moment to rec-
ognize the contributions of so many in-
dividuals in getting this bill over the 
finish line. 
First, I want to thank my colleague, 
Representative STEWART, and his staff 
for dedicating themselves to this bill. 
I also want to recognize a good friend 
of 
mine, 
Rick 
Beyer, 
and 
Roy 
Eichhorn. These two historians helped 
rediscover the Ghost Army’s story and 
share it with the world. 
Finally, I want to recognize all of the 
members of the Ghost Army Legacy 
Project. This coalition, made up large-
ly of family members of Ghost Army 
veterans, worked tirelessly to help 
Representative STEWART and myself se-
cure the 292 House cosponsors nec-
essary to pass this bill. 
It is a testament to this institution 
that a handful of passionate citizens, 
without the help of any special interest 
groups or lobbyists, can build the sup-
port necessary to send this legislation 
to President Biden’s desk. So it is fit-
ting that we pass this bill today. 
Of the more than 16 million Ameri-
cans who served in World War II, bare-
ly more than 240,000 are still alive, in-
cluding just nine members of the Ghost 
Army. We should never forget the con-
tributions of the Ghost Army and all 
the servicemembers in World War II to 
preserve democracy around the world. 
This is personal for me because my 
father, Malcolm McLane, was a fighter 
pilot and a POW during World War II. 
While today we rightfully single out 
the brave actions of the Ghost Army, I 
hope we also take a moment to remem-
ber all of our World War II veterans. 
In closing, I want to note what made 
the Ghost Army special was not just 
their extraordinary courage but their 
creativity. Their story reminds us that 
listening to unconventional ideas, like 
using visual and sound deception, can 
help us solve existential challenges 
like defeating tyranny. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the bill. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend and colleague from Pennsyl-
vania. I thank my friend and colleague 
from New Hampshire. 
I would just reiterate the signifi-
cance of the Ghost Army. I thank my 
colleagues for recognizing these ex-
traordinary members of the Greatest 
Generation and their significant con-
tributions to our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 1404, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
On a personal note, I would like to 
recognize First Lieutenant Bernard 
Mason, mentioned in the text of this 
bill, for his leadership in leading the 16- 
man detachment of the 23rd Head-
quarters Special Troops during the in-
vasion of Normandy. Lieutenant Mason 
was a constituent of mine before his 
passing, and his wife and children still 
live in my district. I want to thank 
them for Lieutenant Mason’s life and 
service. Today we are finally honoring 
his service and those of his brothers-in- 
arms in perpetuity. 
The stories of the creativity and in-
novation displayed by the members of 
the Ghost Army during World War II 
read like something straight out of a 
Hollywood blockbuster script. The only 
thing missing is a Hollywood ending 
where the brave members of the Ghost 
Army are finally recognized for their 
lifesaving contributions to defeating 
the Axis Powers during World War II. 
This bill ensures official recognition 
for this heroic group of citizen soldiers 
and their unique contributions to the 
war effort. 
I thank Mr. MARKEY and Ms. KUSTER, 
the lead sponsor of the House version 
of this bill, for ensuring that the sto-
ries of these men of the Ghost Army re-
ceive the recognition they deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

WILLIE O’REE CONGRESSIONAL 
GOLD MEDAL ACT 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
452) to award a Congressional Gold 
Medal to Willie O’Ree, in recognition 
of his extraordinary contributions and 
commitment to hockey, inclusion, and 
recreational opportunity. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 452 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Willie O’Ree 
Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Willie O’Ree was the first Black player 
to compete in the National Hockey League 
(NHL), appearing for the Boston Bruins on 
January 18, 1958, in the throes of the civil 
rights movement in the United States help-
ing to end racial segregation in the premier 
professional ice hockey league; he is widely 
referred to as the ‘‘Jackie Robinson of Hock-
ey’’. 
(2) Willie O’Ree was born October 15, 1935, 
in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada; he 
is the youngest of 13 children and a descend-
ant of Paris O’Ree, whose name appears in 
the famous historical document ‘‘The Book 
of Negroes’’. 
(3) Willie O’Ree was raised by his parents 
in Fredericton, a predominantly White town 
where hockey was deeply rooted within the 
culture. O’Ree was a standout athlete on the 
ice and the baseball diamond. 
(4) At age 21, O’Ree was being scouted by 
professional baseball teams and seriously 
considered baseball as a career. Upon experi-
encing the segregated South for the first 
time while appearing for a minor league try-
out, his dream changed and his attention 
turned solely to ice hockey. 
(5) While playing amateur hockey, Willie 
was struck in his right eye with a puck and 
lost his eyesight. He was told by doctors to 
abandon his hockey career; instead, never 
disclosing the extent of his injury, he pur-
sued his dream of playing professional hock-
ey. 
(6) At the age of 22, O’Ree was called up 
from the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Hockey 
League (QHL) to play for the NHL’s Boston 
Bruins at a time when only 6 teams existed 
in the league. O’Ree was unaware he had bro-
ken the color barrier at the top level of the 
sport until he read it in the newspaper the 
following day. 
(7) Blind in 1 eye and a victim of racism at 
times throughout his career, O’Ree per-
severed and played professional hockey for 22 
years, tallying over 1,000 points. 
(8) In 1996, 17 years after O’Ree retired 
from 
professional 
hockey, 
the 
National 
Hockey League hired O’Ree as the first-ever 
Diversity 
Ambassador. 
Having 
already 
changed the game forever through his cour-
age and convictions, O’Ree gives new defini-
tion to what it means to be a trailblazer. 
(9) In this role as Diversity Ambassador 
with the NHL, O’Ree set out to grow the 
sport by providing access, opportunity, and 
motivation 
for 
children 
of 
all 
races, 
ethnicities, origins, and abilities. With O’Ree 
providing a vivid example of what is possible 
and serving as a relentless supporter of chil-
dren pursuing their dreams, more than 30 
nonprofit youth organizations, dubbed Hock-
ey is for Everyone programs, were developed 
across North America, each committed to of-
fering minority and underserved children an 
opportunity to play hockey, leveraging the 
sport to build character, foster positive val-
ues, and develop important life skills. 
(10) Through Hockey is for Everyone pro-
grams, more than 120,000 boys and girls have 
been positively impacted. O’Ree has devoted 
nearly 2,500 days on the ground with the 
youth participants, visiting more than 500 
schools, community centers, and rinks to 
speak to hockey’s core values and beliefs: 
stay in school; set goals for yourself; remain 
committed and disciplined; and always re-
spect your teammates, coaches, and parents. 
(11) Hockey is for Everyone programs have 
provided important opportunities for youth 
to partake in physical fitness. Today in the 
United States, fewer than half of the chil-
dren ages 6–11 engage in the recommended 
amount of physical activity, and that num-
ber is lower for low-income families. O’Ree 
has stood as a champion of youth athletic 
participation and its health benefits for dec-
ades. 
(12) Hockey is for Everyone programs pro-
vide numerous off-ice services to youth: SAT 
and academic tutoring, mentoring, nutrition 
education, college counseling, community 
service opportunities, and more. The pro-
gram has excelled at using hockey as a vehi-
cle to improve the social and emotional 
wellness of youth and improve students’ aca-
demic performances both in primary school 
and beyond. 
(13) O’Ree was also named a Member of the 
Order of Canada in 2008 and, in 2018, the City 
of Boston released an official Proclamation 
recognizing January 18, the anniversary of 
the day he broke into the game, as ‘‘Willie 
O’Ree Day’’. 
(14) In November 2018, 60 years after O’Ree 
entered the NHL, he was inducted into the 
Hockey Hall of Fame in the ‘‘builder’’ cat-
egory in recognition of his efforts to grow 
the game, using his position and the plat-
form of hockey to improve the lives of chil-
dren throughout North America. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the award, on 
behalf of the Congress, of a single gold medal

tions and commitment to hockey, inclusion, 
and recreational opportunity. 
(b) DESIGN

poses of the award referred to in subsection 
(a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter 
in this Act referred to as the ‘‘Secretary’’) 
shall strike the gold medal with suitable em-
blems, devices, and inscriptions, to be deter-
mined by the Secretary. The design shall 
bear an image of, and an inscription of the 
name of, Willie O’Ree. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary may strike 
and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold 
medal struck under section 3, at a price suf-
ficient to cover the costs of the medals, in-
cluding labor, materials, dies, use of machin-
ery, and overhead expenses. 
(b) PROCEEDS OF SALES.—The amounts re-
ceived from the sale of duplicate medals 
under subsection (a) shall be deposited in the 
United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. 
(c) AUTHORITY
TO USE FUND AMOUNTS.— 
There is authorized to be charged against the 
United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund 
such amounts as may be necessary to pay for 
the costs of the medals struck under this 
Act. 
SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS. 
(a) NATIONAL MEDAL.—The medals struck 
pursuant to this Act are national medals for 
purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United 
States Code. 
(b) NUMISMATIC
ITEMS.—For purposes of 
section 5134 of title 31, United States Code, 
all medals struck under this Act shall be 
considered to be numismatic items. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks on this 
legislation and to insert extraneous 
material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 452, the Willie O’Ree Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act. 
I thank Michigan Senator STABENOW 
and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
QUIGLEY) for their work on this bill 
which honors Willie O’Ree, a trail-
blazer for diversity and inclusion in 
sports and the first Black player in the 
National Hockey League. 
Born in 1935 in the predominantly 
White town of Fredericton, New Bruns-
wick, Canada, O’Ree made a name for 
himself as a standout athlete in both 
ice hockey and baseball. At age 21, he 
was being scouted by professional base-
ball teams in the United States. How-
ever, upon experiencing racial dis-
crimination and the effects of segrega-
tion firsthand while in the south for 
minor league tryouts, he shifted his 
focus solely to ice hockey. 
In 1958, at the age of 22, O’Ree was 
called up to play professionally as a 
winger for the NHL Boston Bruins. In 
doing so, he became the first Black 
professional ice hockey player in the 
league. Despite being blind in one eye 
from an injury during his time as an 
amateur hockey player and enduring 
racist attacks from hockey fans and 
players alike, O’Ree persevered and 
continued to play professional hockey 
for 22 years. 
In 1996, the National Hockey League 
hired O’Ree as its first-ever diversity 
ambassador, which set out to trans-
form the predominantly White sport of 
ice hockey by providing greater access 
and opportunity for children of all 
races, ethnicities, and origins.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H236 
January 19, 2022 
O’Ree has personally devoted thou-
sands of hours to Hockey is for Every-
one programs which provide commu-
nity outreach and support for youth 
participants to partake in physical fit-
ness and live out hockey’s core values 
of commitment, discipline, and respect 
for your teammates, coaches, and par-
ents. 
In 2018, 60 years after O’Ree first 
broke the color barrier for ice hockey, 
he was inducted into the NHL Hockey 
Hall of Fame in recognition of his long-
standing support for greater access and 
diversity in the sport. 
This bill honors O’Ree’s trailblazing 
legacy both on and off the ice. I thank 
Ms. STABENOW
and Mr. QUIGLEY
for 
their work on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge members to vote 
‘‘yes’’ and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of S. 452, the Willie 
O’Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act. 
Willie O’Ree’s story is one of deter-
mination and perseverance, one of the 
greatest qualities a human being can 
have. 
Willie, born October 15, 1935, was the 
youngest of 13 children of parents 
Rosebud and Harry O’Ree. The O’Ree 
family was one of only two Black fami-
lies that lived in Fredericton, New 
Brunswick. Willie is a descendent of 
Paris O’Ree, a slave who escaped ser-
vitude in South Carolina in the late 
1700s at only 15 years old. 
When he was 3, Willie fashioned 
skates out of wooden blocks with metal 
blades attached to the bottom and took 
to his frozen lawn in the backyard. He 
had a knack for skating. Two years 
later at age 5, Willie began to play or-
ganized hockey. Many refer to Willie as 
the ‘‘Jackie Robinson of hockey.’’ 
Interestingly, at Dodger Stadium in 
1949, 2 years after Robinson broke base-
ball’s color barrier, a 14-year-old O’Ree 
had the opportunity to meet his hero. 
In one interview, Willie recalls that as 
Robinson made his way down to the re-
ceiving line, Willie waited patiently. 
When his turn arrived, he spoke to 
Jackie and said, I am a baseball player. 
But what I really love is hockey. 
Robinson replied, Oh, I didn’t know 
Black kids played hockey. 
Nearly 9 years later, on January 18, 
1958, Willie put on a Boston Bruins uni-
form for a game against the Montreal 
Canadians and became the first Black 
player in NHL history. 
b 1300 
From 1958 to 1961, O’Ree played in 45 
games for the Bruins, all while hiding a 
secret that he was, in fact, blind in one 
eye. 
Willie paved the way for a new gen-
eration 
of 
hockey 
players. 
Wayne 
Simmonds of the Toronto Maple Leafs 
was quoted as stating: 
Willie set the table for everyone else to 
eat, and he did it all with dignity and class. 
I used to think about Willie’s story whenever 
teachers or hockey parents or coaches would 
laugh at my dream of making it to the NHL. 
Willie’s story did not end after he left 
the ice. Seventeen years after he re-
tired from professional hockey, the 
NHL hired O’Ree as their first-ever di-
versity 
ambassador. This role put 
Willie in a position to grow the sport 
by providing access, opportunity, and 
motivation for children of all races, 
ethnicities, origins, and abilities. 
In November of 2018, O’Ree was in-
ducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, 
and just last night, 64 years to the day 
of his historic entrance into the league, 
his number 22 jersey was raised to the 
rafters in TD Garden and retired; an 
act of ultimate recognition of what a 
player means to a franchise, a fan base, 
and a community. 
Mr. Speaker, Willie O’Ree forever 
changed the sport of hockey. His deter-
mination and perseverance should be 
recognized with a Congressional Gold 
Medal. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, 2 days 
ago our country took time to celebrate 
the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
and reflect on our ongoing effort to en-
sure racial equality in America. It is 
fitting then that today this body con-
siders legislation to honor the life of 
Willie O’Ree who, like Dr. King, was on 
the frontlines of racial integration in 
America and has dedicated his life to 
the ideals of diversity and inclusion. 
In 1958, Willie O’Ree integrated the 
sport of hockey by becoming the first 
Black player in the National Hockey 
League. Well, known are the stories of 
barrier-breaking athletes like Jackie 
Robinson in baseball and Bill Russell 
in basketball; Mr. O’Ree’s story is less-
er known. 
He was born in Canada, the youngest 
of 13 children. His grandfather, Paris 
O’Ree, escaped slavery in South Caro-
lina and fled to Canada. Growing up in 
Canada, O’Ree quickly developed a love 
and talent for hockey. During his early 
years playing hockey, he was blinded 
in one eye by a stray puck. However, 
this setback did not deter him from his 
dream of playing professional hockey. 
A few years later, Willie finally got the 
call to play in the NHL with the Bos-
ton Bruins, becoming the first Black 
player to do so. 
But the road ahead was not an easy 
one. During his time playing for the 
Bruins, Willie endured racist slurs by 
fans and opposing teams. He suffered il-
legal hits and rough treatment con-
stantly. But that was not enough to 
deter him. He remained committed to 
playing hockey and would do so for 22 
years in the NHL and the minor 
leagues. Think about that, Mr. Speak-
er, he played 22 years of professional 
hockey while enduring racism and big-
otry; oh, and only having vision in one 
eye. 
Willie never intended to stop the 
fight for inclusion in the league once 
he left playing hockey. After hanging 
up his skates, he became the NHL’s di-
versity ambassador, a role he continues 
to this day. 
In the 1990s, he established the Hock-
ey is for Everyone initiative to offer 
marginalized 
and 
underrepresented 
children an opportunity to play hockey 
and develop important life skills. Since 
its inception, more than 120,000 chil-
dren have participated in the program. 
After his remarkable career on and 
off the ice, Willie has begun to receive 
the recognition he has long deserved. 
In 2018, he was inducted into the Hock-
ey Hall of Fame, and just last night, 
his jersey was retired by the Boston 
Bruins. 
It has been my honor to know Willie 
over the past decade and help lead this 
bill to award him a Congressional Gold 
Medal. I am thankful to my colleagues, 
Representatives 
HIGGINS, 
PRESSLEY, 
EMMER, and KATKO, who led this legis-
lation in the House with me, and Sen-
ators STABENOW and SCOTT who led this 
bill in the Senate. 
When I was young, my heroes were 
hockey players. They were talented, 
strong, and skilled. They taught me 
many things. At the time they were all 
White. Willie fought his entire life to 
change that during and after his ca-
reer. Hockey, the sports world, and our 
country are better off because of his ef-
forts. 
I had no idea that the year I was born 
Willie O’Ree broke the color barrier in 
hockey. And it wasn’t until many years 
later when I had the honor of meeting 
him that I learned that my own heroes 
from the Chicago Blackhawks and 
their fans gave him some of the 
harshest treatment during his time in 
the NHL. 
But his life has been a true testa-
ment to those values I learned as a 
young hockey fan: strength, courage, 
and perseverance even in the face of 
tremendous odds. He is a true gift to 
our country and to a sport that I and 
so many others love. Awarding him the 
Congressional Gold Medal will serve as 
a small but important token of our 
country’s gratitude. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield such 
time as he may consume to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER). 
This Member of Congress not only 
played collegiate hockey, he is a hock-
ey dad, and spent over 20 years as a 
hockey coach, he is one of the best fans 
of the game of hockey in the United 
States Congress. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of S. 452, the Willie 
O’Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act, 
and to recognize the incredible impact 
that Willie O’Ree has had on the great 
sport of hockey. 
Willie etched his name into the his-
tory books in 1958. When he became one 
of the select few—and it is a very few— 
who got called up from the minors to 
play in the National Hockey League for 
the Boston Bruins, Willie broke down 
racial barriers for sure. He would go on

to play more than 24 seasons as a pro-
fessional hockey player, despite facing 
countless challenges on and off the ice. 
Willie O’Ree remains a trailblazer for 
many, but his contributions certainly 
did not end after his retirement from 
his playing career in 1979. As we have 
heard, in 1996, he became the NHL’s di-
versity ambassador. In this capacity, 
he established the Hockey is for Every-
one initiative to create a culture of 
inclusivity and provide an opportunity 
for disadvantaged children across this 
country and North America to play the 
game. His work continues even to this 
day to reinvigorate and grow the great 
sport of hockey while setting an exam-
ple for underrepresented communities 
here at home and on an international 
level. 
As the NHL and teams across the 
country 
finally 
recognized 
Willie 
O’Ree’s 
incredible 
contributions 
to 
hockey, today is Congress’ opportunity 
to honor a true legend of the game that 
is loved and enjoyed by millions. 
Remember, we know that hockey was 
given to us directly from God because 
it is played on ice, which can only exist 
in Heaven. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-lead 
this long overdue effort, and I urge all 
my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to honor this icon of our 
God-given sport by voting ‘‘yes’’ on S. 
452. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of our bill, the Willie 
O’Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act, 
legislation which honors the historic 
career and life of service of the one and 
only Willie O’Ree. 
With today’s vote in the people’s 
House, we honor a giant, and it has 
been an honor to be a steward in this 
effort. Willie is a trailblazer, an ice 
breaker, a hero, and an activist whose 
powerful story is unknown to too 
many. That ends here today. We 
change that. 
Mr. Speaker, 64 years ago, in the 
midst of the fight to end Jim Crow, 
Willie O’Ree made history with the 
Boston Bruins by becoming the first 
Black player to play in the National 
Hockey League. 
A descendant of enslaved people who 
escaped the horrors of slavery through 
the Underground Railroad, Willie was 
born and raised in New Brunswick, 
Canada, and was the youngest of 13 
children. His love of the game began at 
the young age of 3 when he earned his 
stripes playing alongside his older sib-
lings. 
Known as the Jackie Robinson of 
hockey, Willie played 45 games in the 
NHL and spent more than two decades 
playing professional hockey—all while 
hiding the fact that he was nearly com-
pletely bind in one eye. 
Willie O’Ree was a young and fast 
left winger, but he could not out-skate 
the racist backlash in response to his 
desegregating the National Hockey 
League. As the sole Black player in the 
NHL at the time, Willie endured relent-
less bigotry, racism, discrimination, 
and even violence from fans and play-
ers both on and off the ice. And despite 
it 
all, 
Willie 
embodied 
resilience, 
grace, dignity, and never gave up on 
the determination to live out his 
dream. 
In the decades following his historic 
career on the ice, Willie has spent his 
time paying it forward to the next gen-
eration of ice breakers. As the NHL’s 
director of youth development and di-
versity ambassador, he has worked to 
increase opportunities for young Black 
and Brown players so that they too can 
take their rightful place in the big 
league. 
In 2018, Willie was formally inducted 
into the NHL Hall of Fame; and while 
his time with the Boston Bruins was 
short, his legacy lives on to this very 
day. Earlier this week, Mayor Michelle 
Wu declared January 18 in the city of 
Boston Willie O’Ree Day marking the 
momentous day 64 years ago when 
Willie hit the ice and changed the 
game forever. 
Just yesterday, the Boston Bruins 
formally retired Willie’s number 22 jer-
sey, raising it up in the rafters at the 
Garden alongside other Bruins legends. 
Mr. Speaker, Black history is Amer-
ican history, and today we salute an 
American hero and inspiration. Willie 
demonstrates for us the power of hold-
ing on to one’s dreams—an ice and ceil-
ing breaker. 
I would like to thank my esteemed 
colleagues, 
Representatives 
Quigley, 
Katko, and Emmer, for their partner-
ship, and the 290 colleagues who co-
sponsored this piece of legislation in 
order to get it across the finish line. 
My team and I have been working dili-
gently pushing and organizing since 
2019, and this work would not have 
been possible without the support and 
partnership of the longtime grassroots 
activists who organized to ensure that 
Willie, who took up space and who cre-
ated space, now takes his rightful 
space in our history books. 
The Congressional Gold Medal is Con-
gress’ highest expression of national 
appreciation and recognition. With this 
honor, Willie will join history-makers 
like Jackie Robinson, the Reverend Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta 
Scott King, and the Tuskegee Airmen— 
incredible company for an incredible 
man. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentlewoman from Massachusetts an 
additional 1 minute. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, at the 
age of 86 years young today, we give 
Willie O’Ree his flowers. 
Go Bruins. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I would just 
like to, once again, reiterate the sig-
nificance of this Congressional Gold 
Medal. Willie O’Ree not only forever 
changed the sport of hockey, but he 
truly helped change the history of this 
country. His determination and perse-
verance and his trailblazing spirit 
should be recognized with a Congres-
sional Gold Medal. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 
452, the Willie O’Ree Congressional 
Gold Medal Act. 
Willie O’Ree, which has been already 
said, was a trailblazer for hockey both 
on and off the ice. He was to the Na-
tional Hockey League what Jackie 
Robinson was to Major League Base-
ball. 
As the first Black player in the Na-
tional Hockey League, he endured rac-
ism, bigotry, and prejudice from both 
players and fans. Despite this, he 
played more than two decades in the 
National Hockey League and in the 
minor leagues developing his skills and 
later becoming the National Hockey 
League’s diversity ambassador. 
Willie O’Ree broke down historic bar-
riers and paved the way for young ath-
letes in marginalized communities. In 
2012, he visited my community for the 
Willie O’Ree Skills Weekend hosted by 
the National Hockey League Buffalo 
Sabres. Today we honor his dedication 
to improving diversity and accessi-
bility in sports which makes him most 
deserving of this high honor. 
He is an inspiration to all athletes, 
and particularly to young athletes of 
color 
in 
western 
New 
York 
and 
throughout the Nation. I strongly urge 
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation. 
b 1315 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Willie O’Ree is often referred to as 
the ‘‘Jackie Robinson of ice hockey’’ 
for helping to end racial segregation in 
the 
National 
Hockey 
League. 
Mr. 
O’Ree’s positive impact on the sport of 
ice hockey goes far beyond his role in 
ending racial segregation in the sport. 
This bill honors O’Ree for both his 
barrier-breaking role and his decades 
of championing diversity and greater 
youth access to the sport. I thank Ms. 
STABENOW and Mr. QUIGLEY, the lead 
sponsor of the House version of the bill, 
and our other colleagues who worked 
so hard on this bill for ensuring that 
Mr. O’Ree and his trailblazing legacy of 
sportsmanship and inclusion receive 
the recognition he so richly deserves. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. DEAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 452. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays.

ELECTING A MEMBER TO A CER-
TAIN STANDING COMMITTEE OF 
THE 
HOUSE 
OF 
REPRESENTA-
TIVES 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Republican Conference, 
I offer a privileged resolution and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 875 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
ber be, and is hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing standing committee of the House of 
Representatives: 
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS: Mr. Mur-
phy of North Carolina. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
MEDICARE PREMIUM INCREASE 
(Mr. COURTNEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, on 
November 12, Medicare announced the 
largest part B premium increase in the 
history of the Medicare program, 14 
percent. This could not come at a 
worse time in terms of, again, the cost 
of living that many seniors are facing. 
Looking closely at that decision, one 
of the driving factors was the projected 
cost of the drug Aduhelm, which was 
priced at $56,000 per year for Alz-
heimer’s patients who were, again, 
very excited about the possibility of 
getting the benefit of that drug. But 
the cost of that drug was one of the big 
driving forces for a 14 percent rate in-
crease. 
On December 20, Biogen, the manu-
facturer, cut the cost of that drug from 
$56,000 to $28,000. About 2 weeks ago, 
Secretary Becerra correctly instructed 
the actuaries of Medicare to go back 
and try and recalculate the Medicare 
part B premium to see if there was a 
way to get some relief for seniors from 
that 14 percent rate increase. 
Today, 31 Members of the House 
Democratic Caucus are sending a letter 
to Secretary Becerra again applauding 
his decision and strongly advocating 
that Medicare go back in and recal-
culate that rate increase, which will 
provide tremendous assistance for sen-
iors at exactly the time that they need 
it.

HONORING LIEUTENANT MARC 
TOCHTERMAN 
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
honor 
Lieutenant 
Marc 
Tochterman, who is retiring from the 
Bay County Sheriff’s Office after 23 
years. 
Marc also served his country for 22 
years in the Navy before that. 
During his time in the sheriff’s office, 
Lieutenant Tochterman assisted my of-
fice, Representative Gwen Graham’s of-
fice, 
and 
Representative 
Steve 
Southerland’s office, as well. 
Marc also serves as the regional coor-
dinator for the Special Olympics Law 
Enforcement Torch Run and as the vice 
president of the Defenders Motorcycle 
Club’s Panama City Chapter. 
Marc has a heart of gold. 
Marc is a doting father, a loving hus-
band to his wife, Virginia, and, addi-
tionally, a dear friend to me and every-
one on my staff. 
Though we are sad that Marc is retir-
ing, we are proud of the impact he has 
made on our community. 
Madam Speaker, we thank Lieuten-
ant Tochterman and we are all grateful 
for his service. 
f 
IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE JEWISH 
COMMUNITY 
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in solidarity with the Jewish 
community, with Jewish parents, with 
our rabbis, people who are still reeling 
in the aftermath of yet another attack 
on one of their houses of worship. 
Anti-Semitism is real and growing, 
and it is a threat to our neighbors and 
to our collective conscience in this 
country. Paired with near-unfettered 
access to firearms, spaces for online 
hate 
to 
fester, 
and 
the 
echo 
of 
xenophobic dog whistles from our Na-
tion’s highest offices, it has and can 
cost us American lives. 
We have failed when our educators 
and faith leaders need to supplement 
their daily duties with violence inter-
vention rehearsals. We have failed 
when our students and congregants 
need to calculate exit plans upon enter-
ing classrooms and sanctuaries. And we 
have failed when we fear the next at-
tack that impedes our neighbor’s abil-
ity to practice their faith. 
To the Jewish community of Michi-
gan’s 11th District and beyond: I see 
you, I am here for you, and I will con-
tinue to do my part to uproot intoler-
ance and hate wherever it grows. 
f 
RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT JASON 
MOLONEY 
(Ms. VAN DUYNE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Lieutenant 
Jason Moloney and the Southlake Fire 
Department for their selfless acts of 
service to protect our State during the 
recent wildland fire deployments. 
Over the holiday season, Southlake 
Fire Department personnel took part 
in two different deployments as part of 
the Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid 
System to assist with wildland fires in 
the Texas panhandle. The fire covered 
nearly 24,000 acres and stretched 23 
miles long. 
Southlake Fire Department Lieuten-
ant Jason Moloney fearlessly served as 
the Strike Team Leader of a specially 
trained 
team, 
which 
included 
five 
wildland brush trucks and a command 
vehicle. 
During the second deployment, the 
strike team was deployed on January 4 
and was safely demobilized on January 
9. While Lieutenant Moloney was on 
the front line, his wife, Velvet, worked 
tirelessly treating COVID–19 patients 
as a respiratory therapist and taking 
care of their two young children. Both 
Jason and Velvet served to protect our 
State and sacrifice time at home dur-
ing the holidays as a family. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Lieutenant 
Moloney and the entire Southlake Fire 
Department for their dedication, brav-
ery, and providing world class service 
to our community. 
f 
A 
PHENOMENAL 
INTERGENERA-
TIONAL ANNOUNCEMENT 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank President Joe Biden 
and the majority here with some of our 
Republican friends who passed the bi-
partisan infrastructure legislation not 
long ago. 
The Biden administration just an-
nounced this morning three-quarters of 
a billion dollars of investment in the 
Great 
Lakes 
region—an 
awesome 
amount—to take care of projects that 
had been sitting on the shelf for over a 
quarter century, for the modernization 
of the Soo Locks. We could not conduct 
war without those locks being oper-
ational. And they have sat around with 
no investment. 
God bless Joe Biden for his patriot-
ism to this country, and also for what 
is going to happen at Brandon Road 
Lock, south of Chicago, with the bar-
rier that will be built so the Asian carp 
don’t get into the entire Great Lakes 
and eat up all of our native species. 
Three-quarters of a billion dollars in 
the Great Lakes today; what a phe-
nomenal intergenerational announce-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all the 
Members who supported that impor-
tant legislation, and I thank Joe Biden, 
the President of the United States. 
HONORING HARRY SILVER 
(Ms. LETLOW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. LETLOW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Councilman Harry Sil-
ver, a truly distinguished public serv-
ant, as he marks his 100th birthday. 
Harry Silver served the people of Al-
exandria, Louisiana, on the city coun-
cil for more than 15 years before step-
ping down 11 months ago at age 99. At 
an age where most people are slowing 
down and taking it a bit easy, Harry 
stepped up to serve, wanting to give 
back to the community that he called 
home. 
After Harry’s initial appointment in 
2005, the people of Alexandria reelected 
Harry to the council four times. 
At the time of his retirement, Harry 
was both the oldest active elected offi-
cial in the United States and the oldest 
elected official in Louisiana history. 
In his farewell message to the city, 
Harry said: ‘‘Whether you or your par-
ents, 
grandparents, 
or 
great-grand-
parents agreed with me or not over the 
years, I hope everyone agrees that I 
acted only as I felt was best for our 
mutual home. 
Madam Speaker, that is all that we 
can ask of a public servant. 
We are honored and proud to salute 
Harry Silver of Alexandria, Louisiana, 
on his 100th birthday. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SCHOOL 
CHOICE WEEK 
(Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker, 
over this past weekend, the Democratic 
Party in my home State published a 
graphic saying public schools do not 
exist to serve the parents of those stu-
dents and, rightfully, there was an out-
cry before they took it down and dis-
avowed what they posted. 
Parents absolutely have the right to 
know what their kids are learning, and 
over the past year and a half they have 
been fighting back against administra-
tors and unions who have kept students 
out of the classroom. 
When public school teachers in Chi-
cago went on strike earlier this month, 
the phones rang off the hook at the 
city’s private schools as parents finally 
had enough and searched for classroom 
opportunities for their kids. 
Support for parental involvement in 
education and for school choice has 
risen over the past year, and my col-
leagues and I will soon be introducing 
a resolution to honor National School 
Choice Week that will be next week, 
from January 23 through January 29. 
Parents and students should be given 
every opportunity to find a classroom 
where the kids can attend in person, 
see their friends, and learn directly 
from a teacher.

HIGHLIGHTING ISSUES WITH THE 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
ROSS). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 4, 2021, the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, we may be starting a new 
year, but so far the problems remain 
the same. This week marks the 1-year 
anniversary of Joe Biden being sworn 
in as President of the United States, 
and, of course, also the 1-year anniver-
sary of one-party, far-left Democrat 
rule in Washington. 
This past year was one of unprece-
dented crises as a direct result. The 
American people face an economic cri-
sis, an energy crisis, a border crisis, an 
education crisis, a crime crisis, a 
COVID–19 crisis, and a national secu-
rity crisis as a direct result of Joe 
Biden and congressional Democrats’ 
failed leadership and their far-left so-
cialist agenda. 
In this hour, a cross-section of my 
Republican colleagues will address and 
highlight these issues as we stand for 
the opposite policies, and we are very 
anxious to be returned to the majority 
so that we can solve these ongoing di-
lemmas. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, my good friend right 
across the Sabine River, for yielding. 
No President has ever had a worse 
first year in office than Joe Biden. 
And sadly, his deteriorating 42 per-
cent approval rating perfectly mirrors 
the deteriorating state of our country. 
We are facing crises on nearly every 
front, and our Commander in Chief 
who, by the way, is responsible for cre-
ating each and every one of these cri-
ses, is doing absolutely nothing to stop 
them. 
However, the most threatening of 
these concerns is still the unmitigated 
disaster that is raging on our southern 
border. 
More than 1.7 million illegal alien ap-
prehensions happened under Biden’s 
watch last year, and those were just 
the ones that we caught. 
Instead of securing our borders, this 
administration spent all of 2021 sweep-
ing the rule of law under the rug and 
using the cover of darkness to fly thou-
sands of unvetted and untested for 
COVID illegal aliens across the country 
to be released into our neighborhoods. 
How many more innocent women and 
children need to be assaulted, raped, 
and trafficked? 
How many more Americans need to 
overdose on Chinese fentanyl that is 
being smuggled across the border? 
How many more terrorists need to be 
caught trying to infiltrate our Nation? 
What level of threat do we need to 
reach to finally garner some action 
from this President? 
Americans are tired of paying for 
this administration’s ignorance and po-
litical games. 
This is a new year, Mr. President. 
Use it wisely. 
It is past time that you live up to the 
oath that you swore. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, there are so many crises it is 
hard for us to keep count. 
I yield to my dear friend from the 
State of Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI). 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
This week, our Nation is marking a 
solemn anniversary, 49 years since the 
deadly Roe v. Wade decision. 
For nearly half a century, pro-life 
Americans have been standing strong 
to defend precious human life and the 
most vulnerable among us. 
Right now we are facing some tough 
challenges. Under the current one- 
party rule in Washington, Americans 
are witnessing unprecedented attacks 
on pro-life protections across the coun-
try. 
Time and time again, I have come to 
this floor to oppose Democrats’ radical 
antilife agenda. 
As many times as it takes, I will 
stand here to reject the attacks on life, 
and I will vote ‘‘no’’ on taxpayer-fund-
ed services, including the wicked pro-
posal to permit abortion on demand at 
any time bankrolled by the American 
people. 
These are dark days in this country. 
At the same time we have so much to 
be happy and hopeful for as we look at 
this new year. 
The Supreme Court, including my 
fellow Hoosier, Justice Amy Coney 
Barrett, is currently considering the 
most significant challenge to Roe v. 
Wade since 1973. 
This could be the final anniversary 
that we mark under Roe v. Wade. 
For five decades, we have been in a 
long battle against abortion, and this 
is the time to restore the dignity of life 
and protect life once and for all. 
As a pro-life lawmaker, I am proud to 
stand alongside millions of Americans 
in Indiana and across the country who 
believe in the inherent value of life. 
Our enduring commitment to life and 
the truth will prevail. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, the gentlewoman is right, the 
sanctity of human life is one of the 
central principles that this country is 
founded upon, and it does get darkest 
before the dawn. There is hope on the 
horizon. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. VAN 
DREW). 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
thank him for his leadership. 
The President’s most important job 
is to lead, to lead and protect our coun-
try. Yet time and again, all we have 
seen from President Biden is a failure 
to lead. 
Biden’s handling of Afghanistan led 
to the death of 13 American service-
members and left hundreds more aban-
doned. This was a failure to lead. 
Biden’s handling of the border has 
been a disaster with more than two 
million illegal immigrants being appre-
hended at our border. This was a fail-
ure to lead. 
b 1415 
Biden failed to shut down COVID–19 
and has allowed more Americans to die 
from this disease, despite widespread 
access to vaccines. This was a failure 
to lead. 
Inflation is at a 40-year high; supply 
chains are crippled; and labor short-
ages have hindered an economic recov-
ery. This has been a failure to lead. 
Soft-on-crime policy has resulted in 
16 of America’s largest cities suffering 
from new highs in homicide rates and a 
115 percent increase in attacks against 
our law enforcement officials, all while 
President Biden and House Democrats 
demand to defund our police. This has 
been a failure to lead. 
This is not the America I know. The 
America I know is strong, and it de-
serves a strong leader, not the worst 
President in our history, not one that 
continues time and again to fail to 
lead. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Those 
are not just Republican talking points. 
Politico had a story this morning. 
They asked Americans in a nationwide 
poll to give the President a letter 
grade, and 37 percent of Americans 
gave him an F—85 percent or more of 
Republicans, but also, they say, an 
alarming number of Democrats gave a 
D or an F grade. 
So the gentleman is exactly right. It 
is a failure. An F-minus, says Mr. VAN 
DREW. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my good 
friend from the State of Tennessee (Mr. 
BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman. It is the great 
State of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, for the last year, 
Joe Biden and the Democrats have 
completely controlled our government 
in Washington. Their first order of 
business when they took power was to 
ram through Congress almost $2 tril-
lion in Federal spending under the so- 
called American Rescue Plan. 
When this bill became law last 
March, Democrats said it was nec-
essary to fight the coronavirus. Ten 
months later, our country is still deal-
ing with the same problems Democrats 
claimed their bill would solve. 
COVID tests are sold out at drug-
stores, 
and 
testing 
centers

hourlong lines. Not even KAMALA HAR-
RIS can give a straight answer about 
when Americans will receive at-home 
test kits. Is it this week? Is it next 
week? Is it sometime in the future? I 
don’t think she knows. 
We have overwhelmed hospitals that 
are struggling to treat patients due to 
staffing shortages. Corrupt teachers’ 
unions are forcing students out of the 
classroom and bullying parents. Busi-
nesses of all sizes and across industries 
cannot find enough workers to keep up 
with the demand. 
Madam Speaker, the American Res-
cue Plan failed miserably to address or 
prevent these issues. That is because it 
mostly focused on funding liberal spe-
cial interests instead of targeted pan-
demic relief. 
This whole debacle confirmed two 
things: Congress cannot spend its way 
out of a problem, and Democrats will 
always use a crisis to advance their po-
litical agenda. 
Joe Biden promised to shut down the 
coronavirus when he took office. One 
year later, all he shut down were 
America’s hospitals and businesses. 
Thank you, Vice Chairman JOHNSON, 
for your adequate and more-than-lack-
luster leadership skills. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
keeping me humble. 
Madam Speaker, we have just come 
straight to the floor from a Members 
and media roundtable on the border 
and crime crises, and he led that so 
ably. I am delighted to hear what he 
has to say in his 2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, it is hard to pick 
the crisis to talk about because there 
are so many. I would like to talk about 
unity. 
I was at the inauguration last year. I 
heard the President’s speech. I heard 
him campaign. His message was cen-
tered on restoring unity to an angry 
Nation. He promised to bring us to-
gether. 
Well, he has brought the American 
people together, that is for sure, be-
cause everyone now understands the 
full magnitude of the crises that we are 
going through. He has united the coun-
try in that fact alone. 
One year ago, I want everyone to re-
member, we were not experiencing the 
inflation that we are, the highest rate 
in 40 years. We did not have foreign ad-
versaries who were treading over our 
policies and looking at us as weak. 
Right now, we have a border that is 
in complete chaos and complete crisis. 
It has only been 1 year under President 
Biden’s reign, and our Nation is direc-
tionless from the masthead in the 
midst of chaos, not to mention that 
our international reputation and our 
influence 
have 
been 
squandered 
through policy failure after policy fail-
ure. 
When you look at this poster right 
here, look at the energy crisis that we 
are dealing with, and Ukraine right 
now is in the midst of not knowing 
whether or not they are going to be in-
vaded by the Russians. What a terrible 
position to be in. 
The President has green-lighted Nord 
Stream. He failed to sanction the Nord 
Stream pipeline. The energy crisis that 
is going on in Eastern Europe right 
now, the fact that we are not strong 
around the world in our messaging to 
deter our enemies and to help our al-
lies, is directly leading to this issue 
that we see in Ukraine right now. And 
do you know who is watching? China. 
China is watching this, and they are 
wondering whether or not Taiwan is 
going to be next. 
We have to get back to a strong, firm 
understanding of law and order, the 
same discussion that we just had on 
the border crisis. We have to reassert 
our leadership to make sure that our 
country, the greatest Nation that this 
world has ever known, will choose to 
follow law and order. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for that 
keen insight that he gained faithfully 
serving our country in the military. I 
thank him for his service. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER), 
another gentleman who has served us 
so well on the front lines of law en-
forcement before he got to Congress. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
could speak for hours about this ad-
ministration’s multiple failures over 
the last year, but I only have a couple 
of minutes, so I will cover just infla-
tion, one of them. 
Since Joe Biden took office, inflation 
has risen every single month. Ameri-
cans are paying more for just about ev-
erything while earning less in every 
paycheck. 
This is not sustainable, and it didn’t 
have to be this way. This administra-
tion is so out of touch with the average 
American that despite inflation reach-
ing a 40-year high, they are still push-
ing for more reckless spending that 
will only make this crisis worse. 
American families are paying sub-
stantially more for everyday products, 
from gasoline to groceries and to en-
ergy for heating their homes this win-
ter, to heat their homes in northern 
Minnesota when it is 30-below for a 
week straight. 
Make no mistake, inflation is a tax 
on us all, especially our working class 
and those on fixed incomes. It is no se-
cret that we live in a very polarized na-
tion right now, but there is one thing a 
strong majority of Americans agree on: 
Joe Biden’s first year in office has been 
disastrous to the American people. We 
deserve better. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. OWENS). 
Mr. 
OWENS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my good friend from Louisiana 
for his great leadership. 
Madam Speaker, over the past year, I 
spent time throughout Utah’s Fourth 
District. I have heard from Utahns 
from all walks of life, and month after 
month, they have shared the same con-
cerns: soaring inflation, skyrocketing 
prices, and decreasing wages. 
That is no surprise because gas is up 
49.6 percent. Used cars are up 37.3 per-
cent. Gas utilities are up 24.1 percent. 
Meat, fish, and eggs are up 12.5 percent. 
Electricity is up 6.3 percent. 
On top of this, as real wages have de-
creased 8 out of the last 11 months, our 
economy is still missing millions of 
prepandemic jobs, and employers are 
continuing to struggle with persistent 
labor shortages. 
What is this administration doing to 
help? You can’t make this up: dis-
missing inflation as high-class prob-
lems and transitory; adding to the na-
tional debt with money we don’t have 
on programs we don’t need; and, just 
last week, advocating to nuke a fili-
buster the President defended for dec-
ades to push through a radical Federal 
takeover of all elections. 
Our economy should be thriving right 
now, but inaction, on purpose, by this 
administration has massively increased 
our national debt, which still sits at 
$29 trillion, by the way; stifled growth; 
and financially crippled American fam-
ilies and small businesses. 
We are closing out the first year of 
Biden’s Presidency with the worst in-
flation of 40 years; open borders; 
emboldened 
adversaries; 
a 
botched 
withdrawal from Afghanistan; and a re-
peated push to increase the size, scope, 
and reach of the Federal Government. 
This year, I encourage President 
Biden to start paying attention to the 
real needs of real Americans. Maybe 
then we will start seeing real results. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. So well 
said, as always. I think one of the key 
words you said was purposeful. These 
crises are not happenstance. These are 
direct results of policy choices. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN), my good friend. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, so 
many areas to pick from in which we 
talk about the first year of this admin-
istration. 
No country can exist if you don’t 
have immigration laws, and I can’t 
think of anywhere where the new ad-
ministration is more of a change from 
the old. 
We have gone through a situation in 
which about 25,000 people every year 
crossed our southern border, and now 
routinely 
over 
75,000, 
tripling 
the 
amount of people who have come 
across our border. 
That has received a lot of attention, 
but not enough attention has been re-
ceived for the lack of people being 
pushed back across the border if they 
are caught here breaking crimes or 
otherwise. 
In the first 6 months of 2020, about 
93,000 people were kicked out. This

time around, it is about 18,000. So we 
have about another 70,000 people who 
we don’t want in this country, pri-
marily because they have broken the 
law. Under the Biden administration, 
we don’t kick them out. 
We have to also look at the carrot 
that they are giving people to come 
here in the Build Back Better bill, try-
ing to give free college education to 
people who come here illegally. Every 
Democrat but one in this body voted 
for it, saying: Yes, absolutely. We not 
only want people to come here ille-
gally, but we will give them free col-
lege education, free medical care. 
Unbelievable. 
Showing that the number one pri-
ority is to get people here illegally, 
they are not even giving tests for 
COVID, which says something or other. 
I mean, on the one hand, it is impor-
tant that everybody even get a shot if 
they are hanging around Washington, 
D.C., but if you are coming across the 
southern border, we don’t care. Unbe-
lievable. 
Quite a change in America compared 
to what it used to be, and it is going to 
take a lot of work when we get a new 
President to undo the huge amount of 
damage that has been done to the fab-
ric of this country in the first 12 
months of Joe Biden. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. It is so 
well 
said. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
they 
are 
incentivizing lawlessness. That is ex-
actly what we are seeing, and every-
body knows it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA), 
my friend. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, Mr. JOHNSON. I ap-
preciate this Special Order. 
Of course, this week does mark the 
first year of the Biden administration. 
Unfortunately, it was one of unprece-
dented crisis. Indeed, it is a target-rich 
environment for us to talk about here 
tonight. 
Democrats have controlled the exec-
utive branch and both Chambers of 
Congress, allowing them to pass, so far, 
$2 trillion out of their $9 trillion plans. 
This act has also caused the highest in-
flation in decades, hitting the middle- 
class and lower income class hardest in 
this country. 
This year, under Democrat leader-
ship, Americans are paying more for 
just about everything, from housing, 
clothes, food, and gas—especially in en-
ergy. On the way to the airport in Cali-
fornia, it was $5-plus, $5.39 at one place. 
Incredible. 
In the dead of winter, people are see-
ing the cost of heating their homes 
skyrocket. When you stop all sorts of 
development of energy in this country, 
you are not going to have the supply. 
That sends a signal to the whole mar-
ket to raise prices, including the Biden 
administration telling OPEC overseas 
to go ahead and send us more while 
cutting off our own pipelines and fur-
ther development on Federal lands. 
This, of course, ripples through every-
thing else in costs. 
In my real life as a farmer, we are 
going to see our costs of energy— 
whether it is diesel fuel, gasoline, fer-
tilizer—skyrocket. That is either going 
to have to be passed along to the con-
sumer at the store or farmers go broke 
in this country. Small business owners 
face the same thing. 
Everything is going up—more in 
costs, vaccine mandates, less employ-
ees. I mean, I wish we could paint a 
brighter picture and not have it appear 
to be a partisan one. It really isn’t par-
tisan. It is about having success as a 
country. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion doesn’t seem to have a clue what 
that success would look like. Indeed, 
they are chasing their own mandates, 
putting us in a terrible position as a 
people and for the economy going for-
ward. They need to change their think-
ing, or the voters need to change them 
out. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. It is not 
partisanship. We are sharing the facts. 
He is exactly right. 
I would encourage my colleagues— 
there are so many who want to speak, 
and it is a target-rich environment 
with so many crises. We are going to 
try to stick to 2 minutes on these 
yields. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Missouri 
(Mrs. 
HARTZLER). 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, tomorrow will mark 
1 year since President Biden’s inau-
guration, and Americans are left ask-
ing: Are we better off under this ad-
ministration? 
Judging by his all-time low approval 
ratings, the answer for Americans is a 
resounding no. Everywhere you look, 
there is a crisis riddled with incom-
petence, division, and dysfunction. 
At our southern border, Biden has al-
lowed nearly 2 million illegal immi-
grants to enter our Nation, creating 
the worst border crisis in 30 years. 
In the classroom, Biden has targeted 
parents and their role in education. His 
administration even lobbied for them 
to be called domestic terrorists. 
b 1430 
Madam Speaker, in our communities 
violent crime is at all-time highs. Last 
year, the murder rate was higher than 
at any point since 1996. 
On the economy, Biden’s mishandling 
of our Federal Government has created 
the highest inflation rate in 40 years. 
Bare shelves, high gas prices, and sup-
ply chain issues continue to dog this 
administration. 
On the world stage, Biden botched 
our withdrawal from Afghanistan, sur-
rendering to the Taliban and making 
America a laughingstock to our adver-
saries. All of this resulted in the deaths 
of 13 servicemembers, including one 
from my home State of Missouri. 
Instead of addressing these issues, 
President Biden had doubled down on 
his far-left socialist policies, out-of- 
control spending, and incompetence. It 
is past time for a change. America de-
serves better. They need leadership 
that listens and fights for hardworking 
families, not against them. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to help 
lead the fight alongside my fellow Re-
publicans 
to 
reverse 
course 
by 
unleashing our economy, securing our 
border, respecting parents, defending 
life and our foundational values, and 
providing for the common defense. 
On this one-year anniversary com-
memorating the misery of the Biden 
administration, we commit ourselves 
to never stop fighting for what is right, 
to work harder than ever, and to never 
give up. America is depending on us. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE), home of the new 
national championship football team. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, tomor-
row marks the one-year anniversary of 
President Biden’s inauguration. Many 
Americans have now endured 365 days 
of an absent administration, 52 weeks 
of policy failures, 12 months of utter 
turmoil, and a year of constant, crip-
pling crises. 
Earlier today a Rasmussen Poll re-
vealed that 60 percent of the country 
considers the President’s first year in 
office unsuccessful. Fifty percent said 
it was very unsuccessful, with one 
third of Democrats believing Biden’s 
first year was a failure. All of this has 
contributed to his abysmal 33 percent 
rating, the lowest since Jimmy Carter. 
Madam Speaker, in all sincerity, I 
didn’t imagine this much damage could 
be done in just one year, but here we 
are, facing an economic crisis with 
hyperinflation, a supply chain crisis, a 
labor shortage crisis, a border crisis, a 
national security crisis, an energy cri-
sis with incredible gas prices, an edu-
cation crisis, a COVID crisis, a crime 
crisis, and an election integrity crisis 
with Democrats trying to push through 
election reforms that would federalize 
our election and eliminate voter ID. 
Ultimately, these all stem from a lead-
ership crisis in the White House, a 
leadership crisis that has caused Amer-
icans unnecessary hardship. 
Madam Speaker, as we enter the sec-
ond year of the Biden administration’s 
rule, the President has an important 
decision to make. Will he continue to 
sidestep from the crises he has created, 
destined to inflict more destruction? 
Or will he confront these crises head-on 
and implement successful solutions? 
Mr. President, the American people 
demand successful solutions. They de-
serve successful solutions. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, Presi-
dent Biden ran his campaign on a mes-
sage of unity. Since day one of his ad-
ministration, he has been defined by 
the divisive policies that are the wrong

approach for Tennessee families and 
workers. 
In 2021, we saw cartels take control 
of our southern border. We saw the 
worst inflation in decades. We saw Af-
ghanistan fall into the hands of terror-
ists as we hastily and incompetently 
withdrew our forces from the country, 
leaving billions of dollars of modern 
military equipment and hundreds of 
Americans and Afghan allies behind. 
Finally, we saw abusive government 
overreach in the form of vaccine man-
dates taken to new heights. 
With President Biden in the White 
House and Democrats in control of 
Congress, Americans know 2022 will be 
no 
better. 
According 
to 
a 
recent 
Momentive Poll, more than half of 
Americans are more fearful than hope-
ful about what 2022 has in store for 
them and with good reason. 
Just take a glimpse at the state of 
our economy. The Consumer Price 
Index rose 7 percent in December, the 
highest rate seen since 1982. This comes 
on the heels of President Biden’s reck-
less spending agenda and senseless poli-
cies that have created a labor shortage; 
led to a decline in real, personal in-
come; raised costs of consumer goods, 
gas, and home heating costs; and con-
tributed to the supply chain disrup-
tions that are causing drastic short-
ages and bare shelves across America. 
Madam Speaker, this is President 
Joe Biden’s version of America. It is 
costing Tennesseans more each day. 
President Biden can try to talk around 
it. He often refuses to talk about it at 
all. The reality remains the same. His 
administration’s policies have been 
devastating to this Nation. More than 
ever, Americans want America-first 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, as we begin the first 
days of 2022, I remain steadfast in my 
commitment to focus on the needs of 
the good folks of Tennessee who I rep-
resent, not the whims of the permanent 
class of political elites in Washington 
D.C. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD), another seasoned, very effec-
tive legislator. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
this has been a year of crisis under the 
leadership of President Joe Biden. At 
the southern border, our country was 
noticeably lacking leadership and solu-
tions from the White House. Instead, 
President Biden took regressive ac-
tions. He halted construction on the 
border wall, brought back catch and re-
lease, and got rid of the remain in Mex-
ico policy. 
Because of these decisions, over 1.7 
million illegal immigrants have been 
encountered at the southern border 
since President Biden took office. The 
number of illegal crossings at the bor-
der has risen at a rate faster under 
President Biden than at any other time 
in recent history. U.S. Customs and 
Border 
Protection 
reported 
that 
fentanyl seizures increased 134 percent 
in fiscal year 2021. 
I saw this crisis firsthand when I vis-
ited the southern border with my col-
leagues, and I have led and supported 
legislative solutions in Congress to 
combat this crisis. It is disheartening 
and unacceptable that President Biden 
has neither visited the border to wit-
ness the crisis, nor has he proposed so-
lutions to control the unmanageable 
levels of border crossings and fentanyl 
trafficking. To say President Biden has 
under-delivered to the American people 
is beyond an understatement. 
Madam Speaker, I say it again. This 
year has been a year of crisis under the 
leadership of President Biden. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ), 
who we refer to as ‘‘The Chief.’’ 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, life 
has been hard for the American people 
as President Biden concludes his first 
year in office. Unfortunately, too many 
in this Chamber have bowed down to 
the most radical fringes of the Demo-
cratic Party. 
The sad reality today is liberals in 
Congress have no clue what every day, 
hardworking 
Americans 
are 
going 
through. They care more about pushing 
their 
radical 
agenda 
than 
helping 
working families. The result is more 
inflation, higher gas prices, unconsti-
tutional vaccine mandates, broken sup-
ply chains, and Americans struggling 
to make ends meet. 
On our side of the aisle, Republicans 
are committed to making sure we get 
the American people back to work, en-
suring that small businesses can find 
employees to help keep their busi-
nesses open, making sure Americans 
have uninterrupted access to goods, 
and getting our country roaring back 
with a strong economy and safe com-
munities. Those are the issues that 
Americans really care about. 
Here in Washington, Republicans will 
use our congressional authority to hold 
the Biden administration accountable 
for the Afghanistan debacle where we 
don’t know how many Americans are 
still left behind in Afghanistan, for 
choosing to wreck our energy sector, 
handing Putin the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line, and for allowing the southern bor-
ders to be kept wide open. Where once 
we were energy independent a year ago, 
now we are begging OPEC to please 
produce more. 
Madam Speaker, after only a year of 
the Biden administration and his rad-
ical governing of our country, we have 
had enough. The American people have 
had enough. Our people, our country 
deserve better. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, 
several days ago the Department of 
Labor released statistics on job cre-
ation and inflation in the United 
States. This data should be deeply 
alarming to every American. 
This country, over the last year, has 
dumped trillions of dollars of excess 
Federal spending into our economy. At 
the time economists warned us that 
doing so was dangerously inflationary. 
Unfortunately, those fears have come 
to fruition. 
The statistics for the month of De-
cember show inflation at nearly 7 per-
cent on an annualized basis. That is 
the highest rate of inflation in nearly 
40 years. When inflation is caused 
through government action, as this 
round of inflation clearly is, it rep-
resents an unseen tax that is paid by 
every American because it raises the 
prices of everything that we buy. 
Equally alarming is the fact that real 
wage growth has not kept up with in-
flation. In fact, the Department of 
Labor says that for all of last year real 
wage growth was negative nearly 21⁄2 
percent. If we don’t correct this trend, 
it is going to result in an entire gen-
eration of Americans being driven to-
ward poverty because their wages are 
not keeping up with the prices that 
they pay for the goods that they need 
to survive. 
Madam Speaker, we need to get our 
fiscal house in order and correct this 
runaway Federal spending before our 
children suffer the consequences. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Mrs. 
STEEL). 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, this 
administration’s failed policies have 
led to record inflation and empty store 
shelves across the country. Inflation 
just reached the highest level in 40 
years. At the same time basic goods 
are harder and harder to find at the 
stores thanks to the supply chain mess. 
Every day we see a new story about 
things getting more expensive, life get-
ting 
harder 
for 
Americans. 
Hard-
working families are sick and tired of 
paying more and getting less. 
Madam Speaker, I have produced 
three bills that would help fix the sup-
ply chain crisis and ensure goods make 
it to the stores and consumers. These 
issues are urgent, but there has been no 
movement on these bills. Meanwhile, 
Democrats in Washington continue to 
spend more as paychecks get smaller 
and costs continue to rise. 
Madam Speaker, I will continue to 
fight against these bad policies and 
push for solutions. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, as 
America marks a year since President 
Biden’s inauguration, Republicans are 
focused on delivering solutions to the 
multitude of crises his administration 
has created. 
After a year of one-party rule, the re-
ality is American families are seeing 
empty shelves at the grocery store. 
Businesses cannot find workers. Infla-
tion just hit the highest rate in 40 
years. Meanwhile, the catastrophe at 
our southern border continues to wors-
en. In the past 12 months, more than

January 19, 2022 
1.7 million people have been caught 
trying to enter the United States ille-
gally. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration can ignore these inconvenient 
truths all they want. Do you know who 
is noticing? The American people are 
noticing. These are the same people 
who are working every day, the people 
driving our economy forward in spite of 
President Biden stacking the odds 
against them. 
Madam Speaker, be assured when Re-
publicans regain the majority in the 
House, we will continue tackling these 
challenges by getting government out 
of the way, restoring our God-given 
freedoms, and ensuring Americans keep 
more of their hard-earned money. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), 
one of the true border states that sees 
all of these crises firsthand. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, well, 
it has been one year since President 
Biden and the Democrats have had 
complete control of running our coun-
try. 
b 1445 
They have the House, the Senate, and 
the Presidency. 
And what have they accomplished in 
this 1 year? 
Inflation has gone through the roof— 
a 40-year high. Gas prices are up. Gro-
cery prices are up. The utilities costs 
have gone up. The border is wide-open 
with 
sex 
trafficking, 
human 
traf-
ficking, and fentanyl flooding across 
our border. 
COVID deaths are higher than they 
have ever been before. 
Madam Speaker, do you know those 
long lines that you see of Americans 
waiting in line for COVID tests? 
Well, guess what, Madam Speaker? 
The Biden administration diverted 
over $2 billion that was meant for 
those testing of COVID and for medical 
supplies and diverted it to house illegal 
immigrants. 
Don’t be surprised or mistaken, but 
it is the Democrat policies that have 
caused these problems. 
And what are the Democrats doing 
now while the country is going down 
the tubes? 
They are pushing election laws, elec-
tion laws where they want to rig elec-
tions to their favor and fund their own 
elections. This is insanity. 
I hope my Democratic colleagues will 
work together with us to solve the 
problems that are facing Americans 
today. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for her so 
well-said remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas, (Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentleman from Lou-
isiana for hosting this today. There are 
a lot of things to talk about for a year. 
We could talk about immigration. We 
could talk about inflation. We could 
talk about crime. And we could talk 
about Afghanistan. The list goes on 
and on. 
But I want to talk for a little bit 
today about trade and specifically our 
relationship with China. 
I rise today to call the Biden admin-
istration to action regarding our trade 
partnership, 
or 
lack 
thereof, 
with 
China. 
China has proven to be a bad faith 
negotiator, and they are using the 
United States as a doormat. Our coun-
try made a deal with China 2 years ago 
on January 15, 2020, and China has 
failed to live up to their end of the bar-
gain by a long shot. As part of this 
deal, China committed to importing $36 
billion of U.S. agriculture products in 
2020 and 2021 combined, but they have 
fallen short by nearly $7 billion. China 
sold American farmers a bill of goods, 
and the Biden administration has made 
no effort to rectify this egregious situ-
ation. 
Now that phase one is expiring, farm-
ers and ranchers are frustrated to say 
the 
least. 
USDA 
Secretary 
Tom 
Vilsack, in a feeble effort to reassure 
us, said: 
Ambassador Tai, our U.S. Trade Represent-
ative, continues to converse with China 
about the necessity of living up totally and 
completely to the phase one trade agree-
ment, making up their deficit over the 
course of the next several years. 
This is completely unacceptable. The 
next several years was never part of 
this deal, which is not a complex one. 
China said that they would purchase a 
certain amount of agricultural goods, 
and they have fallen short by a margin 
that suggests that they never intended 
to live up to their end of the deal in the 
first place. 
Again, we have not seen any effort 
from this administration on behalf of 
farmers, which is why I am standing 
here today to state the obvious—the 
United States must either force China 
to comply with their end of the agree-
ment or punish them for failing to do 
so. That is how deals work. At the very 
least, we need to see this administra-
tion developing a new, comprehensive, 
realistic deal to collect the deficit. The 
time for conversations already took 
place long before the deal was signed 
January 15, 2020, when China signed the 
deal. 
This administration at year end 
needs to step up and defend our farm-
ers, our ranchers, and our country from 
being 
financially 
manipulated 
by 
China—yet another unnecessary crisis. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
that plain talk from Kansas. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), who 
is one of the brightest and most re-
spected Members of Congress. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, if the 
Biden administration were a new TV 
show streaming on Netflix or HBO, it 
clearly would have been canceled after 
the end of the first season. 
On this anniversary of Mr. Biden’s 
failed first year, I call attention to the 
crisis at the Southwest border, a crisis 
which President Biden and the Demo-
crats have continuously chosen to turn 
a blind eye to. In just 1 year, over 1.7 
million illegal immigrants have been 
apprehended at the border—an all-time 
high. 
President Trump spent 4 years fight-
ing to secure our border by enacting 
policies to keep Americans—especially 
in our communities along the border— 
safe. After less than a month in office, 
President Biden revoked the Trump-era 
border policies and replaced them, 
Madam Speaker, with what? 
Absolutely nothing. 
In April, 3 months after Joe Biden 
took office and 2 months after these 
policies were rescinded, I made my sev-
enth trip to the Southwest border. Dur-
ing that visit, I witnessed the most un-
stable conditions that I have seen since 
coming to Congress. I immediately 
called on President Biden then to rein-
state the Trump-era policies that were 
working along our border. 
Finally, just a few weeks ago in De-
cember, it was announced that Presi-
dent Biden planned to re-implement 
President Trump’s Remain in Mexico 
policy. But, Madam Speaker, we need 
action, 
not 
talk. 
President 
Biden 
should visit the border and talk to the 
communities there. President Biden 
should fire his Homeland Security Sec-
retary who is not getting the job done. 
So in this first failed year, President 
Biden has neglected our Southwest bor-
der. That neglect is evident with dete-
riorating conditions, apprehensions at 
an all-time high, and record amounts 
of illegal drugs pouring across our open 
border and poisoning our families. 
Americans deserve better. Americans 
deserve a secure border, and Americans 
deserve leadership. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, Americans do deserve so 
much better. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. JOHNSON
for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, 1 year ago, I joined 
several of my colleagues—especially 
the freshman Republican colleagues— 
in a letter to President Biden showing 
our willingness to work with him on 
behalf of the American people and to 
bridge the partisan gridlock, because 
our President’s success is our Nation’s 
success. 
While I am proud that 1 year later I 
have been able to get 12 bipartisan bills 
out of the House and four signed into 
law, I am disappointed that the policies 
from the Biden administration encour-
age more division, more Federal spend-
ing, and more crises hurting American 
workers, families, and small businesses 
as we continue through the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Inflation is at a 40-year high, driving 
up prices everywhere from the grocery 
store to prices at the gas pump. We 
have record high numbers of migrants 
and illicit drugs at our southern border

straining our resources and empow-
ering drug cartels. Our disastrous with-
drawal from Afghanistan resulted in 
the deaths of 13 U.S. servicemembers, 
and we still have left the lives of Amer-
icans and our allies and military arse-
nal in the hands of the Taliban. 
In the latest edition of partisan poli-
tics last week, one of my bipartisan 
bills was taken over and instead be-
came over 700 pages of nationalizing 
elections and letting public funds be 
used for political campaigns. 
I will keep working through this 
gridlock, sticking to my conservative 
policies and principles and fighting 
back against Big Government and big 
spending policies. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank 
the gentlewoman for her principled 
leadership. It has been effective, and 
we are grateful she is here. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the State of Texas (Mr. 
WEBER). 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, tomorrow, January 20, 2022, is a day 
that will live in infamy and marks 1 
year since Joe Biden was sworn in as 
President. 
I remember saying: This is the most 
important election of our lifetime. 
Unfortunately, I was right. 
In 1 year—under one-party rule and 
in just 1 year—it has been one huge, 
continuing debacle and crisis. 
We went from energy independence 
to energy crisis, Madam Speaker; from 
a rebounding economy to the highest 
inflation in 40 years; from inter-
national peace through strength to in-
creased tensions with our greatest ad-
versaries; and might I add, losing the 
confidence of our allies. 
We went, Madam Speaker, from bor-
der security to 2 million illegal alien 
crossings; from the end of the pan-
demic to the never-ending pandemic, 
particularly 
with 
unconstitutional 
mandates. 
What is the cause? 
One Democrat disaster after another, 
and Americans are losing faith not 
only with the performance of the cur-
rent administration, but also with our 
governmental agencies: the FBI, the 
DOJ, and the CDC. You name it. The 
list is endless. 
Democrats are showing who they are: 
Socialists, police defunders, open bor-
der advocates, and anti-parents who 
just want a say in their child’s school-
ing. Is that too much to ask? 
That is what Democrats are. This is 
their brand, and that Democrat brand, 
I might add, is a disaster. We Repub-
licans need to point it out every day in 
every way. 
So to my Republican colleagues I 
say, let’s go brand ‘em. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Brand 
‘em. I like it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER), 
who is another very effective legis-
lator. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the Congressman for 
hosting this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, Americans have ex-
perienced whiplash this past year as 
the Biden administration has spun us 
from the America first agenda to 
America last. 
We watched in horror as the Taliban 
released thousands of al-Qaida, ISIS, 
and Taliban prisoners from the prison 
at Bagram Air Base. Our servicemem-
bers bravely sacrificed to capture those 
terrorists, and the Biden administra-
tion allowed them to be released. One 
of the ISIS-K prisoners led the bombing 
that killed our 13 servicemembers. 
Biden’s failure in Afghanistan led to 
the surrender of tens of billions of dol-
lars in U.S. military equipment to the 
Taliban. Military equipment paid for 
by U.S. taxpayers will now be used 
against America because of President 
Biden. As Afghanistan fell, President 
Biden disappeared, first to Camp David 
and then to Delaware. 
His Cabinet refused to brief the 
American people directly and instead 
sent spokesmen. Additionally, the De-
fense Secretary refused to testify be-
fore Congress. 
The Biden administration then flew 
an estimated 78,000 Afghan nationals to 
American soil and then lied to the 
American people about the vetting 
process they were using to ensure that 
no ISIS, al-Qaida, or Taliban terrorists 
were brought to our shores. 
To this day, no one in the Biden ad-
ministration has been held responsible 
for the disastrous withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan or for the lies that were told 
to the American people, and no one has 
been fired or resigned. 
Madam Speaker, who will be fired? 
Who is resigning? 
The American people deserve ac-
countability. China, our enemy, has 
watched all of this unfold; and, sadly, 
our children and grandchildren will pay 
the price of Biden’s incompetence. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, the gentlewoman’s remarks 
are well-said. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Georgia 
(Mr. CARTER). Georgia is the home of 
the new national championship foot-
ball team. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for hosting this Special 
Order. 
Madam Speaker, Joe Biden’s first 
year in office has exceeded all expecta-
tions. In 365 short days, Joe Biden has 
managed to inflict an entire term of 
pain and hardship on the American 
people. 
Grocery 
store 
shelves 
are 
empty. Prices are up 7 percent nation-
wide. Gas costs $1 more per gallon 
today than it did when Biden took of-
fice. Americans lost the equivalent of 
two paychecks last year, and Biden has 
failed to add one single job from our 
2019 high. 
Madam Speaker, only one thing has 
gone down in price during this adminis-
tration, and that is the price of 
fentanyl. That is the price of fentanyl 
because of the fentanyl that is coming 
across the southern border. 
Washington Democrats were count-
ing on Joe Biden to socialize our econ-
omy, and, boy, did he deliver. His ad-
ministration caved to teachers unions, 
putting the wants of liberal elites 
ahead of the needs of our children who 
are desperate for high quality, in-per-
son learning. 
Domestic terrorists—that is how this 
administration labeled parents who 
want better for their children than vir-
tual learning. It is despicable. 
He caved to Russia, gutting the Key-
stone XL pipeline on his first day in of-
fice but allowing the Nord Stream 2 
pipeline to push ahead virtually un-
checked. 
He caved to Fauci, who kept his job 
despite lying to Congress about gain- 
of-function research. 
Do you know who isn’t caving, 
Madam Speaker? 
Senator 
MANCHIN, 
the 
Supreme 
Court, and Republicans across the Na-
tion who are fed up with this adminis-
tration’s singular focus on stripping 
rights and opportunities away from 
Americans. This administration has 
more than earned its 33 percent ap-
proval rating, and I hope, for the sake 
of our country, that the next 3 years 
are nothing like the one we have just 
endured.

Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I am happy to yield to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
SPARTZ), one of the smartest and hard-
est working Members of Congress. 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for yielding. I 
know that we have talked a lot about 
different crises, and we do have a lot of 
different crises. We have an economic 
crisis. We have an inflation crisis. We 
have an energy cost crisis. We have a 
supply chain crisis. We have an edu-
cation crisis. We have a crime crisis. 
We have a COVID response crisis. We 
have a healthcare crisis. We have a for-
eign relations and security crisis. We 
have a freedom of speech crisis. We 
have a centralized government and in-
fringement on our rights crisis. 
There is one crisis that is very dis-
turbing and concerning to me as a nat-
uralized American who immigrated to 
this great country. I went to the border 
three times, and what I saw was law-
lessness; its issue of national security, 
its anarchy, and it is a crisis that has 
posed a risk to our sovereignty as a na-
tion. 
We can see what has happened in the 
country. Drug cartels are controlling 
the border. They control drug traf-
ficking and are making billions from 
that. We have the highest deaths from 
overdoses in our country that ever ex-
isted. Our kids are dying, and they are 
making a lot of money. The border is 
open. No one can control it. It poses 
risks to our national security. 
I hope for us all as Americans who 
care about our country, that our Presi-
dent at least starts dealing with this 
crisis because it is a serious issue, and

we cannot disregard national security 
of the greatest country that ever ex-
isted on Earth and put our people at 
risk. 
It is our responsibility as Represent-
atives for this Republic to stand up, re-
gardless of party affiliations, and raise 
the issues, and we owe a duty to the 
American people. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her comments. 
Madam Speaker, what my colleagues 
have illustrated here in this Special 
Order is the crisis that we have in this 
country. We are on the anniversary 
now of 1 year of far-left Democratic 
rule in Washington. We have a unified 
government. The far-left Democrats 
are in charge of the White House and 
both Houses of Congress. Elections 
have consequences. The American peo-
ple can see it for themselves. Every 
poll across this country shows us. They 
know that it is crisis upon crisis upon 
crisis. 
You have heard my colleagues illus-
trate so many of those here this after-
noon. If we had hours upon hours we 
could continue all night. 
The economic crisis last year: Infla-
tion cost the average worker nearly 
two paychecks. 
An energy crisis: The national aver-
age for a gallon of gas rose 49.6 percent 
for the year. 
A border crisis: Because of the Demo-
crats’ open border policies, every State 
is now a border State. 
An education crisis: President Biden 
promised to reopen schools in his first 
100 days but his administration se-
cretly worked with teachers’ unions to 
keep the schools closed and label par-
ents as domestic terrorists. 
A crime crisis: Over a dozen U.S. cit-
ies had a record-high homicide rate in 
2021. 
A COVID crisis: Although President 
Biden promised to shut down the virus, 
many Americans continue to struggle 
to find tests, and, of course, many 
schools remain closed because of this. 
A national security crisis: Because of 
President Biden’s weakness on the 
world stage, our adversaries in Beijing, 
Tehran, and Moscow are stronger today 
and they are in power. 
We could go on and on and on. I am 
out of time, Madam Speaker, but I will 
just point out again, the latest poll 
that was released just this morning 
didn’t look at just numbers. They 
asked the American people to give a 
letter grade to the President. Thirty 
percent of Americans give the Presi-
dent an F, a failing grade, and more 
Americans give him an F than give him 
an A or a B. This is a failed Presidency. 
These are failed policies. We are living 
under the crises that they have cre-
ated. It is time for this to come to an 
end. 
We are grateful to the American peo-
ple for recognizing this, and we look 
forward to bringing our solutions to 
bear at the election cycle this fall. 
Madam Speaker, our Special Order 
hour has concluded, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

MOURNING THE LIVES LOST AT 
TWIN PARKS NORTH WEST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TORRES) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I come here with the heaviest 
heart. My beloved Bronx saw the dead-
liest fire in the history of New York 
City in more than three decades; a fire 
that has left a death count of 17 resi-
dents, including 8 children. 
A malfunctioning space heater was 
the immediate cause of the fire in a du-
plex on the third floor of a 19-story 
building known as Twin Parks North 
West. And even though the fire was 
largely limited to the third floor, both 
the apartment door and the nearby 
stairwell door were left open, causing 
the smoke to spread rapidly and widely 
throughout the 19-story building. 
Since the building has no fire escapes 
and since the stairwells were full of 
black, toxic smoke, the tenants had no 
means of escape. The smoke spread so 
widely that victims were found on 
every floor. The fatalities were tenants 
who died from severe smoke inhalation 
from cardiac and respiratory arrest. 
Almost all of the victims came from 
a single town in Gambia. The Gambian 
community has had roots in Twin 
Parks North West that date back more 
than half a century. It is hard to imag-
ine a more closely knit community, a 
community more tied by the bonds of 
faith and family and fellowship than 
the 
Gambian 
community 
of 
Twin 
Parks North West, and so the loss is 
deeply felt. 
The victims were as young as 2, and 
no older than 50. These were victims 
who had their whole lives ahead of 
them. Ousmane Konteh was only 2 
years old. 
Muhammed Drammeh celebrated his 
twelfth birthday. 
Sera Janneh was a student at Leh-
man College. She had dreams of becom-
ing a social worker of aiding those af-
flicted by trauma. 
My heart aches for the father who 
lost his wife, two daughters, and a son; 
for the mother who lost her toddler; for 
the children who lost their parents; for 
the Drammeh family who lost four 
members; and the Dukureh family who 
lost five. 
The fire at Twin Parks North West 
was as preventable as it was tragic. If 
the space heater had shut off automati-
cally, the fire would have been pre-
vented. 
If the apartment door and the stair-
well doors had closed automatically, 
the spread of the smoke would have 
been contained and countless lives 
would have been saved. 
If the building had a sprinkler sys-
tem, the fire would have been extin-
guished. 
If the building had a two-way inter-
com system, the tenants would have 
been advised by the fire department to 
remain in their homes instead of flee-
ing to a smoke-filled stairwell that had 
become a death trap. 
And if the tenants had sufficient heat 
and hot water in their homes, there 
would have been no need to use dan-
gerous space heaters in the first place. 
The use of space heaters is often a 
cry for help and a cry for heat. It is 
often an act of desperation for decent 
and dignified housing. 
Madam Speaker, the Bronx is no 
stranger to deadly fires. New York 
City’s four worst fires in the past 30 
years have all been in the Bronx, have 
all been in my district of south Bronx. 
The prevalence of deadly fires in 
south Bronx is no accident. It is a con-
sequence of systemic disinvestment 
from the lowest income communities 
of color, from places like the south 
Bronx, from the safety and quality of 
affordable housing. 
When it comes to fire safety, Amer-
ica is a tale of two countries and New 
York is a tale of two cities. If you live 
in a luxury development in Manhattan, 
then fire safety can be taken for grant-
ed. But if you live in an affordable 
housing complex in the south Bronx, 
there is no guarantee that your build-
ing will have a sprinkler system; in 
fact, it is unlikely to have one. 
There is no guarantee that your 
building will have self-closing doors. 
There is no guarantee that your build-
ing will have what experts would con-
sider 
anything 
resembling 
modern 
standards of fire safety. 
In America, poor people of color are 
left to live in conditions that put them 
at greater risk of losing everything, in-
cluding their own homes, their own 
families, their own lives from a cata-
strophic fire. 
If that is not cruel and callous, I am 
not sure what would be. We are re-
minded that safe and decent affordable 
housing is not a privilege but a right; 
not a luxury but a moral necessity; not 
an abstraction but a matter of life and 
death. Building back better should and 
must mean building back safer for 
communities long forgotten. 
On January 9, the world bore witness 
to one of the fire department’s finest 
hours of public service. It took the Her-
culean efforts of more than 200 fire-
fighters to extinguish the fires at Twin 
Parks North West. Firefighters who 
had ran out of oxygen in their tanks 
ran into burning buildings, saving lives 
at great risk to their own.

There are no words that can convey 
more powerfully the heroism shown 
than the image beside me; the image of 
Matt Zimpfer, a proud member of the 
FDNY carrying a baby, a visibly trau-
matized baby that he had rescued from 
the fire at Twin Parks North West. It 
is as much an image of our common 
humanity as it is of the FDNY’s un-
common bravery. 
For the south Bronx, January 9 is a 
day that will live in infamy, but the 
image beside me reminds me that even 
in a moment of despair, there was 
cause for hope. Even in a moment of 
tragedy and a day of infamy, heroes 
can and do emerge. 
The overwhelming sense of sorrow 
that weighs so heavily on my heart is 
rivaled only by the overwhelming grat-
itude that I feel for our heroes at the 
FDNY, a gratitude that will remain 
with me for as long as I live. 
May God bless the heroic souls of the 
FDNY, New York City’s bravest, and 
may God bless the resilient and re-
sourceful souls of the Gambian commu-
nity of Twin Parks North West. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

DEMOCRATS’ POLICIES MAKING 
LIFE MISERABLE FOR AMERICANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
there are so many things we all want 
to talk about and share, and some-
times, as Members of Congress, we run 
in front of microphones and sort of do 
the shiny, loud object of the day be-
cause, let’s face it, that gets us 
retweets 
and 
Facebook 
and 
those 
things, but they are often trite. So I 
have a handful of things I want to walk 
through, but there is going to be a con-
stant theme here. 
I am not trying to be mean, but the 
thing is—and my facts will back me 
up—that the Democrat policies, if you 
look at particularly the last 12 months, 
have made life more miserable for 
Americans, have made the working 
class and the poor working class poorer 
and actually are crushing hope. 
I want to walk through a couple of 
economic things. I am blessed to be the 
senior Republican on the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee. There is a handful 
of economists that work on our side, 
and there is a handful that work for 
left side. We have been digging and 
digging and digging, trying to under-
stand the inflation data, the amount of 
cash chasing goods, and what is hap-
pening in productivity. I hope I am 
wrong, but I am starting to see num-
bers that look like we are on the cusp 
of a wage-price spiral. 
Let’s sort of walk through our basic 
economics. You all remember your 
high school economics class, particu-
larly those of us who are old enough to 
have been in high school at the end of 
the 1970s. Businesses raise prices be-
cause their costs are going up. Typi-
cally, just like we were doing right now 
in the new year, people are getting 
their wage hikes. Most of those wage 
hikes are nothing more than to keep up 
with inflation, so you end up with this 
spike. 
There was a handful of folks on the 
Democrat side that were saying to look 
at the December number; it wasn’t 
spiking 
as 
much 
as 
the 
previous 
months. Wait till you see the January 
numbers when the wages come in, and 
then you end up with this world saying 
now businesses, organizations, govern-
ment, others, have to keep raising 
their costs, raising their prices, raising 
their taxes, others, to keep up because 
they just had to raise wages, not for 
our brothers and sisters that are out 
there working to live better but basi-
cally just to be able to purchase the 
same things. 
Except at the end of 2021, Americans 
were poorer. The fact of the matter is, 
the average American fell about 2.7 to 
3 percent poorer because inflation grew 
faster than their wages did. But there 
are lots of things in the economic lit-
erature—and I know I am geeking out 
a little bit—that you start to end up in 
this seesaw effect, what they call a 
wage-price spiral. Businesses keep hav-
ing to raise their costs because now 
they have to raise the wages, and it be-
comes a very, very ugly circle. 
A bit of trivia. How many of you here 
would immediately say to go back to 
the 1980s, particularly the early 1980s? 
It was Paul Volcker jacking up interest 
rates to just extraordinary levels that 
squeezed out inflation. That is actually 
only part of the story. If you actually 
look at the math during that time, 
there were the Reagan tax cuts, the 
first round of them. They created a 
great spike in productivity. Because 
one of the things inflation is, is I have 
too much money chasing too few goods, 
so raising interest rates, making every-
thing more expensive, still doesn’t do 
anything to make sure you are making 
more goods, more services, to fill up 
that vacuum to remove that infla-
tionary pressure. 
You actually even see some of that 
data after we did tax reform here at 
the very, very end of 2017, when you 
saw the spike in productivity. You saw 
a pretty impressive spike for 2 years of 
wages and actually falling inflation. 
Why was that? It is because expensing 
and other things we did in tax reform, 
repatriation, getting hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars from around the world 
coming back into the country, actually 
raised productivity and lowered prices. 
That is the holy grail. Right now, al-
most every policy that the administra-
tion and, I hate to say, this body is en-
gaging in is counter to that. 
We are going to walk through a cou-
ple of things here, and our argument is 
really simple. Almost every major pol-
icy set being moved forward—and I 
don’t think it is purposeful; I think it 
is a misunderstanding of the most 
basic economics—that my Democrat 
brothers and sisters are doing is actu-
ally making life more miserable. I 
don’t think it is purposeful, but it is 
economics. 
Let’s walk through the facts, just the 
actual math. I know this is always un-
comfortable, but if you actually look 
at the data that came in, when you 
look at the expenditures—because I am 
using this slide. This is actually a 2019 
slide, but it is important to set the 
base. Our brothers and sisters who are 
in the lowest quartiles—and I hate that 
term, but it is what we use in econom-
ics—dramatically more of their income 
goes to pay for housing, dramatically 
more goes to pay for their transpor-
tation and food. Those in the upper in-
comes, that is not where they live. 
Think about what has gone on in this 
last year. Most everyone who is in this 
room, probably most everyone who is 
watching this, we are the people who 
have savings. We have retirement ac-
counts. We have 401(k)’s. Life has got-
ten more expensive for us, but how 
many of you have a home that has 
gone up dramatically in value? Think 
about those lower income quartiles, 
that working poor, that middle class, 
that lower middle class. Do they have a 
home? Are they renters? How much of 
their cost is their transportation or 
just trying to provide housing? What 
we have allowed to happen inflation- 
wise is just brutalizing them. 
When you actually start to under-
stand what the policies from this last 
year have done—and I am going to 
show a number of these things, show-
ing that the left’s policies are actually 
crushing the poor, the working poor, 
and the middle class. 
The difference here, when you see 
this type of graph, is we are trying to 
sort of demonstrate that it is both the 
effects on populations where you are 
income-wise—if you are in this lower 
income, how much more the cost of 
your life is because of inflation. This is 
almost just a pure demonstration of 
who benefits and who doesn’t benefit. 
If you are a homeowner, if you are 
someone with lots of assets and the 
stock market has been really good to 
you, you have come out ahead. If you 
are like most in the middle class and 
lower, your standard of living has gone 
down. 
There is this rule of thumb from the 
top line. What are the two things you 
do to make the working poor poorer? I 
have said this dozens of times behind 
this microphone. It is inflation, and it 
is opening up the border. 
There is this economic theory—and 
this is actually old literature. It is like 
20 years old, and it actually had a num-
ber of left groups as part of the authors 
who basically said if you look at the 
working poor, a population who prob-
ably didn’t finish high school, what 
they sell is their labor, their willing-
ness to work, their willingness to 
sweat. What happens when you flood

your society, functionally, in 1 year, 
with a couple of million people with 
similar skill sets? It is just basic math. 
You functionally have devalued the 
value of their labor. You have given 
them the double whammy. You have 
created inflation, which affects the 
poor and the middle class more dra-
matically. 
You saw from the first chart how 
much more of their resources go to pay 
for housing, to pay for transportation, 
and to pay for food. Now you make 
them compete against a couple of mil-
lion people with similar skill sets. 
These aren’t IT jobs. This isn’t some-
one who is at the top of the wage scale 
and creates a multiplier of produc-
tivity in society because they are in-
venting some new app. This is the per-
son who is hanging drywall, working 
their hearts out. It is a tough job. 
Their back is aching at the end of the 
night. Now they look out and there are 
a couple of million other people in soci-
ety with similar skill sets. 
It is a level of misunderstanding. 
Some folks will come behind these 
microphones and pretend they are 
being 
compassionate, 
not 
under-
standing the cruelty of inflation and 
having an open border and how many 
working poor are getting crushed by 
this. 
I want to go a bit further. As you 
start to look at the inflation level, you 
have to understand—7 percent was sort 
of the national number, right? In mar-
kets like mine, in the Phoenix area, we 
were at 9.7 percent inflation in 2021. A 
lot of that is because I am from a 
growth area. Lots of people are aban-
doning California and Illinois and mov-
ing into my neighborhood, so much of 
my inflation is actually housing. 
We have already heard other people 
come behind the mikes, even today, 
and talk about the cost of housing. 
Well, congratulations. In other parts of 
the country, it is not 7 percent. In 
mine, it is 9.7 percent. When we look at 
the charts and the details, it really, 
really has hurt the working poor, and 
they are having trouble finding the 
most basic accommodations. 
Then we start to dig in more. The 
economists have made it very clear 
that what was allowed to go on in 
2021—the economics warns of infla-
tionary inequity. The details are pret-
ty clear. For those who have assets, 
you are going to do okay. If you are 
part of half of America who doesn’t 
have those few thousand dollars in the 
bank or owns a house or has other as-
sets, you have become poorer. The poli-
cies are making you poorer. 
I know this is uncomfortable, but 
you can’t keep campaigning and doing 
politics and saying, ‘‘We care about the 
middle class, and we care about the 
working poor,’’ and then keep adopting 
policies that make them poorer. At 
some point, the math always wins. Not 
the virtue signaling, not the rhetoric, 
it is the math. We are making half of 
our country poorer. 
One of the other projects we are 
working on in the Joint Economic 
Committee, and a couple of us on the 
Ways and Means Committee, is also 
trying to understand what other at-
tributes there are. 
I can keep coming to the microphone 
and talking about the open border, and 
we have an administration that doesn’t 
seem to give a darn because it is polit-
ical. Their base has no trouble with a 
couple of million undocumented folks 
coming into the country. 
Inflation is really, really ugly be-
cause the math is brutal. Do you have 
any sense how high interest rates have 
to go to squeeze out this inflation? I 
think there is this fantasy that four 
marginal rate increases this year some-
how are going to tap down inflation. 
I will make you a crazy—actually, it 
is not crazy; it is based on math. At the 
final quarter of this year, you may be 
seeing 10 percent inflation. I hope I am 
wrong. But I was in front of this mike 
a year ago saying I think we will be 
close to 7, and I actually underesti-
mated it. 
Going back to my opening comments, 
I really, really, really see in the num-
bers that we are on the cusp of a wage- 
price spiral, and four marginal quarter- 
point increases in interest rates ain’t 
going to cut it unless Congress dra-
matically starts to think about poli-
cies that spike productivity. Except 
you have a left that now has an article 
of faith that tax reform, that expens-
ing, these things we did in the tax code 
to bring hundreds of billions of dollars 
back into the country to get organiza-
tions to invest in plants and equipment 
to make workers more productive so 
they could be paid more—well, we can’t 
do that. Except even the liberal econo-
mists agree it worked. It turns out, you 
need to be doing things like that. 
The left’s Build Back Better social 
spending 
bill, 
because 
it 
delinks 
money, transfer payments from work, 
every dataset basically says it will con-
tinue to spike inflation. At the end of 
10 years—I came here with the paper. It 
makes it very clear. At the end of 10 
years, the working poor are poorer be-
cause of the way the left has designed 
these transfer payments without an ex-
pectation of participation in society 
and work. I thought we learned this 25 
years ago, but somehow math is her-
esy. 
b 1530 
So let’s go. What are some of the 
other attributes that make our broth-
ers and sisters in that lower middle 
class, working poor, in many of our 
neighborhoods, what else makes them 
poor? 
We have touched on inflation. We 
have touched on flooding society with 
millions of people with similar skill 
sets. When was the last time we had 
someone remind us about the con-
centration of crime? 
For most of the Members in this 
body, we don’t live in neighborhoods 
that are going to be subject to crime. 
How many Members here live behind a 
gate? How many Members here have se-
curity? 
I did a ride-along for 4 hours on Mon-
day through north central Phoenix in 
neighborhood after neighborhood after 
neighborhood. The officer I rode with 
had almost 28 years on the city of 
Phoenix police force, and the most dis-
advantaged 
neighborhoods 
had 
the 
most crime. 
Okay. There is an assault here. You 
see the person in that apartment, he is 
a drug dealer. You are realizing, it is 
the folks living in poverty who are in 
the core of the crime. And then the left 
takes a position of basically having 
verbal violence toward law enforce-
ment. 
But we know the data says, if you 
look at the concentrations of poverty, 
one of the attributes that makes some-
one poor is when someone comes and 
steals their stuff. You are trying to 
work; someone steals your tools. You 
are trying to survive; someone breaks 
into your car or steals your auto-
mobile. It is another attribute that 
once again the left’s policies are this 
constant economic violence on the 
poor. 
And then you start to go on another 
thing we are working on. This one is 
much more complex, but it is starting 
to prove the theory is true. How many 
of you have ever heard the discussion 
about health disparities? Urban poor, 
my Native American populations, even 
rural poor, there are health disparities, 
and it is absolutely true. 
Our brothers and sisters with renal 
failure, diabetes, these things, who are 
concentrated, we can almost draw data 
circles around them and say, look at 
the income inequality of this neighbor-
hood to a neighborhood that might be 
just down the street. 
We have been trying to understand 
what the attributes are. Oddly enough, 
some of the attributes aren’t race. 
They are health. They are crime. They 
are education. But the one that no one 
here has focused on is actually health. 
If you ever get a chance—and this is 
for anyone who is listening—try to find 
the data of those who are suffering 
type 2 diabetes and the concentration. 
Go find a heat map. It becomes a really 
interesting discussion because what I 
am making as my fourth attribute is 
our brothers and sisters who are sicker. 
So the left’s attitude is, well, it is 
good politics, we will just put up a 
bunch more clinics. We will help them 
manage their diabetes. Okay. That is 
an honorable thing. Wouldn’t it be 
much more compassionate to cure, to 
disrupt? 
So we do know, because it came out 
a year ago, but it is as if no one actu-
ally read it. We actually have the paper 
that was put together, a working paper 
series from the Congressional Budget 
Office. It was functionally some of the 
data within the Democrats’ H.R. 3. If 
you actually dig through the numbers 
within their working paper, it makes it 
clear that the Democrats—it is great 
politics—hey, we are going to lower 
drug prices. But the way they go about 
doing it a decade from now, so many

January 19, 2022 
cures don’t come. And as the paper 
talks about, it is the very cures for 
things like potentially diabetes and 
other ailments that are concentrated 
in our poor population. 
So it is functionally the left’s policy 
on something like H.R. 3—because if 
you think about their pricing mecha-
nism where if a drug costs more than 
this amount of money, you can’t have 
it. It is once again policy that says, we 
are going to find a way for you to live 
with your misery, but we are going to 
make living with your misery a little 
cheaper. Then I think the thing that is 
loving and more compassionate is we 
are going to find a way to cure it. It 
really is a different mindset, and that 
isn’t Republican or Democrat. It is just 
compassion. 
But it may not be great politics be-
cause the fact of the matter is, if you 
look at the mechanics within H.R. 3, 
the Democrats actually make Big 
Pharma more profitable and bigger and 
more powerful, and they wipe out the 
disrupters, the small biologics, the 
small pharma that is actual chewing 
away their book of business because 
they are curing the disease whereas Big 
Pharma over here is just maintaining 
it. 
It is the classic economic irony of 
this place acts like a protection rack-
et. We give great speeches about how 
we are going to do this, and then— 
wink, wink, nod, nod—what actually is 
happening is you are locking in some-
one’s oligopoly. 
Once again, if you go through the 
paper, it makes it really clear that the 
first couple of years there is not much 
difference because it is what is already 
in the disruptive pharmaceutical pipe-
line. And we have done presentations 
here of 100 new are-under-research and 
only a few actually succeed. But in 
about 5 or 6 years you start to see a 
collapse of those cures. Welcome to 
Democrat policy once again. 
We have come to the floor multiple 
times with H.R. 3. We have made a 
number of people very angry by refer-
ring to it as the Big Pharma protection 
act. But the math is the math. And 
now you still have additional CBO 
studies that make it clear we are tell-
ing the truth. It is what it is. 
We have actually made proposals to 
our brothers and sisters on the left say-
ing, we both are enraged at the price of 
pharmaceuticals. Believe it or not 
there are other ways to get there, and 
one of the most magical things we 
could do for society are also some of 
the kickers to make sure there are cap-
ital stacks and these other things that 
are a little geeky, but ways that that 
investment goes into the cures. 
So when you have things like a sin-
gle-shot cure for hemophilia—I did this 
presentation back in December. We 
have a proof of concept of a cure for 
type 1 diabetes. Starting out, these are 
going to be really expensive, they are 
going to be really difficult until we 
functionally turn it into a biofoundry, 
and you build the capital stack, the 
Tax Code, the incentives to do lots of 
that. But I can show you in chart after 
chart, it saves society, it saves tax-
payers a fortune in the future. 
Remember, last year’s CBO math 
said in 29 years we are $112 trillion in 
debt in publicly borrowed money in to-
day’s dollars. So that is inflation-ad-
justed dollars. And we know that num-
ber is going to spike once we get the 
math from this last fiscal year plugged 
in there. About 75 percent of that 
spending is just Medicare, that debt is 
Medicare. The other 25 percent is So-
cial Security. 
The most powerful thing you can do 
for U.S. sovereign debt is disrupt the 
price of healthcare, and our argument 
is, the greatest elegance is actually 
doing it by making people healthier. 
There is one other thing I want to 
throw in my frustration of Democrat 
policy. My expertise is more Arizona 
and not the rest of the country. We 
have seen the debate around here, lots 
of flowery words, and almost no detail 
of the reality of what is underlying the 
piece of legislation. 
Our friends on the left will come be-
hind the microphones and say it is a 
Voting Rights Act. Okay. How is giving 
a politician six to one—so you give me 
$200, and the Treasury is going to mul-
tiply it by six times—defending democ-
racy? Or is that, once again, the left 
being so much smarter than Repub-
licans are on how to try to stay in 
power? 
How about some of the other things 
that are in the Democrats’ H.R. 1 and 
H.R. 4, their Federal election bill? 
My theory is a little different than 
other folks. It is just a blatant power 
grab. It is not a power grab for the Fed-
eral Government, which it is that, but 
it is much more than that. It is a power 
grab by a party that basically is trying 
to design the election code to fit their 
fund-raising model, their campaign 
model. 
It does other things. Like down here, 
my State for functionally 18 years has 
had voter ID laws. Every dataset out 
there says you can’t find a differential 
of populations not being able to vote. 
Matter of fact, I think in my State 
some of the underlying data is African- 
American females have the highest 
participation. It is actually White 
males, particularly White rural males 
that have some of the lowest participa-
tion and some of my Native Americans. 
But that doesn’t meet the folklore that 
we get from our brothers and sisters on 
the left. 
Think about this—and this is the cir-
cle I want folks who are paying atten-
tion to get their heads around—how it 
works. So the Democrats push a voting 
rights bill, but it is really about voting 
mechanics. And what they do is they 
say, Hey, we are going to have same- 
day, automatic registration, and then 
we are going to legalize, industrialize 
ballot harvesting, and then at the same 
time we are going to do this they also 
are allowed to have, if you give them 
money, they get six to one. So why 
would you do that? 
Well, first off, as in California, the 
Democrats have built a huge infra-
structure. If you run for Congress, you 
actually take a substantial portion of 
your campaign money and hire firms 
that go knock on doors and harvest 
ballots. It is now a campaign mechanic. 
Well, what happens if you hire lots of 
people to go walk through that massive 
apartment building or this and that 
and knock on the door and say, Hey, I 
will register you right here, let’s do 
your ballot. That is functionally what 
they are doing in this legislation. 
And the beauty of it, it will ulti-
mately be taxpayers who will be fi-
nancing it because the left, to their 
credit, has spent about the last 15, 20 
years building an online contribution 
system. And here is the kicker. That 
online contribution system has trained 
contributors to the left, contributors 
to Democrats who say, don’t give one 
person this much money, give 10 people 
this much. And it is as if it has always 
been laid out the same, and—wink, 
wink, nod, nod—one day we are going 
to set up a public funding system so 
your $25 contribution or $200 contribu-
tion gets multiplied six times. 
You have got to give the left, the 
Democrats credit for their, just, audac-
ity. And then to call it a civil rights 
voting bill when, when you break 
through its mechanics, it is about 
power, it is about power and control. 
That is what this is. 
The other beauty is handing the bu-
reaucracy here in Washington, D.C., 
the functionality of saying they can 
tell my State of Arizona what is al-
lowed and what isn’t allowed. 
We have a family saying that goes, 
money, power, vanity, but most of the 
time it is about the money. In this 
case, I have got to give the left credit. 
They hit all three in the same piece of 
legislation. 
It 
becomes 
about 
the 
money, it becomes about them keeping 
the power, but reality has almost noth-
ing to do with fairness. It is about the 
fear that the public understands how 
much of the left’s policies have been 
crappy to them, their families, this 
country. The mechanism they are 
going to try to keep in power is to 
functionally have us finance their elec-
tions and allow them to industrialize 
the very bad acts that so many of us 
worry about. 
Madam Speaker, I think I feel a little 
better getting some of that out of my 
system. I yield back the balance of my 
time.

Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
there are several issues of importance 
that I don’t feel this body has spent 
enough time discussing, and unless

H250 
January 19, 2022 
they are addressed could result in a 
great deal of discomfort for a lot of 
Americans. 
The first is the issue concerning shel-
tered workshops, also known as work 
centers or community rehabilitation 
programs. 
Perhaps you folks are familiar with 
them. They are places where people of 
different abilities frequently work, fre-
quently doing packaging, maybe light 
manufacturing. 
Because of the different abilities that 
some people have, they have to get 
what are called 14(c) certificates and 
may work for less than minimum wage. 
Disabilities they may have would in-
clude things like perhaps spina bifida 
or similar things that make it a little 
bit more difficult for them to work. 
Nevertheless, throughout my polit-
ical career I have always enjoyed tour-
ing the sheltered workshops in part be-
cause the employees that work there 
are so proud of the work they are doing 
and so proud of the fact that they are 
able to earn a paycheck and purchase 
some of their own clothes, perhaps pur-
chase gifts for their relatives. 
Right now these sheltered workshops 
are under attack in the Build Back 
Better bill, and that bill may easily 
pass some time in the next year. I am 
afraid even the majority of Democrats 
who voted for the bill are unaware that 
these sheltered workshops are under 
attack. 
There are two reasons why people 
want to get rid of sheltered workshops. 
There are people who feel under no cir-
cumstances should somebody make less 
than minimum wage. This is ignoring 
the economic reality and ignoring the 
reality of the type of jobs that are 
available for these folks. 
The second concern they have is they 
feel that these people are segregated 
from the rest of society working in a 
sheltered workshop. That is, of course, 
not true. There are people of all sorts 
of abilities in these workshops; and in 
my opinion, people who work in these 
workshops frequently work there for 25 
or 30 years. And people in management 
also work there for an extended period 
of time. 
Nevertheless, there is an extreme 
group which feels that we are taking 
advantage of people by having them 
work in the workshop. 
I will point out that in addition to 
the ability to have some of your own 
economic independence, you develop 
lifelong friends in these workshops 
that you wouldn’t develop if you were 
looking for other jobs out in the com-
munity. 
One of the concerns for people with 
different abilities is that it is impor-
tant that they develop friendships 
other than just their parents or imme-
diate family. It is something that is al-
ways of great concern for parents of 
people in situations like this, and inso-
far as the sheltered workshops were 
shut down, you wouldn’t have this nat-
ural grouping of friends or lifelong co-
workers that you are going to be able 
to interact with. 
It is time for the sheltered workshop 
community to wake up and realize in 
this bill of thousands of pages the rad-
ical group that wants to shut down the 
sheltered workshops may finally get 
their dream. And if they get their 
dream, they will find that some of 
these folks are going to find jobs in the 
community, but they are not going to 
find 35 or 40 hour a week jobs in the 
community. They may find 3 or 4 hour 
a week jobs in the community. They 
will lose the pride that comes with 
having a full-time job. They will no 
longer feel they are like their siblings 
or friends who go to work every day 
and earn a paycheck. It will be dev-
astating for these folks. Some folks 
have been working in these sheltered 
workshops for 25 or 30 years and have 
years left to go. It is tragic that some 
people want to take this freedom away 
from them. 
I should also point out that nobody 
forces anybody to work in these shel-
tered workshops. If there were other 
jobs in the community they or their 
guardians could take them out and 
have them work fast food or have them 
work light retail or have them work in 
some light manufacturing. But what 
these people who are trying to get rid 
of these sheltered workshops are doing 
is they are taking away the choice that 
these folks have made for themselves, 
the choice that makes them feel so 
happy, makes them feel so good. 
So I strongly encourage people who 
know someone in these workshops to 
get politically involved before these 
folks’ lives are devastated. 
And insofar as we have any of the 
Democrats paying attention to what I 
am saying right now, I beg you to go in 
your district and tour one of the shel-
tered workshops yourself because they 
will make you feel so good. 
There are very few things in this job 
that make me feel as good as touring 
these workshops because you see how 
happy and productive people can be 
that on the face of it seem to be dealt 
a tough hand in life. But they have 
made what they can of themselves. 
They are very happy. And I beg the ma-
jority party not to take away this 
right. 
The second issue that I would like to 
talk about a little bit today is with re-
gard to COVID. 
One of the frustrating things about 
the establishment—and I think this 
goes back even before the Biden admin-
istration—is there has not been enough 
discussion of the correlation of inad-
equate amounts of Vitamin D and get-
ting severe cases of COVID. 
Right now in this country, all Ameri-
cans should be aiming at having 30 
nanograms per milliliter of Vitamin D. 
People 
who 
fail 
to 
get 
that 
30 
nanograms disproportionately wind up 
getting COVID and getting COVID se-
verely. 
There are other things that make 
you more likely to get COVID. If you 
have diabetes, if you are overweight, 
these are other things that correlate 
with getting COVID. And we know that 
if you lose a little weight, your situa-
tion would improve. 
Vitamin D or a lack of having 30 
nanograms per milliliter of Vitamin D 
does correlate with problems. Right 
now in our society, sadly, 96 percent of 
Black Americans are insufficient to 
that level, 88 percent of Hispanics, 65 
percent of Whites. It is not something 
that has been talked about anywhere 
near enough, and it is a question as to 
why the public health establishment 
has not done a better job of explaining 
the correlation between bad Vitamin D 
outcomes and bad COVID outcomes. 
Some people feel it is not something 
that is talked about enough because 
there is no money to be made. And, of 
course, a lot of people are making a lot 
of money on COVID; but if you solve 
your Vitamin D levels by just going to 
the local drugstore and buying 20 or $40 
worth of Vitamin D pills, there is not 
the possibility of people to make bil-
lions of dollars. 
Nevertheless, if you are out there, I 
strongly encourage all Americans to 
get a hold of Vitamin D. Vitamin C and 
zinc are good, as well, but today I try 
one more time to beg my friends back 
home to go get some Vitamin D, and I 
beg the medical community who right 
now does not test for Vitamin D like 
they should; I am told it is because 
there is not enough reimbursement in 
Medicare, and we don’t want to lose 
money on what we are doing, but the 
medical community ought to be testing 
everybody for Vitamin D if they come 
in for their annual checkup. All Ameri-
cans should be looking to get that level 
above 30 nanograms per milliliter. 
There are other things, as well, that 
could be done to reduce the high num-
ber of deaths from COVID. Fenofibrate 
is a drug which some Israeli research-
ers had success with. It is a generic 
drug, and as a result, it is very reason-
able to get a hold of. The same thing is 
true with hydroxychloroquine. And 
there are doctors I know who have had 
success with that. I don’t think it is 
quite as successful with the omicron 
variant, but it was very successful with 
the 
alpha 
variant. 
And 
there 
is 
ivermectin, and I have known doctors 
who have used that, and they have had 
success curing people there. But for 
whatever reason, on some of these 
cheaper alternatives that I think could 
have saved hundreds of thousands of 
people, the public health establishment 
and the medical establishment has not 
been as outspoken as they should. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Wisconsin for yielding 
on this very important subject. I was 
unfortunate to catch COVID a couple 
weeks ago, and I think that the Vita-
min D supplements I was taking in ad-
dition to Vitamin C, in addition to zinc 
definitely 
helped 
to 
minimize 
the 
length and the severity of the illness. 
Madam Speaker, today marks 1 year 
since Joe Biden was sworn in as Presi-
dent, meaning it has been a year since

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H251 
January 19, 2022 
Democrats took unified control of the 
Federal Government. 
And at this point there is no denying 
that Americans are worse off today 
than they were 12 months ago. 
Consumer prices have risen 7 percent 
since Democrats won congressional 
majorities and the White House, mark-
ing a 40-year high rate of inflation. 
Gas prices reached $3.28 a gallon last 
month, a 49.6 percent increase from a 
year ago. 
1.7 illegal immigrants were encoun-
tered unlawfully crossing the border in 
FY21, the highest number ever re-
corded. 
Sixteen major U.S. cities set new 
homicide records this past year. 
And just last week, COVID hos-
pitalizations hit a record high. 
Thirteen American servicemembers 
tragically lost their lives, and the 
Taliban captured Afghanistan as a re-
sult of this administration’s disastrous 
withdrawal plan. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats are cer-
tainly setting records, just not the 
records that they want to be breaking. 
Their party has utterly failed the 
American people. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to address another, perhaps 
inadvertent, 
perhaps 
not 
so 
inad-
vertent, group of provisions in the 
Build Back Better bill. 
As we look across the country, when 
one compares to where America is 
today compared to where America was 
50 years ago, certainly one area that I 
think most Americans would think is a 
step in the wrong direction is the 
breakdown of the traditional family. 
However, not all people consider the 
breakdown in the so-called western 
prescribed nuclear family structure as 
a bad thing. 
Black Lives Matter, which played 
such a big role in the elections last No-
vember, on their website came out say-
ing we want to disrupt the western pre-
scribed nuclear family structure. 
They are not the only ones who don’t 
like the western family. We know Karl 
Marx felt that as he wanted to work 
his way towards paradise, we had to get 
rid of the traditional family. 
I don’t know whether it is a coinci-
dence or not, but our current welfare 
system with all of the programs that 
are part of it, be it the education 
grants, be it the medical grants, be it 
the food stamps, be it the low-income 
housing, are all set not to benefit fami-
lies in which there are two parents at 
home to raise the children. 
In other words, the United States for 
years and years has been trying to get 
rid of the nuclear family. It is like Karl 
Marx himself were writing the welfare 
policies. 
In the Build Back Better bill, we are 
going further on down this line. I don’t 
know that this is exactly supposed to 
be a pay back to Black Lives Matter, 
but the reconciliation bill will more 
than double the earned income tax 
credit marriage penalty. It has provi-
sions for greatly increasing the number 
of low-income housing units. And I feel 
that the way those units are doled out, 
again, very difficult to get those units 
if you have a mom and dad at home. 
But there are people who want to get 
rid of that sort of family. 
I would strongly encourage the ma-
jority party, before they push this bill 
any further, to have a study done on 
who benefits from these new provisions 
and who doesn’t, and is it one more 
time a situation which we are bribing 
people not to have old-fashioned nu-
clear families. 
b 1600 
I am afraid, like I said, right now, 
this looks like another victory for the 
hard leftwing of the Democratic Party 
that embraces the idea that we ought 
to get rid of the nuclear family. It is 
not a coincidence. It is in the bill. 
In any event, these are things I will 
leave our audience with as we break for 
the following week. If you know some-
body who works in a sheltered work-
shop or work center, or know a Con-
gressman, invite them to the sheltered 
workshops to see what they are in dan-
ger of shutting down. 
If you know people who do not yet 
have COVID, remind them to get more 
vitamin D. If there are any doctors out 
there—I know sometimes you can’t be 
reimbursed for everything, but you 
guys make enough money—make sure 
you begin to do some testing of vita-
min D levels so that if people are below 
30 nanograms per milliliter, they know 
it and they know that they should go 
to the drugstore and begin to get more 
vitamin D, together with zinc and vita-
min C. 
Finally, I encourage the majority 
party, before they do any more with 
Build Back Better, to have some work 
done and see whether you really want 
to go ahead and further steepen the 
penalty for married couples who have 
children, which already, like I said, is 
like the policy of the United States: We 
don’t want to have old-fashioned nu-
clear families. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader, Senator SCHUMER, is 
recognized. 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in the 
fall of 1868, recently freed African- 
American men participated in Federal 
elections for the first time in American 
history. According to Ron Chernow’s 
biography of Ulysses S. Grant, the im-
pacts of expanding the vote were im-
mediate and dramatic. 
In a startling reversal for an area once 
dominated by slavery, the elections spawned 
black sheriffs, school board members, state 
legislators, and congressmen. That yester-
day’s slave laborer was today’s state legis-
lator horrified many white southerners who 
refused to accept this extraordinary inver-
sion of their bygone world. 
Naturally, the opponents of voting 
rights had an answer. Chernow con-
tinues: 
[T]o circumvent the fifteenth amendment, 
white politicians in Georgia [and other 
states] devised new methods of stripping 
blacks of voting rights, including poll taxes, 
onerous registration requirements— 
Let me repeat that quote. 
[O]nerous registration requirements, and 
similar restrictions copied in other states. 
Many attempts were made by this 
very body to stop these sinister laws, 
but the result was ultimately a failure. 
By 1877, ‘‘the black community in the 
South steadily lost ground until a rigid 
apartheid separated the races com-
pletely, a terrible state of affairs that 
would not be fixed until the rise of the 
civil rights movement after World War 
II.’’ 
Today, the U.S. Senate meets in a 
different century, facing new and dif-
ferent dangers but wrestling with the 
same fundamental question: How will 
the Members of this body protect and 
expand the most basic right of Amer-
ican citizens, the wellspring of our de-
mocracy, the thing that distinguished 
America from all of the countries in 
Europe when it was established in, 
first, 1776 and then 1789—the right to 
vote—the most important wellspring of 
our democracy, the most important 
feature of our democracy? 
How will the Members of this body 
expand and protect the most basic 
right—the right to vote—from forces, 
right now in the 21st century, con-
spiring to take it away? 
That is why, today, the U.S. Senate 
will debate legislation to protect our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S278 
January 19, 2022 
democracy, and the eyes of history— 
the eyes of history—are upon us. 
The question that is before us today 
is as old as the Republic itself. The 
story of democracy has been a long 
march toward universal suffrage, a 
holy struggle to take the vision of our 
Framers and make it real in the 
present. 
The march, unfortunately, has often 
not been linear. At the time of our 
Constitution’s ratification, you had to 
be, in many States, a White, male, 
Protestant, landowner to vote. How 
many in this Chamber would have been 
able to participate in those early elec-
tions? 
Throughout our Nation’s history, 
moments of significant progress have 
often been followed by reactionary 
backlash. Unfortunately, it seems—led 
by one party, compelled by the most 
dishonest President in our history—we 
are in another of those dark periods. 
That is why, for the first time—the 
first time—in this Congress, the Senate 
is debating and will vote on legislation 
to confront these threats: the Freedom 
to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
For the information of all, debate on 
these bills will continue throughout 
the day. And as soon as 6:30, if not a 
little bit later, we will hold a cloture 
vote to conclude debate and proceed to 
final passage on these measures. 
I want to thank my colleagues who 
spoke yesterday in favor of these bills. 
There were so many eloquent and 
strong speeches. At our caucus, I have 
rarely seen such passion about the need 
to vote and the need to change the 
rules to allow these vital bills—so fixed 
upon the wellspring of our democracy, 
voting—to pass. 
If the Republicans block cloture on 
the legislation before us, I will put for-
ward a proposal to change the Senate 
rules to allow for a talking filibuster 
on this legislation, as recommended by 
a number of our colleagues who have 
been working on this reform for a very 
long time. 
Make no mistake, win, lose, or draw, 
Members of this Chamber were elected 
to debate and to vote, particularly on 
such an important issue as this. And 
win, lose, or draw, we are going to 
vote—we are going to vote—especially 
when the issue relates to the beating 
heart of our democracy, as voting 
rights does. 
For 
months, 
Senate 
Republicans 
have resisted virtually every attempt 
at holding a bipartisan debate on vot-
ing rights legislation. Senate Demo-
crats have certainly tried to bring 
them onto the table. 
Senate Democrats have certainly 
been willing to compromise to get 
something done. My colleagues Sen-
ators MANCHIN and KAINE and TESTER 
and KING and DURBIN and KLOBUCHAR 
and LEAHY—and many more—have all 
met with Republicans to initiate a dia-
logue, dating back to last August, if 
not earlier. At virtually every turn, we 
have been met with resistance. 
And 
amazingly 
enough, 
my 
col-
leagues—none of them are here to hear 
it—our Republican colleagues don’t 
even acknowledge that we have a cri-
sis. Leader MCCONNELL even claimed 
that ‘‘States are not engaged in trying 
to suppress voters whatsoever.’’ 
Let me read that quote again. This is 
from Leader MCCONNELL’s words: 
States are not engaging in trying to sup-
press voters whatsoever. 
I would ask the Republican leader, if 
there is no effort to suppress the vote, 
why have 19 States passed 33 new laws 
making it harder for Americans to par-
ticipate in our elections, in the after-
math of one of the safest elections in 
American recent history, where there 
is virtually no evidence of any mate-
rial fraud—none. 
If there is no effort to suppress the 
vote, why are States from Texas to 
Montana restricting the number and 
hours of polling places? Why have 
States like Florida and Texas made it 
harder 
to 
register—to 
register—to 
vote? Is that not suppressing the vote? 
Why are States like Iowa cutting 
down on the number of days you can 
vote early? Is that not suppressing the 
vote? 
And if there is no effort to suppress 
the vote, why have States like Georgia 
made it a crime for volunteers to give 
food and water to voters standing in 
line at the polls? 
Leader MCCONNELL, once again: 
States are not engaging in trying to sup-
press voters whatsoever. 
Just as Donald Trump has his Big 
Lie, Leader MCCONNELL now has his: 
States are not engaging in trying to sup-
press voters whatsoever. 
The same types of lies that have mo-
tivated—the same type of Big Lie that 
Donald Trump put forward has now 
motivated 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
and 
many other Republicans to embrace 
that Big Lie and spout others that 
come from the same poisonous tree. 
And what is even more galling, know-
ing our history, that the laws that I 
spoke of a minute ago don’t target ev-
eryone. This is not an effort aimed at 
everyone. They are aimed particularly 
at people of color, at poor people, at 
young people, at disabled people, at el-
derly people, at people who live in cit-
ies. Given the long history, particu-
larly against African Americans, Black 
Americans, of suppressing the vote in 
every kind of way possible, this is par-
ticularly disgraceful, particularly ab-
horrent, particularly obnoxious. 
We all know the game here today, ex-
emplified by every seat being empty 
when we are having our first debate 
about voting rights, not because Re-
publicans agreed to go along but be-
cause we were able to use a message 
from the House to go forward without 
their OK. 
So we all know the game here. To 
date, I don’t know if any of you have, 
but I have not heard a single serious 
defense of these laws from Senate Re-
publicans. They don’t come here to the 
floor to defend what is going on in the 
States. What we have heard is soph-
istry, 
distractions, 
and 
outright 
gaslighting. 
For 
months, 
Senate 
Republicans 
have come up with excuses and subter-
fuges to avoid doing the right thing, 
just like others have come up with 
similar lame excuses and subterfuges 
in the past. But this is the 21st cen-
tury. We are supposed to have gone be-
yond that, but unfortunately we have 
not. Facts are stubborn, and today’s 
debate will help us arrive at the facts 
of voter suppression before we vote to 
take action. As we debate this issue so 
critical to the wellspring of our democ-
racy, will we all confront a critical 
question: Shall Members of this Cham-
ber do what is necessary to pass these 
bills and move them to the President’s 
desk? 
It is my hope that courage awakens 
within the heart of our Republican col-
leagues before the day is out. But if the 
Senate cannot protect the right to 
vote, protect the cornerstone of our de-
mocracy under the existing rules, then 
the Senate rules must be reformed. 
Let me say this. We have diverse 
views about whether the filibuster 
today in 21st century America is a good 
thing or a bad thing. And there are 
some in our caucus who believe it helps 
bring—a few who believe it helps 
bring—us together. I don’t see evidence 
of that at all, and I think the majority 
of my colleagues will agree with that. 
But even for those who feel that the fil-
ibuster is a good thing and helps bring 
us together, I would ask this question: 
Isn’t the protection of voting rights, 
the most fundamental wellspring of 
this democracy, more important? Isn’t 
protecting 
voting 
rights 
and 
pre-
venting their diminution more impor-
tant than a rule in the Senate, which 
has not always been in existence and 
was not envisioned by the Founders? 
That is the question we should ask our-
selves. 
Our proposal for a talking filibuster 
on these pieces of legislation would be 
the first step toward passing voting 
rights, restoring this body, and break-
ing the gridlock that we now face on 
this vital issue. 
In this body, proponents of our demo-
cratic rights, again and again, have 
brought legislation to the floor only to 
be met by a filibuster. Opponents of 
fair, open elections filibustered anti- 
poll tax legislation in 1942, 1944, 1946. 
They filibustered the civil rights bill of 
1960. They filibustered legislation on 
literacy tests in 1962—all this before 
real substantive progress was made. 
Our struggle today is not new, but we 
must nevertheless meet it with re-
newed conviction. Senate Democrats 
are under no illusion that we face an 
uphill fight, especially when virtually 
every 
Republican 
has 
remained 
staunchly against every attempt to 
pass voting rights legislation. Again, I 
would remind the American people and 
every one of my colleagues that this is 
a different Republican Party controlled

S279 
January 19, 2022 
by Donald Trump. Ronald Reagan, 
George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush 
all supported renewal of the Voting 
Rights Act—every one of them—and it 
received large bipartisan majorities in 
the Senate. 
It is a different Republican Party, 
not just on so many issues that we de-
bate but on this issue, the wellspring of 
our democracy. So we know it is an up-
hill fight. But whenever this Chamber 
confronts a question this important, 
one so vital to our country, you don’t 
slide it off the table and say, ‘‘Never 
mind.’’ You don’t say, ‘‘We are not 
going to deal with this issue head-on.’’ 
The Senators’ job is to vote and to 
vote on the most important issues fac-
ing us, and vote we will, and we are 
going to keep pushing. We are going to 
keep working. We are going to keep 
fighting long after today because the 
issue is so important to all of us. 
I believe firmly in my bones, Mr. 
President, that if we follow Dr. King’s 
advice to just ‘‘keep moving,’’ history 
shows that doing the right thing will 
eventually prevail. Justice will flow 
like the mighty waters, as the Prophet 
Amos has said. 
But the work of justice does not stir 
into action on its own. It is up to us, 
Members of this body and Americans 
all across the country, to do our part 
to make justice come alive today and 
assure that our country does not back-
slide here in the 21st century. 
So I urge my colleagues, for the sake 
of our beautiful, wonderful democracy, 
for the sake of what the Founding Fa-
thers called this ‘‘noble experiment,’’ 
take a stand and do everything, every-
thing, everything you can to protect 
voting rights today—today—in this 
Chamber. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Republican leader is recognized. 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Democratic Party has had control of 
Washington for exactly 364 days. To-
morrow will mark exactly 1 year since 
President Biden was inaugurated on 
the 
West 
Front 
and 
promised 
to 
‘‘unit[e] our people,’’ ‘‘lower the tem-
perature,’’ and brin[g] America to-
gether.’’ But today, the President and 
his party will try to use fear and panic 
to smash the Senate, silence millions 
of Americans, and seize control of our 
democracy. 
Now, there is no shortage of real cri-
ses Democrats might consider tackling: 
the worst inflation in 40 years, the 
seemingly endless pandemic, soaring 
homicides, the border crisis, and Rus-
sia flirting with war in Europe. 
But the administration and this Sen-
ate majority are focused on none of 
that. Instead, they have been consumed 
by a fake panic over election laws that 
seem to exist only in their own imagi-
nations. 
So let’s put a few basic facts on the 
table. Fewer than one-half of 1 percent 
of American adults believe that elec-
tion law is our country’s most impor-
tant problem. When polls ask people 
what new Federal election laws they 
want, the most popular response is 
‘‘none of the above.’’ 
Actually, more Americans believe 
current voting laws are too lax than 
believe they are too restrictive. Let 
that sink in. You could have taken in 
hundreds of hours of leftwing rhetoric 
and media coverage over the past year 
and had no inkling of this basic fact. 
Significantly more Americans believe 
current voting laws are too loose and 
insecure than believe are too restric-
tive. 
Professional liberals have spent 3 
straight years talking down our democ-
racy, except a short period after they 
liked an election result and ques-
tioning elections was, at least briefly, 
off limits. But the American people are 
not buying that. Democrats have spent 
years stoking fear and panic over vot-
ing laws and the American people sim-
ply do not buy it. But while Wash-
ington 
Democrats’ 
fake 
panic 
has 
failed to persuade the country, it could 
still deal permanent damage. 
Today, the Senate will need to pre-
vent this factional frenzy from dam-
aging our democracy, damaging the 
Senate, and damaging our Republic for-
ever. 
First, our democracy. Professional 
liberals’ fake hysteria over State vot-
ing laws is literally collapsing before 
our eyes. Even normally friendly media 
outlets are asking Democrats why a 
law like Georgia’s is supposed to be 
outrageous when it is objectively more 
open than rules in blue States like 
Delaware and New York. President 
Biden’s false statement about one 
State law earned him—listen to this— 
‘‘four Pinocchios’’ in the Washington 
Post. That is not easy to get. There is 
no factual standard by which any State 
in America is creating a civil rights 
crisis, not compared to their own 
prepandemic baselines, not comparing 
across with other States. 
What is more, Democrats’ own paper 
trails refute the notion that this is 
about new State laws from 2021. Three 
years ago, in 2019, Leader SCHUMER was 
already giving interviews about sup-
posed voter suppression. The same con-
spiracy theories were being pushed 
back 
then. 
The 
same 
ominous 
buzzwords were in vogue. And 3 years 
ago, in 2019, Democrats had already in-
troduced their first version of the legis-
lation they will be pushing today. 
This party-line push has never been 
about securing citizens’ rights. It is 
about expanding politicians’ power. 
That is why their bill tries to weaken 
voter ID laws that are popular with 
Americans of all races. That is why 
their bill is stuffed with strange poli-
cies that have zero relationship to bal-
lot access, new powers for bureaucrats 
to police citizens’ speech online, new 
schemes where the Federal Govern-
ment would directly fund political 
campaigns. 
This is not some modest bill about 
ballot access. It is a sprawling take-
over of our whole political system. It 
was never even intended to attract bi-
partisan support. This partisan Frank-
enstein bill that the House Democrats 
slapped together was intended to do 
one thing, just one thing only: Give the 
Senate Democratic leader a pretext—a 
pretext—to break the Senate. 
Later today, this Chamber will host a 
sad spectacle that has not been seen 
before in living memory. A sitting ma-
jority leader will attempt a direct as-
sault on the core identity of the Sen-
ate. Our colleague from New York will 
try to kill the character of the institu-
tion he is supposed to protect and to 
serve. 
Now, the Democratic leader once said 
that breaking the rules to kill the fili-
buster would turn the Senate into a 
‘‘rubberstamp of dictatorship,’’ make 
America a ‘‘banana republic’’ and trig-
ger ‘‘a doomsday for democracy.’’ 
Several years ago, with no connec-
tion to this particular issue, he began 
talking about shredding minority pro-
tections if—if—he ever got power. 
And now he wants to press that 
doomsday button. 
The legislative filibuster is a central 
Senate tradition. It is the indispen-
sable feature of our institution. It 
makes the Senate serve its founding 
purpose—forging compromise, cooling 
passions, and ensuring that new laws 
earn broad support from a cross section 
of our country. 
The Senate is not supposed to be a 
duplicate House of Representatives 
with fewer Members and fancier desks. 
This body is not supposed to amplify 
huge swings in Federal law with every 
election. It exists to slow those swings 
and to bring stability. 
The legislative filibuster is the only 
reason the Senate provides what James 
Madison called a ‘‘complicated check’’ 
on ‘‘improper acts of legislation.’’ It 
embodies Thomas Jefferson’s principle 
that ‘‘great innovations should not be 
forced on slender majorities.’’ 
Killing the legislative filibuster—any 
way it happened—would hugely damage 
the Senate, but doing so by nuking the 
rules would destroy the Senate. As I 
have explained at some length, this is 
true on the most practical level. A Sen-
ate in nuclear winter would not be a 
hospitable place for either side. 
As then-Senator Obama explained a 
decade and a half ago, ‘‘If the majority 
chooses to end the filibuster, if they 
choose to change the rules and put an 
end to democratic debate, then the 
fighting and the bitterness and the 
gridlock will only get worse.’’ 
Please note that, even in the Demo-
cratic leader’s manufactured case, even 
when he presumably wanted the most 
persuasive theater he could possibly 
muster, the Senate will have only 
spent about a day and a half on this 
bill before he tries to ram it through. 
Since when does the Senate pass any 
significant bill in a day and a half, 
much less a gigantic elections over-
haul? Our colleague is not trying to 
conclude an unending discussion that

January 19, 2022 
he cannot stop; he is trying to short 
circuit a debate that he cannot win. 
This is just the kind of shortsighted 
power grab this body was actually built 
to stop. 
The case that most of our Demo-
cratic colleagues are making this week 
boils down to a claim that everything 
is somehow broken. The Senate is bro-
ken because they can’t get everything 
they want. Our democracy is broken 
because 
Democrats 
sometimes 
lose 
elections. Entire States are broken be-
cause voters vote the wrong way, and 
so their voices in this Chamber should 
be totally silenced. Millions of Amer-
ican voters should be denied any say 
whatsoever in this Chamber. Really? 
Really? 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
claiming our entire Republic is bro-
ken? That is what their anger and pes-
simism boils down to. 
They say that we are hopelessly di-
vided; that governing institutions that 
have served us for centuries need to be 
smashed and steamrolled; that we are 
fated to keep escalating brute-force 
battles with no end in sight. This is ex-
actly the kind of toxic world view that 
this President pledged to disavow, but 
it is exactly what has consumed his 
party on his watch. You can literally 
hear it in their voices. 
In the last few days, our President 
and his top allies have been reduced to 
shouting angrily at reporters and at 
the American people. They are so cer-
tain they know best. How dare the 
rules, how dare the facts, the Repub-
licans, and millions of voters all ob-
struct their unique wisdom? 
Well, the good news is that the fear is 
false. The rage is misplaced. And 
today, factional fevers will not carry 
the day. 
The Senate is not broken. We have 
passed major, bipartisan bills this year, 
and we have stopped partisan bills that 
lack 
support; 
exactly—exactly—the 
mixture the Framers imagined and 
Senators 
on 
both 
sides 
praised— 
praised—until the last few months. Our 
democracy is not broken either. Citi-
zens across America have ample oppor-
tunity to vote and say so to anybody 
who will listen to them. Our Republic 
is not broken. Even with all the crises 
that Democrats’ policies have created, 
we remain fellow citizens who are 
blessed to live in the greatest country 
on Earth. 
Today, it appears that a narrow, bi-
partisan majority of Senators will vote 
to save the Senate. With hope, with 
confidence, we will stand up and say 
that our institutions are worth pro-
tecting; that rules matter; that no 
American deserves to have his or her 
voice in this Chamber silenced. Ah, but 
a partisan minority will do the oppo-
site. They will try to smash and grab 
as much short-term power as they can 
carry. 
For both groups of Senators, this 
vote will echo for generations. Before 
we part ways tonight, all 100 of us will 
have marked our legacies in permanent 
ink. Who will vote with hope and con-
fidence in our people, and who will vote 
from anger, fear, and fake panic? Who 
will vote to protect checks and bal-
ances, and who will try to purchase 
power at any price? Who has the cour-
age to protect every single American 
voice in this Chamber, no matter their 
home State, no matter their politics, 
and who will vote to silence millions of 
citizens for the sin of voting for the 
wrong team? The American people de-
serve to know, and from this day for-
ward, they will. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
say to the Republican leader while he 
is still on the floor, would you enter-
tain a question? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Excuse me. No. 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry that he did 
not stay for a question because I would 
have asked the basic question phrased 
by Senator SCHUMER: Does he really be-
lieve that there is no evidence of voter 
suppression in the actions of 19 States 
across our Nation? I think the facts 
speak for themselves. 
For those who are witnessing this, 
this is a rare moment in the history of 
this Chamber. In the recent history, it 
is rare because we are here; half of the 
seats are occupied in the U.S. Senate. 
That is a rare occurrence because it is 
rare that we come together to debate, 
to amend, or to even exercise the au-
thority given to us as U.S. Senators. 
It is also a rare moment in history 
because we again are being called on, 
as others have before us, to speak to 
the fundamentals of freedom and de-
mocracy and to go on record by the end 
of this day, when night falls, as to 
where we stand in the sweep of history. 
Approximately 155 million Americans 
voted in the 2020 election—highest 
voter-turnout percentage since the 1900 
election. A record number voted early 
or cast mail-in ballots—options that 
were expanded in red and blue States in 
response to a deadly pandemic. That 
was before we had vaccines, and COVID 
was killing an average of 1,200 Ameri-
cans a day. Yet they voted. Tens of 
millions of Americans stood in line, 
some for hours, to cast their ballots. 
That is how important the American 
people thought it was to vote in 2020. 
People risked their lives to cast their 
ballots. It is hard to believe that fact 
could be measured against statements 
made by the Republican leader just a 
few moments ago that people don’t 
care about the right to vote. They care 
enough to risk their lives, and they did 
in the 2020 election. 
Despite the crush of voters and the 
confusion of the pandemic, the 2020 
election was judged ‘‘the most secure 
in American history.’’ That is not my 
opinion; that is the official statement 
issued by the Department of Homeland 
Security’s Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency under the 
Trump 
administration, 
an 
Agency 
which coordinates the Nation’s top cy-
bersecurity and voting infrastructure 
security. They released their assess-
ment 10 days after the 2020 election, 
and they did so to counter a dangerous 
and unprecedented avalanche of misin-
formation—including from an enraged 
and defeated President—claiming false-
ly the election had been stolen. 
These nonpartisan election security 
experts were not alone in rejecting 
Donald Trump’s Big Lie. President 
Trump and his loyalists filed more 
than 60 lawsuits in State and Federal 
courts, repeating their false claims of 
voter fraud and stolen votes. They of-
fered 
no 
evidence 
to 
back 
their 
claims—only bizarre conspiracy theo-
ries and far-right internet gossip. Their 
lawsuits 
were 
overwhelmingly 
dis-
missed, some by judges whom Presi-
dent Trump himself had nominated. 
The former President exerted extraor-
dinary pressure on the Department of 
Justice—we found that in the Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 
and 
through 
other sources—and he failed. 
When he couldn’t bully the courts or 
the Justice Department to do his bid-
ding, he summoned his mob. We all 
know personally about the death and 
destruction the Big Lie brought to this 
building on January 6, a year ago. We 
lived through it. The Capitol survived 
it. The entire world recoiled at the 
sight of Americans, goaded by the 
former President, attacking the heart 
of our democracy. 
The Big Lie is corroding Americans’ 
faith in our elections. In a recent poll, 
two-thirds of Republicans—two-thirds 
of Republicans—surveyed agreed with 
the false claim that ‘‘voter fraud 
helped Joe Biden win the 2020 elec-
tion’’—two-thirds of Republicans. That 
poll also found that 64 percent of Amer-
icans believe that U.S. democracy is 
‘‘in crisis and at risk of failing.’’ 
Senator MCCONNELL
dismisses this 
conversation, but the American people 
know it is deadly serious. 
In another poll, only one in three Re-
publicans said that they trust that the 
2024 elections will be fair regardless of 
who wins—only one in three Repub-
licans. 
Donald Trump would rather destroy 
American democracy than admit he 
lost the election, and sadly, it seems 
that 
many 
Republican 
lawmakers 
would rather repeat his lies than face 
his wrath. 
Republican 
lawmakers 
of 
many 
States are using the Big Lie as a pre-
text to pass new laws aimed at under-
mining both Americans’ right to vote 
and the integrity of our elections. 
Sadly, Republicans in the Senate are 
aiding and abetting this attack. Three 
times last year, the Republicans used 
the filibuster—the weapon of choice in 
the Jim Crow era—to block this Senate 
from even debating voting rights. 
Each morning, we stand and pledge 
allegiance to that flag and what it rep-
resents, but I don’t believe any Senator 
stands to pledge allegiance to the fili-
buster. 
The filibuster is a rules creation in 
the Senate which really has stopped

January 19, 2022 
many important pieces of legislation 
from being considered. It was really 
the major reason in the 1960s that the 
Voting Rights Act and other civil 
rights legislation took so long. I know 
personally five times I have brought to 
the floor the Dream Act to give young 
people in this country a chance for a 
path to citizenship, and five times on 
the floor of the Senate, it has been 
stopped by that same filibuster. 
We have heard lofty rhetoric from 
the Republican leader about what the 
filibuster means in the Senate. It has 
been used perhaps in constructive 
ways, but it has certainly been used 
time and again for a destructive pur-
pose. 
In the year since January 6, Repub-
lican legislatures in nearly 20 States 
have enacted laws making it harder for 
Americans to vote and, in some cases, 
easier for partisan actors to poten-
tially meddle and interfere with elec-
tions. 
In total, more than 440 bills with vot-
ing restrictions have been introduced 
in 49 States, and Senator MCCONNELL 
can’t see one example of voter suppres-
sion. 
Let me give you some examples so 
you know what we are speaking of. 
We have heard this from Senators 
WARNOCK and OSSOFF about the State 
of Georgia, a new law making it a 
crime to give a voter waiting in line to 
vote a snack or a drink of water—a 
crime to give a drink of water to some-
one waiting in line. 
As Senator BOOKER reminded us yes-
terday, these long lines many times are 
populated by members of minority pop-
ulations. What a coincidence that they 
are the ones with too few voting ma-
chines or polling places and have to 
wait many times for hours to exercise 
their franchise. 
In Texas, as a result of a new law 
known as S.B. 1, local election officials 
all over the State are reporting they 
are being forced to reject hundreds of 
absentee ballot requests for the State’s 
upcoming March primary. 
In Denton County, Texas officials 
have had to reject over 40 percent of 
absentee ballot requests. In Travis 
County, nearly a third of mail ballot 
applications have been rejected. Mak-
ing matters worse, this new law makes 
it a felony in Texas for an election offi-
cial in Texas to send an unsolicited 
mail ballot application to a voter. 
In 
Florida, 
Republican 
Governor 
DeSantis last week proposed creating a 
police unit that would be empowered to 
arrest voters and others who allegedly 
violate the State’s election laws. This 
is straight out of the Jim Crow play-
book. 
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 
at least 10 States have diminished sec-
retaries of states’ authorities over elec-
tions or shifted aspects of the adminis-
tration to partisan bodies, including 
State legislators themselves or elec-
tion boards dominated by the Repub-
lican Party. 
A new law in Arkansas now grants 
the State Board of Election Commis-
sioners—made of up five Republicans 
and one Democrat—police powers to in-
vestigate complaints about violation of 
the State’s election laws despite no 
evidence—none—of 
widespread 
voter 
fraud in the State. It empowers the 
board to upend the State’s traditional 
county-based election administration. 
A new law in Arizona specifies that 
Democratic secretary of state, Katie 
Hobbs, can no longer represent the 
State in lawsuits defending the elec-
tion code. That power now lies with the 
attorney general, who happens to be 
Republican—but only through January 
2, 2023, when Katie Hobbs’ term in of-
fice ends. 
Even more chilling, Republican law-
makers in a number of States have in-
troduced or passed new laws criminal-
izing aspects of election administra-
tion. 
In Wisconsin, the election adminis-
trators could face criminal penalties 
for correcting mistakes on a voter’s 
mail-in ballot. Voting rights experts 
fear that such laws could leave non-
partisan election administrators and 
workers forever looking over their 
shoulders or cause them to quit or be 
replaced by those who are less experi-
enced and more partisan. 
So why is this happening? As I men-
tioned earlier, the 2020 election had in-
credible turnout. According to the Cen-
sus Bureau, 67 percent of all eligible 
Americans reported voting, and the 
majority clearly voted for President 
Joe Biden. So now Republican law-
makers are using the Big Lie to pass 
partisan election laws in order to re-
duce voter turnout and control out-
comes of the elections this year and in 
2024. Their target? Democratic voters. 
And their goal? Sow the seeds of doubt 
in our democracy and the credibility of 
future elections. 
Republicans refuse to join us in pro-
tecting voting rights. Why? Because 
the agenda they are following was set 
by Donald Trump, and dissenters pay a 
price. If you don’t endorse—if you en-
dorse, rather, the Big Lie, he will en-
dorse you; if you don’t, he will unleash 
his fury. 
These attacks on voting rights are 
shaking the pillars of our democracy, 
the credibility of our elections, and the 
peaceful transfer of power. 
The vast majority of our Republican 
colleagues are all singing from the 
same hymnal. They say there is no new 
wave of voter suppression and election 
nullification laws. They are wrong. 
They claim that our proposals to re-
store the Voting Rights Act and set 
minimum Federal standards for elec-
tions amount to an ‘‘unprecedented 
takeover of State elections and a par-
tisan power grab.’’ They are wrong. 
Each of us in our desks has this com-
mon document that guides us, I hope, 
in all of our actions on the Senate 
floor. Despite statements to the con-
trary, we know that this document is 
explicit in what we are setting out to 
do today. 
The elections clause of the Constitu-
tion, article I, section 4, gives Congress 
the authority to make election laws. 
The 14th and 15th Amendments give 
Congress the responsibility to protect 
voting ‘‘by appropriate legislation.’’ 
The Voting Rights Act was reauthor-
ized and strengthened five times, al-
ways with a strong, bipartisan major-
ity. The last time it was reauthorized 
was 2006, 7 years before Shelby County. 
That decision of the Supreme Court, we 
know, gutted the law’s protections. 
The Senate voted unanimously, Demo-
crats and Republicans, to reauthorize 
and strengthen the law. Sixteen cur-
rent Republican Members of the Senate 
voted yes. It wasn’t a Federal takeover 
of elections then, it isn’t now, and they 
know it. 
I am the person chosen by Senate 
Democrats to count votes, and based 
on their public statements, two Demo-
crats may not vote to change the rules 
to allow this Congress to stop this 
power grab by Republican State law-
makers. These Senators have given 
their reasons. But there is something 
more important than an existing Sen-
ate rule—a rule that has been changed 
160 times in the history of this body. 
The integrity of our free elections, the 
right to have your vote counted, and 
our oath to uphold and defend the Con-
stitution I believe count for more. 
On January 6, after the insurrection 
was quelled, we returned to the Senate 
to complete our constitutional duty of 
certifying the election and declaring 
Joe Biden President. 
Speaking to the few Members of his 
party who still intended to challenge 
the electoral count on the feeble 
grounds that some of their constitu-
ents had doubts about the election, the 
junior Senator from Utah, Senator 
ROMNEY, said: ‘‘The best way you can 
show respect for the voters who are 
upset about this is to tell them the 
truth.’’ 
Then something happened on the 
floor of the Senate which rarely occurs: 
Senators on both sides of the aisle rose 
to their feet and gave Senator ROMNEY 
a standing ovation. Do you remember 
it? I do. 
It is time to remember that courage. 
It is time to tell the voters the truth. 
Stop repeating the Big Lie that is tear-
ing this country apart. It is time for 
the Senate to pass the Voting Rights 
Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. To 
restore the power of the Voting Rights 
Act is to restore the promise of Amer-
ica. 
I would like to close by reminding us 
that, earlier this week, we marked 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. I saw 
many tweets from Members of this 
Chamber celebrating his legacy. 
One 
Republican 
leader 
tweeted: 
‘‘Nearly 60 years since the March on 
Washington, Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr.’s message echoes as powerfully as it 
did that day. His legacy inspires us to 
celebrate and keep building upon the 
remarkable progress our great nation 
has made toward becoming a more per-
fect union.’’ 
Well, I certainly have good news for 
that Republican leader who sent that

tweet. He has an opportunity today to 
keep building on that remarkable 
progress. 
Instead of building on Dr. King’s 
work, we have watched Republicans 
and State legislatures across the coun-
try choose to tear down that remark-
able progress and make it harder to 
vote and make it harder to even ac-
knowledge and teach the brutal history 
of the civil rights movement and the 
systemic inequities that still exist. 
So here are the questions for Mem-
bers in this Chamber today: Are we 
going to live up today—this day, 
Wednesday—to the values we claimed 
on Monday, Martin Luther King Day? 
Are we going to be inspired to actually 
listen to the message of Dr. King and 
why he risked his life to deliver it? Are 
you going to keep building upon the 
legacy and progress that he fought to 
achieve? 
For all of us on both sides of the aisle 
who quoted Dr. King on Monday, I im-
plore you to listen to what he said in 
an interview in 1963 when asked about 
President Kennedy’s civil rights bill. 
He said: ‘‘I think the tragedy is that we 
have a Congress with a Senate that has 
a minority of misguided senators who 
will use the filibuster to keep a major-
ity of people from even voting. They 
won’t let the majority of senators vote. 
And certainly they wouldn’t want the 
majority of people to vote, because 
they know they do not represent the 
majority of the American people. In 
fact, they represent, in their own 
states, a very small minority.’’ 
Let’s listen to Dr. King. Let’s stop 
using the filibuster to kill legislation 
to protect Americans’ fundamental 
right to participate in our democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The Senator from South Da-
kota. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, later 
today, we expect the Democrat leader 
to force a vote on undermining the fili-
buster in hopes of forcing through a 
Federal election takeover to give his 
party an advantage in future elections. 
Make no mistake about it, that is what 
we 
are 
talking 
about—federalizing 
elections in this country; usurping, 
preempting States, where elections 
have been administered and regulated 
since the inception of this country. 
The method—the method—that you 
are talking about using to do it will 
literally undermine and blow up every-
thing the Senate was supposed to be. 
Now, you can say that the filibuster 
is used to prevent or block things from 
happening, and that may be true. You 
have done it. We have done it. Used a 
60-vote threshold last week to stop a 
bipartisan Russia sanctions bill from 
passing in the U.S. Senate. Both sides 
have done it. But the filibuster is rep-
resentative and symbolic of something 
much larger, and that is, the very es-
sence of what the Senate is about. 
I want to read for you from the Fed-
eralist Papers because there has been a 
lot of quoting of the Founding Fathers 
over here today. 
This is what the author of Federalist 
62 notes: 
[A] senate, as a second branch of the legis-
lative assembly, distinct from, and dividing 
power with, a first, must be in all cases a sal-
utary check on the government. It doubles 
the security to the people, by requiring the 
concurrence 
of 
two 
distinct 
bodies 
in 
schemes of usurpation or perfidy. . . . 
Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not 
less indicated by the propensity of all single 
and numerous assemblies to yield to the im-
pulse of sudden and violent passions, and to 
be seduced by factious leaders into intem-
perate and pernicious resolutions. 
To go on, the author of Federalist 62: 
[A] continual change even of good meas-
ures is inconsistent with every rule of pru-
dence and every prospect of success. 
In the first place, it forfeits the respect 
and confidence of other nations, and all the 
advantages connected with national char-
acter. 
The internal effects of a mutable policy 
are still more calamitous. It poisons the 
blessing of liberty itself. It will be of little 
avail to the people, that the laws are made 
by men of their own choice, if the laws be so 
voluminous that they cannot be read, or so 
incoherent that they cannot be understood; 
if they be repealed or revised before they are 
promulgated, or undergo such incessant 
changes that no man, who knows what the 
law is to-day, can guess what it will be to- 
morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of ac-
tion; but how can that be a rule, which is lit-
tle known, and less fixed? 
Ladies and gentlemen, our Founders 
created this institution to be separate 
and distinct from the House of Rep-
resentatives for a reason. And what 
you are talking about doing today is 
turning 
the 
U.S. 
Senate 
into 
a 
majoritarian body no different—no dif-
ferent—from the House of Representa-
tives except with longer terms and, 
some people would argue, bigger egos. 
That is what we are talking about 
doing. They won’t need us. Yes, we 
have longer terms; they are staggered. 
But the essence of the Senate is a 
check and balance on the passions of 
the other body, and there is a reason 
why the Founders created it. 
Now, I represent a red State, South 
Dakota. I am not a racist, nor are the 
people whom I know in the State of 
South Dakota. Our State legislature, 
like most States’ legislatures, pretty 
much every year comes up with ideas. 
Some of them—a few of them—not 
most, but a few get enacted into law. A 
lot of them end up on the cutting room 
floor, which is where most legislative 
ideas end up. And there are some crazy 
ones. 
I would argue we have some crazy 
ones coming out of here. There are 
some pretty crazy bills that get intro-
duced around here, most of which, 
gladly, never make it into law. 
But in South Dakota, our legislature 
meets every year, like most legisla-
tures, introduces a bunch of bills, acts 
on them, conducts hearings, and moves 
them through the legislative process. 
Some become enacted and signed into 
law; most don’t. One of the bills that 
did get signed into law was a bill that 
created a photo ID to vote. It was 
passed in 2003. It has worked well in 
South Dakota. People support it, not 
just in South Dakota but across the 
country. And after passing in 2003, the 
2004 election had the largest turnout in 
modern history, at least for the years 
for which we have that kind of infor-
mation available, as 78.6 percent of 
people voted in the 2004 election after— 
after—2003, when the South Dakota 
legislature passed a photo ID law. 
Now, I think there are some ideas out 
there that are pretty bad, and I am not 
one who is here to dispute the 2020 elec-
tion. The 2020 election is over. It has 
been decided. It was the largest turn-
out since 1900. It was the largest turn-
out in 120 years, which is why you all 
are arguing that these States are going 
in and changing things to prevent high 
turnout. Well, in most of the States 
that I have seen—at least that I can 
tell—the legislation that I have looked 
at that have been passed and enacted 
are things that in most cases people 
would say: Well, yeah, that is probably 
within the purview of the State legisla-
ture. 
The State of Georgia, for example, in 
terms of days in which you can early 
vote, actually has more early voting— 
more early voting, more permissive 
early voting—than the State of New 
York or the State of Delaware, the 
President’s home State. There is no-ex-
cuse absentee voting. We have that in 
South Dakota. We have a long period 
for absentee voting or early voting in 
South Dakota, much longer than what 
we are talking about here. In a red 
State, the State legislature decided 
that, thought it made sense. But no-ex-
cuse absentee voting is something that 
we do in South Dakota, something that 
is allowed for in Georgia but is not in 
the State of New York or the State of 
Delaware, because the States decide it, 
as it should be. 
About standing in line and giving 
people things while they are standing 
in line to vote, the State of South Da-
kota has a law against that, too. It is 
called electioneering. It is called elec-
tioneering. Now, there isn’t anything 
that I understand of Georgia law that 
doesn’t prevent an election worker 
from going out and giving somebody a 
glass of water or something to eat. 
There isn’t anything that says that 150 
feet away—which is 50 yards—50 yards 
away, you can’t feed people lunch. All 
it says is, when somebody is standing 
in 
line, 
that 
political 
operatives 
shouldn’t be electioneering, going out 
and handing things out to induce peo-
ple to vote a certain way. 
Ladies and gentlemen, don’t blow up 
the U.S. Senate and everything that 
the Founders intended the Senate to be 
about over an issue that, for all intents 
and purposes—and you can say it is 
not—but it is federalizing our elec-
tions. It is taking power away from 
States to make the laws that govern 
our elections. 
And thank God in 2020 the States did 
things the right way. The States cer-
tified on time, in accordance with the 
law, the 2020 election. And if we hadn’t

had that, if we had sucked all that 
power up here to Washington, DC, and 
centralized our elections, what do you 
think would have happened? 
I mean, I think there is a reason why 
we have a decentralized system, and I 
think it makes sense for a country as 
big as ours, particularly at a time 
when we are worrying about other 
countries hacking our elections. It is a 
lot harder to hack 50 States than it is 
one computer system here in Wash-
ington, DC. But that is what we are 
talking about, and you can’t sugar coat 
it. You can disguise it and you can say 
it is Jim Crow 2.0 and all that, but it is 
federalizing elections in this country 
and taking power directly away from 
the States. 
I lost my first Senate election back 
in 2002. I was ahead on Wednesday 
morning. Tuesday night and Wednes-
day came and went. On Wednesday 
morning, I was sitting in my living 
room in Sioux Falls, SD, watching the 
television, and I watched my 3,300 vote 
lead become a 524 vote deficit, like that 
because one precinct came in from one 
of the Reservation counties in South 
Dakota, and they voted 94 percent—93 
percent—against me, and I lost that 
election. And I had all these people, all 
of these smart political minds around 
the country and in South Dakota, say: 
You have to contest it. There are irreg-
ularities. You know there are irreg-
ularities. 
I thought about it, and we did a little 
bit of looking into it, but, a day later, 
I decided to say the election was over. 
I lost that first election. And you know 
what, that is what happens. Sometimes 
we win; sometimes we lose. 
What you all are trying to do here is 
create a system, it seems to me, at 
least, where you give your side a per-
manent advantage. And I don’t—I 
mean, that is your prerogative. If you 
want to do this, that is fine in terms of 
having the issue and talking about it. 
But the one thing I just fundamentally 
disagree with is how you are proposing 
to do it—to literally do away with ev-
erything the Senate was designed and 
created to be by our Founders and has 
served a purpose very, very well, and 
you all did it the last session of Con-
gress. 
You 
filibustered 
numerous 
coronavirus bills. You filibustered po-
lice reform. You filibustered pro-life 
legislation, and then go down the list. 
And like I said, you used the 60-vote 
threshold last week to keep a Russia 
sanctions 
bill—a 
bipartisan 
Russia 
sanctions bill, I might add—from pass-
ing the Senate. 
And you can go on and look at all the 
statements you have all made through 
the years, and I am not going to repeat 
them, because you heard them over and 
over again. But I think it is important 
to remember one thing, and that is, 
when you make statements like that, 
they do have a shelf life. And some of 
that shelf life is pretty short, because 
it was just a few years ago, in some 
cases 3, 4 years ago; in some cases, 1 
year ago, 2 years ago. 
A lot of you have statements pub-
licly, clearly out there, defending the 
filibuster: Doing away with it would be 
doomsday for democracy; turn America 
into a banana republic. 
Don’t do it. I am just saying, don’t do 
it. There has got to be somebody over 
there who gets this. I mean, we had the 
pressure to do this. You know that. 
Thirty-four times, our President in the 
last administration—34 times—tweeted 
publicly, demanded that Republicans 
get rid of the filibuster, and we resisted 
it. And I have had people in the media 
ask me. And I have heard that your 
side is saying, too: Well, the Demo-
crats, you know, if we don’t do it now, 
Republicans will do it. 
No, we are not going to do it—not if 
you don’t. If you do, then sure, then all 
bets are off. And then the Senate be-
comes the House of Representatives 
and policy changes every 2 years or 4 
years, depending on who is in power. 
There is no stability. There is no pre-
dictability. There is no moderation, 
and there is no incentive for this body 
to work together across the aisle. That 
changes permanently. 
I hope that doesn’t happen because I 
don’t think that is what we should be 
about—certainly not what we should be 
about. But that is where this is headed 
if—if—if you move forward, if you 
change the rules, overthrow the rules 
to do this. 
Mr. President, we are better than 
this. Our country is better than this. 
Our Founders created a system that 
was designed to provide that modera-
tion, provide that continuity, to pro-
vide that stability, to provide that pre-
dictability in a way that what is being 
talked about today would completely 
destroy and undermine, not only in the 
near term but permanently—because 
you can’t do this once. You can’t turn 
this off. You can’t put the genie back 
in the bottle. Once you do this, it is a 
new state of play in the U.S. Senate, 
and that is a whole new world, not just 
for us but for the people we represent, 
for our Nation and for the world. 
I hope and pray that there are 
enough wise Democrats on your side 
that will join with all of us to resist 
the pressure that you are feeling, like 
we did when our President came to us 
and said you have to do this. We aren’t 
going to do it because we understand 
what it means, and you should too. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
am here on this momentous day for our 
country, and I would like to address 
some of the remarks from my friend 
and neighbor from the State of South 
Dakota. I hope he will stay for my re-
marks. 
What is the Senate about? That is 
what Senator THUNE was just address-
ing. What is the Senate about? We 
come here to represent the people of 
our States, and we come here to make 
decisions and to vote. I don’t think 
anyone in our States wants us to come 
here and hug an archaic tradition and 
then simply stop votes, stop debates; 
hug that tradition tight and then 
throw the voters under the desk and go 
home and raise money; because, basi-
cally, that is what this tradition has 
turned into. 
I believe what our Founding Fathers 
wanted when it became clear that this 
country was forming, they wanted to 
have a Senate that worked. And when 
you go back and look, there is no men-
tion about filibuster in the Constitu-
tion. There is no mention of 60 votes. 
There is no mention of cloture. Rules 
developed over time. And believe it or 
not, to my friend from South Dakota, 
those rules changed with the times. In 
the words of Senator Byrd, someone 
who believed in the traditions of this 
place, the rules change with the cir-
cumstances. And in the words of our 
Constitution, which the Senator from 
South Dakota failed to mention, ‘‘The 
Times, Places and Manner of . . . Elec-
tions’’—well, this is what it says: ‘‘Con-
gress may at any time by Law make or 
alter such Regulations.’’ 
That is what it says. It was very, 
very clear, at the beginning of this 
country, that it was anticipated that 
the Congress would have a role in these 
elections. Why? Because they are Fed-
eral elections. 
And now before us—before us—is the 
freedom to vote, something that has 
been a long and hard fought battle in 
our country’s history. And today we 
continue that march toward justice in 
the Senate because we face a coordi-
nated and relentless campaign to limit 
Americans’ 
constitutional 
right 
to 
vote. 
As President Biden said last week—I 
was honored to be there with him and 
Vice President HARRIS in Atlanta. As 
he said, ‘‘This is the test of our time.’’ 
There are moments in the life of our 
Nation, like when a bomb blew up the 
16th Street Baptist Church in Bir-
mingham and four little girls were 
murdered; like when John Lewis and so 
many others were bloodied as they 
crossed that bridge in Selma—there are 
moments in time when things stand 
still. 
And make no mistake, our country is 
at one of those moments right now. It 
is no coincidence that after more 
Americans voted than in the history of 
this country in the 2020 election, that 
suddenly there was a slew—a flood—of 
State election laws meant to suppress 
the votes of Americans. 
It is not, as the minority leader just 
described, a fake panic. A fake panic? 
Let’s see what is fake about this. What 
is fake about this law that passed in 
Georgia, where, suddenly, when 70,000 
people registered to vote during the 
runoff period—I would say to the mi-
nority leader if he were here, when 
70,000 people registered to vote during 
the runoff period—they changed that 
law. They reduced the time of the run-
off period. They make it so no one can 
register during that time. In Montana, 
8,000 
people 
availed 
themselves 
of

same-day registration in the last elec-
tion by either changing their address 
because they moved or registering for 
the first time. What did they do? That 
is it. That is not going to happen, even 
though it has been in place for 15 years, 
long before the pandemic. 
That is not fake. There is nothing 
about that that is fake. 
And when I think about the moment 
in time we are in now, I look back to 
that moment when Senator BLUNT and 
I and Vice President Pence—the last 
ones remaining in this Chamber, with 
two young women holding the mahog-
any box with the last of the electoral 
ballots through W, Wyoming. At 3:30 in 
the morning, as we took that long walk 
over to the House of Representatives— 
that walk that had been so joyful just 
that morning. That glass, broken on 
the sides of that wall, that was not 
fake. The statues covered in spray 
paint, that was not fake. That was 
real—just as real as the fact that over 
440 bills, since that fateful day, have 
been introduced to restrict voting, and 
30 of these bills have been signed into 
law in 19 States. What is happening in 
States 
like 
Florida, 
Georgia, 
and 
Texas, with their omnibus bills, that is 
very real. 
The voters—they know it is real. 
Last summer, when we took the Rules 
Committee on a field hearing—joined 
by Senator OSSOFF, who is a member of 
the committee, and Senator Reverend 
WARNOCK, who has taken on this torch 
in his State and across the country—we 
met a veteran, living in central Geor-
gia. He told us how he took his older 
neighbors to vote early, but they had 
to give up and go home after seeing the 
line wrapped around the block, and 
when he later went back to vote, he 
had to wait, himself, for 3 hours in the 
hot Sun. 
That is not fake, I say to the minor-
ity leader. That is real. 
This guy is a veteran. He served in 
the Air Force during Operation Desert 
Storm. When I asked him if he had to 
wait in line when he signed up to serve, 
he said no. But when he came home 
and wanted to vote in an election in 
the United States of America, he had 
to wait in the hot Sun hour after hour, 
after hour. 
When the minority leader said that 
no American deserved to have his voice 
silenced, as he just said in this Cham-
ber—those long lines, one ballot box in 
the middle of Harris County, TX, with 
over 5 million people, which would be 
like putting one ballot box in the mid-
dle of my entire State—then what are 
those laws about? Silencing people. 
That is what it is about. 
When we were in Atlanta, we also 
heard from Helen Butler, a former elec-
tions official for a rural county, who 
told us how she was ousted by the Re-
publicans in the State legislature after 
over a decade of service, which the new 
law makes even easier to do by strip-
ping power away from local officials 
and, ultimately, putting it in the hands 
of the State legislature. They are mess-
ing around, my friends, with the very 
counting of the votes, with proposals 
made in Wisconsin, with proposals 
made in other States. 
One Montana woman, living on the 
Blackfeet Indian Reservation, had open 
heart surgery a week before the 2020 
election and relied on a Tribal assist-
ance provider to return her ballot, but 
under another new law, the assistance 
she received is now banned. These are 
real, and these are real people. 
It is voters who were made to stand 
in the rain, in homemade masks and 
garbage bags, at the beginning of the 
pandemic, just to exercise their right 
to vote. It is veterans standing in hot 
lines in the Sun in Georgia. It is a 
voter in a wheelchair in Texas being 
forced to travel 3 hours and take 4 
buses roundtrip to reach a ballot drop- 
off box. It is a voter in Arizona being 
told that she didn’t receive her mail-in 
ballot for the State’s primary because 
she had been marked as an inactive 
voter even though she had just cast her 
ballot in the Presidential primary. 
It is five States—Indiana, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas—still 
telling over 30 million—30 million— 
Americans, registered voters, that they 
cannot request a mail-in ballot during 
a pandemic without an approved ex-
cuse. That is why it is on us, with the 
support of the Constitution, to take ac-
tion. As I noted at the beginning of my 
remarks, it was, in fact, anticipated in 
the Constitution with that clause that 
empowers Congress to make or alter 
rules for Federal elections. 
What does the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act do? 
It sets basic Federal standards to en-
sure that Americans can participate in 
the franchise. It guarantees at least 2 
weeks of early voting, like voters now 
have in two-thirds of States, including 
red States. It provides for same-day 
registration, like they had for 15 years 
in Montana. It allows all voters to re-
quest a mail-in ballot, without an ex-
cuse, and ensures voters do not need to 
provide 
witness 
signatures 
or 
notarizations of notary publics, whom 
they would have to hire, on mail-in 
ballots because, if you are in South 
Carolina right now and you want to 
cast a mail-in ballot and you have 
COVID or you are in a hospital, you 
have to have a witness sign off on that 
ballot. It also makes your voters have 
access to drop boxes. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act would also include much needed 
protections against those seeking to 
undermine 
our 
elections. 
Senator 
BLUNT and I held a bipartisan hearing 
this last year, and we found out that 
nearly one in three local elections offi-
cials feels unsafe because of the job, 
and nearly one in six has received 
threats of violence. 
The Republican Kentucky secretary 
of state said that, if something doesn’t 
happen, they are not going to have 
enough people to work at elections. 
Now, he didn’t agree with what we were 
going to do, but he did note that they 
no longer have enough volunteers to 
work their polls. 
A Republican Philadelphia city com-
missioner who did want to see legisla-
tion passed, Al Schmidt, told us about 
the threats—he is no longer in his job— 
he received as a result of his work of 
simply counting the ballots. He told 
us—I see the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania here—that his family’s names, 
his kids’ names have been put out on 
the internet as well as his address, a 
picture of his house, and a message, 
saying: Tell the truth or your three 
kids will be fatally shot. 
Arizona Secretary of State Katie 
Hobbs told us she received a message: I 
am a hunter, and I think you should be 
hunted. 
These are not just 1-point examples. 
Over 9,000 Members of Congress have 
received threats—double, triple. This is 
according to the Capitol Police, in 
numbers that we have never seen be-
fore. 
So, no, I say to the minority leader. 
This is not fake. This is not one big 
fake. It calls for Federal action. Yes, I 
am disappointed that four times our 
colleagues have voted down allowing us 
to go forward with the Freedom to 
Vote Act or the John Lewis bill, which 
are now combined into one. With the 
exception of Senator MURKOWSKI, who 
did allow for the debate to continue on 
one of the bills, the John Lewis bill, no 
one stood up and joined us in allowing 
for a debate on these bills—no one. So 
that is why we are here. 
I say to Senator THUNE: The reason 
we are looking to restore the rules of 
the Senate is that there is no other 
way to move forward to guarantee 
Americans the right to vote. In the 
past, this was bipartisan. In 2006, the 
Voting Rights Act was reauthorized 
under President George W. Bush by a 
vote of 98 to 0—98 to 0—but that is, 
sadly, not where we are today. 
When it comes to the rules of the 
Senate—and I am not going to belabor 
this, as I see my friend Senator 
MERKLEY of Oregon, who is a historical 
expert on all of this—I will say this: 
There are 160 exceptions—160 excep-
tions—to the filibuster rule. Things 
have been changed to benefit my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. 
Somehow, it only took 51 votes to put 
in place the Trump tax cuts or the 
Bush tax cuts. Somehow, it only took 
51 votes to put Amy Coney Barrett on 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States—a change by them, made by 
them. Somehow, it only takes 51 votes 
to try to overturn a regulation or to 
try to mess around with the Affordable 
Care Act. 
But then, when it comes to some-
thing like voting rights, suddenly, ev-
eryone on the other side of the aisle is 
hugging that filibuster tight, knowing 
that, in so many times in history, in-
cluding most recently with the debt 
ceiling, changes have been made to 
allow a vote with less than 60 votes: 
the National Gas Policy Act in 1977; in 
1995, the Endangered Species Act; in

1996, a change to the reconciliation 
process—160 times. 
And, 
as 
Representative 
CLYBURN 
pointed out so well, there have been 
times in our history when that most 
sacrosanct of rights has been extended 
or defended—the right to vote—on a bi-
partisan basis, like with the 15th 
Amendment. But we know, as he said, 
that that was a single-party vote that 
gave Black people the right to vote, 
and that fact does not make the 15th 
Amendment any less legitimate. 
During the past week, so many in 
this Chamber celebrated the life of 
Martin Luther King, but let us not for-
get what he stood for. He did not stand 
for the filibuster. He didn’t like it. As 
Reverend WARNOCK has pointed out so 
many times, he stood for action and 
fairness and freedom. 
Last week, I met with Martin Luther 
King III and his wife and daughter, who 
came to Washington to help us pass 
this legislation. They told me that 
their daughter was born in 2008, the 
year that President Obama was elect-
ed. They told me how the Supreme 
Court’s Shelby County decision was 
issued 5 years later, followed by Geor-
gia’s anti-voting law, enacted just last 
year. How sad is it that, if we do not 
act, their daughter—the granddaughter 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.—and her 
classmates will face more obstacles in 
voting, in casting a ballot, than the 
promise that they were born with? This 
cannot be the democracy that our chil-
dren inherit. 
Dr. King once said—and I will para-
phrase—that disappointment is finite. I 
don’t know how today is going to end, 
but if it ends without this bill’s pass-
ing, we will be much less of a country 
moving forward. Yet I will keep this in 
mind, what he said: Disappointment is 
finite, but hope is infinite. 
The people of this country will not 
tolerate, as the minority leader has 
said, the silencing of their voices. 
Truly, I think, by voting this down, by 
not allowing us to even debate this to 
get to the conclusion of a vote, that 
this is silencing the people of Amer-
ica—all in the name of an archaic Sen-
ate rule that isn’t even in the Constitu-
tion. That is just wrong. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, just 14 
months ago, our Nation stood on the 
brink of a constitutional crisis as the 
former President and his followers at-
tempted to disrupt the peaceful trans-
fer of power and overturn the results of 
a free and fair election. 
Instead of accepting the will of the 
voters in upholding the foundations of 
our constitutional Republic, President 
Trump and his followers engaged in a 
campaign of blatant disinformation 
and political interference. They at-
tempted to coerce State and local elec-
tion officials to make false claims of 
widespread fraud and then use those 
claims to not certify election results 
and reject the will of the people—all to 
ensure that the former President could 
stay in power at any cost. 
My home State of Michigan was at 
the very center of this battle in 2020 
when our State Board of Canvassers 
met to certify the undeniable fact that 
Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS had won 
the State of Michigan and its 16 elec-
toral votes, but we came dangerously 
close to the kind of anti-democratic 
and authoritarian behavior that the 
United States has long decried in other 
nations. 
It basically came down to one vote— 
just one vote—from one Republican 
member of the Board of Canvassers— 
one canvasser who dared to withstand 
the intense political pressure for him 
to ignore the will of the people and to 
not certify those election results, one 
canvasser who chose to ignore blatant 
lies and disinformation. His one vote 
was all that stood between a secure, 
free, and fair election and a constitu-
tional crisis. This one Republican 
board member knew his decision to fol-
low the law would cost him the posi-
tion on that board. He knew that his 
physical safety would be threatened, 
and it was. Yet he stood his ground. He 
fulfilled his constitutional duty and 
followed the will of the people of the 
State of Michigan by voting to certify 
those results. 
So what was his reward for his coura-
geous vote? Well, the Republicans re-
moved him from the board, sending a 
very clear message and a threat to all 
of those who will follow him. 
Despite failing to coerce enough offi-
cials to ignore the law and falsify elec-
tion results and despite losing one 
bogus challenge after another in the 
Federal courts, we all know that the 
former President didn’t stop his efforts 
there—no. Instead, he rallied his sup-
porters and incited them to attack the 
U.S. Capitol Building—the very citadel 
of our democracy—to disrupt Congress 
as we conducted the ceremonial certifi-
cation of the results. But thanks to the 
brave actions of law enforcement offi-
cers, the National Guard, and so many 
others, our democracy withstood these 
unprecedented attacks on our constitu-
tional Republic. 
This attack shook the very founda-
tion of our democracy. It exposed 
cracks that show that it is more fragile 
than we ever thought was possible. 
Despite all of this, I believe that we 
need to celebrate the fact that the 2020 
Presidential election was secure, ac-
cording to the Department of Home-
land Security and the FBI. We should 
celebrate that we had record turnout 
even in a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. 
We should commend the election work-
ers who made this incredible feat pos-
sible. Instead, too many people, includ-
ing too many of my Republican col-
leagues, have continued to sow doubt 
in the integrity of our election process, 
and these actions threaten the very 
bedrock of our democracy. 
Instead of condemning falsehoods and 
violence, there is a concerted effort un-
derway in Michigan and all across our 
country to rewrite history, remove 
election officials, and rewrite State 
laws to limit voter participation. 
One of the bills that were introduced 
in the Michigan Legislature would lock 
up—would 
lock 
up—absentee 
drop 
boxes before election day. One Repub-
lican city clerk called this idea crazy 
and said it makes no sense whatsoever. 
I agree. Another bill would restrict the 
ability of State election officials to 
send out absentee ballot applications 
to voters. In fact, Michigan Repub-
licans filed 39 bills in the State legisla-
ture to restrict voting rights. 
Nothing less than the very future of 
our democracy is at stake, and we 
must act or risk losing what so many 
Americans have fought for and have 
died for for nearly 250 years. The right 
to vote, the right to self-governance, 
the right of the American people to 
choose and fire public officials is our 
Nation’s fundamental freedom. We can 
protect that right and ensure every 
American has equal access to the bal-
lot box, and we can do it by simply 
passing two bills that are before us. 
The Freedom to Vote Act will pro-
tect the rights of voters by facilitating 
registration, early voting, and vote-by- 
mail. It will set a standard to ensure 
that every citizen in every State has 
guaranteed rights. The John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act takes 
additional steps to address the prac-
tices that have historically been used 
to discriminate against voters simply 
based on their race. 
Despite some of the Republican argu-
ments that I have already heard today, 
the Constitution is very clear. We have 
heard that from article I of the Con-
stitution, and many times, Congress 
has continued to strengthen the voting 
rights of individuals. 
The 15th Amendment clearly states 
that the right of citizens cannot be 
abridged by a State and clearly states 
that ‘‘Congress shall have the power to 
enforce this article by appropriate leg-
islation.’’ That is just what Congress 
has done in passing the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965, the Help America Vote Act, 
and the National Voter Registration 
Act. Congress has done this in the past. 
We need to do it again. 
The American people overwhelm-
ingly 
support 
these 
commonsense 
measures, and they deserve to know 
where we stand. For that reason, after 
every Senator has had a chance to 
speak, the debate must come to an end, 
and we must have an up-or-down vote 
on these bills. 
I believe history will not be kind to 
the colleagues of mine who stand in the 
way of democracy. 
Make no mistake about it, we are at 
a pivotal moment in our Nation’s his-
tory. Our democratic Republic and our 
most treasured values are in danger. If 
we fail to act, we may lose it. 
I proudly stand on the side of democ-
racy, and I urge my colleagues to stand 
with me in passing the Freedom to 
Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S286 
January 19, 2022 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, families 
in Texas and across the country are 
being pummeled by the highest infla-
tion in 40 years. For everything from 
gasoline to groceries, to clothing, to 
utility bills, basic expenses have sky-
rocketed. 
Groceries just don’t cost more, they 
are also harder to find. Empty shelves 
have become a sign of the times as sup-
ply chain problems, staffing shortages, 
and severe weather have created a per-
fect storm. 
On top of that, families are trying to 
stay safe and healthy in the midst of a 
surge in COVID–19 cases. There is an 
urgent need for testing and masks, 
both of which are increasingly hard to 
come by. 
With so many urgent needs facing 
families in Texas and elsewhere, what 
does the Democratic leadership have 
teed up for the Senate this week? A 
partisan bill to take over the Nation’s 
elections. Democrats apparently want 
people to forget about the fact that 
they can’t keep their refrigerators or 
pantries stocked or that their kids are 
out of school again because of the pan-
demic and can’t study in person or that 
it costs a small fortune to fill up your 
gas tank. Apparently, they are trying 
to convince the American people that 
there is somehow a coordinated assault 
on the right to vote and their partisan 
legislation is the only savior. 
According to our colleagues, the evi-
dence of this attack can be found in a 
number of State laws passed this last 
year, even though many of the reforms 
in those laws make voting easier than 
in a number of blue States. The Geor-
gia law, for example, extends the early 
voting period to 17 days, giving voters 
more time than what is offered in the 
President’s home State of Delaware, 
which, until this year, did not allow 
any in-person early voting. 
When that argument fails, though, 
our colleagues say the need for this 
legislation stems from the attack on 
the Capitol on January 6, even though 
their bill was written long before a 
mob descended on this building. In 
fact, the first version of the For the 
People Act was introduced in 2019, 
more than 3 years ago. 
The so-called voting rights crisis is 
nothing 
more 
than 
manufactured 
hysteria to justify our colleagues’ long-
standing attempts to take over Amer-
ica’s elections. 
Just to put a timeframe around the 
concerns, this is what 94 percent of re-
spondents to a Pew poll, a nonpartisan 
poll, said about the 2020 elections. 
Ninety-four percent said it was easy or 
very easy to cast their ballot. Yet the 
legislation that is going to be consid-
ered today has its origins in a 2019 bill 
called the For the People Act, which 
obviously predates this poll from the 
Pew corporation. 
While I have no doubt the Senate will 
reject this legislation once again, I 
never cease to be amazed at how far 
our colleagues are willing to go to en-
hance their own political power purely 
along partisan lines. As a matter of 
fact, they have done a complete about- 
face. 
Less than 5 years ago, the majority 
leader said we should ‘‘build a firewall 
around the legislative filibuster.’’ He 
has now laid the groundwork and will 
call the vote to end it. The Democratic 
leader has tried to frame this radical 
move as a way to promote debate, but 
make no mistake, our colleagues aren’t 
trying to blow up the Senate to force 
Republicans to explain our opposition 
to the election takeover bill. In fact, 
we have done that endlessly. We don’t 
need this drama in order to explain our 
position. I, for one, have spent hours on 
the Senate floor explaining the dangers 
of this partisan legislation, as have 
many of my other colleagues. 
The only conclusion I can reach is 
that our Democratic colleagues are 
trying to blow up the Senate in order 
to clear a path for purely partisan leg-
islation, to take a body that was actu-
ally created to promote bipartisan con-
sensus building and make it possible 
with purely Democrat votes to work 
their will in a body that represents 
some 330 million Americans. What a 
bad idea that would be, to promote 
purely partisan legislation and dis-
suade or take away the incentives that 
encourage us to do what doesn’t come 
naturally, and that is to actually work 
together and build consensus. 
Our colleagues apparently don’t real-
ize how shortsighted this move actu-
ally is. In the Senate, the door actually 
swings both ways. One day, you are in 
a majority. The next day, you are 
using every tool at your disposal to 
have a say in the process while rep-
resenting your constituents. 
No matter how much frustration and 
heartache the filibuster creates for the 
majority party, the shoe is always ca-
pable of being on the other foot. Those 
of us who have been here a while have 
been in the majority and in the minor-
ity and understand the frustration that 
a majority feels when they can’t get 
what they want while complying with 
the Senate rules and the consensus- 
building requirement of the 60-vote clo-
ture vote requirement. 
But if our colleagues succeed in blow-
ing up the filibuster, there is no ques-
tion that it will be easier for them to 
turn their progressive wish list into 
the law of the land. 
You can’t just carve out one piece of 
legislation. Once we head down that 
slippery slope, the legislative filibuster 
is gone. 
Taking over America’s elections may 
be the first item on their agenda, but it 
won’t be the last. They could pass the 
Green New Deal 2.0, impose sweeping 
gun control laws, legalize abortion 
from the time of conception until the 
time of natural delivery, and force 
every individual in the country into a 
one-size-fits-all healthcare plan. They 
could expand the Supreme Court and 
pack it with partisan Justices. They 
could even add new States—Puerto 
Rico, Washington, DC—and add to 
their majority in the Senate while 
doing so. 
There would be no limit, no con-
straint, not even a speed bump on what 
our Democratic colleagues could do if 
they created so-called carve-outs for 
every bill they dub ‘‘must-pass legisla-
tion.’’ The entirety of the radical left’s 
wish list could become law without 
having to gain a single Republican 
vote. 
Of course, there is one big caveat 
here: Our Democratic colleagues can 
only do that if they retain the major-
ity. As our colleagues know, power is 
fleeting, and at some point, the shoe 
will always be on the other foot. The 
sign on Senator SCHUMER’s door may 
say ‘‘majority leader’’ today, but that 
won’t last forever. In a year, Repub-
licans could hold the majority in both 
the Senate and the House. Three years 
from today, we could have a Repub-
lican President-elect. I would like to 
ask my colleagues, what happens then? 
When Republicans control the Senate, 
the House, and the White House, as 
Democrats do now, how would our col-
leagues feel about the new rule book 
that they have created? Will they 
stand by their decision to silence the 
minority and ignore the millions of the 
people those Senators represent? Not a 
chance. If the filibuster is eliminated, 
it doesn’t just pave the way to our 
Democratic 
colleagues’ 
agenda; 
it 
clears the path for the majority’s agen-
da, whichever party that may be. 
Now, liberal activists may like the 
idea of nuking the filibuster today, but 
they will soon find themselves ruing 
the day their party broke the Senate. 
The next Republican-controlled Senate 
could make the 2017 tax cuts perma-
nent and ensure that blue-State mil-
lionaires are required to pay their fair 
share of Federal taxes. 
We could make sure that there would 
be investments in border security and 
immigration enforcement and craft re-
forms to reduce the immigration court 
backlog. We could withhold Federal 
funding from sanctuary cities and 
prioritize the deportation of violent 
criminals. 
We could implement a 20-week ban on 
abortions and ensure that any baby 
who survives an abortion receives life-
saving care. We could expand school 
choice to give students and parents 
more options when it comes to a qual-
ity education. We could protect our 
constituents’ 
Second 
Amendment 
rights and establish concealed carry 
reciprocity throughout the Nation. 
We could pass right-to-work laws, ex-
pand natural gas production, and make 
even more investments in our national 
security. 
In short, a future Republican-con-
trolled Senate would be able to accom-
plish a lot, all thanks to a precedent 
that our Democratic colleagues seek to 
establish today. And while I would love 
to see many of these bills that I just

mentioned become law, I oppose any ef-
fort to eliminate or weaken the legisla-
tive filibuster, just as we did when we 
were in the majority working with a 
Republican President during the pre-
ceding 4 years. 
There is no scenario in which par-
tisan wins are more important than 
long-term stability for our laws and 
our public policy. It is not just the 
American people who would experience 
whiplash under this game of ping-pong. 
Imagine the chaos our economy would 
endure if laws were simply changed 
every couple of years because a new 
majority comes into place. 
Without some degree of predict-
ability, how could businesses, small 
and large alike, make investments that 
would pay off in the future and create 
more jobs and help grow our economy? 
This is why we need the filibuster for 
every piece of legislation that comes 
out of the Senate. The much derided 60- 
vote threshold is there to ensure the 
stability of our country’s laws and 
policies are not affected by the transi-
tory majorities that we find here in 
Congress. 
I know the Democratic leader and 
many of our colleagues are moved to 
action by their political base, and some 
may actually be worried about having 
a primary opponent unless they go to 
the mat trying to eliminate the fili-
buster. Well, some of our colleagues 
have experienced unbelievable pres-
sure, particularly the Senator from 
West Virginia and the Senator from 
Arizona. And last night, if the press re-
ports are accurate, when asked wheth-
er the majority leader would support a 
contested primary run against Senator 
MANCHIN and Senator SINEMA, he didn’t 
respond. The Senator from Vermont, 
Senator SANDERS, did respond and said 
he would consider supporting a pri-
mary opponent to the Senator from 
West Virginia and the Senator from 
Arizona. I would make the point that it 
was the junior Senator from Vermont 
who made that statement, not the Pre-
siding Officer. 
So, in the Democratic Party, if you 
can’t vote your conscience anymore, 
you either have to fall in line or your 
colleagues will make every effort to 
try to kick you out. 
Well, I have some news for our 
friends across the aisle. If they think 
liberal activists are upset now, they 
haven’t seen anything yet because, if 
the majority leader successfully blows 
up the rules of the Senate, the radical 
left will have a full-on meltdown when 
Republicans regain the majority, which 
could be as soon as next year. 
Regardless of which party holds the 
majority, the Senate rules should not 
be bent or broken to achieve strictly 
partisan wins. Democrats’ attempt to 
blow up the Senate is reckless and em-
barrassingly shortsighted. You wonder 
if anybody learned anything out of the 
debates and the nuclear option that 
was used strictly for judicial nomina-
tions, which resulted in three Repub-
lican nominees being confirmed to the 
Supreme Court during the last Presi-
dent’s term of office. 
Later today, all 100 Senators will go 
on the record. Each Member will vote 
on whether to silence 50 Senators and 
the tens of millions of people that 
those of us in the majority represent. 
All of my Republican colleagues sup-
port the filibuster, even when we have 
received a lot of pressure—like the 
Senator from Arizona and the Senator 
from West Virginia have had—from 
people in their own political party, in-
cluding the President of the United 
States, because we have stood in favor 
of that requirement because of the sta-
bilizing force that it provides and, 
again, forcing us to do something that 
doesn’t necessarily come natural, and 
that is to work together and build bi-
partisan consensus. 
Don’t get me wrong. It is hard, in 
this polarized country, to work to-
gether and find common ground, but it 
is essential that we continue to do so 
where we can. Our Democratic col-
leagues used to agree. In fact, it has 
been less than 5 years since 27 of our 
current Democratic colleagues signed a 
letter 
arguing 
that 
the 
filibuster 
should be preserved. We will see if 
those colleagues and the many others 
who have defended the filibuster end up 
caving to the radical left in their polit-
ical base and vote to blow up the Sen-
ate. 
For the sake of the American people, 
our economy, and the long-term sta-
bility of our government, I hope this 
ends up being another failed vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am so 
glad to be with my colleagues on the 
floor on this most important day dis-
cussing a most important topic, and I 
want to say particularly that I am glad 
to follow my friend from Texas. The 
senior Senator from Texas is a friend. 
We have traveled together. We have 
legislated together. But friends can dis-
agree, and on this topic we disagree 
strongly. 
Life throws ironies at us. The Sen-
ator from Texas inhabits the seat that 
was held by Lyndon Baines Johnson— 
Lyndon Baines Johnson—the towering 
figure who helped usher through the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. I inhabit a 
seat that for years was called the Byrd 
seat in the Senate, inhabited for 50 
years by Harry Byrd, Sr., and Harry 
Byrd, Jr., who were known for their 
virulent efforts to deprive African 
Americans of civil rights, including 
frequent extended filibusters on this 
floor against voting rights. 
LBJ is held in high regard today be-
cause of his passion for voting rights. 
Harry Byrd—I was at the State cap-
itol in Richmond on Saturday to see 
our new Governor inaugurated, and I 
walked by the spot on the capitol 
grounds where a Harry Byrd statue 
used to stand. It was removed 6 months 
ago. The Harry Byrd Middle School in 
Henrico County was renamed 5 years 
ago to the Quioccasin Middle School. 
The Harry Byrd, Jr. School of Busi-
ness at the Shenandoah University in 
Winchester, their hometown, had that 
name stripped off the building a few 
years ago. 
And I stand to follow the Senator 
who holds LBJ’s seat—the Senator 
from the Byrd seat—to today argue 
that the time has come for us to pro-
tect voting rights. 
I am just happy to be on the floor 
talking about a bill. I mean, for gosh 
sake, we have been able to talk about 
voting rights in the morning hour. Mr. 
Leader, I have been here since January 
of 2013. This is the first time since then 
that we have been able to get a bill on 
the floor to talk about voting rights. 
And I am going to admit something 
to you guys that will not surprise you 
because you know me: I am incredibly 
naive. At age 63, I am still incredibly 
naive. 
I came to the Senate in 2013. One of 
the first things that happened was the 
Supreme Court of the United States 
struck down the preclearance provision 
of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby 
v. Holder case. It happened when I had 
been here about 6 months. 
And the Supreme Court said: But 
Congress can fix this. Preclearance is 
fine. You just shouldn’t use a geo-
graphical requirement that dates back 
to 1965. Just come up with a new stand-
ard for which jurisdictions should have 
to preclear voting changes, and make 
it even-steven. 
So we quickly did come up with 
something: You only have to get 
preclearance if you have had a history 
of voting rights problems in the last 10 
years. If you don’t, no preclearance. We 
will treat every ZIP Code—north, west, 
east, 
south, 
midwest—exactly 
the 
same. 
We came up with it, and we went to 
Republicans. We went to Republicans 
knowing they were a great voting 
rights party—the 14th Amendment, the 
15th Amendment, the 19th Amendment. 
The women’s vote happened in a Demo-
cratic administration but with Repub-
lican support. The 26th Amendment— 
so 18-year-olds can vote—happened in 
the Nixon administration. 
But especially the Voting Rights Act, 
it wouldn’t have happened without 
rock-solid Republican support. It was 
always reauthorized with Republican 
support. 
So at this moment when the act is 
gutted, we go to Republicans and say: 
All you have to do is be consistent with 
the history of your party and help us 
fix the Voting Rights Act. 
One. In the House, in the Senate, 
where is this 150-year history of sup-
porting voting rights? Only one—only 
the senior Senator from Alaska, Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI, would join in this ef-
fort. 
I was so naive. I was so naive. But we 
are here today, and we have an oppor-
tunity. Why are we here? We know why 
we are here. 
After preclearance was struck down, 
there began to be an escalating ava-
lanche of laws to make it harder for

people to vote. Then we had a Presi-
dent who did a frontal assault on de-
mocracy itself: demeaning the democ-
racy; attacking election officials; try-
ing to dig up dirt on a Presidential op-
ponent from a foreign country; refusing 
to concede; filing meritless lawsuits; 
bringing about threats against election 
officials; 
violence 
in 
the 
Capitol, 
against the Capitol, against these 
Members, against the staffers, against 
Capitol Police, against our democracy; 
repeated efforts in States around the 
country to roll back; violent threats 
against election officials that persist 
even to today. 
That is why we are here. We are 
standing exactly in the same spot as 
that Senate stood in 1965: disenfran-
chisement efforts, coalesced by a gal-
vanizing action of violence—the beat-
ing of John Lewis on the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. We have 
an avalanche of disenfranchisement 
galvanized by an act of violence—the 
attack on this democracy, the physical 
attack on January 6. 
The time to act is now. 
Let me respond quickly to some com-
ments I have heard from colleagues 
this 
morning, 
particularly 
Senator 
CORNYN. You have heard again and 
again this theme that the bills we are 
attempting are a Federal takeover of 
elections. They use that—federalizing 
elections, a Federal takeover of elec-
tions. 
So here comes the history quiz part 
of my speech. Both Senators DURBIN 
and KLOBUCHAR have referred to this 
and read it, and I am going to do it 
again: ‘‘The Times, Places and Manner 
of holding Elections for Senators and 
Representatives, shall be prescribed in 
each State by the Legislature thereof; 
but the Congress may at any time by 
Law make or alter such Regulations.’’ 
How many times—how many times in 
the Constitution—can you read the 
phrase ‘‘at any time’’? The Constitu-
tion gives enormous powers to Con-
gress in article I, enormous powers to 
the President in article II, powers to 
the judiciary in article III, powers to 
the States, powers to voters. It is sort 
of assumed, when those powers are 
given, that they can be exercised at 
any time. 
But in one occasion—in one occasion 
only—the Framers decided: We had 
really better spell out ‘‘at any time.’’ 
The only use of that phrase in the Con-
stitution is to put an exclamation 
point, essentially, after the notion that 
Congress must be able to act at any 
time to alter or make regulations with 
respect to the Federal vote. 
Senator CORNYN said that 94 percent 
of people were happy after the Novem-
ber 2020 elections. Then why has the 
GOP decided to systematically weaken 
votes, take votes away, put obstacles 
in the path, kick out duly-sworn elec-
tion officials, and put decisionmaking 
in other people’s hands? 
Senator CORNYN said that this was a 
partisan effort. Partisan? Partisan? 
One of the chapters of our bill is non-
partisan redistricting. That is par-
tisan? 
Another part of our bill is complete 
transparency in all campaign contribu-
tions. How is that partisan? Go poll 
any 
Republican, 
Democrat, 
Inde-
pendent populous about what they 
think of transparency in campaign con-
tributions. It is overwhelmingly pop-
ular. We have made some of these 
changes in Virginia. Thank goodness 
that this bill would allow it. 
We just had a Governor’s race. Turn-
out went up by 20 percent, and a Re-
publican won. It wasn’t my candidate. 
It was good for democracy. 
This is not a partisan bill, even if the 
Republicans won’t stand up for it. 
Finally, the Republican leader and 
Senator CORNYN
started off with a 
lengthy ‘‘Well, why won’t you work on 
other stuff, like stuff about COVID, 
stuff about the economy?’’ My memory 
is pretty good. I think we were here in 
March dealing with a significant bill 
that 
was 
about 
vaccinations 
and 
COVID and support for small busi-
nesses and a whole series of things— 
hospitals, educational aid. How many 
Republicans voted for that bill, the 
American Rescue Plan—you know, the 
one that was COVID and the economy? 
None. Why don’t we pay attention to 
some other stuff? Well, we have been, 
generally with little support. 
I will close and say this: Congress 
may at any time, by law, make or alter 
such regulations—at any time. If not 
after the Supreme Court cuts the heart 
out of the Voting Rights Act, when? If 
not after an avalanche of State legisla-
tion carving back voting rights, when? 
If not after a violent attack, unprece-
dented in the history of this country, 
on the Capitol of the United States to 
disenfranchise 80 million people and 
disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, 
when? If not after subsequent Big Lies 
leading to action in State legislatures 
all over this country, when? 
We may act to protect Federal elec-
tions at any time. We are here for such 
a time, and the time to act is now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, most of 
you know that I have a real job besides 
being a U.S. Senator, and that real job 
includes farming the land, which in-
cludes 
spending—starting 
in 
the 
spring—12 to 16 hours a day on a trac-
tor, where you get an opportunity, 
after you are going around and around 
and around, to think about anything 
you want to think about. 
Before I got in this job, I used to do 
math problems. Since I have gotten in 
this job, I think about this job when I 
am on a tractor, and I think about the 
U.S. Senate. I think about how over 
the last 15 years this place has been in-
credibly dysfunctional. I have been 
here 15 years; I can’t speak to what it 
was like before that. But it has never 
worked since I have been here. The rea-
son it has never worked is because—I 
had this idea in my head that, being 
the U.S. Senate, it would be a place 
where we could have debate. In the 
greatest deliberative body, you ought 
to be able to have debate. I think I saw 
Senator DURBIN once almost get into a 
debate here, maybe twice. But it just 
simply doesn’t happen, and it doesn’t 
happen because we are not forced to do 
it because you take the easy way out. 
All you have to do is put a hold on a 
bill, and then you can walk out. In 
fact—I think it was my second year 
here—there was a Senator who put a 
hold on a bill and then went back to 
his home State. He didn’t even stick 
around. 
I don’t think that is what the fore-
fathers had in mind. I think what the 
forefathers had in mind is to stay here 
and have a discussion and have a de-
bate, and when people disagree, don’t 
be disagreeable, but try to find com-
mon ground. That doesn’t happen but 
rarely. 
So you ask yourself what can be done 
about it. I have had the opportunity 
over the last 3 months to work pretty 
extensively with my friend Senator 
KING and Senator KAINE and Senator 
MANCHIN and talk about ways we can 
move forward in a way that encourages 
people to come to the floor and debate, 
and I think there is a proposal to do ex-
actly that. This is a carve-out today, 
but the truth is that there is a proposal 
to protect minority rights and encour-
age people to come here and debate. 
We ought to be doing that. It isn’t 
nuking the body. It is not destroying 
the U.S. Senate. It means we get a 
chance to stand here in front of these 
cameras and challenge one another be-
cause we have to, because the rules 
force us to do that—not to go home to 
our home State, not to put a hold on a 
bill or a person and then not say a word 
why, not to be able to justify why you 
are doing that on the floor. 
So I see this in a little different light 
than has been described by some across 
the aisle, and I don’t think this is 
blowing the Senate up at all. I think 
the Senate—if the forefathers looked at 
the Senate today, they would sit there 
and shake their heads and say: What 
has gone wrong? 
I think what has gone wrong is, we 
have gotten lazy. It is the truth. The 
last place, truthfully, I want to be is on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate trying to 
justify my position. I mean, that is a 
lot of work. It takes time. It takes ef-
fort. We ought to be forcing people to 
do that. That is part of this debate we 
are having here today. 
We ought to realize that there is not 
a single Member of this body on either 
side of the aisle who wants to ‘‘blow 
this place up.’’ They might describe it 
that way. But the truth is, everybody 
who serves in this body knows that this 
body doesn’t function as the U.S. Sen-
ate. It doesn’t function. We don’t do 
what we need to do. We don’t empower 
committees. We don’t make sure our 
chairmen are doing what they need to 
do. We don’t debate on the U.S. Senate 
floor anymore, and we haven’t for 15

years and probably a heck of a lot 
longer. 
I happen to sit in the seat of Mike 
Mansfield. I don’t think Mansfield 
would look at this and say: This body 
works, and we ought not change the 
rules because it works so well. 
I think Mike Mansfield would say: Do 
you know what, guys? We did some 
changes in 1976. You need to take a 
look back. Things have changed here. 
We have cameras now we didn’t have 
in 1976. We have folks who come on the 
floor and raise a lot of money on this 
floor by talking to those cameras in-
stead of talking to one another about 
what is important here, about the poli-
cies we need to take up. 
So that is first thing. I don’t think 
we should be afraid about adjusting the 
filibuster to make the U.S. Senate 
work. I think it is the right thing to 
do—not blowing it up but making some 
adjustments to make it work. 
Now, let’s talk about voting rights 
for just a moment. I believe there are 
19 States in the United States right 
now that, on a purely partisan basis, 
have changed the way votes—either ac-
cess to the polls or the way votes are 
counted when they are done. I can’t 
imagine anybody in here, when you 
look at that—and it has all been done 
on a partisan basis by Republican legis-
latures—when you would look at that, 
you would say: Boy, this is moving our 
democracy forward. 
You know what. When I got in the 
State senate in 1999, I worked with a 
very conservative Republican on the 
State Administration Committee to 
make voting easier. We worked to-
gether. We both had the same ideas in 
mind. We wanted to make voting easier 
in Montana, and we did it. 
Now, it is a different world out there, 
and I really don’t know why. Let me 
give you an example. When I ran in 
2018, there were a record number of 
votes cast in Montana, and I won. A 
Democrat won. In 2020, there was even 
a larger number of votes that were cast 
in 2020, and a Republican won. This 
isn’t about advantages for Democrats 
or advantages for Republicans; this is 
about making it so everybody can have 
their 
voice 
heard—something 
very 
basic to this country, by the way. We 
stand up here and talk on the floor 
about how people have sacrificed for 
the rights and the freedoms in this 
country, and one of those freedoms is 
the freedom to vote. Lives have been 
sacrificed for it, but yet we want to 
limit certain groups of people from 
voting. 
In Montana, for example, they have 
said that student IDs—a college stu-
dent ID won’t work as an ID to go to 
the polling place. Are you kidding me? 
I mean, first of all, what kind of mes-
sage are you sending to the young peo-
ple who are going to be running this 
show—and probably a heck of a lot bet-
ter than we are—in just a few years? 
You are saying: Your voice doesn’t 
count. 
You 
want 
to 
talk 
about 
disenfranchising? This is crazy. It 
doesn’t make any sense. It is really 
hard for me to think how you justify— 
how do you justify saying this is a good 
thing to have happen? 
Voter registration. OK. Now, we are 
in this job. We all do this every day, 
think about it every day. So voter reg-
istration is probably no big deal to us. 
But to working people who have to pay 
the bills, having to take a half a day 
off of work to be able to go register 
when you can’t do it on election day— 
that is a big deal. 
We all stand up here, and we always 
say: We are for working families; they 
are the heartbeat of this country. And 
they are. But the truth is, what mes-
sage are we sending to them when we 
say: No, you know what, no more same- 
day voter registration—which, by the 
way, in Montana, it was a vote of the 
people, and the legislature, a year ago 
right now, repealed a vote of the people 
on same-day registration. So what 
message are we sending to those folks? 
My good friend RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
Senator WARNOCK, talks about stand-
ing in line for 8 or 10 hours to vote. 
First of all, I don’t know that I have 
the will to stand in line, personally, for 
8 or 10 hours to vote. I complained 
when they moved the polling place 3 
miles from my house to 15 miles from 
my house. But to stand in line for 8 to 
10 hours—I mean, that is a commit-
ment to vote. Now we are going to 
make it tougher? We are going to make 
it so that when there are Good Samari-
tans out there handing out water and 
maybe some soda crackers, we are 
going to say ‘‘No, that is illegal’’ and 
punish them—breaking the law; pun-
ishment by—God knows what. A fine? 
Jail? I don’t know. 
What is it? 
Mr. MERKLEY. A felony. 
Mr. TESTER. It is a felony. 
This is crazy, guys. We shouldn’t be 
acting like the stuff that is going on in 
this country right now and has been 
going on mainly for the last year—and 
my fellow Senators have talked about 
why it is the case—we shouldn’t act 
like it is no big deal. It is a huge deal. 
If we disenfranchise voters in this 
country, our democracy is on a slide 
away from democracy. 
As my friend ANGUS KING has said 
many times on this floor, democracies 
are the exception, they are not the rule 
in history. They have happened rarely, 
and they happen because people under-
stand the sacrifices it takes. 
We have sacrifices we need to make 
in this body, and part of it is, we need 
to ensure that everybody has equal ac-
cess to the polls so that they can vote. 
It is fundamental to our democracy. 
That is why we are all sitting here. If 
it wasn’t fundamental to our democ-
racy, do you know what? I would be 
doing something else. I would be in my 
office working on papers or something 
like that—who knows. But the truth is, 
this is fundamental to our democracy. 
We can try to, you know, move the 
conversation and say: Why aren’t we 
talking about the economy? Senator 
KAINE said it very, very well. We have 
dealt with economic issues. We need to 
continue to deal with economic issues. 
We have dealt with supply chain issues 
with the bipartisan infrastructure bill. 
We need to continue to work with sup-
ply chain issues as we move forward, 
and we will. But I will tell you, if we 
disenfranchise enough folks from the 
polls, we won’t have a democracy to 
talk about anything because it is fun-
damental to our democracy. 
I would just encourage everybody to 
take a look at the bill that is presented 
today, the two bills. Look at it. Don’t 
talk about the one that was presented 
in 2018 or 2019. We can all do that. That 
distracts from what is really going on. 
Look at the bill and ask yourself, ‘‘Is 
this really a Federal takeover of elec-
tions?’’ It absolutely is not. It is about 
making it so people can go to the polls 
and make their voices heard and feel 
like they are making a difference in 
the country by voting for the can-
didates whom they want or, in some 
cases, voting against the candidates 
they don’t like. 
And as far as the filibuster goes, 
times change, things change. And one 
of the things that has changed in this 
body is we don’t debate anymore. I am 
for anything that will get people to the 
floor so we can debate the issues that 
are so important to the future of this 
country. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
have had an opportunity to listen 
closely to my friend Senator KAINE, 
who asked the important question 
about voting rights, about when—when 
are we going to act? And that is a ques-
tion that is something that we, each of 
us, need to ask ourselves is ‘‘when.’’ 
But I think we also need to keep in 
mind the ‘‘how’’ we act because I think 
how we act is important—because I 
think we recognize that when we act 
unilaterally as a party on issues that 
are of great weight and great political 
debate in this country, that solutions 
to these difficult problems come best 
when we are able to be working to-
gether. 
I know that we are very fractured in 
this body, and it has made it hard, but 
hard does not mean it is impossible. It 
is only impossible if we give up, and we 
say it can’t be done. 
To my friend from Montana—and I 
appreciate the commonsense words of a 
man of the earth, a good farmer—amen 
to what you said about this body and 
our dysfunctionality. We are not the 
same Senate that I came to close to 20 
years ago. I beat you by about 5 years, 
6 years. We are not that same body. We 
are not operating in the manner with 
which I think we really were designed 
to be—that tempering body, that delib-
erative body. We are supposed to be the 
world’s greatest deliberative body, and 
we don’t demonstrate that on any sin-
gle day out there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S290 
January 19, 2022 
But I question whether or not chang-
ing the rules actually works to change 
the attitude because that is what I 
think we have going on here. The rules 
have been in place for a long while. It 
is just how we have chosen to utilize 
them to our advantage and to the dis-
advantage of the other side, and that is 
unfortunate. 
I don’t know how—it is much easier, 
I think, to change the rules than it is 
to change attitude. It is much easier to 
try to do things alone than to try to 
build consensus. Just ask any one of 
the 10 of us who worked tirelessly last 
year to advance a bipartisan infra-
structure bill. There were so many 
points along the way where any one of 
us or any half of the group could have 
said: We are done. This is just too hard. 
We are never going to make progress. 
But just because it is hard doesn’t 
mean it is impossible. 
The Senator from Montana urged us 
all to read the measure before us, the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, 
now pending before the Senate. It has a 
few new things that have been added 
in, but much of it is what we saw pre-
viously with the Freedom to Vote Act. 
I voted against that motion for clo-
ture when it came before us because I 
looked at that as being a bill that was 
overly prescriptive. In my view, it real-
ly did work toward nationalizing elec-
tions. I come from a State where 
things are just a little bit different 
there. You hear me talk about it all 
the time. Part of it is dictated by the 
geography. Part of it is dictated by an 
indigenous population where the lan-
guage that is on the ballot doesn’t 
align with what they speak at home 
and how we address matters like that. 
What has happened with this meas-
ure in front of us is it has been com-
bined with the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, which I have 
worked on in good faith with good col-
leagues whom I respect enormously, 
and I appreciate that we have been able 
to sit down. In fairness, much of the 
good work goes to our respective staffs 
who sat down and said: All right, can 
we do a little bit over here? What do we 
need to do over here? And we made 
some 
progress. 
We 
made 
enough 
progress that I was certainly willing to 
vote to advance debate here on the 
Senate floor on that measure. 
I recognize that not everybody sees 
the 
value 
and 
the 
benefits 
of 
preclearance. I recognize what the 
courts did in Shelby, but I also heard, 
as Senator KAINE said, the courts say-
ing: All right, legislative branch, do 
something about it now. 
So I have been willing to be part of 
that discussion, not only this Congress 
but in previous Congresses, where I 
have joined with Chairman LEAHY to 
try to advance that conversation. We 
haven’t been as successful as I would 
have liked, but I certainly think we 
made good progress with the John 
Lewis voting rights bill. 
We had a substitute. As I look 
through this bill, it looks like much of 
that substitute has been incorporated, 
including the Native American Voting 
Rights Act, which I worked hard on in 
the Indian Affairs Committee with 
Chairman SCHATZ to try to make that 
as robust as we possibly can. I have 
done all this because I do believe—I do 
believe—that this Senate should pass a 
reauthorization of the Voting Rights 
Act, but I also believe that it must be 
a bipartisan effort. 
It has been 16 years since we last ad-
dressed the Voting Rights Act. We need 
to do more than just talk about it; we 
need to ensure that the ballot is equal 
for all Americans and free from any 
discrimination. It is pretty simple for 
me in that regard. And wherever you 
have uncertainty, wherever you have 
ambiguity in the laws that govern our 
Federal elections, we need to clarify 
these. We need to clarify these so that 
there aren’t these open questions or 
perhaps cynical interpretations that 
would go with them. 
So how do you do it? Because this is 
all hard stuff. We acknowledge that. 
We acknowledge that. You really do 
have to do it coming together to try to 
hear the objections. 
As I look at the measure that we 
have before us, I am not convinced that 
we are there yet. I am not convinced 
that we are there yet with the product 
that we have. I will absolutely agree 
that there are some good—I think 
there are some important provisions in 
the measure that we have in front of 
us. But what we are faced with today, 
or later today, is going to be a take-it- 
or-leave-it vote and then an effort to 
change how we approach hard issues. 
Before I get into my comments in 
that vein, I do want to look at and 
highlight what I think are some of the 
positives that we have in place be-
cause—I think of a collaborative effort, 
but because we have shared observa-
tions, we have shared views on what 
some of these solutions may be, and I 
think that these can help us in anchor-
ing a more broadly supported bill. 
The measure features transparency 
provisions that require public notice of 
changes to State voting rules for Fed-
eral elections. I think we would all say: 
Yes, this is important. This is common 
sense. 
It has changes to electoral district 
boundaries for elections at all levels, 
information about precincts and poll-
ing places for Federal elections. These 
are things that I think there is con-
sensus here. We have stronger protec-
tions, necessary protections for voters 
during registration and voting as well 
as protections for election workers, 
polling places, election infrastructure. 
The measure emphasizes the security 
of voting systems. I think we recog-
nize, again, this is imperative. It has to 
be a priority. If we are going to thwart 
any malign actors out there, maintain 
confidence in election results, we have 
to have this. 
Important to me, it extends the bilin-
gual election requirements of the Vot-
ing Rights Act for 5 years. It also in-
cludes the Native American Voting 
Rights Act, again, that we worked on 
in the Indian Affairs Committee to ad-
dress, unfortunately, very longstanding 
obstacles to voting for American Indi-
ans and Alaska Natives. 
So there is good stuff, if you will, 
good measures that are contained with-
in the bill in front of us. 
But we also have some negatives. I 
think you have heard my colleagues 
detail many of them—not only nega-
tives within the text but in terms of 
this partisan effort that we have in 
front of us. 
We have a measure that is 753 pages 
long. We can move through that. We 
are not going to say just because it is 
big doesn’t mean that we can’t do it 
again. But it has come over to us 
through a shell vehicle. It is now di-
rectly on the legislative calendar. You 
have, again, this combination of two 
bills, plus a few add-ons. 
But, 
unfortunately, 
neither 
of 
these—even with my support of the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act—neither 
one of these had sufficient support to 
pass cloture. Since then, we haven’t 
done anything. I shouldn’t say ‘‘any-
thing’’ because there were a few addi-
tional provisions that were included. I 
don’t want to dismiss that. But not 
much has been done to build support 
cooperatively in this body for the two 
combined measures, other than to 
build pressure to, not change the legis-
lation, not to modify it, not to gain 
compromise—but to change the rules 
to take it up. 
This is a big bill, but one of the 
things that we don’t have contained in 
it that many of us have been talking 
about now for a period of time is we 
don’t address the Electoral Count Act, 
which I think most of us would look at 
this and say that this is something 
that needs to be revised. 
We do not need a repeat of 2020 when, 
by all accounts, our last President, 
having lost the election, sought to 
change the results of that election by 
demanding that his Vice President ex-
ploit vague statutory language that 
was written decades ago. We need to 
address this. 
The bill before us has some gaps, but 
at the same time that it has gaps, it is 
also pretty prescriptive in many areas. 
Some of the previous objections that I 
had made to the Freedom to Vote Act 
remain. 
I share with my colleagues that I 
want us to protect voting rights. I 
think we should all want to protect 
voting rights. But my concern is that, 
as we look at this measure, is that it is 
going to make any kind of a change— 
any kind of a change that States would 
make to their election laws for any 
reason—extremely difficult to do with-
out being directly challenged in court. 
And maybe—maybe—that is the goal 
here. But what it does do, in my view, 
is deprives States of the flexibility to 
design and implement their own laws 
as the Constitution provides. 
Again, I look to my State for some of 
those very specific examples where, if I

have a small remote village with per-
haps 100 voters and I have a prescrip-
tion in Federal law that says a polling 
place must be open and available for a 
period of a week to 10 days with 2 
weekends—if you are out in a village 
and you are living a sustenance life-
style, Saturday or Sunday don’t mean 
anything to you. It is winter. When are 
the animals moving? When are the fish 
moving? 
Let’s not put limits on our States so 
that they can’t enhance opportunities 
for all voters. 
So federalization is not the right an-
swer here, and, again, whether we are 
talking voting rights or other issues, 
typically in my State a one-size-fits-all 
approach is not the right effort. So we 
have got to find an appropriate balance 
that doesn’t result in a takeover of 
States’ ability to run their own elec-
tions, and how we are able to achieve 
that balance is important. 
So as I talk about my views on the 
legislation that we have before us, I am 
very, very well aware that the results 
of this effort to push voting rights was, 
unfortunately, determined before we 
began this debate. We are going to 
come to a vote on a motion to invoke 
cloture. We know what is going to hap-
pen. It is going to fail due to a lack of 
sufficient support. And then we are 
going to face some kind of a vote to 
change the Senate’s rules and weaken 
the legislative filibuster, which we also 
understand will fail. And I guess the 
point here is to get folks on record, and 
that will happen. 
But what have we accomplished? 
What have we accomplished for the 
people that we serve? Instead of allow-
ing us as a body to say, ‘‘OK, what are 
we going to do to address this,’’ we 
have brought cross-party relationships 
to yet another low—perhaps, an un-
precedented low. 
I was part of a very troubling con-
versation last evening, and it was 
shared that, you know, depending on 
which side you are on in this body 
today on this issue, you are either a 
racist or a hypocrite. Really? Really? 
Is that where we are? I find that so, so 
hard and so troubling, because when it 
becomes that deep and that divided 
where we cannot have the debate that 
my friend from Montana says we 
need—and I agree we need—but if we 
are so, so divided, this is not right. 
This is not good for the health of the 
body. 
But what has happened here is we 
have devolved into a debate over voting 
rights versus voting rules, and you 
have got part of the country that 
thinks this bill is about protecting the 
right to vote. Another part believes 
that this bill will do nothing but un-
dermine it. And so we are both sitting 
in a situation, I think, where both 
sides are now set to cast doubt on elec-
tions if they don’t win. And that takes 
us to a very troubling place, because 
when people doubt whether their vote 
matters, when they doubt whether that 
individual who is sitting in the White 
House was freely and fairly elected, 
they will doubt all decisions. They will 
doubt what we do here, and they will 
doubt their own democracy. And that 
is troubling for our Nation. 
So I refuse to believe that this is the 
best that we can do right now. As I 
said, this is hard, but hard is not im-
possible. I think that we can, if we are 
operating in good faith, as there are so 
many in this body who do that on a 
daily basis—it doesn’t get noted be-
cause, quite honestly, it is far more in-
teresting to write about the fur that 
flies around here, rather than us actu-
ally making things happen together. 
But the effort to change our rules, to 
pass legislation on a party-line basis is 
not going to help us here. It is not 
going to help us here. I think we need 
to do everything that we possibly can 
to avoid further polarizing voting 
rights and election reforms. 
It may be too late. I don’t know. It 
may be just too late, but I think we 
have to try. I think that we have to 
try. And I think that there is an effort 
to try to do just that. There is a good 
handful of people in this body on both 
sides of the aisle who have been talking 
this, through kind of following the 
model of what we did with the bipar-
tisan infrastructure group. 
You know, when we first started that 
effort, nobody believed that we would 
be successful with that. Probably, most 
listening to the debate that is going on 
now and will go on later all throughout 
the afternoon don’t believe that we can 
do anything. But let’s prove them 
wrong. Let’s prove them wrong. Let’s 
sit down with those who have made 
that commitment—we have heard it 
here on the floor—made that commit-
ment to work through some of these 
issues, some of these areas of common 
ground that I think we can build a base 
from, and work to build a foundation 
that will be enduring for this country 
when it comes to election reform and 
voting rights, because I fear greatly 
that if we are to advance measures 
that are solely, strictly party line—and 
that is what eliminating the legislative 
filibuster will allow us to do—we will 
take the easy way out. 
Senator 
TESTER
suggested 
that 
maybe we are getting a little legisla-
tively lazy around here. We will get 
even lazier, because we don’t have to 
do the hard work of trying to find con-
sensus. Elections and voting rights are 
so important. We understand that. 
Let’s commit to resolving the issues 
that divide us, that will not only help 
bring this Congress closer together, but 
that just possibly, just hopefully—and 
maybe 
I, 
too, 
am 
naive, 
Senator 
KAINE—but that just possibly can help 
heal this country, because that is what 
we need right now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are 
here today to talk about our democ-
racy, and here is what I know about 
how a democracy actually works. I 
come out here to the Senate floor 
every day, just like every Member of 
this Chamber, and I fight for what I be-
lieve in. And I use my voice to do that, 
and I use my vote to do that. 
The same is true for every citizen of 
this country. They use their vote to 
say what they want the future of our 
democracy to look like. But, right now, 
States across the country are taking 
away that right. They are taking away 
their voice. 
We have to make sure that every 
vote is never taken away, that no voice 
is taken away, or we are going to lose 
the democracy in the future. 
And here is what is happening right 
now. Republican legislatures are mak-
ing it hard to vote for certain groups of 
people—primarily 
Black 
Americans, 
Native Americans, young people, and 
people with disabilities, just because 
they might vote for a Democrat. 
This is a national coordinated effort 
to keep Republicans in power at every 
level of government by keeping Ameri-
cans away from the ballot box, by 
keeping Americans from being able to 
use their voice and their vote. Specifi-
cally, Republican legislatures are pass-
ing legislation to make it harder for 
people to vote by mail; drastically 
eliminating the availability of secure 
drop boxes so people can safely drop off 
their ballot; and reducing early voting 
hours or days. 
And it is all done to demoralize and 
discourage people—working 
people— 
from making their voices heard and to 
make the democratic process so much 
more cumbersome. That is a mom who 
is juggling childcare and schooling dur-
ing the pandemic, who is going to look 
for options to get that ballot in, to get 
her voice in, to get her vote in, and she 
won’t able to find a way to do that 
with all of her responsibilities. 
Maybe there is not a drop box near 
her, or maybe early voting hours have 
been cut short, or maybe the new rules 
about voting by mail are just too com-
plicated. 
Because of those barriers that are 
being erected in Republican legisla-
tures, that mom will not get to advo-
cate for her kids or her community 
with her vote. And too many Repub-
licans want it to work exactly like 
that. 
And those far-right politicians also 
want to pick their own voters—lit-
erally drawing lines between commu-
nities to reinforce partisan divides. 
Congressional Democrats are work-
ing to do the opposite. Instead of let-
ting politicians draw maps to rig the 
outcomes in favor of one party or an-
other, we just want to end partisan ger-
rymandering. 
Because—let’s 
be 
clear—people 
should pick their representatives in the 
United States of America, not the 
other way around. And what we are 
seeing happening across the country is 
undemocratic, and in no uncertain 
terms, it is a threat to this democracy. 
And if you don’t believe me, look at 
what the former President said just

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S292 
January 19, 2022 
this past weekend. Donald Trump, the 
leader of the Republican Party, con-
tinues as we know to spread the lie 
that the 2020 election was stolen from 
him. He is working hard, out in the 
open, to convince every American that 
he can that our free, fair election in 
2020 was illegitimate. 
But even more concerning is the 
former President’s explicit stated de-
termination to rig the outcome of fu-
ture elections. In a recent recorded 
message Donald Trump said: 
We have to be a lot sharper the next time 
when it comes to counting the vote. . . . 
Sometimes the vote counter is more impor-
tant than the candidate. 
More important than the candidate? 
And what Donald Trump means in this 
case was clear. He wants his loyalists 
to oversee our elections to make sure 
the outcome is always in his favor. I 
mean, just sit with that. We are not 
talking about hypotheticals here. The 
leader of the Republican Party wants 
to toss democracy out the window and 
change the outcome of any election re-
sults he doesn’t like. 
History is sitting on our shoulders 
right now. The American people are 
looking to us for a way to move for-
ward and protect the right to vote, and 
this is it. And all that is standing in 
our way is Senate procedure—Senate 
procedure that a majority of us voted 
last month to change. 
Now, I understand the reluctance 
around reforming the filibuster. I do. I 
understand we want this institution to 
work, to be bipartisan when it comes 
to tackling big challenges. But here is 
the deal: I don’t think that carving out 
a path to pass voting rights on a simple 
majority precludes that. 
In fact, I think it is past time that 
we reform the filibuster to make sure 
the world’s greatest deliberative body 
actually deliberates the issues and 
challenges that are facing the Amer-
ican people. 
But today’s Senate procedure keeps 
us from that kind of deliberation. Sen-
ate rules not unlike the partisan gerry-
mandering we are seeing in States 
across the country push Democrats and 
Republicans further into their corners, 
rather than toward collaboration, mak-
ing it unbelievably easy to block legis-
lative action and nearly impossible to 
start it. 
And that means Americans do not 
get to see where elected officials stand 
on issues as consequential as pro-
tecting the right to vote. To even have 
the debate we are having right now, we 
had to dig through Senate rules and 
quite literally repurpose a bill that al-
lows NASA to lease its property. Oth-
erwise, we wouldn’t even be standing 
here on the floor today to have this 
discussion about voting rights. That 
does not make sense. 
It should not be so difficult to make 
it so the public can see where each of 
us stands. And let’s remember that 
these voter suppression laws are all 
being passed mainly on a partisan basis 
with simple majorities. 
Now, some have suggested that if we 
believe these laws are unconstitutional 
we should fight them in the courts, 
take our arguments all the way to the 
Supreme Court. But remember, there 
are three Supreme Court Justices all 
appointed by a simple majority of this 
Senate without the filibuster. 
So let’s recap. Republicans want to 
appoint judges without a filibuster 
standing in their way. They want Re-
publican State lawmakers to be able to 
pass voter suppression laws without a 
filibuster. But Democrats can’t protect 
the basic right to vote on a simple ma-
jority. 
That is what we are talking about 
here today: making election day a Fed-
eral holiday, making sure everyone can 
vote by mail, ending gerrymandering 
so voters can pick their politicians and 
not the other way around. These are 
simple, straightforward reforms, with 
tremendous significance for our coun-
try’s future as a democracy. 
And the path to getting them done is 
simple and straight forward too. What 
each of us has to do is decide that our 
democracy comes before Senate proce-
dure and then cast our votes. 
I have made my decision, and here is 
what I believe: We cannot let the fili-
buster stop us from protecting every 
American’s right to vote. If it is the fil-
ibuster or democracy, I will choose de-
mocracy. If it is the Senate rules or a 
Senate that works for the American 
people, I will choose a Senate that 
works. 
And I urge my colleagues with all of 
my heart, for the sake of this democ-
racy, to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I am 
here today to address Democrat leader-
ship’s effort to demolish the Senate 
rules and structure, and thereby de-
stroy the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Their ploy would silence millions 
of Americans, and it would substan-
tially harm our Nation. 
Abolishing the filibuster would end 
the Senate’s unique role in American 
Government, which has kept us on the 
steady course of becoming a more per-
fect union for the past 230 years. This 
unique role is to ensure that Federal 
legislation, covering all 50 States, re-
quires careful debate and broad sup-
port, often reflecting compromise, so 
that American policy is durable and 
lasting. 
That way, as the senior Senator from 
Arizona put it in her courageous and 
patriotic remarks last week, we avoid 
‘‘wild reversals in Federal policy’’ 
every few years on the basis of bare 
majorities, which would make our gov-
ernment far less effective and our econ-
omy far less stable. 
Democrats know how integral the fil-
ibuster is to American Government. 
Democrats have said it themselves. 
Eliminating the filibuster would ‘‘be 
the end of the Senate.’’ That is a direct 
quote from the senior Senator from Il-
linois in 2018. 
The Democratic leader, before as-
suming his current position, said that 
eliminating the filibuster would ‘‘be a 
doomsday for democracy.’’ 
And President Biden, when he was 
Senator Biden, said that to eliminate 
the filibuster would be ‘‘the arrogance 
of power.’’ Apparently, he is now suf-
fering from such arrogance. 
Until they took control of the Senate 
last year, most Democrats passionately 
advocated for preserving this critical 
Senate rule. That is because it enables 
our representative government to func-
tion and reflect the will of the people. 
Indeed, in 2017, when there was a Re-
publican in the Oval Office and a Re-
publican majority in the Senate, 32 
Democrats, 
including 
then-Senator 
Kamala Harris, signed a letter sup-
porting the filibuster. 
During the Trump administration, 
Democrats routinely used the filibuster 
to block Republican legislation, includ-
ing bills on police reform, border secu-
rity, and late-term abortions; impor-
tant bills that impacted life, sov-
ereignty, and community safety—cer-
tainly, bills that Republicans wanted 
to enact. 
Yet, when met with the filibuster, 
Republicans didn’t change the rules on 
a completely partisan basis. Repub-
licans didn’t tear down this institution 
in order to score short-term partisan 
political points, and Republicans cer-
tainly didn’t use cheap demagoguery to 
create a fake hysteria to justify doing 
so. 
Yet now that Democrats are in the 
majority, nearly every one of those 32 
Democrats has completely reversed 
himself or herself, with a few notable 
exceptions. Why? Because this is about 
one thing: Power. Doing the exact 
same thing is a doomsday for democ-
racy when it is a bill they oppose, but 
it is essential to save democracy when 
it is a bill they support. It is about 
power. 
There doesn’t seem to be a power 
grab that is too extreme for the mod-
ern left, whether it is abolishing the 
filibuster, packing the Supreme Court, 
or making the District of Columbia a 
State. There is no institution that they 
aren’t willing to destroy. 
This is shameful because Democrat 
leaders’ past statements show that 
they know that destroying the Senate 
would be disastrous for our Nation. 
Let’s call this what it is. It is worse 
than a solution in search of a problem. 
It is a power grab in search of a crisis. 
In this case, they had to manufacture a 
crisis to justify the power grab. 
They have been trying to pass this 
bill for years. Democrat operatives 
first introduced a version of this bill on 
January 24, 2017, 4 days after President 
Trump was elected to office. It was 
part of their scorched-earth policy to 
challenge the 2016 election results, 
clinging to the false claims of Russian 
collusion. Since then, they have con-
tinued to maniacally, and on a wholly 
partisan basis, push this electioneering 
fantasy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S293 
January 19, 2022 
Even though this bill is about keep-
ing power, they use whatever justifica-
tion is most convenient at the mo-
ment. In 2017, it was President Trump 
and Russia. In 2020, it was the pan-
demic. And now, it is the preposterous 
claim that returning to prepandemic 
voting practices is the end of democ-
racy. 
This election takeover would impose 
taxpayer-funded campaigns. It pro-
hibits overwhelmingly popular, com-
monsense State voter ID laws. What 
does nullifying voter ID laws and hand-
ing out taxpayer-funded campaign dol-
lars have to do with voting rights? 
Last night, the senior Senator from 
Virginia pointed out that Republicans 
have always led the way on voting 
rights. So why not now? Because this 
bill 
isn’t 
about 
protecting 
voting 
rights. It is about protecting politi-
cians. This isn’t the 14th Amendment. 
It is Washington Democrats’ 14th at-
tempt to take over elections in all 50 
States for the third different reason in 
the last several years. 
Americans want laws that make it 
easy to vote and hard to cheat. Such 
laws currently exist throughout the 
country. That is why we had record-
breaking voter participation in 2020, in-
cluding in my home State of Ten-
nessee. 
So ask yourself: With more Ameri-
cans voting in the last election than 
ever before, why is this Democrats’ top 
priority? Why are they willing to de-
stroy the Senate to do it? What is the 
real reason they are focusing on this 
made-up crisis, while ignoring actual 
crises of inflation, falling real wages, 
soaring energy prices, supply chain cri-
ses, a collapsed southern border, the 
collapse of Afghanistan, and increased 
authoritarian aggression around the 
world—real problems that actually af-
fect the American people? 
Democrat leaders have tuned out 
those concerns. They are taking no ac-
tion to address them. Think about it. 
Our country has the highest inflation 
rate in 40 years, and the Senate Bank-
ing Committee, which has jurisdiction 
over our Nation’s monetary policy, has 
not held a single hearing examining 
this topic since it began in 2021. 
To avoid those issues, they have cre-
ated a fake crisis to take over elec-
tions—a desperate attempt at self-pres-
ervation because Americans are reject-
ing their agenda. That is the real rea-
son Democrats are pushing this. It is 
about protecting the power of politi-
cians here in Washington. 
Elections should be determined by 
the voters, not by the politicians. 
Last week, President Biden traveled 
to Georgia to demonize all Americans 
who don’t submit to this hyperpartisan 
political agenda. He ranted that Ameri-
cans who support the constitutional 
system of free, fair, and locally run 
elections are somehow bigots. 
In support of this scheme, the Demo-
crat leader offers the talking point 
that State legislatures don’t have fili-
buster rules so why should the U.S. 
Senate? 
The answer to this is obvious: be-
cause Federal legislation governs all 50 
States, as opposed to State legislation 
that just affects one State. It requires 
broader support, more than a bare ma-
jority in a 50–50 Senate. 
This is the greatest Nation on Earth, 
and the Senate is its compass. This 
isn’t the Democrat leaders’ political 
play thing. 
Ensuring broad support for Federal 
laws, which ensures American sta-
bility, is the very purpose of the U.S. 
Senate. Sadly, this election power grab 
is just the start. With the filibuster 
gone, Democrats would be free to enact 
mass 
amnesty, 
pack 
the 
Supreme 
Court, pack the Senate, punish law en-
forcement officers, and much, much 
more. 
It was my hope, coming into this new 
year, that the Senate would refocus on 
what we were elected to do: Listen to 
the American people and address their 
concerns. Yet the recent rhetoric of 
Democrat leadership has dispelled any 
such optimism. 
The American people deserve a gov-
ernment that acknowledges their con-
cerns and works tirelessly and con-
structively to address them. The seri-
ous problems we face as a nation de-
mand it. 
Americans want us to do our jobs. 
Abolishing the Senate’s rules that 
guarantee 
debate 
and 
compromise 
would be ‘‘the end of the Senate,’’ as 
the senior Senator from Illinois put it. 
It would do irreparable harm to the 
fabric of our government and to the co-
hesion of our Nation. 
I 
hope 
my 
colleagues 
find 
the 
strength and the courage to maintain 
their previous, longstanding support 
for preserving the Senate’s role. I hope 
they reject this cynical move to steam-
roll half of its Members and the voters 
they represent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, col-
leagues, with Senator KAINE as my wit-
ness, I, like many of you, had an oppor-
tunity to stand here yesterday to begin 
to speak on the issues before us—the 
need for this urgent and critical voting 
rights legislation and our opportunity 
to act this week in the spirit of the 
holiday we celebrated on Monday, Mar-
tin Luther King Day. 
Before I get into my substantive re-
marks, I just feel compelled to respond 
to a couple of items that Senator 
HAGERTY just mentioned. And if he is 
willing to stay and listen, that would 
be appreciated, but that is his choice. 
You know, a couple of our Repub-
lican colleagues have made mention to: 
Well, we shouldn’t focus on voting 
rights; there are other pressing issues 
at hand, things like the economy. 
Well, last I checked, because of our 
actions last year, especially the invest-
ments in the American Rescue Plan, 
wages are up and unemployment is at 
record lows. 
Democrats are taking action. We 
have been called out on what are we 
doing to address supply chain issues. 
We have acted. The infrastructure and 
jobs act has been signed by the Presi-
dent, and I can attest that in the Ports 
of Long Beach and Los Angeles, the 
percentage of containers waiting to be 
picked up is drastically down. Demo-
crats are taking action. 
COVID. Yeah, we are still dealing 
with 
this 
once-in-a-century 
global 
health pandemic. But imagine how 
much better a position we would be in, 
how many lives we would have saved, if 
the Trump administration took respon-
sible action much earlier in this pan-
demic, and imagine how fewer cases 
and deaths we would have to count if 
more people would get vaccinated. 
Senator HAGERTY, like many Repub-
licans, says: Well, when it comes to 
voting and elections, we should be fo-
cusing on making it easier to vote and 
harder to cheat. Who wouldn’t agree 
with that? 
But here is the truth. Here is reality. 
We know what it takes to make it easi-
er to vote. That is what we are calling 
for in the Freedom to Vote Act, and I 
will go through some of the specifics 
here in a minute. But ‘‘the harder to 
cheat’’ misses the point. The evidence 
is there. The data is out there. Massive 
voter fraud doesn’t exist. Voter fraud is 
exceedingly rare in America. So we got 
the ‘‘harder to cheat’’ part down, if 
only Republican Senators and legisla-
tures and Governors, for that matter, 
would embrace the proven reforms that 
make it easier for eligible Americans 
to cast their ballot in our democracy. 
But the most egregious, I just have 
to say, when Senator HAGERTY sug-
gests that changes to elections law 
should only be done after careful de-
bate and broad support, I invite him to 
say the same things to Governors and 
legislators in Georgia, in Texas, in Ari-
zona, and elsewhere, and I will go 
through some examples in the course of 
my presentation. 
But, colleagues, as I have had an op-
portunity to share with many of you, 
you know that, before I joined the Sen-
ate last year, I served for 6 years as 
California’s chief elections officer. I 
served as California secretary of state, 
the largest State in the Nation with 
the largest and most diverse electorate 
in the Nation. And in that role, I had a 
chance to oversee a side of election ad-
ministration that most Americans and 
most U.S. Senators never really experi-
ence. Former State secretaries of state 
serving in this body: Senator BLUNT, 
Senator BROWN, Senator MANCHIN, and 
myself, the most recent. And my expe-
rience, by the way, included overseeing 
the administration of the November 
2020 Presidential election in the most 
populous State in the Nation. 
So I want to take a few minutes to 
explain exactly how the Freedom to 
Vote Act will help all voters and re-
spond to some more of the claims I 
have heard about this bill from my Re-
publican colleagues. 
See, the purpose of the Freedom to 
Vote Act is to give every eligible

American more choices about how and 
when they cast their ballot. No matter 
where you live, no matter which State, 
no matter which ZIP Code, no matter 
your political party preference, you de-
serve multiple, safe, secure, accessible 
options for registering to vote and for 
casting your ballot. 
Isn’t that what we were all supposed 
to have learned in high school govern-
ment class; that our democracy works 
best when as many people participate— 
the will of the people, not the will of 
the few, not the will of the privileged 
few, the will of the people. 
But today voters in different States 
take different paths to the ballot box, 
some more difficult than others, need-
lessly. And sometimes what some of 
you may view as a small obstacle can 
add up to a big deterrent to participa-
tion, depending on where you live, de-
pending on where you work, depending 
on your disability, and more. That is 
why the Freedom to Vote Act is so 
critical. It will help all Americans by 
guaranteeing the same baseline of ac-
cess to the ballot to all eligible Ameri-
cans. 
And, no, this is by no means a Fed-
eral takeover of elections. I appreciate 
that several of my colleagues have 
gone through the history of Congress 
acting to protect the right to vote and 
to improve elections. So let me really 
bottom line it and make this point. 
With the passage of the Freedom to 
Vote Act, it is not Congress that will 
be distributing ballots or the Federal 
Government that will be collecting bal-
lots and counting ballots. Election ad-
ministration will still be local. What 
we are doing is setting a baseline for 
access to the ballot for all eligible 
Americans, and, yes, it is appropriate 
for us to do so, as Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
Senator PETERS and others have ref-
erenced the Constitution, referenced 
prior congressional action, and I will 
point it out too. 
It has already been pointed out that 
in the Constitution, the Constitution 
of the United States, ‘‘The Times, 
Places and Manner of holding Elections 
for Senators and Representatives, shall 
be prescribed in each State by the Leg-
islature thereof; but the Congress may 
at any time by Law make or alter such 
Regulations.’’ 
That is what we are seeking to do. 
But I really want to up the ante, 
folks, and I need you to listen to me 
because there are two important words. 
Senator PETERS
gave you the list, 
right? The Voting Rights Act, the Help 
America Vote Act, the National Voter 
Registration Act, 1993, passed on a bi-
partisan basis. In it you will read that 
‘‘it is the duty of the Federal, State, 
and local governments to promote the 
exercise of [the fundamental right to 
vote].’’ 
I call your attention to two words, 
‘‘the duty’’ of government—not the op-
tion, not the if you wanna, not the 
may. 
The duty of government, to what? To 
promote the exercise of the funda-
mental right to vote—not just to sit 
back and make sure that elections are 
run fair and square, not just to say: 
Hey, it is up to you voters if you want 
to register to vote. Government has a 
duty to promote the exercise of the 
fundamental right to vote. 
So now to the specifics of the Free-
dom to Vote Act and how it tries to 
live up to that duty of government to 
promote. Well, as we all know, you 
can’t vote unless you are registered to 
vote, and different States have dif-
ferent options for how to register to 
vote. Once upon a time, you had to 
present yourself in person at a county 
courthouse. Imagine the innovation 
that it took, the getting out of the 
comfort zone, once upon a time, for 
folks around the country that we had 
the 
audacity 
to 
suggest: 
Wait 
a 
minute. You can register to vote by 
mail or sign a voter registration card 
under penalty of perjury that your in-
formation is true and correct, attesting 
to your eligibility. 
Now, some States have only the op-
tion of voting through that card or in 
person. Other States have innovated 
and accepted things like online voter 
registration—imagine that—or auto-
matic registration, same-day registra-
tion. 
Again, I want to talk to you in a 
minute about that. But let me give the 
big picture of why it is important. The 
numbers are out there. The data is out 
there. Who is it who tends to be eligi-
ble to vote in America but not reg-
istered to vote? Disproportionately, 
communities of color, disproportion-
ately low-income communities, dis-
proportionately young people—eligible 
voters—but voters of color, potential 
voters of color, young people, and low- 
income are disproportionately not reg-
istered. 
So we can either act—as the NVRA 
says, we have a duty to promote—to in-
crease those registration numbers or 
not. To live up to the duty, we need to, 
and if we don’t or perhaps even if we 
make it harder to vote or stay reg-
istered to vote, who are you dispropor-
tionately affecting? 
So Republicans can deny their in-
tent. We know the true effect of mak-
ing it harder to register to vote or to 
stay registered to vote. 
So, again, different States have dif-
ferent options. In Alaska, you can reg-
ister in person, by mail, online, auto-
matic 
voter 
registration. 
In 
Cali-
fornia—yes, I am proud—in person, by 
mail, automatic registration, online, 
election day same-day registration. In 
Texas, Mississippi, only in person or by 
mail. 
Different States, different rules. 
Everybody deserves the same oppor-
tunity. So why the value of online 
voter registration? Well, first of all, it 
is convenient, right? There is a whole 
lot that people have become accus-
tomed to doing online. Second, for the 
‘‘good government’’ types and the folks 
who want to make prudent use of pre-
cious taxpayer dollars, it lowers ad-
ministrative costs. When you allow 
voters to register online, it is seamless; 
it is quick; and it is easy. 
I have been to county election offices 
where you have clerical staff sitting 
there with a pile, a stack of voter reg-
istration cards that they have to read 
and input by hand—not very efficient. 
Online voter registration increases effi-
ciency and, by the way, accuracy. I 
don’t have the best penmanship. Can 
you imagine the clerical staff and 
county offices trying to make out, 
well, how do you spell this name that 
can be spelled three or four or five dif-
ferent ways. Online registration re-
duces those types of errors and cleans 
up the voting rolls and is very cost-effi-
cient to implement and has been prov-
en, in State after State, to be safe, se-
cure, and effective. 
But should online registration be the 
only option? No. And we shouldn’t take 
away the in-person or paper registra-
tion. Some States have innovated auto-
matic voter registration, where we 
take advantage of the opportunity 
when citizens are interfacing with 
their 
government—particularly 
the 
DMV. Ninety percent of eligible voters 
in America will either have a driver’s 
license or a State ID. And what are we 
asked to provide when we conduct that 
transaction? We are asked to provide 
our name, our address, our date of 
birth, a signature attesting to the ac-
curacy of our information—all the 
same information that is asked for 
when we are registering to vote. So it 
is just common sense to utilize that 
same transaction for eligible citizens 
to seamlessly be registered to vote at 
the same time. 
Going back to the National Voter 
Registration Act, which requires voter 
registration 
opportunity 
for 
people 
when they go to their Department of 
Motor Vehicles, that will serve as an 
opt-in model. Thanks to technology 
today, we can implement this opt-out 
model. You still have the option as a 
voter to not be registered to vote, if 
you choose not to, but the default is, if 
you are eligible, you are added to the 
voter rolls. And similar to online reg-
istration, it has been proven safe; it 
has been proven secure; it has been 
proven effective. From an elections 
perspective, it is wonderful. It doesn’t 
just capture previously eligible but un-
registered voters now adding them to 
the voter rolls. If you are already reg-
istered to vote, when you renew your 
license or your voter ID—guess what— 
you are asked: Is this your current ad-
dress? 
Now, when most people move, they 
are quick to do the change of address 
through the post office because they 
don’t want to miss out on their mail. 
You are updating your driver’s license 
or your ID because it has to reflect 
your current address. But a lot of peo-
ple don’t think of, ‘‘Oh, let me call the 
county and update my voter registra-
tion.’’ This is a seamless and effective 
way of doing that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S295 
January 19, 2022 
In California, our experience, similar 
to other States, for every new reg-
istered voter that was enrolled through 
automatic registration, you had at 
least two voters who updated or con-
firmed the accuracy of their registra-
tion. So, collectively, it leads to the 
most accurate voter rolls we have had 
in a long, long time. 
Isn’t that worth doing? Isn’t that in 
the interest of election integrity? 
And it is not a partisan idea. States, 
not just California, States like Alaska, 
represented by Republicans, have auto-
matic voter registration. The State of 
Maine, which has sent to this body a 
Republican and an Independent, has 
automatic voter registration. 
Now, here is a true lover of democ-
racy’s perspective on automatic reg-
istration. Reverend Warnock, I hope 
you can appreciate this. 
Colleagues, think about it. If you are 
eligible to vote in America today but 
not registered, you do not receive the 
State’s voter information guide if your 
State provides one because you are not 
on the list. If you are eligible to vote in 
America today but not registered, your 
county doesn’t send you your sample 
ballot to know when election day is, 
where to go, and what we are voting 
on. If you are eligible to vote in Amer-
ica today but not registered, chances 
are candidates and campaigns aren’t 
knocking on your door or calling you 
during dinner or flooding your mailbox 
trying to engage you in the democratic 
process. Maybe the smart campaigns 
and candidates are trying to reach out 
to more voters, but, by and large, that 
doesn’t happen. So the sheer addition 
of adding eligible Americans to the 
voter rolls creates that activity. 
Imagine 
that—civic 
engagement. 
Imagine that—participation in our de-
mocracy. But why stop there? 
Same-day registration option. What 
if you missed a prior artificial deadline 
of registering to vote or updating your 
registration and come election day you 
are still 18 years or older and a citizen 
of the United States? You deserve the 
opportunity to have your voice heard 
in that election and election adminis-
trators know how to do this. You can 
register to vote, and whether your reg-
istration is automatically processed for 
jurisdictions that have the technology 
and the history to do so or your reg-
istration is held and your ballot is 
held, you can still cast your ballot, 
have the county process your registra-
tion, and your voice is heard in that 
election. That is what democracy is 
supposed to be about. 
And, again, not partisan. Twenty 
States, including Republican-leaning 
States, 
have 
already 
implemented 
same-day registration, including Wyo-
ming, Idaho, and Utah. California im-
plemented—we technically call it con-
ditional voter registration, but start-
ing in 2017. 
In 2020—just to give you a flavor for 
what it means. In 2020, nearly 270,000 
California voters were same-day reg-
istered, 270,000. That is like half of a 
House district. Of all in-person Cali-
fornia voters in 2020, nearly 10 percent 
were same-day registered. 
The others—you know, why such a 
big number? Because so many people 
voted by mail, voted early, et cetera. 
And it is not partisan. Of the same-day 
registrants, 
when 
the 
registrations 
were processed, 36.2 percent were not 
affiliated with any political party. This 
is 32 percent Democrats and 25 percent 
Republicans. So it is not partisan. It is 
good for everybody. 
As we know, registration is only half 
the battle. Just because somebody may 
be registered doesn’t guarantee that 
they are going to cast their ballot. 
In going back to the NVRA, folks, 
the government has a duty to promote 
the exercise of our fundamental right 
to vote. So we have a duty to imple-
ment this, and these are proven re-
forms on the registration side. 
What about on the casting your bal-
lot side? 
Again, once upon a time, you had to 
show up in person on election day, only 
between this hour and that hour, at 
one designated location. In this modern 
economy, with so many different types 
of work schedules, that is not exactly 
easy. I live in Los Angeles, where we 
have this thing that we call traffic. So, 
if you have a job that is no longer 9 to 
5—imagine—and you have to drop the 
kids off at school before you leave for 
work and have a full day and are deal-
ing with traffic in getting back and 
have to get the kids from school and 
have to get dinner on the table, now I 
have got to go to one designated loca-
tion and be in line by a certain hour to 
vote. There has got to be a better way, 
and there is. 
Depending on the State where you 
live, you have options that include vot-
ing on election day in person; voting in 
person but early, prior to election day; 
or voting by mail—again, all proven, 
secure, effective ways to cast your bal-
lot. But we have a mishmash across the 
country. California and Alaska, by the 
way, have election day, vote-by-mail, 
and early voting. In Texas, it is on 
election day only or early voting, but 
there is very limited vote-by-mail. In 
Mississippi, sorry—election day only. 
In Connecticut, sorry—election day 
only. Yes, even Democratic States have 
room for improvement in making the 
process easier. 
We shouldn’t be hampered because of 
the demands on our time—family obli-
gations, work obligations. That is why 
States like Utah were early proponents 
of voting by mail. It is why States like 
Arizona were early proponents of early 
voting. So we should strive to provide 
all voters in America the same baseline 
of access to the ballot. Duty to pro-
mote—before the Freedom to Vote Act, 
that is exactly what we were trying to 
do. 
At this point, let me just reply to 
something our colleague Senator COR-
NYN referenced. I wish I could borrow, 
right now, the board that he had right 
next to him. Did you guys see that big 
‘‘94 percent’’ that he had on the board? 
He was citing a Pew Research Center 
report that said 94 percent of voters in 
the November 2020 election found it 
easy to vote. That is great, and I will 
tell you why. 
It is because, in 2020, because of the 
threat of the pandemic, even States 
that were resistant prior to affording 
voters more early voting options knew 
that it was smart to do so in order to 
reduce crowds and long lines on elec-
tion day. That is why States that were 
even reluctant prior to 2020 to expand 
their vote-by-mail opportunities knew 
that it was smart to do so so that peo-
ple could vote safely and securely from 
home, and it worked. It was the most 
secure election in our history, with 
record turnout. 
So, if that is the case, why go back-
ward? Why go backward? Because that 
is what they are doing in the States 
that have introduced and passed— 
what?—33, 34—and counting—laws that 
are making it harder to register to 
vote, harder to cast their ballots, 
which is contrary to the NVRA—duty 
to promote. 
So what are the options for early vot-
ing? 
As we mentioned, we want to be spe-
cific. See, most States already have 
some sort of in-person early voting op-
portunity, but it is inconsistent. Some 
offer weekends; some don’t. Some offer 
evening opportunities to vote; some 
don’t—or before work hours and after 
work hours. Every voter, regardless of 
the demands on your time, deserves 
equal opportunities to vote prior to 
election day, in person, if that is your 
choice. 
Mail voting. Again, a lot of States 
have some sort of mail voting, but we 
are specific to no-excuse voting by 
mail. Voting by mail is secure. It has 
been proven to be secure. So why have 
only a limited subset of the electorate 
been able to benefit from that? We saw 
it work beautifully in November 2020. 
Imagine how much better it could work 
once we are past the pandemic. Mail 
voting was pioneered, actually, in a lot 
of Western States, not blue or red. 
North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyo-
ming, Idaho, and Nebraska came along 
with Utah in doing all-mail elections 
in addition to Oregon, Washington, 
Colorado, and California. 
Let me tell you the other beauty of 
vote-by-mail, especially when we cover 
postage. I don’t have a roll of stamps in 
my kitchen drawer anymore, as very 
little is done that way, but when you 
are voting by mail, we can cover that 
postage delivery. You get your ballot 
in the mail; you give it back to your 
letter carrier; and it gets back to the 
county and is counted. 
Some people may wonder, though— 
and we have had this battle across the 
country and in these Chambers over 
the course of the last year—about what 
is happening at the Postal Service 
these days. Is mail quick? Is it slow? 
What about the pandemic? What about 
changes in processes and procedures 
under the postmaster?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S296 
January 19, 2022 
Well, in California—Colorado has it, 
as well, and other jurisdictions across 
the country—we have a tool that al-
lows voters to track their ballots 
through the mail. This is going to blow 
your mind. Imagine signing up to re-
ceive either phone calls, emails, or text 
messages on the status of your ballot 
through the mail service. Wow. 
Mr. PADILLA, the county just mailed 
you your ballot. Be on the lookout, 
right? It is going to come in the next 
few days. 
When I return it, I receive confirma-
tion that the Postal Service has taken 
possession of it, confirmation from the 
county when they have received my 
ballot, and confirmation when my bal-
lot has been counted. 
It is a great tool for administrators 
because you can identify bottlenecks in 
the delivery service, and you can go to 
a local branch and say: Hey, folks. 
Sorry. The Macy’s catalog can wait an-
other day. We have to get these ballots 
out on time because election day dead-
lines are looming. 
Then, for a voter to have that peace 
of mind that my ballot arrived and my 
vote was counted and my voice was 
heard, it is great for transparency and 
great for public confidence in the elec-
toral process. That is what vote-by- 
mail provides. 
So, similar to voter registration, 
with multiple, safe, secure options, it 
should be the same with voting, with 
multiple, safe, and secure, proven op-
tions—all to help us live up to the obli-
gation, the duty, to promote the exer-
cise of our fundamental right to vote. 
That is the opportunity that we have 
before us today, colleagues, either by 
approving the measure that has been 
sent over to us from the House, which 
encompasses both the Freedom to Vote 
Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act, or if we can’t do it 
consistent with our current rules, then 
let’s amend the Senate rules to allow 
us to do that—to protect the right to 
vote for all Americans—because our 
right to vote is under attack. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I had 
the privilege to listen to my colleague 
from California’s oration and the privi-
lege to hear many of the things spoken, 
both by the President and by col-
leagues here in the Senate, as regards 
to the voting rights bill that is here be-
fore us today. I want to start off with 
the President’s comments because I 
think it frames the debate, if you will, 
in terms of how it is being framed to 
the American people. 
The President considers Georgia’s 
new law as Jim Crow. That is a ma-
nipulative statement. It is a cynical 
statement. It tries to make people 
think that 2022 is the same as 1965, 
which is laced with incredible irony, as 
our country has seen an African-Amer-
ican President, an African-American 
Vice President, and Lieutenant Gov-
ernors of Virginia and Kentucky who 
are African American. Then, to brag of 
my own State, as long as things are 
being seen through certain prisms, we 
have Louisiana’s Bobby Jindal, who is 
ethnically from India, who was our 
Governor, and the first Vietnamese 
American elected to the U.S. Congress. 
In fact, Louisiana has had a White 
elected mayor of predominantly Afri-
can-American New Orleans and a Black 
elected mayor of predominantly White 
Baton Rouge. But no, this statement is 
somehow manipulating people to think 
that we are back in Bull Connor days. 
Well, if this is Jim Crow, then States 
like Delaware must be Jim Crow 2.0. 
Why is there not an outcry against 
Delaware? 
I will point out that Georgia has 
more permissive voting laws than Dela-
ware, more early voting days than 
Delaware, no-excuse absentee voting, 
which, by the way, the voters of New 
York recently rejected. Georgia now 
makes ballot drop boxes permanent, 
which was not the case before the pan-
demic. Much has been made about re-
stricting the number of drop boxes. I 
have been told that the one county 
pointed to is actually a ruby red Re-
publican county in which they dropped 
down to one. 
If this is being done for partisan ad-
vantage, my gosh, they are not doing a 
very good job of partisan maneuvering, 
but I would argue that this bill is a 
wonderful example of partisan maneu-
vering. 
What does it do? It is a Federal take-
over of elections. 
This innovation that the previous 
speaker, my colleague from California, 
was speaking of now has to run the 
gamut of a Federal official who says 
yea or who says nay. 
It funnels tax dollars to fund polit-
ical campaigns no matter how fringe 
that person’s perspective might be, 
who no self-respecting donor would 
give money to online or in person, but 
because of this law, my gosh, they have 
got a chance. 
It bans commonsense voter ID laws. 
Now, there is this kind of myth being 
promulgated that States are putting up 
these onerous laws that cannot be com-
plied with. Courts reject those laws. 
Courts do not allow a State to use a 
mandated picture ID, issued by the 
State, as an ID, and to say so is ma-
nipulative. It is manipulative in the 
worst way. Courts decide the threshold, 
and courts decide what is reasonable 
and is unreasonable, and to suggest 
otherwise one more time is an attempt 
to manipulate people into thinking 
that 2022 is 1965, with all of the impli-
cations thereof and all of the harm 
that does to our body politic. Shame. 
It also allows unlimited ballot har-
vesting—and, I think, California might 
be the only State to have it in place— 
where you go to a homeless shelter and 
have people sign up who might be ad-
dicted, mentally ill, brain damaged and 
have them sign for a certain candidate. 
Now, you can imagine a well-paid ac-
tivist—because this bill allows activ-
ists to be paid—might discard those 
ballots which are not for her candidate 
and keep only those for their own can-
didate. This bill requires that all 50 
States have it; whereas, in North Caro-
lina, they actually booted a candidate 
because he used ballot harvesting. 
It also prohibits States from cleaning 
up their voter rolls. Now, somehow, 
this is now wrong. I actually come 
from Louisiana, a State hit by Hurri-
cane Katrina in 2005. After 2005, it was 
a tragedy for my State, but we had 
tens of thousands of people who moved 
to other States. Now, at some point, 
they registered to vote in Atlanta or in 
Houston or in Dallas, and our secretary 
of state went back and said: Hmm, you 
are on a voter roll in Louisiana, and 
you are on a voter roll in Georgia. It 
appears that you are now paying taxes 
in Georgia. We are going to drop you 
from our rolls. 
Is anything wrong with that? Is any-
thing wrong with pointing out that 
somebody is registered to vote in two 
different States and then saying, ‘‘You 
are paying taxes there, so we are going 
to remove you from our rolls here’’? 
Lastly, I will say this: It puts Demo-
crats in charge of the FEC, a neutral 
organization enforcing voter laws. I 
can imagine, as soon as Republicans 
take charge again, we are going to do 
the same thing back to the other side. 
We are going to attempt to manipulate 
voting laws to our advantage, and it is 
not above either party to do that. So— 
I hate to use this word, but to sanc-
timoniously declare that this bill is the 
end of history; that partisanship is be-
hind us; that, by golly, these laws are 
going to be put in place, and forever 
after, we are going to live harmo-
niously, is to not understand Wash-
ington, DC, where every edge is sought, 
and whenever it is sought, it is ex-
ploited to keep your particular party 
in power. 
I say this as a Republican: I don’t 
trust my party any more than I trust 
their party. I trust the States and the 
courts to oversee them, but this bill 
usurps that responsibility. 
Now, you can say that maybe this 
power grab is merely in place to dis-
tract from real issues, and there is 
something to be said to that. We are 
debating this—whether or not to re-
quire all 50 States to allow ballot har-
vesting—when we have the highest rate 
of inflation than we have had in over 40 
years; when Russians are about to in-
vade Ukraine, apparently; when there 
are people pouring across our southern 
border and there is a looming humani-
tarian crisis in Afghanistan and the 
COVID response is kind of being caught 
up with, not being preemptively ad-
dressed, and we are discussing this. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. President, let me mention one 
more thing—the filibuster. 
I was in an interview today about the 
surprise medical billing bill. My col-
league from New Hampshire, who I 
think was in the Chamber earlier, 
helped to put that together. Multiple

S297 
January 19, 2022 
colleagues ended up coming together 
on that. It took us 2 to 3 years to get 
it done, the surprise medical billing. As 
of January 1 of this year, if you get a 
surprise medical bill, there is a 1–800 
number to call, and you get help. 
Why did it take us 2 years? We had to 
listen to stakeholders. We had to get 
legislation that works for all. We had 
to go to this Republican, that Demo-
crat, this committee in the Senate, 
that committee in the House; working 
with a broad coalition; even maybe, at 
the end, it slipping away; but we man-
aged to pull it together, and we passed 
surprise medical billing, and it was bet-
ter because of that process. 
Now, that is in contrast to a bill in 
which a majority of Democrats in the 
House and the Senate, with the Presi-
dent, can force through without any 
input from Republicans, from the 50 
percent of the United States that voted 
for the other side. Well, let’s guess 
whose advantage that bill is going to 
be for. It doesn’t take much to imag-
ine. 
What MITT ROMNEY said on the Sun-
day 
morning 
show—did the White 
House ever call you about this voting 
bill? MITT ROMNEY said: Never called 
me. That made it clear there was no ef-
fort to make this bipartisan. 
We are going to break this 200-year- 
old filibuster that requires us to come 
together to find common ground—that 
gives us bills that are stronger because 
of it—because of a desire for partisan 
advantage and knowing that once we 
break it and Republicans take it back, 
we are going to use it the same way. 
This is wrong. This is wrong for our 
country. It is wrong for our institution. 
I suppose that is why 16 of my Demo-
cratic colleagues signed a letter last 
year—when, by the way, Republicans 
were in control—saying that we should 
preserve the filibuster. 
It was recently stated that there is a 
disease of division infecting our coun-
try. That is true. And blowing up the 
filibuster removes one of the last 
things that make us come together. 
That is wrong, and that will be tragic, 
however—however—it is framed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I re-
quest a brief opportunity to respond 
since my name and my State were in-
voked by Senator CASSIDY on this—you 
have got to give Republicans points for 
creativity on their terminology—some 
type of ballot harvesting. Let me tell 
you specifically what he is referencing 
because, again, different States have 
different rules and different histories. 
In my speech, I talked about vote-by- 
mail. In California, we have seen the 
wisdom of every eligible voter auto-
matically receiving a ballot in the mail 
with multiple options for how to return 
their ballot, including in person if that 
is their choice, through the Postal 
Service if that is their choice, through 
ballot drop boxes if that is their choice. 
If, after all that—in-person early vot-
ing, election day, vote-by-mail, Postal 
Service, drop boxes—if, after all of 
that, a voter decides for themselves 
that they need or would like assistance 
with returning their ballot, that is the 
voter’s prerogative. 
Imagine that—asking a family mem-
ber, a neighbor, or a friend: Can you do 
me a favor? Can you make sure this 
gets to a mailbox or the polling place 
in time for my vote to be counted? 
Yes, there is a requirement in Cali-
fornia that if you are somebody assist-
ing a voter with returning their vote- 
by-mail ballot, you, too, have to sign 
that return envelope, the official re-
turn envelope, and your relationship 
with the voter—relative, friend, neigh-
bor, et cetera. 
Imagine that—empowering voters to 
decide for themselves how to return 
their ballot. That is what it is. They 
don’t call it ballot harvesting be-
cause—once again, what are Repub-
licans proving time and again they are 
interested in doing? Making it harder 
for eligible people to register to vote, 
stay registered to vote, and actually 
cast their ballot. 
I just wanted to clarify what it is 
that we are talking about here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the clarification from my col-
league from California. 
Mr. President, let me say what a 
privilege it is to have the opportunity 
to make this speech in front of you, the 
fifth longest serving Senator in the his-
tory of the U.S. Senate—somebody who 
has been in the Senate for 46 years. I 
was 11 when you came to the U.S. Sen-
ate, and I am not a young man any-
more. I am 57 years old. 
Mr. KING. You are young. 
Mr. BENNET. Somebody said: ‘‘You 
are young.’’ Only in the U.S. Senate 
would that be true. 
But I know the Presiding Officer, 
who is the chair of the important Ap-
propriations Committee, is retiring 
this year. I was sitting here as I was 
getting ready to speak, thinking that 
you have seen it all, Mr. President. 
You have seen it all. 
Unlike almost anybody else in this 
Chamber, you have actually seen a 
functioning U.S. Senate. You have seen 
the Senate where the floor was filled 
with people having a debate; where fili-
busters actually had to happen out in 
public, not in secret in a Senator’s of-
fice; where people were not spending 80 
percent of their time in call rooms 
fundraising instead of being out here 
on the floor doing the American peo-
ple’s business, as Senators will see; 
that actually passed important pieces 
of legislation that made a difference to 
the American people and made our 
country more competitive, made us 
stronger. You are one of the last people 
here who saw a Senate that worked 
like that. 
The Republican leader has been here 
long enough to have seen a Senate that 
worked like that. 
You were here, I am sure—I know 
you were, Mr. President—in 2006 when 
you were passing the Voting Rights 
Act here with 98 votes. Ninety-eight to 
zero the Voting Rights Act passed in 
2006. 
The Republican leader of the Senate 
then, the senior Senator from Ken-
tucky, Senator MCCONNELL, voted for 
that bill. It wasn’t even close, from his 
perspective. I have a number of quotes 
from him, but one was ‘‘The Voting 
Rights Act has proved to be a success 
for America’’ and has ‘‘brought about 
greater justice for all.’’ 
Amen, Leader MCCONNELL, taking 
that principled position in 2006. It was 
part of an honorable tradition that the 
Republican Party has had in this coun-
try going back really to Abraham Lin-
coln and the votes that were taken 
here to put Reconstruction in place, to 
fight the redeemers. It was true in 1965 
when they passed the Voting Rights 
Act by 77 to 19 on this floor. Lyndon 
Johnson could not have done that 
without Everett Dirksen, a Republican, 
the Republican leader, who was for 
that. 
As you know, I say to the Presiding 
Officer, because you saw it—you prob-
ably 
were 
there—four 
Republican 
Presidents—Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and 
George W. Bush—all signed versions of 
the Voting Rights Act. They showed 
the country every time they did it that 
there is nothing partisan about voting 
rights. 
Senator MCCONNELL said: 
[O]ur country will and must continue its 
progress toward a society in which every per-
son, of every background, can realize the 
American Dream. With the passage of the 
Voting Rights Act, we are reaffirming that 
Dream. 
He was right back then when he said 
that, but today, he is leading the 
blockade. 
There are 16 Republican Senators 
here who voted for the Voting Rights 
Act back then in 2006, and today, they 
are all part of this blockade. What has 
changed? What has changed? 
One of the things that changed was 
the Supreme Court’s decision in the 
Shelby case that eviscerated the Vot-
ing Rights Act by getting rid of 
preclearance for States that had his-
torically discriminated against Afri-
can-American people, among others. 
But do you know what is interesting 
about that, I say to the Presiding Offi-
cer? The Supreme Court said in that 
decision that Congress can fix this 
problem. We have a constitutional 
problem, but Congress can fix this 
problem. 
That is exactly the same thing they 
said, by the way, when they wrote that 
horrendous decision in Citizens United. 
They said that Congress can fix this 
problem. But they may not have de-
tected the paralysis that now exists— 
not in PAT LEAHY’s Senate from when 
the Presiding Officer got here but in 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s Senate today, in 
the modern-day Senate where people 
are willing to let a decision like Shelby

January 19, 2022 
just lie, not address it; where people 
are willing to accept a decision like 
Citizens United that says that we are 
going to let billionaires buy elections 
in this country instead of favoring peo-
ple’s right to vote. And we, the Con-
gress, won’t do anything about it even 
when the Supreme Court tells us we 
could do something about it. 
I think it is worth quoting the Noto-
rious RBG in her dissent in that case, 
in the Shelby case, when she said that 
‘‘throwing out preclearance when it 
has worked and is continuing to work 
to stop discriminatory changes is like 
throwing away your umbrella in a rain-
storm because you are not getting 
wet.’’ 
She was 100 percent right. State after 
State after State started to adopt re-
strictive voting statutes. 
Last July, the Supreme Court issued 
another opinion that makes it harder 
to challenge State laws that dispropor-
tionately hurt certain voters. 
By the way, none of this could have 
come at a worst time because we have 
a former President traversing the 
United States of America, perpetrating 
the Big Lie that he didn’t lose the elec-
tion, that the election was stolen from 
him, that Joe Biden is not the legiti-
mate President of the United States. 
There are politicians, I am sad to say, 
elected leaders all over this Nation, 
who are parroting—including in this 
Chamber—that Big Lie when they 
know that it is a lie, when they know 
that it is false, who are unwilling, as 
MITT ROMNEY said, to respect their own 
voters enough that they actually tell 
them the truth. 
In every State except one—I say to 
Senator LEAHY, it is your State, 
Vermont—in every State except yours, 
people are introducing legislation to 
take away the vote of other people. 
There are 500 such bills. 
Arizona has adopted changes that 
would purge up to 150,000 voters from 
the rolls. 
Montana has gotten rid of same-day 
voter registration to make it harder 
for students. 
Texas is down to one drop box per 
county. In Harris County, a county—I 
am sorry to say to my friend SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE—that is actually larger 
than Rhode Island, that means there is 
a drop box for 2.5 million voters. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you for 
using us as a unit of measure. 
Mr. BENNET. I am glad to use Rhode 
Island as a unit of measure. It is also 
smaller than a number of Colorado 
counties, but it has its charm. It has 
its charm. It has water, which we don’t 
have in the State of Colorado. 
But just let me say—because I am 
here with my colleague from Colorado 
who, when he was Governor, did a lot 
to make sure that people would have 
the right to vote in our State—in con-
trast to Houston, where there is 1 drop 
box, in my hometown of Denver, where 
there are 500,000 registered voters, we 
have 40 drop boxes in Denver. We are a 
lot smaller. We have 40 times the num-
ber of drop boxes that they have in 
Houston. 
After Georgia’s Republican secretary 
of state refused to buckle to President 
Trump’s demand to find, somehow, an-
other 11,000 votes—you remember the 
phone call. I am not making it up. You 
heard it with your own ears. 
He called him up, and he said: Well, 
find 11,000 votes. 
The guy said: No, I am not going to 
do that. 
Now the legislature has removed him 
from the State election board. 
So this isn’t just about making it 
harder for people to vote, although it is 
making it harder for people to vote; 
this is shoring up the soft spots that 
prevented Donald Trump from being 
able to assert, credibly, that somehow 
the election had been stolen from him. 
So 1 year after January 6 happened— 
1 year after this Capitol was invaded, 1 
year after there was a guy in horns 
standing up on the top of that Gallery 
behind me—the majority leader who 
once came to this floor to proclaim the 
importance of the Voting Rights Act is 
saying that this is all a ‘‘fake panic.’’ 
That is the language he used today. 
Boy, given what we are seeing in this 
country, if we ever needed him to sum-
mon the principle that he articulated 
or espoused in 2006, Mr. President, 
when you were here, it is now. It is 
now. That is an important principle to 
defend. 
So he comes to the floor today and 
says: I am going to defend the Senate. 
That is what I am here to do. I am here 
to defend the Senate. 
Let me say something that might of-
fend you, Mr. President. And I don’t 
mean to offend you, and I apologize if 
it offends you. But no one in America 
knows what the cloture rule is. No one. 
No one in America. My mom doesn’t 
know what the cloture rule is, and she 
is a pretty close watcher of the Senate. 
No one knows what the cloture rule is. 
No one in America knows, I would as-
sert, what the filibuster is. But let me 
tell you what it is—not what it says; 
what it is. It is a rule that was created 
to let 60 Senators cut off debate so 51 
Senators could make a decision that 
has been warped into a rule that allows 
41 Senators to stop any debate and pre-
vent the Senate from ever having a 
vote. 
That is what the cloture rule is. That 
is not what it says, but that is what it 
is, which is why every time you turn 
your television set on at home, you see 
a crawl at the bottom of your screen 
that says ‘‘Quorum Call,’’ and you 
can’t find a U.S. Senator anywhere be-
cause they are probably back in a 
phone booth making fundraising phone 
calls. 
Until this century, there was vir-
tually not any filibuster used. 
By the way, I should say how much I 
appreciate Senator THUNE coming to 
the floor here today and saying that 
President Trump lost the election. I 
appreciate it. I really do. He is an hon-
orable person. 
But it is important to know that one 
place the filibuster does not exist is in 
the U.S. Constitution. For most of the 
country’s history, we never had the fil-
ibuster. It was almost never used until 
the modern era. 
When I got here in President Obama’s 
first 
term, 
the 
Republican 
leader, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, used the filibuster a 
record number of times. He filibustered 
everything in his attempt to first make 
Barack Obama a one-term President 
and then basically to bring down his 
Presidency. 
He came out to the floor the other 
day and he said: ‘‘Sometimes the effect 
of the filibuster is to block bills out-
right.’’ 
Sometimes? 
Sometimes? 
It 
happens all the time. This is why we 
never do anything. This is why we 
can’t make decisions. This is why we 
can’t even have debates. 
The American people have no idea 
whom to blame. They don’t know be-
cause no one in America knows what 
the cloture rule is. And when they 
elect a majority and they expect things 
to get done, they don’t get done. 
Senator MCCONNELL argues that the 
filibuster ‘‘gives all kinds of citizens 
and all kinds of States a meaningful 
voice in nearly everything we do.’’ We 
have heard that over and over again 
today—the voice that somehow we are 
shutting out. 
I haven’t met anybody who thinks 
that their voice is meaningfully rep-
resented in the U.S. Senate instead of 
special interests or the most powerful 
people—nobody—and it is because we 
can’t have a debate on anything they 
care about. 
Take background checks. Eighty-four 
percent of voters, including 77 percent 
of Republicans, support them. We can’t 
even have a debate on the floor. 
Let Medicare negotiate drug prices 
on behalf of people. Seventy-seven per-
cent of the American people support 
that. We can’t even have a debate here. 
Seventy-four percent of people sup-
port the Dreamers—something Senator 
DURBIN has been working on for a mil-
lion years since you have been here? 
Mr. DURBIN. Two million. 
Mr. BENNET. And we can’t get a 
vote on that. 
The Freedom to Vote Act. Seventy 
percent of all voters, including 54 per-
cent of Republicans, support it. 
All of them have been blocked by 
Senator MCCONNELL and his abuse of 
the Senate rules—not some great, ven-
erable tradition of the U.S. Senate but 
his modern-day abuse, his caricature of 
the Senate rules. And it has created a 
minority 
veto—something 
that 
the 
Founders of this country would never 
ever in a million years have imagined 
that this place would be perverted into. 
They knew the trouble that would 
cause because they had had the Arti-
cles of Confederation, which is what 
they were trying to replace at the Con-
stitutional Convention. 
I am coming to an end, so I apologize 
to colleagues. But let me just say, none 
of this has stopped us from cutting

taxes by $8 trillion, mostly for the 
wealthiest people in this country, and 
none of this has stopped us from put-
ting lots of rightwing judges on the 
court when Donald Trump was here be-
cause you can do those things with 51 
votes. That is about the extent of Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s legislative agenda, 
so I am not surprised that he prefers 
the status quo. But for the majority of 
Americans who believe that the next 
generation actually demands some-
thing greater than that from the Sen-
ate and from all of us, from each of us, 
we need a Senate that works. 
Mr. President, think about this. 
Think about this. It is easy to forget. 
The Clean Water Act of 1972 passed 74 
to 0. 
By the way, I worked with the Sen-
ator from Louisiana on that surprise 
medical bill. I am proud of that bill, 
but it is not the Clean Water Act of 
1972. 
The Americans With Disabilities Act 
of 1990, 91 to 6; the children’s health in-
surance plan, 85 to 15 in 1997; com-
prehensive 
immigration 
reform—we 
were part of that effort—68 votes in the 
Senate before it completely collapsed 
into smithereens; and, of course, the 
reauthorization of the Voting Rights 
Act. Does anybody think—Mr. Presi-
dent, do you think that any of those 
bills would pass with a bipartisan ma-
jority like that today? Not a single 
one. We wouldn’t even get to the vote. 
We are still on a temporary budget. I 
don’t need to tell you, the chairman of 
the Appropriations Committee, that we 
haven’t passed any of the 12 appropria-
tions bills this year. We have taken 
three times as long to confirm Presi-
dent Biden’s nominees—103 days—com-
pared to President Reagan. This is no 
way to compete in the world, Mr. 
President. This is no way to compete 
with the Chinese Government’s totali-
tarian approach to humanity. 
I know we can compete, but we have 
to restore the Senate, and the most 
basic part of our job is protecting the 
right to vote. That is why we are here. 
Every American should be able to vote 
like we do in Colorado, thanks to my 
colleague 
from 
Colorado, 
Senator 
HICKENLOOPER, and what he did when 
he was Governor. 
As Dr. King said, ‘‘The history of our 
Nation is the history of a long and tire-
less effort to broaden . . . the franchise 
of American citizens.’’ That is what 
this bill is about—to broaden the fran-
chise of American citizens. 
If we look back at our history, this is 
only the latest example of how the 
Senate has impeded American progress, 
and it wouldn’t be the first time that 
the Senate rules were changed in re-
sponse to that. 
Before the Civil War—a time even be-
fore you were in the Senate, Mr. Presi-
dent—the Senate sheltered the minor-
ity interests of slaveholders on this 
floor. After the war, it enabled monop-
olists and robber barons and isolation-
ists to profit from the misery of the 
conflict and its aftermath. 
Each time in our country’s history, 
crises forced the Senate to fundamen-
tally change the way it worked, and 
each change has led to meaningful 
progress, including clearing the way 
for the passage of the 14th and 15th 
Amendments to emancipate and en-
franchise former slaves, sweeping anti-
trust reforms, and long-delayed legisla-
tion to protect civil rights. 
The bottom line is that the Senate 
rules are not suspended in amber, espe-
cially when they are being abused the 
way they are being abused today. They 
can and they always have changed with 
the times. 
Finally, let me say this: As we con-
sider these reforms, the last thing we 
should do is make another House of 
Representatives. That is not what I 
want to do. I want to have a Senate 
where you have to come out here and 
debate; where you can’t filibuster in se-
cret in your office but you have to be 
out here to persuade the American peo-
ple of the righteousness of your cause; 
where the minority has the right to 
offer amendments; and where, in the 
end, 51 Senators can actually make a 
decision so that we can move this 
country forward and so that each one 
of us, whether we are in the majority 
today or sometime in the minority, can 
live under the rules that we have con-
structed to make the Senate actually 
function for the American people. 
That, Mr. President, I think is why 
most of us have been sent here, and it 
is what I hope we are going to accom-
plish today. If we don’t, we have to 
keep fighting. 
The Senator from Louisiana men-
tioned that this isn’t 1965. Let me end 
by saying this: The economic gap be-
tween White Americans and Black 
Americans is as great today as it was 
in 1968. That is a brutal fact about the 
state of our economy, and it is why we 
need a Senate that actually can re-
spond to the needs of the American 
people. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank you 
for your patience and your indulgence. 
I apologize that you are having to con-
sume part of your last year listening to 
a yearslong speech. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, to 
hear the other side talk—by ‘‘the other 
side,’’ I mean the Democrats—they 
would never dream of questioning our 
democratic process. So I want to take 
you back in history just a little ways 
to just before the 2020 election. 
Let’s not forget the outlandish con-
spiracy theory promoted by leading 
Democrats in the runup to the 2020 
election that somehow the Postal Serv-
ice might not deliver absentee ballots. 
Postmaster General DeJoy was slan-
dered and slandered disgracefully based 
on no evidence whatsoever of any 
wrongdoing. The Postmaster is hired 
by the Board of Governors of the Post-
al Service. He was neither appointed by 
President Trump, nor did he answer to 
President Trump. The fact that DeJoy 
had supported President Trump’s elec-
tion was just enough for the other side 
to concoct a highly implausible elec-
tion-tampering plot. 
Now, after the election of President 
Biden, we heard no more about the 
problems of the Postal Service maybe 
not delivering mail. The necessary 
business transformation initiated by 
Postmaster General DeJoy to make 
sure that the ballots did arrive to be 
counted on time—that business trans-
formation resumed after an election 
pause to allay irrational fears stirred 
up by partisans. We have heard pre-
cious little about this alleged threat to 
democracy since the election. Now, had 
the election gone differently, I suspect 
that we would have heard a lot more. 
However, the effect of that scare tac-
tic still lingers to this very day. Along 
that line, I hear from Iowans who 
dropped off their absentee ballots for 
the first time, scared that their vote 
would not have been counted if mailed 
because of that conspiracy theory 
against DeJoy that somehow the Post-
al Service was going to make sure a 
Democrat ballot didn’t get delivered. 
My State of Iowa is one of the few 
States that use the Postal Service’s In-
telligent bar code on ballot envelopes. 
That helps the Postal Service expedite 
the ballots and allows Iowans to track 
their ballot until it is delivered to the 
county auditors. Iowans continue to be 
able to vote absentee with great con-
fidence that their vote will count. 
So it makes me very sad that some 
were convinced otherwise as part of a 
political con game prior to the 2020 
election. This denigrating of our elec-
tion process for short-term political 
gain is disgraceful. 
Now, I see the current false claims 
about State laws suppressing votes in 
the same light. Whether Democrats be-
lieve their own talking points or 
whether it is a cynical attempt to 
paint Republicans as anti-voting, these 
false claims undermine faith in the de-
mocracy. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
would like to go back a little further in 
history than last year’s warmed-over 
conspiracy theories that we just heard 
my friend from Iowa talk about. 
I so appreciated Senator BENNET’s 
discussion of sort of the history of vot-
ing rights and the history of this body. 
The American public certainly doesn’t 
know what cloture means. The Amer-
ican public really doesn’t know all that 
much about the filibuster either. 
But go back a few decades. The fili-
buster was used to suppress the vote. 
The filibuster was used by many people 
in my political party—back when too 
many Democrats were on the wrong 
side of history and the wrong side of 
civil rights—was used by southern seg-
regationists. It was finally overcome 
by some northern Republicans, with a 
whole bunch of northern Democrats.

But think about what else the fili-
buster has been used for. The filibuster 
was used in the 1970s and 1980s to pro-
tect Big Tobacco in Kentucky. The fili-
buster was used to protect Big Oil. 
Now, it is used to protect Wall Street. 
The filibuster is used to protect big 
tech companies. The filibuster is used 
in case after case after case to protect 
big drug companies. So we know that 
the whole purpose of the filibuster has 
been to protect the most affluent, the 
most privileged, the wealthiest cor-
porate interests in this society that 
just get their way in this body day 
after day, week after week, month 
after month, year after year. 
Now, this weekend—and many re-
ferred to this—we honored Dr. Martin 
Luther King. We heard a lot of words 
extolling his legacy. Those words from 
many who are for whatever reason not 
supporting voting rights today—those 
words sounded pretty empty. 
Few people told the story of Dr. King 
in Memphis, why Dr. King was in Mem-
phis. 
In early February of 1968, sanitation 
workers in Memphis—some of the most 
abused, taken-advantage-of workers in 
our country; mostly Black workers 
doing a dirty, difficult job in a seg-
regated city with a very racist mayor, 
who let that be known in the ensuing 
months—these sanitation workers were 
not even given rest periods, particu-
larly when they were in White neigh-
borhoods. There was nowhere to go 
when they were picking up the garbage 
in White neighborhoods. There was no 
place to go for the rest periods. 
Two workers in early February, in a 
rainstorm, got in their garbage trucks 
to protect themselves from the rain for 
a few minutes. The garbage truck mal-
functioned. Those two workers—under-
paid, with no real benefits and no in-
surance and no help for their families— 
those two workers were killed. 
Dr. King went to Memphis the first 
time to help lead that strike, to join 
the striking workers. The second time 
he went back, that is when he was as-
sassinated. 
Dr. King understood that the dignity 
of work was intertwined with voting 
rights. Worker rights and voting rights 
always went together. Dr. King in-
sisted that no job is menial if it pays a 
decent wage. Those sanitations work-
ers, as I said—low wages, no benefits, 
no health insurance, no retirement— 
none of that—and few days off. 
Dr. King said: 
What does it profit a man to be able to eat 
at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn’t 
earn enough money to buy a hamburger and 
a cup of coffee? 
He talked about the dignity of 
work—a term mostly popularized by 
him—and he said no work is menial if 
it pays an adequate wage. 
Until all workers have dignity in the 
job, Dr. King’s work will remain unfin-
ished. We can’t get there if workers 
cannot vote. I don’t mean just workers 
who put on a tie and sit at a desk; the 
vote should be open to everyone—I 
mean all workers, whether you punch a 
clock, whether you swipe a badge, 
whether you work for tips, whether you 
are on salary, whether you are raising 
children, whether you are taking care 
of aging parents. 
We know who powers our economy. It 
is workers. It is not the rich donors and 
the corporate contributors who fund 
the politicians who are pushing for ger-
rymandering and voter suppression in 
the takeovers of local election borders; 
it is workers. 
I think about what we did in the Sen-
ate last week—with some difficulty, 
but ultimately, it worked. We unani-
mously passed a resolution honoring 
the custodians and the maintenance 
workers. We had talked often about the 
police officers, some of whom gave 
their lives and dozens who were in-
jured, all who were courageous. We 
honored them, as we should. We also, 
last week, though, passed a resolution 
honoring custodial workers and main-
tenance workers. They get little rec-
ognition. They work for too low pay. 
Last January, 1 year ago, these work-
ers—largely Black and Brown workers, 
many of them immigrants—were forced 
to clean feces off the wall, clean up 
after the destruction of the White su-
premacists, and restore dignity to our 
Capitol after domestic terrorists ran-
sacked it. The insurrectionists de-
stroyed; the Black and Brown workers 
cleaned up. The carpenters and the 
maintenance workers and the painters 
union members all rebuilt. Last week, 
we came together to honor their serv-
ice. They deserve more than words, 
more than gratitude. 
So often, they and other working 
people don’t have much of a voice in 
this country. They don’t have the high- 
priced lobbyists who come here. Many 
of you have looked down the hall and 
seen, in front of Senator MCCONNELL’s 
office—you have seen the lobbyists 
lined up, who always seem to get what 
they come for. Workers don’t have cor-
porate lobbyists. They aren’t going on 
campaign donor retreats. But workers 
have the vote or should have the vote. 
The voting booth is where all of us 
are supposed to have an equal voice. 
The voting booth is where workers are 
supposed to be able to go to hold the 
wealthy and the powerful accountable. 
So it is not surprising that politicians 
who pass corporate tax cuts—the same 
politicians who do the handouts for the 
wealthiest 1 percent—don’t want lots 
of workers to vote. 
We know whom voter suppression 
and election subversion is aimed at. It 
is at the parents working two jobs to 
pay the rent and make sure their kids 
have a decent meal, with no control 
over their work lives and their work 
hours if they don’t have a collective 
bargaining agreement. It is students. It 
is people who don’t get a day off. It is 
seniors in nursing homes. It is home 
healthcare workers who care for them. 
So often, these are women of color, 
working the graveyard shift after com-
ing straight from their second job. 
We know whose votes these politi-
cians want to throw out after they are 
cast. We know which cities the former 
President went after. One is Philadel-
phia, PA, Senator CASEY; and Atlanta, 
GA, Senators OSSOFF
and WARNOCK. 
What do they have in common? They 
are diverse places with a whole lot of 
Black and Brown workers who cast bal-
lots that the rich and powerful don’t 
like. 
Ultimately, as others have said, it 
comes down to this: These politicians 
want to cherry-pick their voters rather 
than the voters picking their elected 
officials. 
Through 
gerrymandering, 
through voter suppression, and through 
meddling in local election boards, poli-
ticians want to pick and choose whose 
votes are counted. 
President Trump carried my State 
twice by 8 points. My State, though, is 
about a 53, 54, 46, 47—slightly Repub-
lican State now. For the last decade, 
the Members of Congress in my State— 
12 Republicans and 4 Democrats in 2012, 
in 2014, in 2016, in 2018, and 2020. None 
of that changed. Not one of those dis-
tricts changed because Republicans, 
with their corruption and with their 
skill at drawing maps, drew those maps 
in ways that there were no real fair 
elections. 
We know whose votes they don’t 
want to count. It is the votes of the 
low-paid and the overlooked; the votes 
of workers who power this country yet 
don’t have much power; the votes of 
people who might hold politicians ac-
countable, who might demand fewer 
tax cuts for rich people and an increase 
in the child tax credit and the earned- 
income tax credit, the largest tax cut 
for families in our Nation’s history. 
Ninety percent of families in Colo-
rado, in Georgia, in New Jersey, in 
Ohio, and all over this country—90 per-
cent of families with children get at 
least a $3,000 tax cut because of what 
we did in this body when we said: No 
more Republican freight trains car-
rying tax cuts down the track. We are 
going to give tax cuts to moderate-in-
come people and working families. 
The votes of people who hold politi-
cians accountable, the votes of people 
who understand the dignity of work—if 
you say you support American work-
ers, you support their right to vote. 
I ask my colleagues of both parties to 
come together to protect the right of 
every American to have a voice in this 
country no matter who you are, no 
matter where you work, no matter 
where you live. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I did 
not intend to speak today. I came down 
here and listened to the speeches of 
some of my colleagues for 2 hours this 
morning and asked for an opportunity 
to get on the list of what are nearly 50 
Senators who are going to speak today. 
But I heard loud and clear some of the 
comments. I just wanted to go back 
and revisit them and talk about maybe

S301 
January 19, 2022 
the path forward after this vote occurs 
today and, I hope, fails to change the 
filibuster rule. 
I think Senator TESTER was the one 
who said he knew of a voter who waited 
8 to 10 hours to vote. That is unaccept-
able. We need to change that. 
I would also say that probably over 
that 8 to 10 hours, they run a long 
line—far beyond any restrictions they 
had for electioneering—so they could 
have food and water. 
Some people could have heard that 
speech and thought that someone was 
starving or thirsting to death for 8 or 
10 hours, but we all know that most 
States have laws that allow anyone to 
provide food or water to others 50 feet 
away from the election sites. 
I know if you have ever been in elec-
tions, you have been there too. I have 
been there handing out my push card, 
50 feet out, handing people water. That 
happens every day. The American peo-
ple need to know that. And if there are 
States that have restrictions, that is 
something I hope I have a moment to 
talk about as we move forward. 
We also heard Senator KLOBUCHAR 
say that, 160 times, the rules have 
changed. The fact of the matter is, 
they have never changed for the legis-
lative calendar, which is what we are 
talking about, without regular order. 
It happened seven times, and it hap-
pened because the majority of Mem-
bers, 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans, 
thought that we should modernize the 
rules. But we did it through regular 
order. It has never been done before. 
In fact, in two notable examples 
where the nuclear option was used was 
once by then-Majority Leader Harry 
Reid and followed up by then-Majority 
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL. If that is 
not the best indicator of what will hap-
pen to this body, nothing is. 
Remember when Senator Reid said: 
We are just going to carve out a little 
bit of the Executive Calendar to make 
it easier for district judges to get con-
firmed. That is all we are going to do. 
Why on Earth does anybody believe 
that that carve-out wasn’t going to re-
sult in the ultimate nuclear option for 
the Executive Calendar? That is why 
you have Justice Gorsuch, Justice 
Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett. That 
is why you have it. This is the political 
physics here. For every action, there is 
an equal and opposite reaction. 
And if you vote to nuke the legisla-
tive filibuster, you might as well build 
a wall straight down this body because 
anytime Democrats or Republicans hit 
the trifecta and we have the White 
House and we have the Senate and we 
have the House, the minority’s voice 
will count for nothing. And, even 
worse, the voices of the vocal minority 
at either end of the political spectrum 
will have a disproportionate impact on 
what we vote on and pass out of this 
body. 
If you think it is hard getting the 
voting rights bills passed today, just 
think how hard it is going to be for you 
to stand down your most extreme 
base—we have got our own—on things 
that are not good for this country that 
the vast majority of the American peo-
ple will not support. We will go to an 
every 2-year or 4-year cycle of huge 
swings for the first time ever in this 
Nation’s history. 
I hope that last week most of you 
had the opportunity—I was in the 
Chamber, but if you weren’t, I would 
ask you to go back and listen to Sen-
ator SINEMA’s speech. Some people 
would have just spiked the football on 
our side of the aisle saying: It looks 
like she will preserve the filibuster. We 
can move on. 
What I heard was a Member calling 
on us to bridge the gap and make 
progress. That is what I heard. And on 
voting rights, I think we can. I think 
the American people need to know that 
if this fails today, it is not the end of 
the discussion of progress we need to 
make. 
My staff said: We don’t want you to 
put this board up because we are afraid 
that will tip your hand on things you 
are having discussions on. 
I have had a number of discussions 
with Members on the other side of the 
aisle. We have legitimate problems 
that we need to fix. We need to make it 
harder to cheat and easier to vote. We 
need to reform the Electoral Count 
Act. With all due respect to the major-
ity leader, I think that he said it is un-
acceptable and insufficient and even of-
fensive, because he said: ‘‘Scorekeeping 
matters little if the game is rigged.’’ 
‘‘If the game is rigged’’—that sounds 
like what President Trump was saying 
just about 18 months ago. Now, we have 
both sides of the aisle talking about 
how ‘‘the game is rigged.’’ 
What we are doing is creating more 
discontent, and we are actually sup-
pressing people’s interest in voting be-
cause they think their vote won’t 
count. That is what is being said in 
this Chamber today. That is what we 
have to stop. There are a number of 
things that we can do. 
I voted against all of the objections 
of my seven Republican colleagues on 
January 6. I stand by proud. I was 
proud to certify that election. But 
since 2001, the Electoral Count Act has 
been weaponized. You had 14 House 
Members object in 2021. You had 31 
House Members and a Senate Member 
object in 2005. You had 7 House Mem-
bers object in 2017. And we had 138 
House Members and 7 Senate Members 
object in this last election. It has 
clearly become weaponized. We clearly 
have to make it clear that the Vice 
President is in a ministerial position, 
and there should be a higher bar for 
lodging an objection. 
There are other things that we can 
do. The certifying agencies across the 
States should say: You can’t change 
the rules after the election is held. 
That is what we should be talking 
about. We should be talking about 
making it easier to vote. 
I don’t know why New York rejected, 
by a 58-to-42 margin, same-day reg-
istration last year, but they did. The 
voters went to the polls. And I am re-
minded of you saying the legislature 
overturned it. So now, it is the legisla-
ture in New York that is going to over-
turn 58 percent against same-day reg-
istration and 54 percent against no-ex-
cuse absentee ballot? 
I have got no-excuse absentee ballots 
in North Carolina. I think we should 
encourage more States to do the same. 
So where does this need to head? 
After tensions cool and after what I 
hope is a failed vote to change the 
rules—and, incidentally, the day that 
Republicans change the rule for the 
legislative filibuster is the day I resign 
from the Senate. And I believe that I 
have a number of Members on my side 
of the aisle that would never do it. So 
you don’t have to worry about the ar-
gument, ‘‘If you don’t change it now, 
they will change it when they hit the 
trifecta.’’ It is not going to happen. 
Senator KAINE, I think I was naive. 
When I signed that letter—after Presi-
dent Trump called for nuking the fili-
buster 34 times—I said: Get me on the 
letter to preserve the filibuster. 
I went home, and I was attacked. I 
have had the protesters. I have had the 
censure proposals in county GOPs and 
State GOPs. And I stand by it and I 
will stand by it as long as I am here. 
But I have to say I feel a little bit dis-
appointed and a little bit betrayed by 
the fact that the 32 Members who 
signed it on the Democratic side, all 
but one now say, Well, things have 
changed. They haven’t changed. And 
we can’t let this filibuster change. We 
need to work on making it easier to 
vote. We need to work on making it 
harder to cheat. 
There are reasonable solutions that I 
think most sides of the aisle can agree 
to. And the American people need to 
know that there are people like me and 
other Members that are going to fight 
for that after this vote hopefully goes 
down today. 
Let’s not build a wall between our 
Chamber. Let’s continue the relation-
ships that we have. I had five conversa-
tions with Members on the other side 
of the aisle this morning, talking about 
legislation we are working on, a visit 
to North Carolina to spend some time 
together outside of the political caul-
dron that we are in here now, helping 
somebody out with a vote in Judiciary 
for a judicial nominee that you other-
wise may be inclined to vote against. 
But let me tell you what. If you want 
to destroy that opportunity moving 
forward, vote to nuke the filibuster; 
vote to have any rational basis for 
working with Members when one of us 
hits the trifecta. 
But I do hope, after this vote fails 
today, that Members will answer the 
call to fix what is wrong with our sys-
tem, fix the Electoral Count Act, make 
it easier to vote and harder to cheat.

S302 
January 19, 2022 
a few minutes about vote-by-mail. I 
think Senator KLOBUCHAR will prob-
ably be joining me. 
Madam President and colleagues, I 
am the first U.S. Senator to be elected 
completely by mail. The second U.S. 
Senator elected completely by mail 
was my friend, Republican Gordon 
Smith, a Senator well known to many 
here in this body. 
The country looked up and its first 
experience, colleagues, with vote-by- 
mail was thoroughly bipartisan—one 
Democrat, one Republican, who, as it 
happened, after running against each 
other, got along very well and did a lot 
together. 
As the country began to get its arms 
around vote-by-mail, it was bipartisan 
and the bipartisan efforts to build on it 
really took off. They took off all across 
the country until President Donald 
Trump got elected and began to spew 
all these lies about vote-by-mail. So 
then something that was completely 
bipartisan suddenly became very par-
tisan. What I want to do is rebuild that 
bipartisanship. My colleagues seem to 
say that is what they want. And the 
fact is, vote-by-mail is the gold stand-
ard for casting an informed vote, par-
ticularly for working people, seniors, 
and others, who would like the time, 
the opportunity in their living rooms 
and their kitchens, to look at the bal-
lot and consider the various alter-
natives. 
And in that effort now to undo the 
damage done by Donald Trump to vote- 
by-mail and in the name of restoring 
bipartisanship, which is what it is all 
about—and I can just tell my col-
leagues, our late secretary of state, 
Dennis Richardson, used to say he was 
about the most conservative person 
who ever lived. He basically told Don-
ald Trump to go fly a kite when it 
came to vote-by-mail. Dennis Richard-
son, our late secretary of state, a 
staunch conservative, said the reality 
is there hadn’t been fraud; it worked 
very effectively. You are off base. 
So in the hope of being able to re-
store that bipartisanship, I want to ask 
a question of the distinguished chair of 
the Rules Committee. Then, I will wrap 
up very quickly, and we can move on. 
But we have had an awful lot of revi-
sionist history with respect to vote-by- 
mail. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR, I know the 
Rules Committee, under your leader-
ship, has dug into the history. Utah— 
bright red Utah—votes by mail. Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR, take us through that 
history and then I will close. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Sen-
ator WYDEN. 
I want to thank you. Oregon was the 
first to use vote-by-mail for a Federal 
election. Although, I think Senator 
PADILLA, a great member of the Rules 
Committee from California, would tell 
you, in fact, that California and Wash-
ington first allowed any voter to re-
quest a mail-in ballot in the 1970s. 
But since then, what has happened? 
Utah, considered a red State by all ac-
counts has mail-in balloting for nearly 
all of their voters. We have seen this 
across the country. 
Today, 34 States allow any voter to 
request a mail-in ballot. During the 
pandemic, 45 States actually allowed 
this to happen without an excuse. What 
happened during the pandemic is that 
we saw 11 States that didn’t typically 
allow all voters to request a mail-in 
ballot do so. 
Sadly, 10 of them have already start-
ed rolling this back for the next elec-
tion. We know that this is a really safe 
and good way to vote, whether there is 
a pandemic or there isn’t a pandemic. 
And the key is voters got used to it, 
they liked it, and attempts to roll this 
back and to make it harder to vote are 
the wrong way to go for our country. 
And, instead, we should be assuring 
everyone that regardless of their ZIP 
Code, regardless of their State, they 
should be able to vote by mail. 
Thank you for the question. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let 
me close very quickly. 
The fact is, we can bring about the 
bipartisanship that many of my Repub-
lican colleagues have been talking 
about over the last 41⁄2 hours. It is do-
able. It is possible to do it in a way 
that builds on a practical gold standard 
for informed voting used in Oregon, 
used in bright-red Utah, and it is what 
we had until 2020, when Donald Trump 
tried to preempt the progress we were 
making because, in every rally, he 
would talk about all this fraud, for ex-
ample. Fraud, Madam President—the 
last analysis of fraud in Oregon is 
0.00001 percent of all votes cast. 
So we can get back to what the Re-
publicans have been talking about over 
the last 41⁄2 hours, but the way you are 
going to have to do it is they are going 
to have to go to Donald Trump and tell 
him: Look, we just don’t agree with 
you on this. 
And that is the kind of leadership 
that we need. We saw it in Oregon. We 
saw it in Utah. We have seen it now 
from sea to shining sea. That is what it 
is going to take. 
I want my Republican colleagues to 
know that we will meet them more 
than half way, but they are going to 
have 
to 
start 
taking 
on 
Donald 
Trump’s lies on these issues if we are 
going to have that bipartisanship that 
my colleagues have been talking about 
this morning. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, this past weekend is our annual 
reminder as a country of the courage, 
suffering, sacrifice, passion, love, and 
energy that so many of our fellow 
Americans put into protecting our de-
mocracy. 
When in a democracy, one group of 
citizens can deliberately, purposefully 
make it more difficult for another 
group of citizens to vote, they have put 
a dagger into that democracy. We can-
not let that happen. 
I am here today to focus, in par-
ticular, on one voting right that we 
have in this country, and that voting 
right is, when you are voting, to know 
what the hell is going on around you in 
that election, to know who is saying 
what, to know who the players are 
around you. If we are supposed to sit 
here, as Americans, and just act like 
indolent consumers, passive in this de-
mocracy, that is not the way it is sup-
posed to work. Citizenship is an office, 
and that office has duties, and the du-
ties include being informed of what is 
going on around you. 
And what is stopping American citi-
zens from knowing what is going on 
around them is the cascade, the tor-
rent, the Nile River of dark money that 
has begun to flow into our democracy 
since Citizens United. 
It wasn’t enough that the Republican 
Members of the Court let unlimited 
money flow. They then had to refuse to 
react when that unlimited dark money 
went underground, when it went dark, 
when it became anonymous. 
They have had chance after chance to 
fix it and they refuse and we are left 
with this mess. It matters that citizens 
know who is talking in a democracy. 
In my circuit, the First Circuit Court 
of Appeals—where JACK
REED
and I 
have the honor, occasionally, to rec-
ommend nominees to the President— 
there is a judge who I believe is the 
dean of the First Circuit Court of Ap-
peals named Bruce Selya. He is a 
Rhode Islander. He was a Reagan ap-
pointee. He is a Republican. He is a 
very distinguished judge. And he has 
said: It is crucial that the electorate 
can understand who is speaking and, 
thus, to give proper weight to different 
speakers and messages when deciding 
how to vote. 
That crucial right is denied to Amer-
icans wholesale because of an unprece-
dented dark money campaign of inter-
ference in our democracy. 
You see it whenever it is election 
season. You are watching a television 
show and suddenly your TV screen is 
occupied by an advertisement that 
tells you that somebody is a bum, that 
somebody is no good, that somebody is 
terrible, that smears them. And at the 
end it says, ‘‘This advertisement was 
brought to you by Americans for peace 
and puppies and prosperity,’’ some 
completely imaginary group that was 
cooked up just to launch those adver-
tisements, and whatever filth those ad-
vertisements 
contain 
is 
then 
dis-
appeared with the end of that front 
group. 
It is the political equivalent of toilet 
paper. You flush it when you are done 
with the filth, and whoever is behind it 
keeps their hands clean. 
So we now have a tsunami of slime— 
as one writer put it—flowing through 
our country, and it is denying our citi-
zens the most fundamental right they 
have when they vote, which is to know 
who the actors are and who is doing 
what to whom. 
Well, in this bill is the DISCLOSE 
Act that would fix that. If you spend 
more than 10 grand in an election, you

have to report it. And I don’t care how 
many shell corporations and donors 
trusts and phony 501(c)(4)s you line up 
to blockade your identity, our bill will 
get through it. 
It superdrills through however many 
screens you put up, and the American 
public will, at last, once again, know 
who is really talking to them in their 
elections. Dark money takes away vot-
ers’ rights to know who is talking to 
them and what is going on in their de-
mocracy. It is a fundamental right. 
And, unfortunately, it doesn’t end 
there because the other rights that my 
colleagues have so eloquently talked 
about—to get to the ballot, to be treat-
ed fairly at the ballot, to not be har-
assed on the way to the ballot, to be 
able to get a ballot mailed to you—the 
Republican efforts around the country 
to attack those rights, to suppress 
votes those ways, do you know how 
that is being done? It is being done 
with dark money. 
We know it because they have been 
caught. It is not a matter of debate or 
dispute. When these enterprises are set 
up to deprive—what Reverend Warnock 
calls ‘‘some people’’—some people of 
their right to vote, and when the laws 
are done so that that is accomplished 
against, 
particularly, 
African-Amer-
ican voters with what one court called 
‘‘surgical precision,’’ that is not hap-
pening at random. It is happening be-
cause enormous amounts of anonymous 
money are flowing into groups to make 
it happen. 
And I will close with two examples. 
One is called Heritage Action, which 
is—the current state of the art on this 
is you set up a phony 501(c)(3) and a 
phony 501(c)(4), and they are a pair. 
And the money to the 501(c)(3) is de-
ductible, and the political dirty work is 
done by the 501(c)(4). 
And Heritage Foundation, which we 
have all heard about, is the 501(c)(3), 
and Heritage Action is its 501(c)(4). And 
Heritage Action was recorded talking 
to its secret donors. 
And the person who was making the 
presentation to the secret donors in 
April of 2021 said: 
We worked quietly with the . . . legisla-
ture. We got the best practices to them. We 
helped draft the bills. We made sure activists 
were calling the state legislators, getting 
support, showing up at their public hearings, 
giving testimony. 
In some cases, we actually [drafted the 
bills] for them or we have a sentinel— 
Think about that word for a minute, 
a ‘‘sentinel’’— 
on our behalf give them the model legisla-
tion so it has that grassroots, from-the-bot-
tom-up type of vibe. 
She said: And we did this with ‘‘little 
fanfare. Honestly, nobody even noticed. 
My team looked at each other and 
we’re like, ‘It can’t be that easy.’’’ 
Well, the DISCLOSE Act will stop it 
from being that easy to have an out-of- 
state, dark money campaign take a 
State legislature and get them to pass 
voter suppression laws without the 
State legislatures even knowing who is 
behind them. And that is on tape. I am 
not making this up. 
The other one that is always worth 
looking at are our friends at the Hon-
est Elections Project, which actually 
doesn’t exist. What exists is something 
called the 85 Fund. And the 85 Fund is 
allowed, under Virginia law, Senator 
KAINE, to have a fictitious name and to 
operate as if it were operating under 
its fictitious name. 
And it has several, one is the Judicial 
Crisis Network, which we all know 
helped stock the Court with rightwing 
judges, but another one is the Honest 
Elections Project. The Honest Elec-
tions Project and the Honest Election 
Project Action are the pair that work 
on this. 
Money has poured into this effort, 
and the Honest Elections Project has 
been smack in the middle of it. In 2012, 
77 percent of its money came through 
donors’ trusts, which is a great iden-
tity-laundering device for rightwing 
dark money; in 2013, 96 percent; in 2014, 
88 percent; in 2015, 84 percent; in 2016, 
82.6 percent; in 2017, 93 percent; in 2018, 
88.8 percent; and in 2020, the year that 
the Honest Elections Project waged 
dark money voter suppression, the 85 
Fund received over $45 million, iden-
tity laundered through donors’ trusts. 
And much of that money came from 
one single $19 million contribution. 
Somebody wrote a $19 million check to 
suppress votes. 
Folks, if we don’t get to the bottom 
of this, we are going to have a real 
problem on our hands. And when we get 
to the bottom of this, the American 
public will be with us because they 
hate this stuff. You can be a Bernie Bro 
or you can be a Tea Partier and you 
can disagree on everything, and you 
agree that big dark money corruption 
has no place in American democracy. 
This is the issue where Senator 
MCCONNELL’s political minions met 
with the Koch brothers’ political min-
ions, 
and 
they 
did 
whatever 
‘‘minioning’’ they do together. And 
their conversation got out to Jane 
Mayer, who wrote about it, and this 
was the issue that they said to each 
other: We can’t dirty this up. No mat-
ter how hard we try to put a good spin 
on this, voters hate dark money cor-
ruption. Our voters hate it just as 
much as their voters. 
So this is our chance to fix this to 
take out the dark money behind the 
voter suppression effort in all these 
States. 
This isn’t happening, folks. It is 
being done. And we have got to pay at-
tention to who is doing it. And when 
we do, we will restore that funda-
mental voting right of all Americans to 
know who is talking to them in their 
elections—to have ours be a democracy 
without masks, without subterfuge, 
and without dark money. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague 
yield just for a brief comment? 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Gladly. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I just want to thank 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. He has been a 
leader on this issue. It doesn’t get 
enough attention. It is very much part 
of our bill, the Freedom to Vote Act. It 
is universally or virtually universally 
supported, and it is one of the great 
scourges of our politics. 
If we don’t move forward on these 
bills, we are not going to be able to do 
this because we will not get the kind of 
bipartisan cooperation we need on this 
horrible, horrible thing that I think all 
50 of us agree should be changed. 
So I want to thank him for his ef-
forts—not just his speech today but his 
amazing efforts over the months and 
years. 
Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE. 
Thank 
you, 
Leader. Much appreciated. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Thank 
you, Madam President, for the oppor-
tunity to talk about something really 
important to all Americans but specifi-
cally important to Americans from the 
Deep South who happen to look like 
me. 
As I listened to the President talk 
about the importance of stopping what 
he characterized as Jim Crow 2.0, I felt 
frustration and irritation rising in my 
soul. As I keep hearing the references 
to Jim Crow, I ask myself how many 
Americans understand what Jim Crow 
was. I am so thankful—thankful—that 
we are not living in those days. 
But just for those who don’t appre-
ciate the Jim Crow that was, it was a 
time when my grandfather, born in 
1921, would have experienced it. If he 
were still alive, he could tell the sto-
ries of the Jim Crow South and the Jim 
Crow era, an era where, in order for a 
black person to vote, you had to pass a 
literacy test. 
Now, if you could read at that point, 
it would not just be a test on whether 
or not you could read, it would be a 
test on ‘‘Do you know who your Gov-
ernor was 20 years before you were get-
ting ready to vote?’’ It would include 
the threat of being lynched—literally 
killed—because those in power wanted 
to stop Black folks from realizing and 
fully participating in the greatest Na-
tion on Earth and exercising what I be-
lieve is a fundamental responsibility 
and right of Americans, the right to 
vote. 
It would include beatings and the 
power of intimidation, the loss of your 
job if you dared to show up to vote. 
And so when I hear my President, your 
President, 
our 
President 
of 
these 
United States, just a little while ago, a 
week or so ago, talk about Jim Crow 
2.0 and using as the poster child of this 
new Jim Crow South being the Georgia 
voting law, I rushed to read the law 
one more time so that I could under-
stand what in the world is he talking 
about. 
I am here this afternoon because I 
had a conversation with the South 
Carolina NAACP about 2 hours ago, 
and they encouraged me to come to the 
floor and make my comments as public 
as possible so that people understand

what I have read in the Georgia law 
and compare it to the Jim Crow South. 
So what we know about the Georgia 
law—and I have read the law—what we 
know about the Georgia law is the con-
troversies the President spoke about 
and that we have heard Members of 
Congress speak about over the weekend 
is it is illegal to get water while wait-
ing to vote. 
Now, that claim has been proven 
false. It is not illegal to get water 
while waiting in line. That is false. The 
only time you can’t get water while 
waiting in line to vote, according to 
the Georgia law, is if it is a partisan; 
someone campaigning for someone— 
campaigning for someone—you can’t 
bring them water. But if you are an 
election worker or a relative, you can, 
of course, bring a person water. So that 
was completely false. 
But if that is the threshold of the 
new Jim Crow era, it looks nothing 
like the past. However, even that is 
false. What else is in that Georgia law 
that is supposedly the poster child of 
voter suppression? It allows for early 
voting, to include now the Souls to the 
Polls, where you have Sundays where 
you can vote early—as a matter of fact, 
17 days of early voting, more early vot-
ing than the President’s own home 
State or New York. 
It allows for mail-in ballots without 
an excuse, the same thing that was 
turned down by the voters in New 
York. No-excuse, on-demand, mail-in 
ballots is now the law in Georgia. 
New drop boxes. Prepandemic there 
was—it was not legal to have a drop 
box in Georgia. Now, it is legal to have 
a drop box in Georgia and voter ID, 
supported by at least 60 percent of Afri-
can Americans, 60 percent of Hispanics, 
60 percent or more of the majority pop-
ulation. 
After going through point by point 
and realizing in South Carolina that 
minority turnout was stronger than 
the overall turnout in South Carolina 
and that two of the three African- 
American Senators in the U.S. Senate 
today—two 
of 
us—represent 
those 
Southern States, it is hard to deny 
progress when two of the three come 
from the Southern States that people 
say are the places where African-Amer-
ican votes are being suppressed, not to 
mention the fact that 2020 was a banner 
year for minority participation in the 
greatest Nation on Earth from a voting 
perspective, and that is, my friends, 
good news. 
The Democrats’ proposal would allow 
for the supporters of BERNIE SANDERS 
and their tax dollars to go into my re-
election account; I oppose that. It 
would undermine voter ID laws across 
our country; I oppose that. It puts un-
accountable bureaucrats in charge of 
our elections; Americans oppose that. 
And walking in on the day of the elec-
tion, registering to vote without any 
verification, is something I, too, op-
pose. 
And so, when I think about the im-
portant issue of voting and when I 
think about the issue of voter suppres-
sion, it lands on my front porch be-
cause, as a guy who has voted in the 
Deep South all my life, as a person who 
was born in 1965 with a mama who un-
derstands racism, discrimination, and 
‘‘separate and not equal,’’ with a 
grandfather who I took to vote and 
helped him cast his vote because he 
was unable to read, to have a conversa-
tion in a narrative that is blatantly 
false is offensive, not just to me or 
southern Americans but offensive to 
millions of Americans who fought, 
bled, and died for the right to vote. 
So if we are going to have an honest 
conversation about the right to vote, 
let’s engage on that based on the facts 
of the laws that are being passed, not 
the rhetoric surrounding those laws, 
where it looks like power is more im-
portant than people. 
I will close with this. The Civil War 
of this Nation started in my home-
town. One of the most powerful and 
popular Senators in the history of 
America was Strom Thurmond. In 2010, 
when I ran for Congress, I ran for Con-
gress in the place where the Civil War 
started, and I ran for Congress in a Re-
publican primary against the son of 
Strom Thurmond. I won that race, not 
merely because of who I am but be-
cause of who we have become as a Na-
tion. 
The evolution of the heart of Amer-
ica and the hearts of southerners could 
not be more clear on a day when the 
son of a single mother, mired in pov-
erty, runs against the son one of the 
most famous Senators in the history of 
the country and comes out victorious. 
I would love for us to have a con-
versation about what we are doing for 
Americans as opposed to this negative, 
false narrative of what is happening to 
America. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
have deep and tremendous respect for 
my friend from South Carolina. I am 
not a Senator from the South, but my 
family hails from the South, from Mon-
roe, LA, to Alabama, to North Caro-
lina. I know my roots, and I know the 
challenges of Jim Crow, and, thank 
God, we are not in a time of Jim Crow. 
The history that my friend talked to, 
I know. I know his history, and I know 
my colleagues in the Senate know his 
history. We are all not blind to what 
happened in terms of racial oppression 
going back to the founding of this Na-
tion. The Constitution that people 
have been waving around, it is hard not 
to read that and not see that many of 
the compromises were based upon an 
acquiescence to that original sin of 
this Nation—slavery. We know the vio-
lence of what he said and talked about. 
I am frustrated that we can agree 
that there has been overwrought lan-
guage on both sides of the political 
aisle around this issue, but we should 
be focusing on the facts. I have a hard 
time listening to people that want to 
talk about this issue and don’t talk 
about facts. 
In the United States today, it is more 
difficult for the average African Amer-
ican to vote than the average White 
American. That is not rhetoric. That is 
fact. 
We know that Black voters, on aver-
age, are forced to wait on line twice as 
long as White voters. 
We began this session today swearing 
an oath to that flag, saying that this 
would be a nation of liberty and justice 
for all. Where is the justice in a nation 
where there is, on average, for a Black 
person twice as long to vote? It is fac-
tual. 
But let’s keep going because I heard 
my colleague speak. 
During the 2016 Presidential election, 
residents of entirely Black neighbor-
hoods waited to vote. They were 74 per-
cent more likely to spend more than 30 
minutes at their polling place relative 
to residents of entirely White neighbor-
hoods. That is a fact. 
Similar racial disparities were ob-
served right before the pandemic. In 
the 2018 midterm elections, the Bren-
nan Center report found that Latino 
voters waited almost 46 percent longer 
than White voters and Black voters 
about 45 percent. 
The report also found that Latinos 
and Black voters were more likely than 
White voters to wait in the longest of 
lines on election day. 
You could go into State after State 
and you will see who waits, factually, 
on longer lines. 
Georgia—are we going to reduce this 
to just being about water? I find that 
law offensive, but that is not the thing 
that offends me most. 
Do you want to know what is going 
on in Georgia right now? They have a 
historical pattern of dwindling polling 
places in the diverse areas, with some 
voters in Georgia waiting up to 10 
hours in predominantly Black neigh-
borhoods. 
Think about this for a second. Do you 
want to talk about voter suppression? 
You are working a job, you are taking 
care of young kids, and you are going 
to give up a day’s salary in Georgia to 
vote? You want to talk about a modern 
day poll tax? 
And my friends on the other side are 
saying that race is not an issue here? 
I am going to continue with facts be-
cause I was flabbergasted that someone 
could stand up here and say there is 
not a different experience for Blacks 
and Whites when voting. I am just 
going to continue to read the facts. 
Since Shelby v. Holder eviscerated 
the Voting Rights Act that people like 
Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner died 
for, Black voters in Georgia have faced 
disproportionately longer lines and 
fewer polling places. 
The average number of voters per 
polling place have grown 40 percent in 
diverse Atlanta Metro since 2012, and 
voters in Black neighborhoods waited 
nearly 10 times as long, on average, 
after polling places were closed in 
neighborhoods. 
I am looking for an amen from my 
colleague from Georgia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S305 
January 19, 2022 
Mr. WARNOCK. Amen. 
Mr. BOOKER. I mean, in what coun-
try are we, where a certain minority in 
predominantly minority communities 
has to wait 10 times as long? 
And so when you read—and I have 
heard my colleagues read these laws. 
They read: Well, what is wrong with 
having no drop boxes because, hey, we 
didn’t have them before the pandemic. 
What is wrong with not having that 
many days to vote by mail? 
What is wrong with these things is 
obvious because they are not designed 
for voter protection. They are not de-
signed to help voters have more access 
to the polls. They are designed to sup-
press the vote and create these longer 
lines. That is the obvious result, and if 
you can’t see that, I am flabbergasted. 
I am sorry. It is hard. This is not my 
turn to speak, and forgive me to my 
colleagues. But I am flabbergasted that 
the Republican Party, the party of the 
14th Amendment, the party that once 
fought for equal access to the polls is 
now creating this ruse that 19 States— 
that the States that are passing these 
laws, 19 States—this is not about voter 
protection. 
Donald Trump’s own person said the 
last election was the safest, most se-
cure election in American history. This 
is not about in-person voter fraud. 
Study after study has shown that you 
are more likely to be struck by light-
ning. 
This is about lies. I am sorry. This is 
about lies, and they are targeting 
groups. 
I am going to go on with facts, but I 
just want to talk about students for a 
second. I heard Senator JON TESTER. I 
have heard my colleagues from New 
Hampshire, and they are not hiding the 
ball, folks. They are not trying to tell 
us: Oh, we are concerned about it. 
As early as 2011, the State Repub-
lican house speaker at the time in New 
Hampshire—Senators, you know Wil-
liam O’Brien; can I get a hallelujah 
there—promised to clamp down on un-
restricted voting by students calling 
them ‘‘kids voting liberal, voting their 
feelings, with no life experience.’’ 
I hear what you are saying, that this 
is—oh, these laws are innocuous on 
their face. But if you start looking at 
the legislative record, you see groups 
are being targeted in this country. 
Polling places are diminishing on col-
lege campuses. Voter ID laws are being 
created so complex in Midwestern 
States that they are saying you can’t 
use a 4-year ID; it has got to be a 2- 
year ID. Those are some of the laws 
that are being passed. 
Can somebody be a witness on that? 
And I hear this rhetoric where people 
pull out one law: Well, look at this law. 
This is just about shrinking the days, 
or this is so innocuous on its face, and 
I know there are people at home think-
ing to themselves: Hey, that doesn’t 
sound like a big deal. Maybe the Re-
publicans have a point. 
No. Let’s return to the facts. 
I am going to go to Texas because I 
heard the Senator from Texas accuse 
this body of creating rhetoric that was 
divisive. 
Do you want to know what is divisive 
to a country that says ‘‘e pluribus 
unum’’ above where the presiding per-
son is? Do you want to know what is 
divisive? It is telling people in the Con-
gresswoman’s State that if you live in 
a predominantly minority area, we are 
going to remove polling places and 
change laws so that Black folks dis-
proportionately are waiting 5, 10, 15 
times longer. 
Facts. The burden of long lines in 
polling places, closures in Texas in the 
post-Shelby County areas often falls 
disproportionately 
on 
Black 
and 
Latino voters. 
Congresswoman, 
of 
the 
approxi-
mately 750 sites Texas has closed since 
Shelby v. Holder, 542 were in the 50 
counties 
with 
the 
fastest 
growing 
Black and Latino populations. 
Don’t lecture me about Jim Crow. I 
know this is not 1965. That is what 
makes me so outraged. It is 2022, and 
they are blatantly removing more poll-
ing places from the counties where 
Blacks and Latinos are overrepre-
sented. I am not making that up; that 
is a fact. 
I am not going to stop because I am 
tired of hearing that this does not have 
to do with singling out certain popu-
lations in our country—students, Na-
tive Americans—and not others. 
I am not accusing anybody. Please, 
let’s not go around in defense, where 
we crouch into defensive postures. I am 
not accusing anybody of being racist. I 
am just speaking to the facts in our 
country that I know motivate every-
body here. A hundred of my—ninety- 
nine of my colleagues know it is wrong 
to create barriers for some populations 
and not others under the guise of a lie 
that there is a voter security problem. 
Let me continue. I am sorry, Con-
gresswoman, to keep talking about 
Texas. 
In the Presidential primary on March 
3, voters at historically Black Texas 
Southern University in Houston waited 
not an hour, not 2 hours, not 3, 4, 5— 
waited 6 hours. 
A poll of Texas voters conducted just 
in the 2020 election underscored the 
disparity non-White voters faced in 
casting their ballots. 
I am sorry. Senator KAINE, you were 
very good when you talked about that 
sign of 98 percent of people happy. I sat 
here stunned. I was wondering who 
they were polling because they were 
not polling Black and Latino voters in 
Texas when they did that. 
Let me give you the facts. Forty- 
eight percent of Black voters and 55 
percent of Latino voters in Texas found 
it easy to vote, but that leaves a lot of 
folks who didn’t think it was easy. 
White 
voters—actually, 
65 
percent 
think it is easy to vote. 
Everybody is not happy. People who 
wait in 6-hour lines are not happy. 
I just want to give a couple more 
facts. Let’s go to my dad’s home State. 
North Carolina was one of the States 
most affected by poll closures. There 
were 158 fewer polling places in 40 
counties with large Black commu-
nities, and African-American voter par-
ticipation dropped 16 percent. Why? 
Well, my friend Bennet said this. We 
still live in a country where the eco-
nomic disparities between Blacks and 
Whites is what it was in the 1960s. So if 
you are a Black, struggling family, and 
your option to vote means standing in 
line for 10 hours—compared to pre-
dominantly White counties—where the 
wait is longer, you don’t go vote. 
That is not just Black folks. The sto-
ries about disabled voters, with about 1 
in 7 or 1 in 8 pointing out that it is 
hard for them to vote because of phys-
ical impediments—that is discrimina-
tory against them. It doesn’t mean 
people here are anti-disabled. We are 
not throwing those labels around; I am 
just talking about the facts. 
So I just want my colleagues to know 
that I can pull story after story of 
these States—the 19 that are passing 
these laws—if you pull them out and 
want to read them absent context, you 
are going to try to obscure the larger 
picture of what is going on in our Na-
tion, which is that we are seeing en-
tirely 
Republican 
legislatures—en-
tirely Republican legislators—passing 
laws that are disproportionately im-
pacting certain groups, by the facts. 
I want to close with this: On the 
march 
across 
the 
Edmund 
Pettus 
Bridge, they were stopped and beaten 
back. They tried to go again with King 
and were again blocked by Alabama 
State troopers. But they finally got to 
their destination to protest voting 
rights. 
I love what King said there. He 
talked about those people whose hearts 
were discouraged because they hadn’t 
passed voting rights. I know there are 
going to be a lot of people here on this 
day who are going to feel that kind of 
discouragement. 
But, 
Reverend 
WARNOCK, King gave one of his best 
speeches that day where he asked peo-
ple ‘‘How long are we going to have to 
wait? Not long’’ because the truth—I 
am thinking about the lies we are hear-
ing now, the big lies, the lies of in-per-
son voting. The truth, crushed to the 
Earth, will rise again. 
Don’t lie and say there is not a dis-
parate voting reality for Blacks and 
Whites in this country right now; the 
facts speak differently. Don’t lie and 
say that these laws are not being done 
in a way to make it harder for students 
to vote. Don’t lie and say that we are 
a nation that should be doing more to 
ease access as opposed to putting up 
more barriers because to go on more 
barriers is anti-democratic. Those lies 
will not live forever. 
I do believe still that the arc of the 
moral universe is long and it bends to-
ward justice. I still believe that the 
best of our democracy will come out if 
people do not give up and are not dis-
couraged. 
I ask my colleagues right now to con-
tinue on the floor today, to continue to

tell the truth of what is happening in 
your States, to continue telling the 
truth of what is happening in our Na-
tion, because we will win this fight. I 
don’t know how long it will take, but 
that will be determined by how dedi-
cated we are to the principles of this 
democracy. 
We must live in a nation where ev-
eryone is equal—not in rhetoric or in 
slogans or in salutes, but everyone is 
equal in the experience they have to 
participate in democracy. The vote is 
the bedrock of our Nation. It is the 
foundation of the country, and it does 
have cracks that need our repair. 
Whether we get down on our knees in 
prayer or we stand tall, let’s continue 
the work of this democracy so that 
freedom and justice do roll down like 
water and righteousness like a mighty 
stream. 
Forgive me, colleagues, for speaking 
well beyond my time, and I apologize if 
I demonstrated too much emotion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, con-
fidence in our elections is vital to self- 
governance, and voting is a funda-
mental right. This is something that 
Democrats and Republicans can agree 
on. 
Article I, section 4 of the Constitu-
tion states that ‘‘Times, Places and 
Manner’’ of congressional elections 
‘‘shall be prescribed by the States.’’ 
Over the last year, my Democratic 
colleagues have introduced and tried to 
pass several versions of what they call 
voting rights legislation—the For the 
People Act and the Freedom to Vote 
Act. But these wholesome titles are se-
riously misleading. The bills are par-
tisan power grabs that will give the 
Federal 
Government 
unprecedented 
power over our elections and weaken 
the ability of State legislatures to ad-
minister their own election laws. 
Federalizing 
election 
procedures 
would export traditional State author-
ity to the Federal Government and 
defer decisions on how citizens elect 
their congressional representatives to 
Congress. This is inherently less re-
sponsive and less accountable. 
This legislation would undermine 
State legislatures by sending taxpayer 
dollars to political candidates for the 
House of Representatives, weaken pop-
ular State voter ID laws, and make up-
dating rolls more difficult. 
According to a Gallup poll, 80 percent 
of Americans support voter ID laws. 
Yet, under this legislation, States 
would be required to accept essentially 
any document that includes a person’s 
name as a valid form of ID. If you 
wanted to dispel the notion that voter 
fraud occurs in our elections, this is 
not a good start. 
One-size-fits-all 
solutions—the 
ap-
proach the Democrats are pushing—is 
completely unfit for Kansas and for the 
country. 
Perhaps even more alarming—and 
this is the point that I would make 
more strongly than what I just said— 
more alarming than this Federal elec-
tion takeover is the Democrats’ pro-
posed means of passing it. 
President Biden and Majority Leader 
SCHUMER, realizing the limitations of 
their slimmest possible majority in the 
Senate, have advocated for weakening 
the legislative filibuster, the ability 
for the Senate to debate legislation 
until a 60-vote threshold is met. 
Ironically, Democrats utilized the fil-
ibuster vote margin just last week to 
block 
sanctions 
on 
Russia’s 
Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline, making use of the 
same 60-vote threshold they are so de-
termined to demonize. 
The filibuster protects the minority. 
It doesn’t necessarily mean Repub-
licans or Democrats. It may mean just 
somebody with an odd idea. It may 
mean rural, where I come from, or 
urban, where other Members of the 
Senate come from. It may mean the 
ability for a Member of the Senate to 
speak on behalf of his or her constitu-
ents and advocate for their views. It al-
lows every Senator to have the oppor-
tunity to garner more information, to 
seek out sponsors of a bill, to have con-
versations, and to pull people together 
before we decide on how to proceed on 
legislation. But the filibuster does 
more than that. It forces us—I am 
sorry it is necessary to force us, but it 
forces us to work together. 
Freedoms and liberties are protected 
by process. In today’s world, too many 
people want the outcome regardless of 
how the process works. That process is 
called the Constitution of the United 
States. And in our case, there are rules 
in the U.S. Senate that require a 60- 
vote for legislation to be considered 
and passed by the U.S. Senate. 
In the circumstances that those are 
eroded, those process issues—I really 
want to highlight it again. It bothers 
me so much that in so many cir-
cumstances, we set aside process be-
cause we want an end result. But in 
doing so, we erode the personal free-
doms of Kansans and all Americans, 
and those freedoms and liberties are di-
minished as a result. 
I would say it is unusual for me to 
have as many of my colleagues on the 
floor as there are today while I speak, 
and in this case, most are Democrats. I 
would say that if we want to change 
the U.S. Senate—and I am a critic of 
the way we do business here. I never 
enjoyed serving in the U.S. Senate in 
which it worked well. 
If we wanted to do something that 
would actually make a difference as 
opposed to changing the process by 
which we consider legislation, how 
about having committees that actually 
do their work; how about having hear-
ings and markups and debate? Give me 
the chance—give all of my colleagues a 
chance to participate in this democ-
racy of developing legislation. 
But how many times have I voted on 
things that are garnered, put together, 
patchworked together, created by the 
leadership of the Senate or the leader-
ship of the House or working together, 
a bill that is proposed by the White 
House? I want to have ownership. Even 
if I don’t get my way, at least I had the 
opportunity, and it is the committee 
process that allows us to do that. 
Instead of fixing something as funda-
mental as the Congress of the United 
States and having committees at work, 
we are going to change the process by 
which we can get to a bill or pass a bill 
and reduce the role that people who 
have different ideas play in that out-
come. 
Give me ownership of legislation 
through a committee process. Don’t 
take away my ability to better rep-
resent Kansans and Americans and peo-
ple in the minority by changing the 60- 
vote rule. 
Americans voted for a Congress that 
is nearly a 50–50 split between the par-
ties in the House and a precisely 50–50 
split in the Senate. I don’t think Amer-
icans voted to give one party free rein 
to implement an unprecedented power 
grab to nationalize elections and fun-
damentally reshape the way the Senate 
passes legislation. 
Thankfully, there is bipartisan oppo-
sition to weakening the filibuster. A 
majority of Senators agree it would 
bring about massive uncertainty for 
Americans who don’t want to be sub-
jected to the dramatic political swings 
when one election occurs and one party 
is in power and then the next party is 
in power. 
There is so much uncertainty be-
cause there was never the consensus to 
build a 60-vote margin for a piece of 
legislation. 
We must have confidence in our elec-
tions. It matters. I want everyone who 
is legally entitled to vote to be able to 
vote. I understand that voting is a fun-
damental right, but Kansans know 
what is best for Kansans, and congres-
sional Democrats would be wise not to 
underestimate our resolve in making 
our own determinations. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. I thank the Presiding 
Officer for covering the presiding Chair 
for a little longer than usual to allow 
me to make an address to the Senate. 
Madam President, I rise because it is 
time for the Senate to stand on the 
side of protecting our very democracy 
and the freedom to vote. 
You know, this used to be a bipar-
tisan issue, and I was proud to know, in 
the history of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965, it passed the Senate 77 to 19. 
Then, in 1982, when it was reauthorized, 
when we extended it, President Reagan 
said: 
I’ve pledged that, as long as I’m in a posi-
tion to uphold the Constitution, no barrier 
will come between our citizens and the vot-
ing booth. And this bill is a vital part of ful-
filling that pledge. 
When I served in the House of Rep-
resentatives, the dean of the Wisconsin 
delegation, Representative JIM SENSEN-
BRENNER, a Republican, led the bipar-
tisan effort for the Voting Rights Act

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S307 
January 19, 2022 
Reauthorization and Amendments Act 
of 2006. You know, today, we can’t even 
get a vote in the Senate on the Voting 
Rights Act. 
Why 
have 
today’s 
Republicans 
walked so far from those who came be-
fore them? 
There is a simple answer: Too many 
of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle refuse to stand up for democ-
racy and, instead, choose to stand on 
the side of Donald Trump and his Big 
Lie about the 2020 election being stolen 
from him. 
It wasn’t. Trump lost fair and square, 
and President Biden won, and that is 
simply a fact. To suggest otherwise is a 
fraud that undermines people’s faith in 
our very elections. Enough is enough. 
We must act. We have the responsi-
bility to do so. The threat posed by 
this Big Lie is all too real, and in my 
home State of Wisconsin, we have a 
stark example of it. 
I come from a purple swing State. We 
have had many, many closely decided 
elections in recent history. In 2000, 
then-Vice President Gore won the 
State by less than 6,000 votes—a mere 
.22-percent margin of victory. Four 
years later, John Kerry carried the 
State by about 11,000 votes—a .38-per-
cent margin. In both cases, despite 
these narrow margins, those elections 
went smoothly and were fair. Their 
outcomes were not disputed. George W. 
Bush declined to request a recount. No 
credible person, let alone the leader of 
a political party or an elected official, 
claimed the election in Wisconsin 
wasn’t fair, free, and properly decided 
by the voters. Once again, in 2016, we 
had a pretty close Presidential election 
in Wisconsin and another equally as 
close one in 2020. President Biden won 
Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes—a 
margin of victory of .63 percent. 
In 2020, Wisconsinites exercised their 
right to vote in record numbers. More 
than 75 percent of eligible Wisconsin-
ites voted. Wisconsin voters broke the 
record for the highest turnout ever 
measured in the State—with every one 
of Wisconsin’s 72 counties producing an 
increase in turnout, benefiting both 
Presidential 
candidates. 
Wisconsin 
State and local officials and citizens 
who volunteered from both political 
parties did heroic work to ensure our 
election was smooth, safe, and fair. 
They took important steps to make 
our election system worked safely and 
securely 
for 
all 
voters 
while 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic raged in my home 
State. 
Wisconsinites cast their ballots for 
Democrats and Republicans, up and 
down the ballot, and after Wisconsin 
county clerks in all 72 counties can-
vassed the results, Joe Biden won with 
a margin of over 20,000 votes. The vot-
ers of Wisconsin chose Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS to receive our State’s 
10 certified electoral votes, but the 
scrutiny of those election results, 
through the channels provided by law, 
continue. 
After an official vote count showed 
Trump lost, his campaign requested a 
recount and targeted Wisconsin’s two 
most diverse counties—Milwaukee and 
Dane. When the recount was com-
pleted, it came to nobody’s surprise 
that it didn’t change the outcome. 
Trump lost, and President Biden won. 
The votes had been counted and re-
counted, but that did not stop Presi-
dent Trump from filing a lawsuit, try-
ing to throw out 220,000 legal votes in 
Wisconsin. 
Fortunately, 
our 
State’s 
highest 
court rejected this attempt to dis-
enfranchise Wisconsin voters and find 
more votes for himself. As two Wis-
consin Supreme Court justices wrote, 
in concurring with the majority deci-
sion of dismissing Trump’s campaign 
case, ‘‘The evidence does show that, de-
spite a global pandemic, more than 3.2 
million Wisconsinites performed their 
civic duty. More importantly, as it re-
lates to this lawsuit, these voters fol-
lowed the rules that were in place at 
the time.’’ 
To borrow Justice Hagedorn’s meta-
phor, ‘‘Wisconsin voters complied with 
the election rule book. No penalties 
were committed, and the final score 
was the result of a free and fair elec-
tion.’’ 
But that wasn’t the end of the road 
for Republican efforts to sow distrust 
in the 2020 results in Wisconsin. 
In February 2021, a committee of the 
Republican-controlled Wisconsin State 
legislature, by a party-line vote, di-
rected 
the 
nonpartisan 
Legislative 
Audit Bureau to review the administra-
tion of the 2020 election. The bureau, 
according to its report, spoke with the 
staff of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elec-
tions Commission and surveyed all 
1,835 municipal clerks and 72 county 
clerks in the State. They also reviewed 
a host of records regarding the elec-
tion, including a total of 45 sworn com-
plaints, pertaining to the election, that 
had been filed with the elections com-
mission. In October, the bureau issued 
its report, which did not find any evi-
dence of widespread voter fraud or 
wrongdoing in the election. 
Separately, 
a 
conservative 
think 
tank, the Wisconsin Institute for Law 
and Liberty, conducted its own review 
of the election. Their report, released 
in December 2021, also concluded that 
there was no evidence of widespread 
voter fraud in Wisconsin. 
The fact is that our bipartisan Wis-
consin 
Elections 
Commission 
con-
ducted a free, fair, safe, and secure 
election, just as local elections clerks 
did across our State. 
Trump has still not provided any 
credible evidence of voter fraud or elec-
tion irregularities. In fact, Federal 
judges appointed by Trump rejected on 
the merits his false claims about the 
Wisconsin election. Despite all of this, 
the Republican leadership of the Wis-
consin legislature authorized yet an-
other sham process to question the in-
tegrity of the 2020 election, with a 
budget of at least 680,000 of Wisconsin 
taxpayer dollars to boot. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t point out 
that this unnecessary partisan charade 
came shortly after the former Presi-
dent called out these Republican lead-
ers by name for trying to prevent a fo-
rensic audit of the election results. 
This was no mere coincidence. A Wis-
consin State Republican named Mi-
chael Gableman led this effort after he 
famously said—and without evidence— 
right after the November election, that 
it was somehow stolen. He is who is 
leading this probe. 
In August, Gableman traveled to Ari-
zona, on Wisconsin taxpayers’ dime, to 
learn about that State’s widely dis-
credited audit, supported by the cyber 
ninjas. 
Then he was off to South Dakota to 
attend a symposium on voter fraud, led 
by My Pillow’s chief executive and in-
famous 
conspiracy 
theorist, 
Mike 
Lindell. In no effort to show non-
partisanship or to be a neutral arbiter, 
Gableman hired partisan actors like a 
former Trump administration official 
and the head of a group that asked the 
Supreme Court to throw out the results 
of Wisconsin’s election and force the 
Wisconsin legislature to certify elec-
tors instead. 
Gableman has issued wide-ranging 
subpoenas to local officials in Wiscon-
sin’s largest cities and has even threat-
ened to jail them if they fail to comply 
with this taxpayer-funded promotion of 
Trump’s Big Lie. 
Separately, the Republican leader of 
the Wisconsin Assembly’s elections 
committee began her own set of inves-
tigations, issuing subpoenas to clerks 
in Milwaukee and Brown Counties, the 
latter being home to Green Bay. She 
had also traveled to Arizona and, in a 
press release, when announcing her in-
quiries, stated that Wisconsin simi-
larly needs a ‘‘transparent, full, cyber- 
forensic audit.’’ 
To put it simply, there has been a 
constant drumbeat undermining the in-
tegrity of our elections in Wisconsin 
since President Biden was duly elected. 
Casting doubt and undermining con-
fidence in our elections has real con-
sequences. It has led to harassment and 
threats of the hard-working State and 
local elections officials who worked 
tirelessly during an unprecedented pub-
lic health crisis to make sure Wiscon-
sinites could safely and securely exer-
cise their right to vote. Elections offi-
cials across the State have received 
dangerous threats and harassment for 
simply doing their jobs. 
The executive director of the Mil-
waukee Election Commission reported 
being told she deserved to be hung in 
the public square. She received a 
threatening letter at her home, calling 
her a traitor and a profane insult that 
I will not repeat on the floor of the 
Senate. She also received a profanity- 
laced voice mail, telling her she should 
be convicted and hanged. 
Another Wisconsin clerk reported 
being called every name you can imag-
ine and received threats that led to a 
local police department’s having to 
conduct a security review of the clerk’s 
office and having the clerk feeling the

need to install a camera at her house 
for security. 
In Rock County, WI, the county 
clerk’s office asked the local sheriff for 
protection in the wake of angry calls 
after a news report had misstated the 
county’s votes. One of the members of 
the Wisconsin Elections Commission 
had pictures of her home posted on so-
cial media, and she received threat-
ening messages about her children. 
Even elected officials are attacking 
the role of these individuals in admin-
istering our elections. A Republican 
sheriff has called for the five members 
of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections 
Commission to face criminal charges 
for guidance they provided during the 
pandemic about collecting absentee 
ballots from nursing homes. 
Let’s be clear. On January 6, 2021, 
Donald Trump not only incited a vio-
lent insurrection against our democ-
racy, he also incited an ongoing attack 
on 
voting 
rights 
across 
America. 
Across the country, we have seen more 
than 400 bills that restrict access to 
voting that have been introduced in 49 
States. 
In Wisconsin, the Republican-con-
trolled State legislature has advanced 
legislation curtailing voting rights and 
has put up barriers to make it harder 
to vote. Last year, they passed meas-
ures that would make it harder for vot-
ers to turn in their absentee ballots. 
They have passed legislation that 
threaten election officials with felonies 
for assisting voters with minor issues 
on their ballots, and they want to 
make it harder for people with disabil-
ities and who cannot make it into the 
polls to exercise their right to vote. 
Thankfully, our Wisconsin Governor 
has vetoed these measures. 
Despite drop boxes being a safe, se-
cure, and effective way for voters to 
turn in their ballots and have their 
votes counted and despite previous sup-
port for their use from Republicans in 
the State legislature, Trump’s Big Lie 
has pushed them to now oppose the use 
of drop boxes statewide. In fact, there 
is now a push to override guidance 
from the Wisconsin Elections Commis-
sion to make drop boxes for legal bal-
lots illegal in Wisconsin. 
At the same time, the Republicans in 
the State legislature are advancing a 
redistricting proposal that will double 
down on Wisconsin’s unprecedented 
level of hyperpartisan gerrymandering, 
where politicians pick their voters in-
stead of people choosing their elected 
officials. 
Not to be outdone, the New York 
Times has reported that my fellow Sen-
ator from Wisconsin—and this is a 
quote—‘‘believes Democrats cheat.’’ 
This false accusation was accom-
panied by a proposal from this U.S. 
Senator to change the rules in Wis-
consin and have the Republican-con-
trolled State legislature seize control 
over the administration of our elec-
tions, taking this nonpartisan process 
out of the hands of our bipartisan, 
independent Wisconsin State Elections 
Commission. 
As was reported, ‘‘Senator RON JOHN-
SON, a Republican, said that G.O.P. 
state lawmakers should unilaterally 
assert control [over] federal elections, 
claiming that they had the authority 
to do so even if Gov. Tony Evers, a 
Democrat, stood in their way—an ex-
traordinary legal argument debunked 
by a 1932 Supreme Court decision and a 
1964 ruling from the Wisconsin Su-
preme Court.’’ 
That is from the New York Times. 
For my part, I believe voting rights 
are fundamental to our democracy, and 
that is why I will keep on working to 
pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act and the Freedom to 
Vote Act, so we stop voter suppression 
efforts and protect the right to vote. 
We must ensure that, regardless of 
where you live in this country, you 
have the same access to the ballot box 
and faith that our elections are fair 
and safe. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, my Democratic colleagues are 
continuing what started last week, 
with spending hours trying to convince 
Members of their own party, both here 
in this Chamber and across the coun-
try, that they had no choice but to 
blow up the Senate rules by firing a 
partisan torpedo at the filibuster. 
Now, it appears, from what we have 
heard, 
that 
they 
used 
demeaning, 
shaming words and really went about 
weaving quite a frightening tale about 
what would happen if their Democratic 
colleagues did not cave on this issue. 
That tale was no more based in reality 
than the vial accusations of racism 
that they have hurled at those who op-
pose this push to single-party rule. 
Last week, when this insulting nar-
rative started to collapse, they tried a 
new approach and pitched their assault 
on the Senate as a ‘‘carve-out’’ to ac-
commodate an emergency change to 
election law. 
I fully believe, when someone is 
going to tell you who they are, you 
should believe them. And over the past 
year, we have watched Joe Biden and 
the Democrats throw self-control out 
the window and leverage emergency 
after emergency to expand their power. 
Joe Biden signed more than a dozen 
Executive orders in the very first hours 
of his Presidency, knowing that if he 
did not do this, these policies would 
never see the light of day. 
The people—and that is the people of 
this country—hadn’t seen fit to give 
his allies in Congress the majority that 
he needed for his agenda, so he waved 
his pen and conjured up a mandate for 
himself. 
And now, his Democratic allies in the 
Senate are prepared to do the exact 
same thing on behalf of a bill that 
would federalize elections in America, 
stripping away protections for the bal-
lot box and injecting uncertainty into 
the voting process. 
Who asked for this? No one. If the 
American people wanted this, they 
would have given the Democrats the 
majority they needed to get it done. 
But they didn’t. And, in fact, I hear 
from Tennesseans every day who want 
it to be easier to vote and harder to 
cheat, not the other way around. 
But based on what I have seen, I have 
come to the conclusion that what the 
people want no longer seems to matter 
to our Democratic colleagues. 
We can take today’s event as proof 
that if the people don’t see fit to give 
them the power, they will come and 
take that power and turn the Senate 
into a rubberstamp they can deploy 
when an Executive order just won’t get 
the job done. 
That really frightens Tennesseans be-
cause they can see what is coming 
down the path: open borders, court 
packing, gun control, the Green New 
Deal, abortion on demand, socialized 
healthcare, speech restrictions, fed-
eralized elections, and more out-of-con-
trol spending, and, yes, higher infla-
tion. 
We know that this is the future that 
the Democrats are laying out for 
America. It is the future that they see 
for our children and grandchildren be-
cause these policies are the policies 
that they have fought for since long be-
fore Joe Biden took office. 
Do we really think that this attack 
on the Senate rules will stop with an 
election law takeover? The American 
people don’t think it will. Tennesseans 
do not think that it will. 
As I said, when somebody shows you 
who they really are, you ought to be-
lieve them. And as I have said pre-
viously, this is no way to run the 
world’s greatest deliberative body, but 
this is exactly how the Democrats are 
choosing to go about trying to destroy 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The junior Senator from 
Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, why 
are we here? Why is this Senate dedi-
cating this entire day to a debate on 
the floor? 
Well, we are here today to talk 
about, to debate and consider two crit-
ical voting rights bills. It is our fourth 
try. It is our fourth try. The three pre-
vious times we have tried to get on this 
bill, there has been a filibuster on the 
motion to proceed, an obscure a proce-
dural standing that prevented us from 
getting to this bill. 
We are finally on it, and there is a 
challenge in this Chamber, in this 
country, to explain and articulate 
briefly why this is such an important 
moment and why it justifies, in a ten-
sion between two of my core prin-
ciples—one of which is making sure 
that we work across the aisle and find 
bipartisan solutions as much as pos-
sible and the other that we protect 
foundational principles—the right to 
vote—and through that right to make 
progress toward justice and inclusion 
in our society—that I choose the lat-
ter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S309 
January 19, 2022 
We have seen across our country, in 
recent months and years—ever since 
Shelby County, a Supreme Court case, 
blew a hole in the center of the Voting 
Rights Act passed in 1965, the most 
powerful civil rights law in the history 
our country—a whole series of laws at 
the State and local level eroding and 
undermining access to the ballot. 
And in the months since the 2020 
election, tragically, we have also seen 
now State legislatures take up and 
pass laws designed to change who 
counts the ballot, who certifies an elec-
tion, voter subversion and voter sub-
version, access to the ballot box, and 
who counts the votes. 
Every one of us is here because we 
were elected. Every one of us wants to 
know, or should want to know, that we 
won a free and fair election in which as 
many Americans in our State as pos-
sible voted. 
Why would we want barriers to 
Americans with disabilities, Americans 
speaking different languages, Ameri-
cans working full time and strained by 
their working family commitments, 
Americans who are Black or Brown, 
Native American, or Hispanic, or Afri-
can American? Why would we want to 
have any suspicion that our election to 
this body relied, in some part, on sup-
pressing or miscounting those votes? 
Today, I am going to speak just brief-
ly, if I can, about how today is really 
about a fraying bipartisan consensus. 
Some of my Republican friends and 
colleagues have spoken about how we 
have to continue to hang on to and re-
spect the rules of this Senate, espe-
cially the 60-vote threshold, to moving 
forward on policy changes, and I have 
long defended that and respect that 
concern. But we are also principally 
here because of a forgotten consensus 
about working together to protect ac-
cess to the ballot box. 
We have heard just now from a col-
league the accusation that this is a 
‘‘partisan Federal takeover’’ of elec-
tions. Yet several of my colleagues 
have read and reminded us the Con-
stitution itself explicitly gives this 
Congress the power, even the responsi-
bility, to ensure that Federal elections 
are conducted in a way that is free and 
fair. 
When the first Senate gathered, 
think about who was in the room. 
Think about the qualifications to vote, 
how 
narrow 
they 
were—property, 
White men. Think about the arc of 
change in our Nation and how, year 
after year, generation after generation, 
with a huge amount of struggle, ulti-
mately, the moral question of who can 
vote, of who counts and whose vote 
should be counted has slowly, pain-
fully, through sacrifice, changed. 
There was, for 50 years—from 1965, 
when earned through blood and sac-
rifice on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, 
the Voting Rights Act was signed into 
law by a former Senator from Texas, 
President Lyndon Baines Johnson— 
there was for 50 years a consensus in 
this body that the Voting Rights Act 
was a critical, even a sacrosanct, pro-
tection. 
It 
was 
reauthorized 
five 
times—in 1970, in 1975, in 1982, and in 
1992—by strong bipartisan majorities, 
and in 2006, unanimously. No wonder, 
then, that my friend and predecessor at 
this desk, our President, seems to 
struggle to comprehend how a Repub-
lican Party that included Strom Thur-
mond, when he chaired the Judiciary 
Committee, voted over and over and 
over to reauthorize the Voting Rights 
Act. 
Yet today, as we debate the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
we sadly do not have a single vote 
across this aisle to move us forward. 
How did this happen? How did this 
consensus, so hard-won, fray so quick-
ly? In short, it is because of a lie. It is 
because of a misrepresentation that 
millions of illegals are voting—fa-
mously said by our immediate past 
President. But a widespread belief that 
voter fraud was undermining the very 
credibility of our elections has been 
adopted across our country and spread 
and caused a fundamental break. 
There has also been action by the 
new conservative majority on the Su-
preme Court; first, in 2013 in Shelby 
County, where they took out the sec-
tion 4(b) formula that eviscerated sec-
tion 5 preclearance to provide free elec-
tion protection against voter suppres-
sion; and then just last year, in 
Brnovich v. DNC, when six conserv-
ative Justices concluded that a State 
law in Arizona that had a demonstrable 
disparate impact on Hispanic and Na-
tive American and Black voters could 
be allowed to stay on the books and 
proceed. 
Now, let’s be clear. We should make 
sure there is no widespread voter fraud. 
And on the Judiciary Committee, my 
colleague from Illinois and others have 
led hearings to confirm that there is no 
widespread voter fraud, as my col-
league from California, the former sec-
retary of state, spoke eloquently to 
earlier. 
The Freedom to Vote Act, which is 
the other bill in front of us, benefited 
from 
modifications 
by 
Senator 
MANCHIN
of West Virginia, also a 
former secretary of state, to ensure 
that we have protections in terms of 
voter ID. 
I will also, briefly—and I know I need 
to conclude—respond, if I can, to accu-
sations by several of my colleagues 
that Delaware’s voting laws are not yet 
at the highest standard. And I will say, 
it is true my State has a long, brutal, 
tragic history of race relations that 
were not their best, and our voting 
laws have just now come to up to the 
Federal standards we are hoping to 
make the standard for our whole coun-
try. 
But let me ask this question: In the 
midst of a pandemic, when State after 
State has adopted changes to voting 
ballot boxes and no-fault vote-by-mail 
and same-day registration, why would 
States be moving those back? The pan-
demic isn’t over. 
In November, millions of medically 
vulnerable Americans will be looking 
to vote. Why would we end these new 
provisions to provide access to the bal-
lot box? 
Let me make two last points and 
conclude. 
As I have traveled to a dozen coun-
tries in the last year, I have heard from 
allies and adversaries concerns about 
the health of our democracy. We must 
take action to protect the right to vote 
in this country. 
Last, we should not make the last 
casualty of this dread pandemic rolling 
back voting access. If I must choose be-
tween a fundamental principle learned 
through five congressional civil rights 
pilgrimages spent with John Lewis 
that voting is a moral question or con-
tinue to hold to a rule, I will choose 
the former and embrace a change that 
is as narrow and temporary as possible 
and that will restore debate on this 
floor. 
As I marched across the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge for the last time with 
John Lewis, he stopped and turned and 
said to all of us in his halting voice, 
knowing he was in his last weeks: 
Never give in. Never give up. Never be-
come hostile. Hate is too great a bur-
den to bear. Stay hopeful and keep 
marching. 
It is my hope, Madam President, that 
our debate today, our votes today, will 
give strength and lift and truth to the 
service and the life and the sacrifice of 
Congressman Lewis. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, like many of my colleagues, I 
often speak about my family here on 
the Senate floor. As most of my col-
leagues know, I grew up poor and spent 
years of my childhood living in public 
housing. I never knew my biological 
dad, and my mom and my adopted fa-
ther did the best they could for our 
family with the very little they had. 
I think that small part of my life is 
well known, but what may not be 
known to many people is that my par-
ents were Democrats. Sadly, the Demo-
cratic Party my parents belonged to no 
longer 
exists. 
Today’s 
Democratic 
Party would be totally unrecognizable 
to my parents, just as it is to millions 
of Americans all across our country 
right now. 
I am a proud Republican. It is no se-
cret that I am trying to expand my 
party, but I still believe in the benefits 
of our centuries-old two-party system. 
It makes our Nation stronger; it pushes 
us to listen to both sides, work to-
gether, and leads to progress. 
That is why the filibuster is so im-
portant. As a rule, the filibuster em-
bodies what is most essential to the 
survival of our Republic. It weakens 
the sometimes attractive nature of 
tribalism and bolsters the importance 
of 
and 
need 
for 
consensus 
when 
crafting policy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S310 
January 19, 2022 
The filibuster protects our demo-
cratic process. That is why the Found-
ers designed the Senate to operate this 
way, as a cooling saucer that could re-
sist the temptation of political expedi-
ency that leads our country to wild 
swings in policy and position. 
I make this point not only to high-
light the foolishness of doing away 
with this rule as my Democratic col-
leagues would like to do but to draw 
attention to the gravely concerning 
abandonment of democratic principles 
we see in today’s Democratic Party. 
Madam President, I take no joy in 
saying this, but today’s Democratic 
Party has become the new anti-democ-
racy party. The terrifying examples of 
this are all around us: packing the Su-
preme Court, pushing a radical Federal 
takeover of State elections, ignoring 
our laws on border enforcement and 
criminal prosecution, and forcing un-
constitutional vaccine mandates on 
American 
workers. 
None 
of 
these 
things give more power to the people 
we are elected to represent. 
What these dangerous ideas show is 
that today’s Democrats don’t believe 
that people are capable of getting it 
right. Democrats don’t think their 
ideas can win enough elections to con-
trol a majority in the Senate. Senator 
SCHUMER said as much just last week. 
He said that if the Democrats don’t 
pass their ‘‘Corrupt Politicians Act,’’ 
they will lose their majority. A party 
that once prided itself on being a voice 
for working Americans like my parents 
is now turning to authoritarian tactics 
to impose its will on government by 
force because it does not trust the deci-
sion voters will make. 
In trying to pack the Supreme Court, 
Democrats are saying they do not trust 
the decisions of the State legisla-
tures—bodies comprised of the people’s 
elected representatives. 
In pushing the Federal takeover of 
State elections, Democrats are showing 
that they know their ideas are too rad-
ical to win the approval of voters, so 
they need to leave the backdoor open 
for fraud and the dilution of votes to 
win elections and stay in power. That 
is why they want to give noncitizens— 
those here illegally and who may be 
dangerous criminals—the sacred right 
to vote. 
In pushing an unconstitutional vac-
cine mandate, Democrats are making 
clear that they don’t trust the Amer-
ican people to make smart decisions 
for themselves and their families when 
it comes to their own health. 
In the eyes of today’s Democrat lead-
ers, disagreement is intolerable. There 
are no more opponents; only racists. 
They allow no room for compromise be-
cause all who disagree are evil, big-
oted, and backward. 
When the ruling class strips the peo-
ple of their voice, democracy dies. 
When the elites in Washington decide 
they know better than the families 
they are supposed to represent, our 
American experiment fails. 
Madam President, it is a sad day 
when I think about how unrecognizable 
today’s Democratic Party would be to 
my parents, not because it has natu-
rally evolved or modernized but be-
cause it has abandoned the principles it 
once fought so hard to protect. 
I am sure these words will upset 
many of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle. I hope they do, and I 
hope it drives them to refocus their 
party back where it belongs: on the 
needs of American families. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Michigan. 
H.R. 5746 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
am not sure where to start, having just 
heard my colleague from Florida. I just 
have to say that who he is describing I 
don’t recognize, either, because I don’t 
recognize that at all of anyone who is 
here. 
I just want to start by thanking my 
Democratic colleagues, first of all, for 
voting for the American Recovery Act 
that, among many other things, is 
helping to focus on ways to bring down 
the cost of food and our food supply 
chain, to help fix it, and a number of 
other issues that unfortunately not one 
colleague on the Republican side voted 
for—not one. 
So we have heard a lot today about 
how we should be focusing on the needs 
of the American people. I think there 
would be a collective ‘‘amen’’ from our 
side about that. We would love to have 
our colleagues join us, frankly, in that 
effort. But nothing is more funda-
mental to our democracy than pre-
serving our freedom to vote as Ameri-
cans, and that is really what the de-
bate and the votes are all about today. 
We know there are people willing to 
use violence to stop accurate, legal cer-
tifications of our national Presidential 
election. How do we know this? Be-
cause we were here. We were here a 
year ago on January 6 and witnessed 
the violence and the death and the de-
struction. 
We also know there is a coordinated 
Republican effort across the country to 
limit the freedom to vote and make it 
easier to intimidate and remove elec-
tion officials who won’t do their bid-
ding. And how do I know this? Because 
it is happening in Michigan as I speak. 
Today’s vote on the legislation in 
front of us is the fundamental act we 
must do to stop this destructive, par-
tisan movement, and we also know 
that in order to make this happen, we 
have to return the Senate to its origi-
nal principle—the original principle of 
majority vote. 
Our Nation’s Founders had a lot of 
opinions about the type of country we 
should be and the type of government 
we should have. At times, the discus-
sions got heated—and not just because 
it was summer in Philadelphia, Sen-
ator CASEY. They were actually wear-
ing wool at the time, so it got heated 
in a number of different ways. How-
ever, there was one thing they agreed 
on: Government should be run by the 
will of the majority—not a minority, 
not a King. They agreed on this be-
cause they saw what happened when a 
nation is held captive to the views of 
the minority. 
The very first Constitution of the 
United States, the Articles of Confed-
eration, was, frankly, a dysfunctional 
mess. That is why they gathered in 
Philadelphia to try again and to get it 
right this time, and getting it right 
meant majority rule. 
James Madison said that majority 
rule is fundamental to our democracy. 
Thomas Jefferson said that ‘‘the will of 
the majority is in all cases to prevail.’’ 
In Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton 
wrote a lengthy description of the 
problems that arise when a minority 
can override the will of the majority. 
The Founders didn’t have an opinion 
on the Senate filibuster because it 
didn’t exist. It didn’t exist. However, 
over time, Senators figured out they 
could slow down legislation through 
unlimited debate. 
We know that, at first, the filibuster 
was rarely used—mainly by southern 
Senators who wanted to block civil 
rights legislation. Yet, over time, it 
has evolved from a procedural tool into 
a weapon, and we all know this. This 
weapon is increasingly used to stop our 
Nation from making progress on issues 
that are so important to the American 
people and so important to our families 
and crucial to the future of our coun-
try. 
We are here today because the most 
basic freedom in our democracy is the 
freedom to vote, and across the Nation, 
Republicans are pushing legislation to 
take that away, including in Michigan. 
In 2020, Michigan voters clearly and 
resoundingly chose Joe Biden to be our 
President and KAMALA HARRIS to be 
our Vice President in the largest voter 
turnout in our Nation’s history. They 
won by more than 150,000 votes, and 
that is 14 times more than Donald 
Trump’s margin was in 2016. 
Now, I very much appreciate my 
friend Senator THUNE saying he accept-
ed his first loss to the Senate. None of 
us like to lose. It is not fun. President 
Trump should have done the same 
thing, but instead, Donald Trump’s 
campaign and his allies filed eight law-
suits in Michigan. They lost every sin-
gle one of them. In the only case that 
was appealed to the Michigan Supreme 
Court, the court declined to hear the 
case despite having a majority of Re-
publican justices. 
The people of Michigan voted. Michi-
gan Republican and Democratic coun-
ties verified the vote, and our State, on 
a bipartisan vote, certified it. There is 
no evidence of fraud that would suggest 
we need legislation to now restrict our 
voting. 
So why are Michigan Republicans 
trying to make it harder to vote with 
39 different bills they have introduced? 
Well, 
they 
just 
don’t 
like 
who 
Michiganders voted for. Think about it. 
Because they didn’t like the result,

Michigan Republicans decided to tar-
get Michigan voters as part of a coordi-
nated, nationwide assault on this fun-
damental right that my friend, the late 
Congressman John Lewis, called pre-
cious, almost sacred. 
That is why we must pass the Free-
dom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act today. 
I know that some folks think any legis-
lation we pass to protect the freedom 
to vote must be bipartisan to be legiti-
mate. But when it is time to vote, we 
are told not 1 Republican will join all 
50 Democrats—50 Democrats—in voting 
for the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act; therefore, they say, the bill 
shouldn’t pass. Yet the attacks on de-
mocracy in Michigan and the other 
States are strictly partisan. 
In Michigan, Republicans are even 
using a loophole in our constitution to 
go around the Governor’s veto and take 
away people’s freedom to vote without 
the capacity to veto the legislation. 
They are doing it by a simple majority, 
and they are doing it with not one 
Democratic vote—not one—in Michi-
gan. But they are still doing it. 
Republicans are making it harder for 
people to vote using a simple majority. 
Yet we are told that protecting peo-
ple’s freedom to vote needs a super-
majority to do it. That makes no sense. 
And—wait—I think I hear Hamilton, 
Jefferson, and Madison rolling over in 
their graves. 
Today, we each will choose to protect 
every American’s freedom to vote or 
allow those supporting the Big Lie to 
limit people’s freedoms and undermine 
our democracy. Today, we will choose 
to stand with our Founders and our 
Constitution as written or maintain 
Senate procedures that are seriously 
broken. 
It is time to restore the Senate to 
majority rule, as it was intended by 
the Founders, so we can protect—pro-
tect—the American people’s right to 
vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
as everyone in this Chamber knows, 
the 
filibuster 
requires 
a 
super-
majority—60 votes—to proceed on most 
issues in the Senate. The filibuster is 
truly the essence of this deliberative 
body. It is what makes the Senate the 
Senate. It is what forces collaboration, 
long-term solutions, and prevents a 
partisan roller coaster ride of ever- 
changing laws and rules every 2 years. 
The filibuster puts the brakes on hasty 
legislation and helps prevent unin-
tended consequences, which come with 
most every new law. 
I ask America this: Do you want 
more laws or less laws? Do we want 
more certainty from our government 
or less certainty? 
Arguably, the best speeches to keep 
the filibuster in place have been made 
by Presidents and Senators from across 
the aisle. Nothing is more convincing 
than my Democrat friends’ own words. 
President 
Obama, 
then-Senator 
Obama, said in a floor speech here in 
2005: 
But the American people sent us here to be 
their voice. They understand that those 
voices can at times become loud and argu-
mentative, but they also hope we can dis-
agree without being disagreeable. At the end 
of the day, they expect both parties to work 
together to get the people’s business done. 
What they do not expect is for one party, 
be it Republican or Democrat, to change the 
rules in the middle of the game so they can 
make all the decisions while the other party 
is told to sit down and keep quiet. 
I am still quoting President Obama 
here: 
The American people want less partisan-
ship in this town, but everyone in this Cham-
ber knows that if the majority chooses to 
end the filibuster, if they choose to change 
the rules and put an end to democratic de-
bate, then the fighting, the bitterness, and 
the gridlock will only get worse. 
In that same year, our current ma-
jority leader stated from this very 
floor, and I quote the majority leader 
again: 
We are on the precipice of a crisis, a con-
stitutional crisis. The checks and balances 
which have been at the core of this Republic 
are about to be evaporated by the nuclear 
option, the checks and balances which say if 
you get 51 percent of the vote you do not get 
your way 100 percent of the time. It is amaz-
ing. It is almost a temper tantrum by those 
on the hard right. 
Still quoting the current majority 
leader: 
That is not becoming of the leadership of 
the Republican side of the aisle, nor is it be-
coming of this Republic. That is what we call 
abuse of power. 
If the current Democrat majority 
party jams this through, they will live 
to rue the day, possibly as soon as next 
year. But for now, my colleagues 
across the aisle are kowtowing to the 
radical left base. The tail is wagging 
the proverbial dog. 
Sadly, 25 of my colleagues across the 
aisle have flip-flopped from a position 
they staked out in writing just 4 years 
ago, but thank goodness that 1 Senator 
who signed the letter has remained 
true to his word. 
What has happened to change the 
minds of these 25 Senators? Why is the 
national media not asking them the 
same question? Because it would point 
out the hypocrisy. 
Let me remind them all, as President 
Joe Biden once stated to this body, 
that removing the 60-vote threshold 
would, and I again quote—again from 
President Biden: 
Quite frankly, it is the ultimate act of un-
fairness to alter the unique responsibility of 
the Senate and to do so by breaking the very 
rules of the Senate. . . . Put simply, the nu-
clear option would transform the Senate 
from the so-called cooling saucer our Found-
ing Fathers talked about to cool the passions 
of the day, to a pure majoritarian body like 
parliament. . . . But the Senate is not meant 
to be a place of pure majoritarianism. At its 
core, the filibuster is not about stopping a 
nominee or a bill, it is about compromise 
and moderation. 
These men and women of noble char-
acter, in their heart of hearts, do they 
truly believe in making this rule 
change that will forever alter the way 
our government functions, the way our 
Founding Fathers intended it to be? 
What will they say to the people of 
their State when the shoe is on the 
other foot, when Republicans hold the 
majority in the Senate once again and 
Republicans show them how the hog 
eats the cabbage? 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from New 
Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today in defense of 
what in essence is the very essence of 
our democracy and the voting rights of 
all Americans. 
Our dear friend, someone whom I had 
the privilege of serving with in the 
House of Representatives, the late 
John Lewis, took a beating on a bridge 
in Selma for the right to vote. Surely 
we in the Senate can muster a shred of 
his courage to protect that right. 
There are no other rights without the 
right to vote. It is through the right to 
vote that freedom rings, that justice 
reigns and opportunity arises. 
As we all know, this Monday was Dr. 
Martin Luther King Day, and we have 
to remember his words: He said: 
The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever— 
Ever— 
devised by human beings for breaking down 
injustice and destroying the terrible walls 
which imprison people because they are dif-
ferent from others. 
That is what he called the right to 
vote—humanity’s greatest instrument 
for advancing progress. Well, the time 
has come for us to defend it. 
Now, my colleagues who oppose our 
voting rights legislation have had 
ample time to make their opinions 
heard. Soon, it will be time to end de-
bate and hold a simple up-or-down vote 
on the Freedom to Vote Act and the 
John Lewis Advancement Act. After 
all, the State legislatures passing voter 
suppression laws across the country 
are doing so with simple majorities, 
conservative majorities that in many 
cases were born out of decades of par-
tisan gerrymandering. 
How about the Supreme Court? It 
was a simple majority vote of 5 to 4 
that gutted the Voting Rights Act. 
That was the law that John Lewis and 
others risked their lives for on Bloody 
Sunday. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended 
discriminatory tactics that not only 
blocked Black voters from their ballots 
but other minorities, too, including 
Latinos. 
Shortly after the Civil War, Latinos 
held greater political power in States 
like California, Texas, and Arizona, but 
as Jim Crow spread throughout the 
South, they were pushed out of elected 
positions and threatened with violence 
for their continued participation. 
The Voting Rights Act transformed 
our country for the better. It created 
the diverse, multiracial democracy we 
live in today. I know that my story— 
the son of first-generation refugees

S312 
January 19, 2022 
who came from nothing and rose to be-
come one of 100 U.S. Senators in a na-
tion of 350 million people—is only pos-
sible because of the civil right giants 
who came before me. 
The Voting Rights Act ended Jim 
Crow-era 
voting 
laws, 
and 
its 
preclearance provision stopped States 
from resurrecting them in the future. 
States and localities with ugly his-
tories of discrimination had to get 
preclearance from the Justice Depart-
ment before tampering with their vot-
ing laws. Yet, in 2013, the Supreme 
Court’s 5-to-4 ruling in Shelby County 
essentially said that racial progress 
rendered the need for this oversight ob-
solete—obsolete—as if racism no longer 
exists in this country. 
The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg said it best. She said 
that ending preclearance when it is 
continuing to ‘‘stop discriminatory 
changes is like throwing away your 
umbrella in a rainstorm because you 
are not getting wet.’’ Indeed, that rule 
opened the floodgates for new voter 
suppression laws. 
My colleague from New Jersey often 
cited Texas. Texas, home to millions of 
Black and Latino voters, resurrected a 
strict photo ID law that had been 
struck down just the year before. 
Then North Carolina slashed early 
voting and ended same-day registration 
with a law that the Fourth Circuit 
found 
was 
‘‘intentionally’’—inten-
tionally—written 
to 
disenfranchise 
Black voters. 
Other States, like Alabama, started 
reducing polling locations in minority 
communities. 
These measures may not look like 
poll taxes or literacy tests, but they 
are the tools of oppression just the 
same. Their intent is the same—to de-
press turnout among minority voters— 
and they threaten the promise of our 
vibrant, multiracial democracy. 
Now, throughout this debate—I have 
tried to sit here several hours—I have 
heard our Republican colleagues ques-
tion, well, why, after record turnouts 
in the last Presidential election, would 
we feel the need to revisit voting rights 
legislation. Well, the answer is pretty 
simple: If Republicans systematically 
were not tearing down the laws that 
gave rise to the record turnouts, then 
maybe this wouldn’t be necessary. But 
that is exactly what they have done in 
State after State. 
Voting rights used to enjoy broad bi-
partisan support here in the Senate. In-
deed, Republicans and Democrats stood 
together for decades to reauthorize the 
Voting Rights Act, most recently in 
2006. In fact, I want to quote one of my 
colleagues on the day of the last reau-
thorization. He said: 
America’s history is a story of ever-in-
creasing freedom, hope, and opportunity for 
all. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 represents 
one of this country’s greatest steps forward 
in that story. . . . Every American must 
have freedom of political expression—includ-
ing the free, unfettered right to vote. 
Those words were from Senate Mi-
nority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL, who 
spoke those words on that day. He was 
1 of 16 Republicans who proudly voted 
for the 2006 reauthorization but stand 
in the way today, 16 Republicans who 
still are present in the U.S. Senate, in-
cluding not only him but Senators 
GRASSLEY, SHELBY, CRAPO, COLLINS, 
BURR, INHOFE, GRAHAM, THUNE, COR-
NYN, 
BLACKBURN, 
BLUNT, 
BOOZMAN, 
CAPITO, MORAN, and WICKER. 
That is right—16 Republicans who 
supported the reauthorization of the 
Voting Rights Act still serve in this 
body today. So to them, I say: Join us. 
Join us. What has changed? What was 
right then is clearly right now. Join us, 
and we could pass the Voting Rights 
Advancement Act with a bipartisan 
supermajority—no change to the rules 
necessary. Just join us, as you did in 
2006. 
Well, we know that won’t happen, not 
today, not since our democracy has 
been flooded by a torrential downpour 
of lies. 
Earlier this month, we observed the 
1-year anniversary of the January 6 in-
surrection. A defeated President’s vio-
lent mob nearly overturned a free and 
verifiably fair election and tried to 
overthrow the U.S. Constitution. Shots 
rang out in the Capitol. The Confed-
erate flag waved through its hallowed 
halls. That never even happened during 
the Civil War. 
A New Jerseyan and Capitol Police 
officer named Brian Sicknick was 
drenched in bear spray and later died. 
Imagine using a toxic substance in-
tended to fend off bear attacks on fel-
low human beings, beating officers 
within inches of death, and inflicting 
such painful trauma that multiple offi-
cers have since ended their own lives, 
all because one man could not accept 
defeat—a man with an ego so big, he 
could not fathom losing by 7 million 
votes; an ego so big, he manufactured a 
lie to match it—a lie so big, it inspired 
violence and nearly brought down the 
Constitution. 
That lie should have died within min-
utes of the former President speaking 
it. Instead, it lived. The Big Lie lived 
to grow even bigger thanks to a Repub-
lican Party that is no longer a party, I 
believe, of principle but a party of fe-
alty to a wannabe despot. 
Since the insurrection, the most 
anti-democratic laws since Jim Crow 
have taken the Nation by storm. Last 
year, 19 States passed nearly three 
dozen laws undermining access to the 
ballot box. It is as if they are trying to 
codify the Big Lie into law. 
In 
Arizona, 
Georgia, 
and 
other 
States, they made it harder to vote by 
mail, something that my colleagues 
have talked about that Americans have 
been doing for decades and that Repub-
lican GOTV efforts one time long em-
braced it as a way to succeed. 
They are also removing drop boxes in 
minority communities under the bogus 
claim that they invite fraud. So when 
it is in Reverend Warnock’s commu-
nity or Senator PADILLA’s community 
or CORY BOOKER’s community or my 
community, somehow that drop box in-
vites fraud just simply because it is in 
our community? Another lie straight 
from the mouth of a defeated Presi-
dent. 
And many States are reducing early 
voting days. 
When you add up all of these restric-
tions, what do you get? Longer lines at 
the polls, people giving up, folks who 
have to get home to their kids, workers 
who can’t afford to take a day off. To 
the partisan architects of these laws, 
their sigh of resignation is music to 
their ears. They want to make voting 
so inconvenient for working people and 
communities of color that they don’t 
even bother. 
The Georgia State legislature gave 
itself the power to remove election of-
ficials that were elected by the people 
if they don’t like what they see. Sim-
ply put, these laws gave State legisla-
tures 
new 
tools 
to 
disregard—dis-
regard—the will of the voters. 
So I have come to the conclusion 
that since Republicans cannot win 
elections with the power of their ideas, 
they are doing everything they can to 
change the rules of the game so they 
can win anyway. In doing so, they are 
taking us back to a time and place 
where injustice prevailed, a time and a 
place that I certainly don’t want to go 
back to nor do I want my children or 
grandchildren to go back to or those 
whom I represent to go back to. 
Finally, as chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, I would 
note that when we see an attempted 
coup 
or 
creeping 
authoritarianism 
abroad, we call it democratic back-
sliding. Now other countries are won-
dering: Is that happening to the United 
States? Dictators around the world are 
jumping for joy. This is what they 
want to see, democracy in disarray. In 
fact, last November, the Institute for 
Democracy and Electoral Assistance 
added the United States to a list of 
‘‘backsliding democracies’’ for the first 
time ever—ever. 
Look, 
democratic 
self-government 
only works when all parties consent to 
be governed by whoever wins the most 
votes. That is how elections work. We 
can debate corporate tax rate. We can 
disagree about financial aid funding. 
We can differ over healthcare policy. 
But the outcome of a fair and free elec-
tion, the sanctity of the right to vote— 
these are not up for debate. 
Voting rights are the foundation of 
this entire democratic enterprise, this 
great American experiment. It is time 
every Senator looks into their souls 
and decides how they want to be re-
membered when future generations re-
member this perilous moment in our 
history. 
This legislation will protect the 
rights of all of our voters—young and 
old; rich and poor; Black and White; 
Latino and Asian; indigenous; immi-
grant; Republican; Democrat; Inde-
pendent; the single mom, exhausted 
but relieved her neighbor could watch 
the kids so she could make it to the

polls; the warehouse worker who can’t 
afford a day off but winds up taking 
one anyway; the elderly African-Amer-
ican woman, her hand shaking with de-
termination as she signs her name on a 
mail-in ballot—she remembers life be-
fore the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and 
she will never forget the sacrifices of 
those who marched for it, who bled for 
it, and even died for the right to vote. 
Now, I will just say one final thing. 
We all take an oath to the Constitu-
tion. It is required under the Constitu-
tion to be sworn in as a Member of 
Congress. And in that Constitution, an 
amendment that is seen only as it re-
lates to a different time in history, but 
it is very clear and very powerful: 
The right of citizens of the United States 
to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the 
United States or by any State on account of 
race, color, or previous condition of ser-
vitude. 
[And] the Congress shall have power to en-
force this article by appropriate legislation. 
These rights enshrined in the Con-
stitution under the 15th amendment, 
they are certainly being abridged. They 
are certainly being affected in a way 
that we could not fathom in the year 
2022. How shameful it would be if we let 
it slip through our fingers and be bur-
ied under an avalanche of one sore los-
er’s life. How shameful it would be to 
violate our oath to the Constitution, to 
that 15th amendment, in order to pre-
serve some rule that is not in the Con-
stitution and certainly is not as en-
shrined as that right to vote. 
I hope that those who joined us in 
2006 will be there today to vote with us 
on the Republican side, and if that 
fails, then I hope we will change the fil-
ibuster into a talking filibuster so the 
Nation can see who stands on the side 
of ensuring the franchise of that right 
to vote for every American. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, some-
thing I have been hearing a lot lately 
from members of the media, from 
many of my Democratic colleagues 
here in the Senate, and even from the 
President of the United States is that 
democracy is at stake, that democracy 
will die if we don’t make drastic 
changes to our election system, that 
we are just one election away from the 
end of the experiment our Founders 
began in 1776. 
If my colleagues really believe that 
our democracy is teetering on the edge 
of the cliff, that it is going to fall over 
the edge unless we transform the way 
we run elections across the entire 
country, then they need to be able to 
tell the American people why. But, in-
stead, all I am hearing from Demo-
crats—even from the President, him-
self—is that democracy is on its death-
bed; that Americans are no better than 
George Wallace or Jefferson Davis if 
they dare to question that; and that 
the only solution is for one party to re-
write the rules of the U.S. Senate to 
pass a completely partisan Federal 
takeover of State and local elections. 
Those are truly some wild claims. 
If you take these assertions at face 
value, I can see why some Americans 
might be concerned about the State of 
voting rights in this country, but not a 
word of what they are saying is true. 
The good news is that most people 
live in the real world, where America 
shattered records for voter turnout in 
the 2020 election and 66 percent of eligi-
ble voters cast a ballot, the highest 
level in 120 years. That translates to 
156 million Americans, the most in his-
tory. 
In my State of Nebraska, 76 percent 
of voters cast a ballot in the last elec-
tion. We have been proud to be a no-ex-
cuse State for absentee voting for 
years since long before the pandemic. 
We have that law because we want to 
make it easier for Nebraskans to vote. 
And there are many other States that 
don’t require voters to provide a reason 
before voting by mail, not just Ne-
braska. 
Across the country, turnout was up 
in the last election, regardless of race, 
class, or any other demographic. And 
according to Pew Research, 94 percent 
of 2020 voters said voting was easy. Yet 
Democrats still say voter suppression 
is rampant in the United States. The 
logical response to that is to ask: OK, 
where? 
In Georgia, Democrats say. 
After Georgia passed a new law last 
year, things have apparently gotten so 
bad that the President picked Atlanta 
to give a recent speech on the issue. 
But if you listened to President Biden’s 
speech, you might have noticed that he 
barely talked about the Georgia law at 
all. And when he did, he twisted the 
law into an unrecognizable caricature, 
into Jim Crow in the 21st century. He 
has shamelessly and intentionally mis-
represented 
the 
Georgia 
law 
for 
months, and his speech last week was 
no different. 
But something he didn’t say in his 
speech is that the Georgia law extends 
early voting to 21⁄2
weeks. That is 
longer than blue States like California 
and New York, and it is longer than the 
President’s home State of Delaware, 
which currently allows for zero early- 
voting days. Maybe he should have 
given that speech at his house in Dela-
ware instead of in Georgia. And he 
didn’t say the language in the Georgia 
bill that requires voter ID for absentee 
ballots is very similar to a bill that 
passed the Senate almost unanimously 
in 2002, the Help America Vote Act, 
with President Biden voting in favor. 
So if the Georgia law is the best 
Democrats can do, then there is simply 
no evidence for the idea that Repub-
lican State legislatures around the 
country are trying to restrict voting 
rights. 
With that in mind, here is a friendly 
suggestion for the President. If he 
truly believes, in spite of all that, that 
democracy itself is at stake in a way it 
has never been before, the last thing he 
should want is for the voting laws of 
all 50 States to be overseen by the De-
partment of Justice and a partisan At-
torney General. That power should re-
main with State-level secretaries of 
state, State legislatures, nonpartisan 
local officials—anyone but one official 
at one Department in one branch of the 
Federal Government. In other words, 
he should want exactly the election 
system we have now. Our decentralized 
system, with buy-in from a diverse 
group of voices, is what allowed States 
to adapt to the pandemic and achieve 
voter turnout, a record turnout in 2020. 
But the Democrats’ Federal election 
takeover would give the U.S. Attorney 
General the power to oversee every 
State’s electoral process, and it would 
turn the Federal Government into a 
piggy bank for our House candidates. 
Everyone running for election in the 
House of Representatives would have 
access to Federal money through a new 
program designed to help them fund 
their campaigns. The Federal Govern-
ment would match contributions 6 to 1, 
meaning money that belongs to tax-
payers would go to politicians with 
views that many of those taxpayers 
may oppose. 
This partisan takeover would require 
States to allow felons to vote once 
they are out of prison, overruling the 
States that already have laws in place 
preventing this. And if Democrats have 
their way, they will mandate that 
every single State offer same-day reg-
istration at every polling place in the 
Nation. If you live in a State that has 
decided that that is not a good idea, 
well, too bad. 
Mr. President, it is clear that the 
majority leader wants to get rid of the 
filibuster to accomplish all of this, but 
what Democrats are trying to do in 
Congress right now is the best argu-
ment I could ever imagine for keeping 
the filibuster. Think about it this way. 
Let’s say we are talking about before 
the 2020 election and I told you that 
Republicans would retain the Presi-
dency and the Senate and we would win 
back the House, but the Senate would 
be split 50–50 and we would barely have 
a majority in the House. 
In fact, Republicans are going to 
have the slimmest majority in Con-
gress in more than a century. But 
guess what: Republicans are going to 
try to pass bills that most Americans 
don’t fully support anyway, and we are 
going to dismantle a rule that has pro-
moted bipartisanship and compromise 
in this body for nearly 200 years to ac-
complish it. 
And be honest, you would say that is 
outrageous, and you would be right. It 
is outrageous. You would be begging 
those of us on the other side of the 
aisle to leave the filibuster untouched. 
And if you think way, way back into 
the past—all the way back to 2017 and 
2018—Republicans were in the same sit-
uation that Democrats are in now. We 
had a Republican President and majori-
ties in both Chambers of Congress. We 
had bigger majorities than the Demo-
crats have today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S314 
January 19, 2022 
The former President even outright 
asked us to abolish the filibuster, and 
that brought many, many Democrats 
to the floor praising the filibuster, say-
ing it should never be abolished. 
But we didn’t abolish it for the sim-
ple reason that burning down 200 years 
of bipartisan history for a few tem-
porary victories is shortsighted, at 
best, and institutional arson, at worst. 
And don’t think that by presenting 
this talking filibuster Americans won’t 
see the Democrats’ efforts for what 
they really are—a ploy to abolish the 
60-vote threshold for legislation, to 
abolish the need for bipartisanship, be-
cause, in reality, it will only take a 
majority vote to pass controversial 
bills. 
Nebraskans 
can 
certainly 
see 
through this. In Nebraska, State sen-
ators have to speak on the floor to fili-
buster a bill before our legislature, but 
to overcome the filibuster in Nebraska, 
you need two-thirds of senators to vote 
to end debate, not the simple majority 
that Leader SCHUMER has proposed be-
fore this body today. 
Nebraskans have benefited from the 
consensus-building and the moderation 
in developing good legislation that this 
rule promotes for nearly 100 years. We 
know that it works. The 60-vote thresh-
old in the U.S. Senate does exactly the 
same thing for all Americans. So I urge 
my Democratic colleagues: Don’t abol-
ish the filibuster. 
And if Democrats won’t listen to rea-
son from Republicans, they should lis-
ten to the President himself. 
When he was a Senator, he said: ‘‘At 
its core, the filibuster is not about 
stopping a nominee or a bill, it’s . . . 
about compromise and moderation.’’ 
He has forgotten that now, but that 
doesn’t mean his colleagues who are 
still here have to forget it. Senate 
Democrats were happy to use the legis-
lative filibuster hundreds of times 
under President Trump. 
Not so long ago, it was ‘‘the most im-
portant distinction between the House 
and the Senate,’’ and without it, the 
Senate would become ‘‘much more sub-
ject to the winds of short-term elec-
toral change.’’ That was the now-ma-
jority leader, and he was 100 percent 
correct. 
But now the Democrats are in power, 
and they have changed their minds. 
Today, the filibuster is not only no 
longer essential, but anyone who sup-
ports keeping it is called a racist. That 
is truly incredible, and it is offensive. 
The Democrats who supported the fil-
ibuster a few years ago clearly weren’t 
being truthful, and they aren’t being 
truthful now about the state of voting 
rights in this country. 
The problem they are responding to 
simply doesn’t exist, and the solution 
they have for this imaginary problem 
would do lasting harm to our democ-
racy. I will be voting against this par-
tisan takeover of our elections. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of 
all, I want to congratulate all of these 
speakers. It has been wonderful hearing 
all of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle state their positions, as they 
have done so eloquently. We have all 
learned a lot. I am not sure it has 
changed anything, but we sure have 
learned a lot in this process. 
But I rise today to rebut what I be-
lieve is a great misleading of the Amer-
ican people. 
Before I get into the details, let me 
tell you a little bit about where I come 
from and my political background. I 
have been involved in public service in 
my State of West Virginia for over 40 
years, in one capacity or another. I 
have been in the house of delegates. I 
have been in the State senate for 10 
years. I have been secretary of state. I 
have been Governor for two terms. And 
now I have been here in the Senate for 
going on 11 years. 
When I served in the legislature, I 
could put a bill on the floor or I could 
put a bill in committee, and it would 
go through committee. It would go to 
the floor if it came out. I could get 
amendments 
on 
it. 
Sometimes 
it 
passed; sometimes it didn’t. 
But, at the end of the day, we had a 
place we called ‘‘Junior Rules.’’ It was 
behind the senate chamber. You would 
go behind the door, and there would be 
‘‘Junior Rules.’’ After it was over, after 
we had our debates and discussions— 
whether it be in committee or whether 
it be on the floor—we would all gather, 
Democrats and Republicans. We ate to-
gether. We had some refreshments to-
gether. We spoke about what happened 
today and what we could do to make it 
better tomorrow. I never could under-
stand, when I got here, how divided we 
were. How did this happen? 
So I kept thinking, when I first got 
here they said: Well, you know, the Re-
publicans are over there, and we are 
the Democrats here, and it is nice. We 
all get along and everything. But now, 
when they run, we have to be against 
them. 
I have to be against you, no matter 
how close you may be, no matter if I 
sat beside you, no matter if we have 
dinner at night. If it is your election 
cycle, I have to be against you. Not 
only that I am supposed to be against 
you, I am supposed to basically write a 
check to whoever is running against 
you—to whoever is running against 
you. And maybe, even, they want me to 
maybe go to your State and campaign 
against you. 
And I am thinking: You know some-
thing, where I come from in West Vir-
ginia, if I went to work during the day 
and you did that to me, we are going to 
go outside and have a little conversa-
tion. That ain’t going to happen back 
where I come from. And I wasn’t going 
to do it here. 
Now, if we can change some things, 
that is what we should be changing. 
Why should we do this? How are we ex-
pected to sit down at the end of the day 
or the end of a session or at the end of 
anything and come back on Monday 
and say, ‘‘OK, now, Senator THUNE, 
would you go on this amendment with 
me and help me with this bill,’’ after I 
just came out and basically worked for 
your opponent that the Democrats 
have recruited and basically given 
them money. 
That is not going to happen. It is not 
going to happen. 
So I keep thinking, we keep think-
ing: What is wrong with the place? 
That is what is wrong. I tried to get 
just a little oath that we could all sign 
that we wouldn’t do that to each other. 
I guess there used to be a gentlemen 
and ladies’ agreement that you just 
didn’t do those things, but not any-
more, not anymore. 
I heard about the good old days. I 
don’t know what happened to the good 
old days, but I can tell you they are 
not here now. 
We can talk about a lot of things and 
the way we want to change, but I still 
really believe we should talk about 
how we treat each other and how we 
approach each other in a body that this 
330 million people are depending upon. 
But rules—what little bit we have 
left that maybe makes us take pause 
before we jump off of that bridge—we 
had better be careful what we are 
doing. 
After the State legislature, I also had 
the privilege to serve as West Vir-
ginia’s secretary of state. I never one 
time, as secretary of state in my offi-
cial capacity, had anyone ever talk to 
me: We have got to suppress the vote. 
Democrat, Republican, Independent, no 
matter what, no one ever came and 
said: Joe, we have got to stop this 
group from voting because that won’t 
help us. No one ever thought that way. 
You know where most of my ideas 
came? I brought in early voting. I had 
a lot of men working in the mines, 
shift working and all that, and some-
times on Tuesdays, on our election 
day, they couldn’t get off. They had to 
work. 
So someone says: Do you know what 
we did in our State? We got early vot-
ing. We call it no-excuse voting. You 
can come any time you want. You have 
got 7 days, 10 days, 2 weekends, what-
ever. 
So I had a hard time getting people 
to understand. They think: Oh, maybe 
something bad is going to happen; 
something nefarious will happen. 
It took a while for me to get 7 days 
in, just one week in. I fought for that. 
After I got 7 days, they wanted more. 
I understand that Kentucky just has 
early voting, and that is great. They 
make those decisions. 
That came out of the experiment we 
call the great experiment, State by 
State. There are 50 experiments that go 
on every day in every State. We should 
learn from them. They should learn 
from us. We all share together. We 
have got many former Governors sit-
ting here. We know how this works. 
And that is what we are talking about. 
I also started a program called 
SHARE. It was the SHARE Program. I

had low turnout in West Virginia, and 
I was trying to get the turnout up. So 
I am thinking: What can I do? And I al-
ways thought this: I can’t sometimes 
teach an old dog new tricks, but I can 
teach a pup some tricks and maybe get 
the old dog to follow him. So I thought 
of a program called SHARE, Saving 
History and Reaching Every Student— 
Saving History and Reaching Every 
Student—because Jennings Randolph, 
former Senator Jennings Randolph in 
West Virginia, was the father of the 18- 
year-old vote. It took him 21 years to 
get it done. He started back in World 
War II and didn’t get it done until the 
1970s—1970. He was the father. 
So I had the Jennings Randolph 
award. I had every high school com-
peting for it, because we went out and 
educated students that if you are 17 
years of age and you turn 18 on elec-
tion day or before—on general election 
day or before—you can vote in the pri-
mary election at 17 years of age. No 
one knew that. The kids didn’t know 
that. 
We got them all fired up, and, I mean 
to tell you, we had awards and made a 
big ceremony, and all of our election 
counts went up. Everything went up. 
We did a good job. And they really, 
really appreciated it. 
So we were able to increase the turn-
outs, but I believe with every fiber in 
my body that every eligible citizen of 
voting age should have the right to 
vote and be protected by law—every-
one. And I think everyone in here be-
lieves the same thing—I truly do—that 
we should be able to do that. 
Later today, we are going to vote. 
And I am going to vote, again, to pro-
tect that right, and I am going to be 
proud to cosponsor the Freedom to 
Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Amendment Act. We all have 
different positions on that, but I am 
proud to be a part of that. But that is 
not what we are debating right now, 
and I think we all know that. Right 
now, we are debating a fundamental 
change in the Senate rules that will 
forever alter the way this body func-
tions. 
For the last year, my Democratic 
colleagues have taken to the Senate 
floor, cable news airwaves, and pages of 
newspapers across the country to argue 
that repealing the filibuster is actually 
restoring the Senate to the vision that 
the Founding Fathers intended for this 
deliberativee body. 
My friends, that is simply not true. 
It is just not true. The U.S. Senate has 
never, in 233 years, been able to end de-
bate on legislation with a simple ma-
jority vote. With a simple majority 
vote, they have never been able to end 
debate. They could not stop the debate. 
Robert Byrd used to say that there 
are two things a Senator can do: A 
Senator has a right to amend and a 
right to speak. He always said that. 
In fact, prior to 1917, there was no 
mechanism for ending debate in the 
Senate whatsoever. You couldn’t end 
it. In that year, the Senate adopted the 
cloture rule. It required the debate to 
end when two-thirds of voting Senators 
willed it. 
Since then, the cloture rule has been 
amended seven times, always by reg-
ular order. I hear all of these things 
that we are talking about, but we for-
get that a lot of things are done with 
regular order. Just recently, Senator 
SCHUMER, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, 
the 
debt ceiling—they did that using the 
rules. You didn’t break the rules to do 
that. You did it. You worked it out, 
which is the leadership’s responsibility. 
It means that the Senate has fol-
lowed its own rule book when making 
changes that affect legislative debate. 
We have changed rules. We have all 
talked about how many times rules 
have been changed. We changed them, 
but we changed them with the rules. 
We didn’t break the rules; we changed 
the rules. But, all of a sudden, now we 
just can’t do it anymore. We just got to 
blow it up. 
The rule book means that the rules 
changes are done on the basis of broad 
bipartisan consensus, not imposed on 
the minority by raw majority power. 
No matter who is in power, the major-
ity does not have that power to do that 
in this Senate. 
Now my colleagues propose to side-
step this process. They would use the 
nuclear option to override a rule that 
we have used ourselves but now seem 
to find unacceptable. 
Unacceptable now. 
We are going to break the rules to 
change the rules. We will make up new 
rules as we go along and invite our-
selves and future majorities to dis-
regard the rule book at will. 
No rule of the Senate can withstand 
the act of a willful majority. No rule 
will withstand a willful majority—not 
the cloture rule or any other rule. Let 
this change happen this way, and the 
Senate will be a body without rules. 
There will be no rules. 
The Senate’s greatest rule is the one 
that is unwritten. This is an unwritten 
rule, and it is the greatest one we have. 
It is the rule of self-restraint, which we 
have very little of anymore—self-re-
straint. That rule will be broken along 
with the cloture rule if the nuclear op-
tion is executed, and for that—I cannot 
be a party to that. 
But there is good news. Here is the 
good news. We don’t have to change the 
rules to make our case to the American 
people about voting rights, about the 
John Lewis. We don’t have to. We real-
ly don’t. 
Senator SCHUMER didn’t have to file 
cloture to cut off debate. He didn’t 
have to fill the amendment tree to 
block Republican amendments. We are 
here. We could have kept voting rights 
legislation as the pending business for 
the Senate today, next week, a month 
from now. This is important. Let’s 
work it out. Let’s stay here and go at 
it. I think you all are here. Everybody 
is here. We had a lot of good talks 
today. I am sure you have a lot of 
amendments you would like to make, 
and all of us would like to make 
amendments. If you want to see it 
work again, let’s do it. Let’s go for it. 
That is exactly what I think should 
be done. I think the American people 
really need that. I think that we owe 
that to them. We wasted a year behind 
the scenes, partisan negotiations back 
and forth, talking through each other, 
around each other, but not to each 
other. 
Let’s have the debate, Democrats and 
Republicans, and let the American peo-
ple decide. The pressure will come. 
That is what the filibuster is all about. 
The pressure is mounting until you 
have made either a compromise, you 
have made a decision; you all have de-
cided to go—you know, one way or an-
other, you are going to end that fili-
buster. And today, we haven’t seen 
that. 
Just 4 years ago, 61 of us, 61 Sen-
ators—myself being 1—33 of us on the 
Democrat side, many of whom are sit-
ting in the Chamber today—you have 
heard this many times. We sent a let-
ter to Senator SCHUMER and to Senator 
MCCONNELL warning them of the dan-
gers of eliminating the filibuster. That 
letter presented a united front com-
mitted to ‘‘preserve the ability of the 
members to engage in extended debate 
when bills are on the Senate floor.’’ 
While some of the Senators have 
changed their positions, I have not. I 
respect that this is a two-way street, 
and I would hope you would respect 
where I am. I respect that you have 
changed your position on this. I would 
hope that you would respect that I 
have not, and I have never wavered on 
this. 
I do not and will not attack the con-
tent of the character of anybody who 
has changed their position, and I would 
hope you would give me the same op-
portunity and not attack mine. 
Allowing one party to exert complete 
control in the Senate with only a sim-
ple majority will only pour fuel on the 
fire of political whiplash and dysfunc-
tion that is tearing this Nation apart, 
and you don’t have to look very far to 
see how we are tearing ourselves apart. 
I can tell you, in every part of this 
country, people are divided now. It 
used to be that we couldn’t talk about 
religion at the supper table; now, you 
can’t talk about politics. It has truly 
become a blood sport, and it should not 
be that way. 
The rest of the world is looking at us. 
They are depending on us. They are 
looking for guidance. They are looking 
for some stability. 
If we do this, there is not going to be 
any check on the executive branch. 
Bob Byrd was scared to death of not 
having a check on the 
executive 
branch, 
even 
when 
the 
executive 
branch was part of his own party, being 
a Democrat. He always said: I do not 
work for the President; I work for the 
people of West Virginia. He made very 
sure of that, he made sure that every 
President knew that, and he made sure 
he would hold them accountable, and

they weren’t going to streamroll over 
him. 
The filibuster plays an important 
role in stabilizing our democracy from 
the transitory passions of the majority 
and respecting the input of the minor-
ity in the Senate. 
Contrary to what some have said, 
protecting the role of the minority, 
Democrat or Republican, has protected 
us from the volatile political swings 
that we have endured over the last 233 
years. 
The role of the minority is what en-
sures the policies of our Nation have 
input from all corners of the country. 
We must never forget this is a Senate 
made up of 50 States, 100 Senators, blue 
States and red States. 
For those who believe that biparti-
sanship is impossible, we have proven 
them wrong. In the last several years, 
we have made historic investments in 
our Nation’s public lands, passed tril-
lions of dollars in COVID–19 relief, and 
finally invested in rebuilding our Na-
tion’s infrastructure. These critical 
pieces of legislation have had signifi-
cant impacts on Americans across the 
country. They were passed with broad 
bipartisan support. 
We can do it again. We truly can. We 
can make it easier to vote. We must. 
We can make it harder to cheat. I 
think we can. We have heard from our 
Republican colleagues, who basically 
agree with us on that. We can reform 
the Electoral Count Act, which is what 
caused the insurrection. We agree on 
that. We can fix that. We will never 
have to witness another January 6, 
such an absolutely deplorable stain on 
this great country of ours. And we can 
protect local election officials from 
harassment and intimidation by mak-
ing them Federal crimes. We can do 
that, and I know we can do that to-
gether. 
I am going to leave you with this: In 
May 2010, just a month before Robert 
C. Byrd died—he died in June of 2010. 
This was a month before. Senator Byrd 
was asked by then-chairman Senator 
CHUCK
SCHUMER
of the Rules Com-
mittee—I believe at that time—to tes-
tify about the filibuster before the Sen-
ate Rules Committee because of his un-
surpassed knowledge on this subject. 
Senator CAPITO knew him well too. 
She knows how he would pontificate at 
times with us. 
Senator 
Byrd 
began 
by 
quoting 
James Madison. He said: 
Madison said that the purpose of the Sen-
ate was ‘‘first, to protect the people against 
their rulers, secondly, to protect the people 
against the transient impressions into which 
they themselves may be led,’’ and that the 
Senate serves as a ‘‘necessary fence against 
such danger.’’ 
Senator Byrd testified that ‘‘the 
right to filibuster anchors this nec-
essary fence.’’ He concluded with, ‘‘We 
must never, ever, ever, ever tear down 
the only wall, the necessary fence, that 
this nation has against the excesses of 
the executive branch and the resultant 
haste and tyranny of the majority.’’ 
Eliminating the filibuster would be 
the easy way out. It wasn’t meant to be 
easy. 
I cannot support such a perilous 
course for this Nation when elected 
leaders are sent to Washington to unite 
our country, not to divide our country. 
We are called the United States, not 
the Divided States, and putting politics 
and party aside is what we are sup-
posed to do. 
It is time that we do the hard work 
to forge the difficult compromises that 
can stand the test of time, and that is 
why we are here—230 years. Think 
about it. Wars. Depressions. Think of 
all the hardships this country has gone 
through, all the people who have suf-
fered and fought for every right we 
have. We are not going backwards. 
But with that being said, we can do 
better than what we are doing today. 
We truly can. We must promise Ameri-
cans a brighter future. I think we can 
do that together. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in 
the last 6 years, Democrats have fili-
bustered 589 bills and nominations— 
589. That was their right as the minor-
ity at the time. That right has been 
protected. It was their right to demand 
that their voice be heard, but it seems 
like that was then; this is now. 
Two years ago, when Senator TIM 
SCOTT brought a serious policing re-
form bill to the Senate floor to debate 
at a moment of national debate on sup-
porting law enforcement, Democrats 
filibustered that bill and would not 
allow open debate on that bill. 
Just last week—just last week—55 
Senators voted for sanctions on Russia 
as 
they 
surround 
the 
borders 
of 
Ukraine. Just last week, 55 Senators 
voted for that, but that wasn’t enough, 
and the voice of the minority was pro-
tected when Democrats blocked sanc-
tions on Russia as they threatened 
Ukraine. That was their right to do, 
but it seems like that was then; this is 
now. 
This letter in 2017 was sent. Twenty- 
seven Democratic Senators wrote a let-
ter to MITCH MCCONNELL and CHUCK 
SCHUMER
asking that there be no 
changes in the legislative filibuster, in-
cluding this sentence that they all 
wrote together: 
We are mindful of the unique role the Sen-
ate plays in the legislative process, and we 
are steadfastly committed to ensuring that 
this great American institution continues to 
serve as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Therefore, we are asking you to join us 
in opposing any effort to curtail the existing 
rights and prerogatives of Senators to en-
gage in full, robust, and extended debate, as 
we consider legislation before this body and 
in the future. 
That was then; this is now.

COONS, PATRICK LEAHY, DIANNE FEIN-

WHITE-
HOUSE, and BOB MENENDEZ all asked me 
to join them in opposing any effort to 
curtail the existing rights and preroga-
tives of Senators to engage in full, ro-
bust, and extended debate. 
I will. I would be glad to join you in 
that because I believe this body is a 
unique body in the world, just like you 
did in 2017. I don’t know what has 
changed. Debate is still debate. Dif-
ficult issues are still difficult issues. 
And when my Democratic colleagues 
filibustered almost 600 times in 6 years, 
it was their right, as it has been for 
two centuries. 
This is the one place in American 
Government where the voice of the mi-
nority is heard—the one place. This is 
the one place where minority opinions 
have to come to the forefront. 
A discussion about changing the 
rules of the Senate with simple 51 votes 
and to be able to shift this to a body, 
on legislation, where whoever is ahead 
on the football game gets to decide the 
rules for the rest of the game is not 
really a set of rules at all, and it will 
fail to protect the voice of the minor-
ity in America, this unique thing that 
we have where even if you lost an elec-
tion, you know at least your voice can 
still be heard and you won’t be run 
over. 
A conversation that is happening in 
this body today to say we are going to 
permanently block out the opinions of 
the minority in America is a wrong de-
cision, and I will join the 27 Demo-
cratic Senators who asked me 4 years 
ago to join them in opposing that 
change because it is the wrong direc-
tion. 
I have enjoyed listening to some of 
the speeches—and I have listened all 
day to speeches of my Democratic col-
leagues—about how broken the Senate 
has become and about how it needs to 
be restored to its status as the world’s 
greatest deliberative body. I agree. 
Senator MANCHIN, who just spoke be-
fore me, made that same challenge to 
say: Let’s do it. Let’s actually engage 
in debate. Let’s solve these issues. 
Let’s actually work behind the scenes. 
Let’s not talk at each other through 
the media; let’s actually talk to each 
other. Let’s close the door and actually 
get a chance to be able to work 
through things and be off the C–SPAN 
camera for a moment and not do the 
show. Let’s actually engage in real dia-
logue. Let’s solve the issues. 
That is what we are supposed to do. 
What we are not supposed to do is to 
say: You know what, I don’t want to do 
that kind of hard work behind the 
scenes. I will just change the rules, 
blame it on you, and walk away. 
That is not what we are supposed to 
do as a Senate. 
I have been told today that I refuse 
to stand on the side of democracy. I

was told by President Biden last week 
that I either stand with the Republican 
Abraham Lincoln or the Democrat Jef-
ferson Davis and I should make my 
pick. Well, I would say, for me, person-
ally, as a member of the party of Lin-
coln, I probably stand with Abraham 
Lincoln. 
I am concerned that my friends on 
the other side of the aisle—and I do 
have many friends on the other side of 
the aisle. I am concerned that somehow 
they have convinced themselves that 
when they filibuster, it is righteous, 
but when I filibuster, it is evil and that 
this time it is different. And somehow 
with the filibuster, we can change it a 
little bit and only be a little bit preg-
nant, and it will all be fine. 
I just don’t think it is going to work 
that way, and I think a century from 
now writers will look back on this day 
and will identify what started the 
crack—when the Senate started to say: 
We no longer are going to try. We are 
just going to become the House and run 
over the minority, and the voice of the 
minority in America is no longer going 
to count. 
I stand on the side of the filibuster, 
like Senator SCHUMER did in 2017, when 
he stood right over there and looked in 
the eyes of Senator MCCONNELL and 
said, ‘‘I hope the Republican leader and 
I can, in the coming months, find a 
way to build a firewall around the leg-
islative filibuster, which is the most 
important distinction between the Sen-
ate and the House. Without the 60-vote 
threshold . . . the Senate becomes a 
majoritarian 
institution 
like 
the 
House, much more subject to the winds 
of short-term electoral change. No Sen-
ator would like to see that happen so 
let’s find a way to further protect the 
60-vote rule for legislation.’’ 
I stand with Senator DURBIN when he 
said, ‘‘I can tell you [ending the legis-
lative filibuster] would be the end of 
the Senate as it was originally devised 
and created going back to our Found-
ing Fathers. We have to acknowledge 
our respect for the minority, [and] that 
is what the Senate tries to do in its 
composition and its procedure.’’ 
Listen, we disagree on some elements 
on this bill, and I have heard the de-
bate. 
I will tell you, I have been outspoken 
to protect the rights of every indi-
vidual to vote in our State. I am proud 
of the voting laws in my State. We 
have early voting. We have no-excuse 
absentee voting. We engage people to 
be able to vote in every community, 
and we fight very hard to be able to 
make sure that every place and every 
precinct has the shortest line possible. 
That has been a big deal for our State 
for a long time. 
You go back to the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act and you look across the 
South and the States that went under 
preclearance, my State was not one of 
those because in my State, even at 
that time with Jim Crow laws, we were 
protecting the rights of individuals to 
be able to vote, as it should be. 
But my State is being thrown under 
the bus currently. My State is cur-
rently being accused by some of my 
colleagues as being a State that is on 
the list of 34 evil States that have 
passed voter suppression laws in this 
past year. 
Do you know what my State’s guilt 
is? We passed a law this past year that 
said, if you are going to vote absentee 
by mail, you have to request it 15 days 
before the election. We did that be-
cause the U.S. Postal Service asked us 
to do that because the U.S. Postal 
Service said if a ballot is going to be 
mailed out to somebody and get mailed 
back in time and get counted, we need 
2 weeks of time to do it, not 7 days. 
By the way, my State is on the list of 
the 34 evil States doing voter suppres-
sion, but the State of New York passed 
the exact same law, and somehow, they 
are not on the evil list. But they also 
followed the encouragement of the U.S. 
Postal Service to give 15 days for the 
ballot to go out and to come back. 
My fellow colleagues, that is not 
voter suppression, that is making sure 
every vote counts—but somehow my 
State is on the list. 
We do get a little frustrated when we 
get accused of being racist when we 
disagree on some issues in this bill. 
We have some disagreements on 
whether felons, as they walk out, 
should be able to vote immediately. 
That has been State-to-State decisions. 
I understand some States do that, some 
States do not. My State hasn’t voted 
for folks who are convicted sex offend-
ers and rapists and murderers, the day 
they walk out of the prison, to have 
their voting rights returned. By the 
way, some of the folks on the Demo-
cratic side of the aisle, your State has 
not either. This bill changes that. Can 
we have an honest conversation about 
convicted rapists walking out of prison 
and voting the next week, whether that 
is something that should be restored 
right away—by the way, even during 
their time of parole? 
We have disagreements on voter ID. 
We have disagreements on same-day 
registration. We apparently have dis-
agreements on whether we should have 
House candidates for Federal office get 
to take a salary from Federal tax dol-
lars while they are running for office 
and get a 6-to-1 match, where the 6 is 
the Federal dollars and the 1 is the pri-
vate dollars if you are running for the 
House of Representatives. No, I don’t 
think I am a racist because I disagree 
with whether House candidates should 
be able to take a salary from Federal 
tax dollars while they are running for 
office and get a 6-to-1 match, but that 
is what I am being accused of consist-
ently. 
We have a disagreement on auto-
matic registration of voters. Appar-
ently, there are some other disagree-
ments because, even in the bill itself, it 
gives a waiver for people who are ille-
gally present in the country who ‘‘acci-
dentally’’ get registered to vote; that it 
gives them some immunity in that 
process. 
We have disagreement on how much 
control unelected folks are going to 
have on redistricting. 
We just have disagreements on these 
things. Can we not have disagreements 
and debate these things out and not be 
called a racist in the process; that you 
are joining with Jefferson Davis if you 
disagree 
whether 
House 
Members 
should be paid while they are running 
for office out of Federal tax dollars? 
I don’t think this is about voting 
rights anymore. I think this has be-
come about power. 
I don’t have any doubt that we need 
to protect the voting rights of every 
single individual. That is why I am 
grateful the 1965 Voting Rights Act is 
there. But I want to make sure that we 
are protecting our Republic and that 
we stay engaged in what it takes to ac-
tually guard, day-to-day, how we vote, 
how we make decisions, and that we 
admit there are differences in voting 
between Alaska, Oklahoma, and New 
York. 
Now, again, we disagree on some 
things, and there are some things in 
this bill that even some of the folks in 
this room, their own States don’t agree 
with. The State of New York doesn’t 
allow same-day registration. In fact, 
they just voted on that in November 
and voted it down. The people of New 
York said: We don’t want to do that. 
The State of New York doesn’t allow 
no-excuse absentee ballots. My State 
does. We have done that for years. The 
State of New York doesn’t allow people 
to bring food and water to people in 
line. The State of New York requires 
people to request an absentee ballot to 
do it 15 days before the election, ex-
actly like my State does. 
Listen, let’s debate the issues. Let’s 
take the time needed to resolve it, and 
let’s actually resolve it. 
We talked a lot about division and 
things that are hard. If you don’t mind 
me taking a bit of a detour, there are 
things that we agree and disagree on, 
some of them profoundly. One of them, 
I want to mention as well. 
You know, this week would have 
been Betty White’s 100th birthday. You 
talk about America’s sweetheart. I 
can’t find a soul who doesn’t like Betty 
White. If you find somebody who 
doesn’t like Betty White, will you let 
me know who that is because that is 
one hard heart. 
Everyone loves Betty White. 
Betty White spent 70-plus years rais-
ing money in support of the Humane 
Society—overwhelming support, mil-
lions of dollars that she raised for the 
Humane Society, and there was broad 
support for puppies and kittens. So I 
can just ask the question: Who dis-
agrees with Betty White, puppies, and 
kittens? See, we have got common 
ground already. 
But it is interesting to me, and I am 
astounded at times, how we see some 
things so similar and some things so 
different—hard issues at times. 
Let me give you a Rorschach test. 
Can I do that? You know a Rorschach

test, the ink blot? Let me give you a 
Rorschach test. 
What do you see in that picture? I see 
a child when I look at it. That looks a 
lot like a baby to me. Now, you may 
look at it and say, ‘‘I don’t see it. I see 
a castle or I see clouds,’’ but in this 
particular Rorschach test, it happens 
to be a modern sonogram of a child. 
Why do I bring this up? Why do I 
bring this to the floor today? 
It is fascinating to me on the debate 
today that as a Republican I can be ac-
cused over and over of not caring about 
the challenges of voting in America, 
when I would be willing to ask the 
question: Does this child get to vote 18 
years from now or does she get dis-
posed of? What happens to her? 
I do believe every life matters, no 
matter how old or how young, how 
small or how big, regardless of race or 
color or national origin or sex or abil-
ity. All people have inherent value. All 
people have worth and all should be 
protected in America. This is the 
United States of America. 
And that child matters. Forty-nine 
years ago, the Roe v. Wade decision 
was made. It is coming up this Friday, 
the 49th anniversary, actually. That is 
why I bring it up. 
There will be tens of thousands of 
students out for the March for Life. It 
will be an absolutely spectacular and 
beautiful display of dignity and value 
of every single human life. 
In 1973, just a few months after that 
decision was handed down, Nellie Gray 
and some other pro-life leaders like the 
Knights 
of 
Columbus 
and 
other 
groups—they decided that one way 
they could continue the national dia-
logue about children was the March for 
Life until Roe v. Wade was overturned. 
And I am going to march again with 
them this year, and it will be freezing 
cold again this year, like it usually is 
in late January. 
A lot has changed since 1973. Times 
have changed the conversation on abor-
tion. Where it used to focus on cells 
and tissue and viability, now science 
recognizes that babies can feel pain, 
have a beating heart. That child al-
ready has fingerprints, in fact. By that 
age right there. It already has finger-
prints. 
By conception, that child has DNA 
that is different than the mom’s and 
different than the dad’s. Every single 
person in this room was once in your 
mom’s womb, and the only difference 
between you now and you then is time. 
That is it. 
And I will be very blunt, my greatest 
hope is that, after 49 years, this will be 
the last March for Life in a Roe v. 
Wade America; that this will return 
back to the States to be able to make 
decisions. 
In my State, we will step up to this 
Rorschach test, and we will say, ‘‘That 
looks like a baby to me,’’ and we will 
start protecting the value of every sin-
gle child. 
We have brought bills to this floor 
that have been filibustered, bills on 
conscience protection, just giving the 
rights of a nurse—of a nurse—who told 
her employer, ‘‘I don’t want to perform 
abortions. I have a conscience issue 
with that,’’ and then was hired, and 
later, her hospital said, ‘‘You have to 
participate in this abortion.’’ 
We have laws in America that pro-
tect that. They just have no teeth at 
all. So individuals do get forced into 
performing abortions against their con-
science. We brought that to the floor, 
but it got filibustered. 
We brought to the floor the protec-
tions of children in the womb who have 
Down syndrome; that they couldn’t be 
aborted simply because they have 
Down syndrome, but guess what. That 
got filibustered and blocked. 
We brought bills to the floor saying 
that if a child was born alive in a 
botched abortion, they had to get med-
ical care, but it got filibustered and 
blocked. 
By the way, I wish the people in this 
room had the opportunity to meet 
some of the folks whom I have had the 
opportunity to be able to meet who are 
abortion survivors because I hear from 
people all the time: That never hap-
pens. That never happens. I would like 
you to meet some of them who literally 
survived a botched abortion, that they 
were delivered alive and someone in 
the room took them to the hospital in 
their own vehicle, usually, and they 
survived. 
I wish you had the opportunity to be 
able to sit down with Dr. Alveda King. 
The daughter of Dr. King is a great 
civil rights leader, and, yes, it is the 
niece of that Dr. King you are thinking 
of, who is an outspoken proponent for 
life and speaks often of grace to people. 
I wish we had the opportunity to be 
able to talk more about chemical abor-
tions and what is actually happening in 
that industry, where people are lit-
erally being mailed drugs from all over 
the world to be able to perform abor-
tions at their homes or in their dorm 
rooms or hotel rooms, where this child 
is being delivered into a toilet and 
flushed; about how we have a much 
larger incidence of deaths of moms in 
chemical abortions than there is in 
surgical abortions; and about the sta-
tistics that have been kept, which, by 
the way, were blocked from being kept 
and are other than just deaths. From 
2007 to 2017, there were 3,800 what they 
call adverse events from chemical 
abortions that had occurred. 
Why do I bring all of this up? 
I bring it up because this week, we 
are going to remember 49 years of Roe 
v. Wade, and we are going to start a 
dialogue in the days ahead about how 
States are going to handle life and 
what that Rorschach test is. Is that a 
baby or a tissue? We will have to face 
that reality. 
I bring it up because it is a rare mo-
ment for us to have a real, bipartisan 
conversation 
today. 
As 
the 
body 
knows, it is not often we all sit in our 
chairs and actually talk to each other. 
We 
typically 
talk 
to 
each 
other 
through the media rather than talk to 
each other in here. 
I brought it up because the conversa-
tion about her has been filibustered 
over and over and over and over again, 
and we don’t get to have a real debate 
about her. We just move on. 
When do we get to have a conversa-
tion about her—that is, a real dia-
logue—and determine what direction 
we go as a nation? For her sake, I hope 
it is soon because she matters. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I dis-
agree with the last speaker’s charac-
terization of the issue he was bringing 
up, but I want to stay focused on vot-
ing rights because this is an important 
moment for the U.S. Senate. 
This is our opportunity to debate the 
need for voting protection and voting 
rights, but I do want to make one com-
ment. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle have said that they welcome 
an opportunity to debate voting rights 
legislation and talk about ways that 
we can get this bill to have bipartisan 
support. 
The majority leader, several weeks 
ago, offered a motion to proceed on 
voting rights. He filed cloture so that 
we could get on the bill and have the 
type of debate that my colleagues now 
are telling us they want to have, and 
not a single Republican voted to pro-
ceed on voting rights legislation at 
that time. So I find it a little bit dis-
heartening to hear this newfound de-
sire to start taking up voting rights 
when we have been negotiating and 
talking and debating this issue now for 
this entire Congress. We also have a 
historic opportunity to vote on voting 
rights if we take advantage of that op-
portunity. 
I represent the State of Maryland, 
and I know we have talked about 19 
States that are moving in the wrong 
direction on protecting voting rights. 
Maryland is not one of those States. In 
fact, the Maryland Legislature has 
taken steps to make it easier for voters 
to be able to register and cast their 
votes. 
The Voting Rights Act was authored 
by my Congressman, JOHN SARBANES, 
and I am proud of the work that he has 
done because Marylanders recognize 
that we administer elections locally 
but that we need national standards, 
and that is why this legislation is 
under consideration. 
After the Civil War and Reconstruc-
tion, powerful officials sought to nul-
lify the political outcome of the Civil 
War. They passed laws and instituted 
policies that enforced segregation. We 
all know those laws: the Jim Crow 
laws, the Black Codes, the institu-
tionalized segregation. They were en-
abled by Jim Crow laws that were 
aimed at disenfranchising minority 
voters with poll taxes and literacy 
tests and voter intimidation—rational-
ized in protecting our national security 
and voter integrity.

January 19, 2022 
Thanks to courageous leaders, we 
were able to reverse those laws—by 
Presidents such as Harry Truman, in 
1948, in integrating our military; by 
our courts in the landmark decision in 
1954 of Brown v. Board of Education, 
and Marylanders are proud of Thurgood 
Marshall, a native son of Maryland’s, 
in the role that he played in arguing 
that case before the Supreme Court; 
and by our Congress with its historic 
action in 1964 to pass the Civil Rights 
Act, in 1965 to pass the Voting Rights 
Act, and in 1968 to pass the Fair Hous-
ing Act. 
Today, we are now seeing a renewed 
effort for Jim Crow-type laws, aimed at 
disenfranchising targeted voters. My 
colleagues have talked about it, and I 
am not going to repeat it here today 
because I know that time is running 
short. We know that these laws are 
aimed at making it more difficult for 
minority communities to be able to 
cast their votes. My colleague from 
New Jersey talked about students. 
Marginal groups are targeted because 
those who are enacting these laws 
think it will help them politically. 
Why now? The answer is pretty simple: 
the 2020 election. It was an election in 
which more people voted than ever be-
fore, and it was judged to be the most 
secure election in American history. 
But because Donald Trump lost, for the 
first time in the history of this Nation, 
we had the loser claim that the elec-
tion was stolen in order to rationalize 
his loss. 
That Big Lie is what motivated legis-
latures to pass laws to make it more 
difficult for vulnerable people to be 
able to vote, to effect election results, 
presenting a clear danger to our de-
mocracy itself on voter integrity and 
in the confidence of voters that our 
system is actually working. 
Now is the time for the Senate to 
show courage to debate, as we are 
doing today, and to vote on two bills. 
The Freedom to Vote Act sets min-
imum Federal standards with State-ad-
ministered election laws. We have gone 
through all of the different provisions, 
so I am not going to go through them 
again, but we need to have these na-
tional standards because of the actions 
of these 19 States and other reasons, 
such as the dark money that my col-
league from Rhode Island pointed out, 
voter intimidation issues, and restor-
ing democracy. There are so many 
issues that are in it that are important 
in order to restore voter confidence. 
We need to pass the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act to re-
store the Voting Rights Act, because of 
the Supreme Court’s decision, and re-
store precertification. 
As has been put out by my col-
leagues, this has been historically sup-
ported by both Democrats and Repub-
licans. Again, we need one Republican 
to vote to proceed to this, for those 
who are saying they are willing to de-
bate this issue. Today, Senators will 
have the opportunity to vote and to be 
on the right side of history. 
The Senate filibuster prevented the 
passage of civil rights legislation to re-
verse the Jim Crow laws until, finally, 
in 1964, the filibuster ended, and the 
Senate voted. 
By invoking cloture, we can vote now 
to protect the voting rights of Ameri-
cans. We can do it right now by passing 
cloture and being on the right side of 
history. If cloture is denied, we will 
have the opportunity to restore the 
Senate to its best traditions—to debate 
and vote; to require those who want to 
use rule XIX—and rule XIX is our fili-
buster rule—to actually be on the floor 
and debate. No more pocket filibusters. 
As for the Senate rules changes that 
we have all been talking about—and I 
have been listening to my colleagues— 
let me just talk a little bit about 
changing Senate practice—let alone a 
constitutional issue, such as voting 
rights, should have priority over any of 
the procedural issues that we have here 
on the floor of the Senate and let alone 
restoring the Senate to a working body 
should have priority over the interpre-
tations of some of our rules. Let me 
talk about the rule itself. 
If you look at the 20th century, basi-
cally, legislation was considered on the 
floor of the Senate through comity and 
debate and compromise, and we were 
able to bring issues to the floor for a 
vote. Rarely—very rarely—was a fili-
buster used. Why? Because you had to 
come to the floor and talk. It was very 
time-consuming. It took a lot of time 
off the Senate floor. It was inconven-
ient for the Member to have to stand 
up here and talk. So we were able to 
come together. It wasn’t through a clo-
ture vote that it ended; it ended be-
cause people didn’t want to go through 
the inconvenience of talking or we 
were able to resolve it. 
We are talking about restoring the 
Senate to its best traditions. Many 
have talked about, we are going to 
change the filibuster rule. No, we are 
not suggesting changing the filibuster 
rule. The filibuster rule is coming to 
the floor to speak. It is the cloture 
that is the 60 votes. You don’t need clo-
ture if you run the clock on the fili-
buster. 
What we need to do is prevent dila-
tory actions, and that is why the lead-
er’s point is going to be important. We 
are trying to restore the Senate to a 
body that can work together by requir-
ing that Members come to the floor 
and speak and vote by how the Fram-
ers of the Senate rules intended at the 
end of the day. 
To my friend from West Virginia, 
this gives us the chance to start to 
work together. I couldn’t agree with 
him more. We do need to come together 
in a bipartisan way and let our com-
mittees work. We need to look into the 
Senate rules. But we first need to move 
on action, and this is a fundamental 
bill that we need to move forward. 
The leader is framing this in a very 
narrow way so he can get this bill mov-
ing and use this as an example to work 
together, Democrats and Republicans, 
so the Senate can restore its practices 
and so we all can be proud Members of 
a body that debates and votes. That is 
what we can do while respecting each 
Member’s rights and respecting minor-
ity rights. 
I urge my colleagues to support clo-
ture and, if cloture fails, to support the 
leader’s point and be on the right side 
of history. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, infla-
tion is at its highest level in 40 years. 
Drug overdose deaths and illegal border 
crossings are at record levels. The mur-
der rate is its highest since the 1990s. 
Russian 
troops 
are 
massing 
on 
Ukraine’s border, and the President of 
the United States just green-lighted 
Vladimir Putin to invade. China is con-
tinuing its aggression. 
So what have the Democratic floor 
leader and Senate Democrats spent the 
last 2 months doing? Trying to over-
turn 200 years of Senate rules and cus-
toms so that they can do things like 
ban voter ID nationwide and use your 
tax dollars to support political cam-
paigns. 
They tell us that Americans are liv-
ing under Jim Crow 2.0, and they cite 
the recent Georgia election law as 
proof. Well, let’s investigate this so- 
called voter suppression law. 
Under the new law, the State of 
Georgia will have 17 days of early vot-
ing. If this is Jim Crow 2.0, then I have 
bad news because the Democratic lead-
er’s home State of New York and the 
President’s home State of Delaware 
were engaged in I guess what you 
would call Jim Crow 3.0 as recently as 
last year because New York only had 9 
days of early voting and Delaware had 
no days—zero days—of early voting. 
Next, I have heard complaints that 
Georgia has reduced the number of bal-
lot drop boxes in the State, even 
though they now require every county 
to have a drop box, as was not the case 
as recently as 2018, and that Georgia 
has added new security measures to 
prevent fraud. 
Once again, I hate to break the news 
that the Democratic floor leader’s 
home State of New York had zero bal-
lot drop boxes and that the President’s 
home State of Delaware allowed for 
just five last year. 
Of course, one of the Democrats’ fa-
vorite claims is that all of those ter-
rible Republicans down in Georgia have 
stopped campaign and political work-
ers from giving food and drinks to peo-
ple who are waiting in line at the polls. 
Where could Georgia have gotten such 
an idea? Well, as it turns out, the 
Democratic floor leader’s home State 
of New York also has a nearly identical 
law banning such electioneering near 
polling places. 
The Democrats also say that voter ID 
is a kind of new Jim Crow. That might 
surprise the 69 percent of Black Ameri-
cans who support voter ID.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S320 
January 19, 2022 
Now, what are they up to? This is an 
especially good question, given the let-
ter that 28 Democrats, still in the Sen-
ate, signed on April 7, 2017, to the lead-
ership around here, urging them to op-
pose any effort—any effort—to stop the 
Senate’s tradition and custom of ex-
tended debate. 
Some of those Senators are on the 
floor with us at this moment. I see the 
junior Senator from Illinois, the junior 
Senator from Hawaii, and the junior 
Senator from Maine, the Presiding Of-
ficer, for that matter. Many more were 
down here earlier. 
I would invite, through the Chair, 
any of those Senators, if they would 
like to engage in a colloquy, to explain 
why they have changed their position 
since they signed that letter on April 7, 
2017. 
I guess I don’t have any takers. 
I will point out that out of the 28 
Democrats who actually signed that 
letter— 
Mr. KING. Will the Senator yield? 
Mr. COTTON. I will certainly yield. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Maine. 
Mr. KING. I am one who signed that 
letter. 
First, let’s talk about the letter 
itself. What it says is, ‘‘We are united 
in our determination to preserve the 
ability of Members to engage in ex-
tended debate when bills are on the 
Senate floor.’’ I agree with that. The 
proposal that is going to be put on the 
floor today is one that will allow ex-
tended debate. 
There are two points that have 
caused me to modify the position that 
I took on this letter. One is the nature 
of the issue that is before the body. If 
we were here talking about immigra-
tion or gun control or any of the other 
many 
issues 
that 
we 
consider, 
I 
wouldn’t be taking the position that I 
am. 
I believe that the rules of the Senate 
are important and that extended de-
bate is an important part of the Senate 
process. However, we are talking about 
fundamental structural changes—not 
policy 
changes 
but 
structural 
changes—that I believe, in spite of 
your comments, that in many States 
across the country are compromising 
the ability of our people to express 
themselves in our democracy. 
I consider that qualitatively different 
than a policy difference, and that is 
why I am here today to talk about re-
vising the rules—not blowing up the 
filibuster but to get back to what the 
filibuster actually means, and that is 
extended debate. 
I am all for extended debate until we 
are exhausted, until we have made a 
deal, until we have come to a com-
promise. But the problem is, the fili-
buster, as we define it today, is a dis-
tant cousin of the real filibuster. 
The radical change in the filibuster 
isn’t what is being discussed today. It 
was made in 1975 almost by accident. In 
1975, they were debating whether it 
should 
be 
two-thirds 
of 
Senators 
present and voting or a lower number. 
And they compromised on 60 Senators, 
sworn Members. That was the focus of 
that discussion. 
I have talked to Parliamentarians 
who were involved in that question. I 
asked the specific question: Did they 
really realize what they were doing by 
creating the mail-in, dial-in, no-effort 
filibuster? And the answer was no. 
They didn’t discuss it. They didn’t 
think of it. 
So what I am talking about here 
today and what the proposal that will 
be on the floor later today is to do ex-
actly what this letter says, ‘‘extended 
debate’’—‘‘extended debate.’’ And that 
is why I believe that what we are pro-
posing today is in the deepest tradition 
of the U.S. Senate. What we are trying 
to scale back is the cheap, easy, dial-in 
from your office, 60 votes, de facto, 
supermajority requirement, which is 
not in the Constitution, which the 
Framers expressly did not agree to. 
They put in a lot of checks and bal-
ances. Two Houses of Congress, two- 
thirds voting on treaties, two-thirds 
voting on an amendment, confirmation 
of the President—the President, the 
Congress, the independence of the 
courts, all those were checks and bal-
ances. One of them was not a super-
majority requirement in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
Hamilton and Madison expressly said 
that that would turn democracy on its 
head. Democracy ultimately is about 
majority rule, and there should be mi-
nority rights. The minority should 
have every opportunity to speak, to 
offer amendments, to discuss—to offer 
germane amendments, I might add— 
and discuss and debate but ultimately 
not have a veto. 
That is really what it comes down to 
here: Do you have a rule that says that 
the minority actually is in control of 
the legislative process? That is not 
what the Framers intended. It is anti-
thetical to what the Framers intended. 
In fact, one of the reasons for the 
Constitutional Convention was the dys-
function of the Articles of Confed-
eration, and one of the reasons cited 
for that dysfunction was a super-
majority requirement. 
So, yes, I voted—what I supported 3 
years ago, I still support. The language 
is ‘‘full, robust, and extended debate,’’ 
and that is what is going to be pro-
posed later on. 
If you guys will vote for it, this de-
bate can go on, as it should, for weeks 
and perhaps months because it is that 
important. But I don’t have any apolo-
gies to make. If I have to choose be-
tween a Senate rule, as it works now— 
which, as I say, is a distant cousin of 
the 
real 
filibuster—and 
democracy 
itself, I am going to take democracy 
every single time. 
Mr. COTTON. Well, I thank the Sen-
ator from Maine for explaining the 
change in position. I was not seeking 
an apology, merely an explanation, 
since I haven’t heard that much over 
the last year or so. 
I can respond to a few of these points. 
The Senator from Maine said it was the 
nature of the issue at stake. Well, first 
off, I will point out, I have the letter in 
front of me here. It is very short. It is 
only two paragraphs long, but there is 
nothing in there about the nature of 
the issue at stake, about whether we 
are talking about immigration or gun 
control or, in this case, election take-
over laws. 
The Senator from Maine referred to 
the cheap and easy filibuster. I don’t 
necessarily agree with that character-
ization, but I would point out that that 
is exactly the kind of cheap and easy 
filibuster that was in place in 2017, 
when 28 Democrats signed this letter. 
I will also point out that I wouldn’t 
necessarily agree with the character-
ization that the current filibuster was 
created by accident in 1975. We are 
going to have a debate, but the rules 
and customs under debate today go 
back to the second decade, the second 
decade of the U.S. Senate. And, perhaps 
more importantly, every time those 
rules have been modified—up to and in-
cluding the most recent changes on the 
legislative calendar—they have been 
modified in accordance with the rules, 
not using the nuclear option, breaking 
the rules so we can change the rules. 
I also note we have had a few other 
signatories to that letter arrive. We 
have the senior Senator from Colorado. 
We have the senior Senator from New 
Hampshire. We have the senior Senator 
from Montana. And we have the let-
ter’s chief Democratic author, the jun-
ior Senator from Delaware. 
I asked earlier, through the Chair, if 
any Senators would like to explain 
their change in position. Since those 
Senators have joined us, if they would 
like to explain their change, as well, I 
would invite them into colloquy. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Would the Senator 
yield? 
Mr. COTTON. I would be happy to 
yield. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you. I am 
struck by your comment that in all 
previous situations, the rules have 
been modified by a change in the rules 
that has been done through the rules 
process because—I would encourage 
you to read up on your Senate his-
tory—it is just not the case. 
In fact, under Senator Byrd’s leader-
ship, nine times this Chamber changed 
the interpretation of existing rules, 
and they didn’t do it through a formal 
rules change process. They did it with 
an interpretation of the Chair being 
sustained or by reversing the interpre-
tation of the Chair. 
And you have been here when a nu-
clear option modified the rules. Your 
party led the effort to change the re-
quirement for closing debate on the Su-
preme Court. And you have been here— 
or I think you were here; your col-
leagues were here—when they changed 
the rule, not by changing the rule for-
mally but by reinterpreting it through 
a nuclear option, in regard to decreas-
ing the number of hours for debate on 
district judges.

It also goes back to the fact that 
your team changed the rules, without 
going through the formal rule process, 
on how reconciliation is done in order 
to be able to do tax cuts for the rich. 
And then Kent Conrad, on our side, ad-
vocated the change back, and your 
side, in preparation for the Trump tax 
cuts in 2017, changed the rule again. 
So at least let us understand that 
both 
sides—Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans—have resorted to reinterpreting 
the rules on various occasions. Just a 
point of clarification that your state-
ment was wrong. 
Mr. COTTON. I appreciate the com-
ments of the Senator from Oregon. And 
I want to commend him for principled 
consistency on this question. He did 
not sign that letter. 
In fact, one of the earliest conversa-
tions I had with any Democratic Sen-
ator in 2015 was with the Senator from 
Oregon about some of these very ques-
tions. He has had these reservations 
about the cloture rule, about the rights 
and customs of extended debate. He has 
not changed his on this position so I 
commend him. 
I will point out, he mentioned the nu-
clear option on the Supreme Court. Of 
course, that simply followed what the 
former 
Senate 
Democratic 
leader 
Harry Reid did in 2013 on the Executive 
Calendar. 
I will also point out that that hap-
pened in February or March of 2017, if 
I recall. This letter was written in 
April of 2017. 
But if there is no more extended de-
bate on this question—oh, I would in-
vite 
the 
Senator 
from 
Virginia, 
through the Chair. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, if I might 
respond. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Senator COTTON, what 
ANGUS said. 
And I am so glad that Senator 
LANKFORD has stayed in the room be-
cause you have been saying we changed 
our position. You just really need to 
read the letter. And I do appreciate 
that you put it up because others were 
referring to the letter without doing 
that. The operative phrase is exactly 
what you read: ‘‘We are united in our 
determination to preserve the ability 
of Members to engage in extended de-
bate when bills are on the Senate 
floor.’’ 
We couldn’t even debate this bill. 
You guys wouldn’t let us. You kept 
using the 60-vote block on the motion 
to proceed so that we couldn’t get on 
the bill. 
In the 5 years since 2017, many of us 
have come to realize, this is what we 
want, but the current abuse of Senate 
rules is blocking us from having discus-
sions about voting rights or about mat-
ters that you think are important. 
This is still what we want. We want 
the ability to have extended debate 
when bills are on the Senate floor. 
That is what the motion will eventu-
ally be about when we vote on it later 
today, to move to a talking filibuster 
instead of a secret filibuster. 
The way to look at the rule change 
that we are going to contemplate later 
is, if you really love the filibuster—and 
the word ‘‘filibuster’’ isn’t in this let-
ter at all, but if you really love the fili-
buster, do you demand that it stay se-
cret or should it be carried out open, 
publicly, in view of the voters and your 
Senate colleagues? That is what the 
vote will be. 
We have listened to those of you who 
have said don’t abolish the filibuster, 
don’t nuke the filibuster, don’t blow up 
the filibuster, don’t weaken the fili-
buster, and the only change we propose 
is that the filibuster be a public fili-
buster, not a secret one. 
So you stood on the floor and asked 
if we would join you in that operative 
phrase, ‘‘engage in extended debate 
when bills are on the Senate floor.’’ 
The combination of the block on the 
motion to proceed, together with the 
paper pocket filibuster, where people 
do not have to show up to speak, much 
less to vote, we can restore the fili-
buster, frankly, to what it was during 
the vast majority of the Senate’s his-
tory and require that people actually 
do it and be accountable to their col-
leagues and to the public. And that is 
what we propose to do. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I invite 
the Senator from Colorado to engage in 
colloquy. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Thank you, I appre-
ciate that from the Senator from Ar-
kansas. 
Just along the lines of what my col-
leagues have said, I would also say that 
I want to be very clear that I don’t 
want this place to turn into the House 
of Representatives. I think that would 
be a huge mistake. But it is not behav-
ing the way that the Founders designed 
it to behave. 
And 
the 
history, 
admittedly, 
is 
opaque, but it is very clear to me that 
the modern abuse of the filibuster rep-
resents very little in the way of tradi-
tional Senate practice or what the 
Framers were considering. 
So I can imagine finding ourselves in 
a place where we actually have ex-
tended debate, where we actually have 
a public filibuster like we used to 
have—everybody remembers the movie 
version of that; they actually did that 
on the floor of the Senate—versus the 
secret filibuster that acts as a per-
petual veto by the minority on the ma-
jority, something that the Framers 
clearly were trying to avoid and, at the 
same time, gives the minority the 
chance to hold the floor, persuade the 
American people of their point of view, 
amend legislation in ways that is un-
imaginable in the House and then, in 
the end, gives the majority the chance 
to actually make a decision so we can 
effectively compete with countries all 
over the world that aren’t held up by 
the kind of veto we are talking about. 
There is not a legislative body in the 
world that I am aware of, in any of the 
other countries with which we com-
pete, that has a filibuster. 
So I would say that other piece of 
this, the idea that we are going to see-
saw back and forth and back and forth 
and back and forth—I think the reality 
is that is not the reality of what hap-
pens in other places that don’t have 
the filibuster. And I believe we have 
the opportunity, if we are actually hav-
ing a public debate—not sitting in our 
office or off fundraising but, instead, 
having a public debate on the floor of 
this Senate—that the American people 
can actually begin to hold people here 
accountable again for their position on 
healthcare or guns or whatever it is. 
We don’t ever get the chance to do 
that here because we never even have a 
debate in the world’s most deliberative 
body. 
So if we have a disagreement tonight 
about the form of all this, my hope is 
that, in the wake of this, if we are not 
successful, we actually do the Amer-
ican people a favor by creating a set of 
rules that actually will make this 
place work. 
I have been here now for 12 years. It 
is hard to believe. I can tell you, the 
Senate doesn’t work. It can’t get its 
basic business done, much less make 
hard decisions. I think we can do better 
than that, and I hope we will. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, the Sen-
ator from Oklahoma was directly ad-
dressed, and I believe he would like to 
engage in a brief colloquy. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
thank my friend, through the Chair, 
the Senator from Virginia, for the en-
gagement. We will continue to be able 
to engage and be able to talk through 
this. 
Part of our challenge on dealing with 
this dialogue today is none of our side 
has actually seen the proposal tonight. 
It is a secret proposal that is coming 
out that all the conversation is that 
this restores the talking filibuster. 
We are like: Really? What does it 
say? 
Then, in the next, I guess, couple of 
hours, there is going to be a proposal 
pop and say, ‘‘Here it is; we are chang-
ing the rules of the Senate with a 51 
vote,’’ when we haven’t even had the 
opportunity to even see it. 
So we talk about trying to be able to 
bring dialogue and debate on all of 
these things. That is not dialogue and 
debate on the rules. That is trying to 
ram through a change with a straight 
51 that none of us have even seen. 
And as we go through this, you had 
mentioned before the letter that is out 
there. You are correct. I read through 
the letter. I have definitely read 
through the whole letter, but I could 
have also brought a bunch of quotes 
from folks that I see all around the 
room that make statements like, ‘‘I 
will never change the legislative fili-
buster,’’ or, ‘‘I am 100 percent opposed

to changing the legislative filibuster,’’ 
or, ‘‘We should not change the fili-
buster using the nuclear option.’’ 
So there were lots of other quotes 
from lots of other interviews because, 
obviously, around 2017, when the letter 
came out, there was lots of media that 
asked point-blank: What do you mean 
by that? 
And so there is a lot of clarification 
with it. So you are right. I read the let-
ter, and it has the vague language. But 
I could have read lots of quotes that we 
have that were very, very specific on 
it. 
At the end of the day, if we are going 
to solve the issues in the Senate, we 
are going to have to actually work to-
gether to be able to solve the issues. 
What makes this the greatest delibera-
tive body is not that 51 can do what 
they want. What will make it the 
greatest deliberative body is when we 
have to actually talk to each other. 
When I was elected in 2014, most of 
the phone calls that came to me per-
sonally between November and Janu-
ary were some of you who called me 
and said: My name is . . . . We are 
going to disagree on a lot of things, but 
let’s start working now on what we will 
agree on. 
If we start doing away with these 
rules and just move it to a 51 basis, 
those conversations end and it is not a 
deliberative body. Suddenly, it is a ‘‘we 
can get what we want with 51’’ body. 
That is the House. That is why we 
bring it up. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, before I 
move on from this letter, I just have to 
note that, as I have said several times, 
28 Democrats in the Senate today 
signed that letter. Twenty-seven of 
them changed their position. There is 
one signatory who didn’t change their 
position: the Senator from West Vir-
ginia. Not only did he not change his 
position in that letter he signed, he has 
been consistent from the very begin-
ning. 
He was also here in 2013 when we 
started down this path on the Execu-
tive Calendar. And there are dif-
ferences, to be sure, between the Exec-
utive Calendar and the legislative cal-
endar. The Senator from West Virginia 
is the sole signatory still in the Senate 
who has been consistent throughout, 
and I want to commend him for that. 
And I want to note for the record the 
Senator from Arizona—apparently, the 
only other Democratic Senator who 
will oppose this maneuver—did not 
sign the letter in 2017 because she was 
not in the Senate in 2017. 
So, in conclusion, why are we doing 
all this? Why are we going down this 
road? Is it because this legislation is so 
popular, this issue is so important? 
You would think it was the top issue 
on the minds of a majority of Ameri-
cans. But no, according to Gallup, only 
1 percent of Americans list elections 
and Federal election takeovers as their 
top priority. 
Maybe the majority of Americans 
support the procedural maneuvering 
here tonight, the overturning of 200 
years of Senate rules and customs— 
nope, wrong again. According to a re-
cent CBS poll, barely a third of Ameri-
cans support this. 
And while we are waiting here for the 
Democrats’ doomed charge to overturn 
200 years of Senate rules and customs 
and federalize our elections, Americans 
are dealing with very real, concrete, 
kitchen-table issues. Our people are 
getting poorer. Inflation rose by 7 per-
cent over the last year, the highest 
rate in 40 years. Wages are failing to 
keep up. Inflation might not be so bad 
for some of the millionaires around 
here, with their stock portfolios and 
their real estate, but for most Ameri-
cans it is crippling, and it is most crip-
pling for those who can least afford it. 
I shouldn’t have to point out that 
people are dying in our communities 
all across the country. Murder was up 
by its highest record level in the keep-
ing of modern records last year, and it 
is up again this year, at a time when 
we also have 100,000 Americans dying of 
overdoses, the highest number ever re-
ported—another grim record. 
Meanwhile, America is being over-
whelmed at our southern border. Bor-
der Patrol is stopping more than 175,000 
illegal immigrants at our southern bor-
der each month. We can only guess how 
many more are getting through. 
These are all the real problems that 
the American people have told us re-
peatedly they want us to address, but 
we haven’t heard much about those 
problems. We are not here in session 
this week to debate those problems. 
The Democrats apparently don’t want 
to acknowledge these crises because 
they created these crises and they have 
no solution for these crises. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Just briefly, Mr. Presi-
dent, I know I was not scheduled to 
speak, but I do want to respond as one 
of the signatories of the letter. 
I associate myself with everything 
that the other signatories have talked 
about in terms of wanting to restore 
the Senate’s tradition of extended de-
bate on issues of grave importance to 
the American people. But let me be 
clear about the reason that I now sup-
port an adjustment to the longstanding 
rules of the Senate. It is because I 
never imagined, when I signed that let-
ter, that not a single Member of the 
Republican Party would stand up for 
our democracy since January 6, when 
we saw an acceleration of State laws 
that would allow partisans to overturn 
the impartial count of an election. 
We need to address the issues that so 
many of us have talked about here. The 
people of New Hampshire, the people 
all across the country, they need us to 
address pressing issues like lowering 
the cost of prescription drugs or mak-
ing it easy for families to afford 
childcare. 
But if we do not have a functioning 
democracy where people know that, 
when they vote, that vote will be im-
partially counted and upheld and that 
people who are defeated will accept de-
feat so that they can have an account-
able elected representation in Wash-
ington, then there is no democracy. 
When I signed that letter, I never 
imagined 
that 
today’s 
Republican 
Party would fail to stand up for democ-
racy. 
I was raised by a veteran of the Bat-
tle of the Bulge. He would talk to us at 
the breakfast table, and the question 
was, ‘‘What are you going to do for 
freedom today?’’ It was a big question 
to ask elementary schoolkids, to be 
sure, but he had a right to ask it, as 
does every veteran who has fought for 
this country, including my colleague 
Senator COTTON. 
But the Republican Party and the 
Democratic Party must unite to stand 
for freedom and to stand for an ac-
countable democracy because, without 
that, the rules of this body do not mat-
ter. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
can’t think of a more important thing 
to be debating here in these Chambers 
than the right to vote. We can’t even 
get to that. We can’t even get to that 
because of the use of the filibuster to 
prevent us from having a vote, a dis-
cussion, on the Voting Rights Act. 
In America, the path toward justice 
has always, always been intertwined 
with the right to vote. Progress and en-
franchisement have always been braid-
ed together. 
Billy 
clubs, 
whips, 
barbed 
wire, 
wrapped tubing—that is what awaited 
John Lewis at the end of that Edmund 
Pettus Bridge in Selma because it has 
never been easy—it has never been 
easy—to fight for enfranchisement or 
to fight for the right to vote. There has 
always been a price to pay by those 
who focus on justice. 
Shouted slurs, explosions of tear gas, 
pained screams, and the crack of clubs 
against bone—those were the sounds 
that filled the air as Lewis and hun-
dreds of his fellow Americans tried to 
march forward as they tried to bring 
their country forward one step at a 
time. 
Most of us in this room know of 
those mothers and fathers of the civil 
rights movement, what they did for us 
that day. They raised their voice on 
that bridge so that fellow Americans 
could raise their voices at the ballot 
box. Tragically, we also know that 
many in this Chamber today appear 
unwilling to do their part to protect 
the rights those heroes fought for. 
More than a half century ago, in this 
very building, Senators from both sides 
of the aisle came together to pass the 
Voting Rights Act, a bill designed to 
protect Black Americans—to protect 
all Americans—from the kind of racial 
discrimination that was so common in 
State-run elections at that time. 
Of course, it is not possible to list 
out all the changes that have taken

place since that moment. More and 
more civil rights advocates stood up 
and sat in. More and more Americans 
marched through and then laid down in 
the streets. And the moral arc of the 
universe that Dr. Martin Luther King 
spoke of bent a little more toward jus-
tice with every hard-earned right they 
secured and every fight that they won. 
But, sadly, damningly, one other 
change stands out to me as I speak 
here today. More than 50 years after 
the Voting Rights Act became law, we 
can no longer say that a bipartisan ma-
jority of the Senate is willing to pro-
tect the most basic tenet of our democ-
racy. Heck, we don’t even have all of 
the Senators in the room to discuss 
this. Every American’s right to make 
their voice heard is so critically impor-
tant to our democracy. We can’t say 
this because Senate Republicans have 
spent the past year blocking every 
Democratic attempt to even begin de-
bate on strengthening voter legisla-
tion. 
Even as Republicans in States around 
the country pass more and more re-
strictive voter suppression laws aimed 
at silencing the voice of the people, we 
still struggle and beg to have this de-
bate, and they will not vote to allow us 
to do so. 
Republicans in Georgia made it ille-
gal to peremptorily mail out absentee 
mail out absentee ballots to registered 
voters, a law that hurts all groups that 
rely on voting by mail, from commu-
nities of color to Americans living with 
disabilities. 
It also hurts military voters cur-
rently serving in harm’s way overseas. 
I myself voted by mail when I was serv-
ing our country in Iraq. After all, I was 
a little busy flying combat missions, so 
I don’t know if I would have had the 
chance to request an absentee ballot 15 
days before the election if my unit had 
not assisted in that effort. Not every 
unit may do that. And so not having 
their ballots mailed to them would 
make it immeasurably harder for our 
troops to vote wherever they may be 
serving. 
I can’t understand why Republicans 
would want to make it harder for brave 
Americans, defending our democracy 
abroad, to participate in it, but that is 
what they are doing. 
And I can’t understand how my Re-
publican colleagues can sit here today 
and ask paid staffers and pages to bring 
them water, at exactly the tempera-
ture they like, with or without ice, 
sparkling or not sparkling, as they 
make their voices heard on the Senate 
floor and then say nothing—nothing— 
to stop a law that makes it illegal to 
give water to Americans waiting hours 
in line at polling stations as they seek 
to simply have their voices heard at 
the ballot box. 
Listen, my five-times great-grand-
fathers, who were likely indentured 
servants without the right to vote, 
didn’t fight in the Revolutionary War 
and earn that right to vote just so peo-
ple claiming to be the leaders of our 
generation could chip away at the fun-
damental idea that founded this Na-
tion: that everyone is equal. 
And my buddies and I and Senator 
COTTON didn’t sign up to defend our de-
mocracy in war zones thousands of 
miles away only to watch it crumble at 
the hands of powerful people more fo-
cused on their own self-interests than 
in the foundational component of this 
extraordinary experiment that we call 
America; that everyone, regardless of 
social status, wealth, skin color, sex, 
has a right to vote. 
Page after page in our Nation’s his-
tory is marred by bigotry, tainted by 
intolerance, by injustice, but through 
every 
chapter—however 
dark 
the 
night—some 
brave 
Americans 
have 
willed that there would be light. 
That march forward has always been 
to expand access to the polls, not to de-
crease it—expanded access for those 
who didn’t own land, for Black Ameri-
cans after the Civil War, for women, for 
all Americans. 
In World War II, Black Americans 
fought overseas for the same country 
that forced their families to sit at seg-
regated lunch counters back home. 
Then they came home and were forced 
to guess how many jelly beans were in 
a jar before they, themselves, could 
vote in a country that they had fought 
for. 
Asian Americans fought to end slav-
ery in the Civil War, sacrificed to pre-
serve this Union, and then had their 
earned citizenship stripped away. Dec-
ades later, their grandsons fought in 
Europe even as their loved ones were 
interred in camps on American soil. 
And we march forward, and we march 
on, and we expand the right to the bal-
lot box. 
In 
the 
sixties, 
White 
Americans 
hopped on buses and risked their lives 
Freedom Riding through the South so 
those with darker skin could walk into 
the ballot box without fear of billy 
clubs. 
And Americans of all backgrounds 
have packed their rucks, laced up their 
boots, and gone to war in places like 
Iraq, lost their lives in places like Af-
ghanistan, to defend the most Amer-
ican belief: that we all have a voice and 
we all have the right to use it, includ-
ing at the polls, because voting to elect 
one’s own government is the core of 
that right. 
I am not asking anyone to do any-
thing nearly as difficult as putting on 
a uniform and going to war or crossing 
a bridge and being met with billy clubs. 
I am not asking anybody to do any-
thing that difficult today. I am not 
asking my Republican colleagues to 
risk their lives on a bus or a bridge, in 
the heat of the American South or 
under the scorching Sun of a desert in 
the Middle East. All I am asking for is 
the bare minimum. All I am begging 
them to do is merely to not sit in si-
lence in the face of grave injustice, to 
not let being partisan keep them from 
being a patriot. 
For the sake of all who have sac-
rificed for this Nation, I, at least, 
refuse to remain silent. That is why I 
am voting for these bills. That is why 
I am trying to claw back some of the 
protections 
that 
Republicans 
have 
spent the last year trying to erode on 
the back of the Big Lie, including ex-
panded voter purges, increased barriers 
for voters with disabilities, and harsher 
voter ID requirements. 
That is why I am asking my col-
leagues who claim to represent the 
party of Lincoln, as a junior Senator 
from the ‘‘Land of Lincoln,’’ I ask you 
to act in a way that will further the 
cause of justice. That is why I am 
working to restore the Voting Rights 
Act, to expand early voting and vote- 
by-mail, 
to 
limit 
special 
interest 
money in politics, and to actually try 
to protect underserved communities 
and our servicemembers’ rights to 
vote—because not only can our country 
do better, we have done better. Back 
when we passed the Voting Rights Act 
all those decades ago, not only can our 
Chamber do more, we have done more, 
including the 16 Republicans who are 
still in the Senate today who have pre-
viously voted to reauthorize the Voting 
Rights Act. 
And we owe more to those heroes who 
fought these fights before us, those 
trailblazers who marched those bridges 
while those in power broke their bones, 
whose skulls were cracked, whose blood 
was shed, yet whose will never bent, 
whose determination never wavered, 
those heroes who never let what was 
hard deter them from doing what was 
right. We owe it to each of them—and 
to those whose rights are at risk 
today—to pass this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Montana. 
ABORTION 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise 
today ahead of the 49th anniversary of 
the Supreme Court’s tragic decision in 
Roe v. Wade. You might ask: What does 
that have to do with voting rights? It 
has a lot to do with voting rights be-
cause, after all, you can’t have the 
right to vote without first having the 
right to life. 
Every year, for nearly five decades, 
thousands of pro-life Americans have 
faithfully gathered here in DC and 
across this country to mark this dark 
day by marching for life and being a 
voice for the voiceless. 
This year’s official March for Life 
comes at a turning point in our Na-
tion’s history. On December 1 of last 
year, the Supreme Court heard oral ar-
guments on the landmark 15-week 
abortion case out of Mississippi, Dobbs 
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion. 
This is the first case in our genera-
tion that presents the Supreme Court 
of the United States the best oppor-
tunity to right its historic injustice 
and finally overturn Roe v. Wade. 
The Roe decision has resulted in the 
deaths of more than 63 million inno-
cent babies—63 million. In fact, as I 
stand here and speak today, 2,363

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S324 
January 19, 2022 
preborn children are being killed in 
this country—2,363 are killed every sin-
gle day. 
These precious lives were created by 
God and intended for this world but 
were violently deprived of their lives 
because they were deemed unwanted, 
unfit, or simply inconvenient. And be-
cause they are so small, without voices 
of their own, far too many, for far too 
long, have ignored their desperate 
cries. Because of Roe, States have vir-
tually been powerless to stop this tidal 
wave of bloodshed. 
What is more, Roe’s extreme abor-
tion regime has made the United 
States a global outlier on abortion. We 
are just one of seven nations, including 
China and North Korea, that allow 
abortions on demand—just one of seven 
nations—past the point babies feel 
pain, all the way up until the moment 
of birth. It is barbaric. 
Because of science and technology 
today, it is impossible to ignore the hu-
manity of that little baby growing in 
the womb. Thanks to incredible 4D 
ultrasound technology, we can watch 
babies grow. We can hear their hearts 
beat. We can watch them yawn, even 
suck their thumbs. 
We have come a long way since 1973. 
It is time our laws catch up with the 
science. Overturning Roe will not—I re-
peat, will not—ban abortion nation-
wide. And I am sad to say that some of 
my colleagues are not being truthful 
on what it might mean if Roe v. Wade 
is overturned. It will not ban abortions 
nationwide. It will return the power to 
pass pro-life laws to State and Federal 
lawmakers. 
In fact, according to a recent Marist 
poll, 80 percent of Americans are op-
posed to abortions after the first 3 
months of pregnancy. That is an over-
whelming majority of the American 
people. But because of Roe, their voices 
are being silenced. It is time for the 
Supreme Court to allow State and Fed-
eral lawmakers to rightfully represent 
their constituents and protect the 
most vulnerable among us. 
It is time that we as the United 
States of America—a nation who is 
supposed to be the leaders in the world 
of human rights—recognize what hap-
pens to be the theme of this year’s 
March for Life, which is that equality 
begins in the womb. 
The Dobbs case before the Supreme 
Court gives the Court a chance to fi-
nally restore justice and equality of 
the most vulnerable among us, in the 
spirit of this Nation’s long history of 
progress in civil rights. 
In listening to oral arguments in the 
Dobbs case, I was struck by something 
Justice Kavanaugh said. 
If you think about some of the most impor-
tant cases, the most consequential cases in 
this court’s history, there’s a string of them 
where the cases overruled precedent. 
Justice Kavanaugh cited most nota-
bly Brown v. Board of Education in 
1954, which outlawed a separate but 
equal, overturning Plessy v. Ferguson 
decided in 1896. It took 58 years for the 
Court to recognize the obvious truth 
that racial segregation was wrong and 
overturn its grievous error in Plessy. 
Justice John Marshall Harlan showed 
tremendous courage as the lone dis-
senter from the Court decision in 
Plessy. 
Now, it has taken 49 years for the 
Court to consider the obvious truth 
that all life must be protected. It has 
taken 49 years since Roe v. Wade for 
the Court to reconsider this wrongly 
decided case. 
In the spirit of Justice Harlan, who 
dissented in Plessy, I would like to 
share a quote from another great dis-
senter proved right in the course of his-
tory, and that is Justice Byron White. 
Justice White, with his 1973 dissent, 
joined by Justice Rehnquist, in Doe v. 
Bolton, the companion case to Roe v. 
Wade wrote as follows: 
With all due respect, I dissent. I find noth-
ing in the language or history of the Con-
stitution to support the Court’s judgment. 
The Court simply fashions and announces a 
new constitutional right for pregnant moth-
ers and, with scarcely any reason or author-
ity for its action, invests that right in suffi-
cient substance to override most existing 
state abortion statutes. 
The upshot is that the people and the legis-
latures of the 50 States are constitutionally 
disentitled to weigh the relative importance 
of the continued existence and development 
of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spec-
trum of possible impacts on the mother, on 
the other hand. 
As an exercise of raw judicial power, the 
Court perhaps has authority to do what it 
does today; but, in my view, its judgment is 
an improvident and extravagant exercise of 
the power of judicial review that the Con-
stitution extends to this Court. 
The Court apparently values the conven-
ience of the pregnant mother more than the 
continued existence and development of the 
life or potential life that she carries. Wheth-
er or not I might agree with that marshaling 
of values, I can in no event join the Court’s 
judgment because I find no constitutional 
warrant for imposing such an order of prior-
ities on the people and legislatures of the 
States. In a sensitive area such as this, in-
volving as it does issues over which reason-
able men may easily and heatedly differ, I 
cannot accept the Court’s exercise of its 
clear power of choice by interposing a con-
stitutional barrier to state efforts to protect 
human life and by investing mothers and 
doctors with the constitutionally protected 
right to exterminate it. This issue, for the 
most part, should be left with the people and 
to the political processes the people have de-
vised to govern their affairs. 
Justice White was correct. I share 
that belief. The Court’s decision in Roe 
was a travesty of constitutional law 
and human rights, one that should fol-
low Plessy v. Ferguson to the ash heap 
of history. 
In the Dobbs case, I pray that we see 
the Supreme Court do precisely this: 
correct this historic injustice and up-
hold 
Mississippi’s 
15-week 
abortion 
law. 
For the pro-life movement, over-
turning Roe is not the end; it is just 
the beginning. States across the coun-
try stand ready to protect life and pro-
vide support for pregnant moms facing 
crisis pregnancies. 
I pray this year’s March for Life 
marks the final anniversary of Roe v. 
Wade and heralds the dawn of a new 
day, where every life is protected. 
I want to thank the thousands of 
Americans across the country who will 
be joining this year’s March for Life. I 
would also like to thank the hundreds 
of Montanans who joined me just last 
week in Helena for last week’s March 
for Life. I stand with you, and we will 
continue to fight to protect all life. 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. President, last year we saw 
Democrats like Stacey Abrams and 
President Biden mislead the American 
people about Georgia’s new voting law. 
In fact, the Washington Post fact 
checker wrote: 
Biden falsely claims the new Georgia law 
ends voting hours early. 
That was given four Pinocchios by 
the Washington Post. 
However, today, in this Chamber, we 
have seen several Senate Democrats 
challenge 
Montana’s 
commonsense 
election integrity laws championed by 
the Montana Legislature; the secretary 
of state of Montana, Christi Jacobsen; 
and 
the 
Montana 
Governor, 
Greg 
Gianforte. 
I want to set the record straight. 
Montana put in place some common-
sense reforms that enjoy the strong 
support of Montanans, like strength-
ening voter ID laws and preventing 
paid ballot harvesting. 
There have been some things said 
here on the floor that are, frankly, not 
true. Ballot harvesting is still OK in 
Montana; you just can’t pay people to 
do it. 
In fact, there were statements made 
that somehow student IDs are not al-
lowed anymore to vote, that somehow 
that is going to be the end of democ-
racy. Well, listen, under current law— 
first of all, most students have a valid 
driver’s license in Montana, but if you 
didn’t, the requirement is this—and I 
take this chapter and verse off of the 
secretary of state’s site—you can still 
use a student ID to vote in Montana; 
you just have to have a secondary iden-
tification. That can be a ski pass, a 
gym membership, so long as both iden-
tification types are presented. 
First of all, most students have valid 
driver’s licenses. If you don’t, you can 
still use a student ID. You just have to 
have a secondary identification type 
presented, like a ski pass, gym mem-
bership, or even a transcript. That does 
not seem unreasonable, and the vast 
majority of Montanans believe that 
just makes sense. 
Furthermore, we have seen ques-
tions—in fact, Senator SCHUMER made 
some accusation about Montana short-
ening the hours for elections. I found 
that a bit hilarious, frankly, because 
here is what we did in Montana. All 
voter registration activities are al-
lowed now up until the night before the 
election. Up until the day of the elec-
tion, you are allowed to register to 
vote, unlike New York, which ends 
voter registration 25 days before the

election. I don’t think that is going to 
be the end of democracy when Montana 
has far easier, far better laws here to 
make it easier to vote in Montana than 
they do in New York. 
In fact, regarding New York, the vot-
ers last November rejected same-day 
voter registration and rejected uni-
versal absentee voting. States across 
this country have been working hard to 
ensure that we are making it easier to 
vote but making it more difficult to 
cheat. 
I am grateful for what has been hap-
pening in the State of Montana. It is a 
no-brainer to most Montanans that 
you need a valid ID, a driver’s license, 
to get a hunting or fishing license, to 
rent a car, to get onto an airplane, not 
to mention the fact that in many lib-
eral-run cities now across our country, 
the Democrats are now enforcing ID 
checks to get into a coffee shop or sit 
down for dinner. 
So it is no wonder we are left a little 
confused here by how President Biden, 
CHUCK SCHUMER, and Senate Democrats 
want to override the will of Montanans 
and undermine our State voter ID laws 
when it comes to maintaining some-
thing as foundational as our democracy 
and maintaining integrity in our elec-
tions. 
If there is one thing Montanans are 
about, 
it 
is 
common 
sense. 
The 
fearmongering, the falsehoods, and the 
misleading statements from the Demo-
crats don’t make a whole lot of sense, 
and Montanans know it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. I wasn’t going to 
speak, but I have to speak because I 
wanted to clear up the record on one 
thing. 
The people in the State of Montana 
voted for same-day registration. The 
people of the State of Montana went to 
the ballot box and voted for same-day 
registration. The State legislature re-
pealed that. We should ask what the 
people of Montana really want. They 
want same-day registration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. President, I want to 
start by thanking all the Senators who 
have come to the floor to make the 
case for democracy and for voting 
rights. The right to vote is the heart-
beat of our democracy. It is a symbol 
of the progress that we have made in 
this Chamber and the promise that we 
have made to the next generation of 
Americans. 
This legislation will protect the right 
to vote for all, safeguard against elec-
tion sabotage, end partisan gerry-
mandering, and limit the influence of 
dark money in politics so that billion-
aires and corporations cannot buy elec-
tions. Protecting our democracy should 
not be partisan; it should be a moral 
and civic imperative for every one of 
us. 
As a former U.S. Senator from New 
Mexico, the late Dennis Chavez, who 
served in this Chamber for 27 years 
until his passing in 1962, said: 
Either we are all free, or we fail; democ-
racy belongs to all of us. 
Our 
democracy 
faces 
clear 
and 
present dangers posed by Republican- 
led State legislatures across the coun-
try. Some lawmakers want to curtail 
the right to vote—not for all Ameri-
cans but for the most vulnerable and 
historically disenfranchised. And if we 
think it is bad now with what has hap-
pened in these State legislatures over 
these last few months, it is about to 
get a lot worse. 
History will not look kindly on inac-
tion at this critical moment, and we 
must show the American people that 
we will not flinch when faced with a 
choice to protect our democracy and 
let it crumble before our eyes. 
There is a pattern of rampant dis-
crimination that is disenfranchising 
countless Black and Brown voters 
across this country. 
In 2005, Jesus Gonzalez became a nat-
uralized citizen. On the same day he 
swore an oath to the United States, he 
sought to register to vote in Arizona. 
He was rejected, so he tried again after 
he obtained a license, but again he was 
rejected. It was then that Mr. Gon-
zalez, a school janitor, sued the State. 
His case made its way to the Supreme 
Court, which in 2013 ruled in his favor 
and struck down Arizona’s law. Mr. 
Gonzalez was 1 of 31,000 voters in Ari-
zona affected by such a discriminatory 
law. 
Just this past September, the Mexi-
can-American 
Legal 
Defense 
Fund 
joined other civil rights organizations 
in suing Texas over its discriminatory 
voting legislation known as S.B. 1. We 
have heard a lot about it today. Among 
other things, S.B. 1 seeks to curb the 
assistance available to limited English- 
proficient voters. 
In 2006, MALDEF successfully sued 
Texas 
after 
the 
State 
legislature 
sought to dilute the Latino vote. In 
that case, LULAC v. Perry, the Su-
preme Court found that Texas violated 
the Voting Rights Act by denying 
Latinos the ability to elect a candidate 
of their choosing. 
In 2017, MALDEF again sued Texas 
after the city of Pasadena sought to 
weaken the Latino vote by changing 
the way the city elected city council 
members. 
These are just some of the chapters 
of a long history of voter suppression. 
We also know that voter suppression 
of Native Americans is real, and it is 
intentional. 
Until 2020, North Dakota voter ID 
laws required a residential street ad-
dress. Now, that may sound like com-
mon sense to some folks, but for those 
of us who live in rural communities 
and for my brothers and sisters who 
live in Native American communities, 
we all grew up with rural route boxes. 
My address growing up was Route 1, 
Box 102, not because I didn’t want a 
street address named after my grand-
parents like it is today; that was the 
address. 
Because of that law in North Dakota, 
many Native Americans, like Richard 
Brakebill, who is a Navy veteran, have 
been denied the right to vote because 
of an expired driver’s license and a 
Tribal ID that—get this—did not have 
a current residential address. It had 
the post office box that was his ad-
dress. 
In 2020, the candidacy of Joseph 
Dedman for county sheriff—a member 
of the Navajo Nation—was challenged 
in Arizona because he included post of-
fice boxes, which are often the only 
form of address for rural Native Amer-
ican households—it is the only one 
they can obtain—on his petition for of-
fice. 
In 2020, Arizona’s Pima County closed 
the early voting center on Pascua 
Yaqui lands and spent nearly $200,000 in 
legal fees rather than reinstate the 
voting center. 
South Dakota provided a fully funded 
polling place and early voting and reg-
istration opportunities to the 12 non- 
Native American residents in Gann 
Valley, but—get this—they refused to 
provide the same services to the 1,200- 
plus residents in Fort Thompson on 
Crow Creek Tribal lands. 
In 2021, Kimberly Dillon, a citizen of 
Rosebud Sioux Tribe, joined the Oglala 
and Rosebud Sioux Tribes in suing 
South Dakota for requiring voters to 
register at State agencies and DMVs, 
which were hours away from Tribal 
lands. They were making it harder for 
people to register to vote by saying: 
Drive 3 or 4 hours away. Those are 
tough roads to drive on. 
Many Native Americans like Kim-
berly went to great lengths to submit 
their voter registration applications to 
those State agencies, but the agencies 
never sent them to the local election 
offices even after they traversed and 
got the job done in making that jour-
ney. They just want to submit them to 
let them get registered to vote. As a re-
sult, her right to vote in the 2020 Presi-
dential election was taken away. 
Kimberly asked: 
How many other people faced this viola-
tion of our basic freedom to vote? We cannot 
allow voter suppression to continue in South 
Dakota or anywhere in Native America. 
These are American citizens whose 
rights were taken away from them for 
partisan 
advantage. 
Jesus 
and 
Kimberly’s voices were taken away 
from them just like countless other 
Americans who face the same discrimi-
nation. 
Nineteen States have passed 34 laws 
making it easier to sabotage election 
laws and target voters of color, and not 
all of them had a supermajority of two- 
thirds vote. 
In 2016, Representative David Lewis, 
a Republican State lawmaker in North 
Carolina and member of the general as-
sembly’s redistricting committee, said: 
I propose that we draw the maps to give a 
partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and 
three Democrats [representatives] . . . be-
cause I do not believe it’s possible to draw a 
map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.

S326 
January 19, 2022 
This is not new. This has been going 
on decade after decade. The only thing 
that is different now is that in 2013, 
when the Supreme Court gutted the en-
forcement provisions of the Voting 
Rights Act, Republican-led legislatures 
don’t have to hide behind it any longer. 
Now they just say they are going to 
draw for partisan advantage. They are 
going to change the rules to keep cer-
tain communities from voting, making 
it harder for people to get to that bal-
lot box. 
This is nothing new, and shame on 
all of us for not acting when the Su-
preme Court told us this in 2013. That 
is on all of us. But we are here today. 
We are also seeing an uptick in vio-
lence as a result of the lies across the 
country—the Big Lie. The Department 
of Homeland Security has seen an in-
crease in calls for violence as a result 
of these baseless claims of fraud in the 
2020 election. We are losing honest 
election officials and poll workers be-
cause of threats against their lives due 
to conspiracy theories and lies pushed 
by the former President. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act will protect the vote of working 
families across the country. Only one 
archaic parliamentary measure pro-
hibits all this progress. 
The filibuster does not increase de-
liberation in this Chamber. It does not 
incentivize compromise. So while some 
claim that amending the filibuster will 
further the country’s division, I dis-
agree. Right now, it is only aiding and 
abetting obstructionists and opponents 
of progress when it comes to voting on 
civil rights legislation. 
While the filibuster is not mentioned 
a single time in the Constitution— 
Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague 
stop for a brief interruption? 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the cloture vote on the mo-
tion to concur be at 8 p.m. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you. 
I appreciate the courtesy of my col-
league. We had no choice but to do it at 
6:30. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. So the importance of us 
being here today goes right in the face 
of having this conversation as a debate. 
I appreciate my Republican colleagues 
who have come to the floor to engage 
in some debate, in some colloquy. 
I, like Senator KAINE, came to the 
Senate a bit naive. I thought debate 
happened here all the time. I came here 
thinking that I could offer an amend-
ment at any time, that I could offer a 
unanimous consent at any time. That 
is not the case. This is not the Senate 
that our Founders envisioned. 
Now, if you feel moved to oppose a 
piece of legislation, if you are pas-
sionate about an issue, you should have 
the courage to come to the Senate 
floor in front of your colleagues and 
the American people. 
You should not be allowed to vote it 
in from behind closed doors. This 
Chamber has changed, just as the times 
have changed. So it is the responsi-
bility of every one of us to make sure 
that the Senate works better, not for 
us but for the American people. 
Now, in closing, in 1805, Vice Presi-
dent Aaron Burr suggested that the 
Senate remove from its rules the ‘‘pre-
vious question motion,’’ which allowed 
the Chamber’s simple majority to end 
debate on a bill. He viewed the rule as 
completely unnecessary and urged the 
Senate to clean up its rule book be-
cause after everyone had spoken and 
debated, they would vote. 
A year later, the Senate removed the 
previous question motion, leaving a 
loophole that allowed the minority to 
take advantage and use what we now 
know as the filibuster. Unfortunately, 
Burr could not foresee the obstruc-
tionism of decades to come. 
In the following decades, pro-slavery 
Senators co-opted the filibuster to pro-
tect the interests of White southern en-
slavers. Men such as John Calhoun 
abused the filibuster to obstruct civil 
right efforts. 
And according to historians, between 
1917 and 1994, 30 measures favored by 
the sitting President and simple ma-
jorities in the House and Senate—half 
of which addressed civil rights—they 
all died, thanks to the filibuster. 
The same procedural tool proved to 
be even more useful to southern Sen-
ators who sought to block civil rights 
legislation, 
including 
antilynching 
bills. Not until 1964 did the Senate suc-
cessfully overcome a filibuster to pass 
important civil rights legislation and 
subsequent voting rights legislation. 
Now, history should act as a teacher 
to all of us, and history will remind us 
who voted today on the side of the peo-
ple. I am proud that this effort includes 
my Native American Voting Rights 
Act, which will ensure Tribes and Na-
tive Americans and Alaskan Natives 
and voters on Tribal lands will have 
equal access to the electoral process. 
Access to the ballot box is the corner-
stone of our democratic system, and 
without equitable access to it, we can-
not stand on the world stage and claim 
that we are all leaders in the fight for 
liberty and justice for all. 
Now, my Republican colleagues have 
proven time and again that they are 
not interested in acting on this issue. 
Washington Republicans have made the 
political calculation that they have a 
partisan advantage here. They are too 
comfortable shrugging their shoulders 
and sitting on the sidelines while 
States chip away at the right to vote. 
I know where I stand. All we are ask-
ing for today is the opportunity to vote 
on this critical piece of legislation 
after everyone here has said their 
piece. 
I urge my colleagues to do the right 
thing today, to do right by our democ-
racy, and to send the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act to the President’s 
desk. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Our democracy is ex-
traordinary because it is built on the 
bedrock idea that, through free and 
fair elections, the citizens who make 
up this great country, well, they have a 
voice, that each person’s vote truly 
matters, and in America the people 
have the power. 
But at this moment, our democracy 
is threatened. Republican State legis-
latures and Governors all over the 
country are writing laws designed to 
restrict the right to vote, to make it 
harder for tens of millions of eligible 
citizens to cast their ballots, and si-
lence the American people’s voice in 
the process. 
Make no mistake, this is an unprece-
dented, coordinated attack to make 
voting harder for eligible citizens and 
make it easier for bad actors to sabo-
tage our future elections. 
In my State of Nevada, we have 
bucked that trend when it comes to 
voting rights. We have strengthened 
the right to vote, providing easier ac-
cess to the ballot box for eligible vot-
ers while ensuring fair elections. 
These measures that Governor Steve 
Sisolak signed into law include estab-
lishing a permanent vote-by-mail sys-
tem, expanding the early voting period, 
and making it more convenient to reg-
ister and to vote. But while Nevada has 
moved forward to protect and strength-
en voting rights, we are not immune 
from the attempts to sabotage it. 
In Nevada, the leading Republican 
candidate for our secretary of state 
stated that he would have refused—I 
repeat, would have refused—to certify 
President Biden’s victory in our State, 
even though the results were certified 
by a Republican secretary of state and 
unanimously upheld by the Nevada Su-
preme Court. That same candidate 
opened the door to certifying alter-
nate—alternate—electors 
in 
future 
Presidential elections in Nevada, con-
trary to the actual election results. 
And in Nevada, the leading Repub-
lican 
candidates 
for 
Governor 
are 
promising to undo our progress and 
make it harder for Nevadans to vote 
because they refused to accept the re-
sults of the 2020 election. 
They are pushing the former Presi-
dent’s false conspiracy theories that 
fueled the January 6 insurrection. At-
tacks like these are a growing threat 
to democracy and exactly—exactly— 
the reason we need to act urgently. If 
we fail to do so—if we fail to do so here 
and now—new State laws will result in 
hours-long lines at the polls, over-
turned election results, and masses of 
disenfranchised voters. 
So let’s talk about solutions—smart 
solutions, solutions that give every eli-
gible voter equal access to the ballot 
box. 
The Freedom to Vote Act combined 
with the John Lewis Voting Right Ad-
vancement Act meets this moment. It 
meets the moment we are in with our

January 19, 2022 
democracy in crisis. It delivers real, 
meaningful action. 
First, this bill makes it easy for peo-
ple to register to vote. It does this by 
requiring 
States 
to 
allow 
eligible 
Americans to register online and on 
election day, as well as update our 
automatic voter registration system. 
This bill would also require States to 
accurately maintain their voter reg-
istration 
list 
and 
protect 
voters 
against unwarranted purges from the 
voter rolls. This way, those who should 
be eligible to vote can do so without 
hassle or harassment. 
The Freedom to Vote Act gives 
Americans more choices on when and 
how they can legally vote through na-
tional standards for early in-person 
voting, expanded mail-in voting, and fi-
nally, making election day a national 
holiday, because even if you are a hard- 
working American who is busy working 
long hours or looking after your chil-
dren or caring for a sick relative, you 
should still have access to the ballot 
box. 
This bill would ensure election secu-
rity and prevent partisan sabotage by 
requiring postelection audits and en-
hancing—enhancing—protections 
for 
election records. 
The Freedom to Vote Act would also 
take long-needed steps to end political 
corruption in our elections. It would 
accomplish this by protecting U.S. 
elections from foreign interference, by 
prohibiting false information designed 
to dissuade eligible voters, by pro-
moting online ad transparency, and by 
putting an end—an end—to that dark 
money in our elections. 
To borrow a few words from the late 
Congressman John Lewis, my former 
colleague from the House, a legendary 
civil rights leader and American hero 
for whom this bill is named, an inspira-
tion to us all and to people all around 
the world, John Lewis said: ‘‘The right 
to vote is the most powerful . . . tool 
. . . in a democracy.’’ 
I’m going to repeat those words from 
John Lewis. Listen closely: ‘‘The right 
to vote is the most powerful . . . tool 
. . . in a democracy.’’ 
Each person’s vote is their voice. It is 
every citizen’s opportunity to weigh in 
on what matters most to them, for 
their family, for their community, for 
the country, for the world. It matters. 
It is fundamental to our democracy, to 
the very definition of what it means to 
be an American citizen for each and 
every one of us to stand up, to stand 
tall, to get to the ballot box, to be able 
to vote the way we choose and have the 
assurance that our vote is counted. It 
matters. Each person matters. 
And so if the Senate cannot move 
forward on this critically important 
legislation under the status quo, then 
it is time to reform the rules, to re-
store the Senate, to pass this legisla-
tion—because only then can we protect 
our democracy’s future and secure the 
freedom to vote for every eligible 
American, for this generation and for 
the generations to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose the 
Democrats’ Federal election takeover. 
The President just gave one of his rare 
press conferences. It was only the sec-
ond one he actually gave on American 
soil. 
The White House seems to think that 
the cure for Joe Biden’s poll numbers is 
more communications from Joe Biden. 
And the press conference went on for 1 
hour and 54 minutes. 
The White House doesn’t have a com-
munications problem. It has an agenda 
problem. The American people under-
stand exactly what President Biden 
and Senator SCHUMER
and Speaker 
PELOSI are trying to sell. The Amer-
ican people aren’t buying it. 
Democrats don’t need a message 
reset. They need a better agenda for 
the Nation. What we are about to vote 
on tonight has nothing to do with the 
priorities of the American people. It 
has nothing to do with coronavirus. It 
has nothing to do with 40-year high in-
flation numbers which are biting into 
the paychecks of the American people. 
It has nothing to do with the crisis at 
the southern border, where 2 million il-
legal immigrants have crossed the bor-
der this year—criminals among them, 
drug smugglers among them, gang 
members among them. It has nothing 
to do with what has driven the Presi-
dent’s approval numbers to an all-time 
low of 40 percent, which it is today in 
the Gallup poll. 
The Democrats’ No. 1 goal, which 
they stated at the beginning of the 
Congress, is to pass a Federal takeover 
of elections. An election takeover bill 
was the first bill they introduced. 
Democrats are ignoring what the 
American people are demanding so that 
they can do what their radical fringe is 
demanding. Democrats want elections 
to be run by Washington, DC, instead 
of the 50 States. 
The Constitution is very clear. It 
says the States run our elections. Well, 
why do they want to take over our 
elections? 
Well, Democrats want to do things 
like banning voter ID laws. Now 80 per-
cent 
of 
Americans 
believe 
people 
should have to show a photo ID in 
order to vote. 
Senator SCHUMER has already twice 
tried to cram an election takeover bill 
down the throats of the American pub-
lic. This is the third time. And, so far, 
he has failed. 
So why? Why has this continued to 
fail? Not simply because Republicans 
oppose it. It has failed because the 
American people oppose it. 
The American people aren’t looking 
for a Federal Government takeover of 
elections. A recent Gallup poll asked 
people what they think is the most im-
portant issue facing our country. Vot-
ing laws didn’t crack the top 20. In 
fact, voting laws received less than 1 
percent of the vote. It was an asterisk 
in the results. 
Democrats’ scare tactics on voting 
laws have utterly failed. Now Demo-
crats are so desperate to change our 
voting laws to their advantage that 
they are going to try to break the Sen-
ate. That is what they are doing now. 
The Senate is supposed to be ‘‘the 
world’s greatest deliberative body.’’ 
Some Democrats want deliberations to 
end forever. 
Democrats claim they will change 
our election laws and then they will 
stop; one time only; claim they will 
only rig the game just once. Well, we 
all know that is not true. If they can’t 
resist the temptation to rig the U.S. 
Senate once, they won’t resist the 
temptation to rig the rest of the gov-
ernment either. 
Once Democrats change the rules, 
there will be no stopping them from 
doing 
everything 
they 
have 
ever 
dreamed: pack the Supreme Court, add 
new States to the Union, amnesty for 
illegal immigrants, try to take away 
rights 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
Second 
Amendment—you name it. If they can 
do it, sooner or later, they will. 
There is a bill in the Senate right 
now to add four new Justices to the Su-
preme Court. Forty-six Democrats in 
the Senate have signed on to a bill for 
statehood for the District of Columbia. 
It is almost the entire Democrat cau-
cus. Democrats have also introduced a 
bill to give statehood to Puerto Rico. If 
these bills become law, Democrats 
know they will get four more Democrat 
Senators permanently. 
One change to the Senate rules, and 
America would have a permanent one- 
party rule. Don’t take my word for it 
on amnesty either. Just months ago, 
Democrats tried to pass amnesty for 6.5 
million illegal immigrants. That is 
greater than the population of 32 of our 
50 States. Amnesty of this magnitude 
would permanently remake our elec-
torate. New York City has already 
granted the right to vote to illegal im-
migrants. If Democrats break the rules 
of the Senate in order to change the 
rules, they will pass amnesty as fast as 
they can. 
Over the past year, they have gone on 
record. They have sponsored the bills. 
Yet they know they have failed to per-
suade the American public to support 
this agenda. They know they will never 
have bipartisan support to pass the 
radical amnesty for illegal immigrants; 
never have bipartisan support to ban 
voter identification; never have bipar-
tisan support for taxes and punishing 
regulations that continue to drive up 
the cost of energy; never persuade the 
American people to support their rad-
ical, extreme, dangerous, and scary 
agenda. Yet, rather than change the 
agenda to comply with what the Amer-
ican people want, the Democrats want 
to change the rules. So, desperate for 
this radical agenda, they are willing to 
destroy the Senate. 
Democrats have a long list of par-
tisan bills they would like to pass. All

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S328 
January 19, 2022 
of these bills have two things in com-
mon: They have nothing to do with im-
proving the lives of the American peo-
ple, as the American people see it 
today, and they give more power to the 
Democrat politicians in Washington, 
DC. 
Let me remind my colleagues that 
there is an election in November. In 
the last election cycle, seven Demo-
crats ran for President saying they 
would change the rules of the Senate. 
They all lost. Democrats who said they 
would change the rules lost key Senate 
races in swing States, including Mon-
tana, Maine, and Kentucky. 
The American people have spoken 
loud and clear. They don’t want to see 
this Democrat power grab. American 
people want us to focus on their prior-
ities. It is up to them to tell us what is 
important to them, and what we are 
hearing loud and clear from the Amer-
ican public, it is coronavirus, it is in-
flation, it is national security, it is 
crime, and it is securing the border— 
not a bigger power grab for politicians. 
The Democrats in this body seem to 
have forgotten the people they were 
elected to serve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President and col-
leagues, as today’s debate begins to 
wind down, I want to rise to join those 
who have called for the passage of the 
Freedom to Vote Act and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Years ago, when the United States 
was in the early stages of conflict in 
Vietnam, I was fortunate to win a Navy 
ROTC 
scholarship 
to 
attend 
Ohio 
State. 
During my freshman year there, as 
spring break approached, our com-
manding officer urged a bunch of us 
freshman midshipmen to—he said: I got 
a deal for you. How would you like an 
all-expenses-paid trip to Quantico, VA, 
over spring break? 
That is where the marine officers 
trained after going to college. 
We all raised our hands and said: 
Count us in. 
On our way—1 day off—we had 5 days 
in Quantico and 1 day off. We took a 
train to Union Station in Washington, 
DC, just three or four blocks from here, 
and from there, most of my fellow mid-
shipmen found their way to watering 
holes in Georgetown. I chose to visit 
Capitol Hill. It is a place I had never 
been. 
That day, I walked up Delaware Ave-
nue and passed this building, somehow 
finding my way into the Rayburn 
House Office Building just a short dis-
tance from where we are gathered 
today. I walked up to a security officer 
there and asked if there were any hear-
ings underway that I might try to sit 
in on. He said yep, and he directed me 
to a long line leading to the House Ju-
diciary Committee room. 
After a long wait, I finally had the 
chance to find a seat and watch in per-
son the debate over what would later 
become the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I 
was glued to that seat for hours, mes-
merized by what I saw and what I 
heard. 
Later, back on the train to Quantico 
that evening, my friends asked me 
what I had found on Capitol Hill on 
that day, and I told them I thought I 
may have found my future. As it 
turned out, I did. 
That day and in the days to come, 
those hearings inspired by the civil 
rights movement forced a spotlight on 
the discriminatory State laws that had 
made it nearly impossible for many 
Black Americans to vote 100 years 
after the end of the Civil War. 
Years earlier, my sister and I had 
grown up in Danville, VA, the last cap-
ital of the Confederacy. There, we saw 
racial discrimination up close and per-
sonal. Even as children, we knew it was 
wrong, and we knew it had to change. 
Sitting in Rayburn years later, I 
found the place where I thought just 
maybe—just maybe—I might be able to 
help do something to right that wrong. 
Nearly 18 years later, since sitting in 
that hearing room, after I had finished 
my studies and completed my third de-
ployment to Southeast Asia as a naval 
flight officer during the Vietnam war, I 
found myself back on Capitol Hill in 
these halls, this time serving alongside 
John Lewis in the House of Representa-
tives. 
After years of blatant discrimination 
and voter suppression specifically tar-
geted at Black Americans, we began to 
witness change. It came slowly at first 
and then more quickly. 
Thanks to the tireless efforts of peo-
ple like our friend John Lewis, the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 gained increas-
ingly popular bipartisan support over 
the years. In fact, as we heard earlier, 
by 2006, the vote to extend the Voting 
Rights Act was unanimous. Imagine 
that—98 to 0. Think about it—98 to 0. 
Today, 16 of the Republican colleagues 
who voted for it among those 98 are 
still here—are still here. 
Given that history, however, it is al-
most unbelievable to think that the 
right to vote is under attack once 
again in many parts of our country. 
Today, in States across America, State 
legislators and some Governors are 
seeking to enact a wave of voter re-
strictions, many of them with the sole 
purpose of making it harder to vote, 
often 
specifically 
targeting 
Black 
Americans. 
In 2021 alone, 19 States passed some 
34 laws restricting the right to vote. 
How? Well, by allowing partisan ob-
servers to intimidate independent poll 
workers in Texas and by pulling drop 
boxes and ballot applications out of the 
hands of voters and imposing penalties 
for poll workers in Florida who were 
just trying to do their jobs. In Georgia, 
it is OK to make the poll lines longer 
and longer, but you can’t bring food or 
water to the voters who wait in them, 
sometimes for hours, to vote—hours. 
We know that in many parts of 
America, Black voters have to wait in 
line for twice as long as White voters 
to cast their ballots—twice as long— 
and in some places, for up to 6 hours. 
That is not just morally wrong, it is an 
assault on who we are as a people. How 
can we look at what is happening and 
not ask, for God’s sake, can’t we do 
better than this? Indeed, we must. 
Let me leave you with one idea that 
worked in 1965 and just might work 
again in 2022. You know, every day 
across our country, Americans gather 
in places of worship. Every major reli-
gion in the world relies on one common 
principle that bolsters our connection 
to each other: the Golden Rule; the 
idea that we should love our neighbor 
as ourselves; the idea that we ought to 
treat people the way we want to be 
treated. 
Most Americans would be surprised 
to learn that that admonition is re-
peated almost weekly in multiple Bible 
studies and prayer breakfasts that are 
regularly held here on Capitol Hill 
throughout the year. It is a shared be-
lief across religious, ethnic, and party 
lines that the person across from us is 
just as valuable as us, just as deserving 
of love and dedication as we are and 
our loved ones are. 
In 1965, the Golden Rule was a 
foundational principle for equality in 
the Voting Rights Act. Congress was 
guided by it. In fact, every major reli-
gion on this planet embraces it. I don’t 
care if you are a Protestant, Catholic, 
Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and it 
goes on, the Golden Rule is in your 
teachings, in your beliefs. 
You hear it here in this body, in this 
building, week in and week out. Maybe, 
just maybe, it is about time for us to 
rely on it once again in this land of the 
free as we seek to connect our values 
and our faith to our actions. 
Most of us will recall that both Dr. 
King and the preamble of our Constitu-
tion called on us to work to make this 
a more perfect Union and fulfill the 
promise of our Founders that all men 
and women are created equal. 
While across our country today, we 
are seeing a growing wave of voter re-
strictions, I am reminded of what Mar-
tin Luther King said many years ago. 
He said this: 
Only when it is dark enough can we see the 
stars. 
Think about it. Only when it is dark 
enough can we see the stars. And some-
times it is only when we are tested as 
a nation that our true spirit shows 
itself. I pray—I pray—that this is just 
one such time. 
So while none of us hoped we would 
ever face these challenges in our de-
mocracy to our democracy in the year 
2022, perhaps we can take some comfort 
in knowing that someone else has 
walked this path before us. 
All these years later, we feel that 
‘‘fierce urgency of now,’’ that ‘‘fierce 
urgency of now’’ that Dr. King spoke of 
five decades before, providing us with 
both a moral blueprint and the encour-
agement to do something with it. 
As I close, let me just say, having 
said all that, let me reiterate that this

is not a time to wait and dawdle. Con-
gress needs to regroup when we leave 
this building this day, this week, and 
then act with the same sense of ur-
gency as an earlier Congress did in 1965 
and pass the Freedom to Vote Act and 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act in order to better pro-
tect the sacred right to vote and up-
hold the sanctity of our electoral proc-
esses. The legislation before us today 
seeks to make clear what we as a na-
tion aspire to be. It makes clear that 
no one who is eligible should be denied 
the sacred right to vote. 
Let me close, colleagues, by observ-
ing that in the end, we can quote Dr. 
King and praise my friend John Lewis 
until the cows come home, but when 
Americans’ sacred right to vote is on 
the line, it is our responsibility to up-
hold our oath to the Constitution and 
get on with it. 
I never knew Dr. King. I knew John 
Lewis, knew him well, and loved him. 
But I don’t know if Dr. King or John 
Lewis were fans of Mark Twain. I am. 
I want to close by paraphrasing the 
words of Mark Twain, and this is that 
paraphrase: When in doubt, do what is 
right. You will amaze your friends and 
confound your enemies. 
Well, friends, time has come to do 
just that, to do both of those things, 
and that is why no barrier should stand 
in the way of our sacred obligation to 
protect this democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
(The PRESIDENT pro tempore as-
sumed the Chair.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, the cur-
rent voting rights proposals or so- 
called voting rights proposals that the 
Democrats are proposing are not about 
increasing access to the ballot box. Ac-
cording to the Washington Post, the 
2020 election saw the highest voter 
turnout in 120 years, and 94 percent of 
the voters said that voting was easy. 
These bills are really a power grab that 
would circumvent and federalize our 
entire 
elections 
process, 
stripping 
States of their constitutional authori-
ties. 
These power grabs would force tax-
payers to pay for political campaigns, 
expand the practice of ballot har-
vesting, prohibit important voter ID 
laws, keep deceased people and those 
who have moved out of the area on 
voter registration rolls, and federalize 
election laws, which would violate the 
U.S. Constitution’s clear directive that 
States administer the elections, to 
name just a few. 
Article I, section 4 of the U.S. Con-
stitution delegates the election proc-
esses to the States. This is a Union of 
50 States. States are the best equipped 
to implement and enforce election poli-
cies that protect the integrity of all fu-
ture elections. 
Although many who have spoken 
today would have you believe that 
States across this Nation are seeking 
to violate the rights of American citi-
zens and restrict their access to voting, 
the laws that are being proposed and 
adopted by the States are doing just 
the opposite. They are helping to ex-
pand voter access and improve security 
at the polls. 
There 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
myths 
and 
untruths running rampant because the 
Democrats seem to want the public to 
think there is this widespread voter 
suppression in Republican-led States, 
which there is not. 
A couple of myths and the facts: 
Myth: Republican State legislatures 
are enacting laws that will roll back 
early voting. 
The fact is that the States are ex-
panding early voting. Georgia’s bill, for 
example, which has been attacked, al-
lows for and provides for—mandates 17 
days of early voting with two addi-
tional optional Sundays of early vot-
ing. The list goes on. Arizona allows 26 
days. Iowa allows 20 days. Texas, an-
other State that has been attacked, al-
lows 17 days. The fact is the States are 
expanding early voting. 
Myth: States are implementing voter 
ID for vote-by-mail in order to dis-
enfranchise voters. 
The fact: As vote-by-mail is increas-
ing in the States, the States are imple-
menting some of the same safeguards— 
the same safeguards—that are used for 
in-person voting to ensure a secure 
election, such as voter ID, which the 
legislation before us seems to want to 
prohibit. Recent polls show that 80 per-
cent of the people support being re-
quired to show ID in order to vote, in-
cluding 62 percent of Democrats. 
Myth: Prohibiting ballot harvesting 
and requiring people to vote in their 
own correct precinct constitutes dis-
crimination outlawed by the Voting 
Rights Act. 
Fact: In a recent Supreme Court 
case, the Court ruled 6 to 3 against this 
claim. Arizona law mandates that vot-
ers must vote in their assigned pre-
cinct, and those who vote early by mail 
cannot have anyone other than a 
household member, a family member, a 
caregiver, a postal worker, or an elec-
tions official collect their ballot; in 
other words, supervised ballot collec-
tion. This law effectively bans the 
practice of ballot harvesting. 
The Democrats seem to want to ex-
pand, even mandate, ballot harvesting 
in the legislation we are being asked to 
support tonight. 
Myth: States are improperly purging 
eligible voters from their voter rolls. 
Fact: States are taking reasonable 
measures to ensure their voter rolls are 
accurate, which makes elections more 
efficient and fair. States are simply 
implementing a time-honored practice 
of cleaning up voter lists, removing 
voters who have died or who have 
moved or who have been declared in-
competent by a court or convicted of a 
felony, a time-honored practice in 
many of the States across this Nation. 
Myth: Recent changes in Georgia to 
prevent people from giving bottles of 
water is inhumane and targets minor-
ity communities. 
Fact: The law allows poll workers to 
set up self-serve water stations for vot-
ers to use. The statute prevents polit-
ical organizations—political organiza-
tions—from giving people in line things 
like meals, water, or gifts. Once again, 
this is a longtime honored practice in 
States. This law of anti-electioneering 
or anti-vote-buying is standard prac-
tice in many States, including many of 
my colleagues’ blue States like New 
York, 
New 
Jersey, 
and 
President 
Biden’s home State of Delaware. 
So let’s get on to the filibuster. The 
argument is, since the Republicans 
won’t accept these long, directed, so- 
called reforms of our election laws, 
that we should eliminate the filibuster 
in the Senate. That is the last thing 
that should be done in the Senate. 
President Biden himself has argued 
against eliminating the filibuster, and 
according to a recent report, Demo-
crats used that filibuster over 300 times 
in 2020. 
In 2005, then-Senator Joe Biden gave 
a passionate floor speech defending the 
Senate filibuster, saying that this is a 
key procedural tool and ending it 
would ‘‘eviscerate the Senate’’ and do a 
‘‘disservice to the country’’ and would 
‘‘upset the constitutional design.’’ 
In another floor speech, then-Senator 
Biden further argued the reason Repub-
licans in Congress were attempting to 
end the filibuster was because they 
controlled ‘‘every level of govern-
ment.’’ He went on to point out that 
the reason to have the filibuster rule 
was so that ‘‘when one party controls 
all levers of government, one man or 
[one] woman can stand on the floor of 
the Senate and resist the passions of 
the moment.’’ 
Again, in 2005, Senator CHUCK SCHU-
MER also said that eliminating the fili-
buster would be a ‘‘doomsday for de-
mocracy’’ that would turn our country 
into, in his words, a ‘‘banana republic.’’ 
Former Senator Robert Byrd wrote 
about preserving the filibuster. We 
heard it many times today. He said: 
We must never, ever, tear down the only 
wall—the necessary fence—this nation has 
against the excesses of the Executive Branch 
and the resultant haste and tyranny of the 
majority. 
He went on to say: 
The Senate has been the last fortress of 
minority rights and freedom of speech in this 
Republic for more than two centuries. I pray 
that Senators will pause and reflect before 
ignoring that history and tradition in favor 
of the political priority of the moment. 
As Leader MCCONNELL quoted on the 
floor yesterday, ‘‘[T]he smallest major-
ity we have ever seen in our politics is 
trying to change the rules for how peo-
ple get elected in every State.’’ 
You may recall, Republicans were 
asked to do this exact thing when we 
controlled every lever of government, 
and we refused to make that change be-
cause of the importance of the fili-
buster to this institution. Eliminating 
or weakening the legislative filibuster 
would destroy the intentional design of 
the Senate to be the world’s most de-
liberative body. It would allow any

small majority in the Senate to strip 
the voice of millions of Americans con-
sidered in the minority. 
Removing the ability to filibuster 
legislation would reduce the incentive 
for the Senate to forge broad agree-
ments and force further debate and 
would likely increase divisiveness rath-
er than efficiency. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this Federal takeover of our State’s 
constitutional right to manage their 
own elections, and I urge my col-
leagues to reject this unfounded as-
sault on the Senate filibuster. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this has 
been an interesting day of debate. It 
actually feels good to hear people real-
ly speak on an issue. As President pro 
tempore, I sat in that chair where my 
distinguished friend from Maine is sit-
ting now as Presiding Officer. I sat 
there for hours today and listened to 
the debate and heard many I found ex-
tremely good and then I heard some 
others. But I appreciate the fact that I 
had the opportunity, as President pro 
tempore, to hear so many of the Sen-
ators of both parties speak. 
You know, I spoke yesterday about 
protecting everyone’s vote on the bal-
lot and how important that is. I know 
that because in my own State of 
Vermont, when I first ran, it was a 
very Republican State. I have been on 
the ballot, between my time as State’s 
attorney and Senator, between pri-
maries and general elections—I have 
been on the ballot in Vermont 24 times. 
I never questioned that the ballots 
would be counted accurately and hon-
estly, even though, in several of the 
elections, 80 to 90 percent of the people 
counting the ballots were the town 
clerks, and they were Republicans. 
So after those 24 times, I think I 
have some idea of how the Senate 
works, and I can also say that with se-
niority comes a bit of experience. This 
is my 48th year here in the U.S. Sen-
ate, having been elected by those same 
Vermonters whom I praise for the way 
they protected the sanctity of the bal-
lot 48 times. I am still the only Demo-
crat sent to the U.S. Senate by the vot-
ers of Vermont. 
I have become the chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee, the former 
chairman and ranking member of the 
Judiciary and Agriculture Committees, 
and then honored three times to be 
elected as President pro tempore. So 
let me just take a couple minutes of 
your indulgence to talk about what the 
Senate was, what it has become, and 
what it can be again. 
I think my experience qualifies me to 
say that. My conscience compels me to 
say that. We, each of us, stand on the 
shoulders of giants. The Senators from 
across the political spectrum and from 
around this Nation who forged a path 
for America, they met the moment of 
the time not with timidity or fear but 
with action and with decisiveness. 
Now, was the road taken an easy one? 
No. Was the struggle short? No. But 
was it worth the sacrifice, the dedica-
tion, the commitment, and, yes, the 
compromise, to meet it? Of course. 
But before the Senate today is the 
issue that is at the heart of our very 
government, the right to vote—the one 
thing we can hold sacred, no matter 
what party we belong to, the right to 
vote. 
Time and time again, the Constitu-
tion has been amended to expand the 
right to vote, not to restrict it but to 
expand it. Look at the 15th Amend-
ment, the 19th, the 24th, the 26th. 
These each gave greater access to the 
ballot box for Americans; it furthered 
the shared goals that ours be the most 
inclusive and most democratic Nation 
on Earth. 
But today, we do have a scourge of 
laws—no matter what we say on the 
floor, the facts are we have a scourge of 
laws making their way through par-
tisan legislatures across the country. 
They roll back the tides of time, ruin-
ing the most fundamental right, all at 
a time when technology and pure com-
mon sense should tell us that voting 
should be a lot more accessible than it 
is and coupled with a challenge from 
the Supreme Court that the Congress 
affirmatively act. Remember, the Su-
preme Court said why doesn’t Congress 
step in and act to restore the long bi-
partisan Voting Rights Act. There is no 
more important time than now for us 
to meaningfully address this constitu-
tional right, this foundational right. 
Now, there are some honest questions 
to ask here of ourselves and each other. 
Do we really want to make it more dif-
ficult for Americans to vote legally 
and safely? 
Is that what democracy means to 
you, to me? Do we really want to allow 
States to make it more difficult for 
blue-collar workers or the poor or the 
disadvantaged to vote, when the great 
advances of time and technology are 
there where you can easily make it 
easier—easier—to vote, not more dif-
ficult. 
Are we really going to turn back the 
clock to an era where State and local 
jurisdictions can blatantly discrimi-
nate against certain voters—yes, peo-
ple of color and minority populations— 
by simply rigging the systems of vot-
ing or counting or changing the map, 
to erase the progress of generations 
and make meaningless the fight of 
lions like John Lewis, Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., and so many others? Is 
that really what we stand for in this 
century? Were we elected by our con-
stituents to flatly obstruct any action 
in this body simply because our party 
is not in the majority or were we elect-
ed to tacitly agree with a prescribed 
agenda? The Senate and those who 
stand in it owe more to our constitu-
ents and to this Nation than blind 
party loyalty. We owe it to the Nation 
to do what is right. We owe it to our 
conscience to do what is right. Par-
tisan 
disagreements, 
divisions, 
and 
stalemates dot the pages of our young 
Nation’s history when you go back and 
read it, but it is the moments of bipar-
tisanship that punctuate it. 
So I would ask a question of our two 
leaders. 
Mr. Majority Leader, should we not 
have a debate, a real debate, on these 
issues, with amendments, unbound by 
deadlines or time limits? 
In answer to that, I also ask of the 
minority leader: Do we not have an ob-
ligation to Americans, to your con-
stituents and mine, to at least talk 
about these issues, offer honest and 
meaningful proposals, and then vote 
them up or vote them down? 
Are we not intended to be the great-
est deliberative body in the world? It 
probably was when I came here, but 
these days, we surely are not. 
History 
will 
remember 
this 
mo-
ment—a moment when we stood for the 
foundational right of our democracy— 
the right to vote—or we stood against 
it. Long have I said on this floor that 
the conscience of the Nation rests in 
the U.S. Senate—or it should. Today, 
we—each of us who has sworn to uphold 
the Constitution as a Member of this 
great body—must examine our own 
conscience. We must decide whether it 
will be the politics of exclusion or the 
justice of inclusion that will be the in-
delible mark of the 117th Congress, and 
we must decide if the Senate envi-
sioned by our Founders can be re-
stored. 
The giants, the lions of the Senate, 
are the Members who rise above to 
meet these moments and who have the 
courage to do what is right. If our jobs 
were easy, anyone could do them, but 
throughout history, fewer than 2,000 
Americans have had the honor, the 
privilege, and the responsibility to hold 
the title of ‘‘U.S. Senator.’’ 
I have been proud to serve with one 
out of every five of those Senators— 
some I agreed with, some I disagreed 
with. But I can say this: We, the 100 
here today, are caretakers of a legacy 
far greater than our own. We shoulder 
the responsibility of a nation—a nation 
founded under the principle that gov-
ernments are instituted among their 
people, deriving their just powers from 
the consent of the governed. 
I fear that, if we let this moment— 
this pivotal moment—pass us by with 
no debate, no action, and no advance-
ment, we will not only be derelict in 
our duty, but we will betray the very 
oath we swore when we stood in front 
of the desk at which the Presiding Offi-
cer is sitting and pledged to defend the 
Constitution and to continue the end-
less goal of forming a more perfect 
Union. 
We should pass the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act, but we should at 
the very least have the courage to de-
bate it. 
I feel such privilege 
in 
serving 
Vermont. I feel such privilege to have 
been on the ballot 24 times in our State 
because I can always trust that every-
body who wanted to vote could. 
Today, we have the technology and 
the ability to have far more people

vote. Don’t we owe it to this country 
and don’t we owe it to our oath of of-
fice to do that? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Another 
Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we are 
running out of Senators from Vermont. 
I think that is it. 
(Laughter.) 
Let me begin by thanking a number 
of my Senate colleagues who have 
worked so hard on this issue. Let me 
thank, 
among 
others, 
Senators 
MERKLEY, KLOBUCHAR, BOOKER, WAR-
NER, KING, LEAHY, DURBIN, KAINE, and 
others for their efforts on this impor-
tant issue. 
I will be brief because there is not a 
whole lot that I can add to the excel-
lent statements that so many other 
Senators have made. Let me just say 
this: For some, the issue we are debat-
ing today may seem complicated, to be 
understood only by lawyers, constitu-
tional scholars, and those handfuls of 
people who actually understand the 
opaque rules of the U.S. Senate. I just 
want to say that, if this is what you 
think, you are wrong. What we are de-
bating today is not complicated; it is 
really quite simple. Here is what it is 
about. 
Joe Biden won the 2020 Presidential 
election, period. You may have liked 
that result or you may not have liked 
it, but he won. He won in an election 
that Donald Trump’s own Department 
of Homeland Security determined to be 
the most secure election in American 
history. 
After the election, Trump and his 
supporters filed more than 60 lawsuits 
in State and Federal courts, repeating 
their false claims and trying to reverse 
the election results. These lawsuits 
were rejected time and time again, in-
cluding with judges whom Trump him-
self appointed. Nonetheless, the former 
President continued to claim—and to 
this day continues to claim despite all 
of the evidence—that the election was 
stolen and that he actually won in a 
landslide. 
Not only are his statements and ac-
tions delusional, they are worse. In re-
peating this Big Lie over and over 
again, he not only cast doubts about 
the 2020 election, but, in fact, in a dis-
graceful and unprecedented way for a 
President, he is undermining the very 
foundations of American democracy. 
Shamefully, Republican leaders all 
across this country, including Repub-
lican Members of the U.S. Senate, ei-
ther repeated Trump’s lies or tried to 
walk a very, very thin line around 
them. Trump’s one-man dominance 
over the Republican Party is now so 
strong that few Republican officials are 
prepared to state openly what they 
know in their hearts to be true, and 
that is that Trump is a pathological 
liar and a threat to democracy and this 
country and our very way of life. 
In any case, the predictable result of 
all of this was that Republican Gov-
ernors and legislatures all over this 
country saw Trump’s Big Lie and 
fearmongering as an opportunity—a 
golden opportunity—to solidify their 
political positions. 
Acting under the guise of voter integ-
rity, despite the fact that our Nation 
has very little voter fraud—thank 
God—they proceeded to pass election 
laws in 19 States that make it harder 
for people to vote, with a special focus 
on people of color, young people, poor 
people, and people with disabilities— 
people who might be inclined to vote 
against them. In many cases, they also 
created election districts through ex-
treme gerrymandering that have no ra-
tionale other than to make certain 
that Republicans retain control over 
State legislatures. In other cases, they 
are cutting back on the authority of 
independent election officials and giv-
ing that power to partisan legislatures. 
Today, in order to address this crisis 
in American democracy, Members of 
the Senate will be casting two very im-
portant votes. 
The first will be on the Freedom to 
Vote Act. This bill goes a long way to 
ending voter suppression and, in fact, 
making it easier, not harder, for Amer-
ican citizens to vote. It establishes 
automatic voter registration and on-
line voter registration. It celebrates 
democracy by making election day a 
national holiday so that people can 
vote at a time other than after work. It 
establishes uniform early voting and 
same-day registration. 
This bill also ends partisan gerry-
mandering and roots out the undue in-
fluence of special interest money in 
buying elections. Imagine that. Imag-
ine that. We would actually know the 
names of billionaires who put huge 
amounts of money into super PACs 
that buy elections. What a terrible 
thing. We would actually know who 
these people are. 
This bill would also provide increased 
protection in the voting process to vot-
ers with disabilities, the military, 
overseas voters, and underserved com-
munities, and much, much more. 
This is a very significant piece of leg-
islation. Now, why would anybody be 
opposed to it? Why, in a nation that 
has a history of denying the vote to Af-
rican Americans, denying the vote to 
Native Americans, denying the vote to 
women, denying the vote to low-in-
come Whites, would any fairminded 
person be in opposition to making it 
easier for all citizens to vote? 
That is what I understood when I 
went to elementary school. You know, 
you play by the rules. You do your 
best. Sometimes you win, and some-
times you lose. That is the process. But 
no one ever told me that what politics 
is about is working overtime to try to 
prevent people from voting just be-
cause they might vote against you. 
Our job should be to increase voter 
turnout and make it easier for people 
to participate, which is what this legis-
lation does. I want this country to have 
the highest voter turnout of any na-
tion’s on Earth, not one of the lowest. 
But let’s be clear. This enormously 
important bill—a bill to protect the 
foundations of American democracy— 
will fail. It will fail because, according 
to Senate rules, it will require 60 votes 
to pass, and in a 50–50 Senate, not one 
Republican will vote for it. It will like-
ly get 50 votes, which, with the Vice 
President 
casting 
the 
tie-breaking 
vote, would be enough to pass this leg-
islation under majority rule. It will not 
get 60 votes—all of which brings us to 
the second vote, which is really the 
most important vote of the day. 
That vote will determine whether 
anything we discuss today—whether 
any of the speeches that we give, any 
of the points that we actually make— 
will, in fact, become law. That is the 
vote to change Senate rules and estab-
lish a talking filibuster—a process 
which gives the minority an enormous 
amount of time to object to legislation 
and voice their concerns. The minority, 
whether it is a Democratic minority or 
a Republican minority, would have 
days and days and days to slow the 
process down and to rally the Amer-
ican people around their ideas, but 
they would not have forever. At the 
end of the time allotted, a majority 
vote would prevail, which, in my view, 
is what a democratic society is all 
about. 
Is changing the Senate rules a rad-
ical idea? Oh, my God. For the first 
time in history, we are about to do it. 
It has never been done before—well, 
really, not quite. No. As every Member 
of the Senate knows, the rules get 
changed on a fairly regular basis. 
There is nothing radical about it. Just 
a few months ago, in order to raise the 
debt ceiling and prevent our govern-
ment from defaulting on its loans, the 
rules were changed so that a 50-vote 
majority would prevail. We changed 
the rules appropriately, and we pre-
vented a default in a massive world-
wide depression. 
Just a few years ago, my Republican 
colleagues, 
who 
are 
so 
adamantly 
against changing rules, well, my good-
ness, they changed the Senate rules to 
allow 50 votes to confirm the Presi-
dent’s 
nominees 
for 
the 
Supreme 
Court—oh, my goodness, how shock-
ing—and they got three conservative 
Supreme Court Justices as a result. 
Rules get changed around here all of 
the time. And, maybe, just maybe, we 
might want to change the rules in 
order to save American democracy. 
Now, let me conclude by saying this. 
And I don’t know if any of my other 
colleagues have made this point, but I 
will. I regard it as a very sad day for 
our country—and I mean this very sin-
cerely—that not one Republican in this 
body is prepared to vote for this bill. 
Now, I understand why that is the 
case. I am in politics. I got it. I know 
who the leader of their party is. But 
this, I do not understand. I can under-
stand Republicans, but this, I do not 
understand. I do not understand why

stand the importance of the Freedom

to Vote Act—and, as I understand it, 
will vote for the Freedom to Vote 
Act—are not prepared to change the 
rules so that that bill could actually 
become law. That, I do not understand. 
If you think this bill makes sense 
and if you are worried about the future 
of American democracy and if you are 
prepared to vote for the bill, then why 
are you wasting everybody’s time and 
not voting for the rule change that al-
lows us to pass the bill? It is like invit-
ing somebody to lunch, putting out a 
great spread, and saying you can’t eat. 
If you are going to vote for the bill, 
vote to change the rules. 
If we can change the rules to prevent 
a default on our national debt, if we 
can change the rules to confirm Su-
preme Court Justices, we can certainly 
change the rules to save American de-
mocracy. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, Abra-
ham Lincoln must be turning in his 
grave to hear the Senators from the 
Grand Old Party—the party of aboli-
tion and emancipation and reconstruc-
tion—echoing the State’s rights rhet-
oric of Dixiecrat segregationists to op-
pose Federal voting rights legislation, 
to oppose even the reauthorization of 
the Voting Rights Act—the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
In 2021, just one Republican Senator 
had the courage and principle to vote 
to restore the Voting Rights Act of 
1965—the Senator from Alaska, Ms. 
MURKOWSKI—just one. 
For decades, the reauthorization of 
the Voting Rights Act was bipartisan. 
Today, only one Republican Senator 
will 
stand 
up 
for 
this 
landmark 
achievement of the civil rights move-
ment—not Senator CORNYN of Texas, 
who 
previously 
said, 
‘‘the 
Voting 
Rights Act is simply the most impor-
tant and most effective civil rights leg-
islation ever passed, bar none’’—no 
longer his position—not my friend the 
Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, who 
previously said, ‘‘This bill will ensure 
that the voting rights afforded to all 
Americans are protected’’; not Senator 
BURR
of North Carolina, who pre-
viously said, ‘‘Voting rights for all 
American citizens regardless of race 
[are] granted by the 15th Amendment 
and enforced by the Voting Rights 
Act’’; and not the minority leader, who 
previously said, ‘‘This is a good piece of 
legislation which has served an impor-
tant purpose over many years. . . . And 
this landmark piece of legislation will 
continue to make a difference not only 
in the South but for all [Americans] 
and for all of us, whether we are Afri-
can-Americans or not’’; not the minor-
ity leader, the same minority leader, 
who said, ‘‘This bill eliminated the bar-
riers to voting so that all Americans 
could participate in the basic oppor-
tunity each of us have,’’ who cele-
brated, ‘‘We have . . . renewed the Vot-
ing Rights Act periodically since that 
time, overwhelmingly, and on a bipar-
tisan basis, year after year . . . because 
members of Congress realize [that] this 
is a piece of legislation [that] has 
worked’’—no more, not in 2022. Only 
one Republican Senator stood up to 
support the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
When Congressman John Lewis and 
Hosea Williams and Amelia Boynton 
and hundreds of others marched across 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody 
Sunday, when John Lewis had his skull 
fractured on that bridge for daring to 
demand the right to vote for Black 
Americans in the American South, it 
was the example of their courage and 
their sacrifice that paved the way for 
passage of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. 
As my colleague, my brother, Sen-
ator Reverend WARNOCK has often ob-
served, 
when 
Congressman 
Lewis 
passed, there were many in this Cham-
ber on both sides who rightly cele-
brated his towering achievements and 
his legacy. But I speak for the State of 
Georgia when I say: Do not invoke Con-
gressman Lewis’ name to signal your 
virtue while you work to erode his leg-
acy and defy his will. 
I have heard a lot from our Repub-
lican colleagues about the recently 
passed election law in the State of 
Georgia. Let’s be very clear. There is 
no one in Georgia on either side of the 
aisle who doubts or does not under-
stand precisely what its purpose is. 
Mr. WARNOCK. That is right. That is 
right. 
Mr. OSSOFF. Forbidding voter reg-
istration for run-off elections, driving 
down the early vote period during divi-
sive runoffs to drive up lines at major-
ity Black precincts. 
As he used to say, John Lewis didn’t 
give a little blood on that bridge that 
day so that Black Georgians would 
have to wait eight times longer to vote 
than White Georgians. John Lewis 
didn’t give a little bit of blood on that 
bridge that day so that State legisla-
tures across this country could pass 
legislation surgically targeted to make 
it harder for some people to vote, all 
for partisan power. 
In the State of Georgia, where now 
partisan election officials can step in 
and throw out locally elected election 
boards to change who can vote and 
where they can vote—this, in the after-
math of a well-known incident when 
the former President of the United 
States threatened Georgia’s secretary 
of state with criminal prosecution if he 
didn’t ‘‘find 11,000 votes’’ that were 
never cast for Donald Trump. 
The facts of the former President’s 
efforts to seize reelection, despite his 
defeat, are well-known. He and his lieu-
tenants 
mounted 
an 
unprecedented 
campaign to retain power based on a 
torrent of lies that have grievously 
wounded public confidence in our elec-
tions. And it was only thanks to the in-
tegrity of our laws and our courts and 
principled election officials and the 
will of Congress, the will of this Sen-
ate, to ensure the peaceful transition 
of power in the face of a violent assault 
on the U.S. Capitol that this con-
spiracy was defeated. 
So now, this faction seeks to dis-
mantle precisely those bulwarks which 
prevented their onslaught from suc-
ceeding. The choice is ours whether we 
will allow them to do so. 
We in the U.S. Congress, Madam Vice 
President, have the constitutional au-
thority to make the laws with respect 
to the administration of Federal elec-
tions. 
We in the U.S. Senate have an obliga-
tion to defend the legacy of Congress-
man John Lewis, to stand up for the sa-
cred franchise, to secure equal access 
to the ballot for every single American 
voter so that this country can continue 
its journey toward full realization of 
our founding ideals. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam Vice Presi-
dent, we have been summoned here by 
history. This is not just another rou-
tine day in the Senate. This is a moral 
moment in America. 
I recall the words of that great Amer-
ican patriot and prophet, Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., whose birthday all of us 
just observed. As he agonized over the 
difficulty and complexity of that moral 
moment, Dr. King said: ‘‘History has 
thrust something upon me from which 
I cannot turn away.’’ We have been 
summoned here, all of us. We cannot 
turn away. 
This is no time for politics as usual. 
The times cry out for moral leadership, 
for integrity, for empathy, and for care 
for one another, for deep investment in 
the covenant that we have with one an-
other as an American people. ‘‘E 
pluribus unum,’’ out of many, one— 
what a grand doctrine, what a noble 
idea, which our country has been striv-
ing to reach with fits and starts with 
setbacks and comebacks since the day 
of its founding. 
This is one of those moments. We 
cannot turn away. We cannot hide from 
history. And I am truly honored to 
stand here with all of you, Democrats, 
Republicans, and Independents, in this 
moment. And on this, my 365th day as 
a Member of the U.S. Senate, the most 
consequential deliberative body on the 
planet, striving, again, for greatness. 
I was elected from Georgia on Janu-
ary 5—what an honor to represent the 
people of the State of Georgia and what 
a great Nation, a kid from the Kayton 
Homes Housing Projects, the first col-
lege graduate in my family of 12. My 
folks are both preachers. They read the 
Scriptures: ‘‘Be fruitful and multiply.’’ 
But this kid who grew up in poverty is 
now serving in the U.S. Senate, only 
the 11th Black Senator in the whole 
history of our Nation. Also during that 
same time, Georgia also elected its 
first Jewish Senator, my brother JON 
OSSOFF. 
I believe that somewhere, in glory, 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rabbi 
Abraham Joshua Heschel are smiling 
because they marched together. Rabbi

January 19, 2022 
Heschel said that when he marched 
with Dr. King, he felt like his legs were 
praying. 
So what a moment. I won after a 
hard-fought election, and the next 
morning, I was feeling pretty good. My 
mother, who grew up in Waycross, GA, 
picking cotton as a teenager, had 
joined with other Georgians in record 
voter turnout, and the 82-year-old 
hands that used to pick somebody 
else’s cotton helped to pick her young-
est son to be a U.S. Senator. Only in 
America is my story even possible. 
I was on several of the morning 
shows talking about what the people of 
Georgia had achieved, and I was feeling 
pretty good that morning. Man, I was 
on ‘‘The View’’ talking to Whoopi 
Goldberg. But by lunchtime, the news 
alerts on my phone began to buzz. 
Something was happening in the Cap-
itol. And we all know the rest of that 
sad and tragic story: a violent assault 
on our Nation’s Capitol driven by the 
Big Lie, ugly words, signs and symbols 
of racism and anti-Semitism, an effort 
to stop the legal certification of an 
election. 
In spite of those who want to hide, 
sadly, January 6 really did happen, and 
we must face up to it. We cannot hide 
from history. January 6 happened. But 
here is the thing: January 5 also hap-
pened. Georgia, a State in the old Con-
federacy, sent a Black man and a Jew-
ish man to the Senate in one fell 
swoop. 
Our Nation has always had a com-
plicated history, and I submit to you 
that here is where we are. We are 
swinging from a moral dilemma. We 
are caught somewhere between Janu-
ary 5 and January 6, between our hopes 
and our fears, between bigotry and be-
loved community. In each moment, we 
the people have to decide which way 
are we going to go and what we are 
willing to sacrifice in order to get 
there. 
The question today is, Are we going 
to give in to a violent attack whose 
aim is now being pursued through par-
tisan voter suppression laws in State 
legislatures? 
Sadly, Georgia, the same Georgia 
that sent me and my brother, OSSOFF, 
to the Senate—not the people of Geor-
gia; partisan State politicians have de-
cided to punish their own citizens for 
having the audacity to show up. 
It isn’t just about the restrictions 
around water and food distribution. 
The more fundamental question is, 
Why are the lines so long in the first 
place, and why is that the case in cer-
tain communities? 
I know that some Americans listen-
ing to me right now don’t know what 
we mean because that is not your expe-
rience, but it is the experience of so 
many of your fellow Americans. We 
need empathy, compassion, care for 
one another. 
Why are local election officials work-
ing in Lincoln County, GA, to close all 
but one polling location for a county 
that is bigger than 250 square miles? 
Why is the second most powerful legis-
lator in the Georgia State Senate 
working right now to pass legislation 
to eliminate all ballot drop boxes in 
Georgia in the middle of a pandemic? 
Why are State leaders in Georgia right 
now working to take over the local 
elections board in Fulton County, 
where Ebenezer Baptist Church sits? 
There is a woman in Cobb County 
named Irish. She says she has tried re-
peatedly over the past 10 years to vote 
but could not because of long lines and 
changing 
polling 
locations—people 
playing games. She said that she has 
often had to decide if she will work or 
vote. 
Another woman, Varana, from Cobb 
County says that she waited in line for 
8 hours in the rain at her local li-
brary—8 hours—to vote. 
I run into constituents all the time 
who tell me that they waited for hours 
to vote for me. I am honored that they 
voted for me, but I am sad that they 
should have to wait for 8 hours. 
A student in Atlanta named Isabella 
says that she and many of her friends 
could not vote in the November 2020 
election because they did not want to 
skip class to stand in line. 
Why are State leaders in Georgia be-
having as if giving voters these awful 
choices is normal or that voters like 
these Georgians don’t exist? 
Those are the facts of the laws that 
are being passed in Georgia and across 
our Nation. 
So here is the question tonight: 
America, are we January 5 or are we 
January 6? Are we going to give in to 
the forces that seek to divide us by ger-
rymandering us, suppressing us, and 
subverting the voices of some of us in 
pursuit of power at any cost, or are we 
going to live up to that grand Amer-
ican covenant ‘‘e pluribus unum’’— 
‘‘out of many, one’’? I choose what Dr. 
King called ‘‘beloved community.’’ I 
choose America. I choose a nation that 
embraces all of us. 
We have been summoned here. We 
cannot turn away. In just a few mo-
ments, all 100 of us, blessed with a sa-
cred trust, will let the American people 
know where we stand on the question 
of whether the Senate will protect 
their voices, the voices of the very peo-
ple who sent us here, or if we will sim-
ply surrender to the anti-democratic 
fervor and polarizing disunity spread-
ing across our Nation. 
In the meantime, let me say that I 
am glad that we are finally actually 
having a debate on the Senate floor. 
Imagine that. The Senate—what is 
that?—the most important deliberative 
body—is actually having a debate. It 
took us nearly a year to get to this 
point, and I want to thank my col-
leagues who worked with me and oth-
ers over the last many months to keep 
this critical issue on the Senate’s front 
burner. 
Voting rights are preservative of all 
other rights. The democracy is the 
framework in which all other debates 
take place. We can strengthen our in-
frastructure and the infrastructure of 
our democracy at the same time. If we 
can change the rules to raise the debt 
ceiling, we can change the rules to 
raise and repair the ceiling of our de-
mocracy. This is our work. 
So we have crafted a strong piece of 
compromise legislation that will ad-
dress the rampant voter suppression 
and election subversion laws we are 
seeing passed in State after State after 
State—19 so far and counting. The 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act 
will restore bedrock voting protections 
established by the Voting Rights Act of 
1965—protections that have been eroded 
by the Supreme Court and are born 
from an era where Members of this 
body used to work together to solve 
the tough issues of our time. It will 
also set a Federal baseline for voting 
standards to ensure every eligible voter 
has access to the ballot, no matter 
where they live, and to protect elec-
tions from subversion by craven politi-
cians. 
Voting rights should be bipartisan; 
used to be bipartisan; passed this body 
the last time 98 to 0 and signed into 
law by George W. Bush, a Republican 
President. 
I know that my colleagues and I have 
worked in good faith this past year, 
this entire year. We have worked hard 
to try to find some common ground 
with our Republican friends on this 
issue. 
I have said to my colleagues: Let us 
bring these measures to the floor to de-
bate. Let’s reason. Let’s deliberate. 
I had hoped our friends on the other 
side would have allowed us to have a 
debate on voting rights legislation, but 
until today, that is what they have 
blocked three times in the Senate. 
They didn’t block the bills; they 
blocked our ability to even have debate 
on the bills. 
As a pastor, I understand the power 
and the possibility of coming together 
with those with whom we disagree to 
have a robust debate on the issues that 
are important to families and to our 
country. I share with many of you, I 
am sure, a vision of the Senate that 
collaborates and negotiates on the 
most important issues of our time. 
I believe in bipartisanship, but when 
it comes to something as fundamental 
as voting rights, I just have to ask: Bi-
partisanship at what cost? Who is 
being asked to foot the bill for this bi-
partisanship? And is liberty itself the 
cost? I submit that that is a cost too 
high and a bridge too far. 
I am deeply saddened that our Repub-
lican colleagues chose not to join us in 
this effort. Democrats would prefer not 
to act alone, but, by all means, we have 
to act. Even if we don’t get it done to-
night, we have to keep working at it 
until we get it done. 
Dr. King’s words are as true now as 
they were back then: ‘‘History has 
thrust something upon me from which 
I cannot turn away.’’ He said: ‘‘Justice 
delayed is justice denied.’’ 
Now, I know that I have been speak-
ing a lot over the course of the last

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S334 
January 19, 2022 
year about voting rights, and it is one 
of my—one of my—primary passions. 
But I am thrilled to work for Georgians 
to close the Medicaid coverage gap in 
our State; to create new, good-paying 
jobs in growing and emerging indus-
tries; to strengthen broadband across 
our State; and more. I am thrilled to 
fight for these priorities for Georgia 
because that is what Georgians sent me 
here to do, but they sent me with their 
votes. 
How can we have productive con-
versations about the many issues af-
fecting the American people—about 
lowering healthcare costs, about cre-
ating good-paying jobs, about fighting 
climate change, protecting reproduc-
tive healthcare—if politicians in States 
get to cherry-pick their voters and the 
people’s voices are squeezed out of 
their democracy? How can we achieve 
real consensus on the issues that mat-
ter most if only some voters can be 
heard? 
Taking action to pass voting rights 
legislation is not a policy argument; it 
is about the democracy itself. Voting 
rights is how we address the deepening 
divides in our country, by ensuring 
every eligible voter’s voice is heard. 
We, as elected representatives, have an 
obligation to protect their voice. 
So when it comes to the question of 
procedure and the filibuster, let me be 
clear: I believe that voting rights are 
more important than a procedural rule, 
and if taking action requires a change 
in the rules, then it is time to change 
the rules. 
When the times changed, we have al-
ways changed the rules—160 times. 
And as we consider the filibuster, the 
name of the Senator from West Vir-
ginia, Robert Byrd, inevitably comes 
up. His is an important perspective, 
but we shouldn’t quote him as if he is 
Scripture. In fact, he didn’t always get 
it right. He said his greatest regret was 
filibustering the 1964 civil rights bill. 
Robert Byrd learned from history. Will 
we? 
As I continue on what may feel like 
a filibuster, some point to Senate pro-
cedure, while others recycle excuses we 
heard before. But as the pastor of Ebe-
nezer Baptist Church, I also know that 
all of these arguments against taking 
the moral action we are called to take 
are distractions. 
Consider this. There are some things 
you can do in this Chamber with just 51 
votes: confirm a Supreme Court nomi-
nee, 51; pass trillions of dollars in in-
vestments for our communities, 51; 
pass massive tax cuts, mainly for the 
richest of the rich, 51; confirm Cabinet 
nominees, 51; raise the debt ceiling—we 
found a way to do it the other week— 
51. But it takes 60 votes to repair the 
ceiling of our democracy by passing 
voting rights legislation. 
I am left to conclude that if the issue 
is important enough, the Senate feels 
compelled to act. Well, let me say that 
I believe that the democracy is at least 
as important as the economy. Re-
cently, many of our colleagues have ar-
gued that legislation to protect voting 
rights somehow offends our Federal 
system of government and amounts, 
they say, to a Federal takeover of elec-
tions. 
Some of the same voices, ironically, 
who have extolled Dr. King’s life this 
week have, at the same time, been 
working vigorously against the legisla-
tion we are debating today to protect 
the right to vote, and many of them 
have been channeling old States’ rights 
arguments. 
Let the message go out. You cannot 
remember Martin Luther King, Jr., and 
dismember his legacy at the same 
time. You can argue whatever side you 
want, but you do not get to argue both 
sides. I will not sit quietly while some 
make Dr. King a victim of identity 
theft. You do not get to offer praises 
and plaudits in memory of Dr. King 
and then marshal the same kind of 
States’ rights arguments that were 
used against Dr. King and against the 
civil rights movement. 
Please know that as the pastor of Dr. 
King’s church, this argument evokes, I 
say really respectfully—it evokes— 
some of the darkest moments in our 
country’s long struggle for equality. 
When the Supreme Court ruled that 
school 
segregation 
was 
unconstitu-
tional in Brown v. Board of Education, 
after a century of Jim Crow laws, Ar-
kansas Governor Orval Fabus did not 
argue that he supported segregation at 
all costs. He, instead, claimed that 
obeying the Brown decision amounted 
to a ‘‘surrender’’ of ‘‘all our rights,’’ he 
said, ‘‘as citizens to an all powerful 
Federal autocracy.’’ 
When 
Senator 
Strom 
Thurmond 
launched the longest filibuster in the 
United States, against a bill to protect 
voting rights, he didn’t argue explicitly 
that Black people didn’t deserve to 
vote. He, instead, claimed that it was 
‘‘unlawful and unconstitutional’’ for 
Congress to regulate the elections of 
the States. 
And during the Senate’s 60-day de-
bate on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the 
closing argument of the bill’s oppo-
nents—led and articulated by Georgia 
Senator Richard B. Russell—was that 
it would ‘‘strike down and destroy 
many rights and powers which, since 
the foundation of our government have 
properly belonged to several States.’’ 
Let’s be very clear about this legisla-
tion. The States will continue to ad-
minister 
their 
elections. 
And, 
of 
course, States have certain rights. Do 
we genuinely believe that States have 
a right to discriminate, to suppress, or 
to block access to ballot boxes for so 
many Americans? 
Although we are 50 unique States, we 
are also united as one Republic, and 
what happens in one State can affect 
us all. When we elect our U.S. Senators 
and our U.S. Representatives, and 
when we elect the President, we must 
represent all Americans; we need every 
vote to count to maintain the integrity 
of our democracy. And so we must do 
this work. 
I support reforming the Electoral 
Count Act. That said, reforming the 
Electoral Count Act will do virtually 
nothing to address the sweeping voter 
suppression and election subversion ef-
forts taking place in Georgia and in 
States and localities nationwide. It 
doesn’t matter if your votes are prop-
erly counted if you cannot cast your 
vote in the first place. 
And so, as I close, I want to appeal to 
all of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle, not just as a colleague but as 
a pastor and as a man of faith. The 
American people have sent us here, and 
history has summoned us to this mo-
ment. We cannot hide. Whatever the 
outcome tonight, I still believe in us. I 
believe in the U.S. I believe in us. I be-
lieve that democracy is the political 
enactment of a spiritual idea, that we 
are all children of God and therefore we 
all ought to have a voice in the direc-
tion of our country and our destiny 
within it. I believe that a vote is a kind 
of prayer for the world we desire for 
ourselves and for our children and that 
our prayers are stronger when we pray 
together. 
A young Martin Luther King, Jr., 
struggled all those years ago, and he 
said: ‘‘History has thrust something 
upon me from which I cannot turn 
away.’’ Those of us who are students of 
Dr. King—I know I have—often wonder: 
What would I have done if I were alive 
during the civil rights movement? I 
know we would all like to think that 
we, too, would have had just a small 
fraction—just a fraction—of the cour-
age that it took for John Lewis to 
cross that Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
Well, for those of us who are fortu-
nate enough to have served in the U.S. 
Senate in this moment—in this moral 
moment—we do not have to wonder. 
My God, he faced troopers on the other 
side, crossing that bridge. We are talk-
ing about a procedural bridge. We don’t 
have to wonder what we would have 
done. I submit that what we would 
have done back then we are doing right 
now. History is watching us. Our chil-
dren are counting on us. And I hope 
that we will have the courage to do 
what is right for our communities and 
for our country, the courage to cross 
this bridge, to do the hard work in this 
defining moral moment in America for 
the sake of the communities that sent 
us here in the first place—for the sake 
of 
the 
planet, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
healthcare, for the sake of jobs, for the 
sake of being able to argue for the 
things that we care about—the courage 
to fight for one another. 
I am still praying that we will cross 
that bridge, but, if not tonight, we will 
come back again and again and again. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam Vice Presi-
dent, I rise today in support of two im-
portant voting rights bills the Senate 
is now considering, the Freedom to 
Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
The Freedom to Vote Act would pro-

January 19, 2022 
all voters to vote by mail, providing a 
minimum of 15 days of early in-person 
voting for Federal elections, and allow-
ing same-day voter registration at poll-
ing places. The bill would also protect 
nonpartisan election officials from in-
terference and intimidation and end 
partisan gerrymandering of congres-
sional districts. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act would restore the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 by allowing the 
Justice Department to prevent dis-
criminatory State voting laws from 
taking effect. 
The need for Federal legislation to 
protect the sacred and fundamental 
right to vote is clear. Over the last 
year, we have witnessed a disturbing 
increase in efforts by State legislatures 
across the country to make it harder 
for eligible voters to access and cast 
their ballots. 
Last year, legislators in 49 States in-
troduced more than 440 bills that would 
make it harder to vote and easier for 
improper, partisan interference in our 
election processes. At least 34 of these 
restrictive bills have become law in 19 
States. 
For example, one new law in Georgia 
gives 
the 
partisan 
State 
election 
board—composed 
of 
members 
ap-
pointed by the majority party of the 
State 
legislature—the 
authority 
to 
take over election administration from 
the existing nonpartisan county boards 
of elections that have historically been 
responsible for conducting elections. 
Another example is a new law in 
Iowa that makes it harder for Ameri-
cans with disabilities to vote by re-
stricting access to absentee ballots and 
restricting who is allowed to help vot-
ers with disabilities return their bal-
lots. 
And across the country in red and 
blue States alike, State legislators are 
engaging in partisan gerrymandering, 
strategically redrawing congressional 
and State legislative maps to prevent 
some voters from fully participating in 
the political process by diluting the 
power of their votes. 
This partisan gerrymandering, in ef-
fect, allows elected officials to choose 
their voters rather than allowing vot-
ers to choose their elected officials. 
This allows one party to design maps 
that give it a disproportionate edge in 
State legislatures and delegations in 
the House of Representatives. It also 
has an outsized impact on minority 
communities, who all too often see 
their votes diluted when maps are 
drawn to minimize their voting clout. 
The right to vote is a cornerstone of 
our democracy, enshrined in our Con-
stitution. And the Constitution also 
makes clear that it is the duty of Con-
gress to ensure that the fundamental 
right to vote is protected. 
Sadly, this legislation has become a 
partisan issue, even though voting 
rights has traditionally passed the Sen-
ate by a strong bipartisan majority and 
been signed into law by Presidents of 
both parties. In today’s Senate, it has 
become all too easy for either party to 
block action on important legislation. 
Blocking debate or preventing votes is 
as easy as denying requests for unani-
mous consent; Senators don’t even 
have to enter into debate or explain 
their opposition to a measure. 
Having been in the Senate since 1992 
and seen important legislation pass 
this body, I have resisted calls to 
change the Senate rules and to limit 
the rights of the minority. But the 
Senate filibuster, which was intended 
to be a tool to promote bipartisanship, 
has become a tool to stop almost any 
major legislation. 
When Americans thinks about the fil-
ibuster, many recall the image of 
Jimmy Stewart in ‘‘Mr. Smith Goes to 
Washington,’’ speaking on the Senate 
floor, actively debating a piece of legis-
lation and explaining their support or 
opposition. It is time that we return to 
that tradition of debate and not use 
the filibuster to prevent us from even 
talking about a bill. 
If my Republican colleagues want to 
block this voting rights legislation, I 
believe they should have to stand on 
the Senate floor and explain to the 
American people why that is the case, 
even as the right to vote is under at-
tack in statehouses across the country. 
As representatives of the American 
people, we should be fighting to protect 
the fundamental right to vote, not 
standing in the way of it. It should 
never be a legislator’s goal to make it 
harder for eligible voters to cast their 
ballots. 
We cannot wait any longer. It is time 
for Congress to do the job the Constitu-
tion gave us: To ensure that the right 
to vote is protected. 
Mr. REED. Madam Vice President, 
the right to vote is sacred, the heart of 
any democracy. And in a proud, though 
painful tradition, successive genera-
tions of Americans have fought to ex-
pand and protect that right and ensure 
that we as a country live up to our 
democratic ideals. Many risked their 
safety and even gave their lives in the 
fight for the right to vote. From Fred-
erick Douglass to Lucy Burns, from Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., to John 
Lewis, and countless other unnamed 
and unknown patriots, Americans have 
long taken it upon themselves to make 
their Union more perfect. 
It is because of the sacrifice and 
unyielding activism of those brave 
Americans that the 14th, 15th, 19th, 
23rd, 24th, and 26th Amendments were 
ratified; the Indian Citizenship Act was 
passed; the Chinese Exclusion Act was 
repealed; and in 1965, the landmark leg-
islation of the Voting Rights Act was 
enacted. 
That 
transformative 
law, 
along with its bipartisan renewals over 
the following decades, helped set us on 
a path to representation across the Na-
tion that better reflected the diversity 
of the American people and better en-
sured the right to vote. 
We cannot allow these hard-earned 
advances to be reversed. 
Yet, as we speak, instead of pre-
serving the right to vote, Republicans 
are finding new and insidious ways to 
make it harder to cast ballots. Why 
else would they oppose secure, effec-
tive, verifiable mail-in ballots? What 
other reason is there for curtailing 
early voting and weekend voting? 
These regressive new laws sprouting up 
across the country are clearly meant 
to discourage voters, particularly peo-
ple of color, young people, people with 
disabilities, and the working class. 
That is not just malicious; it is an as-
sault on America’s ideals. 
In this moment of crisis, only Con-
gress can step in to repair the breach 
by passing the Freedom to Vote: John 
R. Lewis Act. We cannot wait for oth-
ers to act. Chief Justice Roberts ruled 
that Congress needs to change the Vot-
ing Rights Act to preserve its protec-
tions for millions of Americans. 
At the State level, at least 19 States 
passed laws restricting access to voting 
in 2021, and a number of States have 
begun to allow partisan actors to inter-
fere with election processes or even re-
ject election results entirely. Blatant 
gerrymandering is diluting the voice of 
minorities and election procedures are 
being tampered with as nonpartisan 
safeguards fall to the wayside. 
In the face of this dire onslaught 
against our democracy, the Constitu-
tion is clear that Congress has both the 
power and the responsibility to restore 
the protections of the Voting Rights 
Act and to ensure greater election in-
tegrity in our country. 
And this isn’t a case of so-called red 
States and blue States. Every State 
needs to do more to preserve access to 
the ballot box, and the bill before us 
ensures that Federal elections in every 
State will be more secure and more ac-
cessible to voters. It sets standards 
that every State can meet and provides 
the resources for them to do so. 
Considering the magnitude and ur-
gency of the need for election reforms, 
I am dismayed by Republicans who 
have spent months blockading a discus-
sion of these bills on the Senate floor 
while also refusing to negotiate over 
any specifics. 
Sadly, we have been here before. In 
1890, then-Representative Henry Cabot 
Lodge introduced a Federal elections 
bill that would reinforce the 15th 
Amendment and combat the wave of 
laws disenfranchising Black voters in 
the South. Though it passed the House, 
a weeklong Senate filibuster by South-
ern Democrats and some Western Re-
publicans led to the defeat of the legis-
lation in 1891. Imagine—where would 
we be if voting rights legislation had 
existed in the 1890s instead of having to 
wait until 1965? How many thousands 
of lynchings that took place in those 75 
years may have been avoided if Black 
voters could have had a voice in who 
was their sheriff, their judge, their 
mayor, their Representative, their Sen-
ator, their President? How many gen-
erations of Black children would have 
had running water, proper books, and 
qualified teachers in their school-
houses?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S336 
January 19, 2022 
I hope and believe that history will 
not repeat itself in such a gruesome 
fashion. But I do believe that the im-
pact of the current disenfranchisement 
will be felt acutely in minority com-
munities, by seniors and those with 
disabilities, and among young people. 
Without 
a 
voice, 
their 
legitimate 
claims for opportunity and equality 
will be muted, and huge discrepancies 
in income, education, and opportunity 
will be perpetuated. 
We have tried negotiating with the 
other side. We have offered an open de-
bate to the other side. We have held 
hearings and taken to the floor to out-
line the dangers of these State voting 
changes to our democracy, but the 
other side continues to say ‘‘no’’ to a 
debate and ‘‘no’’ to a vote. 
While many of my colleagues on the 
other side voted to certify the 2020 
election and some even voted to im-
peach the former President for his role 
in the January 6 assault on the Capitol, 
by blocking this bill, they are abetting 
the former President and his unelected 
media allies in spreading the lie that 
an election that brought more Repub-
licans to the House of Representatives 
was somehow ‘‘stolen.’’ That claim was 
false then, and it is false now. 
In allowing falsehoods about the elec-
tion results of 2020 to proliferate, in 
celebrating and minimizing the horrors 
of January 6, Republicans have chosen 
a path of seeking short-term wins, not 
realizing that when democracy loses, 
we all lose. 
I have a deep respect for Senate rules 
and precedent, and I have a strong 
skepticism when I hear suggestions of 
changing those rules. I know that what 
goes around can come around, so what 
may seem beneficial in the moment 
can become deeply detrimental in the 
future. 
The filibuster has its place, but at a 
certain point, the right of every eligi-
ble American to exercise their right to 
vote takes precedence because you can-
not have a democracy if your citizens 
cannot vote. It is that simple. 
For that existential reason, I will 
vote to change the rules for the pur-
poses of this bill and enforce rule XIX 
so that Senators must actually take to 
the floor and make their case to the 
American people rather than hide be-
hind procedure when it comes to voting 
rights. 
Our future as a democracy depends 
on the willingness of this body to do 
the right thing and protect voting 
rights by passing the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act. I implore my col-
leagues: Let’s do the right thing, and 
let’s do it now. 
Ms. SMITH. Madam Vice President, I 
rise today with my Democratic col-
leagues in support of one fundamental 
idea, the cornerstone of our democracy: 
that every eligible citizen of this coun-
try has the right to vote and have their 
vote counted. 
Cut to the chase, and that is what 
this about. 
Passing the Freedom to Vote Act and 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act would mean saying yes 
to basic, commonsense standards for 
free and fair elections; safeguarding 
our constitutional right to choose our 
own representatives; and going after 
dark money in our politics. 
Failing to pass these bills means we 
will continue to allow Republican 
State legislatures to undermine our de-
mocracy by suppressing some people’s 
access to their constitutional right to 
vote, based on who they are, where 
they live, and whether they are likely 
to vote Republican. 
Today on the Senate floor, not a sin-
gle Republican Senator is willing to 
join us Democrats in support of the 
Freedom to Vote Act and these com-
monsense standards for free and fair 
elections. This is a tragedy. 
I have been listening to their argu-
ments, and to be honest, they just 
don’t hold water. Republicans argue 
that the Freedom to Vote Act is a 
‘‘Federal takeover of elections,’’ or a 
power grab. This is ridiculous. 
The Freedom to Vote Act preserves 
States’ constitutional right to pre-
scribe the ‘‘times, places, and manner 
of holding elections,’’ while ensuring 
that elections must meet basic stand-
ards that allow Americans to exercise 
their right to vote and to have their 
votes counted, free from discrimina-
tion. 
Congress shares the constitutional 
responsibility for preserving our free 
and fair elections; article I, section 4, 
says that, ‘‘Congress may at any time 
by Law make or alter such Regula-
tions.’’ Furthermore, the 15th, 19th, 
and 26th Amendments require that we 
ensure that the right of our citizens to 
vote shall not be denied or abridged on 
account of race, color, sex, or age. 
These State laws that Republican 
legislatures are passing are clearly dis-
criminatory to young voters, Black 
and Latino voters, and Native voters. 
Countless studies have shown that 
these folks are more likely than White 
voters to be affected by voter purges, 
polling place closures, the restriction 
of early voting, and strict photo ID re-
quirements. This isn’t an accident or a 
coincidence. It is the point. 
Our job, our constitutional responsi-
bility, is to protect against discrimina-
tion just like this. Passing this bill 
isn’t Federal overreach; it is our job. 
Now, Republicans also argue that 
their 
voter 
suppression 
techniques 
aren’t actually oppressive or discrimi-
natory; they are designed to root out 
voter fraud. This is not only factually 
inaccurate—there is no evidence of 
widespread voter fraud—it is offensive. 
In Ohio, voters in Democratic-lean-
ing neighborhoods were purged from 
the voter rolls at twice the rate as in 
Republican neighborhoods. In Georgia, 
a 2018 voter roll purge removed over 
50,000 voters. Over 80 percent of them 
were people of color. Other States, like 
Texas, have instituted draconian voter 
ID laws that disproportionately burden 
Black and Latino voters. This is a real 
problem, not a fake problem. 
Colleagues, our voting laws reflect 
what we believe about who should have 
a voice in this country. They tell us 
who we are. 
When Republican State legislatures 
limit voting hours, close polling places 
in Black neighborhoods, and restrict 
early and absentee voting, they seek to 
silence some voices: young people, vot-
ers of color, and voters in poor neigh-
borhoods. When Republicans narrow 
the window when people can vote, they 
make it harder for some folks to exer-
cise their right to vote—people with 
multiple jobs or irregular schedules, 
people with childcare or transportation 
challenges, seniors, people with disabil-
ities, and anyone who can’t afford to 
wait in an hours-long line at their poll-
ing place. 
We cannot ignore—or pretend not to 
see—the line connecting these dis-
criminatory State laws and the dark 
history of Jim Crow, our country’s leg-
acy of denying some people, as my col-
league Reverend WARNOCK says, their 
constitutional rights. 
If we want to make more voices 
heard, we know what to do. My home 
State of Minnesota consistently has 
the highest voter turnout in the Na-
tion. This happens because we have 
strong voting laws that empower peo-
ple to make their voices heard while 
keeping our elections safe and secure. 
We have online and same-day voter 
registration, vote-by-mail and early 
voting, and voters have the right to 
take time off of work to vote in all 
State and Federal elections. We have 
paper ballots to ensure election integ-
rity. These policies work to expand bal-
lot access and improve voter turnout. 
The Freedom to Vote Act would imple-
ment many of them as minimum na-
tional standards. 
So why are Republicans united in 
their opposition to this bill? The sim-
plest answer is they believe they can’t 
win if more people’s voices are heard 
and counted. 
In Georgia in 2020, when Senate 
Democrats saw voters waiting up to 10 
hours to cast their votes and Black 
voters waiting much longer than White 
voters, we wrote a bill that would ex-
pand access to early voting, vote-by- 
mail, and make election day a Federal 
holiday. Republican State legislators 
in Georgia saw the same thing and 
passed a law to make it a crime to give 
food or water to voters waiting in line, 
remove drop boxes, and restrict voting 
by mail. For the past several years, Re-
publicans have engaged in a coordi-
nated strategy of voter suppression. 
According to the Brennan Center, in 
2021 alone, 19 States passed over 30 laws 
restricting voting rights. 
Today in the Senate, every single 
Democrat is united in our effort to pro-
tect people’s right to vote. And today, 
all 50 Republicans will block passage of 
this voting rights legislation. 
We may lose this battle today, which 
is heartbreaking. It is maddening that 
a majority of U.S. Senators, rep-
resenting 41 million more people than

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S337 
January 19, 2022 
our Republican colleagues, cannot pass 
a bill to make critical election reforms 
that are supported by strong majorities 
of Americans, all because of an arcane 
Senate rule. That is just not right, and 
it is long past time to fix it. In a de-
mocracy, after the debate is done, a 
majority of the people decide. That is 
how it works in township meetings, in 
city halls and county board meetings, 
in State legislatures, and that is how it 
should work in the U.S. Senate. 
But this fight won’t be over today. I 
have faith that, eventually, we will 
win. I have faith, not because I believe 
in the inevitability of progress, but be-
cause I have faith in the righteousness 
of this fight, and I have faith in our de-
mocracy. 
Dr. King taught us that progress is 
not a straight line. The story of change 
in this country, more often than not, is 
a story of people practicing their civic 
faith through defeat, people doing the 
work despite not having the votes, peo-
ple who keep putting one foot in front 
of the other because they believe they 
will reach their destination, even if 
they can’t quite see the path to get 
there. I am honored to walk that path 
with the thousands of organizers, ac-
tivists, and voters who share that civic 
faith. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
the Freedom to Vote Act and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
just for a minute, I want to first salute 
the amazing speeches by our two Sen-
ators from Georgia—Georgia, which 
has been the crucible in our fight for 
voting rights, where the attempts to 
curtail voting rights seem most per-
nicious. To both of you, your erudition, 
your eloquence, your passion were 
amazing. 
And I want to salute our Republican 
colleagues who listened to the speech-
es, and hope that those who weren’t 
here will get a chance to review those 
speeches as well. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Madam President, now, I ask unani-
mous consent that the mandatory 
quorum call with respect to the pend-
ing cloture motion be waived. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Without ob-
jection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the following Senators be 
permitted to complete their remarks 
prior to the scheduled vote: Senator 
BLUNT, Senator KLOBUCHAR, Senator 
SCHUMER. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Without ob-
jection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I 
have been on the floor most of the day 
today, and I think I heard virtually 
every speech given. I was reminded 
again, as the day went on, of really the 
broad-based talent of people in the 
Senate. 
I spent some time, a couple of years 
ago, over the course of about 6 months, 
kind of watching individual Senators 
and trying to figure out how they got 
here. And with only a couple of excep-
tions, I could figure it out: that unique 
ability to communicate or to explain 
things in a way that people understood 
them or to appear to just know more 
than other people knew about things 
that people knew Senators need to 
know about. And I was reminded again 
of the tragedy of how little we use that 
collective talent. 
There is absolutely no telling what 
we could do if we would decide, as 100 
people who figured out how to get to 
the U.S. Senate, how we would work 
together and solve big problems. 
And I think we all know where we are 
today. But I do hope, as Senator SCHU-
MER mentioned, that we listen to each 
other as people express different views. 
Certainly, the Senate would be a better 
place if we spent more time on the 
floor listening to each other and talk-
ing to each other. 
Now, on this bill, I think we all know 
where we are headed. In my view, hav-
ing watched election legislation for a 
long time, it seems to me this is just 
another version of an election bill in-
troduced by Democrats. There is not 
much new in this bill. Both the Rules 
Committee, where I serve, and the Sen-
ate have already rejected this Federal 
takeover of elections several times this 
year. 
Now, many of my friends on the 
other side said: Well, why wouldn’t Re-
publicans just want to debate this bill? 
I don’t think anybody said: Why 
wouldn’t the Republicans want to 
amend this bill—because there was no 
opportunity to do that. 
We have been on the bill now for sev-
eral days. We got on the bill. It was a 
fairly crafty way to get on the bill, 
with a 51-vote vote. It is fine with me 
to be on the bill. But our friends on the 
other side decided there would be no 
amendments on this bill. And I think 
Republicans, 
from 
the 
very 
start, 
sensed that this would be a bill where 
we would get a ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ vote on 
a bill that really would dramatically 
change how we pursue elections. 
Now, while it has a new name—it is 
more than 700 pages—it is nearly iden-
tical to the Freedom to Vote Act. It is 
substantially the same as the two 
versions that couldn’t get 50 on that 
side, S. 1; very similar to the Senate 
bill, H.R. 1; and very similar, frankly, 
to the election bills that I have been 
watching for 20 years. And there has al-
ways been a different reason to do 
about the same Democrat-sponsored 
bill in the House and Senate. After 
2020, the reason was, well, the equip-
ment is too faulty, and we have got to 
have more Federal control of what hap-
pens in the States. After 2016, the rea-
son to have a massive election bill was, 
well, there is just not enough security 
in State elections, and the Federal 
Government has to intervene in some 
major way. After 2020, even though the 
Federal Government didn’t intervene 
in a major way, suddenly the elections 
were the most secure in the history of 
the world. Both parties alleged that at 
one point. 
Now, we need to have this bill be-
cause some States are passing legisla-
tion that in most cases looks at the 
real outreach that they appropriately 
did for the pandemic, and thinking in 
2021 that the pandemic was over, think-
ing, what do we want to keep from 
what we did in that outreach, and what 
do we want to decide we should only do 
during a pandemic? 
I haven’t found very many places, if 
any, that couldn’t be easily explained, 
like 
postal 
regulations 
and 
other 
things, where the States have made 
changes and rolled back their pan-
demic outreach, where they don’t have 
more opportunities to vote now than 
they had in 2018, the last election be-
fore they should have done extraor-
dinary things. 
Actually, one lesson we probably 
taught State legislators here is, don’t 
do anything to try to amend an imme-
diate moment because if you try to 
undo it when that moment has passed, 
you 
will 
get 
on 
what 
Senator 
LANKFORD described as the ‘‘bad list.’’ 
He also did a pretty good job explain-
ing that a lot of States that weren’t on 
the bad list don’t have nearly the op-
portunities to vote as the States that 
are on the bad list. 
I was an election official for about 20 
years, including the secretary of state 
for a good part of that time, and I al-
ways thought that the diversity of the 
system was one of the strengths of the 
system. I thought, as President Obama 
did in 2016, that the diversity of the 
system made it really hard for out-
siders or insiders to figure out how 
they could rig a national election. I 
still think that. 
This bill undermines, really, a lot of 
State voter laws that are pretty pop-
ular with voters, and we have seen that 
expressed even in recent elections in 
like New York City. Prohibiting voter 
identification for mail-in ballots would 
be one of the things that you wouldn’t 
want to do. If you wanted to have mail- 
in ballots, you would want to be sure 
where those came from. Frankly, you 
would want to have an objective stand-
ard, like your voter ID number or some 
other number that was uniquely yours, 
rather than a subjective standard, like 
how you signed your name when you 
were 18 as opposed to how you are sign-
ing your name when you are 68. That 
was one of the changes, by the way, in 
the Georgia law, which should have 
helped more people than not. 
This bill retains S. 1’s mandate on 
ballot drop boxes and federalizes rules 
for redistricting. I think it chills free 
speech and requires felon voting. Now, 
why would anybody want to be against 
any of those things? There are reasons, 
frankly, to be against all of those 
things, but States make that decision 
for themselves, and in some States, it 
may work very well, and in others, it 
might not.

tration changes in this bill, the S. 1

policies in this bill disrupt State ef-
forts to maintain accurate voter rolls. 
Now, accurate voter rolls were seen as 
one of the great progressive moves for-
ward so you would have some sense 
that the people who voted on election 
day were actually people who were sup-
posed to vote, and it is also important 
to vote in that district. If you just vote 
anywhere, and your legislative district 
where you should have voted was de-
cided by four or five votes and you 
were one of those four or five, sud-
denly, that is a bit of a disservice to 
everybody else. 
The bill would send Federal money to 
campaign coffers at the rate of 6 Fed-
eral dollars for every dollar raised. It 
even goes so far as to add a second pub-
lic financing program that would give 
people $25 in Federal funds to con-
tribute to House candidates. Now, this 
6-to-1 match is only for House can-
didates. That may not be what the 
final bill would say if we passed this 
bill, but it is only for House candidates 
now. And, of course, this Federal 
money would be eligible to be matched 
by 6 to 1 other Federal dollars. That is 
a pretty good deal. You give somebody 
25 Federal dollars, and it could be 
matched with 6 to 1 other Federal dol-
lars. 
This bill sets up a framework that 
would result in, I think, every congres-
sional district map likely to be drawn 
by Federal courts. How many maps 
have we seen this time that were drawn 
by new improvements that the States 
made that didn’t turn out to be, one, 
any better than the old maps and, two, 
wound up being drawn by judges? 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Act— 
he was a friend of mine. I served with 
him. I traveled with him. I laughed 
with him. I liked him a lot. I admired 
him a lot. The Voting Rights Act was 
12 pages when it was introduced in 1965. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights provi-
sions here have a great name, but they 
are 120 pages. I voted to extend the 
Voting Rights Act, and I would do it 
again, and I would be proud to do it if 
it was named for John Lewis. But 735 
pages, and saying that if we don’t vote 
for that 735 pages, somehow we are op-
posed to the Voting Rights Act or op-
posed to the heroism of John Lewis? I 
don’t think so. 
Since it doesn’t have the support to 
pass under the current Senate rules, 
the next thing we will do is attempt to 
really gut the legislative filibuster to 
force it through. 
My Republican colleagues have spo-
ken at length about the consequences 
of doing that, as have Senator MANCHIN 
and Senator SINEMA just the other day. 
The justification rests on really a nar-
row basis that somehow the protection 
of the minority no longer matters. 
The danger of overturning 200 years 
of 
election 
administration 
by 
the 
States—I am going to resist doing any 
of the quotes this late in the day that 
you have heard over and over again of 
our Democratic friends who just a cou-
ple of years ago were saying—or less 
than a handful of years ago—how criti-
cally important it was that those rules 
never be changed. 
You know, if Democrats eliminate 
the 60-vote rule for election legislation, 
there will soon be no filibuster left. 
Today, it would be a carve-out for 
the election administration. Three or 
four weeks ago, it was a carve-out for 
raising the debt limit. The next carve- 
out would be for whatever seems to be 
important that day. 
The carve-out won’t work. I don’t 
think anybody here believes that any 
longer. This would be the first step in 
just eliminating an important distinc-
tion that makes the Senate a place 
where we have to think about what we 
do. It eliminates some of the chaos 
that occurs when you have a party 
change. 
In the past two decades, a single 
party has controlled both Chambers of 
the Congress and the Presidency four 
times, alternating between Democrats 
and Republicans. The Senate is what 
has kept the country from wildly going 
from one direction back to the other. 
We don’t want to lose that. It would be 
a disaster for our citizens, a disaster 
for our economy. Having that sense of 
having to think about this just a little 
bit before you head in another direc-
tion is what the Senate is all about. 
I certainly hope my colleagues today 
will not pass this Federal takeover of 
election laws and will also resist the 
temptation to change the rules of the 
Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Minnesota. 
Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR. 
Madam 
Vice 
President, I rise today after hearing 
from my friend Senator BLUNT. I re-
member on January 6, as all of you do 
that day, when he and I and Vice Presi-
dent Pence and two young women with 
the mahogany box filled with the last 
of the ballots—up to Wyoming—took 
that long walk through the shattered 
glass, the spray-painted statues, and 
we did our jobs. I will be forever grate-
ful for what he did that night and what 
so many people in this Chamber did. 
But, for me, it didn’t end that night 
because, sadly, what wasn’t accom-
plished 
by 
the 
people 
who 
rifled 
through these desks and got up on that 
dais, Madam Vice President; what 
wasn’t accomplished with bear spray; 
what wasn’t accomplished with the 
bayonets—and I still remember the 
blood on the officers’ faces—sadly has 
continued on. 
The votes that we took that night 
were important, but the votes that the 
people of this country take in every 
election are just as important. That is 
why, when you look at the Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act, you have to 
understand what it is grounded in, and 
that is our belief in our democracy. 
I want to thank every single Member 
of the Democratic caucus who has 
worked so hard to agree on this bill. I 
will say the voting rights groups, the 
Rules Committee—and I do differ from 
Senator BLUNT on this. We spent a lot 
of time making changes to that bill 
over the year. We have made many 
changes in response to concerns from 
secretaries of state and local election 
officials all across this country. 
I also thank the Vice President and 
the President for your leadership. 
Since this country’s founding when 
brave patriots rose up and ultimately 
established a country in the name of 
‘‘we the people,’’ America has been a 
shining beacon for the world, a touch-
stone for democracy. 
We travel the world as Senators, as 
Senators SHAHEEN and PORTMAN and I 
and several of our Democratic and Re-
publican colleagues did just this week-
end. When we went to decry dictators 
and bullies who attempt to undermine 
democracies, as Vladimir Putin is 
doing in Ukraine, we were proud on 
that trip to wear lapel pins with the 
Ukrainian flag on one side and the U.S. 
flag on the other. We are proud of our 
democracy, and that democracy is fun-
damentally based on the freedom to 
vote. 
Over the years, we made improve-
ments to address wrongs that kept too 
many Americans from joining in the 
rights on which our Nation was found-
ed. But for generation after generation, 
Americans have believed truly in our 
country’s 
founding 
promise. 
They 
fought for it, and they died for it. 
We are here today against that back-
drop of history, at a time when our de-
mocracy is facing a new wave of threat, 
a flood that has surged up since the 
2020 elections, when more Americans 
cast a ballot than ever before as a pan-
demic raged. It is up to us to turn back 
that tide and to preserve the right that 
lies at the bedrock of our system of 
government. 
Again, I disagree with Senator BLUNT 
about what has been going on. I look at 
the law that was passed in Montana 
that Senator TESTER described. That 
was set in place for 15 years for same- 
day registration in the State of Mon-
tana—15 years. In the last election, 
8,000 people took advantage of it on 
election day, either newly registering 
to vote or changing their address be-
cause they moved. It was just taken 
away from them with what one court 
described for another law years ago in 
North Carolina as ‘‘surgical precision.’’ 
You look at what our friends Senator 
OSSOFF and Senator WARNOCK have de-
scribed has happened in Georgia, where 
70,000 people registered during that last 
week of the election in the runoff pe-
riod—70,000 people in the last election. 
That has been stripped away, passed 
into law that that cannot happen 
again. 
The Founding Fathers knew that our 
democracy would face obstacles. A lot 
of people have been quoting them. I 
will quote this one from Samuel 
Adams. He said this: 
The liberties of our country . . . are worth 
defending [at] all hazards. And it is our duty 
to defend them against all attacks.

against Members of Congress in just

S339 
January 19, 2022 
the last year—double, triple what we 
have seen before—I don’t see that walk 
we took, that really important walk— 
that it all ended that day. When you 
have local election officials across this 
country 
being 
threatened 
and 
the 
names of their kids and their homes 
put out on the internet, like the Re-
publican local election official in Sen-
ator CASEY’s home State of Pennsyl-
vania—his house, his kids, with a 
threat that said: ‘‘Tell the Truth Or 
Your Three Kids Will Be Fatally 
Shot’’—it is on all of us to uphold and 
protect this democracy. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act meets the challenges before us by 
establishing basic Federal standards 
for 
our 
election, 
restoring 
and 
strengthening the Voting Rights Act, 
countering the power of secret money 
in our politics, and taking on new 
threats to our elections to ensure that 
every vote is properly counted. 
And, again, let me read from the Con-
stitution from article I, section 4. That 
clause empowers Congress to ‘‘make or 
alter’’ rules for Federal elections ‘‘at 
any time’’—at any time. 
As Senator KAINE noted, that is the 
only time that ‘‘any time’’ is used in 
the Constitution, ‘‘at any time.’’ 
The word ‘‘filibuster’’ isn’t in this 
document. The word ‘‘cloture’’ isn’t in 
this document. But it was anticipated 
that Congress could and should be in-
volved in Federal elections when nec-
essary. 
What brought us to the point today? 
We are here in the midst of a concerted 
effort to stop people from exercising 
the most fundamental right in our de-
mocracy. 
Because, 
as 
Reverend 
Warnock has put so well, ‘‘some people 
don’t want some people to vote.’’ 
We are here because the people of 
this country know what is going on. I 
am talking about a veteran in Georgia 
who didn’t have to stand in line to 
serve his country, but he had to—I met 
him myself. He had to stand in line 
hours and hours and hours in the hot 
Sun just to cast a ballot. 
We are here because of those voters 
in Wisconsin who stood in the rain, in 
homemade masks and garbage bags in 
the beginning of a pandemic, just to ex-
ercise their right to vote. We are here 
because of a voter in a wheelchair in 
Texas who traveled 3 hours on four 
buses just to vote; a woman in Mon-
tana who had open-heart surgery, un-
certain about how to return her mail 
ballot; a former election official from a 
rural county was ousted by Repub-
licans in the Georgia Legislature after 
a decade of service; and a 92-year-old 
woman who was purged from the rolls 
after voting in every election for dec-
ades, since 1968. 
We are here because after a record 
number of voters voted to make their 
voices heard, there are people, sadly, 
who are working in every State capitol 
to make sure it never happens again. 
And I note that for every one of these 
laws that have passed in 19 different 
States, it has been with a simple ma-
jority, State by State by State—a sim-
ple majority. 
And then, as was noted by several of 
my colleagues, after this Chamber has 
established over 160 carve-outs, 160 
processes in law to allow for a final 
vote without a 60-vote threshold— 
whether it is for the debt ceiling, 
whether it is for the Bush tax cuts, 
whether it is for the Trump tax cuts, 
whether it is for Justice Amy Coney 
Barrett—51 votes—now we hear, at this 
very moment, that we must embrace 
this archaic rule that is not in the Con-
stitution and did not exist when the 
Senate was founded. 
And we are not even talking about 
getting rid of this rule. We are simply 
talking about restoring the Senate to 
what it once was so we can have de-
bates, and we can actually vote on bills 
when those debates have concluded and 
when the speeches are exhausted. 
We are here because we took an oath 
to defend the Constitution as we did 
that night on January 6. We are here 
because we know that the eyes of the 
world are on us, watching to see if 
America will stand up and take on the 
challenges of our time. 
To paraphrase Dr. King, whose legacy 
has been honored many, many times 
today, while there may be finite dis-
appointment in this country for so 
many people every day, we must never 
lose infinite hope. 
We are not losing it. That, my 
friends, is why we on the Democratic 
side of the aisle are supporting this 
bill. With history’s eyes on us and with 
so much at stake, we must and we will 
fight on. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam Vice Presi-
dent, what kind of democracy shall en-
dure here in the United States long 
after our times in this Chamber come 
to an end? Shall American democracy 
in the 21st century be called a true heir 
to our Framers’ vision—a nation where 
the people choose their own leaders, 
forge their own destiny, and add to the 
great legacies of those who expanded 
the franchise before us or shall we see 
American democracy backslide in our 
time, grow feeble in the jaws of its ad-
versaries, and ultimately succumb to 
the cancer of voter suppression? 
The answer, in a large sense, could 
depend on how we move forward this 
evening. As we have clearly laid out in 
over the past 2 days, the laws passed in 
legislatures throughout the country do 
nothing less than to discourage and 
prevent certain kinds of Americans— 
Black and Brown Americans, young 
Americans, elderly Americans, low-in-
come Americans—from participating in 
the democratic process. 
My colleagues, my colleagues, we can 
begin to put a stop to these attacks to-
night by voting to proceed to the final 
passage of the Freedom to Vote Act 
and the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. These are good bills; 
these are effective bills; and they 
should be passed by this Chamber as 
soon as possible. 
And if cloture is not invoked, we 
must change the rules of the Senate so 
we can pass these bills into law. As we 
cast our votes, I urge every one of us, 
Democrat and Republican, not to dis-
count our place in history. The story of 
American democracy is full of con-
tradictions and halting progress. 
At the time of our Constitution’s 
ratification, you had to be in many 
States a White, male, Protestant land-
owner to vote. But ever since the early 
days of this grand Republic, Americans 
launched mighty movements, fought a 
bloody civil war, and, yes, passed Fed-
eral election laws to expand the fran-
chise until there were no more bound-
aries. 
Today’s vote is the next step in that 
long march. Are we going to let our de-
mocracy backslide in the 21st century? 
Are we going to be dragged back into 
the abyss of voter suppression? 
I urge every one of my colleagues, 
left, right, and middle, for the sake of 
our democracy, unite, take a stand 
today. 
To every Member of this body who 
treasures our precious experiment in 
self-rule, to every Member horrified by 
the muck of voter suppression, and to 
everyone who believes this Chamber is 
still capable of defending democracy in 
its hour of great need, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. 
I yield the floor. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Pursuant to 
rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion, 
which the clerk will state. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION

ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby

and Space Administration to enter into 
leases of non-excess property of the Adminis-
tration.

MOTION TO RECONSIDER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam Vice Presi-
dent, I enter a motion to reconsider the 
failed cloture vote. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion 
is entered. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
(Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.) 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, as we 
head toward the final hour of debate, I 
want to just bring us back about 20 feet 
to talk about the stakes that we are la-
boring under tonight. 
I want to talk a little bit about the 
big picture of why this matters. 
I know we have changed the rules 160 
times in the history of the Senate, but 
I will submit that it is still an extraor-
dinary endeavor to ask our colleagues 
to change the rules and traditions of 
this body. 
And so here is what I want to say: It 
is really important to remember that 
democracy, this idea that every mem-
ber of our country, every member of 
the community gets an equal say in 
the rules that govern us, it is unnatu-
ral. 
Why do I know this? Because I want 
you to think of every organization in 
your life that matters. Your work-
place; it doesn’t give equal votes to 
every employee as to the direction of 
the company. Think about your favor-
ite sports team. There is not a vote 
from all the players about the lineups 
or the strategy of the team. The Sun-
day sermon at your church isn’t chosen 
by an online poll of the congregation. 
I love my kids, but they don’t get an 
equal say with me and my wife about 
the rules of our house. 
When you look out over the long 
stretch of human history, it is no won-
der that 99.9 percent of humans have 
lived under governments that were 
monarchies or sultanates or autoc-
racies. 
Since the beginning of time, human 
beings have preferred, have been natu-
rally drawn to or maybe have been 
trapped in hierarchal systems where 
the strong and the powerful make the 
decisions for everyone else. 
The idea that humans, both the weak 
and the powerful, the rich and the 
poor, should decide together, each per-
son having equal weight, the course of 
their 
Nation—this 
idea 
is 
revolu-
tionary. 
There have been experiments over 
the course of world history, but no na-
tion has sustained this idea longer 
than this one. In historical context, 
our democracy should be perceived as a 
tiny, fragile port in the middle of a 
raging storm, and none of us should be 
surprised that once in a while some 
Americans, drawn to the old system of 
control by the strong and powerful, de-
cide that it is time to give up and sub-
mit to the battering winds. 
That is the moment we are in today. 
Just in the last few days, former Presi-
dent Donald Trump, the leader of the 
Republican Party and their likely can-
didate for President in 2024, once again, 
made clear his intent. 
He said last week: 
We have to be a lot sharper the next time 
when it comes to counting the votes. . . . 
Sometimes the vote counter is more impor-
tant than the candidate. 
The leader of the Republican Party 
isn’t even trying to hide his agenda 
any longer. State after State is chang-
ing the rules of who counts the votes so 
that only the allies of Donald Trump 
can decide which votes count and 
which votes don’t. 
Now, much of the focus today, under-
standably, has been on the unconscion-
able rules that limit the ability of poor 
people or people of color to vote, and it 
is heinous that Black voters have to 
wait in lines that are two times or ten 
times longer than a White voter. But 
democracy may actually collapse when 
Trump’s plan to rig the next count suc-
ceeds in plain view for everybody to 
see. He broadcasts that in the next 
election the vote counting will be more 
important than the quality of the can-
didates. 
Why? Because the plan is to install 
Donald Trump as President, whether or 
not he actually wins the election, just 
like he tried to do after the 2020 elec-
tion. 
Can anybody really deny that this is 
the agenda? 
Of course, that is what he is doing, 
because it is what he tried to do trans-
parently, unapologetically in 2020, and 
that is what he is telling us he is going 
to do in 2024. At some point, we just 
have to believe what we see and what 
we hear. 
And I appreciate Senator THUNE com-
ing to the floor earlier today and tell-
ing us that he believed Joe Biden won 
the election and that when he faced a 
close election, he submitted to the will 
of the voters. But Senator THUNE is not 
the mainstream of the Republican 
Party today. In fact, those that believe 
Joe Biden won the election in the Re-
publican Party are the dead limbs of an 
otherwise perfectly healthy tree. The 
trunk of that tree is Donald Trump and 
MARJORIE
TAYLOR
GREENE
and all 
those who believe that Joe Biden is an 
illegitimate President. That is what 70 
percent of Republicans believe today. 
If mainstream Republicans in this 
body came to Connecticut and held a 
rally, a dozen people would show up. 
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE came to my 
State and 3,000 Republicans came— 
more than I have ever seen show up for 
a Republican, because that is the main-
stream of the Republican Party. 
Today, we are voting on a proposal to 
change our rules so that we can protect 
our democracy and the rules that have 
stood for generations to assure that 
both parties continue to have a role in 
counting the votes. And while it feels 
astonishing that not a single Repub-
lican is going to join us today—not the 
Trump cheerleaders nor the sometimes 
critics of the former President—maybe 
it shouldn’t be that shocking, because 
of that natural state that billions of 
humans have defaulted to over the mil-
lennium, the unelected rich and power-
ful being in charge of everything and 
setting the rules for everyone else. 
It might square perfectly with Re-
publicans’ agenda. For the last decade, 
the entire legislative agenda here, 
when Republicans have been in charge, 
has been about giving more power, 
more money, more influence to the 
rich and powerful. They oppose Presi-
dent Biden’s agenda to give tax breaks 
to the poor and the middle class or to 
cut profits for the drug companies, be-
cause it empowers that agenda, often 
the weak and the powerless. 
Maybe Republicans aren’t fighting to 
protect democracy like Democrats are 
because a reversion to a world where 
just the rich and powerful run the 
country just isn’t as scary to that side 
of this body as it is to this side. 
I wish it weren’t up to us. I wish it 
didn’t have to come to this. I wish it 
was not only Democrats that see the 
miracle of our fragile democracy, be-
cause the idea that a worker making 
$12 an hour has just as much say in the 
future of their country as the CEO 
making $12 million a year, it is revolu-
tionary. It is unnatural. And it matters 
more than anything, even the tradi-
tions and the rules of the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who 
seeks recognition? 
The Senator from Maine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S341 
January 19, 2022 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I came here 
9 years ago opposed to modifying the 
rules of the filibuster. Indeed, I signed 
a letter a couple of years ago saying 
the same thing. I understand that it 
can and probably will boomerang, that 
an elimination of the filibuster—what 
is today’s annoying obstruction could 
be tomorrow’s priceless shield. I get 
that. 
I understand that it can also be a 
spur to bipartisanship. We all saw that 
several years ago in the CARES Act. 
The Republican leader submitted a bill. 
It was voted down on a filibuster ini-
tially, and then there ensued a series of 
negotiations that improved the bill and 
made it a bipartisan bill that passed 
this body unanimously. 
The problem is, if it is being used as 
a spur to bipartisan discussions, that 
works. We saw it work with the CARES 
Act. But if it is used simply to stop 
something, in other words, if one side 
or the other just doesn’t even want to 
talk about the subject, what you are 
talking about is stone cold obstruction, 
and that is where we are today. 
Unfortunately, part of this body just 
doesn’t want to talk about the issue of 
voting rights. How do I know that? Be-
cause we brought up a motion to pro-
ceed three times, and it was voted 
down three times—a motion to proceed 
to have a discussion about this issue. 
The only reason we are having this de-
bate today is that the majority leader 
found a rule that, frankly, I never 
heard of that enabled us to bring this 
to the floor. It wasn’t because the 
other side said: Oh, let’s discuss voting 
rights. 
What we have now is not a filibuster. 
It is a second cousin once removed of a 
filibuster. It doesn’t require any effort. 
It doesn’t require any speeches. It 
doesn’t require to hold the floor. All it 
is is a dial-in, no-work filibuster. 
Strom Thurmond would have loved this 
filibuster. He wouldn’t have had to 
stand here for 24 hours. And I venture 
to say that if we had the rules that we 
have today, we wouldn’t have the Vot-
ing Rights Act and the Civil Rights 
Act, because it was too easy to stop 
anything. 
That is the problem. We don’t really 
have a filibuster. The real radical 
change in the filibuster rule was in 
1975, when they wanted to go from two- 
thirds of those present voting to 60 
votes, but, inadvertently, we created 
the no-effort filibuster, and that is 
what we have now. 
I would submit that a talking fili-
buster, which is what we are going to 
be proposing in a few minutes, would 
be the real spur to bipartisanship be-
cause everybody would want to get it 
over with. The minority would want to 
get it over with, and the majority 
would want to get it over with, and get 
to a point where there would be discus-
sion. And I believe, listening to the de-
bate today, based upon the discussion 
today, that I think there may be some 
areas where we can find agreement. 
The real spur to bipartisanship would 
be to return to the old filibuster. This 
is what we are going to be voting on 
today. 
And, by the way, on bipartisanship, I 
came here to seek bipartisanship. I am 
all about bipartisanship. But it strikes 
me as one of the deep ironies of this 
discussion that we are elevating bipar-
tisanship in this body to this exalted 
position while these laws are being 
passed entirely on a partisan basis in 
all these States across the country. I 
guess bipartisanship is an important 
principle in Washington, but in Atlanta 
and Austin, not so much. I don’t get 
that. I think that is one of the real iro-
nies of this situation. 
So, ANGUS, if you came here opposed 
9 years ago, why are you changing 
now? Because what we are talking 
about today isn’t policy; it is struc-
ture. It is our democracy itself. 
Policy can change. If they don’t like 
the policy we pass, they can kick us 
out and vote other people in. If we 
change the structure that diminishes 
the right of people to vote, it is not 
self-correcting anymore. The system 
itself is being compromised. That is 
what we have to talk about. 
And we are not only talking. All of 
the discussion or most of the discus-
sion today has been about voter sup-
pression. There is also what I call voter 
subversion—purging the officials in 
charge of elections. 
This democracy, I would argue, was 
damn near saved by a guy named Brad 
Raffensperger in Georgia. They purged 
him—or they are going to. They have 
already purged him out of the system, 
and they are going to try to purge him 
out of his job. That is happening. And 
we talk about giving people in the leg-
islature—a 
partisan 
legislature—the 
ability to dismiss voting boards be-
cause they don’t like what they did? 
We are going to see more and more vot-
ing boards, voting commissioners, cer-
tification officials being purged be-
cause they don’t want to get the re-
sults that they don’t agree with. 
The other problem here that really 
worries me about our democracy is 
that the former President’s efforts to 
undermine confidence in our elections 
have already convinced two-thirds of 
one of our great political parties that 
the elections were illegitimate and 
were rigged. Two-thirds of one of our 
great political parties now believes 
that. 
If these laws that are happening 
across the country—and they are going 
to continue happening. By the way, if 
we give them a pass today, it is Katy, 
bar the door, over the next 6 months. 
Then you are going to disillusion and 
anger and loss of trust among two- 
thirds of the Democratic Party and 
Independents, and you are going to 
have widespread distrust of elections as 
the way we solve our problems in this 
country. And if you can’t trust elec-
tions, what do you do? 
I would submit that we saw it on 
January 6. Those people had been told 
that something was stolen from them, 
and they couldn’t trust elections. They 
couldn’t 
trust 
the 
courts. 
They 
couldn’t trust the media. So they took 
the law into their own hands. And, 
sadly, if this continues, we will have a 
broad widespread loss of trust in our 
electoral process, and that is when de-
mocracy starts to fall apart. 
Finally—my wife says I say ‘‘finally’’ 
too much and it gets people’s hopes up. 
Finally, there are some deeper con-
stitutional issues here. The Framers 
knew fractions. They said it takes two- 
thirds to pass a treaty. It takes two- 
thirds to impeach a President. It takes 
two-thirds to pass a constitutional 
amendment. It takes three-quarters of 
the States to pass a constitutional 
amendment. 
They 
knew 
fractions. 
They didn’t apply any fractions when 
they talked about the passage of legis-
lation. Why not? Because they knew it 
would be a disaster to have a super-
majority requirement in one of the 
Houses of the national legislature. 
How do I know that? Because Madi-
son and Hamilton said it explicitly in 
Federalist 22 by Hamilton, Federalist 
58 by Madison. Madison said: 
The fundamental principle of free govern-
ment [if you have a supermajority require-
ment] would be reversed. It would be no 
longer the majority that would rule: the 
power would be transferred to the minority. 
You can’t have it both ways. It is ei-
ther majority rule or its minority rule, 
and the filibuster was not part of the 
Constitution. In fact, they expressly 
and explicitly rejected that idea of a 
supermajority requirement. It flips de-
mocracy on its head. 
I think we are at a hinge of history, 
Mr. President. I think we are at a 
hinge of history where our fragile ex-
periment—and 
Senator 
MURPHY
is 
right, we are an anomaly in world his-
tory. The norm is pharaohs and Kings 
and dictators, and now we call them 
Presidents for life. 
And once people seize power, look at 
what—and this isn’t an academic dis-
cussion. This has happened in Hungary, 
in Turkey, and Venezuela—in Russia. 
It has happened right in our personal 
experiences. It can happen here, and it 
starts with undermining free and fair 
elections. 
In the winter of 1891, the House 
passed a protection act for Black vot-
ers in the South. The bill was to deal 
with the egregious voter suppression 
that was then sweeping the South in 
the wake of the Civil War. The bill 
came here and died due to a filibuster. 
That filibuster echoed in this country 
for 75 years. It took 75 years to correct 
the mistake that this body made with 
that filibuster in the winter of 1891. 
We are not talking about abolishing 
the filibuster. We are not talking about 
a carve-out. We are talking about al-
lowing this body—requiring this body— 
to debate, to argue, to make their ar-
guments as long as it takes, and then, 
at the end, when the debate is ex-
hausted, when all of us have had the 
opportunity to speak twice, then we 
have a vote, and we pass legislation on 
the same basis that it has always been

passed—by a majority. Cloture has 
nothing to do with the passage of legis-
lation. It has always been by a major-
ity. 
I pray that we don’t look back on 
this day and realize the level of the 
mistake that they made in 1891. 
Abraham Lincoln’s words ring today 
as they did when he came to this body 
in December of 1862. 
He said: 
Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. 
We of this Congress and this administration, 
will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No 
personal significance, or insignificance, can 
spare one another of us. The fiery trial 
through which we pass, will light us down, in 
honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. 
‘‘The fiery trial through which we 
pass, will light us down, in honor or 
dishonor, to the latest generation.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am glad 
that a number of my Republican col-
leagues are in the Chamber because I 
am going to speak very briefly just to 
reassure you that I am not so immod-
est that I believe I am going to per-
suade you, but I do want to try to reas-
sure you. 
We are going to take up a rules re-
form proposal that will not blow up the 
Senate. We are going to take up a rules 
reform proposal that will not abolish 
the filibuster, that will not weaken the 
filibuster. We are going to take up a 
proposal that will show you, even if 
you are not persuaded, that we have 
been listening to you, that we have 
been listening to all of our colleagues, 
as we try to come up with a rules re-
form proposal to let us address the vot-
ing rights issue. 
I am glad to see Senator COLLINS and 
Senator COONS here on the floor. They 
helped put together the 2017 letter that 
many of us signed. It is very carefully 
worded, and it is two paragraphs. What 
they got us to join together as bipar-
tisan Senators to express was our 
united determination to preserve the 
ability of Members to engage in ex-
tended debate when bills are on the 
Senate floor—extended debate when 
bills are on the Senate floor—and that 
is what our rules reform proposal will 
do. 
The simplest way to understand it— 
and Senator MERKLEY is going to go 
into more detail—is that it switches 
the current secret filibuster into a pub-
lic filibuster and makes both parties 
have to work on the floor. The major-
ity has to work and the minority has 
to work on the floor to get the kind of 
extended public debate that we joined 
together to seek in the letter in 2017. 
Let’s face it. We don’t really do this. 
The current rules are an obstacle to ex-
tended debate because you just vote 
down the motion to proceed, and you 
can’t even get on a bill. Then, if you do 
get on a bill, the 60-vote cloture 
threshold is used, with confidence, by a 
filibustering minority. You don’t even 
have to show up to debate because 
there is an awareness that you can’t 
get 60 votes to terminate debate. So, 
instead of trying to change the rule 
about terminating debate—which, as 
my colleague Senator MANCHIN pointed 
out, to terminate debate has always re-
quired more than a simple majority— 
we are going to restore actually having 
debate, and when debate is finished, 
the rules of this Senate have always 
been, when debate is finished, even 
after a long time, passage is by a sim-
ple majority. 
Our proposal is to restore a talking 
filibuster, which has been the history 
of this Senate over the vast majority of 
our history, and to make a simple 
change to make it public rather than 
secret so that our colleagues and the 
American public can understand and 
then hold us accountable for our ac-
tions. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, 
let me say that I appreciate the sin-
cerity of the Senator from Virginia— 
my friend Senator KAINE—and his com-
ments about the filibuster. I am not 
going to repeat the speech that I gave 
last week on the vital safeguards that 
the filibuster provides to the minority 
party in the U.S. Senate and why it 
makes us the greatest deliberative 
body in the world. 
Instead, since I have already talked 
on that issue, I feel compelled to re-
spond to comments that were made by 
Senator OSSOFF, the Senator from 
Georgia, earlier this evening, in which 
he singled out four Republican Sen-
ators—Senator 
MCCONNELL, 
Senator 
CORNYN, Senator BURR, and myself— 
and our position on the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965, a seminal law that was so 
important in the civil rights movement 
in guaranteeing the right to vote for 
all Americans. 
Well, I was not in the Senate in 1965. 
I was 13. I am not sure that the Senator 
from Georgia was even born in 1965, but 
that is not really my point. 
My point is that, of me, the Senator 
from Georgia, Mr. OSSOFF, said: Sen-
ator COLLINS previously said that this 
bill will ensure that voting rights af-
forded to all Americans are protected 
but not anymore. 
I voted, enthusiastically, and did say 
that about the Voting Rights Act reau-
thorization in 2006. Surely, my col-
league is not confusing that bill, which 
was 5 pages long—5 pages—with the bill 
that is before the Senate tonight, 
which is 735-pages long. Surely, he is 
not confusing those two bills. If he is, 
I would like to sit down and talk with 
him about the enormous differences be-
tween the two bills, but, frankly, the 
number of pages says it all. 
I do support the reauthorization of 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and I did 
so, as did every other Senator, in 2006, 
but to equate that to the legislation 
that is before us now is simply not wor-
thy. Had I been on the floor at that 
time, I might well have thought of re-
minding the Senator that we have a 
rule in the Senate, rule XIX, which 
prohibits the impunity, the integrity, 
or the motives of other Senators—and 
not just one Senator in this case but 
four Senators. 
So let there be no mistake about it, 
I do support the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. I supported the Voting Rights Act 
of 2006, as did every one of my col-
leagues who was mentioned by Senator 
OSSOFF this evening, and I think it is 
sad that he implied otherwise about 
our support for such important civil 
rights legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, briefly, 
in responding to the comments from 
Senator COLLINS from Maine—a Sen-
ator for whom I have great respect and 
whose reputation for bipartisanship, 
for substance, and for a thoughtful 
statespersonlike 
and 
patriotic 
ap-
proach to legislation precedes her— 
what I was referring to, Senator COL-
LINS, was the legislation that the Sen-
ate took up earlier this year, which, in 
response to the Supreme Court’s invi-
tation to Congress after the Shelby 
County v. Holder decision, would have 
updated the preclearance formulas that 
govern section 4 and section 5 of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 such that the 
Department of Justice could continue 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
vital 
work 
of 
preclearing changes to voting proce-
dures in States and jurisdictions that 
exhibit a history or a pattern of voter 
suppression. 
That is an obligation that I believe 
this Congress has. The Supreme Court, 
in fact, invited us to carry out that ob-
ligation, and the Committee on the Ju-
diciary, under Senator DURBIN’s leader-
ship, carefully crafted legislation that 
we believed responded to the Supreme 
Court’s invitation to do just that. 
Respectfully, Senator COLLINS, in 
representing the State of Georgia, 
where, as I mentioned earlier, we faced 
a wave of bills and now law, which ev-
erybody in my State knows are in-
tended deliberately and to dispropor-
tionately 
impact 
certain 
commu-
nities—laws that prior to the Shelby 
County decision would have been sub-
jected 
to 
Department 
of 
Justice 
preclearance—I believe more strongly 
than ever that preclearance is nec-
essary. 
What I was respectfully noting, Sen-
ator COLLINS, without any implications 
with respect to your motives or integ-
rity, was what I believed to be an in-
consistency, an inconsistency between 
voting consistently to reauthorize the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 and lauding 
it as a signature civil rights achieve-
ment, but then voting not even to 
allow debate in this body on the legis-
lation that was created to respond to 
the Supreme Court’s invitation to up-
hold its preclearance provision. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Maine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S343 
January 19, 2022 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me 
just note that the Federal Department 
of Justice, under section 2 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act, has challenged the law 
of the State of Georgia and the State of 
Texas. So the idea that somehow the 
Justice Department no longer has au-
thority to challenge laws with which it 
disagrees or regulations or practices is 
simply not accurate. Section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act provides that au-
thority. It is in effect, and the Depart-
ment of Justice, rightly or wrongly, 
has invoked it. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, I know 
we have other business to attend to 
and an important debate on a proce-
dure that is ongoing, but I want to 
note, with respect to my colleague 
from Maine, that section 2 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act is not the entirety of 
the Voting Rights Act. 
Section 4 and section 5, which pro-
vide for the preclearance of changes to 
voting laws in jurisdictions with a his-
tory or a pattern of voter suppression, 
are vital precisely because the post- 
facto litigation that the DOJ must em-
bark upon to challenge State policies, 
once they have already been enacted, 
can be far too time-consuming to allow 
for a remedy to emerge in the courts. 
This is precisely why section 4 and sec-
tion 5 were enacted at the time—to 
give the Department of Justice the 
power 
it 
needs 
to 
preclear 
these 
changes in places with a history of seg-
regation and voter suppression. In my 
State, despite all of the protestations 
to the contrary, we are, right now, wit-
nessing a significant wave of voter sup-
pression policies. 
The Department of Justice should 
have the authority to preclear those 
changes to law to ensure they don’t 
disproportionately 
impact 
minority 
communities. 
So section 2 of the Voting Rights Act 
is important, but if section 4 and sec-
tion 5 were also vital when we voted to 
reauthorize them in 2006, why aren’t 
they vital today? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I prom-
ise my colleagues this will be my last 
comment. 
This is entirely different from the de-
bate on a 735-page bill. I would invite 
my colleague from Georgia to review 
exactly what he said earlier this 
evening. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I com-
pliment my colleagues from Maine and 
Georgia for engaging in perhaps the 
most substantive exchange I have ever 
witnessed in 13 years here in the Sen-
ate. 
(Applause.) 
Earlier this evening, one of my col-
leagues from across the aisle said: Why 
are we going down this road? And there 
have been similar questions: Why is 
this so important? Why is this bill so 
important? 
I will answer simply this: that dark 
money corrupts elections. If you and I 
donate more than $200 to a campaign, 
we record it, but if extraordinarily 
wealthy individuals donate hundreds of 
millions of dollars, they can do it with 
no attribution, corrupting the elec-
tions across this country. 
Gerrymandering corrupts the system 
of equal representation. From the ear-
liest debates in this Chamber, it was 
recognized that each of us has a stake 
in the integrity of the elections in 
other States so that the people of the 
United States experience equal rep-
resentation. We do not have equal rep-
resentation in the House today, and 
the gerrymandering going on now will 
increase that corruption. 
Third and most importantly, the 
power to vote is the most significant 
right, guaranteeing each citizen a voice 
in the direction of our democracy. It is 
the soul of what it means to be a demo-
cratic republic. That power to vote is 
also the most important check in our 
system of checks and balances. 
With rigged elections, leaders leaning 
toward autocracy can keep themselves 
in power, but with fair elections, 
undergirded by a free press, the people 
can vote out those autocratic leaders 
who ignore laws and undermine our in-
stitutions. It is the most important 
check in maintaining the integrity of 
our beloved Republic. 
Let’s go back in time. The rules of 
the Senate were forged in the Confed-
eration 
Congress 
experience. 
Our 
Founders were engaged, during the 
time they were writing our Constitu-
tion, in participating in the Confed-
eration Congress that required a vote 
of 9 out of 13—two-thirds plus a bit—in 
order to pass any law. It prevented 
them from being able to pay the pen-
sions of our veterans, and it prevented 
them from raising money for Shays’ 
Rebellion. 
Our Founders who participated in 
that process said: This supermajority 
has paralyzed our ability to act. With 
that in mind, they wrote our Constitu-
tion so that legislation would be passed 
by a simple majority; that at the end 
of the debate, when all perspectives 
were duly considered, the perspective 
favored by the larger number would be 
accepted rather than the perspective 
favored by the smaller number. 
So our Founders, leaving nothing to 
chance, warned us in their writings: 
Never adopt a supermajority. 
They said—and I will quote James 
Madison—that when ‘‘the general good 
might require new laws . . . the prin-
ciple of free government would be re-
versed. It would be no longer the ma-
jority that would rule: [It would be] 
the power transferred to the minor-
ity.’’ He went on to say the result 
would be ‘‘particular emergencies, to 
extort unreasonable indulgences.’’ 
Hamilton said many similar things. 
‘‘If a pertinacious minority can control 
the opinion of the majority,’’ the result 
will be ‘‘tedious delays; continual nego-
tiation and intrigue; contemptible . . . 
compromises.’’ 
He 
noted 
that 
the 
‘‘[supermajority’s] real operation is to 
embarrass the administration, to de-
stroy the energy of the government.’’ 
Anyone who has seen the energy 
drained out of this Chamber by nothing 
happening day after day after day when 
we have important issues to face can 
understand just how right the Found-
ers were. 
So in writing up the guidelines and 
the vision for the initial Senate, our 
leaders came up with a Senate code, 
and that Senate code was, hear all per-
spectives—in fact, guaranteeing in rule 
IV of the original rules that every Sen-
ator would have the right to speak 
twice to a question. 
In addition, they put into the rules a 
previous question just in case they 
couldn’t get the debate to wrap up so 
they could get to that all-important 
vote to determine where the greater 
number stood. 
Thomas Jefferson put into the rule 
book, the manual for the rules in 1801: 
‘‘No one is to speak impertinently or 
beside the question, superfluously or 
tediously.’’ 
Hear the debate, consider all perspec-
tives, and take the option the greater 
number favored. 
That Senate code endured in a power-
ful fashion for a very long time. In 1806, 
Aaron Burr was rewriting the rules, 
and he said: You know, we have never 
needed to use the previous question 
rule in the book because we hear every 
one, we hear those perspectives, we 
take a vote, and we go forward. So we 
don’t need the previous question. And 
it was dropped from the rule book. 
When I hear the folks say the Senate 
never had a simple majority to close 
debate—they had the Senate code, and 
they had a rule, and then they said: We 
don’t need the rule because we have the 
Senate code. 
That code continued to endure, and 
the full understanding of the Members 
of this Chamber was they had no right 
to prevent the Senate from getting to a 
final vote. 
That code was so powerful that in the 
mid-1800s, when Senators started to 
speak at length in order to make it 
very difficult to get to a final vote, the 
press called it piracy. 
You may wonder, where did the term 
‘‘filibuster’’ come from? That term is a 
corruption of the term ‘‘freebooter,’’ 
the term for ‘‘piracy.’’ The piracy was 
Senators breaking the Senate code. 
That was the piracy. But, still, it hap-
pened on rare occasion, and the code 
was stretched but not really broken 
through the 1800s, except on civil 
rights. 
What happened in our history on 
civil rights? Well, you had John C. Cal-
houn leading the nullification move-
ment that said: Hey, States don’t have 
to accept any given Federal law. They 
can choose and pick which ones they 
want.

Initially, that nullification move-
ment was in order to block laws that 
put tariffs on imported products that 
strengthened the North and cost more 
funds to the South, increased the 
prices of goods, but then it turned to 
the question of protecting slavery. Nul-
lification continued and even went so 
far as to say States should have the 
right to secede if they don’t like those 
Federal laws. Then we had a civil war 
over that question, and that was the 
end of nullification, but it was not the 
end of attacks on civil rights. 
So what did we see after the Civil 
War? We saw a group of States make it 
harder for individuals to register to 
vote. We saw a group of States make it 
hard for Black Americans to get public 
accommodations. We saw a group of 
States make it easier to reenslave 
Black Americans under the Black code, 
utilizing the slavery clause of the 13th 
Amendment. 
Congress responded, the House re-
sponded, this Senate responded and 
said: No. We are here to defend the 
Constitution, that every person is cre-
ated equal, and every person’s rights 
must be protected. 
That is what this Chamber, the Sen-
ate, did in 1875. 
The House passed the Civil Rights 
Act on public accommodations, guar-
anteeing access to all public accom-
modations 
for 
all 
Americans. 
The 
House voted 152 to 99. It came to the 
Senate, and the Senate voted 38 to 26, 
a simple majority. 
Although there were Senators here 
who desperately hated public accom-
modation bills because it would end 
discrimination in the South, they did 
not filibuster because the Senate code 
said that after all views are heard, you 
can hold a simple majority vote. 
The Senate code held, but it didn’t 
hold in 1891. In 1890, Henry Cabot 
Lodge, down the hall in the House, in-
troduced what became known as the 
Lodge bill. It said: In order to protect 
the foundation of our Nation, there can 
be Federal supervision upon request to 
make sure registration is fair, to make 
sure the voting process is fair, and to 
make sure the counting process is fair. 
The bill came here to the Senate, and 
a bipartisan group filibustered that 
bill, southern Democrats and western 
Senators known as the Silver Senators. 
They were anxious to get onto a bill 
about silver coinage to support the sil-
ver mining in the West. That bill was 
eventually tabled. 
In 1891, the Senate code was broken 
on civil rights and continued to be bro-
ken through 1965. In 1922, the Dyer 
Anti-Lynching Act was filibustered. In 
1934, the Costigan-Wagner anti-lynch-
ing act was filibustered. In 1942, the 
anti-poll tax bill that put a price on 
being able to access the ballot box—it 
was filibustered. And on and on. 
With the exception of a 1-week delay 
in a bill for arming commercial ships 
in 1917, virtually every filibuster de-
nied Black Americans the right to vote 
because in lieu of nullification, there 
had to be a strategy for certain Sen-
ators to make sure that Black Ameri-
cans didn’t get their civil rights. That 
is the sorry chapter of that part of our 
American history. Three generations 
through it, 1965 paid the price of deny-
ing opportunities. 
The Senate code on every other issue 
essentially survived until 1971, within 
our lifetimes. In 1971, we started to see 
the filibuster go to not just 1 or 2 fili-
busters a year but to 12, a dozen—imag-
ine that—and in 1974 to 32. That was 
just so outrageous because each one 
takes up a week, and so this Senate 
said: That is unacceptable, so we must 
reform the rules. It led to the March 
1975 rule reform where they went from 
two-thirds of those voting to 60 Mem-
bers voting. 
Well, the result is, that law back-
fired. To quickly look at it, cloture on 
amendments—each one taking up a 
week—expanded from some 6 times in 
the entire decade of the 1960s to 143 
times in the 2010s. 
For a motion to proceed, which is the 
ability to prevent debate from ever 
happening—the filibuster to promote 
debate was used to kill debate on the 
motion to proceed. It was used 10 times 
in the 1960s and 175 times in the 2010s. 
And, on nominations, it went from 
once in the 1960s to 545 times in the 
2010s. 
How did it happen that it expanded in 
the 2010s? Well, it happened because a 
Republican minority decided that they 
were going to obstruct as many of 
President Obama’s nominations as pos-
sible. And the Democrats did the same 
thing to President Trump. 
Each one of these takes up a week, 
an intervening day, 30 hours of debate, 
another hour of debate for every other 
Senator who wants to speak who didn’t 
get to—every single one. So when you 
have over 100 of these a year, it is im-
possible to have a Senate that works. 
The Senate has been broken. 
And perhaps the top champion of 
breaking the Senate is the minority 
leader, who has engaged in the tactic of 
delay and obstruction, arguing he 
wanted to make sure—his top priority 
was making sure President Obama was 
never reelected, and stopping him from 
having an agenda and stopping him 
from putting people into office was the 
strategy. And Democrats took much 
the same approach to President Trump. 
So we have both done it, but the Sen-
ate is blown up now. 
In that original Congress, the Senate, 
the first term, it said there were about 
four Cabinet members to confirm, plus 
Ambassadors and some judges—four. 
We have over a thousand positions 
now. It is completely out of sync. The 
gears don’t match. 
And every time there is a filibuster 
on a nomination, it is another week 
lost. So the Senate is now paralyzed 
because here is the interesting prospect 
and the unfortunate reality of 60 votes. 
The interesting prospect is that a ma-
jority of less than 60 has to reach out 
to the minority to get something done. 
And that sounds like it is going to in-
crease cooperation and negotiation, 
but the unfortunate reality, in our 
tribal, partisan politics, is the minor-
ity looks at that and says: If we can 
hold 41 Senators from agreeing to close 
debate, we can paralyze the majority. 
The overwhelming impact is paralysis 
and accentuation of partisanship of our 
current filibuster. 
Today’s debate, it is not about fili-
buster versus no filibuster; it is about 
fixing a broken Senate. It is about the 
difference, as my colleague from Vir-
ginia has said, from the secret, no-show 
filibuster to the public, talking fili-
buster. 
Before 1975, people who wanted to ex-
tend debate had to actually debate. 
What a notion. They had to show up. 
And that is painful and difficult to 
maintain continuous debate, and so 
there is an incentive to negotiate. But 
when there is a no-show, no-effort fili-
buster, where those who say they want 
to debate are off on vacation because 60 
votes is required with or without them, 
there is no incentive to negotiate. 
So if you believe the Senate should 
be a place that encourages negotiation, 
we need a public filibuster, not a se-
cret, silent filibuster. If you believe 
that the public should be able to par-
ticipate in our process, we need not a 
secret, silent filibuster but a public, 
talking filibuster. We are here, day 
after day, week after week. We are de-
bating the issue. We are raising amend-
ments. We are considering amend-
ments. And what is the result? The 
citizens weigh in. They say: Finally, 
they are considering it. Finally, they 
are debating it. Finally, they are going 
to take a vote. Now we can weigh in ef-
fectively in this moment. 
So this is about restoring, reinvigo-
rating debate, restoring the public role, 
creating an incentive to negotiate, cre-
ating an incentive for both sides to 
work to reach an accommodation. 
Now, my Republican friends have 
made much today of Democrats signing 
a letter saying that they are deter-
mined to ‘‘preserve the ability of Mem-
bers to engage in extended debate’’—in-
teresting—‘‘preserve 
the 
ability 
of 
Members to engage in extended de-
bate.’’ To preserve the ability to en-
gage in extended debate means we need 
the talking, public filibuster, not the 
secret, silent filibuster which requires 
no debate at all. So, to my Republican 
colleagues who signed this letter, this 
is your opportunity to do what you 
said. Vote for the principle that the 
majority leader is going to be laying 
out forthwith. 
So, colleagues, if you believe in the 
Founders’ vision of this Senate, of 
hearing everyone and hearing everyone 
well but eventually getting to a final 
bill; if you believe in the Senate code, 
which stood up for so long, not even 
needing a rule to enforce it, except for 
civil rights it held up through 1971; if 
you want more debate and you want 
people who want a debate to have to 
show up to debate, support the talking 
filibuster.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S345 
January 19, 2022 
If you believe there should be an in-
centive for both the majority and mi-
nority to negotiate, support the talk-
ing filibuster. If you believe the public 
should have the ability to see us debat-
ing issues, then support the talking fil-
ibuster. 
My colleagues have said: We must de-
fend the minority leverage. Amen to 
that. That is why, in 2011, I put forward 
in this Chamber the talking filibuster 
and said we need to defend the minori-
ty’s right to participate. 
Today, we have another opportunity 
to defend the minority’s participation, 
to speak at length for at least twice on 
any given question, on through a com-
plex bill. But that, colleagues, depends 
upon ending the era of the secret, si-
lent source of partisanship and paral-
ysis that we currently have and replac-
ing it with the talking, public fili-
buster. 
I encourage you all to stand today 
for the Senate to work and for the Sen-
ate, most importantly, to defend the 
fundamental rights of every American 
to access the ballot box. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, if my 
colleague will yield for one second, sir. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Is it possible we can 
enter into a talking filibuster now 
without a rules change? Could we start 
a talking filibuster right now without 
a rules change? 
Mr. MERKLEY. To my colleague 
from West Virginia, the challenge that 
we have today is that, in the course of 
Senate debate, it is never possible to 
get to a debate on the final question. 
And the proposal that the majority 
leader is putting forward is saying it is 
time to get to that final debate, and on 
that final debate every Senator can 
speak twice. 
I can tell you, leadership on both 
sides probably is nervous about the 
idea of 100 Senators speaking twice, at 
length, but the single innovation of the 
talking filibuster is to say that there 
will be a period of debate in which we 
will consider final passage with all four 
of the mechanisms that currently 
exist, three that were created at the 
foundation—and that is the break in 
debate and that is the two-speech rule 
and that is unanimous consent and the 
60 votes that was created in 1975. 
Mr. MANCHIN. I understand. The 
way this rule reads right now, sir: dur-
ing which all amendments, motions, 
and points of order are not in order, 
and any appeal shall be determined 
without debate. That doesn’t allow any 
amendments whatsoever. 
Mr. MERKLEY. The vision, the vi-
sion of this—— 
Mr. MANCHIN. That is the way this 
reads, what we are voting on right now. 
Mr. 
MERKLEY. 
Excuse 
me. 
Go 
ahead. 
Mr. MANCHIN. I am saying, that is 
what we are voting on right now. 
Mr. MERKLEY. What we are voting 
on now is to go to final passage with 
continuous debate, and the majority 
leader’s team has crafted this to ensure 
continuous debate. 
Mr. MANCHIN. No amendments. No 
amendments. 
Mr. MERKLEY. That would be—had 
we gotten to the bill and been able to 
engage in—— 
Mr. 
MANCHIN. 
We 
didn’t 
have 
amendments on the bill. No amend-
ments, no motions, no points of order. 
Mr. MERKLEY. To my colleague 
from West Virginia, your question is, 
What are the characteristics that de-
fine continuous debate on final pas-
sage? And it is defined as without 
interruptions that take us in other di-
rections than the question of final pas-
sage of the bill. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
distinguished Republican leader. 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
well, I think we can all agree on one 
thing: It has been a long day. Almost 
everybody has had something to say, 
and the reason for that is this is an im-
portant day in the history of the Sen-
ate. It could be argued it is the most 
important day in the history of the 
Senate as an institution. This very day 
that we are just wrapping up is, in all 
likelihood, the most important day in 
the history of the Senate as an institu-
tion. 
This evening, fewer than 60 Senators 
voted to advance a piece of legislation 
so it didn’t move forward. It is pretty 
common around here. It happens fre-
quently. In fact, it happened less than 
a week ago, as we know, when our 
Democratic colleagues used the 60-vote 
threshold to block sanctions against 
Putin’s pipeline. 
In 2020, the Democrats used the fili-
buster multiple times to delay the 
CARES Act, kill Senator TIM SCOTT’s 
police reform bill, block bipartisan pro-
tections for unborn children. 
Senate minorities can apply the 
brakes to small majorities. Senate mi-
norities can apply the brakes to small 
majorities. 
This 
institution 
makes 
major changes earn major buy-in. This 
institution 
requires 
that 
major 
changes receive major buy-in. For dec-
ades, Americans on all sides acknowl-
edged this. 
Believe it or not, 15 years ago—sev-
eral of us were here 15 years ago—there 
were 180 civil rights organizations—180 
civil 
rights 
organizations—that 
weighed in in support of the filibuster 
because, at that particular point, the 
filibuster was being used to stop judges 
appointed by Bush 43. So over 100 civil 
rights organizations wrote us a letter 
saying the filibuster is indispensable. 
It served their purpose at that par-
ticular time. 
For decades—literally, decades—Sen-
ators on both sides agreed. We have 
quoted each other back and forth here, 
eloquent filibuster defenses from col-
leagues across the aisle when it bene-
fited them to make those speeches. 
But, colleagues, a leader’s true colors 
are not revealed when long-term prin-
ciples and short-term power line up to-
gether. That is easy, when what you 
are trying to achieve lines up with the 
tactics. The measure of a leader is not 
what he or she chooses; it is what they 
choose when those two paths diverge, 
go in a different direction. 
Now, half of us, on this side of the 
aisle, just spent 4 years—4 years—when 
we were in the majority and we had a 
President of our party asking us to do 
what they are trying to do tonight, and 
we had a one-word answer: No. No. We 
are not going to fracture the institu-
tion to achieve some short-term advan-
tage. 
And actually, astonishingly enough— 
GRASSLEY was here then—in 1994, the 
best Republican off-year election, argu-
ably, in American history took the 
House for the first time in 40 years, got 
the majority back in the Senate. 
Tom Harkin—CHUCK GRASSLEY’s col-
league from Iowa, the Democrat—on 
day one of that session, through the 
regular order, offered a rule change to 
lower the threshold to 51. So who would 
have benefited from that? This brand- 
new, enthusiastic majority just having 
swept the country would have been the 
principal beneficiary of lowering the 
threshold to 51. Not one single Repub-
lican in the new majority voted to give 
themselves an advantage that would 
break the Senate—not one. So we have 
been consistent on this side of the aisle 
in support of this institution as long as 
I have been here. 
They face the same decision now. 
They have a choice. They could break 
the institution to achieve what they 
want or defend the institution. And so 
they pivoted. And that is why so many 
of them look so foolish because they 
have been on the opposite side of this, 
not a long time ago but quite recently. 
And so they tried to carve out a special 
category here that somehow this issue 
is different from all the other issues 
and should be treated differently. 
Well, on the merits, as we have dis-
cussed ad nauseam here, this is some-
thing they have been trying to do for a 
long time. The rationale for it has 
changed periodically, depending upon 
what seemed to make sense. But dial it 
up any way you choose to, this is a plot 
to break the Senate—a plot to break 
the Senate. Over the issue they have 
chosen, one-half of 1 percent of the 
American people say election law is 
their most pressing concern—one-half 
of 1 percent of the American people. 
Actually, Americans, as a number of 
you have said during the course of this 
long day, believe voting laws are actu-
ally too loose, rather than too strict, 
and as you have said over and over and 
over again, Georgia’s new law is argu-
ably more progressive than New York 
or Delaware. All of you have said that 
all day long. 
And this? This is the basis upon 
which the President of the United 
States calls people like us racists, trai-
tors? Over this? Over how many days of 
early voting you are going to have? 
Really? This is the basis on which 40- 
plus Senate Democrats want to not

January 19, 2022 
only break their word but break the 
Senate. 
Now, the so-called talking filibuster 
proposal is smoke and mirrors, just 
smoke and mirrors. There is really 
only one question we are dealing with 
here, just one. It is not complicated. 
Will it take 60 votes to pass massive 
changes or a simple majority to ram 
them through? That is what is at stake 
here, nothing else. Will slender majori-
ties need to build coalitions across the 
aisle or not? Will huge chunks of Fed-
eral law reverse themselves whenever 
gavels change hands? We have talked 
about this all day long. That is what 
this is about. 
But, 
colleagues, 
something 
even 
more fundamental is at stake tonight. 
Everyone in this Chamber knows that 
factional fires are burning hot all 
across our country. As I look around, I 
don’t know if this many of us have ac-
tually gathered in this Chamber since 
January 6 of last year. We were all in 
here then. I stood up that day, and I 
said self-government requires shared 
respect for basic ground rules. I said we 
couldn’t keep drifting into two tribes 
and delegitimizing the few institutions 
we still share. 
Yes, the divisions run deep. Com-
promise is certainly challenging. But it 
would not serve a divided country if 
two factions take turns ruling over one 
another with an iron fist. 
Here is a solution for a divided coun-
try: Thoughtful compromise every-
where we can agree, and, when we can’t 
agree, it just doesn’t happen. 
The American people are closely di-
vided. We are reflected here with a 50– 
50 Senate, for the longest time in 
American history. 
There is not a mandate to fundamen-
tally transform America into some-
thing it has never been. It is not what 
the voters voted for. We have a narrow 
majority trying to jam through, one 
after another, proposals to fundamen-
tally turn us into something we have 
never been. 
Well, here is the good news: The 
Framers custom built—custom built— 
the Senate to stop this kind of thing. 
That is why this institution was con-
structed in the first place. We are sit-
ting in the place designed to stop this 
kind of thing, and we have an oppor-
tunity to do it here tonight. 
This is the first time in history that 
a Senate majority leader, who is sup-
posed to safeguard this institution, has 
convinced—convinced—nearly all of his 
party to attack the institution. That 
hasn’t happened before. 
Tonight, for the first time in history, 
almost an entire political party will 
write in permanent ink that they 
would shatter the soul of Senate for 
short-term power—shatter the soul of 
the Senate for short-term power. But 
the brave bipartisan majority of this 
party is about to stop them—about to 
stop them. We will stop the Democratic 
leader from silencing the voices of mil-
lions upon millions of Americans who 
have a right to be heard in this Cham-
ber, many of them represented by us 
who come from small States. They de-
risively look down on us as a flyover 
territory, a place nobody wants to 
stop. 
The Senate was designed to represent 
those people. Every State gets two 
Senators. Some States have only one 
House Member but two Senators. We 
are here to protect middle America, 
and the supermajority threshold in the 
Senate makes that even more possible. 
So they can’t run roughshod over us. 
They can’t run roughshod over us and 
the people we represent. 
When our country needs leaders to 
fight the fires of factualism, almost 
half the Senate over here wants to lit-
erally dump more gasoline right on top 
of it. 
When our institutions needed defend-
ing, a sitting President and a majority 
leader have made smashing the Senate 
an unofficial part of their party’s plat-
form. The President of the United 
States and the majority leader of the 
Senate have made breaking the Senate 
a central part of their plan for Amer-
ica. 
Thanks to the courageous position of 
at least a few of their Members, they 
will not succeed. This country will be 
shielded from their radicalism tonight. 
And make no mistake about it, this is 
radicalism designed to fundamentally 
change America in every conceivable 
way, to the disadvantage of virtually 
all of the constituents represented by 
people on this side of the aisle—and 
theirs as well, if they were willing to 
admit it. 
So the Senate will be safe tonight. 
The Senate will be safe tonight. Amer-
ica can breathe a sigh of relief. This 
radicalism will have been stopped, and 
it is a good day for America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, ‘‘a de-
nial of this sacred right [to vote] is a 
tragic betrayal of the highest man-
dates of our democratic tradition’’—‘‘a 
tragic betrayal of the highest man-
dates of our democratic tradition.’’ 
Those were the words of Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., in his speech where 
he implored the Federal Government— 
and especially Congress—to take ac-
tion on a simple request: ‘‘Give us the 
ballot.’’ 
Today, the American people are say-
ing the same thing: Give us the ballot. 
Let us not sink into the abyss of voter 
suppression. Give us the ballot. 
A few hours ago, this Chamber, with 
the eyes of the Nation upon it and with 
the evidence of voter suppression laid 
bare before it, with very little refuta-
tion from the other side—they don’t 
discuss the issues going on in the 
States—took a vote to move to final 
passage on the Freedom to Vote Act 
and the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. It received 50 votes, 
and with the Vice President, we would 
have had the majority. Unfortunately, 
under the current rules of the Senate, 
the door is closed to moving forward on 
these laws—so much part of the core 
values of our country. 
But make no mistake, on voting 
rights, inaction is not an option. Inac-
tion is not an option. And now, the 
Senate must rise to the occasion. The 
only way to achieve our goal of passing 
voting rights, ending dark money, and 
ending partisan gerrymandering is by 
changing the rules because our col-
leagues from the other side of the aisle 
don’t want to join us in these noble en-
deavors. This evening, we have pro-
posed a modest, one-time change of 
Senate rules to establish a talking fili-
buster for this voting rights legisla-
tion. It fundamentally says: If you 
want to block something as sacred as 
voting rights, you must do it out in the 
open. You must debate it and show the 
American people where you stand. You 
can’t sit in your office and block every-
thing. 
In short, every Senator will be al-
lowed to speak twice on final passage 
of voting rights legislation. They can 
speak as long as they want—days, if 
they can muster it—but all other dila-
tory tactics, any dilatory amendments, 
motions, and points of order, shall be 
deemed out of order, and any appeal 
shall be determined without debate. 
After each Member has had their say, 
it will be time to vote, and only 50 
votes will be required for passage. 
Mr. President, this is a very simple, 
limited proposal, and it only applies to 
the voting rights bill before us today. 
Now, look, there is no denying that 
Members of this body have divergent 
views about whether the filibuster in 
the 21st century is a good thing or a 
bad thing. Some have argued that it 
actually helps bring us together— 
something I don’t agree with and which 
I have not seen evidence of, as the elo-
quent statement by the Senator of Or-
egon has—we have just seen. But even 
for those who feel that the filibuster is 
a good thing and helps bring us to-
gether, I would ask this question: Isn’t 
protecting voting rights, the most fun-
damental wellspring of this democracy, 
more important than a rule in this 
Chamber? 
Let me say that again. Even if you 
think the filibuster is a good thing, 
isn’t protecting voting rights and pre-
venting their diminution more impor-
tant, particularly when this rule was 
not always in existence and was not en-
visioned by the Founders? That is the 
key question we should each ask our-
selves. 
To be clear, minority rights are a 
vital feature of this Chamber, but the 
Senate was never envisioned to allow 
an absolute minority party veto— 
never. In fact, the Founders expressly 
rejected the inclusion of a super-
majority requirement for the Senate. 
Hamilton called the idea ‘‘poison.’’ 
If there is anything undermining the 
spirit of the Senate today, it is, frank-
ly, the way things work right now. It is 
time for the Senate to adapt, to meet 
the challenge of the modern age. Rob-
ert Byrd himself recognized this truth,

that Senate rules must sometimes 
change. And our proposal today is a 
limited, carefully tailored step we can 
take to make the rules of the Senate 
achieve this body’s original purpose. 
Finally, there are some who fear the 
consequences of passing this bill with 
no support from the other party. I 
would certainly prefer that Repub-
licans work with us on this issue, and 
voting rights has always been a bipar-
tisan issue in the past. But we must be 
honest. We have made many earnest ef-
forts to draft and debate bipartisan leg-
islation that deals with voter suppres-
sion, dark money, and partisan gerry-
mandering, but those efforts by many 
Members of our caucus have come up 
with no takers. 
The old GOP worked with Democrats 
on voting rights for decades, but, un-
fortunately, that is not the case today. 
In the words of the late Senator Wag-
ner, whose seat I hold, delivered on this 
floor nearly 80 years ago: 
Unity in a democracy is not achieved by 
side-stepping and ignoring issues. That is 
false unity. That is only the illusion of 
unity. 
Unity in a democracy is the unity which is 
achieved by facing issues, by threshing out 
our differences, and by standing upon the de-
cision of the majority. 
Again: 
Unity in a democracy is not achieved by 
side-stepping . . . issues. 
Fittingly, he spoke those words in 
the face of a filibuster on the anti-poll 
tax legislation. 
Tonight, let us sidestep voting rights 
no more. 
The question before the Senate is, 
How will we find a path forward on pro-
tecting our freedoms in this turbulent 
21st century? The only choice to move 
forward on these vital issues is to 
change the rules in the modest way we 
have proposed. 
My colleagues—my colleagues—his-
tory is watching us. Let us choose in 
favor of our democracy. Let us stand 
up and defend the precious right to 
vote. 
MOTION TO PROCEED TO MOTION TO RECONSIDER 
Mr. President, I move to proceed to 
the motion to reconsider the vote by 
which cloture was not invoked on the 
motion to concur in the House amend-
ment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 
5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
question is on agreeing to the motion 
to proceed to the motion to reconsider. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
make a point of order that for this 
message from the House, with respect 
to H.R. 5746, the only debate in order 
during consideration of the message be 
on the question of adoption of the mo-
tion to concur in the amendment of the 
House; further, that no further amend-
ments, motions, or points of order be in 
order and that any appeals be deter-
mined without debate. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fol-
lowing the rules of the Senate, the 
point of order is not sustained as it is 
a compound motion that would require 
consent. 
APPEALING THE RULING OF THE CHAIR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ap-
peal the ruling of the Chair. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
question is, Shall the ruling of the 
Chair stand as the decision of the Sen-
ate? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll.

MOTION WITHDRAWN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
withdraw the motion to proceed to the 
motion to reconsider the failed cloture 
vote. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
motion is withdrawn. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, for the infor-
mation of the Senate, there will be no 
further rollcall votes tonight. Senators 
should expect a rollcall vote at noon 
tomorrow on the confirmation of Holly 
Thomas to be the U.S. circuit judge for 
the Ninth Circuit. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before I close the Senate and do that 
kind of paperwork, I want to just make 
a few remarks about tonight’s vote. 
So while tonight’s vote was dis-
appointing, it will not deter Senate 
Democrats from continuing our fight 
against voter suppression, dark money, 
and partisan gerrymandering. 
With no support from Senate Repub-
licans, many of whom deny the very 
existence of voter suppression, we faced 
an uphill battle, but because of this 
fight, and the fact that each Senator 
had to show where they stand, we are 
closer to achieving our goal of passing 
vital voter protection legislation. 
We take inspiration from Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. He kept fighting for 
voting rights through every obstacle, 
and we will do the same. We will not 
quit. 
Now that every Senator has gone on 
record, the American people have seen 
who is on the side of protecting voting 
rights, and it will only strengthen our 
resolve as we work to ensure that our 
democracy does not backslide. 
This vote is another step forward in 
the long march for universal voting 
rights. The Democratic caucus pledges 
to keep working until voting rights are 
protected for every American. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—H.R. 5746 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the House 
message to accompany H.R. 5746 no 
longer be the pending business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER BARBER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
very few people find the time to lead 
their city’s largest law firm, serve on a 
university’s board of trustees, rep-
resent their country at the United Na-
tions, and remain active in civic life in 
their hometown. Even fewer can ac-
complish these things before the age of 
40. But Jennifer Barber of Louisville, 
KY, has managed to do all this—and 
more. Today, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in honoring Jennifer for her re-
cent career milestone and for her years 
of service to the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky. 
Jennifer, the daughter of Chinese im-
migrants, grew up working alongside 
her parents in the family’s restaurant, 
learning to value sacrifice, ambition, 
and effort. She became the first mem-
ber of her family to graduate college, 
earning both her bachelor’s degree and 
juris doctorate from the University of 
Kentucky. From there, she developed a 
specialty in tax law, taking her exper-
tise to Frost Brown Todd in 2013 and 
working her way up the corporate lad-
der.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S348 
January 19, 2022 
Jennifer’s professional and academic 
successes only tell half the story of her 
remarkable career. She has also dedi-
cated her time, energy, and talent to a 
range of important Kentucky organiza-
tions, from the University of Kentucky 
Board of Trustees, to the Kentucky 
State Fair Board, to the Kentucky Bar 
Foundation. In 2020, she took a brief 
break from her law firm to take her 
talents to the global stage, serving as a 
special adviser to the U.S. Ambassador 
to the United Nations and a U.S. Dele-
gate to the United Nations where she 
helped advance American priorities on 
human rights and foreign aid. 
Jennifer’s professional accomplish-
ments are so exciting because she 
achieved them at such a remarkably 
young age. Jennifer has done incredible 
work to improve Kentucky and serve 
our Nation, and I am confident her re-
cent promotion is just the first in a 
long list of successes yet to come. 
Louisville Business First highlighted 
Jennifer Barber’s new role in a recent 
article. I ask unanimous consent the 
article be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Louisville Business First, Jan. 18, 
2022] 
LOUISVILLE’S LARGEST LAW FIRM NAMES NEW 
MEMBER-IN-CHARGE 
Jennifer Barber was the first in her family 
to graduate high school. Now, she’s stepping 
into the member-in-charge role at Frost 
Brown Todd LLC, the largest law firm in 
Louisville. 
In an interview with Business First last 
week, Barber, the daughter of Chinese immi-
grants, recalled working alongside her par-
ents in the restaurant they owned, attrib-
uting her belief in the value of sacrifice and 
hard work to them. She said she saw their 
determination to provide a greater oppor-
tunity for her and her sisters. 
‘‘I’m very proud to be the first in my fam-
ily to graduate from high school and then 
college and law school, and I say that very 
humbly. It’s not something that I feel is 
something to pat myself on the back for,’’ 
she said. ‘‘I feel very much like, if not for 
our great country, which has endless oppor-
tunities for people who live here, and my 
parents being able to immigrate here and to 
make sacrifices and work hard . . . I 
wouldn’t be able to be now the member-in- 
charge.’’ 
She’s been with Frost Brown Todd since 
2013. Her focus there has been on tax law, 
economic incentives and government affairs. 
She’s also taken the lead on the firm’s civic 
and charitable engagement. She took a brief 
break from her practice to serve as a United 
States delegate to the United Nations and as 
a special adviser to U.S. ambassador to Can-
ada Kelly Craft for the 2020 session. 
As Barber spoke about each of these roles: 
the UN, the law firm, the charitable work, 
and her parents, she kept coming back to the 
concept of wanting to give back to her com-
munity. 
As a young attorney, she said she sought 
opportunities where she’d be able to help 
people, and she ultimately landed on tax law. 
She said her work with companies in this 
field allows her to assist with the city’s eco-
nomic development. 
‘‘Part of my civic engagement is to help 
these companies thrive, because when they 
thrive, we see that our communities are 
thriving,’’ she said. ‘‘Our citizens, our resi-
dents are employed and through taxes, we 
fund schools, and we fund fire departments, 
and we fund libraries . . . I think to the ex-
tent that we can spur stronger economic 
growth in our communities, everything else 
tends to rise as well.’’ 
She completed both her undergraduate and 
law degrees from the University of Ken-
tucky. She served on the university’s board 
of trustees, as well as its athletic committee. 
(Plus, she’s an avid sports fan—specifically 
cheering for the Wildcats.) 
She’s also served on the Kentucky State 
Fair Board, U.S. Bank Advisory Board, Lou-
isville Bar Association Board of Directors, 
Kentucky Bar Foundation, and American 
Bar Association Tax Section Executive Com-
mittee. 
While working with the UN, Barber said 
her main focus was on foreign policy, human 
rights and humanitarian assistance. She said 
it was a humbling experience to serve the 
country and see firsthand the positive im-
pacts the U.S. has on the rest of the world. 
She said her background as a daughter of 
immigrants 
helped 
her 
understand 
and 
empathize with others during her work at 
the UN. 
‘‘My family immigrated here from China 
. . . for me to be able to sit behind that 
United States placard and deliver remarks 
on behalf of the United States, it’s really one 
of the greatest honors,’’ Barber said. 
At the time of our conversation, Barber 
had only held the member-in-charge role for 
about two weeks. She said her mission with-
in the role was for the firm to continue to 
provide good client service and give back to 
its communities. 
‘‘It’s not lost on me that . . . I am minor-
ity, and I am a woman, and I’m so pleased to 
have this role for many reasons,’’ she said.’’ 
. . . I just think it’s a reflection of our firm 
and the legal profession as a whole really di-
versifying leadership and different perspec-
tives.’’ 
Barber is taking over the member-in- 
charge role from Geoff White, who held the 
position for seven years. White is still work-
ing for the firm in other leadership roles, ac-
cording to a news release on the leadership 
changes. 
The law firm, which has 294 local employ-
ees in total and 153 local attorneys according 
to the most recent LBF research, also an-
nounced that member Jason Williams will 
serve on the executive committee, the firm’s 
equivalent of a board of directors.

January 19, 2022 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING GARY AMBLE 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
today I wish to recognize Gary Amble 
of Kansas City, KS. For the last 30 
years, Gary has worked for his commu-
nity by broadcasting the weather. I 
would like to congratulate him on his 
retirement from KCTV5 and thank him 
for the invaluable service that he has 
provided Kansas over the last three 
decades. 
In 1987, Gary graduated from the Uni-
versity of Kansas with a degree in at-
mospheric science. Before his employ-
ment at KCTV5, Gary worked as the 
head anchor at WHO-TV in Des Moines, 
morning meteorologist for KDFA in 
Amarillo, weekend weathercaster for 
KSNT 
in 
Topeka, 
and 
chief 
weathercaster for Cable 6 in Lawrence. 
While in Des Moines, he worked 22 
hours continuously live on the air cov-
ering the unprecedented flood of 1993, 
which affected nine States along the 
Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. He has 
described it as a highlight of his career. 
Gary’s tenure at KCTV5 began in the 
summer of 1994, where he would stay 
for the next 28 years. There, he ce-
mented himself as the Kansas City 
area’s familiar face of weather, always 
charismatic and—most importantly— 
accurate whenever he came on screen. 
Because of his distinguished career, 
Gary has been awarded the American 
Meteorological Society seal of ap-
proval, and is currently a member of 
the society. 
Tracking and reporting on the weath-
er is great public service, so I take 
pride in recognizing Gary Amble as an 
exceptional member of the Kansas 
community. I would like to wish Gary 
and his family the best in this new 
chapter of their lives.∑ 
f 
REMEMBERING RUTH SCHEER 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor and memorialize a 
true representation of Kansas values. 
Mrs. Ruth Scheer departed this Earth 
on January 4, 2022, after a long life full 
of faith, family, service, and commu-
nity. 
Ruth was born and raised in Wichita, 
KS, where her parents, Clyde and 
Edith, provided a childhood full of love 
and support. She quickly picked up a 
love for music, beginning with the ac-
cordion before she turned 10. Her musi-
cal efforts, nurtured by her parents, 
continued to grow as she did. Ruth’s 
talent and dedication were rewarded by 
the opportunity to perform in the Na-
tional Piano Playing Auditions and 
winning 
multiple 
piano 
diplomas 
throughout high school and college. 
Her love of music and the arts contin-
ued as she started a family with her 
husband, Harold. She taught her chil-
dren to play various instruments and 
sing. She even led the family to per-
form multiple operettas in the commu-
nity as the ‘‘Scheer Delights.’’ 
Beyond music, Ruth also inspired 
children by publishing seven children’s 
books. Each book contained different 
messages, but at the heart of her lit-
erary philosophy was finding the best 
version of one’s self through God’s 
guidance. These books have undoubt-
edly touched many lives, and I appre-
ciate that she spent her career bringing 
such a wonderful sentiment to life. 
Ruth practiced what she preached by 
finding the best version of herself and 
employing her time and talents with 
an impressive number of prominent or-
ganizations throughout Wichita. High-
lights of her involvement include the 
First Evangelical Free Church, 3-time 
president of the Thursday Afternoon 
Music Club, member of the Alpha Beta 
Mothers Club, and she even received 
the Kansas Mother of the Year Award. 
In my own life, my parents showed 
me the importance of community and 
staying involved. A strong, connected 
community benefits its members by 
fostering happiness and success. Ruth 
embodied what it means to be a com-
munity builder, mother, and teacher. 
Wichita is a better place because of her 
efforts. She is a role model everyone 
should strive to emulate in their own 
communities. I ask my colleagues to 
join me in remembering Ruth Scheer 
and celebrating a life well-lived.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DEPUTY GABE VITT 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor a true hero from 
Labette County, KS, Deputy Gabe Vitt. 
His 
quick 
thinking 
and 
expertise 
helped save the life of a woman in a sit-
uation only seen in movies. 
Deputy Vitt was on patrol in Par-
sons, when he heard over his radio that 
a woman had been hit by a train. EMS 
was preparing to respond to the situa-
tion like they normally would, but the 
person calling about the accident dis-
connected before they could say where 
the woman was hit. By great luck and 
coincidence, Deputy Vitt was only a 
few blocks from the tracks. 
Realizing that emergency medical 
services wouldn’t be there in time, he 
rushed to the scene to find a woman 
with a severed leg. Making use of his 
EMT training from school at Labette 
Community College, Vitt was able to 
apply a tourniquet which stabilized the 
woman’s leg steady, ultimately saving 
her life. After the incident, Deputy 
Vitt credited that training heavily, de-
scribing his heroics as a natural reac-
tion to the situation. Had he not been 
nearby or received his EMT training, 
that woman may very well not be here 
today. 
I want to thank this brave officer for 
being so courageous to dive headfirst 
into peril. As the son of a police chief, 
I know the risks our men and women in 
blue take on each day. I admire these 
unique citizens for continually working 
to ensure our safety. Deputy Vitt has 
shown what true valor looks like, and 
Labette County is safer because of him. 
I ask now that my colleagues show this 
same admiration and recognition for 
Deputy Vitt and that he may stay safe 
protecting his community.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN J. NORMAN 
∑ Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor and congratulate 
Mr. Stephen J. Norman on his retire-
ment following 45 years of work in the 
community development and afford-
able housing industry. Stephen retires 
from Washington’s King County Hous-
ing Authority, where he has served as 
executive director and been an extraor-
dinary asset to our State and the 
greater Seattle-King County region for 
the last 25 years. 
Under Stephen’s leadership, KCHA 
has doubled the number of households 
served during his tenure and charted a 
path forward with an expansive vision 
of what a public housing authority can 
be in the 21st century. The authority’s 
housing stock and tenant-based pro-
gramming now house more than 55,000 
individuals, including over 20,000 chil-
dren. Stephen oversaw KCHA’s designa-
tion as one of the first Moving to Work 
Housing Authorities in the country, a 
recognition that enabled KCHA to pio-
neer efforts to partner with the edu-
cation, health, and workforce develop-
ment 
sectors 
to 
support 
residents 
throughout King County. 
As the former assistant commis-
sioner for Homeless Housing Develop-
ment in New York City, Stephen has 
always understood the importance of 
service-enriched supportive housing. I 
am particularly proud of the work that 
Stephen has undertaken to expand the 
HUD-VASH program in King County, 
connecting housing and service sys-
tems to support our veterans who are 
suffering the indignity of living out-
side. 
Stephen has also been a staunch 
champion of broadening the geographic 
availability 
of 
affordable 
housing. 
KCHA has invested heavily in work-
force housing, reflecting an ambitious 
Nation-leading effort to preserve exist-
ing housing in gentrifying and high-op-
portunity areas, and has pioneered mo-
bility initiatives for families with chil-
dren 
participating 
in 
the 
Housing 
Choice Voucher Program. The Creating 
Moves to Opportunity Program re-
search has served as the foundation for 
current efforts by the Federal Govern-
ment to increase geographic choice and 
mobility for households with low in-
comes. Time and time again, under 
Stephen’s leadership, KCHA’s programs 
have paved the way for broader policy 
change at the State and Federal level. 
The host of expansive housing and 
services programming at KCHA reflects 
Stephen’s extraordinary skills in devel-
oping cross-sector partnerships, even in 
the most difficult of circumstances. 
With his wit, inquisitiveness, and re-
lentless drive, Stephen has earned the 
collaboration and respect of leaders 
across the State and Nation. He has 
served as the president of the board of 
directors for the Council of Large Pub-
lic Housing Authorities and was the

founding vice president and current 
chair of the board for the Corporation 
for Supportive Housing. He has done all 
of this while keeping a pulse on the na-
tional housing landscape as a tireless 
advocate for expanded Federal support 
for affordable housing. I know for cer-
tain that because of his effective advo-
cacy and vision, today more people in 
King County and across the Nation 
have a place to call home. 
It has been a great privilege to learn 
from and collaborate with Stephen 
over the last two decades. And it is my 
honor to thank him for his lifetime of 
dedicated service to people with low in-
comes in King County, the State of 
Washington, and across the entire 
country. I wish him the very best dur-
ing his well-earned retirement.∑

AS 
‘‘MATERNAL 
HEALTH 
AWARE-
NESS DAY’’ 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself and Mr. 
MENENDEZ) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 492 
Whereas, each year in the United States, 
approximately 700 individuals die as a result 
of complications related to pregnancy and 
childbirth; 
Whereas the pregnancy-related mortality 
ratio, defined as the number of pregnancy-re-
lated deaths per 100,000 live births, more 
than doubled in the United States between 
1987 and 2017; 
Whereas the United States is one of the 
only Organisation for Economic Co-oper-
ation and Development member countries in 
which the maternal mortality rate has in-
creased over the last several decades; 
Whereas, of all pregnancy-related deaths in 
the United States between 2011 and 2016— 
(1) nearly 32 percent occurred during preg-
nancy; 
(2) approximately 35 percent occurred dur-
ing childbirth or the week after childbirth; 
and 
(3) 33 percent occurred between 1 week and 
1 year postpartum; 
Whereas more than 60 percent of maternal 
deaths in the United States are preventable; 
Whereas, each year, more than 50,000 indi-
viduals in the United States suffer from a 
‘‘near miss’’ or severe maternal morbidity, 
which includes potentially life-threatening 
complications that arise from labor and 
childbirth; 
Whereas approximately 17 percent of indi-
viduals who give birth in a hospital in the 
United States report experiencing 1 or more 
types of mistreatment, such as— 
(1) loss of autonomy; 
(2) being shouted at, scolded, or threat-
ened; or 
(3) being ignored or refused or receiving no 
response to requests for help; 
Whereas certain social determinants of 
health, including bias and racism, have a 
negative impact on maternal health out-
comes; 
Whereas significant disparities in maternal 
health outcomes exist in the United States, 
including that—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S353 
January 19, 2022 
(1) Black individuals are more than 3 times 
as likely to die from a pregnancy-related 
cause as are white individuals; 
(2) American Indian and Alaska Native in-
dividuals are more than twice as likely to 
die from a pregnancy-related cause as are 
white individuals; 
(3) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Na-
tive individuals with at least some college 
education are more likely to die from a preg-
nancy-related cause than are individuals of 
all other racial and ethnic backgrounds with 
less than a high school diploma; 
(4) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Na-
tive individuals are about twice as likely to 
suffer from severe maternal morbidity as are 
white individuals; 
(5) individuals who live in rural areas have 
a greater likelihood of severe maternal mor-
bidity and mortality, compared to individ-
uals who live in urban areas; 
(6) less than 1⁄2 of rural counties have a hos-
pital with obstetric services; 
(7) counties with more Black and Hispanic 
residents and lower median incomes are less 
likely to have access to hospital obstetric 
services; 
(8) more than 50 percent of individuals who 
live in a rural area must travel more than 30 
minutes to access hospital obstetric services, 
compared to 7 percent of individuals who live 
in urban areas; and 
(9) American Indian and Alaska Native in-
dividuals living in rural communities are 
twice as likely as their white counterparts 
to report receiving late or no prenatal care; 
Whereas pregnant individuals may be at 
increased risk for severe outcomes associ-
ated with COVID–19, as— 
(1) pregnant individuals with symptomatic 
COVID–19 are more likely to be admitted to 
an intensive care unit, receive invasive ven-
tilation, and receive extracorporeal mem-
brane oxygenation (commonly known as 
‘‘ECMO’’) treatment, compared to nonpreg-
nant individuals with symptomatic COVID– 
19; 
(2) pregnant individuals with symptomatic 
COVID–19 are at a 70-percent increased risk 
for death, compared to nonpregnant individ-
uals with symptomatic COVID–19; and 
(3) pregnant individuals with COVID–19 are 
at risk for pre-term delivery and stillbirth; 
Whereas 49 States have designated com-
mittees to review maternal deaths; 
Whereas State and local maternal mor-
tality review committees are positioned to 
comprehensively assess maternal deaths and 
identify opportunities for prevention; 
Whereas 43 States are participating in the 
Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, 
which promotes consistent and safe mater-
nity care to reduce maternal morbidity and 
mortality; 
Whereas 
community-based 
maternal 
health care models, including midwifery 
childbirth services, doula support services, 
community and perinatal health worker 
services, and group prenatal care, in collabo-
ration with culturally competent physician 
care, show great promise in improving ma-
ternal health outcomes and reducing dispari-
ties in maternal health outcomes; 
Whereas many organizations have imple-
mented initiatives to educate patients and 
providers about— 
(1) all causes of, contributing factors to, 
and disparities in maternal mortality; 
(2) the prevention of pregnancy-related 
deaths; and 
(3) the importance of listening to and em-
powering all people to report pregnancy-re-
lated medical issues; and 
Whereas several States, communities, and 
organizations recognize January 23 as ‘‘Ma-
ternal Health Awareness Day’’ to raise 
awareness about maternal health and pro-
mote maternal safety: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates January 23, 2022, as ‘‘Mater-
nal Health Awareness Day’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Mater-
nal Health Awareness Day, including— 
(A) raising public awareness about mater-
nal mortality, maternal morbidity, and dis-
parities in maternal health outcomes; and 
(B) encouraging the Federal Government, 
States, territories, Tribes, local commu-
nities, public health organizations, physi-
cians, health care providers, and others to 
take action to reduce adverse maternal 
health outcomes and improve maternal safe-
ty; 
(3) promotes initiatives— 
(A) to address and eliminate disparities in 
maternal health outcomes; and 
(B) to ensure respectful and equitable ma-
ternity care practices; 
(4) honors those who have passed away as a 
result of pregnancy-related causes; and 
(5) supports and recognizes the need for 
further investments in efforts to improve 
maternal health, eliminate disparities in 
maternal health outcomes, and promote re-
spectful and equitable maternity care prac-
tices.

CRAMER, Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. BRAUN, Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH, Mr. CRUZ, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. 
BOOZMAN, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. DAINES, and 
Mr. WICKER) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
Whereas the 14th Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States provides every 
American with equal protection under the 
law; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States protects 
Americans against compelled speech; 
Whereas the idea that any race, ethnicity, 
color, or national origin is inherently supe-
rior or inferior should not be forced into any 
required curriculum; 
Whereas teaching students that they are 
guilty or victimized based on the color of 
their skin is inherently discriminatory and 
anti-American; 
Whereas parents should have the ability to 
choose a school for their child based on their 
child’s individual needs, academic goals, and 
personal and religious beliefs; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic caused 
schools across the country to close for a sig-
nificant amount of time, creating a loss in 
learning progress and social and emotional 
skills for many students; 
Whereas COVID–19-related school closures 
and policy changes should ensure that the 
individualized educational plans for students 
with special needs and disabilities are met; 
Whereas parents are seeking more options 
for their child’s schooling due to learning 
loss, mask mandates, and COVID–19 vaccine 
mandates that many States and schools are 
imposing; 
Whereas school choice is more important 
than ever to ensure that children can attend 
the school that works best for them and in 
light of the threats imposed by Critical Race 
Theory and overreaching mandates regard-
ing COVID–19; 
Whereas it is documented that certain 
school boards are actively silencing the 
voices of concerned parents and impeding 
their ability to have a say in their children’s 
education; and 
Whereas Attorney General Merrick Gar-
land has abused his office by directing Fed-
eral law enforcement to engage in local 
issues, thus threatening legitimately con-
cerned parents away from advocating for 
their children’s right to a quality and unbi-
ased education: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and promotes the importance 
of parental involvement in their child’s edu-
cation; and 
(2) recognizes the necessity of school 
choice as a tool to empower all parents with 
the freedom to choose the best educational 
environment for their children and to reject 
the destructive ideologies promoted by many 
public schools, such as Critical Race Theory.

HONORING YORDENIS UGA´ S 
HERNA´ NDEZ 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
acknowledge 
Yordenis 
Uga´s 
Herna´ndez for his exceptional athletic accom-
plishments, fierce patriotism, and dedication to 
the cause of freedom for the Cuban people. 
Mr. Uga´s said on August 12, 2021, ‘‘I’m a 
fighter not only inside of the ring, but outside 
of the ring; I fight for the freedom of my peo-
ple. That’s the most important thing to me. I 
hope that all those who fight for freedom in 
Cuba are safe and know that I will fight for 
them on Saturday, August 21.’’ He also stated 
that, ‘‘I’m dedicating this fight to all my fellow 
Cubans fighting for freedom every day. I want 
to make history for my legacy and for all the 
Cubans around the world. This will be huge 
for the entire Latin community.’’ Mr. Uga´s re-
portedly listened to the pro-freedom Cuban 
song ‘‘Patria y Vida’’ (‘‘Homeland and Life’’) 
when heading into the ring for the fight, and 
went on to win that boxing match against long-
time champion, Manny Pacquiao. After his his-
toric win, he exclaimed, ‘‘Homeland and Life, 
Homeland and Life, not Homeland or Death,’’ 
which is a phrase that has become a mantra 
for Cuba’s pro-democracy movement. 
Mr. Uga´s is not just a fighter in the ring; he 
is a freedom fighter. He survived being sent to 
a Cuban prison, which was a punishment he 
endured simply for attempting to escape op-
pression. He ultimately was able to enter the 
United States in 2010. Since then, not only 
has Mr. Uga´s thrived in his field, but he has 
become an inspiration to people seeking free-
dom all over the world. 
Madam Speaker, I admire this talented and 
spirited athlete who left Cuba, but has never 
left the Cuban people. He has repeatedly ex-
pressed his solidarity with those brave leaders 
and activists on the island who are risking ev-
erything for liberty. Mr. Uga´s has inspired a 
new generation of Cubans both in Cuba and 
in exile, and I commend him for his fierce 
dedication and potency—both inside and out-
side the ring.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. MADISON CAWTHORN 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, during 
the process of voting proxy, there was a 
human error made, which unfortunately re-
flected a no vote. My vote should have re-
flected yes. 
Had I been present, I would have voted 
YEA on Roll Call No. 10. 
FIREFIGHTER BENJAMIN POLSON 
HON. CORI BUSH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, St. Louis and 
I rise to offer our deepest condolences to the 
Polson family and friends on the loss of fire-
fighter Benjamin James Polson, a dear mem-
ber of our St. Louis community and Engine 
House 13. 
Benjamin Polson was courageous. Every 
day he went to work with the goal of saving 
lives, and our St. Louis community is indebted 
to him for his commitment to that work. As 
Congresswoman for Missouri’s First District, I 
am deeply honored to represent Engine 
House 13, and I, like so many of our neigh-
bors, am forever grateful to Mr. Polson. Like 
his father, a retired fire captain, and his moth-
er, an elementary school teacher, Mr. Polson 
lived a life dedicated to the care and service 
of his community, joining the St. Louis Fire 
Department in 2019. He will undoubtedly be 
missed by everyone who loved him, and his 
legacy will live on through his family, friends, 
and colleagues. St. Louis will never forget Mr. 
Polson’s relentless dedication to our city as a 
first responder.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JAMES 
RAEBEL 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my sincere gratitude, and the 
gratitude of all Central Washingtonians, to De-
tective Sergeant James A. Raebel, and to 
congratulate him on his well-deserved retire-
ment. 
During his more than forty years of service 
with the Pasco Police Department, Det. Sgt. 
Raebel has truly embodied what it means to 
‘‘serve and protect’’, working as a K-9 handler, 
an undercover narcotics officer, a detective, 
and a sergeant. Because of his work, the 
Pasco community truly was safer. 
Without dedicated public servants like Det. 
Sgt. Raebel, our Republic, which is sustained 
by a system of law and order, and our very 
way of life could not endure. 
I wish Det. Sgt. Raebel the very best as he 
enters this next chapter of his life. I commend 
him on a lifetime of service to his friends, fam-
ily, and neighbors, and on behalf of all Central 
Washingtonians, I thank him for his service. 
HONORING THE SPIRITED 
LEADERSHIP OF DEBBIE MACCOY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to shine a bright light on the ultimate ex-
ample of leadership set by a resident of east-
ern Connecticut’s second district, Debbie 
MacCoy. For more than six years, Debbie has 
been on the front lines of the crumbling foun-
dations crisis affecting the State of Con-
necticut, and now we know, the State of Mas-
sachusetts as well. Throughout this crisis, 
Debbie has acted as a leading figure on the 
issue, dedicating countless hours in advocacy, 
education, and communication with local, 
state, and federal leaders, leading research-
ers, and international communities impacted 
by similar crises. Debbie has operated as a 
volunteer throughout this entire period and will 
soon retire from her role as one of the pre-
eminent community advocates on this issue. 
In part due to Debbie’s leadership, hundreds 
of families have now been able to remain in 
their home with a remodeled foundation, with 
thousands more in the pipeline. 
Organizing purely from a grassroots level, 
Debbie left her career of more than 30 years 
to allow the time necessary to focus on the 
issue of crumbling foundations. Each week, 
she has poured through correspondence from 
homeowners writing to her under duress seek-
ing guidance or assistance. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to represent 
constituents as dedicated as Debbie. I have 
had the privilege of knowing her personally for 
many years and can attest to her compassion 
for others and her high ethical standards in 
the way she conducts herself in the commu-
nity. If it were not for advocates like her, there 
would be far fewer solutions available to those 
affected by this crisis. I am grateful for 
Debbie’s fierce example of altruism and her 
decades-long friendship. To that end, I ask 
that my colleagues in the House join me in 
memorializing Deborah MacCoy’s efforts, set-
ting them further into stone and thanking her 
for all those who have benefitted from those 
efforts. Debbie will forever be a ‘‘concrete 
queen’’ for Connecticut residents. I thank her.

HON. TROY A. CARTER

Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker,

nal resting place on Saturday, January 15, 
2022 at the age of 112.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E48 
January 19, 2022 
Mr. Brooks was born in 1909 in Norwood, 
Louisiana and grew up outside of Stephenson, 
Mississippi. As part of a large family, his par-
ents were sharecroppers, and then worked at 
a sawmill during the Great Depression. 
He was drafted into the Army at 21 in 1940 
and was a participant in the famed Louisiana 
Maneuvers, where hundreds of thousands of 
soldiers conducted readiness exercises at 
home to prepare a response to Germany’s in-
vasion of Poland and France. 
After his required one-year service, Brooks 
was originally discharged and returned to New 
Orleans. However, after the attack on Pearl 
Harbor he re-enlisted. As he himself put it, 
after Pearl Harbor, ‘‘There was no question’’ 
that he would continue his service. 
He joined the 91st Engineer Battalion, a unit 
comprised of 1,193 Black enlisted soldiers and 
25 white officers. Soon, the unit boarded a 
converted ocean liner in New York and head-
ed to the South Pacific. 
After an extended voyage due to dodging 
submarines, the 91st arrived in Queensland, 
Australia, an Allied Forces defensive base in 
the war against Japan. 
Private First-Class Brooks fondly remem-
bers the Australian people’s acceptance of the 
Black soldiers and the equal treatment they 
experienced without the specter of segrega-
tion. 
Without Jim Crow, Brooks made white 
friends, and attended dance halls, cinemas 
and hotels freely—freedoms he had never ex-
perienced before. 
Brooks did not see combat during this de-
ployment, instead serving as a staff member 
to officers, lieutenants, and captains. 
While the white officers ate and lived sepa-
rately from the Black soldiers, the private said 
he never experienced discrimination or racism 
during his service. 
Their battalion was also tasked with building 
several buildings, hospitals, roads, housing, 
and recreation centers throughout Horn Island, 
Papua-New Guinea and the Philippines, dodg-
ing Japanese bomb raids. 
Brooks’ unit left the South Pacific in 1944 
and he left the service a year later. Many of 
his stories focus on the positive—a sign of his 
outlook on life. 
He received the Good Conduct Medal, Meri-
torious Service Medal, and Presidential Unit 
Medal. He wanted to attend college, but he 
never received his GI benefits—an injustice 
tragically felt by many Black veterans of the 
Second World War. His daughter Vanessa 
Brooks says that he was also never offered a 
low-interest bank loan or a reduced down pay-
ment for a house. 
Asked in late 2021 what he would like his 
legacy to be, he said, ‘‘I would like to be re-
membered as a strong man. A good soldier.’’ 
He certainly will be. 
Mr. Brooks was a local celebrity, and in 
2021 for his 112th birthday he was honored 
with a drive-through party. He danced on his 
porch during a serenade serenaded by the 
World War II museum’s musical trio, the Vic-
tory Belles. 
A military flyover flew above his Central City 
home in New Orleans. 
He loved the New Orleans Saints and spent 
this past holiday season cheering them on 
with family. 
Mr. Brooks lost his original Army uniform 
during Hurricane Katrina, but was presented 
with an authentic reproduction and his old 
unit’s badge last November. 
His family says they plan to bury Mr. Brooks 
in his replicate uniform, as was his request. 
My thoughts are with the Brooks family as 
they say goodbye to their beloved patriarch. 
I pray that Mr. Lawrence Brooks is at peace 
after his 112 years of life. We are all indebted 
to his service and should be inspired by this 
‘‘good soldier’s’’ positivity and zest for life. I 
know I am. 
Rest in God’s peace, Lawrence Brooks.

RECOGNIZING 
MY 
POSSIBILITIES 
FOUNDER 
AND 
CHAIRMAN, 
CHARMAINE SOLOMON 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize Mrs. Charmaine Solomon for her 
nearly fourteen years of dedicated service and 
leadership as the Founder and Chairman of 
the Board of My Possibilities, a first-of-its-kind 
organization serving adults with intellectual 
and developmental disabilities. 
As the mother of a special needs son, 
Charmaine envisioned a future where her son 
had access to opportunities following high 
school that would allow him to grow and dis-
cover his full potential. Determined to make 
her dream a reality, she partnered with two 
other mothers who shared her same vision— 
creating an organization whose services would 
improve not only their children’s future, but 
would also impact the lives of countless North 
Texans. 
Founded in 2008, My Possibilities served as 
the first full-day, full-year continuing edu-
cational program for adults with developmental 
disabilities in Collin County. Under her stead-
fast leadership, the organization has worked 
with over 600 HIPster’s—Hugely Important 
People—equipping them with the tools needed 
to develop employable skills and live full and 
independent lives. The college-style campus 
offers students educational, socialization, and 
residential opportunities as well as job place-
ment programs in the community. 
Throughout Charmaine’s tenure, she could 
regularly be found roaming the halls of the 
campus, interacting with students, and giving 
them high-fives and hugs. As a testament to 
her many efforts and in honor of her dedica-
tion, in 2019 the Plano Independent School 
District named their Adult Transition Center 
after Charmaine. 
In addition to her service with My Possibili-
ties, Mrs. Solomon is a Licensed Professional 
Counselor, devoted wife, and loving mother of 
four. She has been an active member of 
CASA of Collin County for more than eight 
years and has also volunteered her time work-
ing with at-risk youth at CITY House. 
Madam Speaker, as Charmaine Solomon 
begins a new chapter of her life following her 
final meeting as the longtime Chairman of My 
Possibilities, I ask my colleagues in the House 
of Representatives to join me today in hon-
oring her incredible impact in North Texas and 
the Third Congressional District. 
DOUG HALL 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Westminster 
Fire Chief Doug Hall for his 43 years of serv-
ice to the City of Westminster and surrounding 
communities. 
For four decades, Chief Hall has been ac-
tive within the Westminster community and fire 
department. Chief Hall began his career in 
1978 when the City had 18 firefighters, an ad-
ministrative assistant, and only one of its three 
fire stations was staffed. The Westminster Fire 
Department now has 143 employees, with 123 
serving in an emergency response capacity 
from six staffed fire stations. 
For the past 10 years, Chief Hall has served 
as Fire Chief. Under his leadership, West-
minster Fire Department earned an ISO Class 
1 
rating, 
the 
Center 
for 
Public 
Safety 
Excellence’s (CPSE) highest accreditation. 
Less than 300 agencies have received an ISO 
Class I accreditation nationally. In addition to 
overseeing the modernization of the depart-
ment, including upgrading public safety tele-
communications systems and other techno-
logical upgrades, Chief Hall developed new 
career pathways for future firefighters through 
a multi-agency firefighter academy and officer 
development program. 
Outside of the Westminster community, 
Chief Hall is recognized as a leader in the 
Colorado firefighting community. He served as 
President of the Board of Directors for the 
Adams and Jefferson County Hazardous Ma-
terials Response Authority from 2019 to 2021 
and represents Colorado municipalities as a 
member of the Colorado Fire Commission. 
Chief Hall has been a member of the West-
minster Rotary Club for 13 years. 
I extend my deepest appreciation for Chief 
Hall and his service and dedication to our 
community. I thank him for his continuous 
dedication to serving the people of Colorado.

HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Former Mayor John 
O’Reilly on the occasion of his retirement from 
the City of Dearborn, Michigan, where he has 
honorably served its citizens in various capac-
ities for past three decades. His significant 
contributions to our community are worthy of 
commendation. 
Mr. O’Reilly graduated from St. Alphonsus 
High School in Dearborn, attended Oakland 
University, and earned his law degree from 
the University of Detroit. He has been a main-
stay in Dearborn and throughout the State of 
Michigan during his celebrated career in public 
service and has followed in the footsteps of 
his father John B. O’Reilly, Sr., who served as 
Dearborn’s fourth mayor. Mr. O’Reilly began 
his career in public service as staff counsel

and district director for Congressman John D. 
Dingell, then as a chief of staff in the Michigan 
State Senate, and in serving as the Executive 
Director of the Southeast Michigan Community 
Alliance (SEMCA). In 1990, he was first elect-
ed to the Dearborn City Council, serving for 
seventeen years as Council President. In 
2006, he was sworn in as the Mayor of Dear-
born after the passing of Mayor Michael Guido 
and was officially elected to the role in a spe-
cial election in 2007. 
During his tenure as Mayor, Mr. O’Reilly has 
been a champion for economic growth and de-
velopment within the city, as well as for im-
proving Dearborn’s neighborhoods for all. 
Under his leadership, downtown was revital-
ized, and the city has continued to be recog-
nized as a center of culture, industry, and in-
novation. Mr. O’Reilly was highly involved in 
many state and community organizations, as 
the chair of the Downriver Community Con-
ference in 2014, President of the Michigan 
Municipal League in 2015, and was appointed 
to the Executive Committee of the Michigan 
Economic Development Corporation by Gov-
ernor Rick Snyder in 2016. Ever the advocate 
for his city, he served on the board of direc-
tors for the Dearborn Education Foundation, 
the West Dearborn Downtown Development 
Authority, and the East Dearborn Downtown 
Development Authority. He resides in his be-
loved Dearborn with his wife Christina, and to-
gether they have three children Devon, Sean, 
and Dylan. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Former Mayor John O’Reilly. 
We are grateful for his years spent serving the 
citizens of Dearborn. Personally, I am thankful 
for Jack’s years of friendship, counsel, and ad-
vice to my late husband John and I, he is 
someone who can always be counted on. I 
join with his family, friends, and colleagues in 
extending my best wishes to him in retirement.

H.R. 2930, THE STOP ACT 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 2022 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
as an original sponsor of H.R. 2930, The 
STOP Act, to celebrate the House’s passage 
of this important legislation and to express my 
disappointment over the fears that led to 57 of 
my colleagues voting against the bill and will 
lay out the facts to dispel those fears. The fact 
is the bill incorporates the concerns of the var-
ious stakeholders impacted by the legislation. 
This melding of concerns was eloquently stat-
ed on the House floor by Chairwoman LEGER 
FERNANDEZ, The STOP Act’s sponsor who told 
the House that: ‘‘This version reflects negotia-
tions with Tribal leaders, Federal agency ex-
perts, and the Authentic Tribal Art Dealers As-
sociation,’’ all of whom are impacted by the 
legislation. Chairwoman LEGER
FERNANDEZ 
comments on the melding of stakeholder con-
cerns were reinforced by Ranking Member 
WESTERMAN on the House floor when he stat-
ed: ‘‘I want to thank the sponsor of the legisla-
tion for working with stakeholders impacted by 
this bill, including the Acoma, the Pueblo, the 
Antique Tribal Art Dealers Association, the De-
partment of the Interior, the Department of 
Justice, and others.’’ Clearly, there was bipar-
tisan recognition that the concerns expressed 
by the bill’s various stakeholders were legiti-
mate and had to be incorporated into the final 
product. I am providing here, for the record, 
the ways in which The STOP Act meets the 
concerns of all the stakeholders mentioned by 
Chairwoman LEGER FERNANDEZ and Ranking 
Member WESTERMAN, which should dispel the 
fears of those opposed to bill. For starters, the 
bill does not ban all exports of Native Amer-
ican items as some fear. The bill only prohibits 
the export of items in violation of NAGPRA 
and ARPA, no other items for export are pro-
hibited. In fact, the bill clearly states: ‘‘an item 
made solely for commercial purposes is pre-
sumed to not qualify as an Item Requiring Ex-
port Certification;’’ while an additional provi-
sion specifies that Certification requirements 
be ‘‘sufficiently specific precise to ensure that 
an export certification is required only for 
Items Requiring Export Certification.’’ Clearly, 
the bill provides for a targeted ban on the ex-
port of illegal items, not the broad ban oppo-
nents fear. The facts dispel the fear that cer-
tification provenance requirements would lead 
to a de-facto export ban given the limited 
provenance of many items. The fact is the bill 
explicitly states: ‘‘include all available informa-
tion regarding the provenance,’’ so the bill 
clearly only requires ‘‘available information’’ 
and does not require the historical provenance 
of the item. Finally, opponents fear that The 
STOP Act placed the burden of proof on the 
citizen, not the government. In fact, the bill 
had no need to address this issue. It is a 
foundational principal of our democratic sys-
tem of laws and governance that the burden 
of proof is on the government, not the citizen. 
In conclusion, I would like to, once again, con-
gratulate the House for passing The Stop Act 
and urge all to consider these facts.

love and passion so many Texans show by 
traveling to Washington and voicing their sup-
port for sanctity of life. Even more travel to our 
state Capitol in Austin or advance the cause 
in our local communities. 
Your engagement is humbling and gives me 
faith that we can become the pro-life genera-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in recog-

tect innocent human life.
