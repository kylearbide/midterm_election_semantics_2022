Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 14, 2022 
No. 116 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, our guide, we yield our day, our 
plans, our wills to Your counsel. How 
much better is Your grace plan than 
anything we could create on our own? 
How much more valuable even than 
gold is Your wisdom? To have insight 
to Your understanding is better even 
than silver. 
May our minds, our hearts, our ears 
be open to discern Your guidance 
today. You set before each of us trust-
ed instruments of Your own divine 
counsel: staff directors and assistants, 
legal counselors, clerks and protocol 
experts, public affairs directors, all 
sorts of people who devote their time 
and talent to the success of this con-
gressional process. 
Speak clearly through them that we 
would hear. Stop us in our tracks if we 
head the wrong direction. Direct our 
steps that we would walk in Your will 
for our lives. 
Remind us that our plans fail when 
we choose not to receive Your counsel. 
Give us the wisdom to heed the guid-
ance You offer from all those whom 
You place in our path this day. Hear 
our prayers as we listen for Your voice. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas led the Pledge 
of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
COVERUP AT ROBB ELEMENTARY 
(Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I rise today to 
call upon the Governor of the State of 
Texas to denounce the coverup by the 
pusillanimous peace officers at Robb 
Elementary. 
If you have seen that video and it 
does not tug at your heart, you need 
help. I stand with those parents who 
are suffering. It is time for us to get to 
the bottom of what happened at that 
elementary school. The Governor laid 
the foundation at his initial press con-
ference for the coverup that has taken 
place. 
Governor, we are going to hold you 
accountable. You can’t allow such 
things to happen without denouncing 
them, at minimum, and there may be 
more that you can do. Use all of your 
powers, Governor, to bring justice to 
the families who are suffering. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CORREA). Members are reminded to di-
rect their remarks to the Chair. 
f 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A message from the Senate by Ms. 
Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that 
the Senate has passed a bill of the fol-
lowing title in which the concurrence 
of the House is requested: 
S. 3470. An act to provide for the imple-
mentation of certain trafficking in con-
tracting provisions, and for other purposes. 
f 
RETURN TO AMERICAN ENERGY 
DOMINANCE 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, this week, while gas prices re-
main near record levels across the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Presi-
dent Biden has chosen to spend his 
time meeting with Saudi Arabia in-
stead of American energy producers. 
By canceling the Keystone XL pipe-
line, and by refusing to allow new drill-
ing leases here in the U.S., the current 
administration has declared a war on 
American energy. Instead of using 
cleaner and less expensive American 
energy, President Biden is now turning 
to OPEC to drill the oil that we so des-
perately need. 
Because of skyrocketing inflation, 
American families are spending an 
extra $5,000 a year on everyday items. 
Right now, Americans are pulling up to 
the gas pump, and after filling their 
tank, they don’t have money to buy 
their kids lunch. 
To get our Nation back on track, we 
need to rely on American energy, not 
Saudi Arabia. We need to unleash 
American energy, and we need to re-
turn to American energy dominance. 
f 
STRIPPING AWAY WOMEN’S 
RIGHTS 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of women and their fun-
damental 
rights 
to 
reproductive 
healthcare.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6512 
July 14, 2022 
While MAGA Republicans want to rip 
away women’s rights, House Democrats 
remain committed to standing with 
women. We trust women. 
For a second time, we will vote to 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act to make the protections of Roe v. 
Wade the law of the land once again. 
House Democrats will also pass the En-
suring Women’s Right to Reproductive 
Freedom Act, which will prevent Re-
publicans from suing or fining women 
who travel across State lines to obtain 
an abortion. 
Trusting women to make their own 
personal healthcare decisions is what 
we believe as Democrats. Controlling 
women and stripping away their rights 
is what they are as Republicans. 
Democrats won’t give up the fight. 
We 
stand 
with 
women. 
We 
trust 
women. 
f 
WOODY’S LEGACY LIVES ON 
(Mrs. 
MILLER 
of 
West 
Virginia 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
World War II Medal of Honor recipient, 
West Virginia native Woody Williams, 
my dear friend. 
Woody was West Virginia’s hero, and 
he was America’s hero. He truly em-
bodied what it meant to be part of the 
Greatest Generation. 
Today, he will lie in honor in the 
United States Capitol. I can think of 
no better way to honor Woody’s life 
and legacy, as well as the memory of 
all of the World War II veterans, than 
allowing him this privilege. 
Woody will be sorely missed, but his 
legacy of service, dedication, and patri-
otism will live on in countless lives 
that he touched. 
f 
ERASING 50 YEARS OF PRECEDENT 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today as our Nation begins to 
grapple with the fall of Roe v. Wade. 
Twenty days ago, the Supreme Court 
erased 50 years of precedent, ending the 
freedom for women to have the right to 
choose. 
Already, the devastating effects are 
becoming very clear: State legislatures 
are 
criminalizing 
women 
and 
healthcare providers, pregnant cancer 
patients who cannot get the treatment 
they need to survive, a 10-year-old rape 
victim forced to travel across State 
lines to access the abortion she needs. 
It is horrific. But make no mistake, 
these stories are the result of a radical 
Republican agenda, and these are the 
stories that Republicans refuse to ac-
knowledge. We must call them out. 
This is an extremely difficult, per-
sonal decision, but I trust that women 
can make that choice, and I will do ev-
erything in my power to protect that 
right to choose. 
INFLATION HITS A 40-YEAR HIGH 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, just this week June’s inflation num-
bers hit a 40-year high at 9.1 percent, 
and average hourly earnings hit a new 
low. 
Instead of providing relief for Amer-
ican families and job creators, Demo-
crats are working on new tax increases. 
Amidst a potential economic recession 
and rampant inflation, this tax hike 
will crush Main Street America, im-
pacting 88,000 businesses just in Texas 
alone. 
As a small business owner for over 50 
years, I can tell you that Democrats’ 
out-of-touch policies are making it 
harder to operate a business. Inflation 
is making it more expensive to pur-
chase goods and make ends meet, and 
Democrats’ tax hike will further cut 
the operating margins, making it hard-
er to grow and compete. 
While the economy is struggling, we 
should be cutting taxes, not raising 
taxes. We must put an end to the 
Democrats’ tax-and-spend agenda and 
focus on building a stronger Main 
Street. 
Bottom 
line 
is, 
we 
need 
businesspeople in Washington. 
In God we trust. 
f 
HONORING DR. MAY EDWARD 
CHINN 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise in honor of the life and legacy of 
Harlem’s very own Dr. May Edward 
Chinn, a pioneer Black female physi-
cian in New York City. 
Dr. Chinn was the first Black woman 
to graduate from Bellevue Hospital’s 
Medical College in 1926, which is now 
known as New York University’s Gross-
man School of Medicine. She is also 
the first Black woman to complete an 
internship at Harlem Hospital in 1928. 
Dr. Chinn dedicated her life to serv-
ing others. Through her determination 
and hard work, she helped advance 
medical treatments for cancer screen-
ing that continue to save lives today. 
Like many of her predecessors, Dr. 
Chinn persisted and persevered. I am 
grateful to the Harlem Cultural Ar-
chives for its research to share this 
story, and I am honored to share the 
story of one of Harlem’s gems so that 
her work does not go unnoticed and her 
legacy does not remain anonymous. 
f 
WE MUST ADDRESS IMMIGRATION 
REFORM 
(Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, in my district a couple weeks 
ago there were 53 migrants found 
cooked to death in the back of a trail-
er. 
The Biden border crisis has continued 
to spiral out of control. 
If this body will not take notice now, 
when will it ever take notice? 
Out of those 53 migrants, half of 
them were from Mexico, half of them 
were from Guatemala, and a few others 
were from surrounding areas. 
This crisis continues to spiral. It con-
tinues to get worse. It is over 100 de-
grees in Texas today, and no one seems 
to care. No one seems to notice. Re-
gardless of their legal status, these 
people are oftentimes seeking eco-
nomic freedom, and yet they are dying 
in the back of trailers because no one 
in this body will address immigration 
reform and border security. 
f 
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH FREEDOM 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, ex-
tremists have waged an all-out war 
against reproductive health freedom, 
and American bodies are being used as 
political 
battlegrounds 
to 
advance 
their radical agenda. 
Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, 
Americans have overwhelmingly voiced 
their opposition, and we must not ig-
nore them. I am determined to defend 
reproductive healthcare rights of mil-
lions of Americans from all racial and 
socioeconomic backgrounds, and I im-
plore my colleagues to join me in the 
fight. 
A post-Roe America sets our coun-
try’s five decades of progress backward 
and 
threatens 
the 
health 
of 
marginalized communities who already 
face systemic barriers to accessing 
healthcare. Extremists have proven 
they will not stop until they have 
criminalized Americans for their right 
to take ownership of their reproductive 
health. 
It is time that we make Roe the law 
of the land. 
I urge our colleagues across the aisle 
to prioritize the will of the people and 
undo this grave injustice and protect it 
from being overturned in the future.

BIDEN’S MULTIEMPLOYER UNION 
BAILOUT 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker: ‘‘We turned 
a promise broken into a promise kept.’’ 
That is what President Biden said to 
union members and retirees about his 
bailout of union-run multiemployer 
pension plans. 
These plans need reform. But instead 
of reform, we got a bailout. Is this real-
ly a promise kept? 
The most recent bailout will disburse 
$90 billion to multiemployer pension 
plans. This is a short-term fix, one that 
fails to address the possibility of future

insolvency and hurts taxpayers in the 
process. 
It seems the left would rather dump 
taxpayer money into a broken multi-
employer pension system to appease 
unions than do the hard work of draft-
ing bipartisan legislation. 
In fulfilling this promise to his union 
buddies, President Biden ignored his 
responsibility to safeguard American 
taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, last time I checked, the 
President serves all Americans, not 
just union bosses. Perhaps his memory 
has failed him yet again. 
f 
WE MUST FIGHT TO RESTORE 
ABORTION RIGHTS 
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to express my pure outrage at 
this extremist, right-wing majority of 
the Supreme Court stripping one of the 
most important rights in this country 
away from people: the right to have an 
abortion. 
This 
decision 
endangers 
marginalized communities and strips 
the bodily autonomy away from mil-
lions of Americans, including my own 
17-year-old daughter. We must not rest 
until we restore people’s freedom to 
control their own bodies and their own 
decisions. 
I want to emphasize that abortion is 
still legal in Michigan. The very day 
that Roe was overturned in the Dobbs 
decision, our biggest health system, 
Beaumont-Spectrum, announced that 
they 
would 
end 
abortion 
services, 
counter to current Michigan law. 
I worked privately and publicly to re-
verse that, and, happily, they did so 
the same weekend. 
We will fight to restore abortion 
rights, to maintain them in all the 
States where they still exist. This is a 
fight for all of us, and it is up to us to 
protect everyone’s rights. 
f 
INFLATION IS A TAX ON ALL OF 
US 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
CLINE. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
sky-
rocketing prices are eating away at 
family budgets across the country; 8.3 
percent, 8.6 percent, and now 9.1 per-
cent—those were the inflation rates for 
April, May, and June of this year. Year 
over year, energy prices are up 34 per-
cent; gas, 48 percent; fuel oil, 106 per-
cent; electricity, 12 percent; meat, 
poultry, and eggs, 14 percent. 
But worse is the majority’s answer: 
Double down on Build Back Better and 
a tax-and-spend agenda that raises 
taxes on local businesses and farmers 
as our country enters a recession. 
While targeted stimulus during the 
COVID pandemic may have been appro-
priate, the plodding reaction of the 
Federal Reserve, combined with the 
typical reaction of the Democratic ma-
jority to spend trillions on Green New 
Deal projects and blue State bailouts, 
have caused paychecks to shrink and a 
lack of faith in the economic future of 
Americans to rise. 
Inflation is a tax on all of us. This 40- 
year high inflation rate is a wake-up 
call to return to fiscal sanity. Unfortu-
nately, no one needs a crystal ball to 
see that my friends on the other side of 
the aisle are busy hitting the snooze 
button once again on addressing this 
inflation crisis. 
f 
HONORING CONNIE DEEKEN 
WILLIAMS 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a constituent from my 
hometown, 
Anaheim, 
California: 
Connie Deeken Williams. 
Last month, Mrs. Williams cele-
brated her 110th birthday. Happy birth-
day to Connie. She is now the oldest 
resident in Orange County on record, 
and she is one of only 100 Americans 
alive today to reach that milestone. 
Mrs. Williams was born in 1912 and 
grew up on a farm in North Dakota 
with three siblings. During the 1918 
pandemic, she survived the Spanish flu. 
After graduating from high school, she 
moved across the country to Los Ange-
les, working as a maid and bookkeeper 
to help her brother pay rent. 
The United States has come a long 
way since 1912, and I have no doubt of 
our American ability to move forward 
just like Mrs. Williams has done every 
day of her life. 
Happy birthday to Connie. Happy 
birthday from all of us. 
f 
THE BIDEN PRICE HIKE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
time last year, President Biden told 
the American people that inflation was 
just temporary, just transitory, not a 
real big deal. The truth is hitting hard-
er than a Mayflower moving van escap-
ing California. 
Yesterday, the Consumer Price Index 
for June came in and the results are 
even worse than expected, at least by 
some. To real Americans, it is probably 
not a real surprise. 
The Biden administration’s economic 
policies have produced record inflation, 
a 41-year record, at 9.1 percent, and 
that is probably low to most Ameri-
cans. 
As inflation continues to skyrocket, 
wages have actually decreased. In fact, 
since President Biden took office, real 
wages have decreased by about 5 per-
cent. 
Across the Nation, Americans are 
dipping into their savings to stay on 
top of their increasing grocery and gas 
bills. 
Multiple polls show that Biden’s eco-
nomic crisis is the top issue for Ameri-
cans, and the vast majority of Ameri-
cans agree that the economy is in cri-
sis directly due to the administration’s 
failed policies. 
In fact, I held a telephone townhall 
last night with 70,000 callers from 
around my district joining in. Ninety 
percent responded in the poll saying 
that the economy is their top concern. 
The Biden administration needs to get 
with it. 
f 
GENERAL MILLEY NEEDS TO SET 
THE RECORD STRAIGHT 
(Mr. BANKS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, our Con-
stitution is clear: The President is the 
Commander in Chief. 
Sidestepping the President and vio-
lating the chain of command is a grave 
crime. 
According to Bob Woodward’s book 
‘‘Peril,’’ General Mark Milley directed 
senior military officials not to follow 
the President’s orders, unless General 
Milley approved them first. 
When I asked General Milley about 
‘‘Peril’’ at an Armed Services hearing, 
he claimed he hadn’t read it. 
Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY and I sent a 
letter to General Milley asking him to 
verify or refute the book’s claims. He 
hasn’t responded. 
I am calling on General Milley to set 
the record straight. General Milley is 
accused of secretly seizing the Presi-
dent’s military powers. That is the 
most serious crime. If he is innocent, 
he has a duty to say so.

CONGRATULATING DARREN 
CAMMAUF 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate an exceptional 
student athlete from my congressional 
district. 
Darren Cammauf, a recent graduate 
of Manheim Township School District, 
distinguished himself in track and field 
this past season, ultimately winning 
the 400-meter dash held at the Pennsyl-
vania Track and Field Coaches Asso-
ciation Indoor State Championship ear-
lier this year. 
A leading member of the Blue Streak 
Track and Field team, Cammauf had a 
successful senior season as well. 
He set a new school record for the 
best time in the 400-meter race. At the 
Lancaster-Lebanon League Champion-
ships, Darren won the 400- and 200- 
meter dashes as well as led the 1,600- 
meter relay team to victory. He capped 
his senior season off with a third-place 
victory in the 400-meter dash at the 
PIAA Class 3A competition. 
Darren will be attending St. Joseph’s 
University in Philadelphia to continue

gest cheerleaders: his mother, Erica,

a senior constituent advocate assisting 
residents of Pennsylvania’s 11th Con-

THE SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, a recent re-
port published by Republicans on the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
tells us exactly how the Biden adminis-
tration is fueling the southern border 
crisis and how that crisis is threat-
ening our national security. 
Border Patrol officials tell us two 
things drive immigration: economic 
opportunity and perception of U.S. im-
migration 
policy. 
By 
dismantling 
Trump administration policies, Presi-
dent Biden sent a message to millions 
of 
people, 
including 
transnational 
criminal organizations, that our bor-
ders are open. 
There have been 2.6 million migrant 
encounters since President Biden took 
the oath of office. We see a new record 
set every month. Still, the Biden ad-
ministration wants to end Title 42 and 
the remain in Mexico policy. 
Additionally, 
on 
this 
President’s 
watch, Border Patrol officials have also 
seized more than 1 million pounds of il-
legal drugs. Overdose deaths in this 
country are at an all-time high. The 
President must enforce our laws and 
save American lives. 
f 
HONORING POLICE CHIEF MICHAEL 
INSERRA 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate my good 
friend, former New Hartford Police 
Chief Michael Inserra, who retired at 
the end of June after an absolutely in-
credible career. 
Michael has served our local commu-
nities in law enforcement over 40 years. 
Born and raised in my hometown of 
New Hartford, New York, Michael 
started out in 1982 with the Whitestown 
Police Department and quickly moved 
to the town of Kirkland Police Depart-
ment. In 1988, Michael made his big 
move to the New Hartford Police De-
partment to start a new career in law 
enforcement where he would serve for 
another 34 years. 
Inserra was a sergeant in the depart-
ment during one of the most chal-
lenging times in its history, during the 
line-of-duty death of Officer Joseph 
Corr. Inserra played a key role in ap-
prehending the suspects and helping 
the department and community navi-
gate the horrible tragedy and after-
math. 
In 2010, Inserra was named chief of 
the New Hartford Police Department. 
Shortly after taking charge, the de-
partment made immediate changes, in-
cluding modernizing its IT equipment, 
adding computers to all of their patrol 
cars, testing body cameras for their of-
ficers, and joining social media, which 
Inserra said helped strengthen the bond 
with the community. 
To this day, Michael Inserra gives 
credit to the department for their con-
tinued success, commending them for 
professionalism and unwavering dedi-
cation to duty. 
I thank Chief Inserra for his lifetime 
of service and commitment to the town 
of New Hartford. Our communities are 
grateful for his many years of service 
as is the New Hartford Police Depart-
ment, which continues to thrive from 
his insight.

WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS ARE 
FUELING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
as families are forced to make tough fi-
nancial decisions every day because of 
sky-high inflation, Washington Demo-
crats are fueling the economic crisis by 
spending hundreds of billions of dollars 
to advance their radical agenda. 
But that is just the spending they are 
trying to pass through Congress. Presi-
dent Biden is using executive actions 
to secretly put his radical agenda in 
place, footing taxpayers with a $532 bil-
lion bill without any input of Congress. 
He spent $85 billion to continue a 
pandemic-era student loan payment 
moratorium benefiting higher-income 
earners. He put $11 billion down the 
drain 
by

Instead of spending half a trillion 
dollars on things like reducing work 
incentives and giving handouts to the 
wealthy, President Biden needs to get 
serious about solving the significant

culture, and the Secretary of the Interior, 
and after consideration of the results of best 
available scientific findings of practices and 
behaviors occurring at the source of zoonoses 
spillover and spread, shall publicly release a 
list of countries the governments of which 
express willingness to end the domestic and 
international commercial trade in live wild-
life and associated wildlife markets for 
human consumption, as defined for purposes 
of this title— 
(1) immediately; 
(2) after a transitional period; and 
(3) aspirationally, over a long-term period.

tion immediately, during a transitional pe-
riod, or aspirationally, shall be reviewed, up-
dated, and publicly released annually by the 
Secretary and Administrator, following re-
view of the most recent scientific data. 
SEC. 5903. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that global in-
stitutions, including the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of the United Nations, 
the World Organisation for Animal Health, 
the World Health Organization, and the 
United Nations Environment Programme, 
together with leading intergovernmental and 
nongovernmental organizations, veterinary 
and medical colleges, the Department of 
State, and the United States Agency for 
International Development, should— 
(1) promote the paradigm of One Health as 
an effective and integrated way to address 
the complexity of emerging disease threats; 
and 
(2) support improved community health, 
biodiversity conservation, forest conserva-
tion and management, sustainable agri-
culture, and the safety of livestock, domestic 
animals, and wildlife in developing coun-
tries, particularly in tropical landscapes 
where there is an elevated risk of zoonotic 
disease spill over. 
SEC. 5904. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to— 
(1) support the availability of scalable and 
sustainable alternative sources of protein 
and nutrition for local communities, where 
appropriate, in order to minimize human re-
liance on the commercial trade in live wild-
life for human consumption; 
(2) support foreign governments to— 
(A) reduce commercial trade in live wild-
life for human consumption; 
(B) transition from the commercial trade 
in live wildlife for human consumption to 
sustainably produced alternate protein and 
nutritional sources; 
(C) establish and effectively manage and 
protect natural habitat, including protected 
and conserved areas and the lands of Indige-
nous peoples and local communities, particu-
larly 
in 
countries 
with 
tropical 
forest 
hotspots for emerging diseases; 
(D) strengthen veterinary and agricultural 
extension capacity to improve sanitation 
along the value chain and biosecurity of live 
animal markets; and 
(E) strengthen public health capacity, par-
ticularly in countries where there is a high 
risk of emerging zoonotic viruses and other 
infectious diseases; 
(3) respect the rights and needs of indige-
nous peoples and local communities depend-
ent on such wildlife for nutritional needs and 
food security; and 
(4) facilitate international cooperation by 
working with international partners through 
intergovernmental, international, and non-
governmental organizations such as the 
United Nations to— 
(A) lead a resolution at the United Nations 
Security Council or General Assembly and 
World Health Assembly outlining the danger 
to human and animal health from emerging 
zoonotic 
infectious 
diseases, 
with 
rec-
ommendations for implementing the closure 
of wildlife markets and prevention of the 
commercial trade in live wildlife for human 
consumption, except where the consumption 
of wildlife is necessary for local food secu-
rity or where such actions would signifi-
cantly disrupt a readily available and irre-
placeable food supply; 
(B) raise awareness and build stakeholder 
engagement networks, including civil soci-
ety, the private sector, and local and re-
gional governments on the dangerous poten-
tial of wildlife markets as a source of 
zoonotic diseases and reduce demand for the 
consumption of wildlife through evidence- 
based behavior change programs, while en-
suring that existing wildlife habitat is not 
encroached upon or destroyed as part of this 
process; 
(C) encourage and support alternative 
forms of sustainable food production, farm-
ing, and shifts to sustainable sources of pro-
tein and nutrition instead of terrestrial wild-
life, where able and appropriate, and reduce 
consumer demand for terrestrial and fresh-
water wildlife through enhanced local and 
national food systems, especially in areas 
where wildlife markets play a significant 
role in meeting subsistence needs while en-
suring that existing wildlife habitat is not 
encroached upon or destroyed as part of this 
process; and 
(D) strive to increase biosecurity and hygi-
enic standards implemented in farms, gath-
ering centers, transport, and market systems 
around the globe, especially those special-
izing in the provision of products intended 
for human consumption. 
SEC. 5905. PREVENTION OF FUTURE ZOONOTIC 
SPILLOVER EVENT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State 
and the Administrator of the United States 
Agency for International Development, in 
consultation with the Director of the United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Sec-
retary of Agriculture, the Director of the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
and the heads of other relevant departments 
and agencies, shall work with foreign gov-
ernments, multilateral entities, intergovern-
mental organizations, international part-
ners, private sector partners, and nongovern-
mental organizations to carry out activities 
supporting the following objectives, recog-
nizing that multiple interventions will like-
ly be necessary to make an impact, and that 
interventions will need to be tailored to the 
situation to— 
(1) pursuant to section 5902, close wildlife 
markets and prevent associated commercial 
trade in live wildlife, placing a priority focus 
on countries with significant markets for 
live wildlife for human consumption, high- 
volume commercial trade and associated 
markets, trade in and across urban centers, 
and trade for luxury consumption or where 
there is no dietary necessity— 
(A) through existing treaties, conventions, 
and agreements; 
(B) by amending existing protocols or 
agreements; 
(C) by pursuing new protocols; or 
(D) by other means of international coordi-
nation; 
(2) improve regulatory oversight and re-
duce commercial trade in live wildlife and 
eliminate practices identified to contribute 
to zoonotic spillover and emerging patho-
gens; 
(3) prevent commercial trade in live wild-
life through programs that combat wildlife 
trafficking and poaching, including— 
(A) providing assistance to improve law en-
forcement; 
(B) detecting and deterring the illegal im-
port, transit, sale, and export of wildlife; 
(C) strengthening such programs to assist 
countries through legal reform; 
(D) improving information sharing and en-
hancing capabilities of participating foreign 
governments; 
(E) supporting efforts to change behavior 
and reduce demand for such wildlife prod-
ucts; 
(F) leveraging United States private sector 
technologies and expertise to scale and en-
hance enforcement responses to detect and 
prevent such trade; and 
(G) strengthening collaboration with key 
private sector entities in the transportation 
industry to prevent and report the transport 
of such wildlife and wildlife products; 
(4) leverage strong United States bilateral 
relationships to support new and existing 
inter-Ministerial 
collaborations 
or 
Task 
Forces that can serve as regional One Health 
models; 
(5) build local agricultural and food safety 
capacity by leveraging expertise from the 
United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) and institutions of higher education 
with agricultural or natural resource exper-
tise; 
(6) work through international organiza-
tions to help develop a set of objective risk- 
based metrics that provide a cross-country 
comparable measure of the level of risk 
posed by wildlife trade and marketing and 
can be used to track progress nations make 
in reducing risks, identify where resources 
should be focused, and potentially leverage a 
peer influence effect; 
(7) increase efforts to prevent the degrada-
tion and fragmentation of forests and other 
intact ecosystems to minimize interactions 
between wildlife and human and livestock 
populations that could contribute to spill-
over events and zoonotic disease trans-
mission, including by providing assistance or 
supporting policies to, for example— 
(A) conserve, protect, and restore the in-
tegrity of such ecosystems; 
(B) support the rights and needs of Indige-
nous People and local communities and their

SEC. 1236. CONDEMNING DETENTION AND IN-
DICTMENT OF RUSSIAN OPPOSITION 
LEADER VLADIMIR VLADIMIROVICH 
KARA-MURZA. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza 
(referred to in this section as ‘‘Mr. Kara- 
Murza’’) has tirelessly worked for decades to 
advance the cause of freedom, democracy, 
and human rights for the people of the Rus-
sian Federation. 
(2) In retaliation for his advocacy, two at-
tempts have been made on Mr. Kara-Murza’s 
life, as— 
(A) on May 26, 2015, Mr. Kara-Murza fell ill 
with symptoms indicative of poisoning and 
was hospitalized; and 
(B) on February 2, 2017, he fell ill with 
similar symptoms and was placed in a medi-
cally induced coma. 
(3) Independent investigations conducted 
by Bellingcat, the Insider, and Der Spiegel 
found that the same unit of the Federal Se-
curity Service of the Russian Federation re-
sponsible for poisoning Mr. Kara-Murza was 
responsible for poisoning Russian opposition 
leader Alexei Navalny and activists Timur 
Kuashev, 
Ruslan 
Magomedragimov, 
and 
Nikita Isayev. 
(4) On February 24, 2022, Vladimir Putin 
launched another unprovoked, unjustified, 
and illegal invasion into Ukraine in con-
travention of the obligations freely under-
taken by the Russian Federation to respect 
the territorial integrity of Ukraine under 
the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, the 
Minsk protocols of 2014 and 2015, and inter-
national law. 
(5) On March 5, 2022, Vladimir Putin signed 
a law criminalizing the distribution of truth-
ful statements about the invasion of Ukraine 
by the Russian Federation and mandating up 
to 15 years in prison for such offenses. 
(6) Since February 24, 2022, Mr. Kara-Murza 
has used his voice and platform to join more 
than 15,000 citizens of the Russian Federa-
tion in peacefully protesting the war against 
Ukraine and millions more who silently op-
pose the war. 
(7) On April 11, 2022, five police officers ar-
rested Mr. Kara-Murza in front of his home 
and denied his right to an attorney, and the 
next day Mr. Kara-Murza was sentenced to 15 
days in prison for disobeying a police order. 
(8) On April 22, 2022, the Investigative Com-
mittee of the Russian Federation charged 
Mr. Kara-Murza with violations under the 
law signed on March 5, 2022, for his fact- 
based statements condemning the invasion 
of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. 
(9) Mr. Kara-Murza was then placed into 
pretrial detention and ordered to be held 
until at least June 12, 2022. 
(10) If convicted of those charges, Mr. 
Kara-Murza faces detention in a penitentiary 
system that human rights nongovernmental 
organizations have criticized for widespread 
torture, ill-treatment, and suspicious deaths 
of prisoners.

the following: 
SEC. 13l. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE 
BOYCOTT OF CERTAIN COMPANIES 
THAT CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN 
RUSSIA AND PROVIDE FINANCIAL 
BENEFITS TO THE PUTIN REGIME. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) On February 24, 2022, the Government of 
Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, invaded the 
sovereign country of Ukraine under the di-
rection of the President of the Russian Fed-
eration Vladimir Putin. 
(2) On March 6, 2022, Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken stated that the United 
States has seen credible reports of Russia en-
gaging in ‘‘deliberate attacks on civilians, 
which would constitute a war crime’’. 
(3) On March 16, 2022, Ukrainian President 
Zelenskyy urged ‘‘All American companies 
must leave Russia . . . leave their market 
immediately, because it is flooded with 
[Ukrainian] blood’’. 
(4) 
In 
the 
same 
speech, 
President 
Zelenskyy called on Congress to lead by 
pressuring companies ‘‘who finance the Rus-
sian military machine’’ and conduct ‘‘busi-
ness in Russia’’ and to ‘‘make sure that the 
Russians do not receive a single penny that 
they use to destroy people in Ukraine’’. 
(5) Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of 
Management has compiled a list of some 
1,000 companies which have withdrawn per-
manently or temporarily from Russia. 
(6) By refusing to reduce, cease, or with-
draw operations in Russia, these companies 
which have not withdrawn permanently or 
temporarily from Russia contribute to un-
dermining the sanctions imposed by the 
United States and its allies that are intended 
to deter further Russian aggression. 
(7) A number of United States and multi-
national companies that do business in Rus-
sia do not provide life-saving or health-re-
lated goods and services to the Russian peo-
ple and contribute to Putin’s ability to wage 
war in Ukraine and continue to commit war 
crimes by providing revenue for the Russian 
Government. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—Congress— 
(1) supports and encourages Americans who 
choose to exercise their free speech rights by 
boycotting companies that do not provide 
life-saving or health-related goods and serv-
ices to the Russian people yet continue to 
operate in Russia; 
(2) condemns companies that continue to 
operate in Russia and provide financial bene-
fits to the Putin regime that enable his abil-
ity to continue waging war in Ukraine; and 
(3) commends companies that have already 
suspended operations in or withdrawn from 
markets in Russia in response to the Putin 
regime’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine.

AMENDMENT NO. 557 OFFERED BY MR. LEVIN OF 
MICHIGAN 
At the appropriate place in title LVIII, in-
sert the following: 
SEC. ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS AND STATEMENT 
OF POLICY ON HAITI. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Since 2018, the ruling PHTK has pre-
sided over increasing instability, displace-
ment, and poverty in Haiti stemming from, 
among other reasons— 
(A) systematic dismantlement of the judi-
cial system; 
(B) a non-functioning parliamentary sys-
tem; 
(C) mass gang violence against civilians 
and between gangs resulting in large-scale 
massacres; 
(D) gang rule of large parts of Haiti; daily 
kidnappings for ransom; 
(E) widespread sexual violence against 
women, girls and marginalized people; 
(F) grand corruption; 
(G) state violence against protesters; 
(H) unsafe conditions for workers; 
(I) diminished access to water, food, 
healthcare and education; and 
(J) unnatural devastation from natural dis-
asters. 
(2) Government-supported violence in Haiti 
has forced large numbers of Haitians to flee 
the country, including to the United States. 
(3) Independent human rights organiza-
tions and the media have documented PHTK 
collusion with gang activity through— 
(A) the participation of PHTK officials in 
gang attacks; 
(B) the use of police vehicles in gang ac-
tivities; and 
(C) systemic refusals by the police to inter-
fere in gang attacks and the justice system 
to prosecute gang members and government 
officials credibly accused of participating in 
massacres. 
(4) In 2021, the United States together with 
the 
international 
community 
installed 
PHTK official Ariel Henry as the Prime Min-
ister and thus de facto head of Government 
of Haiti following the assassination of Presi-
dent Jovenel Moise. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the security, freedom, and 
well-being of Haitians are intertwined with 
that of the people of the United States, and 
United States interests are not served by an 
unstable or unsafe Haiti. 
(c) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States— 
(1) to support a Haitian-led solution to the 
current crisis; 
(2) that the people of Haiti must be empow-
ered to choose their leaders and govern Haiti 
free from foreign interference; and

July 14, 2022 
democratic reforms in Burma, with elections 
in 2010, 2015, and 2020, helping to bring about 
the partial transition to civilian rule and 
with the latter 2 elections resulting in re-
sounding electoral victories for the National 
League for Democracy. 
(2) That democratic transition remained 
incomplete, with the military retaining sig-
nificant power and independence from civil-
ian control following the 2015 elections, in-
cluding through control of 25 percent of par-
liamentary seats, a de facto veto over con-
stitutional reform, authority over multiple 
government ministries, and the ability to op-
erate with impunity and no civilian over-
sight. 
(3) Despite some improvements with re-
spect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms beginning in 2010, and the estab-
lishment of a quasi-civilian government fol-
lowing credible elections in 2015, Burma’s 
military leaders have, since 2016, overseen an 
increase in restrictions to freedom of expres-
sion (including for members of the press), 
freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of as-
sociation, and freedom of religion or belief. 
(4) On August 25, 2017, Burmese military 
and security forces launched a genocidal 
military campaign against Rohingya, result-
ing in a mass exodus of some 750,000 
Rohingya from Burma’s Rakhine State into 
Bangladesh, where they remain. The mili-
tary has since taken no steps to improve 
conditions for Rohingya still in Rakhine 
State, who remain at high risk of genocide 
and other atrocities, or to create conditions 
conducive 
to 
the 
voluntary 
return 
of 
Rohingya refugees and other internally dis-
placed persons (IDPs). 
(5) The Burmese military has also engaged 
in renewed violence with other ethnic minor-
ity groups across the country. The military 
has continued to commit atrocities in Chin, 
Kachin, Kayah, and Shan. Fighting in north-
ern Burma has forced more than 100,000 peo-
ple from their homes and into camps for in-
ternally displaced persons. The Burmese 
military continues to heavily proscribe hu-
manitarian and media access to conflict-af-
fected populations across the country. 
(6) With more nearly $470,000,000 in human-
itarian assistance in response to the crisis in 
fiscal year 2021, the United States is the 
largest humanitarian donor to populations 
in need as a result of conflicts in Burma. In 
May 2021, the United States announced near-
ly $155,000,000 in additional humanitarian as-
sistance to meet the 
urgent 
needs 
of 
Rohingya refugees and host communities in 
Bangladesh and people affected by ongoing 
violence in Burma’s Rakhine, Kachin, Shan, 
and Chin states. In September 2021, the 
United States provided nearly $180,000,000 in 
additional critical humanitarian assistance 
to the people of Burma, bringing the total 
fiscal year 2021 to more than $434,000,000. 
(7) Both government- and military-initi-
ated investigations into human rights abuses 
in Burma involving violence between ethnic 
minorities and Burmese security forces have 
failed to yield credible results or hold per-
petrators accountable. 
(8) In its report dated September 17, 2018, 
the 
United 
Nations 
Independent 
Inter-
national Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar 
concluded, on reasonable grounds, that the 
factors allowing inference of ‘‘genocidal in-
tent’’ are present with respect to the attacks 
against Rohingya in Rakhine State, and acts 
by Burmese security forces against Rohingya 
in Rakhine State and other ethnic minori-
ties in Kachin and Shan States amount to 
‘‘crimes 
against 
humanity’’ 
and 
‘‘war 
crimes’’. 
The 
Independent 
International 
Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar estab-
lished by the United Nations Human Rights 
Council recommended that the United Na-
tions Security Council ‘‘should ensure ac-
countability for crimes under international 
law committed in Myanmar, preferably by 
referring the situation to the International 
Criminal Court or alternatively by creating 
an ad hoc international criminal tribunal’’. 
The Mission also recommended the imposi-
tion of targeted economic sanctions, includ-
ing an arms embargo on Burma. 
(9) On December 13, 2018, the United States 
House of Representatives passed House Reso-
lution 1091 (115th Congress), which expressed 
the sense of the House that ‘‘the atrocities 
committed against the Rohingya by the Bur-
mese military and security forces since Au-
gust 2017 constitute crimes against human-
ity and genocide’’ and called upon the Sec-
retary of State to review the available evi-
dence and make a similar determination. 
(10) In a subsequent report dated August 5, 
2019, the United Nations Independent Inter-
national Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar 
found that the Burmese military’s economic 
interests ‘‘enable its conduct’’ and that it 
benefits from and supports extractive indus-
try businesses operating in conflict-affected 
areas in northern Burma, including natural 
resources, particularly oil and gas, minerals 
and gems and argued that ‘‘through control-
ling its own business empire, the Tatmadaw 
can evade the accountability and oversight 
that normally arise from civilian oversight 
of military budgets’’. The report called for 
the United Nations and individual govern-
ments to place targeted sanctions on all sen-
ior officials in the Burmese military as well 
as 
their 
economic 
interests, 
especially 
Myanma Economic Holdings Limited and 
Myanmar Economic Corporation. 
(11) Burma’s November 2020 election re-
sulted in a landslide victory for the National 
League of Democracy, with the National 
League for Democracy winning a large ma-
jority of seats in Burma’s national par-
liament. The elections were judged to be 
credible, and marked an important step in 
the country’s democratic transition. 
(12) On February 1, 2021, the Burmese mili-
tary conducted a coup d’e´tat, declaring a 
year-long state of emergency and detaining 
State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, Presi-
dent Win Myint, and dozens of other govern-
ment officials and elected members of par-
liament, thus derailing Burma’s transition 
to democracy and disregarding the will of 
the people of Burma as expressed in the No-
vember 2020 general elections, which were 
determined to be credible by international 
and national observers. 
(13) Following the coup, some ousted mem-
bers of parliament established the Com-
mittee 
Representing 
the 
Pyidaungsu 
Hluttaw (CRPH), which subsequently estab-
lished 
the 
National 
Unity 
Consultative 
Council in March of 2021. The National Unity 
Consultative Council includes representa-
tives from a broad spectrum of stakeholders 
in Burma opposed to the military and the 
coup: 
elected 
representatives 
from 
the 
CRPH, 
representatives 
from 
the 
ethnic 
armed organizations, members of Burma’s 
civil disobedience movement, and other anti- 
coup forces. 
(14) The CRPH subsequently released the 
Federal Democracy Charter in March 2021 
and established the National Unity Govern-
ment in April 2021. The National Unity Gov-
ernment includes representatives from eth-
nic minority groups, civil society organiza-
tions, women’s groups, leaders of the civil 
disobedience movement, and others. 
(15) Since the coup on February 1, 2021, the 
Burmese military has— 
(A) used lethal force on peaceful protestors 
on multiple occasions, killing more than 
2,000 people, including more than 142 chil-
dren; 
(B) detained more than 10,000 peaceful 
protestors, participants in the Civil Disobe-
dience Movement, labor leaders, government 
officials and elected members of parliament, 
members of the media, and others, according 
to the Assistance Association for Political 
Prisoners; 
(C) issued laws and directives used to fur-
ther impede fundamental freedoms, includ-
ing freedom of expression (including for 
members of the press), freedom of peaceful 
assembly, and freedom of association; and 
(D) imposed restrictions on the internet 
and telecommunications. 
(16) According to the UNHCR, more than 
758,000 people have been internally displaced 
since the coup, while an estimated 40,000 
have sought refuge in neighboring countries. 
Nevertheless, the Burmese military con-
tinues to block humanitarian assistance to 
populations in need. According to the World 
Health Organization, the military has car-
ried out more than 286 attacks on health 
care entities since the coup and killed at 
least 30 health workers. Dozens more have 
been arbitrarily detained, and hundreds have 
warrants out for their arrest. The military 
continued such attacks even as they inhib-
ited efforts to combat a devastating third 
wave of COVID–19. The brutality of the Bur-
mese military was on full display on March 
27, 2021, Armed Forces Day, when, after 
threatening on state television to shoot pro-
testers in the head, security forces killed 
more than 150 people. 
(17) The coup represents a continuation of 
a long pattern of violent and anti-demo-
cratic 
behavior 
by 
the 
military 
that 
stretches back decades, with the military 
having previously taken over Burma in 
coups d’e´tat in 1962 and 1988, and having ig-
nored the results of the 1990 elections, and a 
long history of violently repressing protest 
movements, including killing and impris-
oning thousands of peaceful protestors dur-
ing pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988 
and 2007. 
(18) On February 11, 2021, President Biden 
issued Executive Order 14014 in response to 
the 
coup 
d’e´tat, 
authorizing 
sanctions 
against the Burmese military, its economic 
interests, and other perpetrators of the coup. 
(19) Since the issuance of Executive Order 
14014, President Biden has taken several 
steps to impose costs on the Burmese mili-
tary and its leadership, including by desig-
nating or otherwise imposing targeted sanc-
tions with respect to— 
(A) multiple high-ranking individuals and 
their family members, including the Com-
mander-in-Chief of the Burmese military, 
Min Aung Hlaing, Burma’s Chief of Police, 
Than Hlaing, and the Bureau of Special Op-
erations commander, Lieutenant General 
Aung Soe, and over 35 other individuals; 
(B) state-owned and military controlled 
companies, including Myanma Economic 
Holdings Public Company, Ltd., Myanmar 
Economic Corporation, Ltd., Myanmar Eco-
nomic Holdings Ltd., Myanmar Ruby Enter-
prise, Myanmar Imperial Jade Co., Ltd., and 
Myanma Gems Enterprise; and 
(C) other corporate entities, Burmese mili-
tary units, and Burmese military entities, 
including the military regime’s State Ad-
ministrative Council. 
(20) The United States has also imple-
mented new restrictions on exports and reex-
ports to Burma pursuant to Executive Order 
14014; and 
(21) On April 24, 2021, the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed to 
a five-point consensus which called for an 
‘‘immediate cessation of violence’’, ‘‘con-
structive dialogue among all parties’’, the 
appointment of an ASEAN special envoy, the 
provision 
of 
humanitarian 
assistance 
through ASEAN’s AHA Centre, and a visit by 
the ASEAN special envoy to Burma. Except 
for the appointment of the Special Envoy in

August 2021, the other elements of the 
ASEAN consensus remain unimplemented 
due to obstruction by the Burmese military. 
(22) In June 2021, the National Unity Gov-
ernment included ethnic minorities and 
women among its cabinet and released a pol-
icy paper outlining pledges to Rohingya and 
calling for ‘‘justice and reparations’’ for the 
community. 
The 
statement 
affirms 
the 
Rohingya right to citizenship in Burma, a 
significant break from past Burmese govern-
ment policies. 
(23) On March 21, 2022, Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken announced that the United 
States had concluded that ‘‘members of the 
Burmese military committed genocide and 
crimes against humanity against Rohingya’’. 
SEC. 5912. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

ethnic Rohingya, Shan, Rakhine, Kachin,

groups and leads to the development of a po-
litical system that effectively addresses nat-
ural resource governance, revenue-sharing, 
land rights, and constitutional change ena-
bling inclusive peace; 
(11) to ensure the protection and non- 
refoulement of refugees fleeing Burma to 
neighboring countries and prioritize efforts 
to create a conducive environment and 
meaningfully address long-standing struc-

and rights of Rohingya in Rakhine State as 
well as members of other ethnic and reli-
gious minorities in Burma, including by pro-
moting the creation of conditions for the 
dignified, safe, sustainable, and voluntary re-
turn of refugees in Bangladesh, Thailand, 
and in the surrounding region when condi-
tions allow; 
(12) to support an immediate end to re-
strictions that hinder the freedom of move-
ment of members of ethnic minorities 
throughout the country, including Rohingya, 
and an end to any and all policies and prac-
tices 
designed 
to 
forcibly 
segregate 
Rohingya, and providing humanitarian sup-
port for all internally displaced persons in 
Burma; 
(13) to support unfettered access for hu-
manitarian actors, media, and human rights 
mechanisms, including those established by 
the United Nations Human Rights Council 
and the United Nations General Assembly, to 
all relevant areas of Burma, including 
Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Shan, and Kayin 
States, as well as Sagaing and Magway re-
gions; 
(14) to call for accountability through inde-
pendent, credible investigations and prosecu-
tions for any potential genocide, war crimes, 
and crimes against humanity, including

calibrated 
engagement,

targeted 
sanctions with respect to the Burmese mili-

of income for the Burmese military, includ-
ing with respect to— 
(A) officials in Burma, including the Com-
mander in Chief of the Armed Forces of 
Burma, Min Aung Hlaing, and all individuals 
described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of sec-
tion 202(a), under the authorities provided by 
title II, Executive Order 14014, and the Glob-
al Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability 
Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114– 
328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note); 
(B) enterprises owned or controlled by the 
Burmese military, including the Myanmar 
Economic Corporation, Union of Myanmar

(ii) the imposition of sanctions would not 
cause disproportionate harm to the people of 
Burma, the restoration of a civilian govern-
ment in Burma, or the national interest of 
the United States; and 
(20) to ensure that any sanctions imposed 
with respect to entities or individuals are 
carefully targeted to maximize impact on 
the military and security forces of Burma 
and its economic interests while minimizing 
impact on the people of Burma, recognizing 
the calls from the people of Burma for the 
United States to take action against the 
sources of income for the military and secu-
rity forces of Burma.

TIONS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO 
BURMA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United Nations Security Council 
has not taken adequate steps to condemn the 
February 1, 2021, coup in Burma, pressure the 
Burmese military to cease its violence 
against civilians, or secure the release of 
those unjustly detained; and 
(2) countries, such as the People’s Republic 
of China and the Russian Federation, that 
are directly or indirectly shielding the Bur-
mese military from international scrutiny 
and action, should be obliged to endure the 
reputational damage of doing so by taking 
public votes on resolutions related to Burma 
that apply greater pressure on the Burmese 
military to restore Burma to its democratic 
path. 
(3) The United Nations Secretariat and the 
United Nations Security Council should take 
concrete steps to address the coup and ongo-
ing crisis in Burma consistent with the UN 
General Assembly resolution 75/287, ‘‘The sit-
uation in Myanmar,’’ which was adopted on 
June 18, 2021.

FOR
GREATER
ACTION.—The 
President shall direct the United States Per-
manent Representative to the United Na-
tions to use the voice, vote, and influence of

the United Nations and the United Nations 
Security Council with respect to Burma by— 
(1) pushing the United Nations Security 
Council to consider a resolution condemning 
the February 1, 2021, coup and calling on the 
Burmese military to cease its violence 
against the people of Burma and release 
without preconditions the journalists, pro- 
democracy activists, and political officials 
that it has unjustly detained; 
(2) pushing the United Nations Security 
Council to consider a resolution that imme-
diately imposes a global arms embargo 
against Burma to ensure that the Burmese 
military is not able to obtain weapons and 
munitions from other nations to further 
harm, murder, and oppress the people of 
Burma; 
(3) pushing the United Nations and other 
United Nations authorities to cut off assist-
ance to the Government of Burma while pro-
viding humanitarian assistance directly to 
the people of Burma through UN bodies and 
civil society organizations, particularly such 
organizations working with ethnic minori-
ties that have been adversely affected by the 
coup and the Burmese military’s violent 
crackdown; 
(4) objecting to the appointment of rep-
resentatives to the United Nations and 
United Nations bodies such as the Human 
Rights Council that are sanctioned by the 
Burmese military; 
(5) working to ensure the Burmese military 
is not recognized as the legitimate govern-
ment of Burma in any United Nations body; 
and 
(6) spurring the United Nations Security 
Council to consider multilateral sanctions 
against the Burmese military for its atroc-
ities against Rohingya and individuals of 
other ethnic and religious minorities, its 
coup, and the crimes against humanity it 
has and continues to commit in the coup’s 
aftermath.

mits to the appropriate congressional com-
mittees a certification that— 
(1) the Burmese military has released all 
political prisoners taken into custody on or 
after February 1, 2021, or is providing legal 
recourse to those that remain in custody; 
(2) the elected government has been rein-
stated or new free and fair elections have 
been held; 
(3) all legal charges against those winning 
election in November 2020 are dropped; and 
(4) the 2008 constitution of Burma has been 
amended or replaced to place the Burmese 
military under civilian oversight and ensure

ass, and silence community leaders and

AMENDMENT NO. 616 OFFERED BY MR. SCHNEIDER 
OF ILLINOIS 
At the end of title LVIII, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 58ll. POLICY REGARDING DEVELOPMENT 
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY IRAN. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Congress and several successive Presi-
dential administrations have long sought to 
prevent Iran from ever acquiring a nuclear 
weapon. 
(2) It is currently estimated that Iran is al-
most to the point of having enough highly- 
enriched nuclear material to produce a nu-
clear weapon, if further enriched. 
(3) On March 3, 2020, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director Gen-
eral reported to the Agency’s Board of Gov-
ernors that nuclear material was found at 
three previously undisclosed locations in 
Iran. 
(4) The IAEA reported it began inves-
tigating this matter pursuant to Iran’s IAEA 
safeguards obligations in 2019. 
(5) On March 5, 2022, the IAEA and the 
Atomic Energy Organization of Iran an-
nounced an agreement wherein Iran com-
mitted to provide the IAEA with information 
and documents in response to the IAEA’s 
questions related to uranium particles dis-
covered at undeclared sites in Iran. 
(6) On June 6, 2022, the Director General of 
the IAEA stated that ‘‘Iran has not provided 
explanations that are technically credible in 
relation to the Agency’s findings at three 
undeclared locations in Iran. Nor has Iran in-
formed the Agency of the current location, 
or locations, of the nuclear material and/or 
of the equipment contaminated with nuclear 
material, that was moved from Turquzabad 
in 2018.’’. 
(7) On June 8, 2022, the IAEA Board of Gov-
ernors overwhelmingly adopted a resolution 
calling on Iran to cooperate with the IAEA 
on an urgent basis to fulfil its safeguards ob-
ligations and expressing profound concern 
with Iran’s insufficient substantive coopera-
tion thus far, with 30 Board Members voting 
in favor, two voting against, and three ab-
staining. 
(8) The IAEA Board of Governors’s resolu-
tion called upon Iran to ‘‘act on an urgent 
basis to fulfill its legal obligations and, 
without delay, take up the Director Gen-
eral’s offer of further engagement to clarify 
and 
resolve 
all 
outstanding 
safeguards 
issues.’’. 
(9) Shortly before the IAEA Board of 
Governors’s vote adopting the resolution, 
Iran announced it would remove 27 IAEA 
cameras installed to monitor the separate 
issue of Iran’s JCPOA commitments at cer-
tain Iranian facilities and Iran has since fol-
lowed through on disconnecting these cam-
eras. 
(10) Following the vote of the IAEA Board 
of Governors, Iran informed the IAEA it 
would install additional cascades of ad-
vanced IR-6 centrifuges at its Natanz facil-
ity; 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that it— 
(1) reiterates its commitment to ensuring 
Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon; 
(2) supports the important work of the 
IAEA 
in 
safeguarding 
nuclear 
material 
around the globe; 
(3) condemns Iran for its lack of trans-
parency and meaningful cooperation with 
the IAEA on the unresolved matter of ura-
nium particles discovered at undeclared sites 
in Iran and additional escalatory actions re-
lated to its nuclear program; and 
(4) applauds the IAEA Board of Governors’ 
resolution urging Iran’s full cooperation 
with the IAEA on outstanding safeguards 
issues on an urgent basis.

SEC. 5403. REVIEW OF FHA SMALL-DOLLAR MORT-
GAGE PRACTICES. 
(a) CONGRESSIONAL
FINDINGS.—The Con-
gress finds that— 
(1) affordable homeownership opportunities 
are being hindered due to the lack of financ-
ing available for home purchases under 
$100,000; 
(2) according to the Urban Institute, small- 
dollar mortgage loan applications in 2017 
were denied by lenders at double the rate of 
denial for large mortgage loans, and this dif-
ference in denial rates cannot be fully ex-
plained by differences in the applicants’ 
credit profiles; 
(3) according to data compiled by Attom 
Data solutions, small-dollar mortgage origi-
nations have decreased 38 percent since 2009, 
while there has been a 65-percent increase in 
origination of mortgages for more than 
$150,000; 
(4) the FHA’s mission is to serve credit-
worthy borrowers who are underserved and, 
according to the Urban Institute, the FHA 
serves 24 percent of the overall market, but 
only 19 percent of the small-dollar mortgage 
market; and 
(5) the causes behind these variations are 
not fully understood, but merit study that 
could assist in furthering the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development’s mission, 
including meeting the housing needs of bor-
rowers the program is designed to serve and 
reducing barriers to homeownership, while 
protecting the solvency of the Mutual Mort-
gage Insurance Fund. 
(b) REVIEW.—The Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development shall conduct a review of 
its FHA single-family mortgage insurance 
policies, practices, and products to identify 
any barriers or impediments to supporting, 
facilitating, and making available mortgage 
insurance for small dollar mortgages, as de-
fined by the Secretary. Not later than the 
expiration of the 12-month period beginning 
on the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary shall submit a report to the Con-
gress describing the findings of such review 
and the actions that the Secretary will take, 
without adversely affecting the solvency of 
the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, to re-
move such barriers and impediments to pro-
viding mortgage insurance for such mort-
gages.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) 
and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
ROGERS) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Washington. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I have no speakers at this 
time on this amendment and I am pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I intend to support the en bloc 
package even though it is not in our ju-
risdiction. 
At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. ISSA), 
my friend and colleague. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding time. 
Mr. Speaker, 2 minutes is not enough 
time to describe the fog of war. Two 
minutes is not enough time to describe 
a level of heroism that occurred more 
than half a century ago over the waters 
of North Korea. 
But today, one of the amendments en 
bloc will, in fact, recognize for the Con-
gressional Medal of Honor the unsung 
hero of that war. Royce Williams, who 
took on six MiGs of superior capability 
all by himself, and defended the entire 
fleet on behalf of himself, came home 
to his aircraft carrier with over 200 
holes in his aircraft, landed it at al-
most twice the speed that aircraft 
would be able to land, and his record 
was impounded in secrecy and classi-
fied for decades. 
Only now, after the Soviet Union fell, 
can we begin to understand his heroism 
and his success. 
Today, on behalf of all the members 
of the San Diego delegation of both 
parties who support this amendment, 
on behalf of the more than 100 flag offi-
cers who have signed on recommending 
that he receive the Medal of Honor, I 
am proud to say that it has been ruled 
in order, and I thank all those involved 
in bringing it to the floor. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I intend to support this package, 
and I urge its adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time not to speak on the en bloc, 
but this is the last opportunity to 
speak about the bill. 
We are going to have three other 
amendments after this en bloc, so I 
just want to do a quick closing and 
urge all Members to vote in favor of 
the bill. 
You have seen the process play out. I 
think this has been an incredibly inclu-
sive process, starting in the committee 
in a bipartisan way and moving to the 
floor, where we have had the oppor-
tunity for all Members to contribute 
and participate in this process. 
I think we have a good product that 
is going to enable us to continue to ex-
ercise our oversight of the Pentagon, 
fulfill our duties as Members of Con-
gress, and support the men and women 
of our Armed Forces in carrying out 
the missions that we ask them to do. I 
urge Members to support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS) 
for his closing remarks. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the chairman for his leader-
ship in this endeavor. This is a very 
important piece of legislation, a very 
bipartisan product, and I hope that our 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
will join the chairman and I in giving 
final passage to this important piece of 
legislation. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, in closing, I urge all Members 
to support the defense bill. I appreciate 
the staff and everybody who worked on 
the effort. I recognize the Rules Com-
mittee staff, the Armed Services Com-
mittee staff, the floor staff, and the 
Parliamentarians who are the ones who 
have to process those 1,200 amend-
ments, figure out how to write them 
out, how to make sure we are doing it 
right. 
I don’t understand fully how you are 
able to do that, so I very much appre-
ciate that you do, and we get a good 
product at the end of it. I think we 
have all participated in a good process. 
I urge Members to support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
express my opposition to Amendment No. 554 
to H.R. 7900 Offered by Mr. LANGEVIN of 
Rhode Island. 
I think we can all agree that increasing cy-
bersecurity coordination across different sec-
tors is an important goal. However, I have 
concerns with the functions of the Interagency 
Council for Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity 
Coordination. I am concerned that this amend-
ment is assigning the Council tasks that it 
does not have the qualifications to complete. 
The Council is charged with reviewing exist-
ing regulatory authorities that could be used to 
strengthen cybersecurity for critical infrastruc-
ture. It is also supposed to identify regulatory 
gaps that could invite cybersecurity risks to 
critical infrastructure and develop legislative 
proposals to resolve such regulatory gaps. 
I am worried the Council does not have the 
expertise to review regulations and propose 
legislation for our critical infrastructure. While I 
appreciate that the Council will include rep-
resentatives from Sector Risk Management 
Agencies and potentially other federal depart-
ments and agencies as determined by the 
Secretary of National Cyber Security, I am 
concerned that each councilmember’s exper-
tise within a given sector or within cybersecu-
rity generally is not adequate to perform this 
regulatory assessment or potential legislative 
proposals required by this bill. 
For example, I do not agree that a 
councilmember whose expertise is in the fi-
nancial sector should be reviewing regulations 
of 
the 
dams 
sector. 
Nor 
should 
the 
councilmember for the dams sector be pro-
posing legislation for the health and public 
health sector. 
While I understand that there are com-
monalities to cybersecurity risks posed to dif-
ferent sectors, the regulatory and statutory re-
gimes—including those related to cybersecu-
rity—must account for the unique operations 
of each sector, the type of actors in each sec-
tor, and technical feasibility within each sector. 
Therefore, I oppose the creation of the Inter-
agency Council for Critical Infrastructure Cy-
bersecurity Coordination as structured by this 
amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose 
this amendment. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the 
Smith-Norcross amendment to the Fiscal Year 
2023 NDAA directs the Army Corps of Engi-
neers to ensure high-quality workmanship on 
federal construction projects by providing each 
of their districts with clarifying, uniform guid-
ance and to enforce compliance more strongly 
with already existing laws—especially the 
Davis-Bacon Act—that mandate proper worker 
classification and the corresponding wages. 
Additionally, it requires the Corps to inves-
tigate worker classification complaints and 
third-party related complaints within 30 days of 
filings and reaffirms transparency and disclo-
sure requirements for certified payroll reports. 
For years, we have witnessed disingenuous 
contractors purposely hire underqualified work-
ers for military construction projects and put 
them in high-skilled jobs for which they lack 
the needed expertise—a practice known as 
‘‘worker misclassification’’. These contractors 
dishonestly undercut their more skilled, better- 
value competitors, only to have those impor-
tant projects mismanaged, understaffed, de-
layed, unfinished, and in some cases, rebid— 
then properly redone by high-skilled trades-
men and women who should have gotten the 
job in the first place. 
There 
are 
two 
different 
types 
of 
misclassification: craft misclassification and 
independent contractor misclassification. Craft 
misclassification occurs when dishonest con-
tractors misclassify high-skilled workers as 
general laborers or lower wage classifications 
in order to avoid paying the higher prevailing 
wage rate applicable to the high-skilled work 
actually performed. Independent contractor 
misclassification 
occurs 
when 
contractors 
misclassify employees as independent con-
tractors to avoid paying prevailing wages 
thereby reducing labor costs and avoiding 
state and federal taxes. 
These practices deny workers of their rights 
to critical benefits and protections, including

prevailing wages, worker’s compensation, and 
unemployment insurance; and communities 
suffer because misclassification results in 
lower tax revenues for federal, state, and local 
governments. 
Additionally, the end product is often com-
promised by shoddy workmanship which can 
lead to do-overs and substantial cost over-
runs. 
Congress has passed laws to prevent such 
problems and punish the offenders. The 
Davis-Bacon Act is critical in this effort as it 
requires contractors working on certain feder-
ally funded construction projects to pay their 
workers a prevailing wage to ensure that our 
federal projects are completed by skilled work-
ers who have been properly trained, classified, 
and paid according to their expertise and lo-
cality. The Act stands as a check and balance 
designed to protect employees from low-wage, 
low-bidding contractors who look to do the job 
cheaply while hurting the workers and the cli-
ent, i.e. the federal taxpayer. 
When it comes to domestic construction 
projects, the Army Corps of Engineers pro-
cures more than most divisions of the Depart-
ment of Defense. As recently as 2019, the 
Corps obligated over $11 billion for domestic 
construction contracts, according to the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO)—the fed-
eral government’s ‘‘watchdog’’ agency. 
Each federal agency is primarily responsible 
for enforcing the Davis-Bacon protections at 
its construction worksites. The Army Corps 
has a lot of construction projects and federal 
construction monies to properly oversee. Un-
fortunately, federal construction projects in my 
district, including Army Corps projects at Joint 
Base 
McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst—have 
fallen 
short in oversight and compliance and have 
run into trouble with unqualified, subpar bid-
ders who avoid hiring needed skilled workers. 
We have seen cases of sophisticated work— 
HVAC, plumbing and sheet metal—needing to 
be ripped up and redone after the irrespon-
sible bidders failed to properly do the work. 
To combat this persistent problem and en-
sure these important laws are being enforced, 
in 2019, Congress passed an amendment I 
authored, cosponsored by Congressman Nor-
cross, to the 2020 NDAA directing the GAO to 
study the contracting practices of the Corps 
with a focus on the monitoring and enforce-
ment of the Davis-Bacon Act. 
The GAO conducted its audit from May 
2020 to March 2021 examining Corps guid-
ance, relevant documents about the Davis- 
Bacon Act, Department of Labor guidance and 
other relevant laws and regulations. They con-
ducted semi-structured interviews in four Army 
Corps district offices—Louisville, New Orleans, 
New York and Walla Walla—based on the dis-
trict’s activities and representing ‘‘various geo-
graphical areas in the U.S. and a mixture of 
volume and type of construction contracts 
(e.g. military and civil projects)’’. They inter-
viewed Corps headquarters officials, DOL offi-
cials and four external groups including two 
labor unions and two trade associations. 
The GAO said that ‘‘monitoring, including 
payroll reviews and on-site inspections, are 
key to ensuring that the Corps enforces con-
tractor’s compliance with the Davis-Bacon 
Act’’. 
But the report also described implementa-
tion inconsistencies across the various districts 
that can easily lead to gaps in compliance with 
Davis-Bacon. 
The GAO concluded that aspects of the re-
views and on-site inspections ‘‘may not be suf-
ficient.’’ They found that ‘‘Corps documents 
lack information’’ and said that ‘‘In the ab-
sence of directions to consistently document 
on-the-ground conditions, like the number of 
employees on site’’ district officials ‘‘may not 
be fully using on-site inspection to ensure con-
tractors’ compliance with the [Davis-Bacon] 
Act.’’ 
Ultimately, the GAO recommended that the 
Army Corps provide clarifying information on 
how they conduct payroll reviews and docu-
ment on-site inspections to ensure the proper 
monitoring of the number of workers and work 
performed. 
More work remains to be done to implement 
these recommendations and crack down on 
this harmful practice. 
Today’s amendment addresses those prob-
lems and instructs the Corps’ to fully comply 
with relevant federal laws and regulations for: 
building quality facilities—labs, hangars, hous-
ing, and workspaces—for our military men and 
women; providing an honest wage for con-
struction workers; and providing the best in-
vestment for the taxpayer. 
Mr. Speaker, working with partners such as 
the AFL–CIO, North America’s Building Trades 
Unions, New Jersey trades like the IBEW and 
the Plumbers and Pipefitters, and my friend, 
Congressman NORCROSS, we can finally en-
sure that military construction is done with the 
best possible workmanship, that we make best 
use of the hardworking Americans’ taxpayer 
dollars, and that the men and women who 
work with our military are treated fairly. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of En Bloc 5 to H.R. 7900, the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, 
which includes my two final amendments to 
this legislation. These additional provisions will 
strengthen how we enforce U.S. sanctions and 
provide the Congress with vital information 
about the China-Afghan economic relationship. 
Amendment No. 561 establishes the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Exchange 
within OFAC. This voluntary public-private 
partnership would advance information sharing 
between law enforcement agencies, national 
security agencies, financial institutions, and 
OFAC. It would facilitate sanctions administra-
tion and enforcement that target foreign coun-
tries and regimes, terrorists, international nar-
cotics traffickers, and other threats to national 
security, foreign policy, or the U.S. economy. 
This collaboration will allow for U.S. economic 
and trade sanctions to be better administered 
and enforced, and, ultimately, make them 
more effective. 
Amendment No. 562 would require the Sec-
retary of the Treasury to brief the Congress on 
the identification and analysis of Chinese eco-
nomic, commercial, and financial connections 
to Afghanistan which fuel both Chinese and 
Taliban interests, to include illicit financial net-
works involved in narcotics trafficking, illicit fi-
nancial transactions, official corruption, natural 
resources exploitation, and terrorist networks. 
Earlier this year, China, among other nations, 
pledged to deepen its economic and trade ties 
with Afghanistan through the so-called ‘‘Tunxi 
Initiative.’’ However, China has a history of 
seeking to increase its influence through de-
velopment and economic assistance that com-
pletely ignores, or even undermines, rule of 
law, independent civil society, and protection 
of human rights. After all that the United 
States has invested and sacrificed in Afghani-
stan, it is vital that Congress understand the 
extent of China’s connections, and intentions, 
in Afghanistan so we can respond accordingly. 
Once again I would like to express my sin-
cerest thanks to Armed Services Committee 
Chairman ADAM SMITH, Ranking Member MIKE 
ROGERS, and their staffs for including my 
amendments in this last En Bloc. I would urge 
all my colleagues to vote in favor of this final 
En Bloc. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, my amendment 
No. 606, which is included in En Bloc 5, cre-
ates a VA advisory committee for veterans liv-
ing in the U.S. insular areas and in the Freely 
Associated States. Veterans in my district, es-
pecially, and in the other insular areas, too, 
face barriers to VA services no vet should be 
forced to endure. 
My amendment creates a Department of 
Veterans Affairs advisory committee rep-
resenting veterans living in the U.S. insular 
areas of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, 
American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands as well as the Freely Associated 
States of Palau, Marshall Islands, and the 
Federated States of Micronesia. 
In my district, the Northern Mariana Islands, 
there are no VA clinics and no Vet Centers. 
Veterans there sometimes fly 3,700 miles to 
Hawai’i or over 6,000 miles to California to ac-
cess VA services. Even reaching VA services 
in nearby Guam is a challenge. 
That is why my amendment, establishing a 
committee to educate the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs on the obstacles insular area vet-
erans face, is so important. Each U.S. insular 
area and each of the three Freely Associated 
States would have a seat on the advisory 
committee. They would be able to describe 
the barriers their veterans face in receiving VA 
services. 
Establishing an advisory committee will not 
solve every logistical problem for veterans 
who live in geographically remote areas of 
America. But, at least, those veterans on the 
margins will have a way to communicate di-
rectly with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on 
how to improve VA programs and services in 
their communities. 
This amendment is, with minor technical 
changes, the same legislation as H.R. 3730, 
which passed in the House last fall with strong 
bipartisan support. The American Legion, Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan 
Veterans of America, Disabled American Vet-
erans, and Minority Veterans of America have 
endorsed the legislation. 
I ask my colleagues to support En Bloc 5. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution Number 1224, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman 
from 
Washington 
(Mr. 
SMITH). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The en bloc amendments were agreed 
to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

July 14, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of title LI of division E, insert 
the following new section: 
SEC. 51ll. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AF-
FAIRS AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ON 
FERTILITY SERVICES. 
(a) AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.—The Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs shall conduct an aware-
ness campaign regarding the types of fer-
tility treatments, procedures, and services 
covered under the medical benefits package 
of the Department of Veterans Affairs that 
are available to veterans experiencing issues 
with fertility. 
(b) MODES OF OUTREACH.—In carrying out 
subsection (a), the Secretary shall ensure 
that a variety of modes of outreach are in-
corporated into the awareness campaign 
under such subsection, taking into consider-
ation the age range of the veteran popu-
lation. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a report that in-
cludes a summary of the actions that have 
been taken to implement the awareness cam-
paign under subsection (a) and how the Sec-
retary plans to better engage women vet-
erans, to ensure awareness of such veterans 
regarding covered fertility services avail-
able. 
(d) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES
DEFINED.—In this section, the term 
‘‘appropriate 
congressional 
committees’’ 
means— 
(1) the Committees on Armed Services of 
the House of Representatives and the Senate; 
and 
(2) the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs of 
the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. MENG) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
My amendment requires the VA to 
conduct an outreach campaign to vet-
erans to make them aware of the full 
range of fertility treatments, proce-
dures, and services covered under the 
VA’s medical benefits package. 
I emphasize that this amendment 
was included in the fiscal year 2022 
House-passed NDAA as part of an en 
bloc 
package 
and 
received 
over-
whelming support from both sides of 
the aisle. 
Our veterans, who served our country 
honorably, deserve every opportunity 
to begin the family of their dreams. A 
study released last year on reproduc-
tive-aged veteran women found that 
the rate of infertility among veterans 
is more than 50 percent higher than 
among the general female population. 
For years, the VA has provided a 
range of fertility treatments and serv-
ices to veterans. Many veterans have 
brought to my attention the issue that 
because they are unaware of the fer-
tility services covered by the VA, they 
instead seek out expensive private care 
to help them begin a family. 
This amendment is simple. We pro-
vide critical funding to the VA to offer 
comprehensive medical care to our vet-
erans. The VA should be doing out-
reach to all veterans to ensure that 
they are fully aware of the critical 
healthcare services covered by the VA. 
Those who have served our country 
honorably and now struggle with infer-
tility as a result of their service de-
serve assistance in trying to build a 
family. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I claim time 
in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, this amend-
ment would direct the VA to conduct 
an awareness campaign regarding types 
of fertility treatments, procedures, and 
services that are available to veterans. 
While I do agree that all veterans 
should be made aware of the care and 
services covered under the earned VA 
medical benefits package, I must op-
pose this inclusion of the amendment 
in the NDAA. 
I cannot support an outreach cam-
paign that champions a process like in 
vitro fertilization, a process that cre-
ates life in a petri dish and then either 
destroys, discards, or forever freezes it 
on a shelf. This is not life-affirming. 
This is not right for veterans or their 
spouses or their children. 
Being a father is one of the high-
lights of my life. I wish every veteran 
could know the joy of parenthood, and 
I want to help veterans struggling with 
infertility to connect with life-affirm-
ing resources and support. 
I hope to work with my colleagues 
and fellow veterans to find a better 
way forward for veterans who are un-
able to conceive. Dropping an amend-
ment into the NDAA is not the way 
forward, and for that reason, I am op-
posed to the amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I mentioned earlier in 
my statement, I cannot support this 
amendment that promotes the provi-
sion of in vitro fertilization as part of 
the VA medical benefits package, and I 
urge Members to oppose the amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. MENG). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

AMENDMENT NO. 637 OFFERED BY MR. TAKANO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 637 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of title LI, insert the following: 
SEC. 51ll. PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE BENE-
FITS 
FOR 
CERTAIN 
INDIVIDUALS 
WHO 
SERVED 
IN 
THE 
ARMED 
FORCES 
OF 
THE 
REPUBLIC 
OF 
KOREA. 
Section 109 of title 38, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new subsection: 
‘‘(d)(1) Any person described in paragraph 
(2) shall be entitled to hospital and domi-
ciliary care and medical services within the 
United States under chapter 17 of this title 
to the same extent as if the service described 
in such paragraph had been performed in the 
Armed Forces of the United States. 
‘‘(2) A person described in this paragraph is 
a person whom the Secretary determines 
meets the following criteria: 
‘‘(A) The person served in Vietnam as a 
member of the armed forces of the Republic 
of Korea at any time during the period be-
ginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on 
May 7, 1975, or such other period as deter-
mined appropriate by the Secretary for pur-
poses of this subsection. 
‘‘(B) The person became a citizen of the 
United States on or after the date on which 
such service in the armed forces of the Re-
public of Korea ended.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. TAKANO) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my amendment, which would correct 
a decades-long gap in VA’s Allied Bene-
ficiary Program by extending this pro-
gram to South Korean veterans now 
living in the United States who served 
alongside the United States during the 
Vietnam war. 
For 63 years, veterans of allied forces 
from World Wars I and II have been 
able to enroll in VA healthcare. The 
U.K., Australia, France, New Zealand, 
and Canada have had reciprocal agree-
ments with the United States, reim-
bursing the VA for care provided to 
their veterans and vice versa. 
In the 1970s, Congress also made vet-
erans of the Czech and Polish Armed 
Forces who have been American citi-
zens for at least 10 years eligible for 
VA healthcare. However, neither the 
Czech Republic nor Poland have recip-
rocal agreements with the United 
States, so VA is not reimbursed for the 
care provided to these veterans. 
Yet still today, veterans of the Re-
public of Korea who fought alongside 
us in the Vietnam war and then went 
on to become citizens of the United 
States are denied what their European 
counterparts already have: access to 
veteran-centric, high-quality care from 
VA. 
Over 300,000 Koreans fought alongside 
the United States in Vietnam. Thou-
sands went on to build lives here and

become citizens, but today only 300 of 
these veterans are still living. 
However, despite their service as our 
allies in the Korean military, these Ko-
rean Americans are not recognized as 
U.S. veterans in theory or in title and 
are therefore not granted access to VA 
services under the law. They are also 
not covered by the Korean healthcare 
system while living here in the United 
States. 
Once they are naturalized United 
States citizens, they are recognized by 
South Korea as foreign nationals, with 
no benefits available to them in the 
United States. This is the decades-long 
inequity that this amendment would 
seek to address. This amendment is 
about supporting naturalized United 
States citizens as much as it is about 
sending a clear message to our allies 
abroad: If you serve alongside us in 
times of war, we will have your back. 
This is important not only to provide 
vital healthcare to veterans here in the 
United States but also to instill con-
fidence in our country as an inter-
national partner and ally. Three hun-
dred Korean Vietnam veterans, now 
Americans, are asking this country to 
respect their service as fully as we re-
spect the service of our European al-
lies. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I claim time 
in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment would 
provide access to VA medical care and 
services for veterans who served in the 
Armed Forces of the Republic of Korea 
during the Vietnam conflict. 
There are approximately 3,000 Korean 
veterans living in the U.S. as citizens 
and who served alongside American 
forces during the Vietnam conflict. 
This amendment would grant them eli-
gibility to enroll in the VA healthcare 
system. This would create an inequity 
between these individuals and veterans 
of U.S. Armed Forces who are not cur-
rently eligible to enroll in the VA care. 
It would also create a disparity with 
the veterans of other allies of other 
conflicts who later became U.S. citi-
zens. Ultimately, the amendment un-
fairly singles out one group of service 
above others. That is why I cannot sup-
port the amendment’s inclusion in the 
NDAA. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend, 
the ranking member of the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee, implying that he 
would be supportive of this if we in-
cluded other categories and other co-
horts of veterans in a similar place. I 
go along with that. 
I would be willing to work with the 
ranking member to address these other 
cohorts because I believe that we need 
to extend this particular offer to these 
others, but there is no reason for us not 
to act on this particular amendment 
because we have these 300 now-natural-
ized Korean-American citizens who 
served with us in the Vietnam war who 
have critical health needs. 
Let us take care of these veterans 
now, but I pledge to work with the 
ranking member to address the other 
categories of naturalized American 
citizens who have served in a similar 
vein as our Czech Americans, our Pol-
ish Americans, and all of our other 
American allies. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the chairman’s willingness to work on 
doing that as well, but this amendment 
itself being included in the NDAA will 
not take care of those others. I would 
like to work with him to make sure 
that everybody that needs to be in-
cluded is included. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
just urge that all Members of Congress 
support this amendment. The ranking 
member and I can work on the other 
classifications, other classes of vet-
erans. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, as I men-
tioned earlier in my statement, I can-
not support the amendment that would 
provide benefits to one group of allied 
veterans before considering that same 
eligibility for all veterans. I appreciate 
the opportunity for the chairman to 
work with us to make sure that all the 
U.S. Armed Forces that have supported 
us over the years, that we can come to 
some sort of agreement. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-
pose this amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

printed in part A of House Report 117–

Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of title LVIII, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 58l. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN ASSIST-
ANCE TO THE PHILIPPINES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—No funds authorized to be 
appropriated or otherwise made available to 
the Department of State are authorized to be 
made available to provide assistance for the 
Philippine National Police, including assist-
ance in the form of equipment or training, 
until the Secretary of State certifies to the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate that the 
Government of the Philippines has— 
(1) investigated and successfully pros-
ecuted members of the Philippine National 
Police who have violated human rights, en-
sured that police personnel cooperated with 
judicial authorities in such cases, and af-
firmed that such violations have ceased; 
(2) established that the Philippine National 
Police effectively protects the rights of trade 
unionists, journalists, human rights defend-
ers, critics of the government, faith and reli-
gious leaders, and other civil society activ-
ists to operate without interference; 
(3) taken effective steps to guarantee a ju-
dicial system that is capable of inves-
tigating, prosecuting, and bringing to justice 
members of the police and military who have 
committed human rights abuses; and 
(4) fully complied with domestic and 
United States audits and investigations re-
garding the improper use of prior security 
assistance. 
(b) WAIVER.—The President may, on a case- 
by-case basis and for periods not to exceed 
180 days each, waive the prohibition under 
subsection (a) if the President certifies to 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Foreign Relations of the Senate not later 
than 15 days before such waiver is to take ef-
fect that such waiver is vital to the national 
security interests of the United States or its 
partners and allies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
WILD) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, at its core what this 
amendment says is simple: After an es-
timated 30,000 extrajudicial killings in 
the Philippines between 2016 and today, 
after the assassinations, arbitrary ar-
rests, torture, and red tagging of labor 
organizers and opposition leaders, after 
former President Duterte’s calls for as-
sassinating 
politically 
engaged 
bishops, after the Philippines has been 
named year after year by the Inter-
national Trade Union Confederation as 
one of the world’s 10 most repressive 
countries for the labor movement and 
workers, the time is long overdue to 
begin putting some basic human rights 
guardrails in place in the United 
States-Philippines relationship. 
I believe our policy should be built on 
a clear principle: Our constituents’ tax 
dollars should not be used to supply 
weapons, training, or any other assist-
ance to state security forces that vio-
lently target political opponents, in-
cluding a United States citizen, Bran-
don Lee, a human rights activist, who 
was shot by state security forces in 
2019 and remains paralyzed from the 
chest down today as a result of that at-
tack. Brandon deserves to know that 
his government stands with him, not 
with his attackers. 
I have made this point to the Trump 
administration, and I am making it to

the Biden administration. If we in the 
United States are going to say that we 
stand for human rights around the 
world, then we need to stand for human 
rights around the world, not just when 
it is politically convenient and not just 
when it is easy. 
Is it too much to ask that our coun-
try put some modest conditions on 
arming 
and 
assisting the security 
forces of an authoritarian government 
waging war on its own people? 
Is it too much to ask that our gov-
ernment side with workers and the 
labor movement here at home and 
around the world? With faith and reli-
gious leaders? With human rights ac-
tivists and dissidents who are simply 
trying to build a free society? 
Those who oppose this amendment 
will claim that providing uncritical, 
unconditional assistance to the Phil-
ippines, regardless of the war its gov-
ernment is waging against its own pop-
ulation, is critical for our national se-
curity objective of countering China. 
But the need to counter the Chinese re-
gime’s authoritarianism on the inter-
national stage is precisely why it is so 
important that we maintain our credi-
bility on human rights. It is why it is 
so vital that we do not undermine our 
own case for democracy and open our-
selves up to charges of hypocrisy by 
supporting brutal regimes out of short- 
term political expediency. 
Let’s pass this amendment and send 
a resounding signal to the world that 
we are prepared to make respect for 
human rights a cornerstone of U.S. for-
eign policy rather than an empty slo-
gan that we yield arbitrarily. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
time in opposition to the amendment.

Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I would 
note if there has to be a Democrat in 
that seat, there is no Democrat I would 
rather see than the gentleman from 
New York. He is a fine gentleman who 
I have worked with over the years and 
respect greatly. 
As the ranking member of the Asia 
and Pacific Subcommittee and a co- 
chair of the U.S.-Philippines Friend-
ship Caucus, I would submit that our 
alliance with the Philippines is one of 
our 
most 
important 
relationships 
across the globe. We have partnered 
with them for over 70 years now, and 
cooperation between our two nations is 
just as important today as it has ever 
been. 
In the face of territorial aggression 
in the South China Sea by the People’s 
Liberation Army, which of course is 
the military wing of the Chinese Com-
munist Party, the CCP, our partner-
ship with the Philippines serves as a 
geostrategic counterweight to China. 
As Chairman Xi seeks to control inter-
national maritime trade routes, includ-
ing key waterways like the Luzon 
Strait, the Philippines remains a crit-
ical partner in checking his nefarious 
ambitions. 
As with all our strongest alliances, 
our relationship with the Philippines 
extends beyond military affairs, for ex-
ample, to cooperation in law enforce-
ment. Our joint efforts with the Phil-
ippines in this regard are really crit-
ical to strengthening maritime secu-
rity as well as tackling the evils of 
human trafficking and narcotics traf-
ficking. 
Of course, we have all been appalled 
by former President Duterte’s brutal 
drug war, particularly its extrajudicial 
killings. Such brutality was the pri-
mary reason why Congress suspended 
International Narcotics Control and 
Law Enforcement assistance to the 
Philippine National Police. 
However, it would be self-defeating to 
simply cut off all cooperation with 
Philippine law enforcement, as this 
amendment seeks to do. The amend-
ment would end maritime law enforce-
ment activities that strengthen U.S. 
national security. It would block joint 
efforts to pursue drug traffickers and 
child traffickers, and it would stop 
human rights and rule of law assist-
ance. 
Fortunately, the June 30 inaugura-
tion of President Marcos is an oppor-
tunity to strengthen the U.S.-Phil-
ippines relationship to address not only 
threats to maritime security in the 
Indo-Pacific but also human rights and 
respect for rule of law. 
This amendment would undermine 
the Biden administration and those of 
us in Congress who are working to-
wards these efforts. It would curtail co-
operative efforts between our security 
forces at a time when Chairman Xi 
seeks to dismantle our more than 70- 
year mutual security partnership with 
the Philippines. It doesn’t make sense. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues for 
all the reasons that I just mentioned to 
oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, my col-
league across the aisle is arguing for 
the status quo. As I said before, it is 
critical for our own national security 
objectives of countering China that we 
maintain our credibility on human 
rights issues. It is absolutely vital that 
we do not undermine our own case for 
democracy. 
b 1200 
If I have one message for all those 
who defend the status quo on this 
issue, all those who claim that we ef-
fectively need to choose between our 
security and our principles, it is this: 
It doesn’t need to be this way. Abdi-
cating our values makes us less secure 
in the long run. That is why I urge my 
colleagues to pass this amendment by a 
resounding margin and to cosponsor 
my bill, the Philippines Human Rights 
Act. 
The vote on this amendment is just a 
first step of what must be a sustained 
commitment to standing with the peo-
ple of the Philippines. Together, we can 
finally begin shaping a U.S. policy to-
ward the Philippines that is anchored 
in respect for human rights and human 
dignity, those of the people of the Phil-
ippines as well as those of our people 
and all people around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, just to conclude and ac-
tually reiterate some of my previous 
remarks, I have been the co-chair of 
the Philippines Friendship Caucus, the 
Republican co-chair, along with my 
colleague BOBBY SCOTT from Virginia, 
for quite a few years now. We were 
both appalled by President Duterte’s 
looking the other way and actually 
probably being involved to some degree 
directly in the command of a lot of the 
extrajudicial killings as well as the 
loss of life and brutality that took 
place for quite a few years. 
We agreed with him on the war on 
drugs. Drugs kill far too many Fili-
pinos and kill far too many Americans. 
But we do not agree on extrajudicial 
measures which take human life. 
However, this is an opportunity now, 
because that government is in the past, 
and we have a new government. This is 
a new opportunity to build up this rela-
tionship once again between these two 
key allies, the United States and the 
Philippines. It is an important rela-
tionship, particularly when one con-
siders that our principal challenge 
across the globe right now is coun-
tering the nefarious actions of the 
CCP, the Chinese Communist Party. 
So I would urge my colleagues to op-
pose this amendment. Although well 
intentioned, I think ultimately it 
would do more harm than good. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 1224, the previous question is or-
dered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
WILD). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The amendment was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
VITIATING PROCEEDINGS ON AMENDMENT 
OFFERED BY MR. SCHIFF 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order-
ing of the yeas and nays on amendment 
No. 451 printed in part A of House Re-
port 117–405 be vitiated to the end that 
the amendment be withdrawn. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the ordering of the yeas and 
nays is vitiated and the amendment is 
withdrawn.

(BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT, MS. PELOSI WAS 
ALLOWED TO SPEAK OUT OF ORDER.) 
TRIBUTE TO JAIME LIZARRAGA 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a departing member of 
my office, my longtime senior adviser, 
Jaime Lizarraga. 
This is a moment of great official 
pride as, last week, he was unani-
mously confirmed by the Senate to 
serve as a Commissioner of the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission. 
His departure is also bittersweet for 
me, as he has been an invaluable mem-
ber of our team for the last 15 years. 
All of those who have ever had the 
privilege of working with Jaime know 
firsthand, he is the model of an out-
standing, patriotic public servant in a 
bipartisan way. 
He has dedicated his entire career to 
doing the people’s work. He has ex-
celled not only in my office but also on 
the House Financial Services Com-
mittee, where he worked with then- 
Chairman Barney Frank; at the Treas-
ury Department; and as a staffer at the 
SEC. 
Indeed, President Biden’s selection of 
Jaime to serve on the SEC is a testa-
ment to Jaime’s deep expertise, stra-
tegic mind, and strong values. 
His unanimous confirmation in the 
Senate was a tremendous victory for 
working families and for the entire 
country. 
Here in the House, his masterful 
leadership was instrumental in ena-
bling and enacting some of the most 
consequential economic legislation in a 
generation. During the financial melt-
down of 2008, he helped stabilize the 
markets with the Troubled Assets Re-
lief Program, TARP. 
In the wake of economic catastrophe, 
he also helped strengthen the oversight 
of Wall Street with the historic Dodd- 
Frank legislation. 
As COVID ravaged the Nation, he 
helped negotiate multiple relief pack-
ages that saved lives and spared liveli-
hoods. 
For years, he has been a relentless 
champion in the Congress for restruc-
turing Puerto Rico’s debt, supporting 
affordable housing, reforming our im-
migration system, and building eco-
nomic opportunity for all. 
Beyond his many impressive legisla-
tive achievements, Jaime is truly the 
embodiment of the American Dream. 
The proud son of immigrants from 
Mexico, he has never forgotten his par-
ents’ sacrifices to give him and his sis-
ter a brighter future. In that spirit, 
every day, he fights relentlessly to 
open doors of opportunity for every 
American family. 
Jaime’s brilliance, expertise, and per-
sonal kindness will be sorely missed in 
my office and in Congress. But our Na-
tion will greatly benefit from his con-
tinued public service at the SEC as he 
strives to build a fairer financial future 
for all. 
On behalf of the House, we congratu-
late Jaime on this remarkable achieve-
ment and wish him so much success in 
his new role. We send best wishes to 
him, his beloved wife, and his 5 dear 
children as they begin this exciting 
chapter. 
Congratulations, Jaime, and thank 
you for your service.

ELIMINATING 
DISCRIMINATION 
AGAINST PARENTS AND GUARD-
IANS WITH DISABILITIES 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, 
earlier this week, I led my Democratic 
and Republican colleagues in intro-
ducing legislation to eliminate dis-
crimination against parents and guard-
ians with disabilities. 
Together with Representatives BASS, 
BACON, FITZPATRICK, and LAWRENCE, I 
introduced the Equality for Families 
with Disabilities Act, just 2 weeks be-
fore the 32nd anniversary of the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act. 
Today, there are 4.1 million parents 
with disabilities raising families here 
in the United States. Yet, parents and 
guardians with disabilities face exces-
sive scrutiny and disproportionate tar-
geting for unwarranted intervention 
from child welfare agencies. 
The research is clear: Children raised 
by parents with disabilities do not ex-
hibit stunted development or worse 
outcomes than their peers. In fact, the 
opposite is true. Children raised by par-
ents 
with 
disabilities 
demonstrate 
greater compassion, tolerance, prob-
lem-solving skills, and other positive 
characteristics. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to end dis-
crimination against parents and guard-
ians in State child welfare proceedings 
once and for all. 
Thirty-two 
years 
since 
Congress 
passed the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, I encourage all of my colleagues 
to support this urgent legislation. 
f 
HONORING JOANN MERRIGAN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in recognition of a pres-
tigious 
journalist 
and 
outstanding 
woman, Ms. JoAnn Merrigan of WSAV 
News in Savannah. 
With over 20 years in reporting, 
JoAnn has made quite a name for her-
self in multiple States for her high- 
quality news coverage. 
She started her career in Iowa, fol-
lowing around Presidential hopefuls as 
they began their journey through the 
primaries. She also followed local and 
State-based 
elections, 
providing 
Iowans with the information they 
needed to make an informed vote. 
After her term in Iowa came to an 
end, she relocated to northern Cali-
fornia where she continued to deepen 
her commitment to journalism. 
After surviving the Loma Prieta 
Earthquake, JoAnn traveled around 
speaking to survivors and their fami-
lies to get a better understanding of 
this tragedy. 
From there, JoAnn moved her career 
to Nebraska, and eventually landing in 
the greatest city in the world: Savan-
nah, Georgia. 
Creating quite a respected name for 
herself, JoAnn has earned an out-
standing number of awards, including 
the Edward R. Murrow Award for In-
vestigative Reporting, a Gabby Award, 
as well as an award from the Georgia 
Associated Press Broadcasters Associa-
tion in 2013. 
Her exceptional career in journalism 
has commanded the respect of many, 
including myself, and I am proud to 
honor her today on the floor. 
f 
HONORING JOHN R. HATCHER, III 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, it was 
once said: ‘‘The greatness of a man is 
not in how much wealth he acquires, 
but in his integrity and his ability to 
affect those around him positively.’’ 
By this definition, John R. Hatcher, 
III, was a great man. 
As the founding father of the Ven-
tura County chapter of the NAACP, 
John was guided by his passion for so-
cial justice, and he was a champion for 
diversity, equality, and civil rights. 
An Air Force veteran, a civil servant, 
an extraordinary citizen, our commu-
nity is forever grateful for his immeas-
urable contributions. 
For these reasons, I thank my col-
leagues for supporting the passage of 
H.R. 5659, which will designate the post 
office in Oxnard, California, as the 
John R. Hatcher, III, Post Office. 
This bill is but a small measure of 
appreciation that recognizes John and 
his life’s work, and I urge the bill’s 
swift consideration before the Senate. 
f 
HONORING KRIS HANSEN 
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Kris Hansen, 
a great Montanan and a dear friend 
who passed away just last week. 
Kris was a mighty warrior who loved 
her country and embodied the highest 
ideals of public service in the State of 
Montana. 
She served overseas with both the 
National Guard and the CIA, followed 
by an exceptional tenure with the Mon-
tana State legislature, alongside me in 
the Montana State Auditor’s office, 
and most recently as Lieutenant Attor-
ney General. 
She was a blessing and a light upon 
all the lives that she touched. 
Kris was also a strong advocate for 
students and families. She used her 
gifts to fight for access to quality edu-
cation for children across the State of 
Montana. 
Her commitment to protecting and 
preserving our way of life will always 
be a defining pillar of her legacy. 
I am so thankful to have worked with 
Kris and developed a special friendship 
with her. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with 
Fred and Nancy and the Hansen family 
during this most difficult time. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT 
FIRST CLASS HEATH ROBINSON 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to Sergeant First Class 
Heath Robinson, a son of Ohio, who 
served America honorably and with 
distinction. 
After tours of duty in Kosovo and 
Iraq, he returned home and was diag-
nosed with terminal cancer. 
Sergeant First Class Robinson, like 
far too many others, became afflicted 
with the grievous wounds of war caused 
by exposure to toxic substances. 
He and thousands more made the ul-
timate sacrifice. Every American owes 
them our unending gratitude. 
But we owe them more than that. 
When returning from the battlefields 
with injuries and illnesses, America 
has a moral responsibility to provide 
every ounce of care to our servicemem-
bers and veterans. 
This week, the House takes a step 
forward in meeting this sacred obliga-
tion. The Sergeant First Class Heath 
Robinson PACT Act will ensure that 
those who served and are suffering re-
ceive the care they need to heal. 
The debt America owes to these pa-
triots can never be fully repaid, but we 
can make a down payment by deliv-
ering the care to help them overcome, 
the care that they have most certainly 
earned. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE UPCOMING 
150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ASCEN-
SION ST. VINCENT HOSPITAL 
(Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the upcoming 
150th anniversary of Ascension St. Vin-
cent Hospital, formerly St. Mary’s Hos-
pital, in Evansville, Indiana. 
Although the name has changed, its 
goal of providing quality care for citi-
zens of the tri-State area has remained 
constant. I practiced cardiothoracic 
surgery there before being elected to 
Congress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6613 
July 14, 2022 
Since the Daughters of Charity ac-
cepted their first patient on July 18, 
1872, Ascension St. Vincent, formerly 
St. Mary’s, Evansville has remained 
true to its mission. 
They say: ‘‘We have a mission, a rea-
son for being here, to keep healthcare 
human; human for our patients, human 
for our families, human for our doc-
tors, and human for all our associates. 
The poor will come, and the rich will 
come, if they know they are going to 
be treated as people.’’ 
For the last 150 years, this hospital 
has been a leader in medical innova-
tion and care. In fact, it was one of the 
first in the region with operating room 
lighting, something that I acutely ap-
preciate because I am a surgeon my-
self. It also hosted the first accredited 
cancer program and the first level 3 
neonatal intensive care unit in the tri- 
State region. 
I am grateful for Ascension St. Vin-
cent Evansville’s continued commit-
ment to caring for all Hoosiers and 
wish them a happy 150th anniversary. 
f 
DROP IN LEGAL IMMIGRATION 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize an unaddressed 
contributor to labor shortages across 
our economy, a drop in legal immigra-
tion. 
Researchers at the University of 
California at Davis found that: ‘‘By the 
end of 2021 there were about 2 million 
fewer working-age immigrants living 
in the United States than there would 
have been if the pre-2020 immigration 
trend had continued unchanged.’’ 
This has hit certain industries hard, 
including food, hospitality, construc-
tion, transportation, and healthcare, 
particularly nursing, at a time when 
our economy is overheating in its re-
covery from COVID–19. 
A significant part of lowering cost 
and avoiding a recession is expanding 
the productive capacity of the econ-
omy. Until we address staffing short-
falls, we will continue to artificially 
constrain the supply side of our econ-
omy and drive up costs for everyday 
people. We must recognize and reverse 
this trend by clearing the visa backlog, 
documenting immigrants and Dream-
ers already here, and increasing caps 
for both immigration and refugee re-
settlement. It is not just a moral im-
perative; it is an economic one. 
f 
CORPORAL JOSEPH RODNEY 
CHAPMAN IS A HERO 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak 
about an incredible American hero 
from the small town of Freeport, Penn-
sylvania. 
Corporal Joseph Rodney Chapman 
was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942, 
and he fought with the 80th Infantry 
Division in World War II. He fought 
across France, was wounded twice in 
the process, and earned a Bronze Star 
for his heroic actions to destroy a Ger-
man machine gun and its crew. 
In the spring of 1944, as the Allies 
continued to drive the enemy into re-
treat, Corporal Chapman found himself 
under enemy fire and was taken as a 
prisoner of war. 
After returning home to Pennsyl-
vania, he worked for the post office in 
Freeport for 35 years as a mail carrier 
and clerk. He was married to his late 
wife, Mary, for 69 years, and he just 
celebrated a very happy 100th birthday 
this past October. 
Mr. Speaker, Corporal Chapman is 
the epitome of the American spirit. 
Therefore, I am incredibly proud to in-
troduce legislation today that would 
rename the very post office Mr. Chap-
man worked at in his honor. He has de-
voted his life to his country and his 
community, and for that we owe him a 
great debt of gratitude.

ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ATTACK ON 
DEMOCRACY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this week, I had the privilege of taking 
some of our young high school students 
and visitors throughout the Capitol. 
What a sense of pride I had in the 
beauty of this Capitol, the beauty of 
this building, but what it symbolizes is 
democracy. 
As I walked through the Halls, I was 
reminded of the important hearings 
that are going on in the January 6th 
Committee. The most recent hearing 
made it very clear that the Oath Keep-
ers and the Proud Boys came specifi-
cally 
at 
the 
calling 
of 
President 
Trump. The terrorism that occurred 
was driven by his lack of accepting the 
peaceful transfer of government. It was 
the big lie. 
What we saw on that day, January 6, 
was domestic terrorism on steroids, 
destined to commit mayhem, blood-
shed, and death. It was an attack on 
democracy, and it is being evidenced 
every day that the hearings proceed 
methodically, block by block, evidence 
by evidence. It is clear in the injury of 
law enforcement officers and loss of 
life that we have to say to those of this 
Nation: You have to take ownership of 
protecting the values and the sanctity 
of democracy. 
Yes, someone must be held account-
able. The President must be held ac-
countable because what happened was 
not only an attack on democracy and 
the peaceful transfer of government, 
but loss of life and death, and that can-
not go unanswered. 
AN UNBORN CHILD IS A HUMAN 
LIFE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CORREA). 
Under 
the 
Speaker’s 
an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLY) is recognized for 60 minutes as 
the designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the topic of this Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 
2,500 unborn lives we lose to abortion 
each day who cannot stand for them-
selves. That is nearly half a million lit-
tle boys and little girls in the United 
States alone this year. These numbers 
don’t reflect, though, and take into 
consideration self-administered chem-
ical abortions. 
Last month, the Supreme Court an-
nounced what the pro-life movement 
was waiting half a century to hear: Roe 
v. Wade is overturned. As a proud pro- 
life grandfather of 10, I enthusiasti-
cally applaud the Justices for recog-
nizing that this terrible relic from 1973 
has no place in 2022. 
Roe was both a legal and moral 
abomination from the beginning. It 
mocked our Nation’s Constitution and 
paved the way for the abortion of more 
than 63 million innocent babies in the 
years since. 
The men who first decided Roe in-
vented the right to abortion out of thin 
air. By adding an extra line to our Con-
stitution, they ignored one of the first 
sentences of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, which holds that we are en-
dowed by our creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness. 
With Roe in the dustbin of history, 
the abortion question returns to the 
democratic arena where it belongs. The 
most contentious of issues can now be 
properly debated and deliberated at 
both the Federal and State levels, 
where, ideally, the most logical and 
persuasive arguments can triumph and 
translate into new law. 
Let us have clear eyes to see exactly 
what science shows us, that fetuses in 
the womb are human beings who de-
velop with each passing second. These 
innocent children have their own DNA 
and soon develop hands, feet, eyes, and 
lips. They can also feel pain. Just as 
importantly, they have the potential 
to grow up, flourish, and achieve amaz-
ing dreams. Let us have the compas-
sion to give them that chance. 
For those of us in elected office who 
sincerely believe that human life is a 
sacred gift from God in need of soci-
ety’s protection, our position is no

longer theoretical. We now have a 
pressing responsibility to examine how 
public policy can best be crafted to 
adequately accomplish our stated goal. 
I believe we already have an answer. 
When an expectant mother visits a doc-
tor for an ultrasound, the image of a 
beating heart is the first confirmation 
that a child has been conceived. When 
someone is involved in a severe acci-
dent, a medic will check right away to 
see if there is a pulse to make sure the 
victim is alive. In short, a heartbeat 
means a life. 
Now, to legislate consistently with 
this truth, I introduced the Heartbeat 
Protection Act in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. This bill would le-
gally prohibit future abortions from 
being performed if a preborn child’s 
heartbeat can be detected, with the ex-
ception for when a mother’s life is in 
danger. It is a science-based, human-
ity-respecting solution suited to the 
new landscape in which we find our-
selves. 
The post-Roe world is here. As legis-
lators in each State determine the ex-
tent to which they wish to defend life, 
pro-life Members of Congress can si-
multaneously take action to make our 
beloved country a place where both 
children waiting to be born and their 
mothers are acknowledged and safe-
guarded. 
Mr. Speaker, tonight, we have a very 
distinguished group of Members with 
us who will also speak on this subject. 
This doesn’t have to turn into an angry 
debate. This doesn’t have to turn into 
something that people get so upset 
with each other about that they can’t 
even sit down and talk intelligently 
about what is going on. 
If we cannot see the value of life 
every day in every single person, then 
what have we witnessed this year, just 
this summer—the horror that has 
taken place in our own cities, the loss 
of life that we have experienced, the 
sincere sorrow that this country feels. 
Yet, we have a blind eye and a deaf ear 
to the cries of the unborn. 
Do they not deserve that same type 
of consideration that every human 
being deserves? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN). 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for 
holding this very serious and very im-
portant Special Order. 
A few weeks ago, the Supreme Court 
delivered the greatest victory for life 
this country has ever seen when it 
rightly held that the ability to kill an 
unborn child is not a constitutional 
right and returned the authority to 
regulate abortion back to the people 
and their elected Representatives. 
Sadly, we have seen some elected of-
ficials who care more about appeasing 
the fringes of their base than defending 
our institution and respecting the doc-
ument that they swore to uphold and 
defend. 
President 
Biden, 
for 
example, 
a 
former longtime supporter of letting 
the States decide their abortion poli-
cies, he sees fit to ignore the ruling. In 
a feeble attempt to quiet his far-left 
critics, he is seeking to unilaterally ex-
pand the ability to kill an unborn 
child. 
I am curious. Does he not know that 
we have rule of law in this country 
with a system actually built on checks 
and balances? The President has been 
in Washington since before Roe, so I 
think he should at least have a basic 
understanding of our government and 
the rule of law. 
I would say this: Mr. President, these 
efforts will be in vain. You must re-
member the oath that you took and 
the document you swore to uphold. Mr. 
President, the Supreme Court and the 
Constitution are clear: You and your 
bureaucratic underlings at HHS do not 
have the authority to unilaterally 
make law. That is up to the people’s 
Representatives. 
Please 
remember 
that. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY) 
for this Special Order. 
The Supreme Court’s monumental 
overturn of Roe v. Wade is a milestone 
we have been working on for nearly 
half a century. However, our work has 
only just begun. 
Since the Court’s ruling, pro-abor-
tion extremists have attacked, vandal-
ized, and even firebombed pregnancy 
centers and churches across this coun-
try. 
Since 2016, pregnancy help centers 
have saved more than 800,000 lives by 
providing critical resources for women 
and their children. They should never 
be forced to operate under the threat of 
violence from anarchists who do not 
value life or our laws. 
I have introduced H. Res. 1183, which 
condemns these attacks and the domes-
tic terrorists behind them. 
We must keep fighting to protect the 
unborn from those who wish to extin-
guish them at all costs. 
I am a proud supporter of such an ef-
fort, the Heartbeat Protection Act, 
which prohibits abortions from the mo-
ment a child’s heartbeat is detected. 
All babies deserve a chance at life, and 
we must defend that chance and that 
life. 
My colleagues across the aisle have 
disturbingly 
embraced 
an 
anti-life 
agenda so radical that it sadistically 
enables the murder of millions. 
This week, our colleagues across the 
aisle are pushing the abortion on de-
mand until birth act, a bill that legal-
izes abortion on demand for any reason 
and at any time. They don’t care that 
their pro-abortion agenda fails to align 
with the views of the majority of 
Americans—71 percent, to be exact— 
who support some limitations on abor-
tion. 
We cannot and must not remain si-
lent while the lives of the most inno-
cent among us are threatened to be ter-
minated. 
Mr. Speaker, I will always stand for 
our unborn and firmly stand against 
any efforts to promote abortion. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
JOYCE), 
another 
member of the fantastic Pennsylvania 
conference group and a strong defender 
of life. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I thank Represent-
ative MIKE KELLY for holding this Spe-
cial Order. 
What a pivotal summer we have seen 
as the United States Supreme Court, 
after almost five decades, has over-
ruled the terror of Roe v. Wade. 
We all know that all life is sacred. As 
a doctor, I swore an oath first to do no 
harm, and for me as a doctor, that 
meant refusing to ever be involved in 
performing abortions or any abortion 
procedures. Now, as a legislator, it 
means working each and every day to 
protect and stand for human life. 
Even after this historic Supreme 
Court decision to overturn Roe v. 
Wade, there is still work to be done to 
protect human life here in the United 
States. Our Declaration of Independ-
ence states that life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness are unalienable 
rights given to all of us by our creator, 
and government is created to protect 
these rights. Government is created to 
protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. 
We must all, as legislators, stand for 
life, and we must continue to fight for 
the unborn. 
The sanctity of human life is an in-
herent part of America from our found-
ing days, and it must be protected 
today and into the future. 
Again, I thank the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania, my colleague and my 
friend, for doing this Special Order this 
evening and allowing all of America to 
hear how we stand behind the sanctity 
of human life. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON), a member of 
the Republican leadership group. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
important voice and for hosting this 
Special Order hour. 
The sanctity of human life can never 
be overemphasized. The gentleman has 
done so much work in that arena, and 
I appreciate him. 
I am thankful to our Democratic col-
leagues tonight, as well, for skipping 
their Special Order hour so we can just 
go right ahead and get started in prime 
time. If America were experiencing 
record inflation, sky-high gas prices, 
and uninhibited illegal immigration 
under our watch, I would probably 
yield my time back, as well. 
Mr. Speaker, this morning in our Ju-
diciary Committee, the Democrat ma-
jority convened a hearing, and they ti-
tled it: ‘‘What’s Next: The Threat to 
Individual Freedoms in a Post-Roe 
World.’’ It was an appropriate title, in-
deed, because the radical abortion ad-
vocates are becoming completely un-
hinged. They are seeking to trample on

the individual freedoms of anybody 
who disagrees with them. 
Case in point, over the weekend, the 
leftwing activist group ShutDownDC 
offered 
$200 
bounties 
for 
public 
sightings of our Supreme Court Jus-
tices. 
This week, Senator ELIZABETH WAR-
REN—talk about unhinged—said that 
crisis pregnancy centers all across 
America should be shut down. 
There are 2,700 pregnancy centers all 
around this country in all 50 States. 
They are supported by over 10,000 li-
censed medical professionals. They are 
annually serving approximately 2 mil-
lion women and men. I used to serve as 
legal counsel for many of these organi-
zations, and I can testify to their in-
valuable work. 
Why would anybody want to shut 
down pregnancy centers? They exist to 
provide counseling, care, aid, and com-
fort to struggling mothers who just 
want to have their babies. This is just 
abhorrent. 
b 1930 
Speaking of abhorrent, I suggest to 
my Democrat friends to study up to-
night—really, I mean, seriously—on 
the bill that we are going to be voting 
on here tomorrow. They call it the 
Women’s Protection Act. It is not. We 
call it, more appropriately, abortion on 
demand until birth act. 
Even though this will be the second 
time we voted on this bill in this Con-
gress, I am not sure they know what is 
in it. I keep hearing my Democrat col-
leagues tell us: Oh, no, it is not about 
abortion on demand until birth. It ab-
solutely is. 
Surely, if they knew that this legis-
lation did this, they wouldn’t support 
it, right? 
The American people certainly don’t 
support it. 
To our Democrat colleagues tonight, 
as I yield back to my friend, I would 
just humbly suggest—read your bill. 
You got a few hours. Read your legisla-
tion. Search your conscience. I hope 
that you will do the right thing and 
vote against that bill tomorrow. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. KELLY 
again for the Special Order hour. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. JOHNSON. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA). I think 
we came into Congress in 2011 and it 
has been a pleasure serving with you. I 
appreciate your comments tonight on 
this very important issue. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate Mr. KELLY’s leadership that he is 
providing for us here tonight and all 
through the year and all through your 
tenure here on this key moral issue. 
I am glad also to join the rest of my 
pro-life colleagues here to reaffirm our 
dedication to protecting the innocent 
unborn. 
Indeed, we have cause for celebra-
tion, something that has been cor-
rected, over nearly 50 years and over 50 
million lives taken, the unconstitu-
tional Roe decision has been rightfully 
overturned and the power put back to 
the States to a legislative process, not 
one decided by seven of nine on a Su-
preme Court. 
Indeed, now we can have debate and 
people can be accountable for their 
votes. The public can have input on 
what they think about this topic. The 
public is much more educated at this 
point than they were 50 years ago and 
what this really means. 
Every pregnancy actually results in a 
human life in that pregnancy. It is not 
something else. It is not a blob. It is 
not a tissue mass. It isn’t going to be 
some other form of life or an animal— 
this is a human life we are talking 
about, and we value that and we pro-
tect that. It is constitutional to pro-
tect life in this country. 
Though that decision does not outlaw 
abortion, it puts the responsibility and 
accountability back to legislatures, 
whether it is going to be States or here 
in the U.S. Capitol. 
They still pushed forward anyway 
with a determination to go even far-
ther than Roe v. Wade—their abortion 
on demand bill that they are going to 
take up tomorrow. It provides for dis-
cretionary abortions at any point in a 
pregnancy on the basis of a baby’s sex, 
race, or possible disability. 
What are we doing here? 
We must stop the left’s radical, ex-
treme, immoral abortion agenda and 
uphold the value and dignity and po-
tential of every person’s life. 
We even see now that corporations 
want to pay for travel for abortions for 
their employees. Amazing. They think 
this is helping women—$4,000 is pos-
sible for your travel. 
We have States that also want to be 
abortion tourism centers. My home 
State of California, shamefully, is try-
ing to draw people in, pay for their 
stay, pay for their travel—even for ille-
gal immigrants. 
How immoral can you be? 
Each one of these innocent souls was 
created by God. We see this immoral 
decay of our country, and it is really 
coming to fruition right in bright col-
ors in front of all of us. 
There is no denying that what we are 
talking about is a human life. As early 
as 5 weeks in the womb babies have a 
heartbeat; 10 weeks, arms, legs, fingers 
and toes, and they can jump and kick 
even inside the womb; 15 weeks, fully 
developed hearts, they can taste, yawn, 
and hiccup. Indeed, they are real. 
It is not some blob. It is not some-
thing to be dismissed. What we are see-
ing here with the overturning of this 
decision, is the responsibility is back 
in front of the people to have this de-
bate, and it is going to be a serious de-
bate with all the States that are going 
to take this up, and here in Congress. 
My hat is off to all the people that 
have worked so hard all these years— 
those pro-life folks out there—making 
the case, pleading, praying, and work-
ing so hard to educate about the mir-
acle that is life. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN), my friend 
and a strong defender of life. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, our 
country was sent on a journey a week 
ago to see how we would respond to the 
Dobbs decision. This decision chal-
lenges all Americans to decide where 
they will stand on the abortion issue. 
It is particularly a challenge to the 
churches of this country who are sup-
posed to provide moral guidance to the 
country as to where to stand. 
These are decisions that will have to 
be made by the citizens, in part, when 
they vote. Decisions have to be made 
by State legislators, district attorneys 
as to whether they are going to uphold 
pro-life laws, and perhaps, most impor-
tant of all, individual decisions that 
are going to have to be made by women 
or families who are in a situation in 
which some people are going to try to 
persuade them to have an abortion. 
It is interesting when we talk about 
this to remember that in 1973, as far as 
I can determine, no State between 
California on the West Coast and New 
York on the East Coast had entirely 
open-ended pro-abortion laws. Never-
theless, at a time where we didn’t real-
ly have ultrasounds, every other State 
ruled that something barbaric was 
going on. 
You just heard other statistics—we 
know at 6 weeks a child has a heart-
beat; 7 weeks, feels pain; 10 weeks, 
jumps if startled, and has fingers and 
toes; 15 weeks, sense of taste. 
Obviously, anybody who says: What 
would God want us to do in this situa-
tion realizes a human being has been 
created by God, and that human being 
should be cherished and kept alive. 
It was, again, apparently the clergy 
in 1973, or society as a whole, did a 
good job of informing people that 
something so horrific was happening in 
abortion that it should be barred and 
made illegal. Since that time, the cler-
gy of this country and the churches of 
this country have had 49 years to weigh 
in with the public and guide them as to 
how they should think. We are soon 
going to find out what a good job they 
did or a bad job they did. 
In any event, we thank the Supreme 
Court for reaching the right decision. 
Now we put the ball in the court of 
Americans as a whole, whether they 
will respond, recognizing the precious 
lives that we have to protect in Amer-
ica, or if they are going down the shoot 
toward more of an atheistic view of the 
world, similar to countries like North 
Korea, Red China, countries in which 
atheism is part of their roots. 
The challenge is yours, America—the 
challenge to the churches. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. GROTHMAN. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), a great con-
sistent defender of life. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
KELLY for holding this Special Order 
and I thank him for his leadership on

July 14, 2022 
this incredibly important issue, par-
ticularly the heartbeat bill. 
The heartbeat bill criminalizes an 
abortion that is performed after know-
ingly determining that a fetus has a 
detectable heartbeat. 
The Democrats have the most radical 
position on abortion. They have zero 
regard for life. It is so radical that they 
want to shut down all crisis pregnancy 
centers in America. These centers help 
pregnant mothers in need and after the 
child is born. 
Tomorrow, they plan to pass a piece 
of legislation that will strip away 
every protection for children in the 
womb, the protection for their mothers 
and healthcare providers. 
It would allow abortion up until 
birth, and it could be used for sex selec-
tion. If it is signed into law, we will be-
come the most barbarous country in 
the world with regard to abortion— 
more radical than even China, North 
Korea, or Vietnam, which have no limi-
tations. 
Well, what do we have now? 
We have States that could regulate 
this now, and they do. So it is a lie to 
say that you don’t have abortions in 
these States. Here is the deal. Even in 
France they regulate it and it is pre-
vented after 14 weeks; Germany after 
12 weeks, Greece after 12 weeks, Hun-
gary after 12 weeks, Ireland after 12 
weeks, and it goes on and on in the EU. 
The United States—if this bill passes 
tomorrow—will be the most barbarous 
to unborn babies in the world. I hope 
and pray that doesn’t happen. It must 
not happen in a civilized country like 
the United States, I pray it won’t. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. BIGGS. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MANN), another great 
defender of pro-life and consistent 
member of pro-life. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
for 
hosting this very important Special 
Order hour, it is a hard-pressed thing 
and there is nothing more important 
that we can talk about right now. 
I rise tonight to use my voice in de-
fense of the voiceless, the unborn. 
Abortion has desensitized our Nation 
and I pray that the recent Supreme 
Court ruling wakes up our country to 
the horrors that we have visited upon 
our country’s most vulnerable citizens 
whose lives have been snuffed out by 
abortion. 
By 12 weeks of age, a baby has fully 
formed arms, hands, fingers, feet, and 
toes, a fully functional circulatory sys-
tem and liver, and the capacity to ex-
perience pain—all at the weight of just 
1 ounce and the length of 4 inches. 
This is a miracle of God, and rather 
than stand in awe of it, some law-
makers would rather disregard it as 
meaningless. Abortion is not simply an 
elected medical procedure like getting 
your wisdom teeth taken out. There is 
another person involved—another eter-
nal soul whom God created, loves, and 
sent his son, Jesus, to die for so that 
they might live. 
The Supreme Court finally rectified 
their unthinkable wrong from 50 years 
ago, when the court legislated from the 
bench with Roe v. Wade and declared 
abortion a constitutional right ground-
ed in a woman’s right to privacy—a ju-
risprudential move that was shaky, bi-
ased, and flat wrong. 
The United States is one of only 
eight countries in the world that per-
mit abortion after 20 weeks of gesta-
tion, which means that 95 percent of 
the countries on Earth think that we 
are dead wrong on abortion. Now, as 
the Supreme Court has finally handed 
this decision back to the States, Amer-
icans will get to decide for themselves 
how abortion should be regulated. 
It is easy to get caught up in the leg-
islative language and forget that the 
numbers involved in the abortion issue 
are actual human beings. In the United 
States, 
63.4 
million 
people—Ameri-
cans—have died from abortion over the 
last 50 years. 
To put that number into context, 
that is roughly the entire population of 
the Midwest, which is estimated at 65 
million people. Think about that. 
Would our country notice if the col-
lective populations of Kansas, Iowa, 
Missouri, Minnesota, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, Indi-
ana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin 
were wiped out overnight? Would they 
miss these people? 
That is the impact that abortion has 
had over the past 50 years. 
I believe that life begins at concep-
tion, which is why I support adoptions, 
foster care, and crisis pregnancy cen-
ters that work tirelessly to care for 
mothers and their babies. 
I take this moment to thank the pro- 
life movement at large in American 
and I am standing with you and thank-
ing God that Roe v. Wade has finally 
been overturned. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), somebody who 
has been a friend of mine since way 
back in 2011, and who has never stopped 
fighting for life since he got here. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend for having and hosting this 
time. 
During biblical times, we read about 
sacrifices of babies to Moloch and to 
Baal. 
How could that happen? How could 
you allow a child—a tiny baby—to suf-
fer like that? It goes on. 
I know there is so much said, but 
let’s simplify it. If you think that it is 
not a child, see a preemie. It doesn’t 
have to be your own premature child 
like ours was. Let that little child grab 
your finger and hold on for dear life. 
Understand what we have heard about 
here—what a late-term abortion is that 
so many in this body embrace. 
b 1945 
That little hand is attached to an 
arm that is attached to a body, and it 
is a beautiful child. The late-term 
abortionist, as he has explained, will 
rip off—he reaches in with a clamp, 
clamps on to the arm, linear things, 
and rips off four linear things from the 
body and then reaches in and crushes 
the skull and rips the skull off of the 
child. 
That is not progress for civilization. 
That is horrendous. 
Let a premature child hold your fin-
ger, Mr. Speaker, and see what the 
monitors do—as I have—and you will 
never ever want to know of a child like 
that being broken, pulled, and torn 
apart. Let’s progress beyond the bru-
tality. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
the great State of Georgia (Mr. CAR-
TER), who is another great defender of 
life. 
We have been defending life for so 
long with such great patience and such 
great prayer. It has always been done 
in a peaceful manner. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, in the 1970s when Roe v. 
Wade was decided, ultrasound tech-
nology was in its infancy. The black 
and white photos that expectant par-
ents proudly display on their refrig-
erators and in social media posts today 
weren’t widely available back then. 
The general public could not see the 
life that was being created, and the 
medical community had no clear con-
sensus on when life began. 
I have been blessed with many beau-
tiful grandchildren, and I remember 
the warmth and love I felt for them the 
second I saw those 15-week ultrasound 
photos. I am beyond grateful. In fact, it 
is an answer to many prayers that our 
Supreme Court has finally made a deci-
sion and has overturned the cata-
strophic decision that was Roe v. Wade. 
What the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization decision does is 
give the power back to the States 
where it belongs, allowing them to de-
cide how they want to approach abor-
tion law. But it doesn’t stop here. We 
must now refocus our attention in a 
post-Roe world, to providing aid to our 
mothers. 
Now, this is very important, Mr. 
Speaker. The Biden administration has 
recently come out targeting phar-
macists such as myself, trying to force 
them to distribute abortion medication 
at the risk of civil rights violations. 
When I was a member of the Georgia 
State legislature, I sponsored legisla-
tion to allow pharmacists to act in the 
best interest of their patient. 
President Biden is using pharmacists 
as political pawns for his pro-abortion 
agenda. That is truly despicable. This 
is not the kind of leadership that 
should be coming out of the White 
House. 
Life is the most fundamental human 
right; we must continue to work to 
help make it the best that it can be. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
the great State of Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Again, I thank the Representative for

being with us tonight. He is a great de-
fender of life. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend, MIKE KELLY of Pennsylvania, 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe everyone has 
the dignity, value, and potential. There 
is no right more fundamental than the 
right to life. Our Founders engraved it 
in the Constitution. We are made in 
God’s image, and we carry in our 
hearts that spark of creation that 
served as the bedrock upon which our 
country was founded. 
Documents like the Constitution do 
not grant rights, they protect rights. 
The Dobbs v. Jackson decision will go 
down in history not only as the end of 
one era but the dawn of another more 
hopeful one. 
The decision that the Court made 
was based on the 14th Amendment and 
the civil rights of a woman and her re-
productive rights. The decision was 
controversial. It is not in the Constitu-
tion, and it was a terrible decision. It 
was decided based on the civil rights of 
the mother. 
We know that the child has a heart-
beat in 6 weeks and can feel pain at 15 
weeks which was the Mississippi law 
that it was contested on. And we know 
a child born at 24 weeks will survive. 
My question is: When does that child 
enjoy the same rights under the 14th 
Amendment as the mother? 
Is it at conception? 
Is it at 6 weeks, the heartbeat, which 
Georgia law is based on? 
Or is it the Mississippi law or when 
that child is born maybe prematurely 
at 24 weeks? 
This is God’s Word. God told Jere-
miah that He knew him before He 
webbed him in the womb. 
What my colleagues are proposing to-
morrow on the House floor goes far be-
yond Roe. This legislation, if codified 
into law, would require healthcare pro-
viders at the command of the mother 
to rip a full-term baby from the womb 
while the mother is in labor; if the 
baby likely survives, orders the child 
to be killed. 
This is unconscionable and barbaric 
and must be stopped. Only eight na-
tions, as has been said earlier, allow 
this barbaric practice; two of them are 
North Korea and China. We are not in 
good company here. 
I cry out to my colleagues to stop 
this insanity. Let us all enjoy life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness— 
even the defenseless unborn. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Representative 
for his remarks. Tomorrow is a big day 
for all of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the great State of Mississippi (Mr. 
GUEST). As we all ponder tonight what 
tomorrow will bring, I thank Mr. 
GUEST for being with us and defending 
life in every step of the way. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the life of the un-
born and in support of pro-life legisla-
tion like the Heartbeat Protection Act, 
a commonsense bill that would save an 
untold number of unborn children. I en-
courage my colleagues to look at the 
evidence that supports the pro-life 
movement. 
I know that Scripture supports life. 
Jeremiah 1:5 tells us: 
Before I formed you in the womb, I knew 
you. Before you were born, I set you apart. 
We also know that science supports 
life. Science now proves that unborn 
children can feel pain starting at 15 
weeks 
or 
earlier. 
With 
enhanced 
ultrasound technology we see children 
in the womb moving and kicking. With 
new technology, doctors can even de-
tect the beating sound of a child’s 
heart. 
Our Court supports life with the re-
cent decision by the Court to support 
Dobbs v. Jackson, which is a case that 
originated in the great State of Mis-
sissippi, my home State, we now have a 
legal system that has opened the door 
for a wave of pro-life support. 
The American people also support 
life. Almost two out of every three 
Americans 
support 
restrictions 
on 
abortion. Twenty-one States have al-
ready implemented laws to protect the 
lives of unborn children. That will now 
grow even further with nine more 
States considering their own pro-life 
legislation in the coming months. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support Scripture, science, our legal 
systems, our States, the American peo-
ple, and the lives of our unborn chil-
dren by supporting the pro-life move-
ment. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Representative 
for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the great State of Tennessee (Mr. 
ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Rep-
resentative KELLY for sponsoring this 
Special Order tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, on Friday of last week, 
President Biden signed an executive 
order 
undermining 
democratically 
passed State laws that limit abortions. 
His executive order directs the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services to 
protect access to life-ending abortions 
including the dangerous and deadly 
chemical abortion pill. This goes di-
rectly against the Supreme Court’s re-
cent decision that allows the people 
through their elected Representatives 
to decide on this issue for themselves 
at the many States. 
Unfortunately, the President caved 
to the extremists who support abortion 
up until the moment of birth and is 
now going against his oath of office by 
directly undermining the law of the 
land. Meanwhile, pregnancy centers, 
which provide compassionate support 
to pregnant mothers, and churches are 
under attack by the left. 
Where is the executive order pro-
tecting these organizations and insti-
tutions? 
In America, the first inalienable 
right is the right to be born—the right 
to life. Countless lives have been lost 
to abortion since Roe became law. Now 
is our time to right these wrongs and 
stand for life. The President has a con-
stitutional duty to uphold the law of 
the land, not undermine it. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate Representative 
ROSE’s being here tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I will use some of the 
time we have remaining. I know that 
we always want to debate this proposed 
legislation about what is good about it 
and what is bad about it. Oftentimes, 
we use languages to actually disguise 
what it is that we are actually talking 
about. 
Tomorrow as we will debate and vote 
on the Women’s Health Protection Act, 
abortion is the only medical procedure 
where two people go into the doctor’s 
office and only one comes out alive. I 
know that in this people’s House we 
have had heavy debate, and I know 
that both sides are divided on it and 
sometimes the language gets out of 
hand. It gets too hateful. 
My colleagues on the other side have 
often said to me: 
Look, we believe like you believe. We be-
lieve that life is sacred. We believe that 
every—every—child has a chance, and that 
unborn child is waiting to be born and wait-
ing to experience all that life has to offer. 
But, you see, the Supreme Court took that 
option away from me. My personal pref-
erence would be life, but the Supreme Court 
took that option away from me. 
So tomorrow, as we debate the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act and we hear 
a lot of discussion that goes back and 
forth and defending and then tearing 
apart and people adding to and sub-
tracting from, we come to a lot of dif-
ferent things. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to share 
with you that last weekend while we 
were home, I had the opportunity to 
visit in Erie, Pennsylvania, in the dis-
trict that I represent, I visited a wom-
en’s care center. This is a center where 
too often they are described as people 
who are trying to discourage pregnant 
mothers from actually giving birth. 
They are trying to lead them into a dif-
ferent direction. 
I just want to say this: the people 
who man these agencies give up a day 
of their life to come in and help coun-
sel women who are going probably 
through some of the most difficult 
times of their life. Maybe it is not the 
right time for them to have that child. 
Maybe there is a financial problem, 
and it is just not right right now. 
Maybe there is something else that 
stands in their way, and they are say-
ing: Well, I am so alone. I am by my-
self. I don’t know how I would handle 
this. 
To those ladies who go through that, 
I would say that there are options 
available to you. The adoption option 
is there. We have thousands upon thou-
sands of people who would love to 
adopt a child and to give it a loving 
home and to help nurture it as it goes 
through its lifecycles. We also have 
foster care that is available. 
I know that I have talked to too 
many women who have experienced the

anguish of going through an abortion 
and then later on thinking that they 
made the biggest mistake of their life 
and holding that guilt feeling in their 
life. 
I would just like to suggest that we 
are a very forgiving society. We are a 
people who say: 
Look, don’t let that ruin your life. Don’t 
let that ruin your life. There is forgiveness, 
there is grace, and there is mercy. 
We know that. But as we stand here 
tonight in the people’s House—in the 
people’s House—how did we ever get to 
this point? 
How did we ever in the United States 
of America decide that all life is not 
precious? 
I mentioned earlier some of the hor-
rific instances that have taken place 
just in the last few weeks, in the last 
few months, and in the last few years. 
b 2000 
I know that, on Wednesdays, a lot of 
Representatives wear red, and that is 
to bring about the remembrance of the 
Boko Haram and the little girls who 
were kidnapped and never returned. It 
is always about ‘‘we need to get our 
girls back.’’ 
We have such open hearts, and we 
have such understanding in some cases. 
Then in other cases, we just close our 
eyes. We plug our ears. We say: No, no. 
You don’t understand. In this situa-
tion, the conception of that child was 
not what we were looking for. That is 
not what we wanted, but it happened, 
and now we have a problem. What are 
we going to do with this little girl or 
this little boy? 
I know people look away. They look 
to the sky, and they look to the walls, 
and they look to the floor, and they 
say: Look, my personal preference 
would be—but the Supreme Court made 
a decision. The Supreme Court has just 
righted a very wrong decision. 
I hope that, at some point, the great-
est defender of life in the history of the 
world, the greatest defender of liberty 
and freedom in the history of the 
world, the United States of America, 
would take a look at the course and 
the direction it has been taking for the 
last 50 years. 
Millions upon millions upon millions 
of little boys and little girls have been 
denied the right to life. Where in our 
history did we ever come up with this 
idea that abortion is okay? 
Look, I said earlier, I understand 
there are times in your life—I can just 
tell you this: As a father of four and a 
grandfather of 10, between our first-
born child and our second-born child, 
there was a pregnancy that took place. 
It was an ectopic pregnancy. My wife 
has wondered forever what that child 
would have been like had she gone full 
term. 
I want to take a moment, Mr. Speak-
er, as we close now. In this building, in 
this room, in this town, tomorrow, we 
will have a chance to look at what it is 
we are doing and where we are going. I 
would just ask it all to be prayerful, 
peaceful, and understand that this is 
an issue that we can no longer close 
our eyes to. 
If it is your personal preference, if it 
is something that you think is right 
for life, then, please, walk away from 
any political bend that you may have 
and look at the policies. 
We are here for the best interests of 
the United States and the best inter-
ests of our American citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you so much for 
your indulgence. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
BEING A MORAL AND RELIGIOUS 
COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, just so you all know, you don’t 
have to worry about waiting 30 min-
utes. It is not going to be that long. 
I would like to talk about some 
issues tonight that I don’t feel have 
been 
adequately 
addressed 
in 
this 
forum. The press—not the people back 
home, but the press—keeps trying to 
make a big deal out of January 6. 
When I go home, as I am sure for all 
of my colleagues who go home, 80 per-
cent of the comments deal with infla-
tion, insofar as other things are being 
dealt with. It is not January 6. 
Nevertheless, there is something that 
bothers me. Since we are apparently 
going to have these hearings on Janu-
ary 6, everything ought to be able to 
come out. If I was on that committee, 
the first thing I would ask is for all the 
video from the Capitol that day to be 
released. 
It seems to me if people genuinely 
want to know what is going on, that is 
where I would start. Therefore, on last 
October 5, myself, Congressman NOR-
MAN, and Congressman GOHMERT asked 
for all the video from the Capitol to be 
released that day. It doesn’t seem that 
much of a difficult request. There were 
many people still being held in jail, 
and the press kept trying to rile up the 
population and let them believe some-
thing horrible had happened. 
I received inquiries from both Repub-
lican and Democrat constituents who 
felt it would be a good idea if we re-
leased the video of what was going on 
that day. It would be helpful if Con-
gresswoman 
LIZ
CHENEY
or 
ADAM 
KINZINGER also weighed in, saying all 
that video should be released. But for 
whatever reason, it hasn’t been re-
leased. 
One more time, Congressmen Nor-
man, Gohmert, and myself have had to 
make a request of the Justice Depart-
ment to release these videos. It is get-
ting to the point where no longer is it 
just an innocent inquiry because a few 
people asked for it. People are begin-
ning to think that the Justice Depart-
ment must be hiding something. 
One more time, we make the request. 
The request should be made by the 
Capitol press corps. There was a time 
when press in this country, one of their 
goals was to get behind the curtain in 
front of government and expose what 
was really going on, and both conserv-
ative and liberal journalists would 
have quickly asked for these videos. 
For whatever reason, they haven’t 
asked for them. 
I, again, ask the Department of Jus-
tice to release them. But above all, be-
cause I don’t think the Justice Depart-
ment apparently cares what Congress-
men Norman, Gohmert, or Grothman 
say, the press in this country that 
seems obsessed with January 6 ought 
to demand that the Justice Depart-
ment release these videos. After all, it 
has been 16 months, 17 months, after 
this took place. It has been 18 months 
after this took place. It is high time we 
found out what was going on there. 
Every day that goes forward in which 
the video is not released, I think the 
American public, the small amount 
that is paying attention, is going to be 
more convinced that somebody is hid-
ing something. 
Now, I don’t want to accuse anybody 
of anything. I don’t want to be a con-
spiracy theorist, but my constituents 
are wondering, when I write that let-
ter, why we are sitting on the video. If 
it is so important to find out what 
really went on that day, please, De-
partment of Justice, release the hidden 
videos and, please, comatose American 
press corps, ask that the videos be re-
leased. 
I have spoken from this microphone 
many times this biennium about a tilt 
toward the totalitarian sort of govern-
ment that we see going on. And by to-
talitarian, I mean the worst type of to-
talitarian, a Marxist totalitarian gov-
ernment. 
We see a variety of danger signs on 
the horizon. We began this session with 
people being sworn in who, in order to 
get elected, got help from Black Lives 
Matter, a group whose founders made 
no bones about the fact that they were 
Marxist and made no bones about the 
fact that they were against the tradi-
tional American family, what they de-
scribed as the Western nuclear family. 
We have then seen online media gi-
ants suppress free speech. Now, I sup-
pose you could say they are private 
companies, and I suppose you could say 
it is their right to suppress free speech 
or prevent you from googling some-
thing, from getting a cross section of 
views that are out there. 
Nevertheless, we know, as a practical 
matter, they have almost a monopoly 
in this country, and it is concerning 
that these companies that have, as a 
practical matter, monopolies have de-
cided to suppress certain speech. They 
certainly have the heart of a totali-
tarian atheist. 
The next thing we look at is a grow-
ing percentage of the gross national 
product no longer being spent by the 
people who earn the money but being 
spent by the government, by the politi-
cians in Washington. That is another 
danger sign.

July 14, 2022 
We see a President openly talking 
about taking away the freedom to de-
fend yourself. He wants the only guns 
to be owned by government employees. 
He didn’t want the right of defense to 
rest with the individual. This would be 
another trait of a government very dif-
ferent from that which our forefathers 
anticipated. 
We saw an effort made to have our 
government deny visas or deny prop-
erty to foreigners if they engaged in 
suppression of human rights. But the 
human rights that we know the Biden 
administration meant were not fear of 
murder or robbery or something. The 
human rights were aimed at the field of 
pro-life, so that politicians or other 
people abroad who fought for pro-life 
issues, or issues with regard to so- 
called gay rights, if you weren’t on the 
right side, the Biden administration 
wanted to threaten foreign officials 
with taking away the right for a visa 
in this country, taking away their 
right to travel, as well as taking away 
their property in this country. 
Does that sound like kind of a dan-
gerous thing? 
America had better wake up. We are 
going the wrong way. John Adams said 
our Constitution is made for a moral 
and religious people and is totally unfit 
for any other kind. 
When you listen to the things that 
have been going on in this country, 
what do you think? Aren’t we headed 
for a very different country than the 
moral and religious country that is re-
quired to keep our country going? 
There are other things that kind of 
just amaze me. June is Dairy Month. 
Being from Wisconsin, everybody in 
Wisconsin knows June is Dairy Month. 
But for some people around Wash-
ington, they don’t think primarily of 
Dairy Month. They call it Pride Month, 
and the U.S. flies the gay flag, and the 
Vatican, as well as many other coun-
tries around the world. 
Do you think our forefathers would 
have anticipated, particularly given all 
the blessings that our country has been 
given, that we would decide to fly our 
flag with, in essence, a sexual pref-
erence flag all around the world? 
Again, highly questionable. 
Then, we have another step in a very 
unusual direction for a country that 
was supposed to be a moral and reli-
gious country. We are sending out re-
quests 
for 
grants 
from 
nonprofits 
around the world to promote human-
ism and atheism. Isn’t that kind of un-
usual? 
Here we are, such a blessed country. 
What do we do with our money? Why, 
we say, does anybody around the world 
want to promote atheism? 
As recently as the 1960s in this coun-
try, only 2 percent of the people said 
they did not believe in God, only 2 per-
cent in the 1960s. Look how far down 
we have gone. Now, we elect a govern-
ment and are asking for grants to be 
given to organizations to promote 
atheism in our name. 
I mean, when you look at the State 
Department, I guess the two things 
that they will tell people abroad are, if 
you want to be like the United States, 
if you want to follow in its footsteps, 
follow the pride flag and follow athe-
ism. Very, very disappointing. I think 
it is time that the clergy and the peo-
ple of America wake up. 
I know we are just supposed to talk 
about inflation. Of course, inflation is 
bad, and, of course, this bad inflation 
was caused by excessive government 
spending. That is all true. But there 
are other issues that are going on out 
there as well, and I am very afraid, 
given how quickly we have gone down-
hill the last 40 or 20 or 10 years, where 
we are going to wind up in another 10 
or 20 or 30 years if this sort of activity 
continues to come from our govern-
ment in Washington. 
While we took our 2-week break, we 
hit 100 murders a year in the city of 
Milwaukee. If that happens in the sec-
ond half of the year, we are going to 
wind up hitting the all-time-record 
number of murders in Milwaukee, a 
city that is directly adjacent to my 
district. 
We have to ask ourselves, what can 
we do to reduce the number of mur-
ders? Part of it, I have always felt, is 
the decline in the traditional family. 
We have spoken, again, from this 
microphone about the degree to which 
our welfare programs seem conditioned 
upon either not working or, above all, 
make sure if you have children, you 
don’t have them in wedlock because if 
you have a two-earner household, it is 
very difficult to take advantage of all 
these grants. 
b 2015 
Mr. Speaker, this is where some of it 
comes from, but some of it also comes 
from kind of the neutering of the police 
corps by having irresponsible politi-
cians calling the police, in general, rac-
ists. 
When you call all the police racists, 
which I don’t think they are, you cre-
ate a chilling influence. Police, par-
ticularly in big cities with high crime 
rates, where it may be more important 
they engage the citizenry than any-
where else, the police back off. When 
they back off, you have something that 
is almost unbelievable to see: a hun-
dred murders in the first half of the 
year in the city of Milwaukee. 
By the way, I was born in the city of 
Milwaukee, and as recently as the 
early 1970s, Milwaukee had the lowest 
murder rate of the 20 biggest cities in 
the country. 
Milwaukee was always proud of how 
safe it was, and now we are kind of 
going the opposite way quickly. At 
least I believe one of the reasons is cer-
tain politicians. It has become politi-
cally expedient for them to trash the 
police 
departments, 
to, 
therefore, 
threaten individual police with law-
suits, resulting in police not engaging 
the population enough and resulting in 
a high number of murders. 
I, therefore, call upon all of our poli-
ticians to boldly speak out in favor of 
the police and boldly describe to the 
population as a whole that we do not 
have a racist country, which is some-
thing else that should be pointed out. 
In my own district, I talk to the 
Hmong, who came here not even know-
ing the language. If you talk to the 
Hmong, all of their children and their 
grandchildren are doing fantastically 
well, living the American Dream. 
I know an increasing number of peo-
ple from India in my district, another 
example of a group that frequently 
came to America, didn’t know the na-
tive language, and now they are living 
the American Dream. 
But for some reason—I personally be-
lieve they are trying to destroy Amer-
ica—politicians are out there talking 
about what a horrible, racist country 
they have. 
I think they do it to divide America 
and weaken America, but I beg them to 
stop doing it that way and to win elec-
tions based on issues, not on name-call-
ing and not on teaching our young peo-
ple that we have a horrible, racist 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I guess for the benefit 
of all the people listening tonight, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday’s CPI report told Americans 
what they already knew all too well: 
The disastrous effects of Washington 
Democrats’ spending binge last year 
still have our economy in a vice grip. 
Year-on-year, inflation has hit 9.1 
percent for the first time since the fall-
out of the Carter administration. And 
the signs are inescapable. Price hikes 
on everything from food to fuel to 
housing are setting new multidecade 
highs. 
A shopper out in Oregon told a re-
porter recently she doesn’t buy beef 
anymore. Here is what she said: 
We kind of try to eat what we have while 
we have it. 
Yesterday, we learned exactly what 
she and millions of Americans are up 
against: the fastest rising grocery 
prices since 1979. 
In Nevada, the owner of a local diner 
says: 
My concerns are that my food costs have 
escalated dramatically. I used to gut wrench 
about [raising menu prices] 2 or 3 percent. 
Now it is way more than that just to keep 
my doors open. 
Yesterday’s report says he is not 
alone. Nationwide prices for food out-
side the home haven’t risen this fast 
since back in 1981. And this new reality 
is 
especially 
frustrating 
for 
those 
working to help. 
As the head of one South Dakota 
food bank put it, ‘‘The donation load 
seemed to lighten up. . . . When we 
give out food boxes, they’re not as full 
as they used to be.’’ 
Right as working families are strug-
gling the most, so are the organiza-
tions trying to help them. Just one 
more cruel twist of Washington Demo-
crats’ runaway inflation. 
One of the first and most painful con-
sequences of the Biden administra-
tion’s failed policies have been the 
soaring costs of energy. Remember, on 
their party’s watch, the cost of heating 
a home rose by double-digit percent-
ages last winter. Electricity prices 
climbed at their fastest rate since 2006. 
Prices at the gas pump have doubled 
since President Biden took office. One 
Pennsylvania woman said that ever 
since her heating bill skyrocketed last 
winter, she has had to scale back her 
spending big time. Here is what she had 
to say: 
I need to hide under my bed and save every 
dollar I can. 
And in Maryland, one retiree reports 
that ‘‘skyrocketing gas prices mean 
that visits to the local library—about 5 
miles round trip—no longer feel free.’’ 
From day one, the Biden administra-
tion has worked overtime to make it

harder to produce the most affordable 
and reliable forms of energy that 
Americans rely on at home. Now, as 
their radical climate agenda takes its 
toll on domestic production, millions 
of Americans are facing the possi-
bility—listen 
to 
this—of 
summer 
blackouts. 
The heartland, the West, and the 
Southwest face the highest risks. The 
people of Arizona and Nevada, for ex-
ample, are already at what experts call 
‘‘elevated risk’’ for this summer. 
Are Arizonans and Nevadans clam-
oring for a new tax hike on natural gas 
electricity on top of everything else? I 
doubt it. Are they desperate to double 
down on the very unreliable green 
sources that set us up for these black-
outs in the first place? I don’t think so. 
Our electric grid is overburdened al-
ready, but Democrats apparently want 
to strain it even more by eliminating 
the most reliable sources of energy we 
have, all the while spending hundreds 
of billions on schemes that depend on 
Chinese minerals, components, and 
supply chains. 
Trading American energy independ-
ence for less reliable sources that de-
pend on forced child labor and foreign 
producers with questionable environ-
mental standards—really, is this what 
our colleagues think will usher in a big 
transition to green daydreams? 
Washington Democrats are the only 
ones who would define higher energy 
costs and lower reliability as a victory. 
Real-life Americans know that higher 
costs and rolling blackouts are just 
two more symptoms of a failed govern-
ment with failed leadership pushing 
failed policies. 
Working families are still reeling 
from the time Democrats decided to 
spend us into inflation. They have got 
no appetite for being taxed into reces-
sion. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, all week long I have been dis-
cussing the historic Supreme Court 
term that wrapped up last month. Over 
the 
course 
of 
several 
months, 
a 
textualist 
and 
originalist 
majority 
issued the most consequential victories 
for our Constitution since the Court 
overturned Plessy v. Ferguson with 
Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. 
It was the best Supreme Court term 
in generations. 
The Court corrected one of the worst 
moral and legal mistakes of the 20th 
century and returned power to the 
American people to implement popular 
and commonsense protections for un-
born life and bring America back inside 
the global mainstream. 
The Court handed down two historic 
wins for religious liberty, rolling back 
decades of infringement on the rights 
of Americans to worship and to raise 
families as they choose. 
The Court strengthened the rights of 
law-abiding Americans to defend them-
selves outside the home in a resound-
ing 
reaffirmation 
of 
the 
Second 
Amendment. 
And the Court took a huge bite out of 
the 
unconstitutional 
administrative 
state and rolled back a big part of the 
Obama-Biden administration’s totally 
illegal Clean Power Plan. With elec-
tricity prices skyrocketing on Demo-
crats’ watch, experts warning about 
impending 
summer 
blackouts, 
and 
more pain at the gas pump, the last 
thing Americans need is a holy war on 
fossil fuels that Congress never actu-
ally authorized. 
The Court’s decision in West Virginia 
v. EPA was a victory for working 
Americans and a reminder that the 
power to make law rests with their 
elected Representatives, not unelected 
bureaucrats. 
But, today, I want to talk about 
something that runs even deeper than 
these historic rulings. As in any high- 
profile term, last month, the Court ar-
rived at rulings that some politicians 
and some citizens liked more than oth-
ers. Goodness knows that I have been 
disappointed in my share of Supreme 
Court rulings over the years, including 
some extremely consequential cases. 
Going back decades, there have been 
countless times when the Federal judi-
ciary has left conservative citizens 
feeling every bit as disappointed in a 
particular outcome as far-left activists 
seem to feel right now. After all, the 
courts don’t exist to enforce any one 
political ideology or policy agenda. 
The Justices’ sacred job is to follow the 
written text of our laws and Constitu-
tion wherever it may lead them and let 
the chips fall where they may. 
But there is something funny. I can’t 
recall any time when our side, the 
right-of-center side of America, en-
gaged in prolonged mob protests out-
side judges’ private family homes. The 
attacks on the judiciary, on this funda-
mental institution of our society, seem 
to only run in one direction. 
A few weeks ago, the Speaker of the 
House and the Senate Democratic lead-
er teamed up to issue a, frankly, un-
hinged statement. Most of the top 
Democrats in the country followed 
suit. Their reckless statements did not 
stop—indeed, 
barely 
even 
took 
a 
pause—when a disturbed leftwing per-
son very nearly tried to assassinate a 
sitting Justice. 
Frankly, the inflammatory tone of 
all of these attacks echoed the furious 
attacks on the Court, ironically, from 
the Democrats of the day after Brown 
overturned Plessy back in 1954. We are 
hearing absurd calls from the far left 
to have Congress politically persecute 
individual Justices because of their 
views of the law. They want to take off 
Lady Justice’s blindfold and scare the 
Court into becoming politically par-
tial. 
Well, this didn’t start now. Sadly, it 
has been years in the making. Along 
the path to this moment, the far left 
has stoked reckless rhetoric, and we 
have heard it from Democrats in elect-
ed office, like in the amicus brief from 
several Senators who declared the 
Court unwell—unwell—and warned it 
to ‘‘heal itself before the public de-
mands it be ‘restructured.’ ’’ In other 
words, do what we want you to do or 
we will change the makeup of the 
Court—or in the named threats from 
the Democratic leader himself that sit-
ting Justices would—listen to this— 
‘‘pay the price’’ for ruling in ways he 
didn’t like. He said that over in front 
of the Supreme Court. 
We have spent a year and a half now 
hearing Democrats say over and over 
and over again that a core principle of 
democracy is accepting the legitimacy 
of an outcome when you don’t like it. 
Sound familiar? Our colleagues need to 
practice what they preach. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
INFLATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
Republican leader comes to the floor 
regularly with heartfelt concerns about 
the burdens facing America’s families. 
I share those concerns. I think all Sen-
ators share those concerns. Inflation is 
a tough thing to deal with in the fam-
ily budget. I go home to Illinois to see 
the price of gasoline at the gas sta-
tions. I shop in my local stores and see 
what it costs for the basics. I under-
stand that, although it is an inconven-
ience for me, for many people, it is a 
hardship. So for the Republican leader 
to come to the floor and remind us of 
that problem which we are facing in 
our economy is certainly understand-
able. 
Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics released the Consumer Price 
Index for the month of June. It came in 
higher than anticipated. Prices rose by 
1.3 percent in June, and when compared 
to June 2021, prices are up 9.1 percent— 
the fastest year over year increase 
since 1981. When you dive into the data, 
you will see that prices jumped within 
categories that affect almost every 
household: food, energy, rent, gas. We 
know, for many American families, a 
break can’t come soon enough. 
So what are we going to do about it, 
give speeches? There are a lot of oppor-
tunities for us to do that, for the Re-
publican leader and the Democratic 
leader—or are we going to do some-
thing? 
The Democrats think it is time to do 
something, and we have picked one cat-
egory of cost that is particularly im-
portant to American families. It is the 
category of cost that not only is a life- 
and-death issue but that determines 
the cost of health insurance for fami-
lies. We know that because we are told 
by the largest health insurers in the 
United States that the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs is driving the cost of pre-
miums for health insurance, so Demo-
crats have decided to tackle this di-
rectly. 
Credit should go to our Democratic 
leader, Senator SCHUMER, who is in ne-
gotiation now on prescription drug 
pricing with Senator MANCHIN of West 
Virginia. I have been skeptical of the 
outcome of that negotiation, but I am 
beginning to be encouraged by what I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3287 
July 14, 2022 
hear from Senator SCHUMER and from 
Senator MANCHIN; that, in fact, we can 
give relief to American families on the 
life or death inflationary cost of pre-
scription drugs. 
Wouldn’t that be a breakthrough? 
Wouldn’t it be something if this 50–50 
Senate could end up doing something 
on a bipartisan basis that American 
families actually feel and for which 
seniors in our country would be able to 
say, ‘‘There is a limitation on how 
much I am going to be asked to spend 
for prescription drugs, and beyond 
that, I won’t have to pay’’? That is 
amazing—a breakthrough. Would it 
have made a difference when it comes 
to the cost of living for families? Of 
course it would. 
So you would think that the Senator 
from Kentucky, who comes to the floor 
every day to give a speech on inflation, 
would be the leading cheerleader in our 
effort to contain the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs. Wouldn’t you think so? No. 
No. He has announced that he would 
oppose the increased effort to lower the 
cost of prescription drugs because it 
might raise taxes on the wealthiest 
people in this country. Hard to imag-
ine, isn’t it? His sympathy for million-
aires and billionaires gets in the way of 
his caring for working families. 
I think he should set it aside and 
should ask his colleagues on the Re-
publican side of the aisle to join us in 
a bipartisan effort to contain the cost 
of prescription drugs. 
We recognize how these price in-
creases are squeezing household budg-
ets across America, and we take it seri-
ously. We have plans to lower prescrip-
tion drug prices, decrease the price of 
gas at the pump, help families with the 
cost of childcare, and increase the sup-
ply of housing, all of which will address 
inflation, but item No. 1, priority No. 1, 
is prescription drugs. 
The Senator from Kentucky has said 
he will oppose that. I hope he changes 
his mind. I hope, as he tells the stories 
of working families who tell him of the 
burdens they face with inflation, that 
he will also ask them the questions: 
How about reduction? How about pre-
scription drugs? Are those expensive 
for you? Does it create a hardship? You 
know they do. 
It is time for us to do something, and 
we would certainly like to have the Re-
publican leader on our team to deal 
with one of the serious problems of the 
cost of living in America today. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Madam President, on an unrelated 
topic, the majority leader comes to the 
floor and characterizes the Supreme 
Court as the best in history. He refers 
to decisions they have made and com-
pares them to Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation. 
For those who have forgotten, in 1954, 
the Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board 
of Education, basically said that sepa-
rate but equal does not work in Amer-
ica anymore; that we are going to pro-
vide real equality and real opportunity 
when it comes to education. It was a 
historic decision. 
The Senator from Kentucky com-
pares it to the Dobbs decision on a 
woman’s right to choose, but there is a 
critical difference. Brown v. Board of 
Education expanded the constitutional 
protections of Americans. It expanded 
the constitutional rights of Americans. 
Those are historic, and those are con-
sistent with the most celebrated deci-
sions in our Supreme Court’s history. 
Dobbs did just the opposite. For the 
first time ever in recorded history, the 
U.S. Supreme Court removed a con-
stitutional protection for its citizens. 
And what was that protection? The 
right of women to make their choices 
for their own reproductive health. 
So it is very painful to hear a com-
parison between Brown, which ex-
tended the constitutional protection 
and rights of individuals, and Dobbs, 
which, in overturning Roe v. Wade, 
went in exactly the opposite direction. 
It is interesting to me to hear the 
Court being described by the Senator 
from Kentucky as a Court that is 
originalist; that it just looked to the 
Constitution; that it just looked to his-
tory. Well, they also looked to some-
thing else. Every single nominee on the 
Supreme Court who had been installed 
under the Trump administration, with 
the facilitation of the Senator from 
Kentucky, had to check one important 
box: approved by the Federalist Soci-
ety. 
What is the Federalist Society? 
You can search the Constitution, and 
you will see no reference to it whatso-
ever, but it is very real. 
President Trump made no bones 
about it. He wouldn’t consider a Fed-
eral court judge, particularly for the 
Supreme Court, who had not been ap-
proved by the Federalist Society. The 
Federalist Society is an extreme right-
wing conservative group that approved 
judges during the Trump administra-
tion and the three judges who were ap-
proved for the Supreme Court. 
So the loyalty of these Justices may 
be to the Constitution, but it is also to 
the Federalist Society’s agenda, and 
that agenda applauds, of course, the 
Dobbs decision in overturning Roe v. 
Wade. 
Madam President, I want to make a 
point about attacks on Supreme Court 
Justices: unacceptable, unforgivable, 
and we should do something about it. 
Now, here is what the Senator from 
Kentucky failed to mention: The Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, which I 
chair, has enacted a law and has sent it 
to the floor, which would extend the 
protection of Federal judges in the 
Anderl Act so that there are more re-
sources put into their protection. It 
passed overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan 
basis, in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
You would think, with all of the 
speeches that we are hearing on the 
floor about the safety of judges and 
how we should take care that they are 
not in danger, that we would have 
passed that law on the floor of the Sen-
ate immediately, right? Wrong. That 
bill, which gives more resources to pro-
tect Federal judges, has been stopped 
by one Senator, and he has announced 
publicly that he has done it. 
Can you guess where that Senator is 
from? He is from the same State as the 
minority leader—Kentucky. 
Senator RAND PAUL has held up this 
bill for additional resources to protect 
Federal judges for weeks on end. Why? 
Why don’t we want to protect them? He 
objects to the way we have done it, and 
he has held up the bill. He won’t even 
let us vote on it. 
So I would say to the minority leader 
from Kentucky: If you really care 
about the security of judges in the Fed-
eral system, pick up the phone and call 
your colleague from the State of Ken-
tucky and ask him to withdraw his 
hold on this bill. 
We should pass that bill this week. If 
something terrible happens to a Fed-
eral judge, God forbid, how in the world 
can we explain that one Senator from 
Kentucky has held up the bill that 
might have created the resources to 
protect that Federal judge? That is the 
reality. 
So when you talk about judicial safe-
ty, start at home. Start with the State 
of Kentucky—one Senator for it; the 
other Senator blocking it. If both of 
them would be for it, we would do it 
this afternoon. 
FREEDOM TO TRAVEL FOR HEALTH CARE ACT OF 
2022 
Madam President, I would also like 
to address one of the aspects of the 
Dobbs decision in overturning Roe v. 
Wade which will be addressed by our 
colleagues a little later this morning. 
Our Nation is in the midst of a 
healthcare crisis because of this Dobbs 
decision. In the weeks since the Su-
preme Court overturned Roe v. Wade— 
erasing a longstanding constitutional 
right to abortion—pregnant women 
across America have been thrust into 
chaos. From the moment this decision 
came down, abortion was declared ille-
gal in nearly 12 States. Some of these 
States’ abortion bans make no excep-
tion even in cases of rape and incest. 
Even when exceptions are made to save 
the life of a mother, they are confusing 
and leave medical professionals uncer-
tain of their legal status. 
The sad reality is that these laws 
will most certainly result in there 
being pregnant women in danger, espe-
cially women of color who are more 
likely to experience severe and even 
deadly complications as a result of 
pregnancy. 
Earlier this week, the Senate Judici-
ary Committee held a hearing to exam-
ine the damage that has been created 
by overturning Roe. 
During that hearing, we heard testi-
mony from Dr. Colleen McNicholas. 
She is an OB–GYN doctor and abortion 
provider who practices in both my 
home State of Illinois and the neigh-
boring State of Missouri. 
Dr. McNicholas told the committee: 
When the Supreme Court overturned Roe 
v. Wade, they effectively created two na-
tions: one where those reproductive freedoms 
belong to themselves, and those whose repro-
ductive freedom belongs to a small group of

politicians who effectively appointed them-
selves as the decision-makers over the bod-
ies, lives, and futures [of women]. 
Dr. McNicholas informed us that the 
demand for care at her facility in Illi-
nois has tripled since the Roe v. Wade 
decision was overturned by the Su-
preme Court. She said: 
The Supreme Court’s decision has already 
pushed people—the people each one of you 
represent—into extreme, and sometimes dan-
gerous, circumstances in order to access one 
of the safest and most common healthcare 
procedures. 
The radical, far-right majority on the 
Alito Supreme Court has put lives at 
risk by revoking a constitutional right, 
which was on the books for almost 50 
years. Now, Members of this Senate 
must act to protect another constitu-
tional right related to this debate: the 
right to travel across State lines to ac-
cess healthcare, in this case, reproduc-
tive care. 
That is why I am joining my col-
leagues Senators CORTEZ MASTO, PATTY 
MURRAY, SHELDON
WHITEHOUSE, and 
KIRSTEN
GILLIBRAND
in cosponsoring 
the Freedom To Travel Healthcare Act 
of 2022. 
Women and their health providers 
are counting on us to pass this bill. 
They find it hard to imagine that State 
legislators, and even some Federal offi-
cials, would try to restrict the right to 
cross a State boundary for medical 
care because the anti-choice legislators 
who have already outlawed abortion in 
their State are not content with what 
they have done already. In fact, right 
now, they are proposing legislation 
that would turn many State borders 
into Checkpoint Charlie in America. 
These lawmakers are hell-bent on de-
nying women fundamental freedoms, 
no matter how many constitutional 
rights they infringe upon. 
The question is, How far are we will-
ing to let them go? Will we allow them 
to penalize and prosecute healthcare 
professionals who provide essential 
care to their patients in States where 
abortion remains legal? Are we going 
to allow these lawmakers to hold 
American citizens hostage in their own 
States, forcing them to give birth? 
Does that sound like the America that 
we know? No, it doesn’t. And we need 
to draw the line here and now by pass-
ing 
the 
Freedom 
To 
Travel 
for 
Healthcare Act of 2022. 
2022 NATO SUMMIT 
Madam President, during the first 
part of the July recess, I traveled with 
several of my Senate colleagues to the 
historic NATO summit in Madrid, 
Spain. 
On Tuesday, several members of our 
bipartisan group—Senators SHAHEEN, 
TILLIS, COONS, ERNST, and BLUNT— 
spoke on the floor about the trip. Sen-
ator FISCHER was also with us at that 
summit meeting. 
I think Senator TILLIS of North Caro-
lina said it best, that despite policy dif-
ferences within our group of Senators, 
there was no daylight between us on 
two profoundly important matters: We 
agree, Finland and Sweden should be 
welcomed into NATO. And we also 
agree that the illegal, barbaric war on 
Ukraine by Russian dictator Vladimir 
Putin must not succeed. 
At the summit, we met with leaders 
from a number of our allies, including, 
for the first time, leaders from the 
Indo-Pacific region who joined the 
NATO summit. 
Japanese Prime Minister Kishida was 
clear when he told us: 
The security of Europe and the Indo-Pa-
cific are inseparable. 
And German Chancellor Scholz ex-
pressed an unwavering commitment to 
take as long as needed to make sure 
Ukraine retains its sovereignty against 
Russia’s barbaric aggression. 
But perhaps what was most notable 
was the overwhelming sense of unity 
and defense of common values found 
among our NATO allies in the face of 
Russian aggression. For that, I want to 
give President Biden credit. He spent 
an hour or more with our bipartisan 
delegation at the summit meeting. He 
and his able team, Secretary of State 
Blinken, Secretary of Defense Austin, 
and others, met with us and discussed 
in detail what was being debated at the 
summit. 
I have been traveling to Eastern Eu-
rope and meeting with allies for many 
years. I can tell you, I have never felt 
such a shared sense of purpose and de-
termination 
to 
stop 
the 
Russian 
threat. 
As Senator TILLIS noted on Tuesday, 
our safety at home is inextricably 
linked to the security of Europe. Our 
bipartisan delegation understood this. 
The world leaders at the NATO summit 
understood it, and President Biden cer-
tainly understands it. Vladimir Putin 
would serve his people well by under-
standing it as well. 
In the Senate, we can help Putin un-
derstand the unbreakable unity and re-
solve of the world’s democracies by 
being one of the first NATO members 
of nations to approve Finland and Swe-
den’s membership. We should do that 
without delay. 
SWEDEN 
Madam President, before arriving at 
the NATO summit in Spain, I joined 
my colleagues in visiting one of the 
prospective new NATO aspirants: Swe-
den. 
Sweden has long been a security ally. 
For nearly 200 years, it has tried to 
maintain the semblance of nonalign-
ment. That changed swiftly with Vladi-
mir Putin’s aggression. It triggered an 
overwhelming Swedish support to join 
NATO, and Sweden began shipping 
weapons to Ukraine to help in the war 
effort, something it hadn’t done since 
helping Finland resist Nazi aggression 
in 1939. 
Swedish leaders recognize Russia’s 
aggression today as the same kind of 
behavior seen in Europe in World War 
II. They know that the collective 
NATO security arrangement is critical 
to stopping Russia. I agree completely 
and look forward to their NATO mem-
bership. 
Putin thought he could fracture 
NATO by invading Ukraine. Look what 
he did. He stoked petty grievances 
against NATO, and in the end, we are 
picking up two valuable, important al-
lies. 
And, incidentally, Vladimir Putin, 
you are now going to have 800 miles of 
new NATO territory on your border. 
LITHUANIA AND BELARUS 
Madam President, I was unable to 
join my colleagues who visited Finland 
as their first stop, as I was in Lith-
uania, a Baltic State with long memo-
ries of Russian tyranny. 
In no place is the value of the collec-
tive NATO defense more stark than in 
the Baltic States, which Putin, no 
doubt, would like to forcibly return to 
Soviet dystopia. 
Lithuanian leaders, including Presi-
dent Nauseda, the Speaker of Par-
liament Cmilyte-Nielsen, are keenly 
aware of the Russian threat. But Lith-
uania is undeterred in helping its 
neighbors in Ukraine and Belarus stand 
up to Russian aggression, and they are 
unafraid to stand up to the Chinese 
bullies as well. 
I was glad again to spend time with 
Valdas Adamkus, a highly successful 
Lithuanian immigrant to Chicago who 
returned back to his homeland of Lith-
uania and successfully ran for Presi-
dent. He was there shortly after Lith-
uania gained its independence from the 
Soviet Union. 
President Adamkus’ historic leader-
ship and foresight helped bring Lith-
uania not only into the European 
Union, but equally important, into 
NATO. And for that, the Lithuanian 
Parliament 
recently 
honored 
his 
achievements. Quite simply, Lithuania 
is safer today because of his vision. 
The awe and esteem Lithuanians feel 
for this historic leader was clear from 
the reverence shown by the Lithuanian 
people. 
I also want to mention the tireless 
work of Belarusian opposition leader 
Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, who lives in 
Lithuania after fleeing from Belarus 
from the henchmen of the strongman 
leader Alexander Lukashenko. You see, 
2 years ago, her husband, Sergei, ran 
for President against Lukashenko. We 
know from history that anybody who 
was courageous enough to run against 
Lukashenko is going to end up in pris-
on after the sham elections which he 
stages with regularity. 
Lukashenko, 
worried 
that 
he 
couldn’t win a fair election, jailed 
Sergei, her husband. Rather than back 
down in fear, Svetlana, the wife, ran in 
his place. She probably won the rigged 
election but had to flee with her fam-
ily, leaving Sergei to face an out-
rageous 18-year prison sentence. 
This 
is 
a 
picture 
of 
Sergei 
Tsikhanouskya facing an 18-year sen-
tence in Belarusian prison because he 
had 
the 
temerity 
to 
challenge 
Lukashenko. Now his wife, a coura-
geous woman if I ever met one, is try-
ing to plead his cause and is safely 
with her children in Lithuania.

July 14, 2022 
Thousands 
upon 
thousands 
of 
Belarusians protested the stolen elec-
tion. Twelve hundred were jailed as a 
result of it, including Sergei. Putin 
helped Lukashenko at that moment of 
crisis, and Lukashenko is now repaying 
Putin by using Belarus as a staging 
ground to attack and kill Ukrainians. 
Many brave Belarusians still resist, 
sabotaging Russian supply lines, fight-
ing alongside their Ukrainian brothers 
and sisters. They understand the fate 
of Ukraine is tied to their own fate and 
that Putin must not prevail. 
Yesterday, I introduced a resolution 
with Senators TILLIS, SHAHEEN, VAN 
HOLLEN, MARKEY, FISCHER, CARDIN, and 
RUBIO recognizing the second adversary 
of this stolen election, the historic 
peaceful protest, the continued heroic 
efforts of the Belarusian people, and 
those still languishing in their nation’s 
jails. They and their fight for freedom 
and democracy cannot be forgotten. 
And I urge the administration to con-
tinue its support for their effort by ap-
pointing a new special envoy for 
Belarus without delay. 
Let me conclude with a note of 
thanks to the many fine members of 
our State Department Foreign Service 
who worked tirelessly to represent our 
diplomatic interests overseas and also 
make these congressional visits pos-
sible. They, along with our military 
servicemembers serving around the 
world, are national treasures. I thank 
them for their service. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, yes-
terday morning, June inflation num-
bers were released. And, as usual with 
this administration, the news was not 
good. 
Inflation rose once again in June to 
9.1 percent—the highest inflation since 
November of 1981. November of 1981. I 
was in college the last time inflation 
was this bad. 
Americans are suffering. Everywhere 
Americans turn, they are being asked 
to pay more—more for cleaning sup-
plies, more for gas, more for health in-
surance, more for groceries. 
A new analysis yesterday from the 
Joint Economic Committee found that 
inflation will cost the average Amer-
ican household a staggering $718 a 
month over the next year—$718 per 
month. That will happen even if prices 
stop 
going 
up 
tomorrow—$718 
per 
month, more than $8,600 for the year. 
No working family can afford that. 
A major reason that we are in this 
crisis is because of Democrats’ decision 
to flood the economy with unnecessary 
government money with their so-called 
American Rescue Plan Act. And, unfor-
tunately, there is no easy solution to 
the crisis they helped create. But the 
first thing—the first thing—should be 
to do no more harm. 
Incredibly, however, Democrats are 
currently attempting to double down 
on the strategy that helped create this 
crisis in the first place by passing a 
version of the Build Back Better tax- 
and-spending spree they tried to force 
through last year. 
Apparently, Democrats think more 
government spending—like the govern-
ment spending that helped get us into 
this mess—plus new taxes are a good 
solution for an inflation crisis and an 
economy teetering on the brink of re-
cession. 
Madam President, if Democrats want 
to help our country get out of this in-
flation crisis, more unnecessary gov-
ernment spending and new taxes are 
the exact wrong way to go about it. In 
fact, the biggest thing the Democrats 
can do to avoid making this crisis 
worse is by flooding the economy with 
more unnecessary government money. 
After that, the biggest thing Demo-
crats and the administration in par-
ticular can do to help alleviate this cri-
sis is to unleash American energy pro-
duction. I don’t need to tell anyone 
that energy prices have been a major 
contributor to our inflation crisis. Gas 
prices are up nearly 60 percent—60 per-
cent. The current cost of a gallon of 
regular gas is $4.60—almost double 
what it was when President Biden took 
office just 18 months ago—and the 
price of diesel is even worse, which is a 
big concern for farmers and ranchers 
back home in South Dakota and 
around the country, not to mention all 
of our truckers. Electricity—that is up 
13 percent. Utility gas service is up 38 
percent. Americans everywhere are 
feeling the pinch. 
Of course, high gas prices and utility 
prices don’t just cause direct pain at 
the pump; they also contribute to high-
er prices across the economy, which 
means that lowering energy prices is 
one of the most important things we 
can do to help ease high prices on a va-
riety of goods. The way to lower energy 
prices is to unleash American energy 
production, including and especially 
conventional energy production. Unfor-
tunately, the President has shown and 
continues to show a clear hostility to 
conventional energy production despite 
the fact that our economy cannot func-
tion without conventional energy. 
Now, I am a longtime supporter of al-
ternative 
energy, 
from 
wind 
to 
biofuels, and I come from a State that 
derives a substantial portion of its 
electricity generation from wind. In 
fact, in 2021, over 50 percent of our 
State’s power generation came from 
wind and 30 percent came from hydro-
electric power on the Missouri River. 
But if it weren’t for traditional fossil 
fuels backing up that generation, we 
would be left in the dark. 
The fact is, no matter how much 
Democrats might wish it were other-
wise, alternative energy technology 
has simply not advanced to the point 
where our country can rely exclusively 
on alternative energy. That means 
that, unless we want Americans to be 
permanently buried under the pain of 
high gas prices, we need to invest in re-
sponsible production of oil and natural 
gas. 
We have tremendous natural re-
sources here at home, and the ability 
to extract those resources is a far more 
environmentally responsible way than 
frequently happens in other countries. 
But unleashing American production is 
going to require action from the Presi-
dent, who, despite the current energy 
price crisis, continues to display hos-
tility to domestic production. He touts 
the number of leases oil and gas com-
panies have available, but he fails to 
mention that just 3 months ago his ad-
ministration made it harder for oil and 
gas companies to actually make use of 
the leases in question by increasing the 
regulatory burden for environmental 
reviews. On top of this, thousands of 
drilling permits, which are required to 
actually begin drilling on oil and gas 
leases, are currently stuck in the ap-
proval process at the Department of 
the Interior. 
At the beginning of this month, the 
administration released a new offshore 
drilling plan which includes an option 
to offer, at most, a paltry 11 new leases 
over the next 5 years. It also leaves the 
door open for zero new leases—zero. If 
this proposed 5-year plan doesn’t make 
it clear that the President isn’t inter-
ested in increasing our domestic en-
ergy production, I don’t know what 
does. 
Madam President, I could go on. I 
could mention the administration’s 
proposed SEC climate-disclosure rules 
that are designed to discourage invest-
ment in conventional energy or the 
President’s quest to increase taxes on 
domestic oil and gas production or 
Democrats’ efforts to impose a new 
fee—or tax—on methane that could 
cost consumers an additional $35 bil-
lion to $69 billion annually, but I will 
leave it there. 
Madam President, I hope—I really 
hope—that the President and his ad-
ministration will take a good, hard 
look at their hostility to conventional 
energy production. Inflation is at 9.1 
percent—9.1 percent. American fami-
lies are paying nearly twice what they 
were paying in gas prices just 18 
months ago, and utility gas prices have 
increased sharply. 
Unless Democrats want Americans to 
be facing staggering prices at the pump 
and on store shelves for the long term, 
the administration needs to start en-
couraging domestic production of con-
ventional energy. That means not just 
approving leases but making it easier 
for oil and gas companies to actually 
develop those leases and produce oil 
and natural gas. It means encouraging, 
not discouraging, investment in re-
sponsible conventional production and 
infrastructure like natural gas pipe-
lines. It means giving up attempts to 
discourage domestic energy production 
with new and higher taxes or burden-
some ESG regulations. 
American families are struggling, 
Madam President. The President can 
actually do something to help them, 
and I sincerely hope that he will. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3290 
July 14, 2022 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Minnesota. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4504 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I rise today in support of the Freedom 
to Travel for Health Care Act—some-
thing that Senator CORTEZ MASTO, our 
colleague from Nevada, is leading. 
I do want to take a moment, how-
ever, to note that there are many 
things we need to do to reduce costs. I 
appreciated the words of my colleague 
from the neighboring State of South 
Dakota, and I think he is well aware 
that pharmaceutical prices are No. 1 on 
the minds of people in many of our 
States. I ask Republicans to join us in 
pushing Medicare to finally negotiate 
lifting the ban so we can negotiate less 
expensive drugs under Medicare Part 
D—something that every Democrat is 
committed to in our caucus and we 
hope to get done in the next month. 
I also note that the President re-
cently came out for E15—something 
Senator THUNE and I have worked to-
gether on for years, and that is now in 
place as one competitive fuel that 
should help—not alleviate everything 
but be a major help—and the release of 
the oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve and so many other areas where 
we are working together. 
I don’t think anyone thought we 
could emerge from a 2-year pandemic 
and everything was going to be the 
same. Obviously, there is work left to-
gether for the country to bring down 
costs, and that is on all of our minds. 
Madam President, also on our minds 
is what has recently happened with the 
Supreme Court and the decision in the 
Dobbs case. Twenty days ago—only 20 
days ago, and you can see everything 
that has happened since that time—the 
Supreme Court issued a ruling shred-
ding nearly five decades of precedent 
protecting a woman’s right to make 
her own healthcare decisions. Now 
women are at the mercy of a patch-
work of State laws governing their 
ability to access reproductive care, 
leaving them with fewer rights than 
their moms and their grandmas. 
In just 20 days, over 20 States have 
laws in place that could be used to re-
strict access to abortion. Twenty-five 
States in total are expected to ban 
abortion in the days and the weeks 
ahead. But, colleagues, I am afraid the 
worst is yet to come. 
Legislation was introduced in Mis-
souri to allow private citizens to act as 
vigilantes and sue people who help 
women cross State lines for reproduc-
tive care—vigilantes, just like we saw 
in Texas. In Texas, legislators are 
working on a bill to criminalize busi-
nesses that provide resources simply to 
help their workers obtain abortion 
services in other States. 
These proposals don’t just hurt those 
in need of care; they are also creating 
an uncertain environment for doctors 
and straining resources at clinics in 
States like Minnesota where reproduc-
tive rights are protected, two major 
States in the Midwest—that is it—Illi-
nois and Minnesota. 
I spoke on the phone with the head of 
the Red River Women’s Clinic out of 
Fargo, ND, who had to resort to a 
GoFundMe page to get the money she 
needs to move her clinic across the 
river to Minnesota to a safe place. 
Planned Parenthood in Moorhead, 
MN—I met with them only a week ago 
about the services and the work they 
are doing right now. 
In Montana, clinics have already 
begun requiring proof of residency from 
women seeking abortion pills because 
they are afraid they might be pursued 
by out-of-State prosecutors. 
Of course, we should never settle for 
a situation where women in Minnesota 
have different rights than women in 
Missouri or where women in Illinois 
have different rights than women in 
Texas, but with so many extreme Re-
publicans racing to State capitals to be 
the first to take away women’s rights, 
it is clear we must explicitly protect 
the right to travel to other States to 
access reproductive care. We don’t have 
to imagine why this might matter. We 
don’t need to conjure up hypotheticals. 
We already know what has happened. 
Think about the heartbreaking, en-
raging story about the 10-year-old girl 
in Ohio who had to go to Indiana to get 
an abortion after she was impregnated 
by her rapist. When that story came 
out last week, some people doubted it. 
Now, in clear print in the criminal 
complaint out of the State of Ohio, we 
saw yesterday that, yes, this happened. 
This man raped a 10-year-old girl, and 
she got pregnant, and then she couldn’t 
even get the care she needed—at age 
10—to get an abortion. She had to go 
across State lines to the State of Indi-
ana just to get her care. 
Should the next little 10-year-old’s 
right or 12-year-old’s right or 14-year- 
old’s right to get the care that she des-
perately needs be put in jeopardy? 
What about her mom? What about her 
doctor? Where will this end? 
That is why we must not just codify 
Roe v. Wade into law with the bill that 
we voted on just last month, but we 
must also pass the Freedom to Travel 
for Health Care Act by unanimous con-
sent right now. That is a bill that our 
great colleague Senator CORTEZ MASTO 
is leading. 
Our bill protects women and girls 
from being punished for traveling to 
another State to access abortion serv-
ices. It also ensures doctors won’t be 
punished for providing reproductive 
care outside their home States. As 
clinics across the country struggle to 
navigate this post-Roe nightmare land-
scape, they should not have to add to 
their list of worries whether they will 
be criminally prosecuted for serving 
patients in a nearby State. This is an 
issue, as I noted, that hits close to 
home because of Minnesota being in 
the neighborhood that includes the 
States of North Dakota, South Dakota, 
Iowa, and Wisconsin, all of which have 
various 
issues 
with 
reproductive 
healthcare. 
The freedom to travel cannot be an 
empty promise. That is why the bill 
gives the Department of Justice, as 
well as women and doctors, the power 
to sue people who infringe on the right 
to travel for healthcare. Women in 
States with abortion bans already face 
enough obstacles to care. We can’t wait 
to see what anti-choice State legisla-
tors criminalize next. We have to act 
now. 
All of this comes down to one ques-
tion: Who should get to make the per-
sonal decisions for a woman or for a 10- 
year-old girl? Should it be her family? 
Should it be a woman herself? Or 
should it be politicians, our colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle who sup-
ported these Justices, put them in 
place in the Supreme Court, and got us 
to where we are right now? I think the 
answer is clear. 
Today, each and every one of my col-
leagues has the opportunity to show 
where they stand. Will we come to-
gether to protect this essential right to 
seek healthcare across State lines for 
the sake of the women and, yes, the 
young girls across this country? I hope 
we do. 
I thank Senator CORTEZ MASTO for 
her leadership. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
thank the senior Senator from Min-
nesota for her remarks and for what 
brings us to the floor today. 
This is the first time in American 
history that a fundamental constitu-
tional right has been stripped away 
from the American people—and espe-
cially American women—by the Su-
preme Court of the United States. 
In Dobbs, the U.S. Supreme Court de-
molished 50 years of precedent—half a 
century of Democratic- and Repub-
lican-appointed Justices upholding a 
constitutional right to privacy that 
has now been obliterated by the U.S. 
Supreme Court, a fundamental right 
that has been upheld over and over 
again by Justices appointed, as I said, 
by Presidents of both sides of the aisle. 
Madam President, if you had said to 
me when I was in law school in the 
early nineties that this day would ever 
come, that the U.S. Supreme Court, 
using a radical—a radical—method of 
constitutional 
interpretation 
called 
originalism that was invented basically 
when I was in law school—if you had 
told me that there would be a Presi-
dent of the United States who would 
appoint a majority of the Supreme 
Court with that radical interpretation, 
I would never have believed it. I would 
never have believed it. And that is 
what happened because of the Justices 
Donald Trump put on the Supreme 
Court. 
I want people to hear me who are Re-
publicans in this country and this 
Chamber. Look it up. I know it is 
called originalism, but it started in the 
1980s and started in the 1990s. It is not 
the way our Constitution has been in-
terpreted all these years. 
This is radical. It is not conservative. 
In no sense is this a conservative deci-
sion. And it has happened, and now

S3291 
July 14, 2022 
Americans no longer have a constitu-
tional right to privacy to make their 
own health and reproductive choices. 
I can tell you, I read every one of 
these opinions. In Justice Alito’s opin-
ion for the majority, he never even had 
the courage to grapple with the nature 
of this fundamental right, what strip-
ping it away would mean for millions 
of Americans and especially millions of 
American women, like my three daugh-
ters. Instead, what he said was—what 
he wrote was: If it wasn’t a right in 
1868, it is not a right today. That was 
the depth of his analysis—an opinion 
dripping with hostility and a cavalier 
attitude toward what he was stripping 
away from the American people. 
I know. I live in a State where there 
are people who hold very sincere beliefs 
on both sides of this question. This is a 
question that is hard for many Ameri-
cans. That is why I have always be-
lieved the right place for this decision 
to be made is by a woman with her doc-
tor, not by the State, not by a State 
saying that you have to carry your 
pregnancy to term without any regard 
for the individual circumstances that 
you might face. Instead, as a result of 
this Court’s decision, State laws to ban 
abortion that are literally from the 
1800s are coming back into being. Poli-
ticians are writing new State laws to 
force a woman to carry a pregnancy to 
term, as I said, without exception. 
Think about that. Even for women and 
children who have been raped, like that 
10-year-old girl in Ohio who had to 
travel to Indiana for an abortion—she 
is living in a State where they are 
talking about passing a personhood 
bill. 
Soldiers serving—and I have heard in 
my own State from women who have 
served in the Armed Forces who are 
worried about women who are serving 
in the Armed Forces today on U.S. 
military bases in States like Mis-
sissippi that have banned abortion. 
What is supposed to happen to them? 
What has happened to their right to 
privacy? Even if we paid for them to 
travel, everybody is going to know 
what is going on. 
Pregnant women could easily find 
themselves in America today in an 
emergency room with life-threatening 
complications—it 
happens 
literally 
every single day, every day—with doc-
tors unable to help because somebody 
has to go and consult a lawyer. Doctors 
are afraid to prescribe medications for 
their patients or even have a conversa-
tion about their reproductive health 
for fear of prosecution. 
All over the country, there are elect-
ed 
leaders—so-called 
leaders—politi-
cians who are putting themselves be-
tween a woman and her right to 
choose. 
Nothing I am saying here is fan-
tastic. Everything I am saying here is 
being talked about, contemplated, leg-
islated in America today all across this 
country as a result of what the Su-
preme Court has done. 
A woman with cancer could learn she 
is pregnant—it happens every day, 
every day—and learn she can’t get the 
treatment she needs for her cancer. 
This is literally crazy—it is literally 
crazy—but, as you have heard on the 
floor today, this isn’t even crazy 
enough for some of these elected politi-
cians around the country. Now they are 
threatening to use the law to prevent 
women, American citizens, from exer-
cising their right to travel across State 
lines to access reproductive healthcare 
in the United States of America. It 
wasn’t enough to strip women of this 
fundamental right and have the State 
force them to bring a pregnancy to 
term. That is not enough. Now they 
want to use the law to prevent her 
from traveling from one State to an-
other in the United States of America. 
I see the pages sitting here today 
who are the age of my daughter—one of 
them—who is 17 years old. I can’t be-
lieve this is what we are handing over 
to the next generation of Americans. I 
can’t believe it. I cannot believe it. 
This is despicable, especially coming 
from the same people who can never 
stop telling us how devoted they are to 
freedom and liberty. What a lie that is. 
What a lie that is. 
I am coming to the end. I know that 
my colleague from Oregon is next. But 
I just want to say one last thing. I am 
so grateful to live in a State like Colo-
rado, a western purple State, where we 
have already codified a woman’s right 
to an abortion, a woman’s right to 
choose. We understand and we have al-
ways as a State understood that pro-
tecting a woman’s personal liberty to 
make these decisions is fundamental to 
her freedom to participate in our soci-
ety. 
If people from other States need to 
come to Colorado to access the care 
they need, Congress has the obligation 
to shield them from prosecution. We 
need to make sure that healthcare pro-
viders, no matter where they are—Col-
orado and other States—are safe from 
prosecution, to say nothing of the 
women themselves, to say nothing of 
teenage girls themselves. 
I can’t believe we are even having 
this conversation on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. I can’t believe it. But that 
is the America we live in now because 
of this Supreme Court, because of this 
radical ideology they have perpetrated. 
That is why I strongly, strongly sup-
port this bill from my colleague from 
Nevada, CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO. On 
behalf of my three daughters, I want to 
thank her for her invaluable leadership 
on this issue. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator the Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many 
colleagues want to speak, and I am 
going to be brief. 
The name of Senator CORTEZ MASTO’s 
bill sums up what this is really all 
about. The Senator has proposed—and 
she is a former attorney general, a very 
skilled lawyer—she has proposed legis-
lation, the Freedom to Travel for 
Health Care Act. I just want us to take 
a second to think about the name of 
my colleague from Nevada’s legisla-
tion. 
I would submit to the Senate that 
you know something has gone horribly 
wrong in America when the Senate is 
forced to consider a proposal entitled 
the ‘‘Freedom to Travel for Health 
Care Act.’’ Colleagues, just look at 
those words, the ‘‘freedom to travel for 
health care.’’ My colleague has intro-
duced a bill that is as basic as it gets— 
freedom. 
The fact is, six Republicans on the 
Supreme Court have ripped that free-
dom out by the roots. Now State gov-
ernments are moving toward criminal-
izing travel for healthcare. They are 
even moving towards criminalizing 
helping—helping—people 
travel 
for 
healthcare. That is unthinkable, in my 
view, except millions and millions of 
Americans are, in fact, thinking about 
it and being terrified every single day. 
In my home State of Oregon, we are 
fortunate to live in a State that pro-
tects women’s health and women’s 
basic freedoms. My home State is going 
to be there for people to get the 
healthcare they need, including an 
abortion. 
But the fight cannot be left up to the 
States. That is why I am so pleased to 
stand with my colleague from Nevada, 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO, and my part-
ner from the Pacific Northwest, Sen-
ator MURRAY, to call for the Senate to 
pass legislation with the name the 
‘‘Freedom to Travel for Health Care 
Act.’’ What my colleague’s legislation 
does is protect women and doctors, and 
she does it by protecting a constitu-
tional right—the constitutional right 
to interstate travel. 
Colleagues, even 3 weeks after the 
ruling that overturned Roe, it is shock-
ing and appalling to see what has come 
next. We see States sprinting towards 
banning and criminalizing abortion 
outright. Are you a victim of rape or 
incest? No exceptions. Are you a child? 
You will still be forced to birth a child. 
Is your life in danger if you carry a 
pregnancy to term? You better get 
your affairs in order. That is the world 
millions and millions of American 
women are living in now that the Re-
publicans on the Supreme Court have 
ripped away Roe v. Wade. More wom-
en’s lives are in danger. More American 
freedoms are disappearing. 
The legislation proposed by my col-
league from Nevada is as basic as it 
gets. The Senate needs to act now, and 
it needs to act without any further 
delay. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Mr. President, 
the Senate should absolutely support 
the Freedom to Travel for Health Care 
Act. 
Currently, abortion is banned in 10 
States, with many more set to follow— 
now, not in Colorado, where we acted 
strongly to support access to reproduc-
tive care. Like other pro-choice States,

July 14, 2022 
we are seeing a large influx of patients. 
Yet we have heard tragic stories of 
women sleeping in their cars overnight 
outside of clinics, after traveling hun-
dreds of miles, as they wait for ap-
pointments. 
After the Texas abortion ban took ef-
fect, one woman had her water break 
at 19 weeks—actually, on her wedding 
day. She had moved up her wedding 
day. The doctors recommended termi-
nating her pregnancy to protect her 
life, increase the possibility, the likeli-
hood, she could have children in the fu-
ture. But it wasn’t allowed in Texas, so 
she flew to Colorado for emergency 
care. Her doctor had her make a plan 
for this travel, make a plan in case she 
went into labor on the flight. The plan 
was to sit near the bathroom. 
That is what it will soon come to for 
women in half of America. Without 
this legislation, a woman could face 
prosecution for traveling across State 
lines. Let that sink in: Her choice 
would be possible jail or probable 
death. 
This bill will protect every woman’s 
right to travel to seek reproductive 
care—basic freedom. It would also pro-
tect doctors who would practice in 
States like Colorado and protect them 
from prosecution and lawsuits for help-
ing out-of-State patients. 
Fundamentally, as my fellow Sen-
ators have said, this is about freedom. 
In this new post-Roe era, women can be 
forced 
into 
government-mandated 
pregnancies. 
States 
are 
stripping 
women of the freedom over their bodies 
and their future. The least we should 
do is protect every patient traveling to 
receive care that just a few weeks ago 
was permitted nationwide. 
Threatening millions of women and 
doctors with jail time for seeking or 
providing 
reproductive 
healthcare 
would be a stain on this Nation. I hope 
we can find 60 Senators to support this 
bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am very glad to stand with Senator 
CORTEZ MASTO to support this legisla-
tion and also recognize the leadership 
of Senator MURRAY on this issue as we 
fight to protect fundamental rights be-
longing to the women of America. 
For nearly half a century, women re-
lied on Roe’s recognition that the Con-
stitution protects their right to decide 
if and when to have children. A radical 
and captured Supreme Court has re-
voked this constitutional right, dis-
rupting the reliance and trust of gen-
erations of women to make funda-
mental 
decisions 
about 
their 
own 
health and their own futures. 
Overturning Roe is wildly unpopular, 
which is why extremists went to the 
captured Court to get a change that 
they could not get through the demo-
cratic process. Deep-pocketed extrem-
ist interests invested hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars over decades to build a 
Court where that kind of stuff could 
get done. 
It is an outrage. Women across this 
country are angry. Democrats in Con-
gress are angry, and we are fighting 
back in every way we can. 
In addition to State abortion bans, 
emboldened legislatures are readying 
even more extreme restrictions on 
women, like proposals to investigate, 
prosecute, and sue women who travel 
out of State to get the care they need. 
You think I am kidding? Legislation to 
this effect has already been introduced 
in Missouri. The Constitution already 
protects the right to interstate travel, 
but as we have now seen, we can’t rely 
on an increasingly extremist Supreme 
Court to protect our rights. 
Remember, in a large number of 
pregnancies, abortion actually becomes 
medically necessary—medically nec-
essary—for the health of the woman to 
bear children in the future, for the life 
of the woman to survive, the risk the 
pregnancy presents, for the risk to 
have other children. 
So it is extremely important to make 
sure women can get that medical care. 
It is extremely important to protect 
their right to make this choice them-
selves. And it is extremely important 
to protect medical professionals in 
States like Rhode Island, my home 
State, from punishment for providing 
care to women from States where State 
legislatures have made abortions ille-
gal. 
I was proud to work with Senator 
CORTEZ MASTO from the outset to help 
draft 
the 
Freedom 
to 
Travel 
for 
Healthcare Act. It will protect wom-
en’s rights to cross State lines and 
seek medical services and protect pro-
viders in States that they are traveling 
to. I join my colleagues to urge swift 
passage of this bill. This is just one 
step. There is much more work to be 
done to stand against this continuing 
assault 
on 
women’s 
constitutional 
rights. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. 
CANTWELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
while other colleagues are joining us to 
speak on behalf of the Cortez Masto 
language, I wanted to thank the Sen-
ator from Nevada for her legislation 
and just emphasize how important this 
is to people all through the United 
States, including my State. It happens 
to be a border State, but even in Se-
attle, providers are worrying about a 
chilling effect. 
I was wondering if the Senator from 
Nevada—while 
our 
colleagues 
have 
been talking about how this impacts 
individuals, people seeking healthcare 
in other States, what is happening now 
with the chilling effect to providers 
and their anxiety over people pursuing 
them for seeing patients from States in 
which Roe v. Wade is not fully pro-
tected? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I appreciate my colleague from Wash-
ington and the question posed because 
it is exactly part of the concern we 
have. I was home in Nevada just re-
cently, and I am very proud Nevada is 
a pro-choice State. 
Our providers are concerned. There is 
a chilling effect when they are hearing 
other States that are literally crim-
inalizing—looking to pass laws to crim-
inalize 
providers 
for 
providing 
healthcare and a woman traveling 
across State lines. 
What I hear from my providers is we 
want to help women. We want them to 
come to our State, but if their State is 
going to pursue legislation or crim-
inalize or penalize or prosecute us or a 
private citizen can come after us from 
that State, then we are having second 
thoughts about this because they do 
not want to be embroiled in some sort 
of litigation. That is part of this. 
I think it is so important. Thank you 
for the question because that is exactly 
what their intent is. 
These anti-choice States—individuals 
who are taking away the liberty and 
freedom of women are also utilizing 
this chilling effect, this threat, this 
scare tactic for providers, employers, 
and anyone else who wants to help 
women to get to States where they can 
seek this healthcare that they need. 
That is the challenge we see. That is 
why this law is so important because it 
is having an impact on our providers in 
these legitimate choice States like 
ours 
who 
want 
to 
provide 
this 
healthcare. 
Ms. CANTWELL. I want to thank the 
Senator from Nevada. We were joined 
by the American Medical Association 
that also expressed this concern. They 
are speaking on behalf of the providers 
that want to provide reproductive 
choice in States that pass this law, and 
they are concerned. We need to get this 
legislation passed. 
I thank the Senator from Nevada. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator CANTWELL for her leadership 
and especially Senator CORTEZ MASTO 
for her legislation which I am about to 
address. I know that she is running to 
things today—was in the Banking, 
Housing Committee and is doing this 
on the floor. I am so appreciative of her 
time and efforts from housing to pro-
tecting women’s health and protecting 
women’s rights. 
I want to comment on some of the 
things that she said and that Senator 
CANTWELL said about this issue and 
then one specific thing that has hap-
pened in my State, which is outrageous 
and immoral. 
The extreme decision a few weeks 
ago of five Justices took away women’s 
freedom to make their own personal 
healthcare decisions and hand it over 
to politicians. We are also seeing how 
this put women’s health at risk. Sen-
ator CORTEZ MASTO and many others 
on the floor already said that. 
My State is, unfortunately, worse in 
what has happened. Fewer than 10 
hours after the Supreme Court’s an-
nouncement, Ohio’s 6-week abortion

July 14, 2022 
ban took effect. They even banned 
abortion in cases of rape and in cases of 
incest. That night, women across Ohio 
received calls from their doctors let-
ting them know their appointments 
had been canceled. They need to travel 
to another State for necessary medical 
care. Ohio politicians are forcing Ohio-
ans—those that can—to take extra 
time off work to find childcare, to 
spend resources that they may not 
have to travel to get the lifesaving care 
that they need. 
One group at a roundtable I did—I do 
this 
job 
much 
by 
listening 
to 
roundtables of 10 or 15 or 20 Ohioans 
who talk to me about veterans’ care or 
healthcare or, in this case, women’s 
health or jobs or all the things that I 
learn and take back to Washington. 
I did a roundtable recently where I 
was hearing from doctors that because 
Ohio’s laws are so extreme—so ex-
treme—that women and men—espe-
cially women but men, too—young doc-
tors who might do their residency at 
some of the best hospitals in the world, 
the Cleveland Clinic or University Hos-
pital or Cincinnati Children’s or Na-
tionwide Children’s—that doctors are 
having second thoughts about wanting 
to move to Ohio because these abortion 
laws are so radical and so immoral and 
so extreme. 
I am also hearing that prestigious 
colleges or colleges of all kinds that we 
attract—Ohio has more small colleges 
and small universities, private 4-year 
schools, than almost any other State 
in the country. We have great State 
universities in Ohio and great commu-
nity colleges. I am hearing from col-
lege Presidents that students who are 
considering coming to Ohio to go to 
school are having second thoughts, 
again, because of the extremism of this 
legislature on abortion and, as the Pre-
siding Officer knows, the Senate’s ex-
pert on this issue, the extremism on 
gun laws in Ohio. 
One candidate was campaigning for 
Congress in Northwest Ohio, and he 
had a holster—under a new Ohio law, 
he had a holster with a gun in it as he 
was walking along the side of the 
street handing candy to children. It is 
just ludicrous. 
Back to this issue that Senator COR-
TEZ MASTO is leading on. Earlier this 
month, a 10-year-old girl—a child, a 
survivor of rape—was forced to travel 
to 
Indiana 
from 
Ohio 
to 
receive 
healthcare. She was past the 6 weeks. 
Republican politicians first tried to 
deny 
it. 
They 
mocked 
her. 
They 
mocked this—they didn’t know who 
she was at this point. They mocked the 
story. They said it couldn’t be true. 
Then the man who did it was arrested. 
There was no real apology from these 
well-known 
Republican 
politicians, 
Members of Congress, statewide office-
holders. 
They had mocked this story just say-
ing it couldn’t be true when it was 
true. Yet did they apologize? No. They 
should look into a camera—they should 
stand in front of many of us and say: I 
am sorry. They should apologize to 
that little girl’s family, that little 
girl’s doctor, that little girl’s support 
group that she has. 
No 10-year-old—no American—should 
have to go through what she went 
through. Since May, 50 reports of rape 
or sexual abuse involving children 
under the age of 15 have been reported 
in Columbus alone. Fifty—5–0—reports 
of rape or sexual abuse involving chil-
dren under 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10—10 years 
old—children who have been abused 
like that have been reported in Colum-
bus alone. 
I don’t know. Are the rightwingers in 
the legislature who think abortion 
should have no protection—that no 
women should be protected, rape, in-
cest, life and health of the mother, 
that they just deny any of this hap-
pened—are they going to do that again 
and continue to attack these families? 
Now, because of the Ohio Legisla-
ture’s fixation on controlling women’s 
bodies, victims of rape in Ohio won’t be 
able to access the care that they need. 
Even in cases where it may tech-
nically be allowed, doctors will be 
afraid to provide it. I heard the fear in 
doctors’ voices in that round table in 
Cleveland earlier this week. And I 
heard Senator MURRAY talk about this, 
who has joined us in the Chamber. I 
heard doctors talk about the fear that 
their colleagues have to even get near 
a pregnant patient who might have an-
other healthcare issue. 
Women and girls shouldn’t have to 
travel around the country to receive 
care—in many cases, care that will 
save their health or their lives. Doctors 
shouldn’t have to wait on lawyers to 
tell them if they can provide the care. 
Again, the fear of these doctors—these 
were brave women—two women and a 
man—who were talking to me, they 
were talking about the fear in others, 
other physicians, that they are afraid 
they are going to have to wait on law-
yers to tell them if they can provide 
the care their patients need. 
That is what happens when politi-
cians insist on making medical deci-
sions for women and for girls that doc-
tors and the women and girls them-
selves in their family should be mak-
ing. 
Now, anti-choice politicians attack-
ing Senator CORTEZ MASTO’s bill are 
trying to criminalize interstate travel. 
Politicians can’t hold pregnant women 
and girls hostage. Politicians should 
not be able to decide who can travel 
where. This is America. 
In my State, it is Ohio. You are al-
lowed to travel wherever you want, 
whenever you want. As long as you are 
doing it legally, interstate travel is a 
constitutional right. 
That is why the Senate must pass the 
Freedom to Travel for Healthcare Act 
to protect that right, to protect Ohio 
women 
and 
girls, 
to 
protect 
the 
healthcare 
professionals 
who 
serve 
them, all of them. 
When, how, and whether to have a 
family is the most personal and mean-
ingful decisions we make in life. The 
freedom to make those decisions for 
yourself 
free 
from 
political 
inter-
ference should be available to every-
one—everyone. We can’t accept a world 
where our daughters and our grand-
daughters have fewer rights and less 
freedom than their mothers. 
As soon as I heard about that deci-
sion, about the Dobbs case and Roe v. 
Wade, first thing I thought about is my 
wife who will celebrate her 65th birth-
day in 2 weeks, and I thought that my 
mother—my deceased mother—and my 
wife have more rights than my daugh-
ters in their thirties and early forties 
and my granddaughters who are still 
too young to really understand what 
this is about. 
What kind of world is that where peo-
ple of my generation had more rights 
than we are bequeathing to our chil-
dren and our grandchildren? 
I won’t stop. I know Senator MURRAY 
won’t stop working to protect women’s 
freedom—all Americans’ freedoms to 
have life, to have families, and live 
their lives how they want, when they 
want, free from meddling politicians. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yes-
terday, I chaired a hearing focused on 
driving home the devastating repercus-
sions of the healthcare crisis Repub-
licans caused by overturning Roe and 
ending the right to abortion. 
At that hearing, doctors and patients 
and experts spoke directly to the chaos 
and harm Republicans are causing. 
Tens of millions of women across the 
country now live in States where abor-
tion has been banned or is likely to be 
banned soon. 
Republicans have ripped away every 
woman’s ability to decide for herself 
whether or not to keep a pregnancy. 
And it forced them to be pregnant 
when they do not want to be. Repub-
licans are denying women control over 
their own bodies, endangering their 
health and putting patients and pro-
viders in impossible, indefensible situa-
tions: doctors unsure if they can save 
their patients without being punished; 
pharmacists unsure if they can fulfill a 
prescription; people unsure if they will 
be able to get Plan B, unsure if they 
will be able to use IVF to start a fam-
ily and afraid they could get reported 
or investigated or even arrested for 
having a miscarriage. 
And so many women forced to travel 
across State lines to get the reproduc-
tive care they need. People forced to 
drive miles and miles just to get the 
care that could save their lives. Good 
God, this should be unthinkable. But as 
we saw at yesterday’s hearing, that is 
exactly the sort of oppressive regime, 
exactly the sort of nightmare reality 
Republicans have chosen to champion. 
My colleague, the junior Senator 
from Kansas, actually said the fall of 
Roe was ‘‘a positive development.’’ 
Leader MCCONNELL even called it a ‘‘gi-
gantic leap forward.’’ My colleagues

really think the devastation, the harm 
playing out across this country is posi-
tive? That is despicable. 
Of course, another thing we saw at 
that hearing is that Republicans will 
do anything they can to change the 
subject from the damage that we will 
see, to ignore the reality of how deadly 
their policies are. 
News flash: When you force someone 
to be pregnant, they are going to no-
tice; they are going to remember; and 
they are going to be painfully aware of 
the difference between their personal 
decision and the reality Republican 
politicians are forcing on them. 
And the horrifying thing is Repub-
licans aren’t just trying to mislead 
about the real impact of this cruel 
agenda, they are pushing for a national 
abortion ban. And Republican law-
makers have already set their sights on 
ripping away the right to travel. 
Let’s be really clear what that 
means. They want to hold women cap-
tive in their own States. They want to 
punish women and anyone who might 
help them for exercising their constitu-
tional right to travel within our coun-
try to get the services that they need 
in another State. 
I hope everyone really absorbs how 
extreme and how radical and how un- 
American that is. 
I mean, just imagine what bans like 
that would mean for people. In my 
home State of Washington, the city of 
Clarkston is separated from Lewiston, 
ID, by a river—just a bridge, that is it. 
People cross that bridge every single 
day, without a second thought. And 
they cross State borders just like it 
every day, by the millions. 
Surely, we can all agree that crossing 
that bridge, crossing any State border 
to go to the doctor and get healthcare 
you need should not be a crime. Surely, 
that is common sense. Surely, every 
Republican who has railed against Big 
Government could agree with me about 
that. 
I will be honest, based on the shame-
less hypocrisy I have seen this week, I 
doubt it. But we are about to find out 
because we are about to request we 
pass a bill that my colleague from Ne-
vada, along with Senator GILLIBRAND, 
Senator WHITEHOUSE, and I, introduced 
on Tuesday, the Freedom to Travel for 
Healthcare Act. It is telling that some 
Republicans are already saying that 
this is a solution in search of a prob-
lem. 
Well, let’s be clear about the problem 
because it is real and it is imminent. 
Conservative legal organizations are 
right now drafting legislation to ban 
travel for abortion. It was discussed at 
two anti-abortion conferences already. 
Republican Texas legislators are say-
ing out loud they are working with the 
National Association of Christian Law-
makers to draft bills restricting travel 
modeled after their barbaric, vigilante 
abortion ban. And there is already leg-
islation introduced in Missouri to ban 
abortion travel. Anyone telling you 
this is not a threat is not paying atten-
tion or they are just trying to mislead 
you. 
So there is a problem. Now, here is 
the solution. What this bill does is sim-
ple, it protects every American’s con-
stitutional right to travel across State 
lines and to travel in order to get or 
provide a lawful abortion. 
It prevents States from restricting or 
impeding Americans’ right to travel to 
access care and ensures there is legal 
recourse if States attempt to restrict 
that right. 
And it protects healthcare providers 
who are licensed to provide abortions 
in the States where they are prac-
ticing. This should not be controver-
sial. We should all agree, Americans 
have a right to travel within the 
United States and get the reproductive 
care they need. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
this proposal and to work with us to 
make sure that Americans get access 
to the healthcare they need where they 
need it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, recently 
the Supreme Court righted a historic 
injustice, and it was clearly written in 
the opinion by Justice Alito. It said 
this is to return the power to the peo-
ple, return the power to the people’s 
elected representatives, instead of nine 
men back in 1973 in black robes to de-
cide this very important issue. 
It said the people should decide the 
right parameters to protect moms and 
their babies from the violence of abor-
tion. And rather than use this oppor-
tunity to protect life, very soon, the 
Senate Democrats will try to pass a 
very extreme—extreme—abortion bill. 
Remember how extreme our col-
leagues have become on the other side 
of the aisle on the issue of abortion. 
They want to codify the ability to 
abort babies up until the moment of 
birth. 
In fact, we have seen my colleagues 
across the aisle reject trying to protect 
babies that are born alive as a result of 
an abortion. It is chilling. This bill 
that is going to be presented does noth-
ing to help pregnant moms in crisis or 
their unborn babies. 
This bill, just even looking at it, 
which has been hastily put together in 
the last 48 hours, this bill would give 
fly-in abortionists free rein to commit 
abortion on demand up to the moment 
of birth and even—it seems—to perform 
them within a State with strong pro- 
life laws. 
This bill also protects the greed, 
frankly, of woke corporations, who see 
that it is cheaper to pay for an abor-
tion and abortion tourism than mater-
nity leave for their employees. 
We must reject this radical legisla-
tion that will endanger pregnant moth-
ers and endanger their babies. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. I ask unani-
mous consent to speak for up to 10 
minutes prior to the scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise today, along with my colleagues, 
and I want to thank my colleagues, 
Senators MURRAY, WHITEHOUSE, and 
GILLIBRAND, for their good work with 
me on the legislation we are talking 
about today, which is the Freedom to 
Travel for Healthcare Act. 
As you have heard from my col-
leagues and as we know in the past few 
months, we have seen women’s right to 
choose taken away in States around 
the country overnight. 
Less than 3 weeks ago, the Supreme 
Court explicitly overturned Roe v. 
Wade, depriving women of a right they 
held for 50 years. When the Court de-
cided 
Dobbs 
v. 
Jackson 
Women’s 
Health Organization, it repeatedly in-
sisted that its holding would, ‘‘return 
the issue of abortion to the people’s 
elected representatives’’ in the States. 
Forget women, forget women’s rights, 
but let’s give it to the politicians. 
As a result, in 18 States, abortion is 
either effectively banned or will be 
within 30 days. Ultimately, around half 
of States are expected to get rid of 
most or all abortion services within 
their borders. 
In the face of these profound restric-
tions on reproductive health services, 
American women, who are able to do 
so, have had to travel to States, like 
mine, that still protect the women’s 
right to choose. 
Thanks to a 1990 referendum, Nevada 
has enshrined the right to choose in 
statute in my State. That is why we 
are already seeing women make their 
way to Nevada to get the healthcare 
that they need and they deserve. 
But radical anti-choice policymakers 
have been emboldened by the Supreme 
Court decision and its discord and its 
shocking disregard for precedent. Yet 
they are not satisfied with a country 
where abortion is only banned in half 
the States. 
We know now they are working to in-
troduce legislation in Congress to ban 
abortion nationwide. And until they 
can pass it, they want to stop women 
from traveling for critical care and to 
punish 
people 
who 
support 
these 
women. 
Anti-choice State legislators in Mis-
souri, Texas, and Arkansas have said 
they want to pass bills to fine or pros-
ecute women who travel for healthcare 
and do the same to providers who offer 
abortion services and the many em-
ployers who have said they will support 
their employees who need to seek re-
productive care in another State. 
Let me be specific about this because 
this is devastating already to so many, 
including in my State. 
In Missouri, a State legislator has re-
peatedly introduced legislation that 
would allow private citizens to sue 
those who help Missouri citizens re-
ceive out-of-State abortion services. 
In Texas, State legislators have said 
they will introduce legislation to ban 
businesses that help employees travel

to receive abortions. They have also 
written 
cease-and-desist 
letters 
to 
companies like Lyft, Citigroup, and 
even law firms to tell them to stop 
helping employees who seek abortion 
out of State. 
In Arkansas, a State senator has 
called for a law targeting businesses 
helping employees travel for care. 
Let’s not forget South Dakota be-
cause the Governor of South Dakota 
refused in an interview to rule out laws 
that target women who travel for abor-
tion. 
But we are not done yet because we 
also 
know 
that 
some 
anti-choice 
groups are actively pushing for such 
bans. The Thomas More Society, an ex-
tremist anti-choice group, is working 
on draft legislation. Its vice president 
told the Washington Post: 
Just because you jump across a state line 
doesn’t mean your home state doesn’t have 
jurisdiction. It’s not a free abortion card 
when you drive across the state line. 
The National Association of Chris-
tian Lawmakers, an anti-abortion or-
ganization led by Republican State leg-
islators, is also reported to be working 
on similar legislation modeled after 
the Texas law. 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
some States are going to continue to 
move forward with these kinds of legis-
lation. 
I want to note that, quite frankly, 
some of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have tried to have it 
both ways for years, insisting that the 
right to choose was safe—in my State, 
they have done it—at the same time 
they supported increasingly extreme 
limits to it. We even heard nominees 
testify that they would follow Supreme 
Court precedent, including Roe and 
Casey. Yet now we all know those reas-
surances were all false. We have seen 
women’s reproductive rights eroded 
steadily for decades, and we know that 
anti-choice activists won’t stop. This is 
a form of gaslighting, to keep insisting 
that American women will be able to 
get care when we know that anti- 
choice legislators and groups are work-
ing to stop them from doing so. 
What legislators are doing across the 
country to restrict women from trav-
eling is just blatantly unconstitu-
tional. They constrain the fundamental 
constitutional right to travel, they are 
anti-woman, they are anti-business, 
and they are anti-provider. 
Let me just say, merely proposing 
this legislation, merely talking about 
civil action or prosecuting a woman or 
a provider or even an employer who 
helps a woman to travel, is having a 
chilling effect. 
In my State, they are already seeing 
that these proposals are having a 
chilling effect on my providers, who 
are worried about offering quality 
abortion care in the face of potential 
lawsuits. 
In 
Montana, 
reproductive 
health clinics are even limiting care to 
instate residents only. Imagine trav-
eling hundreds of miles for essential 
healthcare, only to be turned away for 
fear of a lawsuit. 
That is why I and my colleagues have 
introduced this bill to make it crystal 
clear: States cannot and must not pros-
ecute women who travel across State 
lines for critical reproductive care. 
Our 
legislation 
also 
protects 
healthcare providers in destination 
States and anyone who helps women 
travel for the care they deserve, from 
businesses to taxi drivers, to doctors. 
Today, we are calling to pass this 
legislation. If my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle believe in States’ 
rights and the liberty of freedom for 
women in this country, they should 
support this bill. If they believe in the 
fundamental right of all Americans to 
travel, they should support this bill. If 
they fail to protect women who travel 
for healthcare and those who support 
them, then they need to go on record 
for the American people to explain 
why. 
I will tell you what. It is not enough 
to stand there and say that somehow 
this legislation is a fly-in abortionist 
legislation. My colleague from Mon-
tana failed to read this legislation. And 
fearmongering at this point in time 
when women’s fundamental rights are 
being eroded in this country is not the 
answer that women and so many Amer-
icans in this country now need. 
What we need is for people to rec-
ommend and support and identify with 
the freedoms that this country brings 
to all of us, whether you are a woman 
or a man in this country. This is about 
the right to choose and make those de-
cisions for women. It is a fundamental 
right. It is an important right. It is our 
healthcare and our decision. We are 50 
percent of this population, and we de-
serve to be treated equally. 
With that, as if in legislative session, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Judi-
ciary Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 4504 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration; further, that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and the motion to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Reserving the right 
to object, this is my first time to be 
able to stand and speak since the Court 
made its decision in Dobbs. I have been 
on this floor I actually don’t know how 
many times talking about the value of 
every single child. 
The conversation today is not just 
about the right to travel and the right 
to healthcare. It is deeper than that. It 
is the right to live. 
The conversation today is not just 
about women. There are two people in 
this conversation—a child with 10 fin-
gers and 10 toes and a beating heart 
and DNA that is uniquely different 
than the mom’s DNA or the dad’s DNA. 
They have a nervous system. They feel 
pain. There is a child in this conversa-
tion as well. 
In my conversation when I have come 
to the floor over and over again, it has 
been to say that at some point our Na-
tion should look at basic science and to 
say when you have DNA and you have 
a functioning nervous system and you 
have cell division, in every health book 
everywhere in the country, they call 
that life, but for some reason, on this 
floor, it is just tissue. 
I actually come to be able to thank 
millions of women and millions of men 
who for five decades have not written 
off children, who have walked out, who 
have 
marched, 
who 
have 
silently 
prayed, who have gathered in places 
and said: When are we going to recog-
nize what is self-evident? That child in 
the womb is a child, and that child 
may be inconvenient, but that is a 
child. When are we going to recognize 
that basic thing? 
For 50 years, that conversation has 
gone on with the simple statement of, 
at what point will we be able to speak 
out for the value of every person, and I 
do mean every person, including the 
mom? 
It has been interesting to be able to 
hear all the misinformation in the past 
couple of weeks. I have read story after 
story and seen all these breathless 
news reports about how women with an 
ectopic pregnancy will not be able to 
get care; they will be doomed to die— 
except there is no State law that would 
prohibit someone getting treatment 
that is lifesaving for an ectopic preg-
nancy in any State. I have seen all 
these breathless reports about how 
there will be miscarriages and you 
won’t be able to get care—except that 
is not true in a single place, not one. 
This over and over riling people up. 
What I have seen are 50 churches that 
have been attacked. What I have seen 
are 57 crisis resource centers for preg-
nancy resource that have been at-
tacked and firebombed. I have seen 
that. Now, we don’t seem to discuss 
that here on the floor. No one is actu-
ally saying that all this conversation, 
all this misinformation, all this noise 
is actually leading to actual violence 
across the country. Everyone is like: 
Oh, no, no; that is not related. Oh real-
ly? So when a pregnancy resource cen-
ter is firebombed and spray painted on 
the side of it ‘‘If abortions aren’t safe 
in 
America, 
neither 
are 
you’’—we 
should probably just ignore that? Be-
cause that is what is actually going on 
across the country right now as well. 
To be very clear, no State has banned 
interstate travel for adult women seek-
ing to obtain an abortion. No State has 
done that. Now, am I confident there 
are some people who are out there 
talking? Yes. But there are also in this 
Senate 5,000 bills that have been filed. 
And how many of them are actually 
going to move—as it is in every legisla-
ture across the country, and everyone 
in this body knows it. Everyone knows 
it. But this seems to be just trying to 
inflame, to raise the what-ifs. 
It has been interesting to me that 
there is another bill that is actually 
being discussed that would literally—if 
you are a pregnancy resource center

dealing with crisis pregnancies, if you 
don’t perform abortions, they would 
call that misinformation. In the other 
bill that is being discussed right now, 
they would fine you $100,000. 
I can’t even begin to explain my emo-
tion when I think, if you take the life 
of a child, there is pressure to say: We 
want Federal funding to take the life of 
a child. If you protect the life of a 
child, we are going to fine you $100,000. 
Is that really where we are? Is that 
really what this debate has become? 
This administration has quickly be-
come the most pro-abortion adminis-
tration in American history and has 
rapidly moved to accelerate abortions 
across the country, while millions of 
other Americans just ask a simple 
question: Does that child in the womb 
have the right to travel in their future? 
Do they get to live? 
Some would say: No. They are ter-
ribly inconvenient. They need to die. 
Others would say: Why don’t we actu-
ally live by our values, including the 
right to life? 
So while there is conversation about 
how to put a piece of legislation out 
that may very well protect individuals 
who are being trafficked to go to other 
States to get an abortion or all kinds 
of other issues that are there, I come 
back to the most basic thing: There is 
a child in this conversation, and maybe 
this body should pay attention to chil-
dren as well and to wonder what their 
future could be to travel in the days 
ahead as well. 
I look forward to the day when we 
are talking more about that little girl 
and less about misinformation. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I would ask for 5 minutes to respond. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I do appreciate my colleague from 
Oklahoma coming here to talk. I dis-
agree with his argument, but I do ap-
preciate his profound belief in what he 
is saying. 
I think it is ironic that the issue here 
before us is really a States right issue. 
It is exactly what Justice Alito did in 
the Dobbs case and referred this issue 
to the States to make that decision, 
and all my legislation says is, respect 
my State. We are a choice State. We 
have made that decision as a State, 
and if women want to travel to my 
State to seek services and my pro-
viders want to provide those services 
and employers want to help women 
travel, then let the States do that. We 
shouldn’t be impeding on those deci-
sions. 
So it is kind of ironic. I hear my col-
leagues talking about, in this case, 
let’s take the emotion out of it, except 
when they want to put emotion into 
the issue, or let’s take the emotion out 
of it when it is not convenient for the 
arguments they are making. 
Let me also address a couple of 
things because now I have learned from 
some of my colleagues, really, the ar-
gument they are going to start making 
is that somehow this legislation is fly-
ing in abortions, which it absolutely is 
not. It is a States rights issue. And no-
body is flying into my State to provide 
healthcare. The actual healthcare is al-
ready there. 
The other thing I have heard, which 
is actually very offensive to me and I 
think to so many, is that somehow this 
is trafficking women. Well, let me tell 
you about trafficking. I know traf-
ficking. I wrote the law to prevent sex 
trafficking and sexual exploitation in 
the State of Nevada for so many who 
were being sexually exploited across 
this country, to hold predators ac-
countable, to make sure that they can 
become survivors. This is not traf-
ficking. And for anyone to stand up 
and say that it is has a complete mis-
understanding. And quite honestly, I 
will welcome you to the fight about 
human trafficking in this country and 
sexual exploitation of women and chil-
dren across the country. That is so of-
fensive. But I am not surprised because 
in this day and age, unfortunately, 
some of these radical ideas coming out 
of this Congress miss what is hap-
pening across this country. 
A majority of Americans in this 
country support the right of women to 
choose because you know why? I don’t 
know what it is like to step in their 
shoes and walk in their shoes and nor 
do you, nor does anyone here. I 
shouldn’t impose my beliefs, my reli-
gion, my ideas on what they should do 
for their lives. None of us should. That 
is the freedom in this country. That is 
who we are when we stand for freedoms 
and liberties. It doesn’t mean we get to 
pick and choose those freedoms and 
take away the rights of the very indi-
vidual because we believe differently or 
our religion thinks that we should do 
differently. That is what we do when 
we come into this Congress and we all 
work together to the benefit of every-
one and not erode their rights and 
their future and their opportunities. 
That is what this is about. 
This legislation is very simple. Let’s 
protect those freedoms. Let’s make 
sure we protect those States rights and 
allow women, healthcare providers, and 
employers to actually support and help 
one another in this country. That is 
what this legislation does. To say oth-
erwise 
is 
misconstruing, 
it 
is 
fearmongering, and a continuing ero-
sion of the debate of the constitutional 
rights and the American rights in this 
country right now. And that is the 
problem with Congress. 
I yield the floor.

July 14, 2022 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, infla-
tion continues to batter American fam-
ilies at a rate we have not seen in 40 
years. Since last year, the prices of 
items that Texans use every day have 
increased more than 9 percent. That is, 
if your paycheck is still the same, you 
have 9 percent less purchasing power 
just since last year. At the grocery 
store, the price of bread is up nearly 11 
percent. Chicken is up more than 17 
percent. And the price of eggs has 
jumped a whopping 33 percent. 
I sense there is a huge disconnect be-
tween the folks here in Washington— 
perhaps in Congress—that this does not 
have a dramatic effect in terms of our 
daily lives; but to the people we rep-
resent, the 29 million people I rep-
resent, this is real, it is happening now, 
and it is to the detriment of their qual-
ity of life. 
Groceries aren’t the only thing that 
are challenging family budgets. Elec-
tricity is up 14 percent. 
I will be traveling with some col-
leagues to the Rio Grande Valley this 
afternoon. I looked at the weather fore-
cast for today and tomorrow. It will be 
104 degrees in the Rio Grande Valley; 
and, no, it will not be a dry heat. And 
demand on our electricity is real be-
cause people cannot live without air- 
conditioning and climate control; but 
in order to run your air-conditioning, 
you are going to have to pay 14 percent 
more for that electricity this year as 
opposed to last year. 
Propane used at summer barbecues 
costs 26 percent more. And gasoline 
prices—there are about 280 million cars 
on the road today that run using gaso-
line. The price has jumped 60 percent 
since last year. If people want to go on 
a vacation, they just commute to 
work, they want to take their kids to 
summer camp, they have got to pay 60 
percent more for gasoline than they did 
last year. And, for the first time, the 
national average price has exceeded $5 
a gallon. Over the last few weeks, 
thankfully, prices have fallen slight-
ly—and I emphasize the word ‘‘slight-
ly’’—but there is no reason to cele-
brate. The national average is still 
about $4.60 a gallon, which is about a 
buck and a half higher than it was last 
year alone. 
So the American people are looking 
to Washington, DC, to their elected 
leaders, and they are wondering: Why 
aren’t you doing something about it? 
They want to know what the Biden ad-
ministration’s plans are to address 
these rising costs, especially when it 
comes to things that are not—I mean, 
there are some things you can sub-
stitute for others. I even saw a woman 
on the news who said she decided to be-
come a vegetarian because she couldn’t 
afford the meat cost in the grocery 
store. But there are some things that 
are simply irreplaceable, and gasoline 
to drive your car is one of them. 
Well, one of the most logical ways to 
increase the supply of gasoline—be-
cause it really is about supply and de-
mand—would be to boost American 
production of our domestic energy sup-
ply. That way, we could reap the eco-
nomic benefits of strong production 
here at home, along with the jobs that 
go along with it. We could continue to 
use our capability to export things like 
natural gas to countries that pre-
viously were dependent almost exclu-
sively on the Russian Federation. 
Actually, the capacity of the United 
States to produce energy at home and 
export it around the world has changed 
the geopolitics of the planet in a very 
positive way. But, unfortunately, we 
see the Biden administration has taken 
a different approach. He knows that a 
part of his political base would have an 
absolute meltdown if the President 
showed anything other than contempt 
for the domestic energy producers. So 
he has come up with a different strat-
egy that, frankly, makes no sense 
whatsoever. 
So he is on a trip to the Middle East. 
He is going to visit with Muhammad 
bin Salman, Crown Prince of the King-
dom of Saudi Arabia, and ask him to 
increase production of oil and gas from 
not the United States but from Saudi 
Arabia. Forget American energy pro-
ducers. President Biden would rather 
go, hat in hand, and talk to an auto-
crat, an oligarch in the Middle East, 
than take his boot off the neck of 
American energy producers. 
So, apparently, the President is not 
anti-fossil fuels; he is just anti-Amer-
ican fossil fuels. President Biden’s trip 
illustrates a remarkable show of his 
priorities. He views the crown prince in 
Saudi Arabia as a more dependable ally 
than energy producers in Texas. 
Well, the decision to shop for oil in 
the Middle East instead of harnessing 
what is in our backyard is absolutely 
baffling. The sooner the administration 
views domestic energy producers as a 
friend and ally rather than enemies, 
the better we will all be off. 
We are fortunate to live in a re-
source-rich country. Growing up, I 
learned in school that countries that 
are endowed with great natural re-
sources have an advantage over other 
countries that do not have those nat-
ural resources. And we do have them 
here in the United States, along with 
the technology to develop them. But, 
for some strange reason, we just simply 
refuse to do so—take what is a gift and 
ignore it completely and go, hat in 
hand, and talk to autocrats in other 
parts of the world and ask them to do 
what we should be doing here domesti-
cally. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Well, Mr. President, on another mat-
ter, I am eager to head home this after-
noon to Texas, where, as I mentioned, 
the weather is a little warm. We have 
been having, I think, about 33 days of 
plus-100-degree temperatures. And as I 
was telling some of my colleagues here, 
no, it is not a dry heat, which is usu-
ally the response when you tell some-
body how hot it is. They say: Well, at 
least it is a dry heat. 
It is not. It is very hot. But it is sum-
mertime in Texas, so we expect it, and 
we adjust to that. 
But we are going specifically to the 
Rio Grande Valley, which is that 1,200- 
mile strip of land that is contiguous to 
Mexico, between Texas and Mexico. 
And we are going with some of our Sen-
ate colleagues so they can see for 
themselves what Senator CRUZ and I 
have seen before and have come to 
learn as a result of talking to the 
world’s best experts in what is hap-
pening at the border, and that is the 
people who live and work there. 
The men and women who live and 
work along our border are the experts 
and the best people to talk to and learn 
from, which is one reason why I con-
tinue to be disappointed that the Vice 
President, having been appointed bor-
der czar or immigration czar, has yet 
to make a substantive visit to the bor-
der to do what we will do this after-
noon and tomorrow, which is to listen 
and learn. And maybe—just maybe—it 
would prompt a change in the failed 
policies which have created a huge hu-
manitarian crisis. Well, the folks who 
live and work on the border know the 
strain this has placed on local law en-
forcement, on their hospitals, on their 
schools, and the danger it creates for 
their communities. 
Just to be clear, I am not talking 
about safety concerns in those commu-
nities. Cities in the Rio Grande Valley 
and along Texas’s southern border are 
not dangerous and lawless places, but 
the people who pass through there can 
be. And amid the 3 million people that 
the Border Patrol has encountered in 
the last year and a half, there, unfortu-
nately, presents opportunities for peo-
ple with criminal records and people 
who are members of gangs and drug 
traffickers to be obscured by the vast 
flow of these 3 million people. 
But once people cross the border, 
they want to get to places like Chi-
cago, San Diego, New York, Seattle, 
Atlanta. These are all places that have 
a presence of the drug cartels. What I 
don’t think enough people realize is 
once the drugs come across the bor-
der—the same drugs that took the lives 
of 108,000 Americans last year through 
drug overdoses—once those drugs come 
across the border, the network by 
which they are distributed is largely 
criminal street gangs, who are also re-
sponsible for most of the violence in 
our communities across the country 
because they are fighting each other 
for territory, for market share, to sell 
these illegal drugs to unsuspecting con-
sumers. 
This is another reason for the spiking 
crime waves that we have seen in re-
cent months across America. People 
want to act like this is something that 
is just contained in cities like Chicago, 
that it is a local problem. No. This is a 
systemic problem that flows from the 
Biden administration’s unwillingness 
to provide any level of controls to peo-
ple coming across the border or to 
deter people from making the long,

dangerous journey and perhaps dying 
in the process. 
I have been in Brooks County, which 
is where the Falfurrias checkpoint is. 
What happens is the smugglers smug-
gle people across the border, they put 
them in stash houses, and then periodi-
cally they will get them in some vehi-
cle and travel up the highway. But that 
is why we have Border Patrol check-
points about 50, 60 miles inland. But 
what will happen is the smugglers will 
tell the migrants: Get out of the car 
and meet me on the north side of this 
checkpoint. 
And maybe, if they are lucky, they 
will get an old milk carton full of 
water and maybe a power bar, some-
thing to sustain them. But I have seen 
the bleached bones of migrants who 
have been left behind and simply died 
in the process, and recognizing the ex-
treme temperatures that exist, particu-
larly at times like this in places like 
Texas, it is no surprise that a number 
of these migrants don’t make it. 
Well, our Border Patrol is simply the 
frontline in our law enforcement ef-
forts along the border; but due to the 
failed policies of the Biden administra-
tion, the Border Patrol is unable to do 
the job that they swore to do, which is 
to defend and protect our borders, be-
cause they are simply overwhelmed by 
the number of people coming across. 
Last month, the Rio Grande Valley 
Sector agents arrested 10 MS–13 mem-
bers, one of the most violent gangs in 
the world, and 2 other gang members 
within a 4-day span—12 gang members 
in 4 days. And that was in just one of 
20 Border Patrol sectors. Since Octo-
ber, the Border Patrol has arrested 
more than 450 gang members, and we 
have already surpassed the total for 
the entire previous year. 
And the scary thing is, these are just 
the ones who were caught, because we 
know, with the volume of people com-
ing across, there are what the Border 
Patrol calls the get-aways, and they es-
timate that as many as 300,000 more 
people are getting across the border 
unbeknownst to the Border Patrol be-
cause they are simply preoccupied with 
these huge numbers, and they get away 
into the interior of the country. 
And once they get across the border, 
particularly if they are people who 
have an intention to do harm and com-
mit crime in the United States, they 
will end up in Boston, Sacramento, De-
troit, Miami, or any other city in the 
United States. 
Somebody said: Well, every city is a 
border city now, and, for all practical 
purposes, that is true. Folks who live 
thousands of miles from the border 
can’t write this off as a problem for 
somewhere else. This is a national 
problem. Gangs and cartels are sending 
their henchmen to our cities and our 
communities. They are trafficking in 
fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, 
and other deadly drugs, along with 
guns and human trafficking. 
They are what one person called 
years ago commodity agnostic. In 
other words, they are in it for the 
money. They don’t care how they make 
the money. They don’t care about the 
people. They are just in it for the 
money. And in doing so, they are ush-
ering in crime and violence and cre-
ating unsafe communities all across 
our country. 
This administration has ignored the 
crisis at our southern border in an ef-
fort to appease open-borders members 
of their political party. They have cre-
ated a gateway for cartel and gang 
members to come into our country and 
wreak havoc on our communities. 
Criminal organizations are very so-
phisticated. Their business model is to 
overwhelm our capacity to stop them 
and to make that buck by selling peo-
ple drugs or other contraband in the 
communities all across our country. So 
the situation at the border is not sim-
ply about immigration. It is about se-
curity. It is about public safety. It is 
about knowing who is crossing the bor-
der and coming to live in your commu-
nity. 
So I am eager to get back home to 
the Rio Grande Valley to talk to some 
of these women who are doing heroic 
work on the frontlines of this crisis, 
who are getting no help from the Biden 
administration. 
As I said, I wish President Biden 
would come to the border. We would 
welcome him and show him what we 
have learned ourselves from our fre-
quent trips there. Maybe if the Presi-
dent saw and learned about the impact 
of the failed policies of his administra-
tion in person, he would begin to take 
this crisis seriously. 
Every State is impacted by the secu-
rity breakdown at the border, and 
something needs to be done before the 
situation becomes even more dan-
gerous than it currently is. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Illinois. 
HIGHLAND PARK SHOOTING 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, 2- 
year-old Aiden McCarthy was lying 
bloodied and pinned underneath his un-
conscious father when he was found— 
just a toddler, Aiden was still in dia-
pers, had somehow lost one shoe and 
was down to just one blood-soaked 
sock, with scrapes across his body. 
It was last Monday, July Fourth, and 
Aiden was rescued from the site of a 
massacre, from the site of the latest 
mass shooting that has marred our 
country and left scarred all those who 
bore witness to its senseless terror. 
I was at a nearby parade in Illinois 
when I heard about the shooting. I 
rushed to the emergency operation cen-
ter and was there the moment the po-
lice came in and told us that two Good 
Samaritans had found this young boy 
sheltered under his father’s body. 
When Aiden was rescued, he kept 
asking for his mom and his dad. But, 
tragically, horribly, we later learned 
that they were never going to be able 
to comfort him ever again. Both his 
mother and father were among the 
seven people murdered during that 
Fourth of July parade shooting in 
Highland Park. Their names were Irina 
and Kevin McCarthy And they, like so 
many of us, had spent that holiday 
morning eager to take pride in our 
country, eager to celebrate the freedom 
and goodness and greatness that has 
defined our Nation since its first 
breaths on that first July Fourth, 
eager to celebrate America at her best. 
Instead, they experienced the very 
worst of it. They saw firsthand what 
can happen when a sick fealty to the 
gun lobby is prioritized over American 
lives. And Aiden is an orphan because 
of it. 
I woke up today unable to get the 
image of 2-year-old Aiden’s one blood-
ied sock out of my mind. I woke up, as 
I have every day since that day, unable 
to stop thinking about how his mom or 
his dad put on his diaper that morning, 
just like I have done thousands of 
times with my own two little girls. 
I woke up thinking about how, when 
the first shots of that military-style 
rifle 
rang 
out, 
his 
parents’ 
first 
thoughts must have been about saving 
him, shielding him. 
So today, I come to the floor to say 
their names and the names of the five 
other victims, my constituents who 
should still be breathing at this very 
moment but aren’t: Katherine Gold-
stein, Jacquelyn Sundheim, Stephen 
Straus, 
Nicolas 
Toledo-Zaragoza, 
Eduardo Uvaldo, and Irina and Kevin 
McCarthy. 
There are too many victims of pre-
ventable gun violence to name all of 
them here. In fact, gun violence is the 
largest killer of children under the age 
of 16 in this country—not disease, but 
the disease of gun violence. It happens 
in Buffalo, in Chicago, in Uvalde, in 
Newtown, in Pittsburgh, in DeKalb, in 
Virginia Beach, in El Paso, in two dif-
ferent Auroras, in Las Vegas. It hap-
pens in wealthy suburban commu-
nities, in low-income rural commu-
nities, and in urban areas across our 
Nation. 
It happens everywhere in America 
but almost nowhere outside of this 
country. It happens so much here that 
we only hear about it in the national 
news when a large enough number of 
people are killed at one time and in 
one place. 
Think about that. Every time gun vi-
olence occurs, someone decides wheth-
er or not the number murdered is wor-
thy of column inches and breaking 
news graphics on TV. And, too often, 
the answer is no because there have 
been more mass shootings thus far in 
2022 than there have been days in the 
year and because we, as a country, 
have grown numb. 
We witnessed that just last week in 
Chicago, as over the holiday weekend, 
Chicago’s death toll climbed even high-
er than the devastation seen in High-
land Park. Yet there was no national 
outcry. 
In Chicago’s communities, gun vio-
lence is now viewed as all too common,

and kids can no longer be kids. They 
have all heard too many stories of tod-
dlers in strollers killed by a stray bul-
let or parents murdered while picking 
up their own kids from school. 
But these everyday gun deaths no 
longer garner the attention they de-
mand. We have become desensitized, 
even as elementary schoolers’ lives are 
being stolen and survivors’ innocence 
are lost. Every gun death is a tragedy 
that can and should be prevented. This 
is a uniquely American disease, and it 
requires a national solution. 
So I am here on the floor today to 
plead with my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to help keep another 
toddler from having to cry out for his 
parents amidst gunshots and terror; to 
help stop another day of patriotism, 
another math class, another trip to the 
grocery store from turning into a liv-
ing nightmare. 
I plead with them to help prevent all 
that by passing the assault weapons 
ban, legislation that would block the 
further sale, transfer, manufacture, 
and importation of military-style as-
sault weapons and high-capacity maga-
zines for civilian use. 
I spent 23 years in the Army. So I 
recognize a weapon of war when I see 
one. I know why you would need to use 
them, the power they wield, and what 
they can do to a human body. 
I understand that the M4, the M16, 
and their civilian variants—known ge-
nerically as AR–15 rifles—were de-
signed for the battlefield. From their 
portability, rapid rates of fire, power 
and accuracy to their effective range, 
these weapons were designed to rip 
apart the human body so your enemy 
cannot get back up and fire back at 
you on the field of combat. 
These are weapons of the battlefield 
and have no business being on our 
streets and in our schools. There is a 
reason why the parents in Uvalde had 
to submit DNA to identify their mur-
dered children. These AR–15 style rifles 
fire small caliber ammunition at a ve-
locity that can easily penetrate many 
kinds of body armor even at a distance. 
So when an unprotected child is shot 
with an AR–15 at close range, the re-
sults are horrific. 
And as anyone who has ever carried 
an M4 into combat understands, the 
American people should not be misled 
into thinking that AR–15 rifles are safe 
for our communities or that a ban on 
fully automatic machine guns is suffi-
cient to protect our children from the 
most dangerous weapons of war. 
Mass shooters are hunting mothers 
in malls, fathers in theaters, and chil-
dren in their schools. For that evil pur-
pose, a semiautomatic rifle is the per-
fect weapon because it is lightweight, 
portable, and easy to load with high- 
capacity magazines. 
It couples the speed of automatically 
chambering the next round after each 
shot with maximum accuracy—a com-
bination designed to kill as many peo-
ple as possible, as fast as possible, as 
efficiently as possible. 
So the first thing I thought when I 
heard the audio of last week’s tragedy 
was that it sounded like war because 
the last time I heard the sound of gun-
fire that rapid and that many rounds 
going off on the Fourth of July was 
when I was serving in Iraq. I never 
thought I would hear that on this holi-
day again, let alone here on U.S. soil. 
And I live, like so many other moms, 
in daily fear that my own daughters 
will be forced to hear that nightmarish 
soundtrack of war in their own class-
rooms or their own local parade. 
You know, a few weeks ago I went to 
talk to my daughters’ class about Me-
morial Day. Both girls’ teachers had 
asked me to come and explain the 
meaning of Memorial Day, to talk 
about the sacrifices of our troops, what 
we have done to safeguard our free-
doms and rights as a nation, including, 
as the Constitution says, our right to 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. 
As I was talking, I happened to look 
outside the window of my older girl’s 
classroom, only to see my younger 
daughter walking in a line, following 
behind the other kids in her class in 
the middle of a shelter-in-place drill. 
And I watched as that little row of 3- 
and 4-year-olds crouched down as small 
as they could get, and my daughter, 
with her head against the wall, put her 
hands over her head, learning to pro-
tect herself should there be a mass 
shooting. 
She is just 4 years old. And she was 
already being taught how to survive if 
someone with a weapon of war comes 
into the classroom where she is just be-
ginning to learn her ABCs, believing 
that their right to fire assault rifles 
matters more than her right to make it 
to age 5. 
What I felt was close to horror. And 
I know other parents have felt the 
same. I am far from the only mom who 
will hug their kids a little tighter 
while putting them to bed tonight, 
then spend hours looking up ballistic 
backpacks to protect my girls in case 
the worst-case scenario becomes re-
ality. But the horrible truth is, even 
ballistic backpacks may not stop these 
rounds. 
This week alone, hundreds of Illi-
noisans and survivors from other mass 
shootings were gathered at the Capitol. 
These people—mostly moms—are still 
recovering from major trauma. And 
they have jobs and childcare respon-
sibilities and no experience lobbying 
Congress. Yet they made the trip to 
Washington, DC, because they know 
that their children’s lives depend on it 
and because they are beyond furious at 
the lack of action to ban these weapons 
of war that have terrorized all of our 
communities. 
What these moms want isn’t impos-
sible. It wouldn’t even be that difficult 
if more folks would grow a conscience. 
These parents want us to do better for 
them, for their kids, for all those in 
Highland Park last week, and for every 
person who has so needlessly lost their 
life to gun violence, whether in a mass 
shooting or in a tragedy involving a 
single bullet. 
The folks at that parade last Monday 
were there to celebrate life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. Seven of 
them will never be able to do so again. 
We have to stop this. We have to end 
this cycle. And we can take a step to-
wards doing so right now by getting 
these weapons of war off our streets 
and passing this bill immediately. 
To anyone who says no, to anyone 
who objects to passing this bill, I want 
to know how you can show off taking 
pride in our country on a holiday, then 
turn your back on its citizens 1 week 
later. I want you to say all the names 
of the ever-growing list of victims of 
these preventable tragedies. 
I want you to remember Aiden’s 
pleas for his mom and dad, to think of 
the sounds of the gunshots that those 
children in Uvalde heard, to try to 
fathom the anguish of the parents 
whose teenagers are gunned down in 
senseless, everyday violence on our 
streets. I want you to explain to them 
why the dollars that you get from the 
NRA are worth their pain, their tears, 
their tragedy. 
Please, I am asking, explain how that 
campaign contribution is worth this 
endless cycle of blood and death. Ex-
plain how your gun-lobbying, fattened 
campaign funds are worth another par-
ent having to bury their first grader in 
their favorite pair of Converse sneak-
ers. 
Or, if you don’t believe those checks 
are worth it, if you don’t actually 
value your political self-interests more 
than those Americans’ 
lives, 
then 
please join me in passing this bill. It is 
that simple. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
GENERAL MARK A. MILLEY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
here today in the Senate to sound the 
alarm about one of America’s guiding 
principles—everybody 
knows 
about 
this—the constitutional principle of ci-
vilian control of our military, very 
much a cornerstone of our Republic. 
This fundamental principle of self- 
government may have been in jeopardy 
during the final days of the Trump ad-
ministration, but before I get to that, I 
will provide a historical context. 
That principle became part of the 
American fabric on June 14, 1775, when 
the Congress of the Continental Con-
gress appointed George Washington 
commander of the Continental Army. 
His commission ordered him to report 
to civilian authorities. 
It specified: 
You— 
Meaning the new General Wash-
ington— 
are punctually to observe such orders and di-
rections, from time to time, as you shall re-
ceive from this, or a future Congress of these 
United Colonies. 
Well, he followed that. At the war’s 
end, General Washington gave this

July 14, 2022 
principle lasting purpose, and he did it 
with power and grace. 
On December 23, 1783, in a solemn 
ceremony at the statehouse in Annap-
olis, George Washington voluntarily 
surrendered his commission, as well as 
his military power, to civilian author-
ity, the President of the Continental 
Congress. The scene is memorialized in 
a dramatic John Trumbull painting 
that is displayed in the Rotunda not 
far from here. All of my colleagues go 
through that part of this Capitol every 
day and probably don’t pay a lot of at-
tention to it, but it is an important de-
scription of our basic constitutional 
principles. 
We know there are other ways of 
doing these things in other countries. 
We know that dictators rule their na-
tions with an iron fist because they 
control the sword. Washington self-
lessly laid down that sword to ensure 
America’s destiny for generations to 
come. He chose to disband the Army 
and return to private life at Mount 
Vernon. 
One scholar explained it this way: 
The Virginian . . . went home to plow. 
By this noble act, Washington ce-
mented a crown jewel of self-rule: civil-
ian control of the military. Five years 
later, as Washington was elected Presi-
dent, this bedrock principle was en-
shrined in our Constitution. 
While this governing rule is essential 
to the preservation of democracy, it 
has been challenged with grave con-
sequences. The Truman-MacArthur dis-
pute over conducting the Korean war is 
a case in point. President Truman 
wanted to limit the war. General Mac-
Arthur disagreed. General MacArthur 
defied orders, and General MacArthur 
criticized his Commander in Chief’s— 
Truman’s—decision, and he did that 
publicly, so Truman fired him for in-
subordination. 
Now I want to get to the main pur-
pose of coming to the floor. Recently, 
several books, including a book enti-
tled ‘‘Peril’’ by Bob Woodward and 
Robert Costa, suggest that the Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen-
eral Milley, may have trampled on this 
principle. The book ‘‘Peril’’ provides an 
alarming account of his words and 
deeds. 
Milley told the authors he ‘‘was cer-
tain’’ that the Commander in Chief was 
‘‘in serious mental decline . . . and 
could go rogue and order military ac-
tion or the use of nuclear weapons. 
Milley felt no absolute certainty the 
military could control or trust the 
President.’’ 
So Milley, in his words, ‘‘took any 
and all necessary precautions.’’ 
‘‘His job,’’ he said, was ‘‘to think the 
unthinkable’’ and, in his words, ‘‘pull a 
Schlesinger.’’ To ‘‘contain Trump,’’ he 
had to ‘‘inject a second opinion.’’ His 
opinion was then injected into the 
command structure. 
In doing so, he may have stepped out 
of his lane as the President’s principal 
military adviser and into the statutory 
chain of command where law doesn’t 
allow him to go because, by law, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
has no command authority. 
When President Nixon faced a crisis 
over impeachment and resignation, 
Secretary 
of 
Defense 
Schlesinger 
feared 
that 
he 
might 
order 
an 
unprovoked nuclear strike. So he, 
Schlesinger, 
reportedly 
took 
extra 
legal steps to prevent it. That is the 
same Schlesinger that Milley referred 
to as he was being interviewed for this 
book. 
It happens that ‘‘pulling a Milley’’ as 
opposed to a ‘‘Schlesinger’’ is a very 
different kettle of fish. A four-star gen-
eral can’t ‘‘pull a Schlesinger.’’ Schles-
inger was at the top of the chain of 
command, just below the President. He 
kept the President’s constitutional 
command authority firmly in civilian 
hands as the Constitution requires. 
Milley 
allegedly 
placed 
military 
hands—his hands—on controls that be-
long exclusively to the President. 
According to ‘‘Peril,’’ the book I am 
referring to, he summoned senior oper-
ations officers in the Military Com-
mand Center to his office. He had them 
take ‘‘an oath’’ not to ‘‘act’’ on the 
President’s orders without checking 
with him first. 
These brazen words and actions, if 
accurate, strike at the heart of our de-
mocracy: civilian control of the mili-
tary. They turn this guiding rule up-
side down and show utter contempt for 
the Commander in Chief. Coming from 
the Nation’s top general, they are dan-
gerous and contrary to military code 10 
U.S.C. 888. 
After describing Milley’s actions, the 
book’s authors rightly ask this ques-
tion: ‘‘Was he subverting the Presi-
dent?’’ Had he ‘‘overstepped his author-
ity and taken extraordinary power for 
himself?’’ 
Milley assured this Senator in a let-
ter to this Senator that his actions 
were on the up and up. The book, how-
ever, seems to imply a different story. 
I had a hearing where the general was. 
Senator BLACKBURN asked him about 
the mismatch. He replied: ‘‘I haven’t 
read any of the books, so I don’t 
know.’’ 
She said to him: ‘‘Read them and re-
port back to us.’’ 
He said: ‘‘Absolutely,’’ he agreed. 
‘‘Happy to do that.’’ 
Nine months later, he is still dodging 
the question with the same lame ex-
cuse. 
To crank up the pressure, I joined 
Senators Paul and Blackburn a few 
months ago in a letter pushing for a 
straight answer. When none came, I 
began sending handwritten notes to the 
general. I soon received a 10-page letter 
from General Milley that ignored the 
question. My second note sparked an 
email. It claimed that our letter did 
not raise ‘‘a direct question’’ and as-
serted ‘‘General Milley answered the 
specific questions.’’ 
I think I can legitimately ask: Is 
that Pentagon baloney or what is it? 
After my third note, General Milley 
responded with the same old smoke- 
and-mirrors routine: ‘‘I have never read 
the books.’’ 
Years of oversight have taught me 
this lesson: Evasive answers usually 
offer revealing clues about the truth. I 
think General Milley knows better. He 
knows the score. If those books and all 
attendant 
press 
coverage 
of 
those 
books contained gross misrepresenta-
tions, we would have heard about it a 
long time ago. He would have ham-
mered the authors and corrected the 
record. However, to date, not a peep 
from the general. His silence speaks 
volumes. 
Something doesn’t smell right. As 
the Pentagon watchdog, when I get a 
whiff of wrongdoing, I sink in my teeth 
and don’t let go. 
So Congressman JIM BANKS, a mem-
ber of the House Armed Services Com-
mittee, and I upped the ante on April 
11. With 12 pointed questions, we gave 
General Milley a second bite of the 
apple to clear the air. Now, 21⁄2 months 
later, we still have no response. 
General Milley, you said you were

I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
FREEDOM TO TRAVEL FOR HEALTH CARE ACT 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to 
offer my own thoughts on the Dobbs 
decision that the Supreme Court ren-
dered a couple of weeks back right 
after we went into a July Fourth re-
cess. 
My colleagues were on the floor ear-
lier advocating for a bill that would go 
after the pernicious practice of States 
in trying to penalize women from trav-
eling to seek reproductive healthcare. I 
am a strong supporter of that legisla-
tion. I understand it will be proposed 
for floor action later today. 
I wanted to focus on two particular 
elements of the Dobbs decision that, as 
a former civil rights lawyer, struck me 
very, very deeply. Never in my life—I 
am 64 years old—has the Supreme 
Court taken away constitutional rights 
that had been counted on by genera-
tions of Americans. The Court has nar-
rowed rights, redefined rights, articu-
lated new standards for judging rights, 
but they have not taken rights away. 
In this instance, the Supreme Court 
took away rights that had been estab-
lished in both Roe v. Wade and Planned 
Parenthood v. Casey. They took away 
those rights for women to make repro-
ductive healthcare decisions and ruled 
that the 14th Amendment to the Con-
stitution—which 
protects 
citizens’ 
ability to enjoy privileges and immuni-
ties of other States and persons’ abili-
ties to be treated equally under the law 
and not have life, liberty, or property— 
be taken from them without due proc-
ess. 
The Court ruled that the 14th Amend-
ment, the Constitution, had nothing to 
do with women’s reproductive rights. 
In 
my 
view, 
that 
is 
a 
horrible

misreading of the history of the 14th 
Amendment. 
Further, the Court went on to say, in 
sort of a sunny way, but no worries. 
You can now rely on State legislatures 
to solve these issues. 
What I want to do is address how 
wrong the Court is about the 14th 
Amendment and how their belief that 
reliance on State legislatures is some-
how a substitute for constitutional 
protection is so fundamentally wrong-
headed. 
What is the 14th Amendment? Before 
the 14th Amendment was passed—this 
is hard to believe—the Constitution 
had no definition of what it was to be 
a U.S. citizen, none. And the pre-14th 
Amendment Constitution also estab-
lished a system of laws in this country 
where you were primarily subject to 
the laws of your State. The 50 States 
could have very different laws. A per-
son from Virginia visiting Maine, for 
example, could be treated by Maine 
laws in a harsh and punitive way just 
because they happen to live in Vir-
ginia. 
That was the way the Nation used to 
be. We were more citizens of States 
than citizens of the United States of 
America. 
The 
pre-14th 
Amendment 
Constitution led to one of the seminal 
decisions in the history of the Court: 
Dred Scott v. Sandford, in 1856, where 
the Court ruled that no person of Afri-
can descent, even a free person, could 
be considered a U.S. citizen. Even if 
their families had been in the country 
for more than 200 years, they could not 
be a citizen. 
In the aftermath of the Civil War, 
this Congress, this Senate, the States 
of this Nation banded together to pass 
three very critical amendments, the 
first, the 13th Amendment banned slav-
ery. 
The 
15th 
Amendment 
banned 
States from blocking people from vot-
ing based on the color of their skin. 
But what the 14th Amendment did, 
finally, after 90 years from the begin-
ning of the Nation, the Declaration of 
Independence, what the 14th Amend-
ment did was define what it is to be a 
citizen of the United States. 
There was a definition, for the first 
time, if you were born here or natural-
ized, you are a citizen of the United 
States. And citizens of the country 
were given rights to not be discrimi-
nated against because of moving into 
other States, privileges and immuni-
ties accorded to all citizens. 
No person shall be deprived of equal 
protection of the law. No person shall 
be deprived of life, liberty, or property 
without due process. For the first time 
in the Constitution, we began to not 
just be a collection of people living in 
50 States but actually have a definition 
of what it is to be an American. 
I don’t have enough time to go over 
the whole history of the 14th Amend-
ment, but where it really begins is in 
World War I. 
In World War I, many States, includ-
ing the State of Nebraska, made it ille-
gal for parents to teach their children 
German. Some even made it illegal to 
learn other languages. We were in the 
midst of the First World War, and so 
States made it a criminal offense for 
teachers and parents to teach their 
children German. 
The case of Meyer v. Nebraska came 
to the Supreme Court in the early 
1920s, a family and an instructor chal-
lenging this State law. And under the 
14th Amendment due process clause, 
the Court unanimously, in an opinion 
by Justice McReynolds, said: Wait a 
minute. What is it to be an American? 
Well, the 14th Amendment doesn’t 
say anything about language instruc-
tion. It doesn’t say anything about 
education, but the 14th Amendment 
created a national identity, and clearly 
being an American must involve the 
ability of a family to decide if they 
want to teach the children their native 
language or practice an occupation, 
elicit a whole series of things that were 
naturally connected with what it was 
to be an American citizen. 
That was the first use of the 14th 
Amendment, to basically say: Clearly, 
if you live in this country, you get a 
zone of protection to make decisions 
that the criminal law of States and the 
Federal Government cannot intrude 
upon. 
A few years later, hard to believe, 
during massive Ku Klux Klan activities 
the State of Oregon made it a criminal 
offense to send your children to paro-
chial schools. There was anti-Catholic 
sentiment that was being drummed up 
by the Klan in Oregon and elsewhere, 
and so now the criminal law of Oregon 
was marshaled against parents who 
wanted to send their kids to Catholic 
schools. 
And, once again, a unanimous Su-
preme Court said: Hold on a second. 
The 14th Amendment says nothing 
about education, but this is a depriva-
tion of liberty in such an extreme way. 
To be a citizen of this country means 
you should have the ability to make 
decisions about the education of your 
children and no State can use the 
criminal law to deprive a parent or 
child of that liberty. 
And just as in Meyer v. Nebraska, 
when the 14th Amendment was used to 
strike down prohibition on foreign lan-
guage instruction, Pierce v. Society of 
Sisters, the 14th Amendment was used 
to strike down a bar on attending paro-
chial schools. 
Fifteen or 20 years later, the State of 
Oklahoma had a statute that said if 
you get convicted of a crime three 
times, you will be sterilized. Passing a 
check, making a false statement on a 
loan 
application—habitual 
criminal 
law, you would be sterilized. That was 
the law that was passed. And it was a 
law that was pretty common in other 
States. In Virginia, for years, people 
were sterilized if the State judged that 
they were ‘‘feebleminded.’’ 
In Skinner v. Oklahoma, the Court 
said: Under the 14th Amendment, it 
says nothing about procreation and 
nothing about sterilization, but could 
there be a deprivation of liberty more 
severe than being sterilized so that you 
can’t have children for life if you were 
in prison for an offense that might be 
just an offense that would have you 
there for a few years? 
And so even though the 14th Amend-
ment didn’t specifically discuss steri-
lization, the Court’s rule was this 
comes with being an American that 
you have some zone where you are pro-
tected to make decisions in your own 
life without the long arm of the crimi-
nal law putting you in prison or, even 
worse, maiming your body and making 
you unable to have descendants for-
ever. 
An important case in Virginia, 1966, 
Loving v. Virginia, Virginia like many 
States made it illegal by the criminal 
law to marry someone whose skin color 
was different. Richard and Mildred 
Loving got married in Caroline County, 
and the police broke into their bed-
room hoping to find them having sex. 
They pointed to their marriage certifi-
cate on the wall. 
They were arrested and jailed. The 
judge said that your only path out of 
jail is to move out of Virginia. They 
moved to DC, but they couldn’t come 
back and visit their families, their 
mothers and fathers and sisters and 
brothers. And eventually, they chal-
lenged the Virginia law, and it went up 
to the Supreme Court. And under the 
14th Amendment, the Supreme Court 
said, Well, yes, the 14th Amendment 
doesn’t say anything about marriage, 
but there is something about being an 
American that gives you the right to 
marry whom you choose without the 
long arm of the criminal law forcing 
you to leave the State of your birth 
and exile yourself from your own fam-
ily. 
And so in Loving v. Virginia, the Su-
preme Court struck down anti miscege-
nation bans, which still existed in Vir-
ginia and many other States. 
A few years later, Griswold v. Con-
necticut, the State made it a criminal 
offense to use contraception. The Su-
preme Court: Well, there is nothing in 
the 14th Amendment about contracep-
tion, but clearly, there is this zone 
where Americans can make decisions 
without the long arm of the govern-
ment throwing them in jail, and con-
traception is one of those areas. 
Roe v. Wade, a few years later, the 
State of Texas criminalizing women 
and providers for seeking an abortion. 
The Court used the same rationale. 
Well, the 14th Amendment, the word 
‘‘abortion’’ isn’t in it, we will grant 
you that, but all the way back to the 
passage of the 14th Amendment and 
certainly back to the Meyer v. Ne-
braska case, we have said that being a 
citizen of this country gives you some 
rights that the government can’t, by 
criminal law, take away from you. 
Since Roe, there has been Casey re-
affirming that right. Since Roe, there 
has been Lawrence v. Texas saying a 
State can’t make it a crime to have sex 
with a same sex partner when they

don’t make it a crime to have sex with 
a partner of an opposite sex. 
Again, the 14th Amendment says zero 
about intimacy or sexual relations or 
reproduction, but there is a zone of de-
cisions we are entitled to make as citi-
zens of this country that the criminal 
law cannot intrude upon. 
Obergefell, you can marry someone of 
the same sex, same rationale. 
So when the Supreme Court said: 
Well, there is nothing about abortion 
in the 14th Amendment, well, they are 
right. The word ‘‘abortion’’ is not in 
the 14th Amendment. But it has been 
clear now for more than 100 years, and 
it was really clear when the 14th 
Amendment was added to the Constitu-
tion that we are no longer just citizens 
of 50 States; we are citizens of a coun-
try that believes individuals have deci-
sion making power and autonomy, and 
the criminal law of this country can’t 
reach in and throw you in jail for mak-
ing decisions about how you operate 
the most intimate areas of your life. 
That is why the Supreme Court’s de-
cision in Dobbs is so destructive. It is 
as if they do not understand the his-
tory of this country before the 14th 
Amendment, when there was no defini-
tion of citizenship, and it is as if they 
do not understand what the 14th 
Amendment was designed to do. 
I will conclude by making one other 
comment. The Court sort of sunnily 
suggests that, well, no worries; abor-
tion now gets no constitutional protec-
tion, but this can be resolved by State 
legislatures. 
It was State legislatures that were 
the problem that the 14th Amendment 
was designed to address. It was State 
legislatures that passed the laws about 
slavery. It was State legislatures that 
prohibited women in the State of Illi-
nois from taking the bar exam. It was 
State legislatures that imposed all 
kinds of restrictions upon the right to 
vote. 
So the notion that, OK, there is no 
constitutional protection for privacy 
anymore, but State legislatures will 
take care of it is a fundamental mis-
understanding. 
And why weren’t State legislatures 
sufficient? 
It 
was 
because 
slaves 
weren’t represented in State legisla-
tures, and women, at the time, weren’t 
represented in State legislatures. And 
so we needed a zone of protection for 
decision making because people who 
have traditionally not been represented 
in State legislatures or this Congress 
can hardly look with confidence on the 
ability of a majority that does not in-
clude them to protect their interests. 
One example, Congress today, the 
U.S. Congress today is about 26 percent 
women. That is our North Star in our 
history. That is the best we have ever 
been. 
Guess what. That ranks us in the 
world, if you look at national par-
liamentary bodies that ranks us about 
75th, below the global average, below 
nations like Mexico, below Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, far below leading nations 
like Rwanda, where more than 50 per-
cent of the legislature is women. 
To say to the women of this country: 
We are taking away rights you have re-
lied upon for more than 50 years but no 
worry, no worry; you can go to the 
State legislature, where you are dra-
matically underrepresented, which is 
the case in most of our State legisla-
tive houses, you can go there, and they 
will give you a fair shake, is to put on 
blinders instead of looking at reality. 
The 14th Amendment was put in the 
Constitution for a reason. It was to 
give a right for individual decision 
making to every citizen in this coun-
try, no matter whether they were po-
litically powerful or not, no matter 
whether there was anybody in the leg-
islative body who looked like them or 
not, and to say that being an American 
gave you those rights and those rights 
couldn’t be taken away couldn’t be 
taken away by the long arm of the 
criminal law in statutes that were 
elected, enacted by State legislatures 
where you were not represented, that is 
why this ruling is so destructive. 
And that is why my colleagues and I 
must work so hard to make sure that 
we don’t devolve back to a pre-14th 
Amendment society, where your abil-
ity to exercise fundamental decisions 
depends upon the ZIP Code you were 
born or live in, but that instead we ac-
cord the right to make fundamental 
personal decisions equally to everyone 
who is an American.

I want to thank the Senator from 
Virginia. He gave a big part of his life 
to civil rights litigation. And if you are 
a lawyer and heard his presentation 
today, you would not want to be on the 
other side of the courtroom. He is con-

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss a critical issue that 
continues to take a heavy toll on the 
health 
and financial well-being of 
Americans: 
high 
prescription 
drug 
prices. 
This uniquely American problem has 
U.S. families paying the highest price 
compared to other countries, leading to 
millions of Americans having to leave 
their pharmacies with their prescrip-
tion drugs left on the table. No one 
should have to go into debt to buy pre-
scription drugs that they need to stay 
healthy, productive, and to have a 
healthy life. 
Twenty-nine percent of Americans ei-
ther cannot afford their prescription 
drugs or are rationing them. And the 
United States stands alone in this 
among the developed nations of the 
world. 
The United States spends approxi-
mately $575 billion annually on pre-
scription drugs, or about 14 percent of 
the total healthcare expenditures. In 
2019, the United States spent, on aver-
age, $1,126 per capita on prescription 
medicines, twice as high as a com-
parable amount spent in the industrial 
world. 
Americans 
and 
Marylanders 
are 
struggling to pay their prescription 
drug medications, and it is long past 
time for Congress to remedy this prob-
lem. Prescription drugs have been life-
saving for millions, but if they are not 
affordable, then their benefit is moot. 
High prescription drug prices drive 
health inequalities that we are fighting 
to eradicate since groups in fair or poor 
health most struggle to afford their 
medications. 
For years, Congress has been working 
on commonsense solutions to increase 
access to affordable prescription medi-
cations, reducing costs for patients and 
taxpayers. It is now time to act. 
U.S. prescription drug prices are set 
through an opaque process by manufac-
turers, pharmaceutical benefit manu-
facturers, and payers. Prices are often 
disconnected from the health impacts 
of the products being purchased. 
Opponents of addressing the high 
drug costs claim that more affordable 
prices will come at the expense of inno-
vation. I say, and the research agrees, 
this is a false choice. To ensure access 
through innovative treatments and 
prescriptions, the U.S. Government 
makes significant investments in bio-
medical research. The Presiding Officer 
knows that very well from his position 
on the Appropriations Committee. No 
greater example of this investment is 
the National Institutes of Health lo-
cated in our home State of Maryland, 
which is the world’s largest govern-
ment funder of biomedical research. 
Almost all drugs rely on NIH-supported 
basic research, and the returns on 
these investments are very high. 
Researchers from the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology have found 
that every $125 million NIH grant leads 
to $375 million more in private market 
value, 33 more patents, and one new 
drug. 
Another study estimates that the 
rate of return on NIH investment is 43 
percent and that each dollar in NIH 
funding leads to an additional $8.40 in 
private 
research 
and 
development 
spending. So the government invest-
ments are well done—it leverages a lot 
more—but the government is the key 
player. 
Further, the Small Business Innova-
tion Research and the Small Business 
Technology Transfer, SBIR/STTR pro-
grams, also support innovation. SBIR/ 
STTR currently are the largest U.S. 
Federal Government programs sup-
porting small businesses to conduct re-
search and investment. SBIR began in 
1982 and currently requires that each 
Federal Agency spending more than 
$100 million annually on external re-
search set aside 3.2 percent of those 
funds for awards to small businesses. 
SBIR is very selective, with only about 
22 percent of the applicants receiving 
funding. For many small firms, the 
SBIR ‘‘serves as the first place many 
entrepreneurs 
involved 
in 
techno-
logical innovation’’—where they get 
their funding. 
Through the SBIR/STTR programs, 
NIH supports drug innovation by set-
ting aside more than 3.2 percent of its 
overall Intramural Research and Devel-
opment budget specifically to support 
early stage small businesses through 
the Nation. Many companies leverage 
this NIH funding to attract the part-
ners and investors needed to take an 
innovation to the market. 
For example, Amgen, which was 
founded in 1980, received SBIR invest-
ment in 1986. Today, it is a multi-
national biopharmaceutical company 
with over 20,000 employees. Despite 
these significant taxpayer investments, 
prescription drugs are often priced at 
levels that limit access to lifesaving 
drugs, particularly among those who 
are underinsured or uninsured. Even 
after accounting for the costs and risks

of research and development, evidence 
shows the returns to new products ex-
ceed normal rates of return. 
Drug companies continue to raise 
prices on consumers without justifica-
tion, and we must crack down on price 
gouging and enforce transparency and 
drug pricing. That is why I strongly 
support the policies the Senate Fi-
nance Committee recently released, 
which comprise of comprehensive re-
form to lower prescription drug prices 
for Americans. 
One policy included in this package 
that I have long supported is empow-
ering Medicare to begin negotiating di-
rectly for the price of prescription 
drugs. This is just common sense. This 
is what businesses do. This is a free 
market. We negotiate. 
In the private sector, no plan sponsor 
or manager would ever accept responsi-
bility without the ability to decide how 
to negotiate. No private sector com-
pany would parcel themselves out in 
order to negotiate; they would use 
their full size as a market force. We 
don’t do that in Medicare. Medicare ne-
gotiations will ensure that patients 
with Medicare get the best deal pos-
sible on high-priced drugs. 
Another policy I support in prescrip-
tion drug affordability is capping Medi-
care patients’ out-of-pocket costs at no 
more than $2,000 per year. Today, there 
is no cap on spending for prescription 
drugs for seniors on Medicare. This pol-
icy will prevent Medicare beneficiaries 
from paying tens of thousands of dol-
lars to purchase lifesaving drugs pre-
scribed by their doctors. 
The policies I have just outlined, 
along with additional reforms—and 
there are several others that are in-
cluded in this package, including a re-
quired rebate if a drug manufacturer 
increases their price beyond the cost of 
inflation. There are other issues here 
to protect the solvency long term of 
prescription drug benefits and Medi-
care beneficiaries. This will make pre-
scription drugs affordable for individ-
uals and families who desperately need 
it. 
I urge all my colleagues to come to-
gether to address this urgent issue. We 
have done the work. Now it is time to 
vote, getting these savings back into 
our constituents’ pockets. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, fol-
lowing my submission yesterday, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD the next part of an inves-
tigation directed by the U.S. Central 
Command concerning the Abbey Gate 
bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
ACTS–SCK–DO 
Subject: Findings and Recommendation—At-
tack Against U.S. Forces Conducting 
NEO at Hamid Karzai International Air-
port on 26 August 2021 
(5) 82nd Airborne Division and 1/82 IBCT. 
(a) The 82nd Airborne and 1/82 IBCT, (as the 
designated 
Immediate 
Response 
Force 
(IRF)), were notified for deployment at the 
request of Gen McKenzie (exhibits 10, 13, 21). 
1/82 IBCT and 2/504 Parachute Infantry Regi-
ment (PIR) began the flow of forces to HKIA 
on 15 August at 2200, and arrived with ap-
proximately 300 personnel (exhibit 121). This 
force coordinated with JTF–CR and occupied 
Camp Alvarado in the northwest comer of 
HKIA (exhibit 121). During the period of 
darkness on 16–17 August, 2/501 PIR arrived 
to HKIA (exhibit 123). Elements of the bri-
gade’s artillery battalion arrived with the 
infantry battalion, making the total force 
about 1000 (exhibit 121). Shortly after their 
arrival, 2/504 began securing the airfield, as 
civilians had breached the South Terminal 
and were on the runway (exhibit 121). 2/501 
were immediately put into the line at the 
South Terminal when they arrived a little 
over 24 hours later (exhibit 121). Both units 
took up security positions on the South and 
West of HKIA, and expanded to relieve Ma-
rines on the perimeter so they could begin 
opening gates on 19 August (exhibits 121, 123). 
By 18 August, 1/82 had security responsibility 
for all of the West side of HKIA. 2/501 had re-
sponsibility for security from the perimeter 
at Abbey Gate westward to the International 
Terminal (exhibit 123). 
(b) The 82nd Airborne TAC, commanded by 
MG Donahue, arrived on 18 August at ap-
proximately 1200 (exhibits 121, 125). Upon ar-
rival, MG Donahue conducted a leader’s re-
connaissance, assessed the perimeter and 
gates, met with RADM Vasely to shore up 
the task organization, and began initial 
planning for withdrawal and JTE (exhibit 
125). The 82nd started clearing the HKIA road 
system to prepare for MASCAL events and 
quick reaction force (QRF) movements (ex-
hibit 125). As part of their security task, the 
82nd detained 40–50 people each night who 
jumped the airfield fence (exhibit 125). Addi-
tionally, 1/82 operated two gates and flowed 
in evacuees via the South and West Gates 
(exhibit 121). From 19–25 August, 2/501 proc-
essed and directed convoys of evacuees the 
Taliban had allowed to pass through the 
outer cordon at South Gate (exhibit 121). 1/82 
opened West Gate periodically to allow pre-
cision evacuation passages of lines, which 
were coordinated movements (exhibits 121, 
125). During the latter half of the NEO, 
South and West Gates accounted for a sig-
nificant number of daily evacuees, averaging 
greater than 200 daily from 24–30 August, 
with 1600 coming through on 26 August (ex-
hibits 125, 143). The DoS Consular rarely 
worked with 1/82 personnel at South Gate, so 
the convoys had to be American citizens 
(AMCITs) or Lawful Permanent Residents 
(LPRs) to get through (exhibit 123). Starting 
19 August, MG Donahue served as the pri-
mary coordinator with the Taliban LNO, 
(TEXT REDACTED) and spoke with him on a 
near daily basis (exhibit 23, 125). 1/82 IBCT 
subordinate unit commanders coordinated 
directly with the Taliban local gate com-
manders for security and to facilitate evac-
uee movements (exhibits 121, 123, 125).

(c) As part of withdrawal and JTE plan-
ning, the 82nd TAC developed a plan for a re-
lief in place (RIP) at the gates and estab-
lished timelines to facilitate withdrawal of 
the Marines from HKIA (exhibit 125). U.S. 
and U.K. Forces negotiated the timeline for 
closing Abbey Gate, and after changing the 
timeline multiple times, eventually settled 
on 0900 on 27 August. While the U.S. Forces 
wanted to close the gate as early as 24 Au-
gust, the U.K. Forces needed more time to 
finish processing their evacuees (exhibits 121, 
125). On 25 August, Bravo Company, 2/501 PIR 
moved behind’ Abbey Gate to facilitate the 
RIP, however the timeline moved to the 
right (exhibits 123, 124). (TEXT REDACTED) 
2/501 PIR, attended a meeting at 1600 on 26 
August with the Taliban, the U.K., and 2/1 
Marines to discuss the RIP and passage of 
lines for the U.K. (exhibit 123). They agreed 
the U.K. would pass through Abbey Gate in 
the early morning hours of 27 August, the 
Marines would shut the gate, and Bravo 
Company, 2/501 PIR would take over security 
of Abbey Gate (exhibit 124). Shortly after the 
meeting, the attack on Abbey Gate occurred 
(exhibits 66, 123, 125). (TEXT REDACTED) 
sent his QRF, Delta Company, over to Abbey 
Gate, and dispatched his field litter ambu-
lances (FLAs) to assist in the casualty evac-
uation (CASEVAC) (exhibit 123). Addition-
ally, he set up his Role I facility inside 
Abbey Gate to assist in treating the wounded 
(exhibit 123). The Marines closed the gate 
immediately after the attack and conducted 
the RIP with Bravo Company, 2/501 PIR at 
approximately 0500 on 27 August (exhibit 
124). The U.K. Forces passed through Abbey 
Gate at approximately 0700 on 27 August (ex-
hibits 124, 127). Bravo Company maintained 
security at Abbey Gate until their departure 
from HKIA at approximately 2355 on 30 Au-
gust. 
(d) As part of JTE execution, 82nd Airborne 
took responsibility for demilitarization ef-
forts at HKIA (exhibits 125, 156, 157, 158, 159, 
160, 161, 162). Millions of rounds of ammuni-
tion, weapons, numerous military vehicles 
and aircraft, and U.S. Government property 
had to be destroyed or rendered inoperable 
(exhibit 125). The 82nd Airborne assigned 
zones of responsibility to the various units 
occupying HKIA to ensure they executed a 
methodical demilitarization plan and no in-
formation or equipment was missed (exhibits 
125, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162). Cyber ele-
ment subject matter experts ensured com-
puter systems were corrupted or destroyed, 
and engineers dug trenches to cover equip-
ment with cement and bury it before depar-
ture from HKIA (exhibits 125, 156, 157, 158, 
159, 160, 161, 162). 
(e) The 82nd Airborne departed HKIA and 
completed the JTE at approximately 0002 
local on 31 August (exhibit 246). 
(6) 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. 
(a) The 24th MEU was a II Marine Expedi-
tionary Force (MEF)/Camp Lejeune based 
unit, aligned to U.S. European Command 
(EUCOM) for the first half of their deploy-
ment (exhibits 100, 102). In June 2021, the 
Secretary of Defense Orders Book realigned 
the MEU to CENTCOM in anticipation of a 
NEO (exhibits 100, 102). Throughout May and 
June, the MEU conducted NEO planning 
with JTF–CR, and executed a PDSS to HKIA 
in July (exhibits 100, 102). The MEU postured 
Marines ashore at Ahmed al-Jaber Air Base, 
Kuwait (Al-Jaber) in July to prepare for the 
potential NEO (exhibits 100, 102). Preparation 
included multiple rehearsals for a NEO, ECC 
operations, airfield security, and gate oper-
ations (exhibits 100, 101). These rehearsals 
continued throughout July, into August, 
until the MEU received notification they 
would deploy to HKIA on 13 August (exhibits 
100, 101, 102). 
(b) 
The 
MEU 
originally 
planned 
to 
frontload its ECC forces for deployment, but 
the dynamic situation at HKIA forced the 
MEU to prioritize 1/8 Marines to ensure they 
had the necessary combat power on the 
ground (exhibit 102). On 14 August at ap-
proximately 0200, one rifle company from 1/8 
Marines, a 1/8 Marines HQ element, to in-
clude 1/8 Battalion (TEXT REDACTED) and 
one logistics company from CLB–24 (CLB 
from 24th MEU) arrived at HKIA (exhibit 
102). The size of the force on the ground in-
creased with the arrival of two more rifle 
companies, 1/8 Marines battalion enablers 
(snipers, engineered, scouts), and some MEU 
CE personnel, to include the MEU (TEXT 
REDACTED) that evening (exhibit 102). The 
1/8 Marines elements secured North Gate and 
sought to begin processing evacuees through 
the ECG, but civilians came through the 
South Terminal area and flooded the runway 
(exhibits 102, 104). This MEU force rebuffed 
the breach of the airfield on the night of 15 
August and throughout the day of 16 August 
(exhibits 15, 18, 100, 102, 104): Echo Company, 
2/1 Marines reinforced 1/8 early in the morn-
ing of 16 August, and after they forced the 
crowds off the runway, another breach oc-
curred at a new opening in the southern pe-
rimeter (exhibit 104). The Marines spent all 
of 16 August controlling crowds and clearing 
runways as more forces, specifically Taliban 
and NSU, became available (exhibit 104). 
(c) On 17 August, 1/8 Marines began estab-
lishing security at the North and East Gates 
and attempted to begin processing evacuees 
(exhibit 104). North and East Gates had ap-
proximately 3000–5000 people outside at any 
given time starting on 17 August (exhibit 
102). JTF–CR maintained TACON of the MEU 
throughout the NEO, even after the change 
to COMREL on 17 August (exhibits 10, 11). 
24th MEU retained TACON of 1/8 Marines, 
but only nominally had TACON of 2/1 Ma-
rines, whose Battalion Commander reported 
directly to the JTF–CR Commander (exhibit 
53, 77, 100). 
(d) From 17 August until departure on 30 
August, 24th MEU managed tactical execu-
tion of the NEO, which primarily included 
security and initial screening at North, East, 
and Abbey Gates and processing evacuees at 
the ECC (exhibits 100, 104). 1/8 received near-
ly all of its combat power by the end of 18 
August (exhibit 104). CLB–24 established the 
ECC at the PAX Terminal in North HKIA 
and was processing evacuees as early as 15 
August (exhibit 101). During the NEO, CLB– 
24 Marines also conducted various support 
activities to resupply the gates, and assisted 
with base life support operations (exhibit 
101). CLB–24 planned for contractors, to con-
tinue providing base support throughout the 
NEO, but many contractors departed early 
on, forcing the CLB to absorb those support 
responsibilities, in addition to operating the 
ECC (exhibit 101). The SPMAGTF’s Combat 
Logistics Detachment assisted CLB–24 with 
providing combat service support to units at 
HKIA (exhibit 101). 
(e) BLT 1/8 Marines assumed responsibility 
for security of North and East Gates, and the 
perimeter around the East side of HKIA after 
the 82nd Airborne arrived (exhibit 104, 155). 
Gate operations for North and East Gates 
were difficult and sporadic (exhibits 100, 102, 
104). North Gate was vulnerable to attack 
due to a lack of standoff, an absence of ob-
stacles or barriers, and proximity to civilian 
roads (exhibits 100, 102, 104). North Gate 
quickly became the hardest gate to control 
(exhibit 100). East Gate was a single gate, 
which was always at risk of being forced 
open by the crowd, because there was no 
standoff (exhibits 100, 102, 104). Marines at 
East Gate dealt with crowds crushing people 
against the perimeter wall, making it dif-
ficult to open the gate (exhibit 102). The 
Taliban provided support at both North and 
East Gates, but the Taliban commander at 
North Gate was the least helpful (exhibits 
125, 146). North, East, and Abbey Gates closed 
from 20–22 August due to a lack of flights 
and capacity within HKIA. In total, there 
were 18000 evacuees waiting to fly out, which 
created a humanitarian and security prob-
lem (exhibits 102, 104). The JTF–CR Com-
mander closed North Gate from 23–25 August, 
except for some targeted entries, because of 
the VBIED threat (exhibits 100, 102). East 
Gate closed permanently on 24 August be-
cause of the threat of mortars from the 
Taliban, and an inability to process evacuees 
without losing control of the gate (exhibits 
100, 102, 104). By 25 August, Abbey Gate was 
the only gate operating in the MEU’s sector 
of HKIA (exhibit 102). 
(f) Aside from 1/8 Marines’ rifle companies, 
additional MEU elements supported gate op-
erations. BLT 1/8’s (TEXT REDACTED) 
tasked his engineer platoon to support 
North, East, and Abbey Gates (exhibits 103, 
104). The engineers spent a disproportionate 
amount of time improving East Gate, shor-
ing up gaps in the perimeter to prevent fence 
jumpers, and removing towers on the exte-
rior of the perimeter (exhibit 103). The engi-
neers emplaced shipping containers to form 
the obstacle at the southern end of Abbey 
Gate, later known as the Chevron, on the 
morning of 20 August (exhibit 103). Other-
wise, support to Abbey Gate was limited (ex-
hibit 103). CLB–24 provided the bulk of the 
personnel assigned to the Female Search 
Team (FST), and tasked them to support the 
gates and the ECC (exhibit 101). The FST 
began with searching women and children 
prior to DoS screening, then transitioned to 
conducting 
initial 
searches 
outside 
the 
gates, escorting rejected females out through 
the gates, and helping identify eligible evac-
uees in the crowds (exhibit 107). The MEU 
Commander re-task organized the 2nd Recon-
naissance (Recon) element to work directly 
for him later in the NEO, specifically to con-
duct targeted recovery of privileged per-
sonnel (exhibit 108). Recon element per-
sonnel were at the gates constantly, working 
with 1/8 and 2/1 Marine leaders to identify 
and pull specific people from the crowd for 
processing (exhibit 108). The MEU also orga-
nized PSYOP and cyber assets under the di-
rection of the MEU (TEXT REDACTED) for 
employment at the gates (exhibit 105). The 
PSYOP teams employed capabilities at the 
gates to communicate with the crowds, and 
provided updates on required documents or 
gate closures (exhibit 105). 
(g) On 26 August, all the gates in the MEU 
sector of HKIA were closed, with the excep-
tion of Abbey Gate and occasional targeted 
recoveries at North Gate (exhibits 102, 104). 
The IED threat was well known across the 
MEU, but threats lacked specifics on times 
and locations (exhibits 100, 102, 104, 105, 106, 
107). MEU leadership ensured electronic 
countermeasures (ECM) were active at the 
gates, dispersion of personnel was enforced 
to the greatest extent possible, snipers were 
in overwatch, PSYOP personnel commu-
nicated the threat to the crowd and asked 
people to leave, and medical assets were 
repositioned (exhibit 100). At the time of the 
blast, only the PSYOP, FST, and Recon ele-
ments of the MEU were at Abbey Gate (ex-
hibits 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108). 
The paragraphs below detail the actions of 
these personnel. The MEU JOC immediately 
put additional intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance (ISR) assets over Abbey 
Gate, scanning for additional threats (ex-
hibit 102). Post-blast, 1/8 Marines shifted se-
curity elements to Abbey Gate to help fill 
gaps, and provided numerous vehicles for 
CASEVAC, assisting in movement to the 
HKIA Role 11–E. CLB–24 also provided nu-
merous CASEVAC vehicles to support the 
MASCAL (exhibit 101).

(h) On 27 August, all gates were essentially 
shut in the MEU sector and 1/82 IBCT secured 
Abbey Gate (exhibits 53, 56, 57, 100, 102, 104). 
CLB–24 continued to operate the ECC until 
30 August, processing evacuees until two 
hours before their departure from HKIA. The 
MEU retrograded back to Kuwait primarily 
on 29–30 August, with the last elements de-
parting at approximately 1000 on 30 August 
(exhibit 100). 
(7) Special Purpose Marine Air Ground 
Task Force, Ground Combat Element (GCE), 
2/1 Marines. 
(a) 2/1 Marines were the GCE for the 
CENTCOM SPMAGTF, located primarily in 
Camps across Kuwait and Prince Sultan Air-
base (PSAB) in Saudi Arabia (exhibit 53). In 
July 2021, the SPMAGTF received notice it 
would potentially participate in NEO in Af-
ghanistan (exhibit 53). The SPMAGTF ini-
tially task organized a ‘‘NEO Light’’ pack-
age, consisting of elements of Combat Logis-
tics Detachment (CLD) and the crisis re-
sponse company (Echo Company, 2/1) (exhib-
its 53, 54, 55). The ‘‘Light’’ package elements 
executed two mission rehearsals testing 
their ECC and gate operations, prior to de-
ployment to HKIA (exhibits 53, 54, 55). In Au-
gust, the SPMAGTF would task organize and 
deploy a ‘‘Heavy’’ package, that included the 
rest of 2/1 Marines’ rifle companies (exhibits 
53, 54, 55). 
(b) 2/1 first arrived to HKIA at approxi-
mately 0100–0200 on 16 August (exhibits 53, 54, 
55, 56, 57). The first flight included the Bat-
talion HQ, Echo Company leadership, and 
one platoon from Echo Company (exhibits 54, 
56). Upon arrival, the unit found the airfield 
breached by civilians, who were moving onto 
the runways (exhibits 54, 56). The Battalion 
(TEXT REDACTED) immediately tasked 
Echo Company to assist with clearing the 
runway, in hopes of resuming flight oper-
ations (exhibit 54). Over the next 24 hours, 
Echo Company was part of the line holding 
the southern perimeter with 3/10 IBCT, 1/82 
IBCT, and 1/8 Marines (exhibit 56). There 
were several breaches of the perimeter and 
crowds gained access to the runway, at-
tempted to board C–17s, and pushed towards 
the North HKIA compounds (exhibits 56, 76). 
Forces pushed the crowds back after NSU 
units joined the line, and the crowds recog-
nized there were no more flights to board 
(exhibits 56, 76). 2/1 Marines, specifically 
Echo Company, were part of the security pe-
rimeter at HKIA from approximately 0600 on 
16 August until 19 August, when they were 
relieved by units from 1/82 IBCT (exhibit 53). 
(c) Force flow over the next two days 
brought in parts of the 2/1 Battalion HQ, Fox 
Company (-), Golf Company, Weapons Com-
pany, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) 
teams, the Shock Trauma Platoon (STP), 
and finally the remainder of Echo Company 
(exhibits 56, 76, 65, 66). These units focused on 
securing the southern perimeter from the 
Domestic Terminal to Abbey Gate from 17–19 
August (exhibit 76). Once 1/82’s relief of the 
perimeter began, Golf Company, Fox Com-
pany 
(-), 
Combined 
Anti-Armor 
Team 
(CAAT) platoons, and Battalion Snipers 
moved to Abbey Gate (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 
83, 89). U.K.’s 2 PARA were at the outer 
Abbey Gate, as well as Air Force Pararescue 
(PJ) personnel and small partner nation ele-
ments (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 89). After initially 
planning; to push from Abbey Gate to Camp 
Sullivan, 2/1 Marines opted not to execute 
due to the size of the crowds and lack of 
Taliban support to extend the perimeter (ex-
hibits 53, 76, 81). Instead, (TEXT RE-
DACTED) tasked the battalion to open the 
outer gate to begin processing evacuees (ex-
hibits 53, 76, 81, 89). Opening the gate re-
quired an entire platoon, sometimes rein-
forced, to keep the crowds from breaching 
the outer gate and accessing the Abbey 
Gate’s inner corridor (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 
89). 2/1 Marines processed approximately 750 
evacuees through Abbey Gate on 19 August, 
but only after tremendous effort to hold the 
gate (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 89). 
(d) In order to enable safe and efficient 
gate operations, (TEXT REDACTED) Golf 
Company, 2/1 (TEXT REDACTED) decided to 
push the crowds back to an area beyond the 
Barron Hotel egress lane. This would ensure 
U.K. Forces had better access to the gate 
from their evacuee staging area (exhibits 53, 
77, 89). In the early morning hours of 20 Au-
gust, platoons from Golf and Fox Companies 
opened the outer gate, and methodically 
forced the smaller crowd back nearly 200 me-
ters (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 89). (TEXT RE-
DACTED) coordinated with U.K. Forces and 
MEU Engineers to emplace six shipping con-
tainers in the main south to north roadway 
leading to Abbey Gate to form a disrupting 
obstacle and aid in crowd control (exhibits 
53, 76, 77, 81, 88, 89). The Taliban agreed to 
provide outer security beyond the con-
tainers, and the U.K. Forces and 2/1 provided 
security inside the containers, guarding the 
Barron Hotel egress route and canal areas 
(exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 88, 89). The containers 
became known as the ‘‘Chevron’ (exhibits 18, 
21, 53, 76, 77, 81, 88, 89). The emplacement of 
the Chevron on 20 August established the 
structural layout of Abbey Gate for the du-
ration of the NEO, as depicted in enclosures 
12 and 13.

250TH ANNIVERSARY OF BUXTON, 
MAINE 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
rise today to commemorate the 250th 
anniversary of the town of Buxton, ME. 
It is a great pleasure to celebrate the 
generations of industrious and caring 
people who have made Buxton a won-
derful place to live, work, and raise 
families. 
Named for the famous spa town in 
England, Buxton has a rich history. 
For thousands of years, the Saco River 
Valley was home to the Abenaki. In 
1728, the Massachusetts General Court 
granted land to establish a settlement 
that was called Narragansett Number 
One. As the population grew, the town 
of Buxton was incorporated on July 14, 
1772. 
The early settlers turned the dense 
forests and fertile soil into a thriving 
lumber industry and productive farms. 
With the Saco River providing power, 
sawmills and gristmills were built, fol-
lowed 
by 
woolen 
mills, 
tanneries, 
churches, libraries, and flourishing re-
tail stores. 
Education 
has 
been 
central 
to 
Buxton from the start. The first 
schoolmaster arrived in 1761, more 
than a decade before incorporation. 
Soon, 17 homes in town hosted one- 
room schools so that every youngster 
was within walking distance. 
Buxton’s early prosperity as an in-
dustrial center produced many fine ex-
amples of New England architecture. 
Today, several homes, businesses, and 
the First Congregational Church are 
listed on the National Register of His-
toric Places. 
Also on the Register is the Buxton 
Powder House, built by the towns-
people at a cost of $59 to store ammuni-
tion and arms during the War of 1812. 
Since then, the people of Buxton have 
joined together to erect monuments 
and memorials in tribute to the patri-
ots 
who 
have 
defended 
freedom 
throughout our Nation’s history. 
The spirit that built Buxton is evi-
dent today in many ways. Countless 
volunteers have come together to make 
the town’s sestercentennial a memo-
rable celebration. For nearly 30 years, 
townspeople have generously supported 
the Buxton Toy Box that helps bring 
holiday cheer to children. Buxton’s ac-
tive involvement on the Saco River 
Corridor Commission shows a commit-
ment to protect the natural resources 
that are vital to the quality of life. 
Nothing 
better 
demonstrates 
the 
Buxton spirit than a special moment at 
this year’s annual town meeting on 
June 18, when the townspeople honored 
Deputy Chief Gene Harmon of the 
Buxton Fire-Rescue Department for 60 
years of dedicated service to his com-
munity and his neighbors. 
Buxton’s 250th anniversary is a time 
to celebrate the people who pulled to-
gether, cared for one another, and built 
a great community. Thanks to those 
who came before, Buxton, ME, has a 
wonderful history. Thanks to those 
there today, it has a bright future.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE STENNIS PRO-
GRAM FOR CONGRESSIONAL IN-
TERNS 
∑ Mr. WICKER. Madam President, a 
number of our congressional interns 
this summer have greatly profited from 
a program conducted by the Stennis 
Center for Public Service. The Stennis 
Program for Congressional Interns is 
designed to enhance the internship ex-
perience for exceptional future leaders, 
giving them an inside look at how Con-
gress works and enabling them to learn 
from senior staffers across both par-
ties. These bipartisan relationships 
will serve them well throughout their 
future careers supporting Congress. 
Interns are selected based on their 
employment experience, college course 
load, and prospective service to Con-
gress. This summer, 18 interns were 
chosen 
for 
this 
prestigious 
oppor-
tunity. These interns serve us on both 
sides of the aisle, working for Demo-
crats and Republicans in both the 
House and Senate. 
I congratulate the interns on com-
pleting this distinguished program. I 
also thank the Stennis Center and 
their 
Senior 
Stennis 
Congressional 
Staff Fellows for providing a meaning-
ful experience and promoting bipar-
tisan work. 
I ask that the names of the 2022 Sum-
mer Stennis Congressional Interns and 
the offices in which they serve be 
printed in the RECORD.

RECOGNIZING THE KANSAS CITY, 
KANSAS, POLICE DEPARTMENT 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize Cap-
tain James Grasela III, Sergeant Lee 
Ann 
Shelton, 
and 
Officer 
Dallas 
Thompson of the Kansas City, KS, Po-
lice Department. 
On January 7, 2022, while the Kansas 
City Police were conducting a burglary 
investigation, Officer Thompson found 
pills crumpled in an envelope belonging 
to a detained suspect. Captain James 
Grasela immediately recognized the 
pills as ones which might be laced with 
fentanyl. Officer Thompson did every-
thing by the book: placed the pills and 
envelope in an evidence bag, sealed it, 
and removed his gloves, yet just min-
utes later, he dropped to the ground, 
struggling to breathe. It was only 
through the quick action of Captain 
Grasela and the other officers on the 
scene that Officer Thompson was able 
to survive. 
If the officers had not been there to 
administer emergency medication, Of-
ficer Thompson would not have made it 
home to his two daughters. Thank-
fully, this accidental overdose did not 
end in tragedy. Unfortunately, deaths 
involving Fentanyl are not uncommon 
in this country. Fentanyl kills more 
Americans than any other drug and is 
a clear threat to our society. The fact 
that it takes less Fentanyl than can fit 
on the tip of a pencil to kill someone 
makes this crisis even more severe. 
I want to honor these officers for ev-
erything they do to protect our citi-
zens from the dangers of fentanyl. 
They put their lives on the line every 
day to shield Americans from this cri-
sis, as seen this past January. I now 
ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the bravery of our Kansas City, 
Kansas, police officers and to honor 
them for their dedication to protecting 
their 
fellow 
Americans 
from 
the 
scourge of Fentanyl.∑

Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. BOOZMAN, and Mr. 
WICKER) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry: 
S. RES. 709 
Whereas the George McGovern-Robert Dole 
International Food for Education and Child 
Nutrition Program (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘McGovern-Dole Program’’) has 
improved the food security, nutrition, lit-
eracy, and primary education of school-age 
children, particularly young girls, and their 
families in over 48 countries in just 2 dec-
ades; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program was 
established by section 3107 of the Farm Secu-
rity and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 
U.S.C. 1736o–1) to procure agricultural com-
modities and provide financial and technical 
assistance to carry out preschool and school 
food for education programs in foreign coun-
tries and maternal, infant, and child nutri-
tion programs for pregnant women, nursing 
mothers, infants, and children who are 5 
years of age or younger; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program has 
provided over 5,500,000,000 school meals bene-
fitting over 31,000,000 school-age children and 
their communities; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program has 
been successfully administered by the For-
eign Agricultural Service of the Department 
of Agriculture; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program is a 
key program of the Department of Agri-
culture aligned with the governmentwide 
Global Food Security Strategy; 
Whereas in fiscal year 2021 alone, McGov-
ern-Dole Program projects have directly ben-
efitted more than 4,500,000 children and com-
munity members through the distribution of 
United States-produced commodities that 
provide daily nutritious and high-quality 
meals and mitigate food insecurity; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program part-
ners with farmers in the United States, who 
provide 46,770 metric tons (‘‘MT’’) of food 
commodities in support of fiscal year 2021 
McGovern-Dole Program grants in Central 
America, Africa, and Asia; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program com-
plements United States agricultural com-
modities with food grown and purchased lo-
cally to support farmers and markets within 
the recipient’s own communities and to build 
the capacity of local governments and com-
munities to continue and sustain the bene-
fits of the McGovern-Dole Program into the 
future; 
Whereas during the COVID–19 pandemic 
when school closures were commonplace, the 
McGovern-Dole Program effectively shifted 
from providing meals in schools to providing 
take-home rations and distributed approxi-
mately 23,000 MT of commodities donated by 
the United States and 550 MT of locally pro-
cured commodities to more than 1,700,000 
McGovern-Dole Program participants and 
their families across 26 active projects, en-
suring that children continued to receive 
daily meals and learn while at home; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program rec-
ognizes the value of educating young girls 
and contributes to overcoming the barriers 
they encounter in accessing a high-quality 
education by promoting equality and the re-
duction of gender-based violence; 
Whereas school meals provide an incentive 
for families to send girls to school and help 
girls to stay in school, effectively preventing 
early marriage and delaying first pregnancy, 
which can trap young women in poverty and 
limit their future potential; 
Whereas 
the 
McGovern-Dole 
Program 
strengthens local community health and 
education through the formation of parent- 
teacher associations, teacher training, and 
improving the infrastructure of schools, 
classrooms, commodity storerooms, latrines, 
and water sources; and 
Whereas the United States, as a member of 
the Global School Meals Coalition, is com-
mitted to and recognizes that investments in 
the McGovern-Dole Program, are central to 
bolstering food security, building resilience 
to future shocks, and supporting the nutri-
tional, health, and educational needs of chil-
dren and adolescents worldwide: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that the United States is committed to— 
(1) building upon the 20 years of successful 
work of the George McGovern-Robert Dole 
International Food for Education and Child 
Nutrition Program (in this resolution re-
ferred to as the ‘‘McGovern-Dole Program’’) 
and its positive role in breaking cycles of 
hunger and poverty, providing opportunity 
through education and literacy, and improv-
ing overall nutrition and health; 
(2) complementing humanitarian assist-
ance 
efforts 
and 
development 
programs 
through the continued implementation of 
the McGovern-Dole Program that addresses 
global food insecurity and creates conditions 
for peace and stability; and 
(3) supporting United States farmers, mil-
lers, shippers, and commodity groups that 
provide agricultural commodities for use in 
the McGovern-Dole Program to help combat 
global malnutrition and food insecurity and 
advance global education.

SENATE RESOLUTION 712—RECOG-
NIZING THE NEED FOR GREATER 
ACCESS TO RURAL AND AGRI-
CULTURAL 
MEDIA 
PROGRAM-
MING 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH (for herself, Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR, Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. MORAN, 
and Mr. DAINES) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Agriculture, Nu-
trition, and Forestry: 
S. RES. 712 
Whereas individuals living in rural areas in 
the United States need access to media con-
tent that is relevant to their daily lives; 
Whereas rural and agricultural program-
ming includes agricultural weather, agri-
business news, commodity market news, and 
western sports, and this programming is im-
portant to the farmers and ranchers of the 
United States for their way of life and mak-
ing a living; 
Whereas rural and agricultural program-
ming covers matters that affect all individ-
uals in the United States; 
Whereas all individuals in the United 
States need to be exposed to, and informed 
about, what is occurring outside of the major 
cities and suburbs of the United States; 
Whereas all individuals in the United 
States feel the effects of inflation and supply 
chain shortages, and rural and agricultural 
programming is in a unique position to in-
form viewers of the roots of these issues; 
Whereas the population of the world is pro-
jected to grow from 7,000,000,000 to approxi-
mately 9,000,000,000 by 2050, and agricultural 
productivity will need to increase to meet 
the growing demand for food and the pro-
jected increase in consumption; 
Whereas a decrease in investment in agri-
cultural research and development would re-
sult in a negative shock to agricultural pro-
ductivity; 
Whereas an informed public is key to sup-
porting the proper level of investment in ag-
ricultural research and development; 
Whereas significant consolidation in the 
media market and prioritization of consoli-
dated media has had a negative impact on

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
just had the opportunity to host a 
lunch—the Thursday lunch—for a num-
ber of my Senate colleagues. This is an 
opportunity that Senators get to essen-
tially brag about their State. It is kind 
of like what I do with the ‘‘Alaskan of 
the Week’’ speech that I give. 
I know we have new pages here. 
I am going to be putting out a 
Facebook post on the incredible bounty 
that we just had at the lunch—salmon, 
halibut, peonies flowers, which are now 
growing in abundance in Alaska. It was 
a really, really incredible meal, if I do 
say so myself, from Alaskans. So we 
are going to talk about that. 
Next week I will be back to my 
‘‘Alaskan of the Week’’ series, for the 
new pages. I promise you, this is going 
to be your favorite speech of the week 
because it is interesting, and it tells 
stories, and it is exciting about what is 
going on in Alaska. 
Madam President, I want to talk 
about two other issues today that I 
care deeply about—I think most Sen-
ators do, and certainly Americans do— 
and that is two things that our country 
desperately needs: infrastructure and 
energy. Infrastructure and energy—and 
we all know that this is what is needed. 
We talk about it here a lot in the 
Senate. However, some, especially in 
the Biden administration, talk a lot 
about these issues but, then, when it 
comes to taking action, maybe not so 
much. 
Maybe 
that 
is 
starting 
to 
change, maybe not. 
But I am going to talk about some-
thing I introduced in the Senate yes-
terday that is going to be action, espe-
cially on infrastructure. So let’s talk 
about infrastructure first. 
Yesterday, I introduced a joint reso-
lution of disapproval under the Con-
gressional Review Act—it is what we 
call the CRA—which will nullify the 
Biden administration’s new regulations 
that are remarkably going to bog down

July 14, 2022 
the ability to permit infrastructure 
projects. It is going to add to the red-
tape that every single American who 
cares about this issue knows is a prob-
lem, and it is a new reg from the Biden 
administration—remarkably, 
because 
they supposedly are for infrastructure, 
and I am going to get to that. It is a 
new reg to make it harder to build in-
frastructure projects. 
So let me unpack a little bit of that 
because it is something that I think all 
Americans care about. I know they 
care about it, but it can kind of be bor-
ing and technical, with permitting and 
things like that. 
When the National Environmental 
Policy Act, NEPA, was passed in the 
late sixties, it required an environ-
mental impact statement, an EIS, as 
we call these things. In the old days, 
you would do an EIS. It would take 
about a year, maybe. You would get 
public input. It was maybe 100 pages. 
OK? The process worked. People were 
engaged. It didn’t bog down things, and 
you would have a couple of hundred 
pages that the average American could 
read and then you would build, which 
is what we all want to do in a respon-
sible way. 
Fast forward to today. NEPA has 
been completely abused. This is a huge 
passion of mine because it hurts every-
body. Too many people, too many 
Americans now know the numbers: 4 to 
6 years on average to complete any EIS 
in America. Most cost millions of dol-
lars. Most EISes are thousands of pages 
so no one reads them. How can you 
read them? And it is undeniably killing 
our ability to build infrastructure. 
The only people, in my view, who 
really like this new system are, A, rad-
ical far-left environmental groups that 
don’t want to build anything—OK, that 
is a group; it is not a big group in 
America, but, unfortunately, they have 
a loud voice—and probably the Chinese 
Communist Party. When they know 
they have to compete against us, they 
love the fact that it takes 9 to 10 years 
to permit a bridge in the U.S.A. 
Let me provide some examples. GAO 
did a study quite a while ago on new 
highway construction to build and de-
sign a new highway, 9 to 19 years, on 
average, in America. It is about 8 
years, I think, for Federal permits to 
permit a bridge—a bridge—in America. 
The Gross Reservoir in Colorado, 
which is going to offer clean water to 
the people of that State, it has been 
two decades—20 years—to permit that 
important infrastructure project. 
The California bullet train project— 
holy cow—approved in the nineties and 
still not built. The Mountain Valley 
Pipeline in Virginia and West Virginia, 
it began in 2015 with 20 miles left to 
complete. I hate to say it. It will never 
be completed—litigation, back to the 
courts, NEPA, radical enviros stopping 
it. This is not America. This is not the 
way it should work. 
My State, unfortunately, has been 
the epicenter of groups that try to stop 
any resource development projects— 
any projects—a road, a bridge, a gold 
mine. The Kensington Mine in Alaska 
now employs over 400 people, average 
wage $110,000 per year. That is great 
money. It took almost 20 years to per-
mit if you include the litigation—20 
years. Who is that benefiting? 
I worked with the Trump administra-
tion on their NEPA Executive order. I 
worked in the Environment and Public 
Works Committee on this infrastruc-
ture bill that President Biden sup-
ported. We got good—not great—but we 
got some pretty darn good permitting 
reform, based on some of what we did 
in the Trump administration, to bring 
projects to be able to build in a timely, 
efficient manner, not cutting corners. 
There is one Federal Agency in charge 
of decision, time limits on NEPA re-
quirements to 2 years, limitations on 
pages for NEPA. These are common-
sense reforms. We got them into law. 
OK. That is pretty good. Bipartisan. 
The President hailed this as one of his 
big signature achievements. I voted for 
it, in part, because of NEPA reforms, 
because of permitting reforms. 
What am I upset about? About 4 
months ago, the Biden administra-
tion’s Council on Environmental Qual-
ity not only revised the Trump Execu-
tive order on permitting, which the av-
erage American Republican and Demo-
crat thought was good—they actually 
undertook new regulations for NEPA 
that are clearly—clearly—intended to 
make it harder to permit infrastruc-
ture projects, particularly energy in-
frastructure projects. 
Just ask anyone. Go look at the regs. 
Go look at what they put out. What I 
find remarkable is that the President 
let this come out of his White House. 
He is supposedly ‘‘Mr. Infrastructure,’’ 
‘‘Mr. Building Trades,’’ ‘‘Mr. Joe Six- 
Pack Union Guy.’’ 
This is a product of the radical, elite, 
coastal Democratic special interests 
that is going to make it harder to build 
things. That is a fact. It is a sad fact, 
especially because a lot of us came to-
gether as Democrats and Republicans 
to pass permitting reform. 
So what did I file yesterday? A Con-
gressional Review Act resolution says 
that if Congress doesn’t like a big regu-
lation coming out of the executive 
branch, we can vote to rescind it. We 
can vote to rescind it. So, yesterday, I 
filed one of those resolutions targeting 
this new rule from the Biden adminis-
tration meant to slow down the build-
ing of infrastructure. 
Here is the thing. You don’t see this 
a lot, but every single Republican Sen-
ator is a cosponsor of my resolution— 
50—50 cosponsors of our Congressional 
Review Act resolution on infrastruc-
ture. 
The other good thing about the CRA 
law, Congressional Review Act law, it 
is a privileged resolution. What does 
that mean? It means Majority Leader 
SCHUMER, even if he doesn’t like it, has 
to take it up. 
Here is the other thing. Under the 
CRA law, you only need 51 Senators 51 
Senators to make it pass the Senate. 
So my Democratic colleagues are going 
to have a tough choice here. I don’t 
think it should be tough. I think it 
should be 100 to 0. If you want infra-
structure for America and you want to 
stand with the men and women who 
build things in America, then you are 
going to vote for my resolution. Sim-
ple. 
Let me quote the Laborers’ Inter-
national, LIUNA, the biggest construc-
tion trade union in America, led by a 
great 
American, 
Terry 
O’Sullivan. 
When the Biden administration was 
putting out their NEPA rule, the labor-
ers said: What are you doing? Here is 
our statement. Here is what they 
thought about that rule: 
Once again, communities in need of vital 
infrastructure and the hard working men 
and women who build America will be wait-
ing as project details for infrastructure are 
subjected to onerous reviews [by these new 
rules]. 
That is the Laborers’. Those are the 
men and women who build America. 
Americans will continue to bear the ex-
pense of NEPA-related delays, which 
cost taxpayers millions of dollars an-
nually. 
Lengthy review processes and unpre-
dictable legal challenges which will re-
sult from these new regs will have a 
chilling impact on private investment 
and infrastructure. 
That is what the Laborers’ said. 
This is going to be an interesting 
vote because I have said this a number 
of times—I think some of my Demo-
cratic friends have gotten a little upset 
with me, but I think it is a fact; it is 
certainly a fact in Alaska—whenever 
the national Democrats have a choice 
between the radical far-left environ-
mentalists, the coastal elites, and the 
men and women who build things and 
made our country great, they always 
choose the radical environmentalists. I 
mentioned this in the Commerce Com-
mittee hearing the other day. Some of 
my colleagues got a little upset with 
me. I said: All right. Guess what I am 
going to have—a CRA. I am going to 
put it on the floor, and it is going to be 
a test vote. I know where 50 Repub-
licans stand. We are going to stand 
with the men and women who build 
stuff. If you support my CRA like the 
Laborers’ do or will, the resolution, 
you are going to support it. If you sup-
port infrastructure for America, you 
are going to support our resolution. If 
you support energy for America, you 
are going to support our resolution. If 
you support the men and women who 
actually build stuff in this country, 
good wages, you are going to support 
my resolution. If you stand with the 
coastal environmental elites who want 
to shut down this country, you will 
vote against it. 
I think it is going to be really inter-
esting to see what the men and women 
of the U.S. Senate stand for: far-left 
environmentalists who just want to 
stop anything and shut it all down or 
the men or women who build stuff?

That vote is going to come in the 
next few weeks, and I am going to be 
down here on the floor a lot talking 
about it. I hope my colleagues do the 
right thing because we all know what 
the right thing to do is: to move this 
country forward, to build on the infra-
structure bill, and to get working and 
support the men and women who do 
that hard work. 
f 
ENERGY 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to turn to energy now. You know 
the President is in Saudi Arabia. There 
is a lot of irony here, I believe, because 
his administration has clearly—clear-
ly—made it harder for Americans to 
produce American energy with Amer-
ican workers, with American infra-
structure. That is a fact. That is a fact, 
OK? I see it in Alaska every day—every 
single day. The Federal Government is 
trying to stop the production of Amer-
ican energy. 
What are we seeing? Inflation, super 
high prices at the gas pump—literally, 
everything. Senior administration offi-
cials are going to Wall Street. Senior 
administration officials who are Fed-
eral regulators for finance are all try-
ing to choke off capital to the Amer-
ican energy sector. It hurts my con-
stituents. It hurts the country. 
So the President is going to Saudi 
Arabia to beg them to produce more. 
He should send an envoy to Texas or an 
envoy to Alaska and say: Hey, how can 
we produce more here? How can we 
produce more here? I hope they are 
starting to change their tune. I hope 
they are starting to change their tune 
so that we don’t need to beg the 
Saudis, dictators like Iran and Ven-
ezuela, and all these other autocratic 
regimes in the world to produce. We 
should produce it in our country. We 
have the highest standards in the world 
by far on the environment—by far. It is 
not even close. We have high standards 
of labor in the world. 
The Biden administration, in my 
State, has been a disaster. They have 
issued 26 Executive orders or Executive 
actions solely focused on my State, 
solely focused on Alaska, none of which 
has been helpful. 
Lately—lately—there has been dis-
cussion, constructive discussion, on a 
big project in Alaska called the Willow 
Project. The Biden administration is 
showing signs that they want to sup-
port it. That would make sense. The 
country needs energy. This would be 
done in the National Petroleum Re-
serve in Alaska set aside decades ago 
by Congress for oil and gas develop-
ment—again, the highest standards in 
the world. I pitched the President on 
this project over a year ago in the Oval 
Office. By the way, it has some of the 
lowest emissions in the world of any 
big energy project. I am going to talk 
about who supports it. 
This has been in permitting for 
years. I won’t go through the timeline, 
but this project, the Willow Project, 
has been in permitting for years. We 
could start building it this winter. As a 
matter of fact, we tried to start build-
ing it last winter. 
Like I said, I pitched the President 
on this: 2,000 construction jobs; enor-
mous support from the building trades, 
labor unions; lowest greenhouse gas 
emissions for a project this type and 
size in America. And it would help us 
not have to go beg from other coun-
tries. 
But there has been a lot of press in 
the last week on the Willow Project. Of 
course, our mainstream media doesn’t 
get it. They love to tell their kind of 
slanted story on the Willow Project, so 
I am going to push back. And, boy, if 
you are a reporter, I really hope you 
write down some of the stuff that I am 
going to talk about here because it is 
all factual. And with all due respect, 
most of you guys never write about 
these things. 
I am going to start with this chart. 
This is a really important chart in my 
mind, and it is important because this 
chart goes to an issue that really, real-
ly strikes to the heart and soul of why 
resource development in my State in 
particular is so important. 
This chart is from the American 
Medical Association, and it looks at 
life expectancy from 1980 to 2014: 25 
years. And in different parts of Amer-
ica, you see different life expectancy in 
these different colors. The blue, darker 
blue-purple is areas where life expect-
ancy has increased dramatically in the 
last 25 years. 
Unfortunately, there is yellow, or-
ange, and even red. Life expectancy has 
slowed or even decreased in a few 
places. If you look at the map, that is 
mostly due to the horrendous opioid 
epidemic that we had as a nation. 
But if you look at this chart, the one 
State where life expectancy has in-
creased the most, by far, is the State of 
Alaska. The one area in the State of 
Alaska that has increased the most in 
terms of life expectancy are many of 
our rural areas: North Slope Borough, 
Northwest Arctic Borough, Aleutian Is-
land chain—13 years, 13 years. In 25 
years, people’s life expectancy went up 
that much. 
I have asked many times my Senate 
colleagues, Give me a policy indicator 
of success more important than are the 
people you representing living longer. 
Give me one. There isn’t one. That is 
about as important as it gets. 
And in my State, it has happened. It 
has happened. Why has it happened? 
Why has it happened? Well, I will tell 
you why it has happened. First, in a lot 
of these rural areas, unfortunately, the 
life expectancy in the early eighties 
was quite low. 
These are primarily Alaskan Native 
communities, and they had some of the 
lowest life expectancies of any Ameri-
cans—sometimes of any people in the 
world—because 
they 
didn’t 
have 
things, like good jobs and flush toilets 
and clinics. They lived in real poverty. 
So we started really low. 
And then what happened? What hap-
pened that in these mostly Alaskan 
Native communities people started liv-
ing longer? I will tell you what hap-
pened. They started getting jobs. Re-
source development happened, respon-
sible resource development: oil, gas, 
mining, fishing. 
So when I talk about these issues, 
when Senator MURKOWSKI talks about 
these issues, it is not just some kind of 
pie-in-the-sky issue of oil and gas. I 
mean, this is about life and death, 
which is why I come down here a little 
bit riled up sometimes because people 
don’t have a clue. People don’t have a 
clue. 
The radical enviros who try to shut 
down the economies of my State all the 
darned time and some U.S. Senators— 
primarily the senior Senator from New 
Mexico—who come down here and try 
to shut this down, they don’t under-
stand. 
So people are living longer in Alaska, 
much longer, more than any other part 
of the country because we have had re-
sponsible resource development, which 
brings me back to Willow. 
So, again, you will see all these arti-
cles in the Washington Post, all these 
stories. Heck, there is three this week, 
I think, about this one project. And 
they are all slanted. And you have got 
some Lower 48 environmental group in 
New York City or San Francisco—oh 
my gosh, climate bomb—all this rhet-
oric that is hot air—pardon the pun— 
but not accurate. Who is supporting 
this project? Who is supporting? 
You have an incredible diversity of 
people supporting this project. First, 
the unions, every major union in Amer-
ica—building trades, AFL–CIO—they 
are all supporting this project. They 
are all supporting this project. 
But what I really want to emphasize 
is another group that is very special to 
me that supports the Willow Project. 
And you see here some of the symbols 
of these groups right here. 
Some are the Alaska Chamber, Oil 
and Gas Association, Resource Devel-
opment Council, but most of these 
symbols here are the Alaskan Native 
people—the Alaskan Native people, the 
leaders of a really important constitu-
ency in Alaska, the First Peoples of 
Alaska. 
Why am I saying this? Because our 
national media never talks about this, 
right? They will pick one group, one 
leader—oh, we are against it—so they 
write about it. That is baloney. 
The leaders of the Alaska commu-
nities, the Native communities are 
overwhelmingly 
supportive 
of 
this 
project. And here is my point: This ad-
ministration loves to talk about envi-
ronmental justice, environmental eq-
uity, communities that have been dis-
criminated against to make sure they 
have access to proper environment, but 
you know what they do? They have 
been doing it for a year-and-a-half. 
When they talk about environmental 
justice, environmental equity, they al-
ways forget about Alaskan Natives.

They purposefully forget about Alas-
kan Natives. I see it all the time. 
They can’t do it this time. This 
project—and come on, media, write the 
story. This project has overwhelming 
support by the Native leaders and Na-
tive communities in Alaska. 
So if you are for environmental jus-
tice and racial equity, all the things 
that the Biden administration says 
they are for, you better be a Willow 
supporter. 
And for those in the Biden adminis-
tration, Gina McCarthy and others, 
someone should ask her, Why are you 
discriminating against Alaskan Native 
people, because that is exactly what 
you are doing. 
So you have, right here, some of our 
Alaska Native leaders in this state-
ment: 
The administration cannot proclaim to 
support meaningful tribal consultation and 
environmental justice while at the same 
time killing a critical resource [project] that 
supports . . . the Inupiat communities of the 
North Slope [region]. 
That is right there from our great 
Alaska Native leaders, the Alaska Fed-
eration of Natives. I have their letter. 
That is the group representing every 
single Alaska Native organization in 
the State, the biggest group in the 
State, 
fully 
supports 
the 
Willow 
Project. 
The ANCSA Regional Corporation 
leadership fully supports the Willow 
Project. 
The Inupiat Community of the Arctic 
Slope 
fully 
supports 
the 
Willow 
Project. 
Senator MURKOWSKI just put out a 
press release. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senator MURKOWSKI
press release be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
NEWS RELEASE, 
LISA MURKOWSKI, 
July 14, 2022. 
ALASKANS VOICE STRONG SUPPORT FOR 
WILLOW PROJECT 
WASHINGTON, DC—In case you missed it, 
U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R–AK) issued 
the following statement in strong support of 
ConocoPhillips’ Willow project, located in 
the 
National 
Petroleum 
Reserve-Alaska 
(NPR–A), after the federal Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM) published a draft Sup-
plemental Environmental Impact Statement 
for it late last week. 
‘‘From day one, I’ve elevated the Willow 
project to the Administration as my top pri-
ority, and I will continue to hold them ac-
countable to their commitment to see this 
additional environmental review through so 
that construction can begin this winter. Re-
sponsibly-developed Alaskan energy benefits 
both our national security and American 
families who are facing near-record energy 
prices,’’ said Senator Murkowski. ‘‘The Wil-
low project has gone through several ex-
traordinarily stringent environmental re-
views and will adhere to Alaska’s world-class 
safety and environmental standards. It’s no 
wonder the project has such broad support 
from Alaskans—including the Alaska Fed-
eration of Natives, the Alaska AFL-CIO, the 
Alaska Chamber of Commerce, and Alaska 
Native stakeholders across the North Slope.’’ 
Willow is critical to Alaska’s economy, 
throughput in the quarter-full Trans Alaska 
Pipeline System, domestic energy security, 
and making energy more affordable for fami-
lies and businesses. The project is estimated 
to provide up to 160,000 barrels of American 
oil per day at peak production; $10 billion in 
revenue for state, local, and federal govern-
ments during its lifespan; 2,000 construction 
jobs, and 300 permanent jobs. 
Following last week’s announcement, a 
wide array of Alaskans joined Senator Mur-
kowski in voicing their continued strong 
support for the Willow project and thanking 
her for her longstanding advocacy of it. Mur-
kowski encourages all Alaskans to weigh in, 
in favor of Willow’s final approval, through 
BLM’s 45–day public comment process. 
WHAT ALASKANS ARE SAYIN 
‘‘RDC welcomed the news of the release of 
the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) 
draft supplemental environmental impact 
statement for the Willow project,’’ said Leila 
Kimbrell, Executive Director for the Re-
source Development Council for Alaska. 
‘‘After a delay to the project because of an 
August 2021 court decision, RDC is pleased to 
see the draft SEIS released in time to keep 
a winter construction season and we thank 
Senator Murkowski for keeping pressure on 
the administration to put this project back 
on track. We know this will be a responsibly 
developed project, having already undergone 
a rigorous multiyear environmental review. 
It’s time to move forward with a responsible 
domestic energy project that will create 
thousands of jobs, generate tens of billions of 
dollars, and strengthen our energy independ-
ence.’’ 
‘‘The Willow Project is critical to the eco-
nomic well-being of our region’s eight 
In˜ upiat villages. Every delay in the project 
also delays the economic, infrastructure and 
employment benefits the project will bring 
to North Slope communities and our people. 
ASRC extends our gratitude to Senator Mur-
kowski, Senator Sullivan and the late Con-
gressman Don Young for their unwavering 
commitment to moving the Willow Project 
forward,’’ said Rex A. Rock, Sr., President 
and CEO of Arctic Slope Regional Corpora-
tion. 
‘‘Thanks to Senator Murkowski for fight-
ing for what is good for Alaska and America; 
more domestic oil in the pipeline, good jobs 
that support a family and lower fuel costs in 
our future. Once again, Lisa gets it done. 
Alaskans should be so proud of this tireless 
fighter for our state,’’ said Joelle Hall, Presi-
dent of Alaska AFL-CIO. 
‘‘ConocoPhillips and many stakeholders, 
including residents of the North Slope and 
across Alaska are committed to the Willow 
project as it will supply much needed energy 
for the United States, while serving as a 
strong example of environmentally and so-
cially responsible development that offers 
extensive public benefits. The Willow project 
has undergone an extensive and rigorous 
multi-year environmental analysis, includ-
ing extensive baseline scientific studies. The 
project will also create employment opportu-
nities for union labor and contribute local 
tax revenue that benefit communities on the 
North Slope, as well as significant state and 
federal 
tax 
revenue 
for 
many 
years. 
ConocoPhillips thanks the Alaska Congres-
sional Delegation—Senators Murkowski and 
Sullivan, and the late Congressman Young— 
for their tremendous efforts in advocating 
for the Willow project,’’ said Erec Isaacson, 
President of ConocoPhillips Alaska. 
‘‘Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope 
supports the development of the Willow 
Project. Responsible development for our re-
gion will provide infrastructure, jobs and 
economic growth for our tribal members. 
ICAS is pleased with the environmental re-
views that took place to ensure safe develop-
ment,’’ said Morrie Lemen, Jr., Executive 
Director of the Inupiat Community of The 
Arctic Slope. 
‘‘The desperate need for the Willow project 
could not come at a more critical juncture in 
time. Alaskans and Americans across the 
country are paying record high energy 
prices, while the more than 20 year struggle 
to get the Willow project developed serves as 
a chilling reminder that what stands be-
tween Americans and lower energy prices is 
nothing but bureaucratic red tape. Mean-
while, this vital project that can drive en-
ergy abundance, is tucked away in the NPR– 
A because government can’t get out of the 
way. We appreciate Senator Murkowski’s te-
nacity on this issue and we look forward to 
working with her to rollback despotic envi-
ronmental 
regulations,’’ 
said 
Bernadette 
Wilson, State Director of Americans for 
Prosperity Alaska. 
‘‘Energy security is vital to our country. 
Alaska has a critical role and ability to pro-
vide needed energy. Among the whole array 
of energy options, the Willow project can be 
a shining example of success,’’ said Julie 
Kitka, President of the Alaska Federation of 
Natives. 
‘‘The release of the draft environmental re-
view for the Willow project comes at a crit-
ical time for Alaska and the nation. Along 
with the majority of Alaskans, the Alaska 
Chamber is a steadfast supporter of respon-
sible development projects that provide jobs, 
economic opportunity, and increased rev-
enue to state, local, and federal govern-
ments. Now, more than ever, the United 
States needs to increase domestic energy 
supply and enact and defend sound policy 
that encourages development of our natural 
resources at home. The Chamber thanks Sen-
ators Murkowski and Sullivan for their per-
sistence in keeping the Willow project at the 
forefront of the discussion with the Biden 
Administration and ensuring the project re-
ceives due process,’’ said Kati Capozzi, Presi-
dent and CEO of the Alaska Chamber of 
Commerce. 
‘‘Through the North Slope Borough per-
mitting process we exercise zoning and other 
oversight that has—in partnership with the 
State and Fed’s—led to some of the strictest 
environmental regulations in our nation and 
one of the best examples of responsible de-
velopment in the world. Senator Murkowski 
knows this and was a champion for our re-
gion on endeavors like the Willow project. 
Willow will not only lead to jobs, but better 
schools, health clinics, and transportation 
infrastructure and we can’t thank the Sen-
ator enough for continuing to fight for the 
region and the State,’’ said D.J. Fauske, Di-
rector of Government and External Affairs 
for the North Slope Borough. 
‘‘It is encouraging to see the Bureau of 
Land Management release the revised draft 
environmental review of ConocoPhillips’ pro-
posed Willow Master Development Plan in 
the National Petroleum Reserve, or NPR–A. 
AOGA and its allies will be fully engaged in 
the public meetings to come, and we encour-
age all Alaskans to learn more about the 
project’s benefits and participate as the 
process moves forward. Willow represents a 
near-term opportunity to help return the 
United States to energy independence at a 
time when our country desperately needs 
more domestic sources of oil and gas. Of 
course, a project the size of Willow will also 
boost Alaska’s economy, creating job oppor-
tunities and providing tax revenues to state, 
local, and federal governments. Alaskans 
have long supported development of our oil 
and gas resources. Now is the time to speak 
up and let the federal government know how 
those of us who call Alaska home feel about

projects like Willow: no one cares more 
about protecting our environment or safely 
developing Alaska’s resources than Alas-
kans. Alaskans who want to be a part of this 
significant step forward have a 45–day com-
ment period to make their voices heard,’’ 
said Kara Moriarty, President and CEO of 
the Alaska Oil and Gas Association. 
‘‘The Willow project represents a valid 
compliment to rising energy needs while 
contributing to the health, well-being, secu-
rity and self-determination of the region, 
state and country. Regulatory process would 
be better served by more effective implemen-
tation of process and less evaluation by po-
litical trends,’’ said Douglas Whiteman, 
Mayor of the City of Atqasuk on the North 
Slope. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
Alaskans Voice Strong Support for the 
Willow Project. She has a huge list of 
Alaskan Native groups and others who 
are supporting the Willow Project. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
AFN letter be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
ALASKA FEDERATION OF NATIVES, 
February 23, 2022. 
Re AFN Continued Support for the Willow 
Project. 
Hon. DEBRA HAALAND, 
Department of the Interior. 
DEAR SECRETARY HAALAND: On behalf of 
the Co-Chairs and Board of Directors of the 
Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN), I write 
to share our long-standing support for the 
Alaska Willow Project in the National Petro-
leum Reserve Alaska (NPR–A). 
The Willow Project has undergone strin-
gent environmental permitting and a vig-
orous community engagement process. It 
was planned based on the requirements of 
the 2013 NPR–A Integrated Activity Plan 
under the Obama-Biden Administration and 
Secretary Salazar with the highest standards 
for environmental stewardship. The permit-
ting and environmental review process en-
compassed a period of well over two years 
and included multiple rounds of public com-
ment and public meetings with Alaska Na-
tive stakeholders. AFN appreciates the out-
reach 
and 
communication 
between 
ConocoPhillips and the Alaska Native com-
munity and considers the process a model for 
other development initiatives. 
AFN understands that the need for a 
proactive whole of government approach to 
deal with climate change; however fossil 
fuels will be with us for quite some time to 
come, and projects like Willow can help 
bridge the gap. As such, delaying Willow any 
further will only hinder Alaska’s economic 
recovery. 
The 
Willow 
Project 
could 
jumpstart our economy with thousands of 
jobs and be a model in community and envi-
ronmental stewardship for future opportuni-
ties. 
Additionally, the international crisis in 
Ukraine highlights the Willow Project’s im-
portance to our national security. The loom-
ing invasion of Ukraine by Russia is already 
stressing global energy markets. The Willow 
Project is a critical opportunity for the U.S. 
to expand domestic energy supplies and secu-
rity while creating economic opportunities 
to help Alaska recover from the pandemic. 
As such, I strongly urge you to support the 
current record of decision and allow the Wil-
low Project to move forward as planned and 
previously approved. 
Thank you for your consideration. If you 
have questions, please feel free to contact 
me. 
Sincerely, 
JULIE KITKA, 
President. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
the 
ANCSA Regional Association letter be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
FEBRUARY 4, 2021. 
Hon. DEB HAALAND, 
Secretary Nominee, Department of the Interior, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SECRETARY NOMINEE HAALAND: The 
ANCSA Regional Association (ARA) rep-
resents the twelve Regional Corporations 
created under the Alaska Native Claims Set-
tlement Act (ANCSA) which was approved by 
Congress and signed into law by President 
Nixon in 1971. The Alaska Native Village 
Corporation Association (ANVCA) represents 
177 village and urban corporations created by 
ANCSA. Together these organizations rep-
resent over 150,000 Alaska Native share-
holders. 
We write today to urge the Department of 
Interior not to delay the ConocoPhillips 
Alaska Willow Project given the exhaustive 
and thorough review process it has already 
undergone, and the urgent need for vetted, 
economic opportunities for safe development 
in Alaska. 
ARA and ANVCA strongly support respon-
sible resource development in Alaska and are 
concerned about reports that the DOI in-
tends to, once again, review the EIS Record 
of Decision (ROD) for Willow, which could 
delay or defer the project’s progress. 
There is no basis for further review of the 
ROD, given the extensive record of public 
hearings, documented BLM efforts to address 
all issues raised through public comment, 
completion of an in-depth environmental 
analysis, and the over 270 stipulations and 
best management practices the project will 
be required to follow. The Willow EIS was 
performed under the rigorous process in 
place during the Obama Administration, and 
was not expedited or granted any special 
consideration. The EIS took more than two 
years to complete and the report itself totals 
more than 2,600 pages of in-depth analysis. 
Given the extensive nature of the process 
used to perform the Willow EIS, we request 
that the Department of Interior not delay 
the Willow project for further unnecessary 
analysis, or political rhetoric. 
The State of Alaska has been in recession 
for over five years, well before the COVID 
pandemic hit, which then caused further neg-
ative impacts in every industry important to 
our state. The federal government should be 
looking at opportunities to help Alaska re-
spond to these impacts rather than exacer-
bating them. Delaying a project like Willow, 
which has already passed a rigorous EIS 
process, will cause ripple effects throughout 
the Alaskan economy. This project will sup-
port over 2,000 construction jobs and hun-
dreds of long-term jobs, while providing over 
$2 billion in revenues to the State of Alaska 
and $7.6 billion in federal royalties. For con-
text, $2 billion is roughly the size of the cur-
rent budget deficit faced by our state. Reve-
nues received by this project allows our rural 
communities to receive continued support to 
schools, health clinics and basic public serv-
ices like water and sewer treatments. 
The Willow Project has passed every envi-
ronmental and community test put before it 
and would provide a much-needed economic 
boost to Alaska. Delaying it any further will 
only bring more harm to our state. It also 
harms the economy and budget of the North 
Slope Borough, the local government most 
closely impacted by the federal govern-
ment’s decision for review. 
Best Regards, 
KIM REITMEIER, 
Executive 
Director, 
ARA. 
HALLIE BISSETT, 
Executive 
Director,

Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the ICAS 
Community of the Arctic Slope be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
January 26, 2022. 
Hon. RAU´ L GRIJALVA, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA: It has come to our at-
tention that you are considering sending a 
letter to Secretary of the Interior Deb 
Haaland opposing the Willow Project, a 
project located in our region of Alaska. In 
your position as Chairman of the House Nat-
ural Resources Committee, a committee that 
has jurisdiction on issues related to the In-
digenous Peoples of the United States, we re-
spectfully request that you meet with and 
listen to the indigenous people of the North 
Slope of Alaska before you take a position 
on the Willow Project. 
The In˜ upiat of the North Slope have lived 
in the Arctic for over 10,000 years. We are 
proud of our self-determination efforts to en-
sure future generations of In˜ upiat continue 
to reside in our communities and have access 
to essential services. Without a stable econ-
omy, our communities will suffer and so too 
will our ability to engage in In˜ upiat cultural 
traditions, including a subsistence way of 
life. 
The North Slope of Alaska spans an area 
nearly the size of the state of Minnesota and 
within that expansive area, there are eight 
In˜ upiat 
communities—Anaktuvuk 
Pass, 
Atqasuk, Kaktovik, Nuiqsut, Point Hope, 
Point Lay, Utqiag˙vik and Wainwright. None 
of our communities are accessible by road; 
all supplies must be flown or barged in mak-
ing the cost of living extremely high, and 
economic opportunity generally low. Our 
North Slope residents are keenly aware that 
advances 
in 
our 
communities—running 
water, local schools, health care, public safe-
ty, electricity, and more have come as a re-
sult of the coordination and cooperation of 
Alaska Native leaders and entities across the 
region. 
As you know, fifty years ago, the Federal 
Government directed Alaska Native people 
to organize in a new structure of indigenous 
representation. The Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act of 1971, commonly referred 
to as ANCSA, was a dramatically different 
approach by the Federal Government to Fed-
eral Indian policy Unlike the Lower 48 model 
of indigenous representation that typically 
has a central entity on the reservation, the 
Tribe, that administers the delivery of serv-
ices like healthcare, public safety, edu-
cation, land management and economic de-
velopment to name a few, the passage of 
ANCSA created a fragmented system of Alas-
ka Native representation and delivery of 
services. 
Our region has a multitude of Alaska Na-
tive entities that work together to effec-
tively serve, provide for and enrich the lives 
of the In˜ upiat people we represent. Our three 
entities, the In˜ upiat Community of the Arc-
tic Slope (ICAS), the North Slope Borough

(Borough) and Arctic Slope Regional Cor-
poration (ASRC) are three of those entities. 
While our roles are defined, our constitu-
encies overlap which is why we work closely 
together to protect the cultural and eco-
nomic interests of the North Slope In˜ upiat. 
Established in 1971, the In˜ upiat Commu-
nity of the Arctic Slope is a federally recog-
nized regional tribal government for the 
North Slope and represents over 13,000 
In˜ upiat tribal members. The mission of ICAS 
is to exercise its sovereign rights and powers 
for the benefit of tribal members, to con-
serve and retain tribal lands and resources 
including subsistence and environmental 
issues, to establish and carry out justice sys-
tems including social services under In˜ upiat 
tribal law and custom, and to increase the 
variety and quality of services provided to 
current tribal members and for our future 
generations. 
The North Slope Borough is a home rule 
government located above the Arctic Circle 
that represents the roughly 10,000 residents 
in the eight communities of the region. The 
Borough’s jurisdiction includes the entire 
National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska (NPR– 
A) and the villages within it—Nuiqsut, 
Atqasuk, Utqiag˙vik, and Wainwright. In 1972, 
the In˜ upiat people of the North Slope formed 
the Borough to ensure our communities 
would benefit from oil and gas development 
on their ancestral homelands. It was the 
first time Native Americans took control of 
their destiny through the use of a municipal 
government. The Borough exercises its pow-
ers of taxation, property assessment, edu-
cation, and planning and zoning services. 
Taxes levied on oil and gas infrastructure 
have enabled the Borough to invest in public 
infrastructure and utilities, support edu-
cation, and provide police, fire, emergency 
and other services. Elsewhere in rural Alas-
ka, these services are typically provided by 
the state or federal governments. 
Arctic Slope Regional Corporation was in-
corporated 
pursuant 
to 
the 
passage 
of 
ANCSA. ASRC is owned by and represents 
the business interests of our approximately 
13,000 In˜ upiat shareholders, many of whom 
reside in the eight communities on the North 
Slope. ANCSA extinguished aboriginal land 
title and conveyed nearly five million acres 
of fee-simple land to ASRC for the cultural 
and economic benefit of our In˜ upiat share-
holders. Mandated by Congress to not only 
operate as a for-profit corporation but to 
serve the social and welfare interests of the 
people it represents, ASRC is committed to 
providing financial returns to our In˜ upiat 
shareholders in the form of jobs and divi-
dends, and to preserving In˜ upiat culture and 
traditions. 
Over the decades, and even more so today, 
we have seen national environmental non-
governmental 
organizations 
(ENGOs) 
at-
tempt to wear the mantle of protectors of In-
digenous interests in the U.S. Arctic—some-
thing that we, as elected and appointed lead-
ers of the In˜ upiat people of the North Slope, 
find unacceptable. ENGO’s continue to push 
a false narrative to advance their agendas at 
the expense of the Indigenous people and 
communities of the North Slope. 
To fully embrace the Biden Administra-
tion’s priorities of racial equity, environ-
mental justice and supporting underserved 
communities, leaders must take the time to 
listen to those they are aiming to serve, even 
if their perspective may not fit the political 
narrative being pushed on a national level. 
We understand that your proposed letter 
not only requests Secretary Haaland oppose 
the Willow Project, but it calls for termi-
nating the project in order to protect the re-
sources that support Indigenous commu-
nities. The Administration cannot proclaim 
to support meaningful tribal consultation 
and environmental justice while at the same 
time killing a critical resource that supports 
our regional economy and the In˜ upiat com-
munities of the North Slope region. If the 
contents of your proposed letter are true, 
this would be highly offensive to our region’s 
leadership. 
ICAS, the Borough and ASRC support the 
development of the Willow Project. Our re-
gion has a fifty-year relationship with the 
oil and gas industry, which came as a result 
of the Federal Government’s desire to de-
velop oil and gas resources on our ancestral 
homelands. While initially wary of any de-
velopment on our lands, through open com-
munication and transparency in planning 
and In˜ upiat ingenuity, our relationship with 
the oil and gas industry has turned into a 
partnership. A partnership that has brought 
significant economic benefits to the region 
that would have otherwise been absent. The 
entities that represent the North Slope 
In˜ upiat play an active role in oil and gas de-
velopment projects that take place in our re-
gion. Our region has shown that responsible 
development and the continuation of our 
In˜ upiat cultural traditions, including sub-
sistence activities, can effectively coexist 
while also providing the means to deliver 
modern-day essential services such as police 
and fire protection, pre-K–12 education and 
water and sewer infrastructure (which again, 
are largely made possible through respon-
sible development of oil and gas resources on 
our lands). 
If you are truly concerned about curbing 
oil and gas development, examine the mas-
sive imports of Russian oil coming into the 
West Coast of the United States and also ask 
why the Biden Administration has recently 
called for OPEC to produce more overseas 
developed oil to stave off Russian aggression 
in Ukraine. None of these countries have the 
same stringent rules and regulations im-
posed on oil and gas companies that operate 
in the U.S., including in our region of Alas-
ka. The North Slope region has developed 
our oil and gas resources safely and for the 
direct benefit of our In˜ upiat community and 
the nation. 
We would be grateful and honored to have 
the opportunity to meet with you on this 
topic and ask that you consider meeting 
with us before sending a letter that does not 
align with the interests of the In˜ upiat of the 
North Slope of Alaska. 
If there are any questions we can answer 
for you or your staff, or to schedule a time 
to meet please contact Bridget Anderson, 
ASRC’s Vice President External Affairs. 
Sincerely, 
GEORGE EDWARDSON, 
President, 
In˜ upiat Community of 
the Arctic Slope. 
HARRY K. BROWER, Jr., 
Mayor, 
North Slope Borough. 
REX A. ROCK. Sr., 
President and CEO, 
Arctic Slope Regional 
Corporation. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, so 
here is my point: The next time the 
media writes a big story on Willow and 
environmental justice and racial eq-
uity—which they love to do—and Alas-
ka, they need to include this. This is 
the truth. They need to include the 
strong union support. 
Go talk to the laborers, go talk to 
the building trades, go talk to Sean 
McGarvey, Terry O’Sullivan. See what 
they think about Willow. 
There is one group that doesn’t like 
Willow. It is the same group that 
doesn’t like anything in America. It is 
the 
radical 
far-left 
environmental 
groups that are trying to shut down my 
State and keep Native Americans, Na-
tive Alaskans, impoverished in Alaska. 
I am not going to let that happen. 
Here is one final thing. It is funny, 
not 
funny—Amusing, 
not 
amusing. 
Again, this is really important. This is 
about life and death. 
You have all these stories about Wil-
low in the national media, but what 
really, really kind of burns me up is 
there is a story—you know, they talk 
about the climate bomb, whatever the 
heck that means; it is not factual. But 
the one story I never see about Federal 
lands—real big increases in oil and gas 
production, real big increases in emis-
sions—that never gets written about, 
again for our friends in the media— 
never—is what is going on in New Mex-
ico, what is going on in New Mexico. 
Well, we know some of the Members, 
the senior Senator from New Mexico, 
he loves to come after Alaska projects; 
I don’t know why. Shut them down. 
Maybe to divert the media’s attention 
from what is going on in his State. But 
I just want to give a couple stats. 
Since 2019, New Mexico has increased 
production in its oil production by 
700,000 barrels a day. It is pretty im-
pressive. They were at 800,000 barrels; 
they have increased by almost 700,000. 
They have increased more than Alaska 
even produces in 3 years. 
It is now the second largest oil pro-
ducer in the country. The senior Sen-
ator from New Mexico recently bragged 
that is up 400 percent. OK. Good for 
him. 
It is still amazing to me; he comes 
down here a lot, writes letters to try to 
shut down my State. But, whatever, I 
don’t go after New Mexico. But I do 
want our friends in the media to just 
kind of ask the questions. Boy, oh, boy, 
you want to talk about climate bomb: 
700,000 barrels a day. They have more 
carbon emissions than Alaska by far. 
Nobody is writing that story. But it is 
also how we do our environmental 
standards in different States. My State 
has the highest standards in the world 
on energy production—New Mexico, 
not so much. 
Let me just give you a couple of ex-
amples: The average well in Alaska is 
28,000 barrels a day because it is con-
ventional. We are actually—the re-
source is so rich there, we are not 
fracking like they do in the unconven-
tional area. The average well in New 
Mexico produces 100 barrels—a hundred 
barrels to 28,000. So what does that 
mean? You have to drill 280 wells in 
New Mexico just to reach the equiva-
lent of one in Alaska. 
So the environmental footprint is 
much bigger. The carbon emission is 
much bigger. New Mexico flares its gas. 
We reinject our gas—again, highest en-
vironmental standards in the world. 
We conduct our exploration and drill-
ing activities only in the winter. You 
have to build ice roads, ice pads. Zero 
impact. I used to be in charge of this.

S3318 
July 14, 2022 
It is very expensive to do that. One 
little drop of anything—chewing to-
bacco—on the tundra, you have to re-
port it. So where is the story about 
what is going on there? 
Where is the carbon bomb story on 
New Mexico? Where is the story that 
the Secretary of the Interior has di-
rected almost half the Federal permits 
to drill in the country to one State? Do 
you think it is Alaska? No way. They 
are trying to shut us down. 
You think it is Texas? Nope. North 
Dakota? Nope. It is New Mexico. Golly 
gee, isn’t that interesting? 
I sure hope—look, it is terribly sus-
picious from my perspective that one 
State has received more Federal en-
ergy permits in the last 15 months than 
all other States in America combined. 
The Secretary of the Interior is from 
New Mexico. OK. Maybe there is some-
thing there. 
But here is the bottom line: There 
have been barrels of ink spilled on 
every single project in Alaska—Willow, 
this week. But reporters shrug their 
shoulders, look the other way. Maybe 
it is because it is a blue State, they 
don’t want to touch those guys, when 
it comes to New Mexico. No wonder 
Americans don’t trust the media. 
I am going to conclude with this 
quote. It is from a Wall Street Journal 
editorial written by the North Slope 
Borough mayor, Harry Brower, the 
In˜ upiat leader of the North Slope com-
munity and Josiah Paktotak, who is 
the State rep. These are two Alaska 
Native leaders elected. They are fully 
supportive of Willow. 
It was in the Wall Street Journal, en-
titled ‘‘Let Alaska Sell American En-
ergy to the World,’’ and it was written 
in March, as Russia was invading 
Ukraine. 
They said: 
Even as Russian tanks lined up on the 
Ukrainian border in February, the Biden ad-
ministration froze U.S. drilling on Federal 
lands and issued rules making it harder to 
build natural gas pipelines. 
By the way, that is the rule that I am 
putting forth a CRA resolution to re-
scind. 
They continue: 
We may be Inupiaq Eskimos 5,000 miles 
away from the Washington policy machine, 
but we know crazy when we see it. And this 
is crazy. 
And the American people know it. 
Now, look, the President is in the 
Middle East, meeting with allies, ask-
ing for the Saudis to produce more oil. 
But as he would say: Come on, man. 
You got to start at home. You got to 
start at home. 
The Willow Project in Alaska, sup-
ported by the Native community, sup-
ported by the unions—I would guar-
antee supported by probably 90 percent 
of Americans—it is time to get things 
like this done. 
So our NEPA Congressional Review 
Act and our advocacy for commonsense 
projects, like Willow, supported by 
every single group in my State—and I 
sure hope the media writes about this— 
especially the Native people—if they 
shut this down, that will be the ulti-
mate injustice to indigenous people in 
Alaska, and they know it. And that is 
one of the many reasons why they 
shouldn’t do it. 
I yield the floor.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of our amendment, Lee/Meijer 
number three eight seven, to express the 
sense of Congress that Authorizations for the 
Use of Military Force should include sunset 
provisions. 
I want to thank my cosponsors, including 
Congressman MEIJER, and Chairmen SMITH 
and MCGOVERN for their support to permit me 
to offer this amendment. 
Under our Constitution, Congress has the 
unique responsibility of oversight authority 
over the use of military force. Congress should 
maintain authority over when and how the 
United States wages war. And we should in-
sist that the executive branch have a clear 
plan, objective and time limit for these author-
izations. 
The purpose of a sunset clause is not to 
withdraw our military before it has achieved its 
goal. Rather, it is to make sure that Congress, 
as the people’s elected representatives, exer-
cises our responsibility to ensure any use of 
military force is supported by and serves the 
interests of the American people. 
Legal experts from across the ideological 
spectrum support the inclusion of sunset provi-
sions in AUMFs. And Congressionally-required 
sunsets are not a new idea. Congress has in-
cluded sunset provisions in 29 percent of prior 
authorizations for use of military force and 
declarations of war. 
A sunset is not any sign of lack of American 
resolve. Congress has shown it can and will 
act quickly and decisively when core American 
interests and values are at stake. In 1941 and 
again in 2001, Congress acted within twenty- 
four hours of the President’s request for au-
thority to wage war. 
I include in the Record an article written by 
Dr. Tess Bridgeman regarding the importance 
of AUMF sunset provisions. Dr. Bridgeman is 
a former legal advisor to the White House and 
State Department, and an expert on the con-
stitutional law regarding war powers. Dr. 
Bridgeman writes: 
‘‘Arguably far more important than any po-
tential signal that might be sent to a foreign 
adversary, 
a 
reauthorization 
requirement 
sends a very real and important signal to our 
own troops: Congress supports the war effort 
you are engaged in and has taken a tough 
vote to authorize it. And if you are brave 
enough to fight, we are brave enough to vote.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this amendment is a rea-
sonable expression of Congress’ role and the 
founders’ intent on matters of war and peace. 
We cannot write blank checks to the executive 
branch. Requiring AUMFs to include sunsets 
ensures that any use of war powers is in line 
with the views and priorities of the American 
people, expressed through the ballot box. I 
urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment, and support the principle that wars must 
have an end. 
[From Just Security, July 13, 2022] 
IN SUPPORT OF SUNSETS: EASY YES VOTES ON 
AUMF REFORM 
(By Tess Bridgeman) 
As Congress readies for votes on the must- 
pass National Defense Authorization Act 
(NDAA), several amendments related to au-
thorizations 
for 
use 
of 
military 
force 
(AUMFs) merit attention as easy ‘‘yes’’ 
votes that could help restore Congress’ con-
gressional authority over when to take the 
nation to war. Three of these are simply 
long-overdue good war powers hygiene, re-
pealing old ‘‘zombie’’ AUMFs (as Rep. Peter 
Meijer (R–MI) has coined them) that are not 
relied on for any current U.S. operations but 
could be susceptible to abuse. These are Rep. 
Barbara Lee’s (D–CA) 2002 AUMF repeal 
amendment (with bipartisan co-sponsors), 
Rep. Abigail Spanberger’s (D–VA) repeal of 
the 1991 AUMF, and Rep. Meijer’s repeal of 
the 1957 AUMF. Another bipartisan amend-
ment, co-sponsored by Reps. Lee and Meijer, 
takes the small but important step of declar-
ing the ‘‘sense of Congress’’ that any new 
AUMF should include a date on which the 
authorization is terminated unless reauthor-
ized by Congress, a.k.a. a sunset. 
While settling on the details of any new 
AUMF will be challenging, the bipartisan 
sunset amendment should be another easy 
yes vote for members, and the Biden admin-
istration should support it. The full text of 
the sense of Congress provisions are as fol-
lows: 
(1) the inclusion of a sunset provision or 
reauthorization requirement in authoriza-
tions for use of military force is critical to 
ensuring Congress’s exercise of its constitu-
tional duty to declare war; and 
(2) any joint resolution enacted to author-
ize the introduction of United States forces 
into hostilities or into situations where 
there is a serious risk of hostilities should 
include a sunset provision setting forth a 
date certain for the termination of the au-
thorization for the use of such forces absent 
the enactment of a subsequent specific statu-
tory authorization for such use of the United 
States forces. 
Making good on this sense of Congress in 
any future AUMF would go a long way to-
ward fixing a pernicious problem that has de-
veloped over the past few decades, as old 
AUMFs have been construed to authorize 
wars against enemies that did not exist at 
the time of their enactment and about which 
Congress never deliberated. A sunset clause 
guards against that kind of misuse and 
abuse. It should not be understood as an ‘‘off 
switch,’’ but rather as a vote forcing mecha-
nism. By shifting the default away from for-
ever authorizations, it ensures that the peo-
ples’ representatives affirmatively debate 
and decide whether the United States should 
be at war, and against whom, as the Con-
stitution intended. And it ensures that our 
troops doing the fighting are foregrounded in 
these deliberations. 
WHO SUPPORTS SUNSETS? 
First and foremost, Congress itself has sup-
ported sunsets by enacting them into law in 
roughly one-third of past AUMFs and dec-
larations of war. Recent serious proposals for 
new AUMFs have also included sunsets, in-
cluding those supported, and authored, by 
the executive branch: the ISIL-specific draft 
AUMF President Obama sent to Congress in 
2015 included a three-year sunset clause. 
Second, former senior officials serving in 
administrations of both political parties sup-
port sunsets. In May 2017, former CIA and 
Department of Defense General Counsel Ste-
phen Preston advocated that a sunset clause 
shows the United States is ‘‘committed to 
the fight’’ and ‘‘committed to our demo-
cratic institutions.’’ On this score, Heather 
Brandon-Smith’s overview of exchanges on 
the value of a sunset provision in a July 2017 
House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing ti-
tled ‘‘Authorization for the Use of Force and 
Current Terrorist Threats’’ is worth quoting 
in full: 
The 
witnesses 
were 
repeatedly 
asked 
whether a sunset provision should be in-
cluded in a new AUMF, with many members 
of Congress—on both sides of the aisle— 
agreeing on the merits of including a sunset. 
Both [former Attorney General Michael] 
Mukasey and [former National Counterter-
rorism Center Director Matthew] Olsen advo-
cated in favor of sunsets . . . ‘‘As experts 
across the political spectrum have ex-
plained,’’ said Olsen, ‘‘a sunset does not end 
the war. Rather, a sunset signals to our part-
ners and adversaries that the U.S. is com-
mitted to using the force required to combat 
the current threats we face, even as we sus-
tain the fight for as long as it takes.’’ 
Mukasey, who noted in his written state-
ment that he does not generally favor sun-
sets in the intelligence gathering or counter-
terrorism authorities, advocated for a sunset 
in a new AUMF. ‘‘I favor a sunset provision,’’ 
he said. ‘‘I’ve favored reconsidering the [2001] 
AUMF for years.’’ 
More recently, in March 2021, former Re-
publican 
and 
Democratic 
administration 
senior lawyers at a House Rules Committee 
hearing on war powers (in which I testified), 
agreed on the need to include sunset provi-
sions in future AUMFs. (Ryan Goodman, 
Steve Pomper, Steve Vladeck and I also sup-
ported including a three-year sunset in our 
set of principles for any new AUMF in 2021). 
Third, leading experts and former senior 
officials who have considered how new 
AUMFs should be structured have long en-
dorsed inclusion of sunsets. A set of prin-
ciples for a new AUMF from leading legal ex-
perts Rosa Brooks, Sarah Cleveland, Jen 
Daskal, Walter Dellinger, Ryan Goodman, 
Harold Hongju Koh, Marty Lederman, and 
Steve Vladeck published in Just Security in 
November 2014 endorsed a sunset. They ex-
plained that sunsets, along with other con-
straints in the proposal, avoid unnecessary 
wars 
and 
promote 
democratic 
account-
ability. Eight years later, these are even 
more imperative goals. 
Another set of principles for a new AUMF 
from Ben Wittes, Bobby Chesney, Jack Gold-
smith, and Matt Waxman at Lawfare, coinci-
dentally released on the same day in Nov. 
2014, explicitly endorsed a three-year sunset 
to ‘‘forc[e] Congress to make an affirmative 
decision as to whether, and how, it wants its 
blessing to continue.’’ Indeed, inclusion of a 
sunset is seen as a key point of consensus 
among these leading proposals for any new 
AUMF.

July 14, 2022 
BUT WOULD A SUNSET HELP THE ENEMY OR 
HAMSTRING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH? 
At a House Foreign Affairs Committee 
hearing last March, an administration wit-
ness surprisingly did not support the inclu-
sion of sunsets in AUMFs because ‘‘we do not 
want to say to our adversaries at some date 
if they just hold out they can do whatever 
they please.’’ The Biden administration 
should shift that position—and embrace 
Reps. Lee and Meijer’s amendment—for at 
least three reasons. 
First, there’s simply no reason to believe a 
congressional reauthorization requirement, 
or sunset, would send such a signal to an ad-
versary. It is doubtful that adversaries in 
foreign countries—often primarily engaged 
against non-U.S. enemies—are at all con-
cerned with U.S. domestic law authoriza-
tions. But even if we were to try to glean ex-
ternal signals from a domestic reauthoriza-
tion requirement, as former State Depart-
ment Legal Adviser Harold Hongju Koh said 
in 2015, ‘‘a sunset is not a repeal; it need not 
even be read as a proposal to repeal in the fu-
ture. . . . A sunset is simply a shared con-
gressional-executive agreement to reassess 
the situation together as a nation.’’ 
If anything, a reauthorization requirement 
shows that Congress is paying attention to 
the war it has authorized and will continue 
to do so. And notwithstanding legitimate 
concerns of partisan Capitol Hill gridlock, 
Congress manages to pass NDAAs, budgets, 
and other high-stakes legislation when need-
ed. 
Second, U.S. political leaders and the na-
tional security institutions that support 
them make decisions about the scale of U.S. 
involvement within and outside of conflict 
zones based on a range of factors, including 
the severity and immediacy of the threat, re-
source constraints, and the willingness and 
reliability of partners on the ground to act. 
A brief look at the past three presidential 
administrations underscores this point: it 
was not the expiration of an AUMF that 
caused President Biden to withdraw U.S. 
forces from Afghanistan, Trump to announce 
withdrawal from Syria (before reversing 
course), or Obama to withdraw from Presi-
dent George W. Bush’s war in Iraq. 
It bears emphasizing here that in any true 
emergency situation, under threat of an im-
minent armed attack or in a situation where 
U.S. nationals are in imminent peril abroad, 
the president may rely on independent au-
thority in Art. II of the Constitution to act 
quickly (as most presidents in our recent 
history have done), regardless of the exist-
ence of any congressional authorization. 
Third, and arguably far more important 
than any potential signal that might be sent 
to a foreign adversary, a reauthorization re-
quirement sends a very real and important 
signal to our own troops: Congress supports 
the war effort you are engaged in and has 
taken a tough vote to authorize it. And if 
you are brave enough to fight, we are brave 
enough to vote. 
A reauthorization requirement also sig-
nals—both internally and externally—a com-
mitment to our own democratic processes. 
That commitment is now more important 
than ever for members of Congress and the 
executive branch to embrace. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to several provisions in-
cluded in this year’s National Defense Author-
ization Act (NDAA) Reauthorization, although 
ultimately, I will vote in favor for final passage 
of the bill. 
First, I oppose Amendment 640, considered 
on the floor as part of en bloc Amendment 5, 
which directs the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) to reclassify public safety tele-
communications officers, also called 911 dis-
patchers, as a protective service occupation in 
the U.S. Government’s Standard Occupational 
Classification (SOC) system. This Amendment 
would have no direct effect on these workers’ 
wages, benefits, or other resources; pro-
ponents of this reclassification have stated 
that it ‘‘would provide validation.’’ 
The SOC classification system is a federal 
statistical standard used across agencies in 
data collection. According to OMB, ‘‘[t]he-SOC 
is designed exclusively for statistical pur-
poses.’’ Changes to the codes affect multiple 
data sources frequently used by policymakers, 
researchers, and employers, including the 
American Community Survey, the nation’s 
largest household survey; the Current Popu-
lation Survey (CPS), the key source of our 
monthly employment numbers; and the Occu-
pational Employment Statistics (OES), the au-
thoritative source of employment and wage in-
formation by occupation. These changes 
would undermine the intent and legitimacy of 
the SOC by deviating from the long-estab-
lished process designed to ensure the objec-
tivity and integrity statistical data classifica-
tions more broadly. 
A standing committee at OMB, the SOC 
Policy Committee (SOCPC), is responsible for 
maintaining the accuracy of these codes using 
well-defined principles. The SOCPC under-
takes a routine revision of the codes roughly 
once per decade; the process spans multiple 
years and ‘‘involves extensive background re-
search, periods or public comment, review of 
comments, and implementation of revisions.’’ 
During its latest revision, which began in early 
2012 and was finalized in 2018, OMB specifi-
cally rejected comments requesting it reclas-
sify 911 dispatchers as directed in Amend-
ment 640. In response to public comments 
presented in the May 2014 Federal Register, 
the Obama Administration’s OMB explained it 
‘‘did not accept these recommendations based 
on Classification Principle 2, which states that 
workers are coded according to the work per-
formed. The work performed is that of a dis-
patcher, not a first responder.’’ 
In 2016, OMB declined a similar request for 
reclassification. 
Based 
on 
the 
principles 
OMB’s policy committee applies to determine 
SOC codes, 911 telephone dispatchers are al-
ready properly and accurately classified. This 
point was reiterated in communications with 
the Education and Labor Committee in 2021, 
explaining, ‘‘After an extensive technical re-
view of the requested reclassification for 911 
dispatchers, OMB, consistent with the rec-
ommendation of the Chief Statistician of the 
United States, decided not to make such an 
adjustment because it is inconsistent with the 
statistical purposes of the SOC.’’ 
Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS), in a written communication with the 
Education and Labor Committee on Sep-
tember 15, 2021, reported that the change 
made by H.R. 1175, a bill identical to Amend-
ment 640, ‘‘will introduce costly, unnecessary 
logistical and data interpretation delays and 
challenges affecting the quality of data.’’ More-
over, changes outside of the routine revision 
process would undermine the goal of data 
continuity, limiting data sources’ usefulness for 
their key purpose of statistical analysis; create 
precedent for disrupting the standard SOC re-
vision process; and undermine the SOCPC’s 
authority as experts to apply the classification 
principles to determine what accuracy re-
quires. 
Public safety telecommunications officers 
perform critical, challenging work. They de-
serve our honor and gratitude for their efforts. 
However, considering the many alternative 
ways policymakers could confer ‘‘validation,’’ 
as the proponents are seeking, there is little 
policy justification for this Amendment’s ap-
proach to achieving that goal. Furthermore, 
the SOC is not intended to rank or group oc-
cupations by education, credentials, earnings, 
benefits, or any other user-defined indicator of 
status. 
In conclusion, mandating a change to a sta-
tistical code would not affect these workers’ 
wages, benefits, or other resources—but it 
would disrupt data series continuity; require 
significant additional work for government 
agencies, researchers, employers, and others; 
and intervene in an official, routine govern-
ment data-collection and statistical process. 
Second, I oppose language in the bill, 
added by Amendment 113 considered on the 
floor as part of the en bloc Amendment 2, 
which would expand the Troops-to-Teachers 
program from recruiting veterans to become 
teachers, to recruiting veterans to fill a longer 
list of school-based positions including school 
resource officers (SROs). Increasing the pres-
ence of SROs can have a particularly harmful 
effect on students of color and students with 
disabilities. Nationally, Black and Latinx youth 
make up over 58 percent of school-based ar-
rests while representing only 40 percent of 
public school enrollment, and Black students 
are more than twice as likely to be referred to 
law enforcement or arrested at school as their 
white peers. According to a 2018 study by 
GAO, Black students, boys, and students with 
disabilities are also disproportionately dis-
ciplined in K–12 public schools. 
Moreover, the amendment removes crucial 
language from the definition of ‘‘eligible 
school’’ which would target resources to high- 
poverty schools. This is concerning with re-
gard to the recruitment of key positions such 
as teachers, school leaders, and counselors to 
meet the needs of students in high-poverty 
schools, particularly as high-poverty schools 
have been disproportionately impacted by re-
cent staffing shortages. 
Finally, I oppose section 572 of the bill, 
added to NDAA during the full committee 
markup of the bill on June 23. The Depart-
ment of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) 
plays a critical role in educating the children of 
our nation’s military families. Across the globe, 
DoDEA coordinates the education of more 
than 60,000 children. Importantly, the DoDEA

also stands apart from other public-school dis-
tricts as one of only two federally operated K– 
12 school systems. 
As a result, while it is within the federal gov-
ernment’s purview to implement the proposed 
requirements for DoDEA schools under this 
legislation, 
these 
proposed 
requirements 
would be inappropriate to impose on tradi-
tional public school districts. This is a unique 
exception in our education system. Moving for-
ward, Congress must continue to ensure that 
state and local governments can meet the 
unique needs of their students and parents 
without mandating requirements regarding the 
rights of parents. 
While I support the overall passage of 
NDAA, I remain opposed to these three provi-
sions.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JIM 
TATE HILL 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Jim Tate Hill, who dedicated his career 
to music, academics, and serving. 
Jim Tate Hill started his career in 1970 
when he decided to give his life to Christ. He 
began his training at St. Paul Church of God 
in Christ (COGIC) in Bakersfield, California 
and continued his education. He attended col-
lege and received his Bachelor’s degree in 
Music Education from the University of 
Pacific’s Conservatory of Music. Jim’s passion 
in music influenced his service to the commu-
nity and through the church. 
He served as the choir director at Glad Tid-
ings COGIC and in 1981, Jim soon grew in 
different roles. He was the Lead Deacon, Sun-
day School Superintendent, Minister of Music, 
and 
Assistant 
Pastor at Bethel Temple 
COGIC. Under Jim’s leadership as pastor of 
Bethel Temple, there were many issues that 
Jim felt needed to be addressed, such as 
youth and early education, homelessness, and 
community revitalization. With his California-li-
cense in general contracting, Jim has assisted 
in building and remodeling over 20 churches 
between Madera and Bakersfield. 
In 2006, Jim was entrusted to be in the 
leading role as Superintendent of the Central 
Valley District. That same year, he was recog-
nized by his contributions to education as one 
of the inaugural recipients of the African-Amer-
ican Heritage Award. During those 41 years, 
he worked under three District Superintend-
ents as the Minister of Music, Sunday School 
Superintendent, and as the Assistant District 
Superintendent. 
In 
2019, 
Bethel 
Temple 
opened Early Readers Preschool, a full pre-
school and daycare center, the only one of its 
kind located at a church in southwest Fresno. 
Jim’s character and work ethic elevated him 
to various roles throughout his life. He was 
recognized for his hard work and for creating 
impacts in the community. He was one of four 
inaugural recipients to receive the Excellence 
of Service medal by Bishop Samuel Doyle at 
the 43rd Annual Jurisdictional Holy Convoca-
tion in 2013. In 2020, Jim was elevated by 
Bishop Doyle to 2nd Admin. Assistant of the 
California Valley Jurisdiction and Chair of the 
Southern Region. 
Jim has a B.A. in Music Education from the 
University of Pacific’s Conservatory of Music. 
He has introduced both kindergarteners and 
high school students, to music ranging from 
classical to gospel for nearly 40 years in 
southwest Fresno. His high school and middle 
school choirs and bands have performed in 
California Music Educators Association fes-
tivals and competitions. 
Jim has been happily married to Missionary 
Carla Hill for 45 years. Together, they have 
three children: Tate II, Paul, and Candice, and 
nine grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the career of Jim Tate Hill and 
may we continue to be inspired by his many 
contributions in the community.

CONGRATULATING CAPTAIN RICH-
ARD RAMSAY ON HIS RETIRE-
MENT FROM THE COLONA FIRE 
DEPARTMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Captain Richard Ramsay who is 
retiring from the Colona Fire Department after 
20 years of service. 
Captain Ramsay joined the Colona Fire De-
partment two decades ago with a passion for 
keeping his neighbors safe. He served many 
roles throughout his tenure with the depart-
ment, including Firefighter, Emergency Med-
ical Technician (EMT), Hazardous Material 
Technician, Safety Officer, and Special Teams 
Leader. His experience and reliability helped 
the department soar to new heights. He was 
a consummate professional with impeccable 
character, unafraid to tackle danger head on, 
no matter the circumstance. Captain Ramsay’s 
impact on the Colona Fire Department and the 
surrounding Quad Cities region is unquestion-
able. I wish him and his family well as he tran-
sitions into this next chapter of life. 
It is because of valiant and selfless leaders 
such as Captain Richard Ramsay that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to, again, formally congratulate Colona 
Fire Department Captain Richard Ramsay on 
his retirement and thank him for his 20 years 
of service to the Colona community.

RECOGNIZING ALL AMERICAN 
PHARMACEUTICALS IN MONTANA 
HON. MATTHEW M. ROSENDALE, Sr. 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the great American inge-
nuity coming out of Montana this month. All 
American Pharmaceuticals in Billings, Mon-
tana, have developed a new baby formula to 
provide relief from the shortage ravaging our 
nation. 
Unfortunately, Biden’s FDA gatekeepers are 
requiring them to jump through endless bu-
reaucratic hoops to get mouths fed. The FDA 
licensed their company to manufacture—but 
not to sell. 
If the Biden administration doesn’t find long- 
term relief for our Nation’s economic and sup-
ply chain issues, we are going to see more 
suffering Americans and more essential goods 
sitting in factories. 
These 
Montanans 
are 
salt-of-the-earth, 
shirt-off-your-back people serving their neigh-
bors. I commend All American Pharma-
ceuticals for their hard work, as well as all the 
nonprofits and charities in Montana supporting 
families and babies in crisis. 
We need more innovators in Montana, and 
fewer gatekeepers in Washington.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH 
T. LETTELLEIR III 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of St. Petersburg 
legend, Joe Lettelleir, who was a giant in 
Pinellas County and left his indelible mark on 
everything he did whether a military veteran, 
business entrepreneur, respected banker, or 
prominent developer. 
Joe moved to St. Petersburg in 1948 and 
attended Northeast High School where he met 
the love of his life, Becky. He attended Indiana 
University for college and served in the U.S. 
Army after graduation. 
A man of many careers, he served as Sen-
ior Executive Vice President of Florida Federal 
Savings and Loan, Founder of Bay Develop-
ment and Bayside Savings and Loan, and 
owner/operator of Paradise Lakes Resort. 
Most recently, Joe served as President and 
CEO of Contemporary Housing Alternatives of 
Florida (CHAF), a non-profit focused on pro-
viding affordable housing solutions in the re-
gion. 
Joe was a well-known leader in St. Pete 
and proudly led countless boards and commit-
tees, including the St. Petersburg Area Cham-
ber of Commerce, Shorecrest Preparatory 
School Board of Trustees, AMIKids, Quarter-
back Club, St. Pete Dragons, the St. Peters-
burg Housing Authority, and Concerned Citi-
zens (STOP the Lens). 
Through his advocacy efforts, especially on 
banking and housing issues, Joe befriended 
countless elected officials and public servants 
including my dear friend, the late Congress-
men C.W. Bill Young and Freddy St. Germain. 
While the body of his professional and char-
itable work was a source of pride, Joe’s most 
meaningful work is the beautiful family he cre-
ated with his wonderful wife of 56 years, 
Becky. Joe and Becky have three loving chil-
dren, Mark, Amy and Matt; and precious 
grandchildren, 
Ryan, 
Riley 
and 
Reece 
Lettelleir, and Megan and Jake Freedman to 
whom he was known as ‘‘Pa.’’ He was a fix-
ture at nearly every football, basketball, and 
baseball game, dance recital, cheerleading 
competition, and any opportunity to show his 
love and support for his children and grand-
children. He was also respected and cher-
ished as a father figure to many of his chil-
dren’s friends, who always sought out his wis-
dom and guidance. 
Joe, with Becky by his side, travelled the 
world, including all 50 states. Most visited dur-
ing long road trips on America’s backroads 
that he loved so much.

A huge sports fan, he was a die-hard Hoo-
sier and an original season ticket holder for 
the Bucs and Rays. He was also a student of 
history and his insatiable curiosity inspired him 
to constantly seek knowledge. 
As a great patriot of this Nation, he fittingly 
departed from this world on July 4th at the 
age of 77. He will be remembered as a man 
of principle and faith, the life of the party, 
ready with a joke or story for any occasion, 
and as a fiercely loyal friend who was always 
willing to lend a helping hand. 
Joe Lettelleir had a life you can hang your

BEAUFORT WATER FESTIVAL 
HON. NANCY MACE 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 66th Annual Beaufort Water 
Festival. Since 1956, the Beaufort community 
has celebrated the community’s waterways 
alongside family and friends, making memo-
ries at this time-honored tradition. 
Each year, local and national businesses, 
civic organizations, the military, and hundreds 
of volunteers give their time and money to 
support the Festival. Each year, the leader of 
these volunteers is announced as the fol-
lowing Festival’s Commodore. 
This year’s commodore, Shawna Doran, has 
given over two decades of service to the Fes-
tival and to the community at large. When she 
isn’t leading the Water Festival’s army of vol-
unteers, Shawna serves the Beaufort commu-
nity as a registered nurse and Vice President 
at Beaufort Memorial Hospital. 
I commend Shawna, and all of the Festival’s 
hundreds of volunteers, for their dedication to 
the festival’s motto of ’’Fun, Sun, and Vitamin 
Sea.’’ 
Lastly, I want to wish one of my dedicated 
district interns, Mason Dalen, good luck as he 
participates in the Badminton Tournament, 
one of the Beaufort Water Festival’s many 
great traditions.

CONGRATULATING SHERIFF BRIAN

ON 
HIS 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
THE 
PEORIA 
COUNTY 
SHERIFF’S OFFICE 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Peoria County Sheriff Brian 
Asbell, who is retiring from the Peoria County 
Sheriff’s Office (PCSO) after 27 years of dig-
nified service. 
Sheriff Asbell has devoted his entire life to 
protecting and serving his neighbors and de-
fending our great nation from all enemies, for-
eign and domestic. His first experience in pub-
lic service was in the U.S. Army as a Combat 
Engineer in the First Cavalry Division at Fort 
Hood, a post he held from 1990 through 1993. 
He transitioned to the Army National Guard 
(ANG) as a Combat Engineer, where he re-
mained until 1996. In the last year of his serv-
ice to ANG, he joined PCSO as a Correctional 
Officer. Though he now had two obligations to 
his immediate community, his commitment 
and dedication to PCSO flourished and in Jan-
uary 1997, Sheriff Asbell was promoted to 
Correctional Sergeant. His unrelenting work 
ethic continued as he was elevated to Patrol 
Deputy in December 2000, then Detective in 
January 2005. In this capacity, he strived to 
reduce crime and solve some of the most dif-
ficult cases in every corner of the county. After 
four years in this capacity, he accepted a new 
role as Undersheriff and Jail Superintendent, 
in which he excelled for seven years. He was 
appointed the 56th Peoria County Sheriff in 
August 2017 and was elected in November 
2018. Not only did Sheriff Asbell carry on the 
honorable legacy of his predecessors, he 
helped to modernize PCSO and reshape its 
relationship with residents. 
It is because of exceptional and valorous 
leaders such as Sheriff Brian Asbell that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to again, formally congratulate Peoria 
County Sheriff Brian Johnson on his retire-
ment and thank him for his 27 years of service 
to our community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GILBERT 
FRANK COELHO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Gilbert Coelho, long-time resi-
dent of Firebaugh, who passed away at age 
80 on April 15, 2022. He was a strong man of 
faith and an excellent example of a man of 
great character. 
Gilbert was born in San Leandro, California. 
He was one of four children born to Otto and 
Alice Coelho, and they were raised on the 
family dairy farm in Dos Palos. Gilbert was in-
volved in 4H and FFA where he raised and 
showed animals with his brothers. He worked 
on the family farm until the 1960’s and at 
Eagle Field and then on to custom farming 
with his father in the Hilmar area. 
Eventually, Gilbert worked with Western 
Farm Service, TRI Farms, and Del Monte 
Fresh Produce. He became a melon growing 
and harvesting specialist, and a well-respected 
Pest Control Advisor. Gilbert retired in 2009 
and continued with agricultural consulting part- 
time. 
In the Dos Palos/Firebaugh area, Gilbert 
met Carol Cunha, the love of his life, and they 
married in November of 1973. Two years later, 
they made their home in Firebaugh, where 
they raised their children and attended St. Jo-
seph’s Catholic Church. Gilbert was an active 
member and served on the church finance 
council and the bereavement committee. 
Gilbert gave back to his community and 
served on the City of Firebaugh/School District 
Community Recreation Commission and acted 
as President of the local Lions Club. He was 
also a member of the Firebaugh Service Club, 
Knights of Columbus and Firebaugh Rotary 
Club. He volunteered for countless local com-
munity activities and was always ready to as-
sist. Another passion he displayed for over 37 
years was his role as School Board Member 
and President of the Firebaugh-Las Deltas 
Unified School District Board. He was also a 
delegate to the California School Boards As-
sociation and an Executive Board Member for 
the Fresno County Trustees association. 
Gilbert helped to establish the Westside In-
stitute of Technology which provided invalu-
able job training to local youth. He developed 
the Firebaugh High School Ag Department Al-
mond Orchard, farming it with the staff and 
youth of the community. He could always be 
seen working the Orchard and serving his 
community. 
Gilbert is survived by his loving wife of 48 
years, Carol; three children, five grandchildren, 
three siblings, five in-laws, and many nieces 
and nephews. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Gilbert Frank Coel-
ho. May he be remembered as an inspiration 
for all who knew him.

HONORING THE LIFE-SAVING 
ACTIONS OF AGENT JOHN LESLIE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize John Leslie of Clinton 
Township, Michigan. His heroic efforts are 
worthy of commendation. 
On the night of Saturday, July 31, 2021, 
John Leslie was driving on Northwestern High-
way when he noticed a vehicle fire on the side 
of the road. The off-duty border patrol officer 
and trained Emergency Medical Technician 
rushed to investigate the scene. Two men who 
were already at the scene told him that there 
was a man trapped in the burning vehicle. He 
saw a person in need and did not hesitate to 
risk his life to save another. 
With the front of the vehicle destroyed by 
the crash, the driver remained trapped in the 
vehicle at a scene that was becoming more 
dangerous by the minute. Endangering him-
self, he climbed into the back of the vehicle to 
see if he could help remove the driver. The 
damage prevented him from pulling him out 
the back or the front. With the clock ticking, he 
noticed a bowling ball in the backseat. After 
several strikes, he broke through the driver’s 
side door and was able to open the door and 
remove the driver. Moments later, the vehicle 
was engulfed in flames. Agent Leslie had 
acted just in time to save the life of the driver. 
Using his training as an Emergency Medical 
Technician, he attended to the driver until the 
authorities arrived on the scene. If it was not 
for Agent Leslie’s heroic actions, the driver 
would not be alive today. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in thanking Agent John Leslie for his 
efforts that saved a life. We are grateful for 
Agent Leslie’s service to our country as a Bor-
der Patrol Agent protecting us from harm. I am 
proud to commemorate his heroic efforts here 
today.

MENT FROM THE MOLINE PO-
LICE DEPARTMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Deputy Chief Brian Johnson, who 
is retiring from the Moline Police Department 
after 22 years of service. 
Deputy Chief Johnson’s career in law en-
forcement began in January 2000 when he 
joined the nearby Silvis Police Department, 
where he stayed for two years. His father, a 
former Sergeant in the East Moline Police De-
partment, helped steer him toward a career in 
public safety. He became an officer in the Mo-
line Police Department in February 2002. Al-
ways looking to rise above the call of duty in 
protecting and serving his neighbors, Deputy 
Chief Johnson worked his way through the 
ranks. He served as Patrol Officer, Street 
Crimes Detective, Patrol Sergeant, Juvenile 
Investigations Sergeant, Patrol Lieutenant, Ac-
creditation and Standards Lieutenant and Op-
erations Captain, before being promoted to 
Deputy Chief in 2021. He is a graduate of 
Kewanee High School in Kewanee, Illinois, 
Western Illinois University, and Northwestern 
Illinois University’s School of Police Staff and 
Command. Deputy Chief Johnson’s contribu-
tions to the Quad Cities community will never 
be forgotten. 
It is because of noble and fearless leaders 
such as Deputy Chief Brian Johnson that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to again, formally congratulate Moline Po-
lice Department Deputy Chief Brian Johnson 
on his retirement and thank him for his 22 
years of service to our community. 
HONORING CITIZENS GUARANTY 
BANK 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize the Citizens Guaranty Bank on its 50th 
anniversary. 
The bank was chartered in 1971 and Ken-
tucky Governor Louie Nunn signed the char-
ter. The bank opened in 1972 in Irvine, Ken-
tucky. Over the years the bank has expended 
its reach and opened offices in Richmond, 
London, and Stanton. It serves many cus-
tomers living in the 6th Congressional District. 
The bank is locally owned and operated, with 
over 75 team members and seven locations. 
The mission of the bank is ‘‘To help our cus-
tomers enhance their lives and achieve their 
dreams while actively supporting our commu-
nities where we live and work’’. Kathy Sam-
ples, who started with the bank in 1977, 
serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chair-
man of the bank. 
It is my honor to recognize the dedicated 
leaders and team members of Citizens Guar-
anty Bank. I congratulate them on their 50- 
year history, celebrate their many accomplish-
ments, and look forward to a bright future of 
serving their customers.

RECOGNIZING THE SUFFERING OF 
THE 
SINDHI 
COMMUNITY 
IN 
PAKISTAN 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
Sindhi Sufi people in Pakistan, and against the 
unconscionable human rights atrocities that 
have been inflicted upon them for years. 
There is perhaps nowhere in the world more 
important for the United States to battle extre-
mism with public diplomacy than Pakistan, a 
nuclear-armed state where numerous extrem-
ists over the years have unfortunately sought 
refuge from justice. Pakistan’s third largest 
province of Sindh is a place of particular con-
cern, where members of the local Sindhi com-
munity find themselves subject to intense and 
unfair government scrutiny. 
Sindhi persons have also been notably ab-
sent from the high echelons of Pakistan’s gov-
ernment. As of 2022, there has not been a 
single Sindhi speaking judge on the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan. Of deepest concern how-
ever are the many instances of human rights 
abuses against the community, including ex-
ceptional jail times for trumped up crimes of 
‘‘blasphemy’’, 
beatings, 
harassment, 
and 
forced disappearances. In 2017 alone, many 
activists, budding politicians, teachers, and 
students were forcibly disappeared by authori-
ties. The Center for Research and Security 
Studies based in Pakistan has reported nearly 
1,500 accusations and cases of blasphemy. 
Out of these 18 women and 71 men have 
been killed extrajudicially between 1947 and 
2021. 
I was made aware of one such case by my 
constituents: the life sentence handed down to 
one man, Notan Lal, the principal of a private 
school and member of Pakistan’s Hindu mi-
nority 
who 
was 
accused 
of 
speaking 
blasphemously about the Prophet Muhammad. 
For this supposed infraction against the com-
mon good, he was arrested in 2019 and ulti-
mately sentenced in February 2022 to 25 
years in prison. No one should ever have to 
face a life in prison on such trumped-up 
charges. 
There is a silver lining however, as Con-
gress continues to hear the cries for help from 
the Sindhi community, we are answering with 
greater efforts to recognize and promote their 
importance. Sindh Caucus Co-Chair Rep-
resentative Brad Sherman and I were espe-
cially grateful to see that our Caucus’ efforts to 
see Voice of America promote additional ma-
terial and resources in the Sindhi language. 
Nearly 14 percent of Pakistanis—over 30 mil-
lion people—speak Sindhi, but there has un-
fortunately never been significant material in 
the language from VOA until now. With this 
new material, it will become easier to reach 
out to the Sindhi community in Pakistan, and 
for them to reach out into the world in turn. 
The people of Pakistan—especially those in 
the Sindhi community—deserve respect for 
their human rights, regardless of creed or con-
viction. I urge my colleagues to continue to 
speak out for the Sindhi community in Paki-
stan and ensure that their human rights are 
respected.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
DARRELL FONSECA 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Darrell Fonseca who is retiring after 32 
years as the City Manager of Dos Palos, Cali-
fornia. Darrell Fonseca is currently the State of 
California’s longest serving City Manager in a 
single city. 
Born and raised in Dos Palos, Darrell Fon-
seca graduated from Dos Palos High School 
and attended Fresno State. After obtaining a 
minor in Philosophy and a Bachelor’s Degree 
in Political Science, Darrell Fonseca went on 
to University of California Berkely, and re-
ceived a Management of Water certificate, and 
graduated from Cal’s Goldman School of Pub-
lic Policy in Strategic Management of Public 
Organizations. 
Darrell was a part of successful political 
campaigns, including the ‘‘Great Speakership 
War’’. One of his employees was a college 
student who later became President Barack 
Obama. He served as a floor manager at the 
National Convention for Gary Hart and was a 
key player in Hart’s California primary cam-
paign for president. At 28 years old, he was 
elected as a Delegate from the 15th Congres-
sional District. Darrell knows how to work in 
many governmental positions. He was an in-
tern for State Senator George Zenovich, a 
Legislative Assistant to then Assemblyman 
and future Congressman Jim Costa, an Asso-
ciate Consultant to the Assembly Committee 
on Aging and Long-Term Care, Chief Consult-
ant to the Select Committee on Energy & Agri-
culture, Assistant to the Majority Whip, and

County Board of Supervisors, was interim Ex-
ecutive Director of the Fresno County and City 
Chamber of Commerce. 
After the passing of his first wife at the age 
of 24 due to cancer, Fonseca moved back to 
Dos Palos to care for his parents. During that 
time, he served on the Economic Develop-
ment Commission, and met the future Mayor, 
Ron Skinner, who encouraged him to apply for 
city manager and a new chapter in his life 
began. This decision led him as the city’s 7th 
City Manager, its 14th CEO, 14th Police Com-
missioner, and the 15th City Clerk. As City 
Manager, Darrell worked with 10 mayors and 
32 councilmembers. 
He attributes his success to having a hard 
working and knowledgeable staff and by lis-
tening to their advice. Darrell has helped with 
the emergency services for nearby schools, 
Measure V, transportation improvements, pay-
ing off debts, helped in building a new water 
plant, and more. During his free time, Darrell 
spends time with his wife Maria. Together, 
they have three children, 8 grandchildren, and 
1 great-grandson, and hosted a foreign ex-
change student from Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Darrell Fonseca in his retire-
ment after 32 years as the City Manager of 
Dos Palos, California and among California’s 
482 cities, currently holds the title as the State 
of California’s longest serving city manager in 
a single city.

RECOGNIZING BILL TRUEIT FOR 33 
YEARS OF OUTSTANDING SERV-
ICE IN PUBLIC EDUCATION 
HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank Mr. Bill Trueit for 33 years of invalu-
able service to students and families in Wash-
ington’s 1st Congressional District. I want to 
extend my sincerest congratulations and grati-
tude to Mr. Trueit on his retirement from Henry 
M. Jackson High School in Mill Creek, WA 
where he taught U.S. Government and Civics. 
I had the privilege of visiting his classroom 
every year possible and can speak directly to 
Mr. Trueit’s passion for educating Washing-
ton’s students. Under his tenure, countless 
students have been encouraged to pursue 
their dreams, learn new skills, and serve our 
communities. Bill’s presence in our schools 
will be deeply missed, but his impact for 
Washington’s students will not be soon forgot-
ten. It is truly bittersweet to see him go. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Mr. Trueit and wishing him the 
best in his retirement.

CONGRATULATING 
LESLIE 
HAYNES ON HER RETIREMENT 
AS A DISPATCHER FOR GALES-
BURG/KNOX COUNTY 9–1–1 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Leslie Haynes on her retire-
ment from her position as Dispatcher for 
Galesburg/Knox County 9–1–1. 
Leslie is from the Galesburg area and 
began her career as a 9–1–1 dispatcher at 
Galesburg/Knox County 9–1–1 on October 9, 
2000. During the first half of her career, she 
worked second shift, and later transitioned to 
first shift. Leslie is described as a wonderful 
and caring coworker. Her colleagues also de-
scribed her as dedicated and hardworking. 
When life throws her difficult circumstances, 
Leslie maintains a positive attitude and con-
tinues to serve her community, which shows a 
great amount of strength. She leads by exam-
ple, and she served the citizens of Knox 
County with compassion and unwavering dedi-
cation. Leslie is also a mother of two and 
grandmother of five. 
It is because of community leaders like Les-
lie Haynes that I am especially proud to serve 
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Leslie Haynes on her retirement from 
the Galesburg/Knox County 9–1–1 as a Dis-
patcher.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my amendment, Lee number 
three eight three, to repeal the 2002 Author-
ization for Use of Force against Iraq. 
I want to thank my cosponsors, including 
Chairman MEEKS of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, and Chairmen SMITH and MCGOVERN 
for their support to permit me to offer this 
amendment. 
This amendment is simple: it would termi-
nate the outdated but still dangerous 2002 Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force. 
I say ‘‘outdated’’ because the 2002 AUMF 
no longer serves any operational purpose. 
U.S. military deployments and operations car-
ried out under the 2002 AUMF—dubbed Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom—officially concluded in 
2011. 
I say ‘‘dangerous’’ because the 2002 con-
tained no sunset provision. Leaving this out-
dated and unnecessary authorization on the 
books allows Presidents to utilize it for military 
action Congress never intended to authorize. 
This House has already voted three times to 
repeal this AUMF—most recently in June of 
last year, when the House adopted this same 
language by a vote of 268 to 161. 
And last year, the President formally en-
dorsed repeal of the 2002 AUMF, issuing a 
Statement of Administration Policy in favor of 
repeal, stating that the 2002 AUMF serves no 
purpose. 
We cannot afford to leave outdated AUMFs 
on the books indefinitely. It is past time for 
Congress to finally do our Constitutional duty 
and vote on matters of war and peace. 
Madam Speaker, nothing telegraphs Amer-
ica’s indecision more than our failure to end 
wars that are long over. I urge all Members to 
support my amendment, repeal the 2002 
AUMF, and assert our Article One responsi-
bility to define when and how our country goes 
to war. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc No. 4, 
which contains a number of provisions that the 
Committee on Homeland Security has ad-
vanced in a bipartisan manner. 
I am pleased that it includes Amendment 
No. 390 that contains the text of H.R. 903, the 
Rights for the TSA Workforce Act of 2022, as 
passed by the House in May. 
Under TSA’s current personnel system, the 
agency regularly ranks at, or near, the bottom 
of the annual Federal employee satisfaction 
surveys and suffers from high attrition. 
The most recent Inspector General analysis 
of employee turnover revealed that in a single 
year, TSA spent roughly $16 million on hiring 
and training nearly 2,000 people who left just 
months after they got the job. 
Such costly and disruptive turnover risks 
hampering security operations and must be 
addressed meaningfully. 
My amendment seeks to attract and retain a 
mature and stable workforce within TSA by 
placing the agency under the Federal per-
sonnel system set forth in title 5 of the U.S. 
Code. 
Getting the TSA workforce under the per-
sonnel system under which most other Fed-
eral employees operate has been a priority for 
many of us for decades. The unprecedented 
support by the Biden administration has sig-
nificantly improved prospects for getting this 
done. And this amendment’s inclusion in the 
NDAA provides an opportunity to engage with 
our Senate partners in a timely way. 
Additionally, I am pleased that En Bloc No. 
4 includes Amendment No. 420 that I filed 
with Rep. JOHN KATKO of New York, the Rank-
ing Member of the Committee on Homeland 
Security. It contains the text of 25 bipartisan 
homeland security measures that the House 
had previously approved. 
These measures would strengthen commu-
nity security, improve Department of Home-
land Security acquisitions and supply chains, 
and enhance DHS operations. The bipartisan 
amendment includes provisions to increase 
funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Pro-
gram from $75 million to $500 million for each 
fiscal year through 2028, reform the way DHS 
procures uniforms issued to Department front-
line personnel by encouraging the procure-
ment of domestically sourced items by U.S. 
small businesses, reauthorize the U.S. Secret 
Service’s National Computer Forensics Insti-
tute, authorize a one-stop screening process 
for certain arriving international travelers, and 
authorize grants to carry out the Cybersecurity 
Education and Training Assistance Program, 
or CETAP—a program to strengthen K–12 cy-
bersecurity education. 
I am also pleased that the en bloc includes 
a measure (Amendment No. 526) authored by 
Rep. AL GREEN of Texas to bolster the au-
thorities and operations of the Department’s 
Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office. 
Finally, I am delighted to have the support 
of Rep. PETER DEFAZIO of Oregon, the Chair-
man of the Transportation and Infrastructure

Committee, on Amendment No. 441, which is 
also included in the en bloc package and 
seeks to support the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency in its efforts to instill equity 
as a foundation of emergency management. 
Studies have found that low-income commu-
nities, rural areas, racial minorities, tribes, indi-
viduals with disabilities, seniors, and children 
are all more likely to experience the most dev-
astating impacts of disasters. Yet, many in 
these communities and groups face an uphill 
battle to navigate the complicated Federal as-
sistance processes. With hurricane season un-
derway and wildfires wreaking havoc on com-
munities big and small, passage of my amend-
ment is very timely. 
I thank Committee on Armed Services 
Chairman ADAM SMITH of Washington and his 
staff for their partnership with me and my staff 
throughout this entire process. Looking ahead, 
I am eager to work with the Senate to get 
these important provisions in the final NDAA

HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF EDWARD STACK 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a remarkable man, a living legend, 
and a champion of civil rights. Although Ed-
ward Stack is not being inducted today, and it 
has been said by his high school coach that 
he couldn’t ‘‘catch a baseball with a bushel 
basket’’, this man is the heart and soul of the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame. Born in Sea 
Cliff, and a longtime resident of Glen Head, 
New York, Ed served as Chairman of the 
Board from 1977 to 2000, and as an officer 
from 1961 to 1977. Due to his tireless efforts, 
the Hall of Fame saw tremendous growth and 
multi-million-dollar expansions. Even more sig-
nificant, were the historical milestones which 
took place under Ed’s leadership. The most 
notable being the inclusion of former Negro 
League players, who had been excluded from 
Major League baseball prior to Jackie Robin-
son. 
The inclusion of the Negro League super-
stars was a moment of lasting pride, according 
to Ed. It was a victory for civil rights and the 
correction of an injustice which, Ed says, took 
way too long to be corrected. With Ed’s ef-
forts, players such as Satchel Paige, Josh 
Gibson, Judy Johnson, Cool Papa Bell, Buck 
Leonard, and Martin Dihigo, those whose 
groundbreaking accomplishments had been 
overlooked simply due their color, were finally 
given the recognition they deserved. 
In order to protect the integrity of baseball, 
Ed fought to prohibit players who broke the 
rules, specifically those who used performance 
enhancing drugs. Ed is well known to many 
acclaimed baseball celebrities who adore him. 
Babe Ruth’s widow, Claire, considered him a 
close friend. Yogi Berra and his wife affection-
ately called Ed ‘‘blue eyes.’’ Ed has also vis-
ited numerous presidents in the Oval Office 
and had a special bond with Ronald Reagan. 
As impressive as Ed’s professional accom-
plishments is his generosity. In his retirement, 
Ed serves as an officer or director for 19 dif-
ferent charitable and cultural organizations, in-
cluding the Bassett Medical Center, the Farm-
ers’ Museum, the New York State Trooper 
Foundation, the Salvation Army, and the Men-
tal Health Association of Nassau County. 
He is a frequent donor to his alma mater, 
Pace University, where he once served as stu-
dent council president. Ed invests in education 
because he hopes to give others the same op-
portunity for success that he had. In 1991, 
Pace recognized his outstanding contribution 
by awarding him an honorary Doctor of Hu-
mane Letters. In tribute to Ed’s constant sup-
port, the University named the Edward W. 
Stack ‘‘56 Suite’’ at Alumni Hall, in his honor. 
Today, Ed and his wife, Christina, have 
used their financial success to support those 
in need. They are significant donors to mul-
tiple philanthropic causes. The SCO Family of 
Services describe the couple’s compassion by 
saying, ‘‘Ed Stack and his wife Chris are in a 
league of their own when it comes to helping 
others.’’ 
Ed and his wife raised three beautiful 
daughters named Amy, Kim, and Suzanne. Ed 
is also a beloved ‘‘Opa,’’ or grandfather, to 
Kara, Lucy, and McGill. Ed’s daughters de-
scribe their father as hardworking and resil-
ient. As a child, Ed had overcome Polio. He 
was told he would never walk again, but Ed 
persevered and proved the doctors wrong. Al-
though walking was difficult, Ed would com-
mute an hour and a half to work every day. 
Ed’s daughter Amy describes Ed’s dedication 
as such that sometimes he’d fall down the 
train stairs because his legs would give out, 
but she never remembers him ever com-
plaining about his commute. Amy says that it 
always amazes her that her father could drink 
a cup of black coffee at 11pm before going to 
bed, have no problem sleeping, and then 
wake up at 5am to catch the train. 
Ed’s whole life was about helping others. 
During the rare moments when Ed was not in 
meetings, he would spend his time walking his 
dogs at Tappen Beach, baking gluten free 
bread for Kim, and helping his children with 
their homework. Ed also loved to care for the 
elderly. On weekends Ed would take his family 
with him to different elderly friends’ houses, 
and Ed’s family would help them with their 
taxes or finances. Now, as a grandfather, Ed 
can be found doting on his grandchildren and 
giving them scooter rides around the hallways 
of the Harborside Community in Port Wash-
ington. 
As the famous poet from our district, Walt 
Whitman, once said, ‘‘I see great things in 
baseball.’’ Baseball is more than a game; it is 
a thread which has tied Americans of all back-
grounds together since the beginning of our 
nation’s history. During the Civil War, baseball 
was used to boost morale on the battlefield. 
During World War Two, President Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt stated in his famous green 
light letter that, even in these trying times, ‘‘I 
honestly feel that it would be best for the 
country to keep baseball going.’’ Today we 
proudly recognize and thank Ed for his trail-
blazing contributions to our national pastime, 
his contributions to social justice, and his im-
mense philanthropy.

for at-risk youth. He opened the Kids Cafe´ and 
the Lighthouse for Children Center in down-

dents across 32 school districts and over 345

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring his receipt of the 2022 Harold 
Haak Award. Jim A. Yovino’s tremendous con-
tributions to the culture, community, and edu-
cation system of Fresno County deserve the

SPEECH OF 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I

bloc No. 4, offered by my good friend from 
Rhode Island, Mr. CICILLINE. I am proud to co-
sponsor this amendment and urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
This amendment would safeguard important 
protections for servicemembers and their fami-
lies by preventing the enforcement of forced 
arbitration clauses in any dispute covered 
under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act 
(SCRA). The SCRA was passed to ease fi-
nancial burdens on servicemembers when 
they are required to relocate for active duty 
assignments and protects them from eviction, 
foreclosure, and other financial penalties. Un-
fortunately, forced arbitration clauses deny our 
troops the ability to exercise their SCRA rights 
and protections in court. This is not right. Our 
servicemembers deserve peace of mind while 
they are out fighting for our freedoms, which 
is why Rep. CICILLINE and I are offering this 
amendment. 
It is worth noting this language was included 
in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Au-
thorization Act that passed the House with bi-
partisan 
support, 
but 
unfortunately 
was 
stripped during negotiations with the Senate. I 
urge my colleagues to vote yes on amend-
ment No. 431 so we can ensure our military 
men and women can focus on their missions 
rather than worry about financial burdens at 
home.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
FORMER 
PRIME 
MINISTER 
SHINZO ABE 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise to com-
memorate the life of former Prime Minister 
Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated on July 8, 
2022. The whole world mourns the loss of this 
great leader—the longest serving prime min-
ister in the history of Japan. As the leader of 
his party, he won an unprecedented four elec-
tions spanning a time period of eleven years. 
His popularity was undeniable. 
Prime Minister Abe always focused on the 
positive contributions made by the Japanese 
people. Instead of apologizing for the sins of 
his forebears, he promoted economic and for-
eign policies that put the people of Japan first. 
He was not afraid of China and taught the 
watching world that strength in the face of 
communist totalitarianism beats coddling and 
submission. This great patriot never tired in 
his commitment to fight for his people. 
Prime Minister Abe taught the world about 
true leadership. Take care of your own people. 
Protect them. Value them. 
I offer my condolences and deep sym-
pathies to the people of Japan, and the friends 
and family of Mr. Abe. They gave the world a 
shining star. And now he returns to the heav-
ens.

SUPPORT OF H.R. 7900, NATIONAL 
DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION 
ACT 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my amendments to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. My amend-
ments seek to better understand the mental 
health challenges and mechanisms of support 
available to servicemembers; mandate strong 
reports which will be critical in enacting better 
policy for servicemembers in the future; and 
make defense communities more resilient to 
the growing threat of climate change. 
The first amendment (Amendment No. 322), 
which my colleague, Congresswoman ELAINE 
LURIA, has cosponsored, represents an impor-
tant step forward in better understanding and 
combatting the epidemic of suicide facing not 
just the Navy, but the entire armed forces. 
There is a dearth of information about suicide 
and suicide prevention in the Navy, particularly 
on Navy ships. This is why directing the In-
spector General of the Department of Defense 
to compile and publish a report on instances 
of suicide, suicide prevention, and response 
within the Navy is so important. This report will 
be comprehensive and desperately needed, 
given how little we truly understand why some 
sailors choose to end their lives, as well as 
the failures of command and areas where 
available resources have failed to catch and 
prevent these tragedies. 
Additionally, the report will contain a survey 
of the mental health teams found on Navy 
ships and installations, so that we might better 
understand the limitations faced by these crit-
ical teams to properly treat, prevent, and re-
spond to instances of suicidal ideation, suici-
dal intent, and suicidal attempts of the crew-
members they serve. These mental health 
teams are critical components of every unit, 
but do not always have the staff or resources 
available to provide necessary treatment and 
counseling to the sailors under their care. This 
report will be critical in better understanding 
the shortfalls these teams face, which will 
allow us to set them up for better successes 
in the future. 
The discussion of suicides in the Navy is a 
personal one. I have lost constituents in the 
Navy, particularly this year wherein the shock-
ing number of sailors who died by suicide 
while serving on the USS George Washington 
in Newport News, Virginia made national 
headlines. It is my belief that this DoD report 
will be the first step in better understanding 
how to prevent another, similar tragedy and 
see where the Navy could be doing more to 
actively support its servicemembers during 
times of mental and emotional crisis. 
My second amendment (Amendment No. 
323) requires the Inspector General of the De-
partment of Defense to survey and report on 
programs across the armed services which 
allow servicemembers to file anonymous com-
plaints and concerns without fear of identifica-
tion or reprisal from command. 
The chain of command is something that 
every soldier and employee of the Department 
of Defense is taught to respect from the ear-
liest days of training. Soldiers know there are 
some issues they cannot voice without risking 
the ire of their commanding officers or drawing 
undue attention to themselves, even if the na-
ture of their complaint is a valid quality of life 
concern, a note about morale, a safety issue, 
or any reasonable request for support from ex-
isting Department services and programs. 
Programs which allow anonymous complaint 
filing for servicemembers fill a critical gap of 
inter-unit communication by encouraging sol-
diers to advocate for themselves through a 
channel which they know will protect their 
identity and be taken seriously and reviewed 
on its merits. However, there is currently no 
DoD-wide review of where such programs 
exist, making it difficult to gauge their level of 
user participation, analyze data on the sorts of 
complaints filed, or even know which units and 
branches support such programs. This is a 
gap in knowledge that merits a proper review 
by the Department of Defense, so that we 
may better understand what support our sol-
diers are asking for and where they are and 
aren’t being given the opportunity to even ask. 
My third amendment (Amendment No. 321) 
seeks to improve adaptation and emergency 
management 
coordination 
between 
state, 
local, and federal entities in defense commu-
nities, especially the Department of Defense. 
By creating interagency regional resilience co-
ordinator positions in defense communities, 
this amendment will enhance military readi-
ness and community resilience. I was pleased 
to have the support of my colleagues, Con-
gresswoman LURIA, a member of the House 
Armed Services Committee and veteran of the 
Navy; Congressman WITTMAN, a senior mem-
ber of the Armed Services Committee; Con-
gressman MCEACHIN; and Congresswoman 
SA´NCHEZ on this important amendment. 
As a Nation, our aging stormwater infra-
structure, housing stock, emergency manage-
ment systems, and power grid exacerbate the 
threats of climate change. Thanks to the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act, the United 
States is making our infrastructure more resil-
ient and creating jobs in the process. These 
investments in our infrastructure will help pro-
tect our communities and prevent needless 
loss and human suffering. 
The Department of Defense recognizes that, 
as the climate changes, ‘‘leveraging knowl-
edge and actions when planning climate 
change adaptation and emergency prepared-
ness and response requires expanded col-
laboration with surrounding communities.’’ This 
is especially true in Hampton Roads, Virginia 
due to the significant federal footprint, includ-
ing 15 military bases, and the region’s geo-
graphic complexities. 
In my district and throughout Hampton 
Roads, communities play an essential role in 
supporting critical defense installations. Com-
munity assets, infrastructure, and services en-
sure the region’s bases are ready and provide 
the region’s 83,000 active-duty service mem-
bers and their families with amenities to live, 
get to work, and recreate. The threat of sea 
level rise and increasingly frequent and severe 
storms, however, jeopardize these community 
services and military readiness. 
Fortunately, 
the 
region 
has 
developed 
strong cooperation and expertise in this re-
gard. This acumen and spirit of collaboration 
are clear in the two recent Joint Land Use 
Studies and a 2016 report released following

the Hampton Roads Sea Level Rise Prepared-
ness and Resilience Intergovernmental Pilot 
Project. 
Thanks to the hard work of local govern-
ments, federal partners, the Hampton Roads 
Planning District Commission, and academic 
support from Old Dominion University and oth-
ers, much has been done to implement the 
recommendations of these studies. 
That being said, much work remains to be 
done. Recommendations from the earlier pilot 
project and Joint Land Use Studies that are 
ripe for action include a number of items that 
require collaboration with the federal govern-
ment. The establishment of Interagency Re-
gional Coordinators for Resilience positions 
would be well suited to address persistent 
challenges that have hindered the ‘‘whole of 
government’’ and ‘‘whole of community’’ ap-
proach that the growing threats require. 
As the climate continues to change, lessons 
learned from these partnerships would be ben-
eficial to defense communities and others that 
support federal entities and assets of national 
importance. 
Addressing the threat of climate change and 
ensuring members of the armed services have 
access to comprehensive mental health serv-
ices and mechanisms to confidently advocate 
for their quality of life is not only crucial to en-
suring military readiness, addressing these 
threats is morally imperative. 
Lastly, I am pleased that my amendment 
(Amendment No. 618) regarding the transfer 
of federal land currently occupied by the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) in the City of Norfolk has been in-
cluded in this package. I am disappointed to 
lose a valuable asset in my district as they 
continue their planned move to Rhode Island, 
and it is important that this economic impact 
does not further affect the city. Transferring 
the land without cost to the city and in a timely 
manner will allow Norfolk and the Army Corps 
of Engineers to better protect the city from fu-
ture flooding. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
Chairman SMITH for his work on behalf of our 
Nation’s military and his support for these ini-
tiatives, and I urge my colleagues to support 
these important amendments.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
WOODHAVEN POLICE CHIEF ROB-
ERT TOTH 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Chief Robert Toth on the 
occasion of his retirement from Woodhaven 
Police Department. His thirty years of service 
to the Woodhaven community are worthy of 
commendation. 
A graduate of Siena Heights University, the 
Eastern Michigan University Police Staff and 
Command School, and the FBI National Acad-
emy, Chief Robert Toth began his career as 
an intern for the Adrian Police Department, 
later serving as a Police Officer. On January 
13, 1992, he was hired by the Woodhaven Po-
lice Department. Over the course of his ca-
reer, he has served in every position that the 
department has to offer. In his thirty years at 
the Woodhaven Police Department, Chief Toth 
has served as a Patrol Officer, as an Under-
cover Narcotics Investigator, in the Traffic Bu-
reau, and in the Detective Bureau. As a val-
ued leader in the department, he was pro-
moted to Sergeant, Lieutenant, and then Dep-
uty Chief, finally becoming Chief of Police in 
August 2017. 
In addition to his job at the Woodhaven Po-
lice Department, Chief Toth has served as a 
member of the Downriver SWAT team for 
twenty-two years before retiring in 2016. He 
also took time to share his extensive law en-
forcement experience with others and volun-
teered as an advisor for the Woodhaven Po-
lice Explorers for fourteen years, taught class-
es at the Wayne County Regional Police 
Academy, and acted as drill instructor at the 
State Explorer Academy. Though he may be 
retiring, Chief Toth remains active in the de-
partment’s Honor Guard. A treasured mentor 
and 
friend, 
he 
continues 
to 
reside 
in 
Woodhaven with his wife Lauren and their two 
sons. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in congratulating Chief Robert Toth 
for his exemplary career in public service at 
the Woodhaven Police Department. I join with 
Chief Toth’s family, friends, and colleagues in 
extending my gratitude to him for his honor-
able service and thank him for his role in pro-
tecting our community and the people of 
Woodhaven for the past three decades. We 
wish him the best in retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MAJOR 
NHIA LONG VANG 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 14, 2022 
Mr. COSTA, Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Nhia Long Vang, a Major in the Special 
Guerilla Unit (SGU) Secret War in Laos, a 
husband, father, and a beloved community ac-
tivist in the Central Valley. 
Nhia was born in the farm fields of Laos on 
October 12, 1939. His parents, Neng Yia Vang 
and Mai Vang were gifted with six children; 
the eldest being Nhia. Neng was the Head 
Chief of the village. Nhia attended first grade 
and second grade at 19 years old. He was 
then recruited by the United States Central In-
telligence Agency to serve in the ‘‘Secret War 
in Laos’’ during the Vietnam War. Nhia was 
promoted to Sergeant by General Vang Pao 
and attended ‘‘Special Guerilla Unit’’ training in 
Phitsanulok, Thailand. He reported directly to 
the Central Intelligence Agency as he carried 
out top secret missions. 
Missions led by Nhia were not unnoticed by 
his superiors. He led intelligence missions in 
Ho Chi Minh Trail, Road 7, so they could sur-
veillance the Pathet Lao and Vietnamese ar-
mies’ operations, reported to CIA head-
quarters in Laos. Not long after being pro-
moted to Captain in 1969, he was assigned to 
oversee the Hmong CIA soldiers’ unit. Heavy 
combat fighting was expected in this unit. De-
spite suffering severe injuries, Nhia survived a 
shrapnel injury, and in 1970, the troops trained 
under him were transferred to support the 
Plains of Jars. 
His contributions to helping in the war were 
endless. Nhia helped in aiding and rescuing 
American pilots after crashing in the jungle, 
and after attending special advanced oper-
ational military training, he was promoted to 
Major. His final assignment was supporting the 
Royal Laos armies in their fight against the Vi-
etnamese army. His bravery, courage, and 
leadership undoubtedly saved many lives. 
Nhia received asylum in Nam Pong, Thai-
land before relocating to the United States 
with his family. He married Lee Yang and they 
had children. In 1972, he married Ka Moua. 
They he had a loving family raising 13 chil-
dren. Nhia and his family eventually moved to 
Missoula, Montana. He cleaned Missoula’s ca-
nals and after two years, they moved in 1982 
to Santa Ana, California before settling in 
Fresno in 1983. 
After serving the Hmong Community as a 
translator for the health clinic, Nhia returned to 
his roots and became a farmer mentoring oth-
ers on how to be successful in selling South-
east Asian vegetables to wholesalers and re-
tailers. Nhia used his experience to help fami-
lies become self-sufficient while providing re-
sources to health services and education and 
stressed the importance of voting. He showed 
unparalleled support, both financial and emo-
tional, to Hmong and Lao veterans and their 
families. Nhia and I visited the White House 
and California State Capitol with Charlie 
Waters and Bill Dietzel, regarding local vet-
eran community affairs. He worked with Dan 
Payne to have the community represented in 
the Central Valley Veterans Day Parade. Nhia 
enjoyed the Hmong New Year celebrations in 
Fresno and supported many Hmong and Lao 
cultures. In 2001, he was one of the Hmong 
Community Organizers campaigning and urg-
ing Hmong families to donate in support of the 
9/11 families. The group raised over one hun-
dred thousand dollars for the Red Cross. 
His service earned him numerous special 
recognitions and certificates from Congress, 
the California State Assembly, and the County 
of Fresno. In 2021, the City of Fresno recog-
nized him for his many accomplishments and 
service to the community. He educated people 
on General Vang Pao’s legacy every Decem-
ber and advocated for the naming of Vang 
Pao Elementary School in Fresno. He advo-
cated for the Hmong Language Program in 
Fresno Unified School District which passed in 
2016. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Major Nhia Long 
Vang of the Special Guerilla Unit (SGU) Se-
cret War in Laos. May we continue to be in-
spired by his story.
