Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2021 
No. 36 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the 
order of the House of January 4, 2021, 
the Chair will now recognize Members 
from lists submitted by the majority 
and minority leaders for morning-hour 
debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m. 
f 
OPEN BORDERS BETRAY BLUE 
COLLAR WORKERS 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
before the lockdown left took a wreck-
ing ball to our economy, we were en-
joying one of the greatest expansions 
of economic opportunity in our life-
times. Unemployment was at its lowest 
rate in 50 years. The poverty rate was 
at its lowest rate in 60 years. Most im-
portantly, wage growth was the strong-
est in 40 years, and the wage gap be-
tween rich and poor was narrowing for 
the first time in many years as blue- 
collar wages increased dramatically. 
The unemployment rate for women was 
the lowest in 70 years. For African 
Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian 
Americans, veterans, disabled Ameri-
cans, and those without a high school 
diploma, unemployment was the lowest 
ever recorded. 
Now, the tax and regulatory relief we 
won in 2017 and 2018 explained much of 
that success. But something else was 
going on that caused the extraordinary 
improvement of wages for unskilled or 
low-skilled workers. It was because the 
Trump administration restored control 
of our borders and stemmed the flood 
of low-wage labor that had been sup-
pressing wages for American workers 
for decades. Big business and big agri-
culture hated this policy because it re-
quired them to pay higher wages to 
Americans, but in the growing econ-
omy it produced, working Americans 
who had been left behind for decades fi-
nally began to prosper. 
Now, did we learn nothing from this 
blue-collar boom? 
The Democrats that these families 
trusted to look out for their interests 
in the recent election are betraying 
them at every turn. Nowhere is that 
clearer than the Democrats’ zeal to 
open our borders to a new wave of ille-
gal immigration. 
The 
President’s 
executive 
orders 
have already produced a new migrant 
crisis on the southern border. One 
abandoned the border wall in mid-con-
struction. 
Another 
undermines 
the 
longstanding requirement that immi-
grants be able to support themselves 
and not burden American taxpayers. 
Another ends the Remain in Mexico 
policy for those making asylum claims, 
the vast majority of those claims being 
dubious. Yet another effectively re-
leases illegal immigrants accompanied 
by youths under 18 directly into the 
United States. 
Another grants what amounts to 
sanctuary status for a wide variety of 
criminal 
offenses, 
including 
drunk 
driving and sex offenses. Another re-
stores unrestricted travel from hotbeds 
of international terrorism. 
The worst one orders ICE not to de-
port illegal immigrants for 100 days. 
That order now enjoined by a Federal 
judge begs the question: What is the 
difference between abolishing ICE and 
forbidding ICE to do its job? 
Customs 
and 
Border 
Protection 
agents report in the last month the 
flow on the southern border has nearly 
doubled from 2,000 a day to 3,500 a day. 
The number of illegal immigrants en-
countered on the southern border dur-
ing the first 4 months of the last fiscal 
year was nearly 165,000. That number 
has nearly doubled this year to more 
than 295,000. 
Every American needs to clearly un-
derstand what this means to their 
lives, their families, their commu-
nities, and their futures. 
How are American workers helped by 
flooding the labor market with another 
wave of illegal immigration? 
How are our children, who have been 
robbed of an entire year of their edu-
cations, helped by filling their class-
rooms with non-English speaking class-
mates? 
How are our streets made safer by al-
lowing aliens who drive drunk to re-
main on our roads rather than be ar-
rested and placed in removal pro-
ceedings? 
How is our Nation made safer by re-
opening virtually unrestricted travel 
with nations that foster terrorism? 
How are our communities made safer 
by making it harder to deport criminal 
illegal aliens and gang members? 
How are our hospitals made more ac-
cessible by overwhelming emergency 
rooms by illegal immigrants demand-
ing care? 
Why would they pursue these policies 
that strike most acutely and painfully 
at America’s working families? Espe-
cially now when those families are 
reeling from the effects of a year of re-
pressive lockdowns? 
Those blue-collar workers who made 
the greatest gains during the Trump 
economic 
expansion 
are 
the 
most 
harmed by reversing the immigration 
enforcement that produced it. 
Let us not forget that millions of 
legal immigrants who obeyed our laws, 
respected our Nation’s sovereignty, 
waited patiently, and have done every-
thing our country has asked of them 
have also been made victims of the 
Democrats’ pursuit of open borders.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H622 
February 25, 2021 
Without enforcement of our immi-
gration laws, our borders are meaning-
less. And if our borders are meaning-
less, then America ceases to be a na-
tion and instead becomes a vast inter-
national territory between Canada and 
Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I fear that is the ulti-
mate objective of the left and that the 
only force that can stop them now is 
the American people at the ballot box. 
f 
EXPANDING CIVIL RIGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
QUIGLEY). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MUR-
PHY) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of the Equality 
Act, a long overdue measure I cospon-
sored to expand important civil rights 
protections to every American. 
This is personal for me and my dis-
trict. Central Florida is an area that 
prides itself on its diversity, compas-
sion, and inclusiveness. But tragedy 
struck in June 2016, when a gunman 
walked into the Pulse nightclub and 
took the lives of 49 innocent individ-
uals. Our community relied on those 
same 
values—diversity, 
compassion, 
and inclusiveness—to overcome hate 
and move forward together with love. 
But despite tremendous progress our 
Nation has made toward equality, too 
many LGBTQ Americans still live in 
fear. That is because LGBTQ people 
across the country remain vulnerable 
to discrimination on a daily basis. The 
Equality Act ensures protections that 
already exist for other protected class-
es are equally available to all Ameri-
cans. It is past time we pass this bill so 
that no American faces discrimination 
because of who they are or whom they 
love. 
HONORING DAVID KING 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to honor David King, a con-
stituent of mine who passed away re-
cently. 
David was born and raised in Ten-
nessee. He attended Tennessee Tech-
nical 
College 
and 
Vanderbilt 
Law 
School, where he was an editor of the 
law review. David then served honor-
ably in the Marine Corps, deploying to 
Vietnam. Following his military serv-
ice, David relocated to Orlando with 
his college sweetheart, Marilyn, by his 
side. Together, they made central Flor-
ida home. 
David was a trial attorney of skill 
and integrity, earning the esteem of 
fellow 
lawyers 
and 
judges. 
David 
fought vigorously for his clients but al-
ways treated his courtroom opponents 
and the justice system itself with re-
spect. 
David served as lead attorney for the 
Fair District Coalition, which worked 
to end partisan gerrymandering in 
Florida. David was dedicated to the 
cause of free and fair elections and to 
the principle that every vote matters 
in our democracy. David was deeply 
committed to his central Florida com-
munity, generously giving his time, en-
ergy, and financial support to many 
local nonprofit organizations. 
David’s 
proudest 
accomplishment 
was his family, especially his 56-year 
marriage to Marilyn and the sons and 
grandchildren their happy union pro-
duced. 
May God bless the memory of this 
wonderful man, and may God bless his 
family, his friends, and all those who 
loved him. 
f 
REMEMBERING RONNIE MOHR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in remembrance of my friend and fel-
low Hoosier, Ronnie Mohr. 
Ronnie was a 1966 graduate from Han-
cock Central High School before re-
ceiving a degree at Purdue and then 
serving in the United States Army 
101st Airborne Division during the 
Vietnam war. 
Ronnie was a pillar in the Greenfield 
community and a well-respected farm-
er across the State. He was also a 
member of my Agricultural Advisory 
Board on top of being a member of the 
Indiana 
Corn 
Growers 
Association, 
Hancock County Sheriff’s Merit Board, 
NineStar Connect Board, and Hancock 
County Drainage Board. 
My thoughts are with his wife, Sarah; 
his three children; and his 10 grand-
children. Ronnie’s legacy will live on 
forever. 
COLUMBUS, INDIANA’S BICENTENNIAL 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in celebration of my hometown, Co-
lumbus, Indiana’s bicentennial. 
For 200 years, Columbus has been a 
vibrant community sitting between In-
dianapolis and Louisville. Today, it is 
world renowned for its modern and con-
temporary architecture. It has been my 
home for my entire life, and I am proud 
to be serving my hometown commu-
nity. 
Happy 200th birthday to Columbus, 
Indiana. 
CONGRATULATING INDIANA SECRETARY OF 
STATE CONNIE LAWSON 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate my friend, Indiana Sec-
retary of State Connie Lawson, on her 
retirement. 
Secretary Lawson is a true public 
servant who dedicated her life to help-
ing Hoosiers. Having served 32 years in 
public office, Connie was a champion 
for secure elections and the first 
woman to serve as majority floor lead-
er in the Indiana Senate. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Secretary 
Lawson for all the work she has done 
for the State of Indiana, and I wish her 
good luck on her future endeavors. 
MOUNT SURIBACHI 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in remembrance of the Battle of Iwo 
Jima 
and 
the 
taking 
of 
Mount 
Suribachi. 
On February 23, 1945, U.S. Marines 
were battling the Japanese to gain con-
trol of Iwo Jima. It was that day that 
Mount Suribachi was captured and the 
flag was raised for all to see. The Bat-
tle of Iwo Jima would become the dead-
liest battle in the United States Ma-
rine Corps history. Having visited Iwo 
Jima during my service, I will always 
remember those sacrifices of my fellow 
marines. 
Semper Fi. God bless the Marine 
Corps and the United States. Oorah. 
DEMOCRATS’ LATEST COVID BILL 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
because the Democrats’ newest pro-
posal is, yet again, a political state-
ment rather than a sincere effort at 
COVID relief. 
Last year’s CARES Act distributed 
money mainly by State population, but 
much of the $220 billion for States in 
the new bill will be allocated based on 
average unemployment over the 3- 
month period ending in December. 
In other words, States who fought 
COVID–19, took care of their small 
businesses, and helped their citizens 
stay afloat during the pandemic by 
being open are receiving less funds. 
Meanwhile, leftwing States—like New 
York, Illinois, and California—are get-
ting rewarded for crushing small busi-
nesses. 
Relief for hardworking Americans 
must be bipartisan, and it must be fair, 
end of story. 
MARCH MADNESS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Indiana on hosting 
March Madness this year. 
We are going to have divisions I, II, 
and III all over the State. We owe this 
opportunity and achievement to Gov-
ernor Holcomb and his great work lead-
ing our State through our fight with 
COVID. With our Nation’s eyes upon 
the Hoosier State, our deep-rooted his-
tory with basketball will be well-rep-
resented. 
Congratulations to the NCAA and In-
diana. It is sure to be an extraordinary 
tournament. 
f 
RECOGNIZING KAPPA RHO ZETA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the resilience of the resi-
dents in my district who have seen the 
traumatic impacts of the pandemic but 
they continue to show up for each 
other. 
The sisterhood among the women of 
the Zeta Phi Beta’s Highland Park 
Michigan chapter, Kappa Rho Zeta, in 
my district are a true testament to our 
community’s strength. This sorority 
was founded with the purpose of up-
holding the tenets of sisterhood and 
service. Over the past 40 years, the sis-
ters have given countless hours of com-
munity service to the people of High-
land Park. 
Their service and charity work has 
extended to so many organizations 
across my district. Even during some

of 
our 
district’s 
most 
challenging 
times, they continue to show up for our 
neighborhoods and community mem-
bers who are most vulnerable. They 
have spearheaded annual holiday cele-
brations 
for 
our 
seniors, 
provided 
workshops and assistance for pregnant 
mothers, and uplifted the graduating 
high school students of Highland Park 
by awarding scholarships to support 
them in their academic pursuits. 
This is our district’s strength. I am 
honored to uplift the 40 years of sister-
hood, service, and strength of the 
women of Zeta Phi Beta’s Kappa Rho 
Zeta Chapter and their many out-
standing contributions to the residents 
of Highland Park and 13th District 
Strong.

HONORING WAYNE COUNTY RESIDENTS LOST TO 
COVID–19 
Ms. TLAIB. The people define my dis-
trict and its history, so it is essential 
that I give reverence to the residents 
who are among the 500,000 people in the 
United States who lost their lives as a 
result of the coronavirus. 
I would like to honor a valuable 
member of the community who has 
passed, Ms. Abena Hogan. 
Ms. Hogan was born and raised in De-
troit and was a proud daughter of our 
community. 
She began her first career in public 
service working for southeast Michi-
gan’s regional public transit system. 
After 20 years of service, Ms. Hogan 
briefly retired before she was called 
back into service to work for our 
Wayne County Clerk. 
Ms. Hogan took immense pride in 
serving the people of Wayne County, 
and Ms. Hogan believed deeply in the 
power of the people and grassroots ac-
tion. She will be dearly, dearly missed. 
I also want to give tribute to a very 
highly respected public servant. This is 
Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon. 
He left a tremendous mark on our com-
munity and the community that he 
truly loved to serve. 
Benny Napoleon served as our Wayne 
County Sheriff from 2009 until the time 
of his death. His love for Detroit and 
its people was unwavering. His tenure 
as Wayne County Sheriff was marked 
by his work to reduce inmate popu-
lations by utilizing alternatives to in-
carceration and employing electronic 
tethering. 
Napoleon was well-known for his per-
sonality and his big heart, and he had 
a smile that would just light up a 
room. 
Shortly after his death, we lost yet 
another public servant in our district, 
Mayor Dan Paletko. 
Mayor Paletko served the Dearborn 
Heights community from 2004 until his 
death late last year. He prioritized 
making Dearborn Heights a welcoming 
place for all of its residents to call 
home and was especially proud of his 
city’s rich cultural diversity and rec-
reational resources. His pride in Dear-
born Heights was evident in his dedica-
tion. 
We will continue to honor the memo-
ries of not only the mayor, the sheriff, 
and Abena, but also the countless other 
residents of 13th District Strong who 
have lost their lives to this deadly dis-
ease. 
Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napo-
leon, Dearborn Heights Mayor Dan 
Paletko, and Abena Hogan are three of 
more than 16,000 Michigan residents 
who have lost their lives to COVID. 
It is essential that our families who 
have suffered such a great loss this 
past year get the resources and support 
they need from our government so that 
they do not face financial struggles and 
hardship because of the pandemic. 
We must act now. Our families and 
our communities can’t wait any longer. 
Our families deserve recurring pay-
ments. Our local communities deserve 
direct aid. Our residents deserve to be 
vaccinated, and our students deserve to 
be educated in a safe environment 
where they can not only learn but 
thrive. 
So today, I rise in remembrance of 
those we have lost due to COVID but 
lean on the strength and the resiliency 
of my district who deserves more. 
f 
STUDENT PHILANTHROPISTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
two students in my district, Penn-
sylvania’s 15th Congressional District, 
who have gone out of their way to bet-
ter their communities recently. After 
reading about their work, I felt that 
they deserved this recognition. 
Richard Clark is a student at Mount 
Aloysius College in Cresson, Pennsyl-
vania. Richard is an MBA student and 
decided to use a class project oppor-
tunity, assignment, as an opportunity 
to help the Keystone Regional Fire and 
Rescue Department. He helped the 
president of the fire department write 
an application, a grant application, 
that resulted in a $10,000 grant to ben-
efit that organization and, certainly, 
the citizens, families, and communities 
that that emergency service organiza-
tion serves. 
Before serving in Congress, I spent 
nearly 30 years as a State-certified vol-
unteer firefighter. It was an honor to 
serve my community, and I know first-
hand how big of a deal, how big of a dif-
ference those funds can make in a 
small-town company in a rural area. 
Dave Fulton, president of the fire com-
pany, said that the funds would be 
combined with support from the coun-
ty to purchase a new radio system. 
Richard’s 
professor, 
Dr. 
Leah 
Spangler offered high praise, saying: 
‘‘I’m just so happy to have a student 
who is so invested in an organization 
to really do this kind of work for them. 
It’s so much more than a grade for a 
class that you can do something so 
positive for the community.’’ 
I would like to thank Richard for his 
hard work, his dedication, and his com-
mitment to serving his community. 
In Indiana, Pennsylvania, a 17-year- 
old 
named 
Lily 
Palfrey 
recently 
reached the highest service level pos-
sible in 4–H by completing her Dia-
mond Clover project. 
Lily’s father, Sergeant Frank Pal-
frey, has spent more than 30 years with 
the Army National Guard, serving as 
the inspiration for her service project. 
She collected more than $9,000 in dona-
tions and sent more than 150 boxes 
filled with personal care items to our 
National Guard troops, our citizen war-
riors who are deployed overseas. 
Accompanying her service project is 
a video called ‘‘We Serve Too,’’ a pres-
entation that Lily developed through 
her church to share the stories of mili-
tary families. 
Though she has fulfilled her service 
project obligation, Lily continues to 
collect morale-boosting donations like 
board games, snacks, and coffee. 
I am encouraged by the kindness and 
the generosity of both Richard and 
Lily. Thank you to these two for their 
spirit of service. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CALVIN C. 
GOODE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Calvin C. 
Goode, a civil rights leader and long-
est-serving Phoenix City Council mem-
ber in the city’s history. 
Mr. GOODe passed away in December 
2020 at the age of 93, but his impact on 
Phoenix will be felt for generations to 
come. 
Calvin moved to Arizona with his 
family when he was just 10 months old, 
and later had to move across the State 
to find a high school that would enroll 
Black students. He eventually grad-
uated from Carver High School in 1945 
and went on to earn a master’s in edu-
cation from Arizona State University. 
In 1971, Calvin became only the sec-
ond Black American ever elected to the 
Phoenix City Council. In his 22 years 
on the council, Calvin advocated for 
historic preservation, affordable hous-
ing, more accessible neighborhoods, 
and educational programs such as Head 
Start. 
Calvin was married to his wife, 
Georgie Mae Goode, a Phoenix activist 
and educator, for 55 years. 
As we continue to celebrate Black 
History Month, I would like to recog-
nize and share my appreciation for Cal-
vin C. Goode’s commitment to the 
Black community in Phoenix and to 
advancing the lives of young people in 
the city. His spirit will be missed, and 
his leadership will be felt for years to 
come.

RECOGNIZING 
PARTNERSHIP 
BE-
TWEEN 
FLORIDA 
INTER-
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY AND THE 
JOHN S. AND JAMES L. KNIGHT 
FOUNDATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a transformational 
partnership 
announced 
in 
my 
districtbetween Florida International 
University and the John S. and James 
L. Knight Foundation. 
In what will become a national model 
for 
public-private 
collaboration 
to 
meet industry needs and further fuel 
the current momentum for technology 
and entrepreneurship in South Florida, 
the Knight Foundation has made a $10 
million gift and FIU a 10-year commit-
ment of $106 million to catalyze the de-
velopment of the local tech ecosystem. 
Today, FIU is Miami-Dade’s top 50 
public research university and is a top 
producer of minority graduates in 
STEM fields. This partnership will 
strengthen FIU’s standing, allowing for 
the doubling of computer science grad-
uates, researchers and making FIU a 
hub for research in artificial intel-
ligence, smart robotics, bioinformatics, 
biodevices, and digital forensics. 
I am proud of the work we did at the 
county level when I was the mayor of 
Miami-Dade County to make Miami 
and our South Florida communities a 
world-class destination for tech entre-
preneurs. The resources and support for 
accelerators, incubators, our colleges 
and universities, and all the places 
that serve as creation centers for inno-
vation through the use of technology 
has positioned South Florida as a lead-
er in the economy of the future. 
I look forward to everything this 
partnership 
between 
FIU 
and 
the 
Knight Foundation will do for our 
South Florida communities. 
f 
JAZZ & FRIENDS DAY OF SCHOOL 
AND COMMUNITY READINGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to participate in the HRC Foundation 
Welcoming Schools Jazz and Friends 
Day of School and Community Read-
ings. 
Each year, this day is meant to in-
spire caring community members to 
join together to affirm the rights of 
trans and non-binary youth and show 
support for LGBTQ children and youth 
to have safe, affirming, and welcoming 
schools and communities. 
To take part in this year’s readings, 
I am proud to stand on the floor of the 
U.S. House of Representatives to read 
from ‘‘When Aidan Became a Brother,’’ 
by author Kyle Lukoff: 
When Aidan was born, everyone thought he 
was a girl. His parents gave him a pretty 
name. His room looked like a girl’s room. 
And he wore clothes that other girls liked 
wearing. 
But as Aidan got bigger, he hated the 
sound of his name. He felt like his room be-
longed to someone else. And he always 
ripped or stained his clothes accidentally-on- 
purpose. 
Everyone thought he was just a different 
kind of girl. 
Some girls had rooms full of science ex-
periments and bug collections. 
Lots of girls didn’t wear dresses. 
But Aidan didn’t feel like any kind of girl. 
He was really another kind of boy. 
It was hard to tell his parents what he 
knew about himself, but it was even harder 
not to. 
It took everyone some time to adjust, and 
they learned a lot from other families with 
transgender kids like him. 
Aidan explored different ways of being a 
boy. He tried out lots of names until one 
stuck. They changed his bedroom into a 
place where he belonged. He also took much 
better care of his new clothes. 
Then one day, Mom and Dad had some-
thing to tell him. 
‘‘I’m going to have a baby,’’ Mom an-
nounced. 
‘‘A baby,’’ Aidan said? ‘‘Does that mean I 
get to be the big brother?’’ 
‘‘Of course,’’ said Dad, ruffling his hair. 
Aidan thought that being a big brother was 
an important job for a boy like him. He 
wanted to make sure this baby would feel 
understood right away. 
The baby needed clothes, so Aidan and his 
mom went shopping. There were so many 
choices! Would the baby like seahorses or 
penguins better? 
‘‘Are you having a boy or girl?’’ asked a 
lady. 
Aidan didn’t like it when people asked if he 
was a boy or a girl, and he hoped the baby 
couldn’t hear yet. He was glad when Mom 
just smiled and said, ‘‘I’m having a baby.’’ 
The baby’s room needed to be painted, so 
Aidan and his dad went to the hardware 
store. Dad chose a gallon of sky-blue paint, 
and Aidan added a puffy-cloud white. 
‘‘Are you excited for your new brother or 
sister?’’ asked the paint guy? 
‘‘I’m excited to be a big brother,’’ Aidan 
said. 
The paint guy looked confused. Aidan 
could tell that he wanted to ask a different 
question, and he was glad to have his dad 
there. 
The big rollers were fun to paint with. 
‘‘This room feels just like being outside,’’ 
Aidan exclaimed. He had always felt trapped 
in his bedroom before they fixed it, but his 
new sibling wouldn’t have to feel that way. 
‘‘You’re right,’’ said Dad. ‘‘Let’s make 
some shapes in the clouds.’’ 
Every baby needs a name. Aidan loved get-
ting to choose his own, but he remembered 
that it had been hard for his parents to let go 
of the name they gave him. He looked for 
names that could fit this new person no mat-
ter who they grew up to be. 
Babies needed someone to read to them, so 
Aidan practiced and practiced and practiced. 
Dad wanted to teach Aidan how to change 
diapers. ‘‘Um, maybe later,’’ said Aidan. He 
decided that picking flowers for his mom was 
more important. 
Two weeks before the baby’s due date, 
Aidan started to worry. Maybe he should 
have picked different clothes. The blue walls 
might be too bright. He wished he could ask 
the baby which name they liked best. 
Mom came to tuck him in. ‘‘Are you feel-
ing okay, sweetie?’’ she asked. 
Aidan put his hands over where he thought 
the baby’s ears would be. ‘‘Do you think the 
baby will be happy with everything?’’ he 
whispered. ‘‘I don’t want them to feel like I 
did when I was little, but what if I get every-
thing wrong? What if I don’t how to be a 
good big brother?’’ 
Mom hugged him tight. ‘‘When you were 
born, we didn’t know you were going to be 
our son. We made some mistakes, but you 
helped us fix them. And you taught us how 
important it is to love someone for exactly 
who they are. This baby is so lucky to have 
you, and so are we.’’ 
The next morning, Aidan found the boxes 
of his old baby pictures. He looked so dif-
ferent back then! It hadn’t been easy, but he 
liked the boy he was growing into. 
Maybe everything wouldn’t be perfect for 
this baby. Maybe he would have to fix mis-
takes he didn’t even know he was making. 
And maybe that was okay. 
Aidan knew how to love someone, and that 
was the most important part of being a 
brother.

REMEMBERING NOREEN REALE 
FALCONE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. KATKO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of my dear 
friend Noreen Reale Falcone, who 
passed away on February 6, just shy of 
her 84th birthday. 
Quite simply, Noreen led a remark-
able life. She was a lifelong educator, a 
passionate philanthropist, and a cher-
ished community leader who lived her 
life in service to others. 
A Syracuse native, Noreen started 
her career working as an elementary 
school teacher. There she developed a 
passion 
for 
helping 
young 
people 
achieve their dreams and become well- 
rounded adults who strive to make the 
world more just and humane. 
Even before she started teaching, No-
reen always focused on philanthropy. 
Her family recounted a time to me 
when she was a child and received a 
new bicycle for Christmas. Instead of 
keeping it for herself, she gave it to 
someone less advantaged than her. 
That is Noreen. 
In adulthood, she served on countless 
charitable 
boards, 
an 
incredible 
amount of boards that she was on. She 
also served as president of the board of 
trustees at Manlius Pebble Hill School 
and in a wide range of roles at her alma 
mater Le Moyne College. 
In recognition of Noreen’s contribu-
tions to education and her service to 
the community, in 1998, Le Moyne 
named its library the Noreen Reale 
Falcone Library. 
Beyond her love for education and 
philanthropy, Noreen was a devoted 
wife, mother, and grandmother. She 
leaves behind her beloved husband of 60 
years, Michael, better known as Mick-
ey, 4 kids, and 13 grandkids. She so 
loved her grandkids and her kids that 
she actually put statues in her yard so 
when they weren’t there in the later 
years, she could look out and be re-
minded of them when she sees these 
statues. That is the kind of person she 
was. 
She was also a woman of strong 
Catholic faith who was an active pa-
rishioner at St. Mary’s of the Lake in

Skaneateles and participated in service 
missions around the world. Remark-
ably, she was the first female ever 
elected president of the 900-plus-year- 
old order of the Knights of Malta, an 
incredible feat. 
Noreen will leave behind an enduring 
legacy that will live on through the 
many community works she cham-
pioned and the countless lives, includ-
ing mine, that she uplifted through her 
educational endeavors. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in hon-
oring the life and legacy of Noreen 
Falcone. May she rest in peace.

HONORING EARLINE AND CHUCK 
ROGERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. MRVAN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin, I would like to wish my daugh-
ter Genevieve a happy 18th birthday. 
It is with great respect and sincere 
admiration that I rise today to cele-
brate Black History Month and its 2021 
theme, ‘‘The Black Family: Represen-
tation, Identity, and Diversity.’’ 
This year’s theme reflects on the un-
wavering resilience of the Black family 
as a nurturing and loving foundation 
for Black excellence, even as it con-
tinues to face systemic racism and sig-
nificant disparities in our society. The 
Black family has positively impacted 
our Nation throughout its history, and 
it is important to acknowledge and af-
firm that Black history is American 
history. 
Today, I would like to take a mo-
ment to honor a Black family that has 
played an instrumental role in public 
service in Indiana, and that is the fam-
ily of former State Senator Earline 
Rogers and Earline’s late husband, 
Louis Charles ‘‘Chuck’’ Rogers. 
Chuck and Earline married in 1955 
and had two children, Keith and Dara, 
as well as many grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren. 
From 
working 
selflessly as a public schoolteacher to 
Earline’s decades of service in the Indi-
ana General Assembly, and Chuck hav-
ing been a dedicated firefighter and 
first responder, the Rogers family is an 
exemplary pillar of the northwest Indi-
ana community. 
In her pursuit for education, Earline 
graduated with honors and as senior 
class president from Roosevelt High 
School and later went on to earn both 
a bachelor and master of science in 
education from Indiana University. 
After earning her degrees, Earline’s 
early career included teaching in the 
Gary Community School Corporation 
and being an active member of the 
American 
Federation 
of 
Teachers, 
which subsequently encouraged her to 
run for office. 
Earline went on to serve in numerous 
roles during her time in public service 
and was one of Indiana’s most accom-
plished and effective legislators, work-
ing with all her colleagues, including 
my 
father, 
State 
Senator 
Frank 
Mrvan, in a bipartisan fashion to im-
prove the lives of all Hoosiers. 
One of her many accomplishments is 
her legislation to address child exploi-
tation. A decade ago, Indiana had the 
second highest rate of girls being sexu-
ally assaulted in grades 9 through 12, 
with Black and Latino students among 
the most vulnerable. These devastating 
statistics prompted Senator Rogers, 
along with my father and countless 
other advocates, to champion Heath-
er’s Law, which requires the Indiana 
Department of Education to develop a 
program for Indiana schools to better 
educate students about predators and 
sexual abuse. 
I am especially proud to note that 
when I was first beginning my career in 
public service, I had the opportunity to 
intern for Earline in the Indiana Gen-
eral Assembly. I am proud to call 
Earline one of my mentors. As a legis-
lator in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, I will continue to strive to be as 
dedicated as Earline in improving eco-
nomic opportunity and prosperity for 
all residents of northwest Indiana. 
I would also like to honor Chuck, 
who recently passed away, on Decem-
ber 7, 2020. He will be remembered as a 
loving father, a supportive husband, 
and a great public servant. 
Chuck attended East St. Louis High 
School in Illinois and went on to grad-
uate from Indiana University. After 
school, Chuck held several esteemed 
positions, including as a member of the 
U.S. Army, a high school sports coach, 
and a high school educator of Black 
studies. 
Chuck was also a dedicated fire-
fighter, as he eventually earned the 
title of fire battalion chief of the Gary 
Fire Department, where he served for 
40 years. 
Chuck also served as a precinct com-
mitteeman in Indiana’s Third State 
District, where he played an essential 
role in Earline’s career as a State sen-
ator. 
As we recognize and celebrate the 
contributions of the Rogers and others, 
we must also acknowledge and address 
the structural factors that continue to 
create challenges for the Black family. 
In the last year, the COVID–19 public 
health 
emergency 
and 
the 
tragic 
killings of George Floyd, Breonna Tay-
lor, and so many others have exposed 
these inequities. 
Regarding the pandemic, I would 
note that, regrettably, minorities ac-
count for more than 50 percent of all 
hospitalizations 
and 
deaths 
from 
COVID–19 in the United States. We 
must remedy the early governmental 
failures to distribute COVID–19 vac-
cines in an equitable manner to the 
communities that have suffered the 
most. 
Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Black 
History Month, let us recognize the in-
delible contributions of Black families 
to the strength of our communities as 
well as recommit ourselves to fighting 
the pernicious influence of systemic 
racism and ameliorating the ongoing 
harms experienced by too many Black 
families in our society. 
f 
SAYING NO TO H.R. 5 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 5, the non-
equality Equality Act. 
This legislation is not about pro-
moting equality but provides pref-
erential rights to some people at the 
expense of the rights of others. This 
bill is a blatant attempt to normalize 
and promote laws that are both unfair 
and dangerous to our society. 
H.R. 5 circumvents the bipartisan Re-
ligious Freedom Restoration Act, mak-
ing it illegal to oppose abortion and 
forcing taxpayers to fund abortion and 
healthcare professionals to perform 
abortions in violation of their sincerely 
held beliefs. 
H.R. 5 will also violate women’s right 
to privacy and safety by opening the 
door for predatory men to prey on 
them in the most vulnerable of places: 
in shelters, changing rooms, and show-
ers. 
It will strip parental rights by per-
mitting children to undergo life-alter-
ing sex changes without parental con-
sent, which is nothing short of child 
abuse. 
It will undermine both individuals’ 
and businesses’ faith-based convictions. 
Today, I proudly stand in defense of 
our women, our children, and people of 
faith by saying no to H.R. 5; no to bio-
logical males in women’s sports; no to 
biological males in women’s shelters, 
locker rooms, and showers; no to reli-
gious oppression of any kind; no to tax-
payer-funded 
abortion; 
and 
no 
to 
transgender medical treatments for 
children, which is child abuse. Yes, 
child 
abuse. 
Transgender 
medical 
treatments for children is child abuse. 
God help us, have we lost our ever- 
loving minds? Just think, think for a 
minute. 
I ask my colleagues to consider the 
threats this bill poses to their families, 
their communities, and join me in pro-
tecting and upholding our Constitution 
by opposing this shameful legislation, 
H.R. 5, that shows favoritism to some 
while trampling on the rights of oth-
ers.

HONORING HAWAIIAN LANGUAGE 
MONTH

Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
morning to honor Mahina ‘Olelo Ha-
waii, or Hawaiian Language Month. 
Colleagues, I have the wonderful 
privilege of being native Hawaiian. My 
culture has served as a guiding light 
throughout my entire life, a light that 
has survived because of the many

light and who protected our Native in-
digenous language. 
For Native Hawaiians and so many 
other indigenous peoples, our language 
is essential for our people to live and 
thrive. In fact, we have an ‘Olelo 
No’eau, a proverb, that says: ‘‘I ka 
‘olelo no ke ola; I ka ‘olelo no ka 
make.’’ ‘‘In the language rests life; in 
the language rests death.’’ 
Established in 1840, Hawaii’s public 
education system is the oldest west of 
the Mississippi. In fact, in the 19th cen-
tury, Hawaii was one of the most lit-
erate nations in the world, with over 90 
percent of the population able to read 
and write. 
January 17, 1893, is a date that is 
etched in the consciousness of almost 
every Hawaiian, the day the Hawaiian 
Kingdom was overthrown. At the time 
of the overthrow, our language was 
used in all sectors of society by all of 
the kingdom’s citizens, from our homes 
and schools to businesses and govern-
ment, and even the halls of justice. 
In 1896, just 3 years after the over-
throw, a law was enacted that stated: 
‘‘The English language shall be the me-
dium and basis of instruction in all 
public and private schools.’’ 
That one sentence dealt a smothering 
blow to our language. If you want to 
extinguish a people, you extinguish 
their language by taking it from the 
ears and mouths of future generations. 
You take it away from their children. 
Piece by piece, action by action, the 
racist provisional and republic govern-
ment and others with influence at-
tempted to stem the flow of oxygen to 
our ‘olelo Hawaii. But they could not 
extinguish our fire. 
While Hawaiian was relegated to use 
in isolated spaces, even perhaps to 
whispers in private, we spoke, and we 
spoke in Hawaiian. We kept the embers 
burning for nearly a century. 
How do you revive a language? The 
same way they tried to extinguish it. 
We share it with our children. Fire- 
keepers started private preschool lan-
guage nests, or Punana Leo, and in 
1978, Hawaiian became an official lan-
guage of the State. But it would take 
100 years to change that 1896 law ban-
ning Hawaiian in schools when, in 1986, 
K–12 Hawaiian language immersion was 
reestablished in Hawaii’s Department 
of Education. 
These early language pioneers con-
tinued to rebuild the fire, step by step, 
action by action. By the 1980s, we grad-
uated our first bachelor’s degrees in 
Hawaiian language. From less than 50 
Native speakers under the age of 18 to 
more than 25,000 now self-identifying as 
Hawaiian language speakers today, our 
fire still burns, and it is growing. 
It is no longer novel to hear Hawai-
ian spoken in our local coffee shops and 
our grocery stores, and my family 
proudly joins along fellow fire-keepers 
to stoke the ‘olelo Hawaii flame, as my 
daughters attend Hawaiian language 
schools Punana Leo ‘O Hilo and Ke 
Kula ‘o Nawahiokalani’opu’u. 
While I am filled with pride, Mr. 
Speaker, it comes with a mix of other 
emotions: disappointment at under-
funding; frustration at the lack of eq-
uity in government use of Hawaiian as 
an official language; and trepidation, 
knowing how close we came to having 
our language snuffed out. 
While 
I 
am 
encouraged 
by 
our 
progress, I know there is more work 
ahead. We must continue to raise up 
the languages of all of America’s first 
peoples. 
UNESCO states that a third of the 
world languages have fewer than 1,000 
speakers left. Language is essential to 
cultural diversity, and diversity is es-
sential to our shared humanity. 
While Mahina ‘Olelo Hawaii, or our 
month of celebrating Hawaiian lan-
guage, is coming to a close, we will 
continue to stoke the flames of ‘olelo 
Hawaii month by month, year by year, 
generation to generation because, Mr. 
Speaker, ‘‘I ka ‘olelo no ke ola; I ka 
‘olelo no ka make.’’ ‘‘In the language 
rests life; in the language rests death,’’ 
and our resolve is greater than ever to 
ensure that our languages will live on. 
‘‘E Ola Mau Ka ‘Olelo Hawaii a me na 
‘Olelo ‘Oiwi A Pau Loa.’’ ‘‘The Hawai-
ian language, and all indigenous lan-
guages, shall live.’’ Mahalo.

REMEMBERING WILLIAM ‘‘WILL’’ 
HOWARD INGRAM II 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
a great Georgian and a great American, 
William ‘‘Will’’ Howard Ingram II of 
Richmond Hill, who tragically passed 
away at the age of 43. 
Will lived a successful life and began 
his career in the military after re-
markably receiving appointments to 
all three of the United States service 
academies. He was a 1999 graduate of 
West Point. 
After he honorably served his coun-
try as an Army officer, Will went on to 
earn a graduate degree from the Uni-
versity of Washington. Following his 
Active Duty service, he went on to 
serve his country as an Army civilian 
for over 15 years. 
During that time, he served as the 
chief of master planning for the Army’s 
3rd Infantry Division for several years 
before he took on responsibility as the 
chief of operation and maintenance at 
Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Air-
field. 
Among all of his many accomplish-
ments, Will was most proud of his son, 
Gabe. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him, 
during this most difficult time. 
RECOGNIZING SHERIFF CLYDE SMITH 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the long-
est-serving public servant in Bryan 
County and a great American. Long-
time 
Bryan 
County 
Sheriff 
Clyde 
Smith recently retired after more than 
54 years in law enforcement. 
Sheriff Smith’s exceptional career 
was highlighted when he was presented 
with the key to the city of Richmond 
Hill by Mayor Russ Carpenter. The key 
to the city is the highest honor Rich-
mond Hill can give, and it was pre-
sented 
in 
recognition 
of 
Sheriff 
Smith’s honest and faithful service to 
the citizens of Richmond Hill and 
Bryan County. 
Sheriff Smith began his career in law 
enforcement in Savannah, Georgia, and 
he positively impacted every resident 
and business owner there from the 
start. He is a man marked by his brav-
ery and compassion, and he is the epit-
ome of a dedicated public servant. 
I would like to express my apprecia-
tion for the work Sheriff Smith did 
throughout his career, and I wish him 
the best as he begins his retirement. 
HONORING BETTY MINER 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
Betty Miner of Richmond Hill, who, 
sadly, passed away at the age of 87. 
Betty lived a remarkable life and 
touched countless lives. She was a life-
long resident of Richmond Hill and be-
came the first woman council member 
for the city in 1971. Betty also served 
as mayor pro tem. 
In addition to her work to lead and 
improve Richmond Hill, she served on 
the DNR board for the State of Geor-
gia, for which she was instrumental in 
bringing 
the 
fisherman’s 
co-op 
to 
Bryan County. 
Through every position she had, she 
worked to better her community and 
every life she touched. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
her family, friends, and all who knew 
her, during this most difficult time. 
RECOGNIZING FORD AVENUE HISTORIC DISTRICT 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the Ford 
Avenue Historic District in an offi-
cially designated area in the city of 
Richmond Hill. 
After 2 years of planning, the Rich-
mond Hill City Council approved an 
amendment to an ordinance creating 
the city’s first historic district on Jan-
uary 5. 
The Ford Avenue Historic District is 
at the heart of Richmond Hill’s history 
and contains primary locations and 
buildings Ford Motor Company built 
between 1925 and 1947. 
When Henry Ford came to Richmond 
Hill, the town was known as Ways Sta-
tion. Upon his arrival, the town grew 
and become known as Richmond Hill. 
You can feel the history simply walk-
ing down the street. 
Mr. Speaker, designating this re-
markable historic district is just an-
other positive effort by the city to pro-
mote, protect, and remember its roots. 
I am thankful for the Richmond Hill 
City Council’s diligent work on this 
and everything they do.

February 25, 2021 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to strongly and fervently de-
nounce hate crimes in any form any-
where in America. 
Since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, this country has witnessed a 
shocking rise in hate crimes against 
Asians and Asian Americans. Between 
the onset of the pandemic to the end of 
last year, there have been over 2,800 re-
ported incidents of racism and dis-
crimination against Asian Americans. 
In New York City, an Asian woman 
was waiting in line at a bakery when 
she was brutally pushed to the ground, 
hitting her head. On the New York City 
subway, racial slurs have been uttered 
toward Asian riders and seniors have 
been physically attacked. In fact, in 
2020, the NYPD reported that 10 per-
cent of all bias attacks were targeted 
towards Asians. That is a ninefold in-
crease over the incidents probed in 
2019. 
I am proud to represent New York 
City’s Chinatown on the lower east side 
of Manhattan and Brooklyn’s China-
town around 8th Avenue in Sunset 
Park. 
On February 12, I joined so many oth-
ers in welcoming in the Lunar New 
Year, the Year of the Ox. But this year, 
a dark undercurrent and collective 
anxiety around the rise in violence 
dampened the celebrations. 
It goes without saying that my con-
stituents and every one of our con-
stituents ought to be able to go to 
work, walk to the grocery store, or ride 
public transportation without fear of a 
bigoted and even dangerous attack. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not who we are 
as a nation. We do not let xenophobia, 
racism, and violence run rampant on 
our streets, in our cities, in our hearts. 
No. We take pride in our diversity. We 
understand that what brings us to-
gether is far greater than what divides 
us. And we need to bring justice to all 
the victims of these heinous crimes. 
I am glad that in New York City, our 
mayor has created the Asian Hate 
Crime Task Force, and I encourage 
other cities and localities to take simi-
lar action. 
We also need a sustained Federal 
presence to combat and prevent hate 
crimes. That is why in the past I have 
introduced legislation to allocate $50 
million in Federal funds to help pre-
vent, track, and prosecute hate crimes 
and assist victims. I look forward to re-
introducing this bill. 
I was also proud to cosponsor my col-
league, Representative GRACE MENG’s, 
resolution to denounce the anti-Asian 
sentiment that has occurred since the 
outbreak of the coronavirus. 
Every one of us, everyone, has a re-
sponsibility to condemn and speak out 
against these attacks.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT 
COMMANDER MICHAEL J. HALL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MOORE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the contributions 
of Lieutenant Commander Michael J. 
Hall to his community, country, and 
the fight against COVID–19. 
Service to one’s country is rarely 
convenient, particularly not for a fa-
ther of four with a thriving orthopedic 
surgery practice. Yet, in September 
2019, Dr. Hall overcame adversity to 
join the Navy Reserve at the age of 48. 
Earlier that year, one of Mike’s boys 
showed interest in joining the Navy. A 
concerned father, Dr. Hall wanted to 
speak directly to the recruiter. By the 
end of the call, he inquired about join-
ing himself. 
Just 6 months after his commis-
sioning, Dr. Hall was given 36 hours’ 
notice to voluntarily deploy to hard- 
hit New York City, wearing the only 
uniform he had without having even 
completed his basic officer training. 
While many of us were scrambling to 
buy toilet paper, Dr. Hall fought an un-
known virus in a makeshift ICU unit 
with dozens of intubated patients. 
Now a seasoned veteran of this pan-
demic with a deployment under his

RESCUE AMERICANS NOW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of the American Rescue Plan. 
This past January marked 1 year since 
the first case of coronavirus was found 
in the United States. In my home State 
of Alabama, nearly 10,000 people have 
contracted COVID–19 and almost 9,000 
have died, and over half a million of 
the workers have filed for unemploy-
ment. 
We know that the effects of this pan-
demic 
have 
disproportionately 
im-
pacted our communities of color and 
low-income workers, who are more 
likely to be frontline workers and less 
likely to be able to afford access to 
quality healthcare. 
Thankfully, because of the leadership 
of the new Biden administration, we re-
cently witnessed a record drop in 
COVID cases and hospitalizations in 
Alabama; and with over 815,000 vaccine 
doses administered in our State, hope 
is finally on the horizon. 
That said, we have a long way to go 
before there are enough of the vaccines 
available to our communities to be 
really safe from the virus. 
As this pandemic continues, I know 
Alabama families are struggling to 
make ends meet. 
The time for decisive action is now. I 
strongly support the American Rescue 
Plan because it will not only crush the 
virus, but also help us to get back to 
schools safely, as well as to provide 
emergency financial support to strug-
gling families and small businesses. 
First, the President’s American Res-
cue Plan will create a national vac-
cination program that will make sure 
that underrepresented communities are 
not left behind. The bill also ramps up 
testing and contact tracing, increases 
the supply of critically needed PPE, 
and makes healthcare more accessible 
by enhancing the Advanced Premium 
Tax Credit. 
That was so important to so many 
Americans who could not afford other-
wise to purchase quality healthcare 
coverage. This is critical in a non-Med-
icaid expansion State like Alabama, 
where people have fewer available 
healthcare coverage options. 
Secondly, the American Rescue Plan 
delivers immediate financial relief to 
working families. This bill would pro-
vide critically needed $1,400 economic 
assistance checks to individuals so we 
can help families recover and cover the 
costs 
of 
necessary 
expenses, 
like 
childcare, groceries, rent, utilities, and 
so much more. 
I also fought to ensure that the un-
employment insurance was extended 
and expanded to $400 a week from $300 
a week. This is so important. When we 
think about the fierce urgency of now, 
we know that the unemployment, the 
Federal pandemic unemployment in-
surance benefits will actually expire 
March 14 if we do not act. That is why 
it is so incredibly important that we 
here in Congress do our part. 
I also worked with my colleagues in 
the Ways and Means Committee to en-
sure that the American Rescue Plan in-
cludes important provisions for our 
most vulnerable families. I am proud 
that the package includes an addi-
tional $7.6 million in childcare funding 
for the State of Alabama, which will 
help our frontline and hourly workers, 
who have been our true heroes in this 
pandemic. 
Furthermore, the package provides 
over $10 million for Alabama through a 
TANF pandemic emergency fund so 
that families with necessary emer-
gency needs get the essentials that are 
so necessary for their survival. 
I am especially proud this bill will 
also include lifesaving expansion to 
child tax credit and earned income tax 
credit, and I have championed that for 
many years. In my district alone, 53 
percent of the children do not receive 
the full benefits of this credit because 
it is not fully refundable. We will make 
it fully refundable and we will expand 
it, lifting millions of children out of 
poverty.

This bill also provides direct support 
to local government, cities, and coun-
ties directly who have not benefited 
from their States directly. This is 
critically important to small commu-
nities and large communities all across 
this Nation. 
Finally, the American Rescue Plan 
supports our small businesses and our 
frontline workers in our minority com-
munities. In this bill, we expand PPP 
eligibility and we provide critical re-
sources to our frontline healthcare 
workers, transit workers, and teachers. 
b 1100 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
economists 
and 
healthcare experts agree, if we do not 
take bold action now, we will have 
more deaths later and risk an economic 
downturn. 
Mr. Speaker, I am asking my col-
leagues, both Republicans and Demo-
crats, to listen to President Biden’s 
call for bipartisanship and pass this 
bill. 
I am reminded during this Black His-
tory Month of the powerful words of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, who said, ‘‘We 
must use time creatively, in the knowl-
edge that the time is always ripe to do 
right.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, let’s pass this package 
so that we can begin to Build Back 
Better and reassure our constituents 
that help is indeed on the way. 
f 
FUND LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC 
HEALTH WORKFORCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
in the coming days, the House is ex-
pected to vote on a $1.9 trillion spend-
ing bill that the majority claims will 
help fight the COVID–19 crisis. Despite 
this massive price tag, less than one- 
half of 1 percent of those dollars in this 
bill will go to fund a local and State 
public health workforce. 
As a former director of the Iowa De-
partment of Public Health, I have seen 
firsthand the great work our local pub-
lic health departments do, and I know 
how necessary they are in this fight 
against COVID–19. It is unthinkable to 
me that any so-called COVID relief bill 
will dedicate such a miniscule portion 
of its funding to local public health de-
partments, the same departments that 
are in our community, with us every 
day, working around the clock to de-
feat this pandemic. In contrast, FEMA 
is allocated $50 billion, and they have 
no medical personnel to dispense vac-
cines. 
Mr. Speaker, if we are serious about 
defeating this virus, I urge my col-
leagues to prioritize our public health 
officials and those on the frontline 
against COVID–19, instead of directing 
billions of dollars to programs and ini-
tiatives unrelated to this crisis. 
This funding should go as a pass-
through to the CDC and directly to 
noncompetitive, local public health 
grants. 
In our 99 counties in Iowa, local pub-
lic health officials are intelligent, ex-
perienced, and capable to dispense vac-
cines in a rapid and efficient process. 
They have proven their capabilities by 
setting up drive-through clinics for flu 
vaccines, and also in the H1N1 pan-
demic as well. And given their pre-
paredness training, they have worked 
with our local emergency management 
associates to do drive-through testing. 
These are the same nurses and individ-
uals who live in your communities and 
who have vaccinated your children and 
have been the source of information 
and calm and support throughout this 
crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s work together to 
defeat this virus by supporting our 
State and local public health teams by 
getting them the funding they need di-
rectly to them at the community level 
through noncompetitive, local public 
health grants. Acknowledging the tre-
mendous work that our local public 
health workforce does on a daily basis 
and funding their efforts will defeat 
this virus and get America back on its 
feet. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PACKAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
none of us can rise to the floor of the 
House and talk about the cruciality of 
the American Rescue package and the 
absolute imperative nature of this par-
ticular legislation passing without ac-
knowledging 500,000 lives—not num-
bers, but names of mothers and fathers, 
grandmothers and grandfathers, aunts 
and uncles and cousins, sisters and 
brothers, just plain good friends, and 
loved ones that extend beyond one’s 
family. And then for the love of this 
country, just our fellow Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, these are hardworking 
people, many of them essential workers 
on the front lines. Unfortunately, with 
the horrific and insulting effort that 
was made by the last administration, 
essential workers were out and about 
in grocery stores and delivery trucks, 
first responders, and no one attempted 
to stop the community spread. We had 
no testing protocol, and it was in my 
Congressional district that I worked 
with United Memorial Hospital to en-
sure that we had testing sites and 
opened the first testing site in my Con-
gressional district to reach hard-to- 
serve areas on March 19. 
Mr. Speaker, since that time, we 
have done 55 with UMMC, a small hos-
pital that I call, ‘‘the little red engine 
that can.’’ But that was all done by the 
energy and determination in a city 
that was clearly one of the hotspots as 
part of the State of Texas, complete in-
ertia by our leadership until we began 
to see the high numbers of loss of life 
in the African-American and Latinx 
community. 
Mr. Speaker, I am on the floor today 
to reinforce my continued and em-
phatic support for the American Res-
cue Plan, because I don’t see the 500,000 
lives as just numbers, I see them as 
persons who are in need. 
This plan will mount a national vac-
cination program that includes setting 
up community vaccination sites na-
tionwide. It will also take complemen-
tary measures to combat the virus, in-
cluding scaling up testing and tracing, 
addressing shortages of personal pro-
tective equipment—a real fight against 
COVID–19 and all of its variants, in-
cluding the UK, South Africa, and one 
that is just starting up. It delivers im-
mediate relief to working families. It 
will give the $1,400—that will make it 
$2,000, increase in the minimum wage 
as well, and continued unemployment. 
Mr. Speaker, let me cite the city of 
Houston, that we have lost jobs in 9 
key service sectors: 
Healthcare, 391,000 jobs lost; retail, 
303,600 jobs lost; food services, 267,000 
jobs lost; finance, 166,000; private edu-
cation, 63,000; art and entertainment 
37,000-plus; 
accommodations, 
$28,000; 
air transportation, $20,200. 
One of the reasons my motion passed 
in the Budget Committee to ensure the 
protection of the public funding where 
Harris County will receive $141 billion 
plus. The city of Houston will receive 
$141 billion plus, because we are des-
perate to provide these dollars for our 
public resources, our municipal work-
ers, our healthcare workers, our fire-
fighters, our paramedics, our law en-
forcement, police. We are all in need to 
continue this fight. We need this 
money to support struggling commu-
nities, as indicated with the loss of jobs 
in Houston and Harris County. 
Mr. Speaker, the plan will provide 
crucial support for the hardest hit 
small businesses, and I am glad we 
have worked to target these small busi-
nesses, especially those owned by en-
trepreneurs from racial and ethnic 
backgrounds that experienced systemic 
discrimination, 
along 
with 
EIDL 
grants that my faith communities and 
nonprofits are asking about, and as 
well, the expanded eligibility for those 
entities and resources for jobs, to pro-
tect the jobs of first responders, as I in-
dicated. 
Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear: We 
are hard hit. If we do not pass the 
American Rescue Plan, which I intend 
to support enthusiastically, we will end 
up with 4 million fewer jobs. It will 
take us more than a year to return to 
full employment. We will lower the 
lifetime earnings of our young genera-
tion. Millions of parents, particularly 
mothers—women have been hurt by 
this even more—will be forced to stay 
at home, and another 4 years of suf-
fering before real returns come. 
Mr. Speaker, we had to experience 
this, but we are not going to continue 
to experience it. Let’s support the 
American Rescue Plan as the Biden ad-
ministration has asked us to do.

February 25, 2021 
EQUAL PROTECTION AND RIGHTS 
FOR ALL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the Equality Act, 
long overdue legislation to continue 
the progress made under the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing 
Act, the Equal Opportunity Act, and 
other vital laws that prohibit discrimi-
nation on the basis of race, color, reli-
gion, sex or national origin. 
These civil rights laws were passed to 
provide critical protections for people 
who unnecessarily live in fear and were 
unfairly persecuted simply because of 
who they were. They were passed be-
cause the promise of America—equal 
treatment under the law—was non-
negotiable. It is still nonnegotiable. 
So with the Equality Act, we must 
take the next step to guarantee equal 
protection and rights under the law for 
all, no matter who you love or your 
gender identity. The Equality Act 
seeks to stamp out discrimination 
against the LGBTQIA community— 
something that we, unfortunately, see 
far too often. 
Mr. Speaker, no one should face dis-
crimination in employment, housing, 
education, public space, or federally 
funded programs because of who they 
are or who they love. I am proud to be 
an ally of the LGBTQIA community 
and have worked to advance these 
rights and protections with groups and 
individuals throughout my career in 
public service, including hiring an out, 
HIV positive, gay man to serve as my 
first Congressional chief of staff. 
In 1986, while serving on the New 
York City Council, I introduced the 
first bill to legally recognize same-sex 
partnerships in New York State his-
tory, and I had to threaten the city of 
New York to even get the bill printed. 
City officials said the bill was uncon-
stitutional and could not even be print-
ed. And while we have made great 
progress—the bill was printed and 
passed since then—we still have work 
to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud that New 
York State recently enacted legisla-
tion to repeal the ‘‘walking while 
trans’’ ban, but we must ensure that 
the LGBTQIA community has these 
protections 
and 
equal 
rights 
all 
throughout the country. Access to 
equal rights should not depend on your 
ZIP Code. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to join me today in voting to pass the 
Equality Act so that every American, 
regardless of who they love has equal 
protection under the law. 
f 
HONORING THE DIVINE NINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. KELLY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
as Black History Month comes to an

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Test our hearts today, O God. 
May the clashes we endure and the 
roadblocks we encounter serve like a 
crucible for silver, that in the midst of 
these ordeals, You would rid us of ugli-
ness, wrongful attitudes, and hurtful 
ways. 
In the heat of our arguments and in 
the intensity of our discussions, refine 
us as a furnace does gold. 
Remove from us our long-held griev-
ances and free us from our unseemly 
behaviors. 
Purify our thoughts of corrosive in-
tent. Then forge us, that we would be 
molded and shaped to Your will and 
useful to the common good. 
Into Your hands, O God, we yield our 
spirits and in the strength of Your 
name, we offer our prayers. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

SUPPORT THE EQUALITY ACT 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the 
LGBTQ-plus 
community 
throughout 
Chicagoland and Illinois in support of 
the Equality Act. 
While we have come a long way in 
the fight for equality through the Su-
preme Court’s decisions on recognizing 
the marriage of same-sex couples in 
Obergefell v. Hodges, and protecting 
workplace rights for the LGBTQ-plus 
community in Bostock v. Clayton 
County, it is time to codify protections 
into law. 
The Equality Act would amend the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and extend ex-
isting nondiscrimination laws to en-
sure that LGBTQ-plus individuals are 
treated equally in all facets of their 
life. 
In 2021, it is unconscionable that 
LGBTQ-plus people continue to face 
harassment and outright discrimina-
tion 
while 
attempting 
to 
access 
healthcare, housing, and employment 
opportunities. 
It is past time that Congress pass 
legislation so that all people, no mat-
ter your race, color, creed, or sexu-
ality, are treated equally under the law 
in this country. 
I rise as an ally in support of the 
Equality Act because no one should be 
discriminated against for who they 
love or who they are. 
f 
CONGRATULATING 
THE 
LURAY 
BULLDOGS GIRLS BASKETBALL 
TEAM 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Luray Bulldogs 
Girls Basketball Team who won the 
Virginia Class 2 State championship 
this weekend. 
After falling just short to Gate City 
in last year’s state title game, the 
Lady Bulldogs were ready to enact 
their revenge in Saturday’s rematch. 
It was a nail-biter of a game as the 
two teams traded leads heading into 
the fourth quarter. And with just a 
minute and 40 seconds remaining, the 
game was tied at 54 apiece. 
Following back-to-back steals and 
uncontested layups by senior, Brynlee 
Burrill, the Lady Bulldogs pulled ahead 
by four and maintained their lead. 
When all was said and done, Luray had 
avenged their previous loss to Gate 
City with a 61–56 victory. This win 
capped off a perfect 13–0 season and was 
the first State title in the program’s 
history. 
The team has had a remarkable 2 
years, with an overall record of 42–2; 
and after battling obstacles all season, 
the win shows true toughness, deter-
mination, and resiliency. 
Congratulations to Coach Lucas and 
the entire Lady Bulldogs squad on this 
incredible achievement. 
f 
INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND 
HELP OUR NEIGHBORS 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, 
all across the country, including my 
home district in Ventura County in 
California, Americans continue to feel 
the overwhelming burden of the ongo-
ing COVID–19 pandemic. 
I regularly hear from small busi-
nesses fighting to keep their doors 
open; from parents struggling to put 
food on the table after losing their 
jobs; and from people who live in fear 
of being evicted from their homes. It is 
imperative that we invest in our com-
munities and help our neighbors now. 
With money specifically dedicated 
for vaccine development and distribu-
tions, testing, the production of PPE, 
more relief for small businesses, and 
additional aid for the unemployed and 
struggling families, passage of the 
American Rescue Plan is critical to en-
suring economic recovery, getting our 
kids back to school, providing relief to 
small businesses and, most impor-
tantly, saving lives. 
My Republican colleagues went big 
when it came to massive corporate tax 
cuts. It would be incomprehensible 
that we nickel and dime working fami-
lies and small businesses during the 
worst pandemic in over a century.

DEEP FLAWS OF THE DEMOCRAT 
COVID BILL 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the legislation that we are scheduled to 
consider on the floor tomorrow, the so- 
called American Rescue Plan. 
The sad truth, Madam Speaker, is 
that this bill does very little to address 
the real issues impacting communities 
across the country. Instead, the major-
ity has elected to weaponize the rec-
onciliation process to push through a 
Democrat wish-list of what are, frank-
ly, left-wing policies. 
Only 9 percent of this bill actually 
goes to combating COVID. But Demo-
crats have found the wisdom to insert 
$510 billion to bail out poorly run blue 
States; $470 billion-plus for a policy 
that we know will kill jobs; a $100 mil-
lion earmark for a rail project in the 
Speaker’s district; a $1.5 million ear-
mark for a bridge to Canada for the 
Senate majority leader. All the while, 
there is still $1 trillion in unspent 
funds from previous COVID packages. 
Madam Speaker, these are just a few 
of the many deep flaws in the Demo-
crat COVID bill, and I am grateful so 
many of my colleagues are coming for-
ward to help highlight the short-
comings of this bill, and how we should 
move forward to best serve the Amer-
ican people. 
I urge everyone to oppose this mon-
strosity.

DELIVERING ON PROMISED COVID– 
19 RELIEF 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
in December, this House passed a 
COVID–19 relief compromise, during 
which time we pledged to the American 
people that we would do more. Now is 
the time for us to deliver on that prom-
ise. 
The American Rescue Plan is that 
promise delivered. It is something that 
enables us to put people back to work; 
put kids back in schools; to put $1,400

checks in people’s hands, the people 
who are struggling to keep body and 
soul together, to make ends meet, the 
people who really need this money. 
No American economist of repute dis-
agrees that this kind of relief is nec-
essary. Now is the time for us to do it. 
Let’s come together and enact the 
American Rescue Plan.

REVERSAL OF OPERATION TALON 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, ever since President 
Biden has taken office, he has been 
laser-focused 
on 
overturning 
every 
great initiative from the previous ad-
ministration, regardless of how good it 
was for the American people. 
Today, I want to shed light on Presi-
dent Biden’s tragic reversal of Oper-
ation Talon. Operation Talon was a 
program run by U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement to capture ille-
gal alien sex offenders in America and 
deport them. 
Sex offenders commit some of the 
most 
unspeakable 
and 
despicable 
crimes imaginable. We monitor where 
they are in the United States when 
those individuals are here legally. Now 
we have no idea where they are when 
they are here illegally. 
Biden’s misguided reversal threatens 
the physical and mental health of 
American children and their families. 
Even setting aside the debate about 
illegal immigration, we should all be 
able to agree that sex offenders who 
are in this country illegally should be 
deported. 
Of all things that are common sense 
and bipartisan, we should agree that 
sex offenders are criminals and are a 
risk to our citizens. To not deport 
these individuals just because the 
present administration wants to erase 
the last administration is unconscion-
able. 
I strongly urge President Biden’s re-
versal of Operation Talon and urge him 
to reinstate it immediately. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF VALERIE 
WARD 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember a community lead-
er, a constituent, and a friend, Ms. Val-
erie Ward, who passed away January 6, 
at the age of 80. 
Ms. Ward devoted her life in service 
to others, as president of the Willow 
Grove branch of the NAACP, and as an 
Abington PAL board member. 
Val had the heart of a teacher, spend-
ing her time mentoring younger gen-
erations well into her own retirement. 
Clipboard in hand, Val could be found 
most weekends spearheading commu-
nity events, always leading by exam-
ple. 
Val was a woman of great faith, lead-
ing several ministries at her beloved 
New Bethel AME. As a life member of 
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, she was 
proud to share her sisterhood with Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS. 
She was known for her direct, no 
nonsense approach and her dry sense of 
humor, warm smile, and infectious 
laugh. 
I join Ms. Val’s family, friends, and 
the wider Abington community in 
mourning the loss of an incredible 
woman. The world is a better place for 
her life. 
f 
PELOSI-SCHUMER PARTISAN 
PAYOFF TO PROGRESSIVES ACT 
(Mr. CARL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to voice my opposition to the 
reckless spending plan being pushed 
through this Congress. This so-called 
COVID relief bill is nothing more than 
a liberal wish list of special-interest 
pork completely unrelated to COVID 
relief. 
With more than $1 trillion of pre-
vious COVID relief funds remaining 
unspent, it would be irresponsible to 
rush 
through 
a 
massive, 
partisan 
spending bill that does nothing to help 
the American workers or get our kids 
physically back into school. Our prior-
ities should be reopening our economy, 
getting students physically back in 
school, and spending more for our vac-
cine distribution. 
COVID relief should be temporary, 
targeted and tied to COVID. But this 
plan does nothing of the sort. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to the $1.9 tril-
lion spending boondoggle that is going 
to be on the House floor this week. 
While there are many irresponsible 
and careless facets of this bill worth 
noting, the elimination of alternative 
wage programs for workers with dis-
abilities is one of the most devastating 
aspects of this bill, impacting over 
5,800 Missourians and thousands more 
across our Nation. 
In fact, this provision will likely 
cause the end of these programs. By 
doing that, it will strip many individ-
uals of their voice, workplace family, 
independence, and sense of community. 
That is why I am offering an amend-
ment to protect the choices and voices 
of the Missourians next to me. They 
deserve a government that supports 
their efforts, not one that runs them 
out of business. 
With only 35 percent of individuals 
with disabilities employed in the com-
petitive market, it is our duty to look 
for ways to expand employment oppor-
tunities for them, not diminish them. I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment and, if it does not pass, 
please oppose this bill.

RECOGNIZING SAKA NANKANA 
SAHIB 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today as the co-chair of the Amer-
ican Sikh Congressional Caucus to rec-
ognize and create national awareness 
about the Saka Nankana Sahib mas-
sacre. 
The Sikh community across the 
world is observing 100 years of this hor-
rific event. The massacre refers to the 
grim episode during the Gurdwara Re-
form Movement in which a peaceful 
batch of reformist Sikhs was subjected 
to a murderous assault on February 20, 
1921, in the holy Gurdwara at Nankana 
Sahib, the birthplace of the founder of 
the Sikh religion, Guru Nanak. 
More than 260 Sikhs were killed, in-
cluding children as young as 7. Sikhs 
pay tribute to all those martyred on 
this day. Their valor and sacrifice will 
never be forgotten. Their memory in-
spires us to work even harder to voice 
for religious freedom and the right of 
worship.

CELEBRATING NATIONAL FFA 
WEEK 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate National FFA Week. 
FFA is a national leader in agricul-
tural education, inspiring our Nation’s 
young people to pursue careers that 
help support a robust rural economy. 
Agriculture is rooted in American 
heritage, and our Nation’s producers 
provide the food, the fiber, and the en-
ergy that we all depend on. 
Agriculture is science. It is tech-
nology. It is innovation. And the young 
men and women of the FFA are helping 
to shape the industry’s future. 
Every time I see a distinctive blue 
FFA jacket, I am reminded of the 
strong character and impressive leader-
ship abilities that come along with it. 
FFA leaders have gone on to become 
Ivy League graduates, Federal court 
judges, innovative farmers, famous per-
formance artists, and even U.S. Presi-
dents. 
This week, we celebrate the impor-
tant success of FFA, and we look for-
ward to what FFA leaders have in store 
for the future of rural America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H632 
February 25, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Kathie Green, a 
member of my staff and a trailblazer in 
the field of constituent services. 
Kathie will be retiring next week 
after 13 years of service to northeast 
Indiana and the congressional office of 
the Third District. She was originally 
hired by former Congressman Mark 
Souder. She worked for former Con-
gressman Marlin Stutzman and has 
worked for me for my entire time in 
Congress as well. 
More than anything, Kathie has an 
uncommon passion for helping others 
in need, and that passion was perhaps 
most evident during the initial out-
break of the coronavirus last year. She 
made hundreds of phone calls every 
week to help those who needed it most 
during a very difficult time, and that is 
what she did for 13 years. 
Today, I want to pay tribute to her 
for her distinguished career in service 
to our district. Thank you, Kathie 
Green. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS ON 
THE RIGHT TRACK 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to thank President Joe Biden, the first 
President I have ever noted that asked 
for a review of America’s supply chain 
for manufactured goods. It grew out of 
his interest in the pandemic and the 
fact we couldn’t supply our ventilators, 
our face masks, our gloves, all the pro-
tective equipment for our healthcare 
workers. 
He is on the right track because all 
of that has been outsourced. I think 
one of the reasons we can’t get vac-
cines at the level we need is because 
the ingredients have been outsourced. 
America needs to bring back industry 
here. 
Today’s New York Times has a story, 
‘‘In China, an Electric Car Maker Loses 
Money but Thinks Big,’’ and I com-
mend this story to the Biden adminis-
tration and everyone who is listening. 
We have to have a fair playing field 
globally in order to maintain manufac-
turing in this country because places 
like China play under the table. They 
have vehicles that lose money in the 
marketplace, but it is a state-run econ-
omy, and they will subsidize what they 
have to in order to win that market 
share. 
Congratulations, 
President 
Biden, 
you are on the right track. 
f 
NOT TARGETED COVID RELIEF 
(Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to a massive 
spending bill filled with payoffs to pro-
gressives. 
We should be focused on defeating 
COVID, getting Americans back to 
work, and helping small business re-
cover. Instead, House Democrats are 
tossing bipartisanship aside to ram 
through a one-sided $1.9 trillion bill. 
We need a full accounting of the $1 
trillion in existing COVID relief that 
hasn’t even been spent before asking 
taxpayers to foot the bill for trillions 
more. 
And this isn’t even emergency relief. 
Less than 10 percent is for actually 
fighting COVID. The rest will only 
make it harder for small business to re-
cover, hire workers, and rebuild our 
economy. 
On top of that, it is a massive bailout 
for fiscally irresponsible cities and 
States. Put simply, Hoosiers should 
not have to pay for the bad decisions of 
progressives in California. 
This is not the unity President Biden 
called for. It is not the bipartisanship 
Americans expect. It is certainly not 
the targeted COVID relief our country 
needs. 
f 
AMERICA’S GREAT TRAUMATIC 
EXPERIENCE 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, yester-
day, we had a Judiciary Committee 
meeting on the rise of white nation-
alism and the concerns it should pose 
to our country. 
It was a pertinent meeting, and I was 
shocked to hear some of the remarks of 
my colleagues on the Republican side 
who still have not accepted the fact 
that what happened on January 6 was 
an attack on our Constitution that 
they take an oath to and an attack on 
our country. They seem to think it was 
just a demonstration, a small, polite 
demonstration of 200 people; that it 
was, some said, people other than 
Trump people posing as Trump people. 
Those were Trump people. They wore 
Trump hats. They had Trump flags. 
They hollered ‘‘Trump.’’ They were 
there to stop the steal for Trump. 
America faced a great traumatic ex-
perience, as I did being in this Chamber 
on January 6, and I ask my Republican 
colleagues to accept it, accept the fact 
that it was a big lie, and Joe Biden is 
the properly, lawfully elected Presi-
dent of the United States. 
f 
ANOTHER MASSIVE WASTE OF 
MONEY 
(Mr. FALLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, the 
COVID relief bill, which Democrats 
want to pass and spend $1.9 trillion, is 
not about COVID or relief. Sadly, it is 
just another massive waste of taxpayer 
dollars. 
Here is the proof: 91 percent of this 
money doesn’t even go to fighting 
COVID, and the bill isn’t bipartisan. 
There were 229 amendments by Repub-
licans, 99 percent of which were re-
jected. 
This so-called American Rescue Plan 
includes $750 million for global health 
activities outside our country. It also 
includes $135 million for the National 
Endowment for the Arts, $135 million 
for the National Endowment for the 
Humanities, $50 million for an increase 
in Planned Parenthood, $60 billion for 
union pension bailout, and a $350 bil-
lion bailout for mismanaged Demo-
cratic-controlled States that have run 
out of money and people to tax. 
This $1.9 trillion proposal, which in-
cidentally is $1,900,000 millions, is a co-
lossal waste of money. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting ‘‘no.’’

REPUBLICANS DO NOT CONDONE 
CAPITOL ATTACK 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to point out to 
my Democrat colleagues that there is 
no Republican Member of Congress 
that condones the attack on the Cap-
itol on January 6. 
I was also a victim in this Chamber 
when it happened, and we are very of-
fended at your constant attacks on us 
for claiming we had anything to do 
with it. So that needs to stop. 
EQUALITY ACT CAUSES DISCRIMINATION 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. I would 
also like to address the entire 117th 
Congress and say that the Equality Act 
is not about stopping discrimination. It 
is about causing discrimination against 
women and religious freedoms.

Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I move that the House do now

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, as you 
know, as a result of COVID–19 and our 
discussions with the Capitol physician, 
we have organized voting in a way that 
we have seven different segments at 5- 
minute intervals so that a limited 
number of Members will vote in every 
5-minute segment. That is obviously 
designed to keep us as safe as possible, 
our staffs as safe as possible, so we get 
off the floor, and they have to be on 
the floor. 
This vote that we just had was about 
1 hour and 5 minutes. Obviously, if you 
take seven segments at 5 minutes a 
segment, that is 35 minutes. We have 
added another 5 minutes for people who 
missed their segment, which would be 
40 minutes. We are starting to average 
20, 25, 30, 35 minutes beyond that 40 
minutes. 
Therefore, I wanted to announce to 
every Member that I will be recom-
mending that we close votes 45 minutes 
after they start. Bang. 
Now, I will tell my side—which prob-
ably has this responsibility more than 
the other side because we use proxies 
more than you do—that if you hold a 
proxy, not only do you have a responsi-
bility to yourself to vote in a timely 
fashion, but if you miss the vote, act-
ing in a fiduciary capacity for another 
Member who can’t be here because of 
health-related issues, and you do not 
vote, that will not be a happy situa-
tion. 
So I want you to know, I am going to 
be talking to the Speaker—I have al-
ready talked to her—that 45 minutes 
after that first bell rings I want the 
gavel to come down. And, hopefully, we 
will all recognize when the bell rings 
that we will have to vote in the next 45 
minutes. Now, that cannot be a real 
burden on anybody. Cannot. 
It is simply that we look to see how 
many people have voted—oh, well, 
there are 20 people out, so I don’t have 
to worry, and that is after we have 
gone by the 40 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to send 
out a notice on this as well, and I want 
to confirm with the Speaker, but I 
know, having talked to the Speaker 
numerous times about this issue, that 
she shares my view that if we are going 
to run this institution with respect to 
one another— DON YOUNG didn’t come 
on this vote. DON YOUNG is the fa-
mous—call it on time. 
I want every Member to understand, 
this is not to penalize anybody. It is, 
however, to try to run this institution 
in a way that Members’ time, which is 
valuable, is respected, and we simply 
don’t waste it waiting around for one 
or two or five or six other people to 
come. I do not cast aspersions. Some-
times it is hard to get here on time, 
particularly if you have done some-
thing and you are in some other place. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
time. I will be talking to the Speaker. 
I will notify everybody when that is 
going to be implemented. It may be im-
plemented as soon as today, and we 
will be sending out a notice. And, by 
the way, everybody I talked to agrees 
with this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H634 
February 25, 2021 
the bill (H.R. 5) to prohibit discrimina-
tion on the basis of sex, gender iden-
tity, and sexual orientation, and for 
other purposes, and ask for its imme-
diate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 147, the bill is 
considered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equality 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Discrimination can occur on the basis 
of the sex, sexual orientation, gender iden-
tity, pregnancy, childbirth, or a related med-
ical condition of an individual, as well as be-
cause of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these 
factors alone can serve as the basis for dis-
crimination, and each is a form of sex dis-
crimination. 
(2) A single instance of discrimination may 
have more than one basis. For example, dis-
crimination against a married same-sex cou-
ple could be based on the sex stereotype that 
marriage should only be between hetero-
sexual couples, the sexual orientation of the 
two individuals in the couple, or both. In ad-
dition, some persons are subjected to dis-
crimination based on a combination or the 
intersection of multiple protected character-
istics. Discrimination against a pregnant les-
bian could be based on her sex, her sexual 
orientation, her pregnancy, or on the basis of 
multiple factors. 
(3) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
queer (referred to as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) people com-
monly experience discrimination in securing 
access to public accommodations—including 
restaurants, senior centers, stores, places of 
or establishments that provide entertain-
ment, health care facilities, shelters, govern-
ment offices, youth service providers includ-
ing adoption and foster care providers, and 
transportation. Forms of discrimination in-
clude the exclusion and denial of entry, un-
equal or unfair treatment, harassment, and 
violence. This discrimination prevents the 
full participation of LGBTQ people in soci-
ety and disrupts the free flow of commerce. 
(4) Women also have faced discrimination 
in many establishments such as stores and 
restaurants, and places or establishments 
that provide other goods or services, such as 
entertainment or transportation, including 
sexual harassment, differential pricing for 
substantially similar products and services, 
and denial of services because they are preg-
nant or breastfeeding. 
(5) Many employers already and continue 
to take proactive steps, beyond those re-
quired by some States and localities, to en-
sure they are fostering positive and respect-
ful cultures for all employees. Many places 
of public accommodation also recognize the 
economic imperative to offer goods and serv-
ices to as many consumers as possible. 
(6) Regular and ongoing discrimination 
against LGBTQ people, as well as women, in 
accessing public accommodations contrib-
utes to negative social and economic out-
comes, and in the case of public accommoda-
tions operated by State and local govern-
ments, abridges individuals’ constitutional 
rights. 
(7) The discredited practice known as ‘‘con-
version therapy’’ is a form of discrimination 
that harms LGBTQ people by undermining 
individuals’ sense of self worth, increasing 
suicide ideation and substance abuse, exacer-
bating family conflict, and contributing to 
second-class status. 
(8) Both LGBTQ people and women face 
widespread discrimination in employment 
and various services, including by entities 
that receive Federal financial assistance. 
Such discrimination— 
(A) is particularly troubling and inappro-
priate for programs and services funded 
wholly or in part by the Federal Govern-
ment; 
(B) undermines national progress toward 
equal treatment regardless of sex, sexual ori-
entation, or gender identity; and 
(C) is inconsistent with the constitutional 
principle of equal protection under the Four-
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States. 
(9) Federal courts have widely recognized 
that, in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
Congress validly invoked its powers under 
the Fourteenth Amendment to provide a full 
range of remedies in response to persistent, 
widespread, and pervasive discrimination by 
both private and government actors. 
(10) Discrimination by State and local gov-
ernments on the basis of sexual orientation 
or gender identity in employment, housing, 
and public accommodations, and in programs 
and activities receiving Federal financial as-
sistance, 
violates 
the 
Equal 
Protection 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States. In many 
circumstances, such discrimination also vio-
lates other constitutional rights such as 
those of liberty and privacy under the due 
process clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment. 
(11) Individuals who are LGBTQ, or are per-
ceived to be LGBTQ, have been subjected to 
a history and pattern of persistent, wide-
spread, and pervasive discrimination on the 
bases of sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity by both private sector and Federal, 
State, and local government actors, includ-
ing in employment, housing, and public ac-
commodations, and in programs and activi-
ties receiving Federal financial assistance. 
This discrimination inflicts a range of tan-
gible and intangible harms, sometimes even 
including serious physical injury or death. 
An explicit and comprehensive national solu-
tion is needed to address this discrimination, 
including the full range of remedies avail-
able under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
(12) Discrimination based on sexual ori-
entation includes discrimination based on an 
individual’s actual or perceived romantic, 
emotional, physical, or sexual attraction to 
other persons, or lack thereof, on the basis of 
gender. LGBTQ people, including gender non-
binary people, also commonly experience dis-
crimination because of sex-based stereo-
types. Many people are subjected to dis-
crimination because of others’ perceptions or 
beliefs regarding their sexual orientation. 
Even if these perceptions are incorrect, the 
identity imputed by others forms the basis of 
discrimination. 
(13) Numerous provisions of Federal law ex-
pressly prohibit discrimination on the basis 
of sex, and Federal courts and agencies have 
correctly interpreted these prohibitions on 
sex discrimination to include discrimination 
based on sexual orientation, gender identity, 
and sex stereotypes. In particular, the Su-
preme Court of the United States correctly 
held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 
1731 (2020) that the prohibition on employ-
ment discrimination because of sex under 
title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 inher-
ently includes discrimination because of sex-
ual orientation or transgender status. 
(14) This Act makes explicit that existing 
Federal statutes prohibiting sex discrimina-
tion in employment (including in access to 
benefits), healthcare, housing, education, 
credit, and jury service also prohibit sexual 
orientation and gender identity discrimina-
tion. 
(15) LGBTQ people often face discrimina-
tion when seeking to rent or purchase hous-
ing, as well as in every other aspect of ob-
taining and maintaining housing. LGBTQ 
people in same-sex relationships are often 
discriminated against when two names asso-
ciated with one gender appear on a housing 
application, and transgender people often en-
counter discrimination when credit checks 
or inquiries reveal a former name. 
(16) National surveys, including a study 
commissioned by the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, show that housing 
discrimination against LGBTQ people is very 
prevalent. For instance, when same-sex cou-
ples inquire about housing that is available 
for rent, they are less likely to receive posi-
tive responses from landlords. A national 
matched-pair testing investigation found 
that nearly one-half of same-sex couples had 
encountered adverse, differential treatment 
when seeking elder housing. According to 
other studies, transgender people have half 
the homeownership rate of non-transgender 
people and about 1 in 5 transgender people 
experience homelessness. Another survey 
found that 82 percent of gender nonbinary 
people experiencing homelessness lacked ac-
cess to shelter. 
(17) As a result of the absence of explicit 
prohibitions against discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity, credit applicants who are LGBTQ, or 
are perceived to be LGBTQ, have unequal op-
portunities to establish credit. LGBTQ peo-
ple can experience being denied a mortgage, 
credit card, student loan, or many other 
types of credit simply because of their sexual 
orientation or gender identity. 
(18) Numerous studies demonstrate that 
LGBTQ people, especially transgender people 
and women, are economically disadvantaged 
and at a higher risk for poverty compared 
with other groups of people. For example, 
the poverty rate for older women in same-sex 
couples is twice that of older different-sex 
couples. 
(19) The right to an impartial jury of one’s 
peers and the reciprocal right to jury service 
are fundamental to the free and democratic 
system of justice in the United States and 
are based in the Bill of Rights. There is, how-
ever, an unfortunate and long-documented 
history in the United States of attorneys dis-
criminating against LGBTQ individuals, or 
those perceived to be LGBTQ, in jury selec-
tion. Failure to bar peremptory challenges 
based on the actual or perceived sexual ori-
entation or gender identity of an individual 
not only erodes a fundamental right, duty, 
and obligation of being a citizen of the 
United States, but also unfairly creates a 
second class of citizenship for LGBTQ vic-
tims, witnesses, plaintiffs, and defendants. 
(20) Numerous studies document the short-
age of qualified and available homes for the 
approximately 424,000 youth in the child wel-
fare system and the negative outcomes for 
the many youth who live in group care as op-
posed to a loving home or who age out of 
care without a permanent family placement. 
Although same-sex couples are 7 times more 
likely to foster or adopt than their different- 
sex counterparts, many child-placing agen-
cies refuse to serve same-sex couples and 
LGBTQ individuals. This has resulted in a 
reduction of the pool of qualified and avail-
able homes for youth in the child welfare 
system who need placement on a temporary 
or permanent basis. It also sends a negative 
message about LGBTQ people to children 
and youth in the child welfare system about 
who is, and who is not, considered fit to be a

parent. While the priority should be on pro-
viding the supports necessary to keep chil-
dren with their families, when removal is re-
quired, barring discrimination in foster care 
and adoption will increase the number of 
homes available to foster children waiting 
for foster and adoptive families. 
(21) LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in 
the foster care system by at least a factor of 
two and report twice the rate of poor treat-
ment while in care compared to their non- 
LGBTQ counterparts. LGBTQ youth in foster 
care have a higher average number of place-
ments, higher likelihood of living in a group 
home, and higher rates of hospitalization for 
emotional reasons and of juvenile justice in-
volvement than their non-LGBTQ peers be-
cause of the high level of bias and discrimi-
nation that they face and the difficulty of 
finding affirming foster placements. Further, 
due to their physical distance from friends 
and family, traumatic experiences, and po-
tentially 
unstable 
living 
situations, 
all 
youth involved with child welfare services 
are at risk for being targeted by traffickers 
seeking to exploit children. Barring dis-
crimination in child welfare services will en-
sure improved treatment and outcomes for 
LGBTQ foster children. 
(22) Courts consistently have found that 
the government has a compelling interest in 
preventing and remedying discrimination. 
For example, the Supreme Court of the 
United States found there to be a compelling 
government interest in eliminating sex dis-
crimination in Board of Directors of Rotary 
International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 
U.S. 537, 549 (1987). Because discrimination 
based on sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity inherently is a form of sex discrimina-
tion, as held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 
140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), this Act furthers the 
compelling government interest in providing 
redress for the serious harms to mental and 
physical 
health, 
financial 
security 
and 
wellbeing, civic participation, freedom of 
movement and opportunity, personal dig-
nity, and physical safety that result from 
discrimination. Consistent with the role non-
discrimination laws play in protecting lives 
and livelihoods, alleviating suffering, and 
improving individual and public health, the 
Supreme Court of the United States has long 
recognized, under the decision in Heart of 
Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 
241 (1964), that these laws also benefit society 
as a whole by ending the ‘‘disruptive effect’’ 
discrimination has on travel and commerce, 
and by creating a level field for all partici-
pants in a given sector. 
(23) As with all prohibitions on invidious 
discrimination, this Act furthers the govern-
ment’s compelling interest in the least re-
strictive way because only by forbidding dis-
crimination is it possible to avert or redress 
the harms described in this subsection. 
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act 
to expand as well as clarify, confirm and cre-
ate greater consistency in the protections 
and remedies against discrimination on the 
basis of all covered characteristics and to 
provide guidance and notice to individuals, 
organizations, corporations, and agencies re-
garding their obligations under the law.

AMEND-
MENT.—The table of sections for chapter 121

‘‘1879. Rules of construction and claims.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 90 minutes, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Commitment on the Judiciary. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 45 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 5. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 5, the Equality 
Act, which amends the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 and other core civil rights stat-
utes to explicitly prohibit discrimina-
tion on the basis of sexual orientation 
and gender identity. The bill would 
also strengthen nondiscrimination pro-
tections for women and others. 
In short, this long overdue legisla-
tion will provide millions of LGBTQ 
Americans explicit protections from 
being denied medical care, fired from 
their jobs, or thrown out of their 
homes simply because of who they are. 
Much of the history of the United 
States is about expanding the defini-
tion of who is understood to be in-
cluded when the Declaration of Inde-
pendence says ‘‘all men are created 
equal.’’ When these words were first 
written, that phrase did not include 
Black and Latino men; it did not in-
clude Native Americans; it did not in-
clude women; and it did not include 
LGBTQ individuals. 
Once again, we have an opportunity 
to continue our march toward justice 
and to enshrine in our Nation’s laws 
protections for marginalized commu-
nities to ensure that everyone can fully 
participate in key areas of life and to 
provide them resources in the face of 
discrimination. 
Today, I expect we will hear argu-
ments asking us to pick and choose 
which of our Nation’s children deserve 
our support, to pick which of our chil-
dren are valuable enough to have a 
right to live their lives to the fullest. 
But that is a false choice and one de-
signed to pit rights for some against 
rights for all. There is no question that 
all our children, including those who 
are transgender, deserve the freedom to 
choose their own path. 
Many of the protections codified by 
this bill already exist throughout the 
country, whether through court deci-
sions or in State laws. In those places, 
women still have rights, religious free-
dom is still protected, parents are still 
involved in their children’s healthcare, 
and doctors are still free to exercise 
their professional medical judgment. 
And trans athletes from high schools 
to the Olympic trials sometimes win 
and sometimes lose, just like everyone 
else. 
But the ability to have a job, to re-
ceive medical care, or to rent a home 
should not depend on who someone is, 
where they happen to live, or who rep-
resents them. LGBTQ people should 
not have to worry that a future Su-
preme Court could rip away their exist-
ing protections. They deserve the same 
protections as other communities that 
have historically faced discrimination, 
and that requires action from Con-
gress. 
For decades, the LGBTQ community 
has been telling us their stories of out-
rageous discrimination. Madam Speak-
er, to my colleagues, I say that it is far 
past time we stop asking them to come 
to the Capitol just to defend their ex-
istence. 
To the LGBTQ community and, in 
particular, the trans youth and ath-
letes who I expect will hear themselves 
demonized on the floor today: We see 
you, we appreciate you, we value you, 
and we will continue to fight for you. 
I thank the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), for his tireless 
leadership in introducing this bill and 
helping to shepherd it through the leg-
islative process. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this landmark legis-
lation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong sup-
port of H.R. 5, the ‘‘Equality Act,’’ which 
amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 
other core civil rights statutes, to explicitly pro-
hibit discrimination on the basis of sexual ori-
entation and gender identity. The bill would 
also strengthen non-discrimination protections 
for women and others. 
In short, this long overdue legislation will 
provide millions of LGBTQ Americans explicit 
protections from being denied medical care, 
fired from their jobs, or thrown out of their 
homes simply because of who they are. 
Much of the history of the United States has 
been about expanding the definition of who is 
understood to be included when the Declara-
tion of Independence says, ‘‘all men are cre-
ated equal.’’ When these words were first writ-
ten, that phrase did not include black and 
Latino men; it did not include Native Ameri-
cans; it did not include women; and it did not 
include LGBTQ individuals. 
Once again, we have an opportunity before 
us to continue our march toward justice—to 
enshrine in our nation’s laws protections for 
marginalized communities to ensure that ev-
eryone can fully participate in key areas of life, 
and to provide them recourse in the face of 
discrimination. 
Today, I expect we will hear arguments that 
will ask us to pick and choose which of our 
nation’s children deserve our support—to pick 
which of our children are valuable enough to 
have a right to live their lives to the fullest. 
Despite what we will hear, that is a false 
choice—one designed to pit rights for some 
against rights for all. There is no question that 
all our children—including those that are 
transgender—deserve to have the freedom to 
choose their own path. 
The Equality Act seeks to make our civil 
rights laws inclusive of all people who have 
historically faced discrimination. Not only does 
it provide explicit protections for the LGBTQ 
community, it also expands protections for 
women and people of color. 
Under the Equality Act, women will finally be 
protected from discrimination in public accom-
modations and federally funded programs. By 
expanding the existing definition of public ac-
commodations under the Civil Rights Act, the 
Equality Act also increases protections for 
people on the basis of race, color, religion, 
and national origin. 
People of color should not need to fear 
being targeted and discriminated against while 
shopping, just because of the color of their 
skin. Muslim people should not need to fear 
being targeted while flying, just because of 
their religion. And LGBTQ people and women 
should not need to fear being denied services 
in public spaces and services simply because 
of who they are. At long last, this legislation 
provides them with legal recourse if they face 
such discrimination. 
Many of the protections being codified by 
this bill already exist across all 50 states fol-
lowing the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bostock 
v. Clayton County in 2020, and we know that 
more than 20 states have had some version of 
the protections before us today even before 
the Supreme Court’s ruling. In those places 
women still have rights, religious freedom is 
still protected, parents are still involved in their 
children’s healthcare, and doctors are still free 
to exercise their professional medical judg-
ment. And trans athletes, from high schools to 
the Olympic trials, sometimes win and some-
times lose, just like everyone else. 
Opponents of the Equality Act argue that it 
undermines women’s rights. That assertion is 
false. The Equality Act simply ensures that all 
women, including trans women, are included 
in female institutions and programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H638 
February 25, 2021 
When it comes to athletics, the Equality Act 
ensures 
that 
LGBTQ 
students—including 
women and girls who are lesbian, bisexual, or 
transgender—will have the same opportunity 
to participate in sports as their peers. Trans 
women and girls have been participating in 
sports consistent with their gender at all levels 
for years, and we have not seen any domi-
nance by trans athletes. 
Young people who are trans are competing 
in sports for the same reasons as their peers 
who are not transgender—including to be part 
of a team and to challenge themselves—and 
they deserve the same opportunities as their 
cisgender peers. 
That is why the Women’s Sports Founda-
tion, National Women’s Law Center, and hun-
dreds of athletes in women’s sports and other 
women’s rights groups have consistently 
voiced their strong support for inclusion of 
transgender women and girls in women’s 
sports and have opposed efforts to exclude 
them. Women’s sports can play a critical role 
in women’s development and equality and in-
cluding all women and girls in women’s sports 
strengthens women’s sports. 
Similarly, single-sex institutions like wom-
en’s and men’s colleges have played an im-
portant and historic role in making our nation’s 
higher education system the strongest and 
most diverse in the world. To be clear, nothing 
in the Equality Act should be construed to pro-
hibit or otherwise limit or affect the ability of 
single-sex colleges to maintain their single-sex 
status. Moreover, it is not Congress’s intention 
to alter in any way Title IX or the scope or 
availability of its exemptions as they currently 
stand. 
In addition, the Equality Act will not under-
mine services like single-sex homeless shel-
ters or single sex-facilities. It will simply en-
sure that these facilities do not discriminate on 
the basis of sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity. Arguments that providing transgender 
people access to facilities consistent with their 
gender identity will undermine women’s safety 
have no basis in reality. Laws protecting 
LGBTQ people from discrimination do not au-
thorize anyone to engage in abusive or 
harassing behavior. 
That is why over 300 domestic violence and 
sexual assault organizations, including the Na-
tional Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the Na-
tional Center on Domestic and Sexual Vio-
lence, and the National Center for Victims of 
Crime, have signed onto a National Con-
sensus Statement of Anti-Sexual Assault and 
Domestic Violence Organizations in Support of 
Full and Equal Access for the Transgender 
Community. 
Transgender people experience shockingly 
high rates of sexual and physical violence, 
and the real risk of violence occurs when 
transgender people are barred from using the 
appropriate facilities. 
The idea that transgender people need ex-
plicit protections from discrimination is not 
new. Dozens of states provide nondiscrimina-
tion protections in public accommodations on 
the basis of gender identity, and in those 
states we have not seen the parade of 
horribles that Equality Act opponents raise. 
The request to pit people’s rights against 
each other is not based on the real-world out-
comes—for which ample evidence exists to 
the contrary—but a continued resistance to 
advancing rights for those different from so 
many of us here in Congress. The ability to 
have a job, to receive medical care, or to rent 
a home should not depend on who someone 
is, where they happen to live, or who rep-
resents then politically. LGBTQ people should 
not have to worry that a future Supreme Court 
could rip away their existing protections, and 
they deserve the same protections as other 
communities that have historically faced dis-
crimination. And that requires action from Con-
gress. 
For decades, the LGBTQ community has 
been coming here over and over to tell us 
their stories of outrageous discrimination. To 
my colleagues, I say, it is far past time we 
stop asking them to come to the Capitol just 
to defend their existence. 
To the LGBTQ community—and in particular 
the trans youth and athletes who I expect will 
hear themselves demonized on the floor 
today—we see you, we appreciate you, we 
value you, and we will continue to fight for 
you. 
I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island, 
Representative DAVID CICILLINE, for his tireless 
leadership in introducing this bill and helping 
to shepherd it through the legislative process. 
I urge my colleagues to support this landmark 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
have a unanimous consent request at 
the desk. 
My request is to allow a 30-second 
moment of silence for the passing of 
Rush Limbaugh, one of the greatest 
radio hosts ever, and I make that as a 
formal request. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ob-
ject. 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, may 
I request a point of personal privilege. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
HAALAND). The gentleman has been rec-
ognized for debate. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), who is a 
distinguished sponsor of this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, dis-
crimination is wrong. We all know 
that. As children, we learn the golden 
rule: Treat others the way you yourself 
want to be treated. 
But, right now, discrimination is a 
fact of life for millions of LGBTQ 
Americans. 
The fact is that, in most States, an 
LGBTQ person is at risk of being de-
nied housing, education, or the right to 
serve on a jury because of who they 
are. That is why we are here today to 
consider H.R. 5, the Equality Act. 
The Equality Act does no more and 
no less than say LGBTQ people deserve 
the same rights and responsibilities as 
all other Americans, most fundamen-
tally the right to live lives free of dis-
crimination. It builds on the Civil 
Rights Act and other existing laws to 
extend anti-discrimination protections 
to 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
and 
transgender Americans. 
President Biden has said that getting 
this bill signed into law is one of his 
top priorities for his first 100 days in 
office. 
I want to thank him and a few other 
people for making this bill a priority: 
Speaker 
PELOSI, 
Majority 
Leader 
HOYER, Whip CLYBURN, and the co- 
chairs of the LGBTQ Equality Caucus: 
MARK TAKANO, MARK POCAN, SEAN PAT-
RICK MALONEY, ANGIE CRAIG, SHARICE 
DAVIDS, 
CHRIS
PAPPAS, 
MONDAIRE 
JONES, and RITCHIE TORRES. 
I thank them all for being true cham-
pions for our community. 
Madam Speaker, every American de-
serves to be treated with respect and 
dignity. That is what the Equality Act 
will achieve for the LGBTQ community 
by providing protection against dis-
crimination in employment, education, 
housing, credit, jury service, public ac-
commodations, and Federal funding. 
I am proud to say this bill has broad 
support from across the political spec-
trum, including groups from the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce to the ACLU 
and everyone in between. 
Madam Speaker, 83 percent of Ameri-
cans support this bill, including 68 per-
cent—more than two out of three—Re-
publican voters. 
To my friends on the other side of 
the aisle: As you consider this bill, I 
hope you will bear in mind how your 
vote will be remembered years from 
now. 
Will you be remembered in the same 
breath as all those who fought for 
equal rights in the past: Freedom Rid-
ers, suffragettes, the anti-apartheid ac-
tivists? Or will you be remembered 
along with those who stood in the way 
of progress? 
This bill is personal for me and per-
sonal for millions of LGBTQ people and 
our loved ones. Madam Speaker, you 
all have family members, friends, and 
coworkers who identify as LGBTQ. 
I want you to ask yourself: What does 
this vote mean for them and how you 
will look them in the eye if you vote to 
uphold the current system that allows 
them to be discriminated against? 
The LGBTQ community has waited 
long enough. The time has come to ex-
tend the blessings of liberty and equal-
ity to all Americans, regardless of who 
they are or whom they love. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ and pass the Equality Act 
today. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. SPARTZ). 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 5, the so- 
called Equality Act. 
Unfortunately, this is another bill 
which did not go through the com-
mittee process or real debate. 
The 
Judiciary 
Committee 
should 
have had an opportunity to consider 
H.R. 5 in a legislative hearing. Sadly, 
this is the first time we are debating, 
just hours before it is set to receive a 
vote, with no ability to propose any 
amendments. I am not sure why we 
even bother to have committees if we

February 25, 2021 
are 
passing 
significant 
legislation 
without them. 
I would just like to highlight three 
major concerns. 
Concern number one: Broad scope. 
And I agree with the gentleman from 
New York, there are some protections 
that already exist. Last year, the issue 
of possible employment discrimination 
of gay and transgender individuals was 
addressed by the Supreme Court in an 
opinion written by Justice Gorsuch. 
But this bill has very sweeping changes 
with potential major adverse implica-
tions for religious freedoms and wom-
en’s rights and safety. 
Concern number two: Broad and am-
biguous definition of gender identity. 
This language can have unintended 
consequences and be taken advantage 
of by criminals or sexual predators. 
Also, the safety of women in prisons, 
juvenile detention facilities, and do-
mestic violence shelters could be put 
at risk, which would force them to 
share traditionally women-only spaces 
with biological men, even if a biologi-
cal male fraudulently gains access. 
Concern number three: Opportunities 
and safety for female athletes. The 
science is clear, men are biologically 
stronger than women. 
According to a 2019 Duke University 
study that involved dozens of special-
ists in sports science and medicine: 
‘‘Biological males and biological fe-
males are materially different with re-
spect to main physical attributes that 
contribute to elite athletic perform-
ance.’’ 
The Women’s Sports Policy Working 
Group—a group of champion female 
athletes and academics—has stated 
that even when height, size, and weight 
are equal, males are incrementally 
stronger and generate more explosive 
force so that if males and females are 
forced to compete against each other, 
the physical safety of females is dif-
ferently at risk. 
The reality has already shown itself 
to be harmful to the opportunities and 
safety of female athletes. For example, 
a female track athlete in Connecticut 
lost potential scholarships after being 
pushed out of qualifying for regional 
track meet spots by two transgender 
athletes. A transgender MMA fighter 
caused significant damage to a female 
athlete’s skull. 
These examples demonstrate the far- 
reaching consequences this bill can 
have on women and girls, should it be-
come law. 
American women have worked very 
hard to secure our rights for many 
years, and just last year we celebrated 
100 years of women’s suffrage. But this 
is a giant step back. Perhaps if this 
body had actually deliberated over this 
bill and engaged the proper legislative 
process, these concerns could have been 
addressed. 
A vote for the Equality Act in its 
current form is a vote against religious 
freedom, against women, against fe-
male athletes, against incarcerated 
women, and against science and safety. 
A vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill is a vote 
against our daughters. 
b 1345 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
does anybody know what it means to 
be called names; to be thrown out of 
your apartment; to be thrown off of a 
job; and most sadly, to not be allowed 
to love the person that you love? 
In the Hodges case, that was settled 
when they determined that no union is 
more profound than marriage, for it 
embodies the highest ideals of love, fi-
delity, devotion, sacrifice and family. 
And then they ruled. They asked for 
equal dignity in the eyes of law; the 
Constitution grants them that right. 
I rise in support of the Equality Act 
because I know what it means to be 
thrown out, to be looked at, and to be 
undermined. Our friends in the LGBTQ 
community every single day experience 
that. Trans women who are African 
American have been murdered. 
This gives us equal dignity under the 
law. We could keep a job. If you are in 
that community, you can be married 
already, obviously, but you can keep a 
job. You can get healthcare; you can 
ensure that you can keep an apart-
ment. You can walk in dignity. 
We need the Equality Act as we have 
needed civil rights laws throughout 
this Nation. 
If we are the place of ‘‘We the Peo-
ple,’’ if this Nation is based upon, we 
the people, then we will pass the Equal-
ity Act today. We will pass it now. 
I thank the gentleman from Rhode 
Island for his leadership and the gen-
tleman from New York. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary and an original co-
sponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the 
‘‘Equality Act of 2021.’’ 
Let me thank my colleague on the Judiciary 
Committee, Congressman DAVID CICILLINE of 
Rhode Island, for introducing this landmark 
legislation and his tireless efforts in making 
this day a reality. 
Madam Speaker, our nation’s long but inex-
orable march towards equality reaches an-
other milestone today. 
For as long as our national charters have 
been in existence, we have endeavored to ask 
ourselves: what do we mean when we say 
‘‘We the People?’’ 
How expansive do we hold our pledge that 
all are entitled to the blessings of life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. 
To be certain our nation has come a long 
way, but as we debate this critical bill, I am re-
minded of the Supreme Court’s decision in 
Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 
2584 (2015), and its powerful conclusion ex-
plaining the profound power of love and mar-
riage, and the desire to be seen as equal in 
the eyes of the law: 
No union is more profound than marriage, 
for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fi-
delity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In 
forming a marital union, two people become 
something greater than once they were. As 
some of the petitioners in these cases dem-
onstrate, marriage embodies a love that may 
endure even past death. It would misunder-
stand these men and women to say they dis-
respect the idea of marriage. Their plea is 
that they do respect it, respect it so deeply 
that they seek to find its fulfillment for 
themselves. Their hope is not to be con-
demned to live in loneliness, excluded from 
one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They 
ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. 
The Constitution grants them that right. 
Despite significant legal advances over the 
past several years, including marriage equal-
ity, LGBTQ Americans remain vulnerable to 
discrimination daily and too often have little re-
course. 
In the 116th Congress, the Equality Act had 
the bipartisan support of Members of Con-
gress, with nearly 240 co-sponsors, as well as 
the strong support of the business community, 
and most important, the overwhelming support 
of the American people. 
In the 117th Congress, the Equality Act was 
reintroduced with 223 original cosponsors. 
More than 70 percent of American support 
the Equality Act. 
This has been a long journey; the first 
Equality Act was introduced nearly 46 years 
ago. 
It is long past time to secure the civil rights 
of LGBTQ people across the country and ac-
cord them full membership in the American 
family. 
With the Trump Administration rolling back 
protections at the federal level and anti-equal-
ity opponents continuing to push discrimina-
tory bills at the state level, LGBTQ people 
cannot wait another year for affirmation that 
they are worthy of the dignity of their peers 
and deserving of equal protection of the laws. 
Today, too many LGBTQ Americans in too 
many places remain too vulnerable to discrimi-
nation daily with too little legal recourse. 
Fifty percent of the national LGBTQ commu-
nity live in states where, though they may 
have the right to marry, they have no explicit 
non-discrimination protections in other areas 
of daily life. 
The Equality Act extends the full anti-dis-
crimination protections of the landmark Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and other key pillars of fair-
ness and justice in our country to LGBTQ 
Americans. 
Sexual orientation and gender identity de-
serve full civil rights protections, not just in the 
workplace, but in every place: in education, 
housing, credit, jury service, public facilities, 
and public accommodations. 
Today, there are only 21 states have explicit 
laws barring discrimination based on sexual 
orientation in employment, housing, and public 
accommodations, and only 20 states have 
such protections for gender identity. 
In most states, a same-sex couple can get 
married on Saturday, then be legally denied 
service at a restaurant on Sunday, and be 
fired from their jobs on Monday, and evicted 
from their apartment on Tuesday. 
Madam Speaker, let me take a moment to 
discuss in more detail several of the important 
elements of the Equality Act. 
The Equality Act amends existing federal 
civil rights laws to explicitly prohibit discrimina-
tion based on sexual orientation and gender 
identity in education, employment, housing, 
credit, Federal jury service, public accom-
modations, and the use of Federal funds. 
It does so by adding sex in some places 
where it had not previously been protected,

February 25, 2021 
and clarifying that sex includes sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity. 
Specifically, H.R. 5, the ‘‘Equality Act of 
2021’’ amends: 
Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to pro-
vide basic protections against discrimination in 
public accommodations by adding sex, includ-
ing sexual orientation and gender identity; 
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to 
provide basic protections against discrimina-
tion by recipients of federal financial assist-
ance by adding sex, including sexual orienta-
tion, and gender identity; 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the 
Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the Govern-
ment Employee Rights Act of 1991, and the 
Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to 
make explicit protections against workplace 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity; 
The Fair Housing Act of 1968 to make pro-
tections against 1 housing discrimination 
based on sexual orientation or gender identity 
explicit; 
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act to make 
protections against 7 credit discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity explicit; and 
The Jury Selections and Services Act to 
make protections against discrimination in fed-
eral jury service based on sexual orientation 
or gender identity explicit. 
The march towards equality has been long 
and has awoken passions passion from many 
quarters for various reasons. 
Well-intentioned people from all walks of life 
have had difficulty as progress washes over 
the debate surrounding protections for same 
sex individuals. 
At times, the debate has seen input from 
members of the faith community, who strive to 
reconcile their love for all of God’s sons and 
daughters, with the script of their sacred text. 
I understand this tension, but I have care-
fully studied the text and am confident that 
passage of the Equality Act will not adversely 
affect any person’s freedom of worship of the 
free exercise of their faith. 
The Equality Act adds sexual orientation 
and gender identity to federal civil rights law 
and sex where it is missing. 
But the same statutory exemptions that are 
already in place in the Civil Rights Act and the 
Fair Housing Act will remain in place after en-
actment and the guarantees of the United 
States Constitution remain untouched. 
The U.S. Constitution provides ample pro-
tections for religious freedom and nothing in 
this bill would, or could, infringe upon the pro-
tections afforded by the Constitution, as the 
principal sponsor of the bill, Congressman 
Cicilline, confirmed during a colloquy we held 
when the bill was marked up in the Judiciary 
Committee in the 116th Congress. 
Specifically, the provisions relating to Title 
VI of the Civil Rights Act (federal funding) in-
clude the original exemptions for discrimina-
tion based on religion. 
Religious organizations (not just houses of 
worship) are free to limit participation in wide 
array of activities and services to only mem-
bers of their faith. 
This same exemption applies to public ac-
commodations. 
Houses of worship could be considered a 
place of public accommodation only if they 
offer their space or services for commercial 
public use. 
This does not include religious services. 
Nothing in this bill alters the ability of 
houses of worship or religious leaders to prac-
tice or carry out their faith. 
No member of the clergy will ever be com-
pelled to perform a religious ceremony that 
conflicts with their beliefs, including marrying 
same-sex couples. 
The DOJ Title VI Manual and relevant and 
relevant case law clearly provide that a reli-
gious organization that is not ‘‘principally en-
gaged’’ in providing social services is only 
bound by nondiscrimination requirements re-
lated to the program for which they receive 
funding if that funding is targeted in order to 
provide a specific program or service, i.e. dis-
aster relief, rather than to the entity ‘‘as a 
whole.’’ 
Nothing in the Equality Act changes that 
rule. 
There is a longstanding ministerial exemp-
tion in federal civil rights law that exempts reli-
gious organizations from complying with em-
ployment nondiscrimination provisions for min-
isters, rabbis and any other person who is 
‘‘carrying out the faith’’. 
The Equality Act does not alter that exemp-
tion in any way. 
The Equality Act does not repeal the Reli-
gious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). 
The Equality Act clarifies that RFRA cannot 
be used to defend discrimination in public set-
tings or with federal funds. 
The Equality Act does not alter or amend 
the RFRA standard for any other kinds of 
claims. 
Federal civil rights laws and the United 
States Constitution provide many exemptions 
for religious organizations. 
It bears stating again that the statutory ex-
emptions that are , already in place in the Civil 
Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act will re-
main in place and the United States Constitu-
tion remains untouched. 
Courts have long-rejected religious claims 
as a reason to deny civil rights protections, in-
cluding those based on race and sex, and the 
same analysis applies to all other protected 
characteristics. 
Specifically, religious belief did not exempt 
restaurants or hotels from complying with the 
civil rights laws passed in the 1960s and can-
not do so today. 
RFRA explicitly contemplates that Congress 
would exempt certain laws from its application. 
The clarifying language in the Equality Act is 
necessary to ensure that courts do not mis-
interpret the intended interaction between 
RFRA and our civil rights laws. 
RFRA will still be available to address bur-
dens on religious beliefs and practices in other 
contexts. 
And any individual or organization that is 
concerned that their religious beliefs or prac-
tices are being unjustly burdened retains the 
ability to bring a claim under the First Amend-
ment. 
The time has come to extend the full bless-
ings of equality and the majesty of the law’s 
protection to all our brothers and sisters, in-
cluding those in the LGBTQ community. 
Madam Speaker, it been said that ‘‘the 
moral arc of the universe is long but bends to-
ward justice.’’ 
Today, with passage by this House of H.R. 
5, the Equality Act of 2021, we bend that arc 
even more in the direction of justice. 
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of 
this life-changing and life-affirming legislation 
and urge all members to stand on the right of 
history and vote for its passage. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON), the ranking 
member on the Subcommittee of the 
Constitution and Civil Justice. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
H.R. 5, which many have already la-
beled the inequality act because of the 
deep flaws contained in this bill. 
H.R. 
5 
will 
undermine 
women’s 
rights. It will strip parental rights. It 
will gut religious freedom, and it will 
open a Pandora’s box of a universal 
right to abortion. And that is just to 
name a few of the legislation’s out-
rageous provisions. 
In addition to the well-founded, sub-
stantive concerns that you will hear a 
lot about in the next 45 minutes, the 
majority has decided to throw process 
out the window. They brought this bill 
directly to the floor. 
We sit on the Judiciary Committee. 
We should have had a robust discussion 
on the impacts of the legislation. We 
didn’t. There has been no committee 
action. There has been no hearing, no 
deliberation at all by the committee of 
appropriate jurisdiction. And I think, 
many of us think, that the reason for 
that is because the proponents didn’t 
want the bill to be exposed. 
Listen, let’s make one thing clear. 
There are people on both sides of the 
aisle—all of us, everybody in this 
Chamber believes that all people are 
entitled to dignity and respect. 
We believe that every single person is 
made in the image of God and, because 
of that, every single person has ines-
timable dignity and value. We believe, 
as our founding document said, that 
God is the one that endows us with the 
inalienable rights that we have. They 
ought to be protected and respected. 
But unfortunately, the Democrats’ 
misguided effort here tramples all over 
many of those fundamental rights that 
God gives us, the right to life, the right 
to religious freedom. 
While it is true that H.R. 5 does not 
include the word ‘‘abortion’’—our col-
leagues keep reminding us of that—it 
does reference pregnancy and ‘‘related 
medical conditions’’ as areas of protec-
tion against discrimination. Everybody 
knows that this historically has led to 
the inclusion of abortion. We are open-
ing a door here for the rampant tax-
payer funding of abortions on demand; 
in addition to the myriad number of 
conscience protections that exist for 
businesses and medical professionals. 
You will hear a lot about that today as 
well. 
It is telling that the text of the bill 
also directly undermines the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act. Let’s re-
member, RFRA was widely supported 
on both sides of the aisle and signed 
into law by President Clinton in 1993. 
RFRA’s lead Democrat sponsor was our 
colleague, Representative NADLER. It 
passed the House by unanimous con-
sent and the Senate by a vote of 97–3.

But now, the Equality Act, or the in-
equality 
act, 
explicitly 
undercuts 
RFRA by negating its application to 
the underlying legislation. In other 
words, those protections won’t apply 
anymore. 
This is unprecedented. It is dan-
gerous. It is an attack on our first free-
dom, the first freedom listed in the Bill 
of Rights, religious liberty. This is 
something that our faith communities 
are deeply concerned about and all of 
us are as individuals. 
Look, I have to save time for my col-
leagues, and I will just conclude by 
saying this bill is a severe blow to 
women’s rights, to people of faith, to 
every parent, every student, every 
medical professional and so many 
more. Because we believe in the dig-
nity and value of every person, we have 
to oppose this dangerous, un-American 
legislation. I pray that we will. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I stand 
in support of this legislation. I have 
stood in support of this right for over 
25 years. 
When I was a Tennessee State Sen-
ator, I was the only member of the 
State Senate to vote against a con-
stitutional ban on gay marriage. It was 
a legal pejorative; all people should 
have a civil right to be treated equally 
and to be given due process of the law. 
And they should have that today, and 
that is what this bill stands for. 
This is a continuing battle that my 
friend, Julian Bond said was a fight for 
fairness, justice, and equality against 
injustice and bigotry. 
We need to pass this bill and con-
tinue our move to a more perfect 
union. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER). 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 5, the 
so-called Equality Act. 
This bill should be called the inequal-
ity act as there is nothing equalizing 
about it. In fact, this bill hijacks the 
Civil Rights Act, codifying inequality 
into Federal law. Simply put, this 
piece of legislation blatantly discrimi-
nates against women, girls, parents, 
people of faith, and many more. 
To start, H.R. 5 dismantles Title IX, 
ending equal opportunity for females in 
education and sports. Similar policies 
are already wreaking havoc at the 
local level. In Connecticut, the State’s 
Interscholastic Athletic Conference ac-
cepts boys who identify as females in 
their competitions. Two of these male 
athletes have gone on to claim 15 wom-
en’s track championship titles since 
2017. 
As someone who enjoyed playing 
sports and coaching high school track 
for many years, imagining the damage 
these policies will cause to women and 
girls is heartbreaking. 
The inequality act further discrimi-
nates against a woman’s right to pri-
vacy and protection, especially while 
seeking refuge in a domestic violence 
shelter. We have already seen similar 
policies in Alaska and California put 
vulnerable women in danger. 
H.R. 5 also discriminates against par-
ents. Parents who dare to oppose doc-
tors performing life-changing surgeries 
or using hormone-altering drugs on 
their children will be considered abu-
sive and neglectful. This has already 
happened in Ohio as a couple lost cus-
tody of their daughter after advocating 
against male testosterone supplements. 
This abhorrent destruction of paren-
tal rights is why I introduced an 
amendment that would ensure parents 
retain their right to make important 
choices for their children, especially 
concerning mental and medical care. 
Predictably, Democrats did not even 
consider my amendment, highlighting 
their desire to silence the voices of 
families across the country. 
Faith-minded individuals and organi-
zations would also face discrimination 
under the inequality act, including 
adoption agencies and charities. Again, 
similar policies already exist in New 
York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, forc-
ing faith-based adoption agencies to 
shut down rather than violate their 
sincerely held religious beliefs. These 
policies only harm would-be parents 
and children in need of a forever home. 
Shockingly, it doesn’t stop there. 
The inequality act clearly stipulates 
that religious beliefs and faith no 
longer matter in the Democrats’ new 
world order. Living by your faith will 
be viewed as evil instead of good. 
Sadly, this bill contains no language 
to protect businesses or healthcare pro-
viders from being forced to pay for 
abortions. 
It 
also 
may 
require 
healthcare providers to facilitate abor-
tion services. 
The biggest impact? Hundreds of 
thousands more innocent, unborn chil-
dren will tragically perish from abor-
tion, with Americans footing the bill. 
This grossly misnamed bill punishes 
everyday citizens, silences free speech, 
and instills discrimination. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, this 
bill does not affect Title IX and, con-
sequently, religious freedom at all. 
I yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, as a woman, as a feminist, as some-
one who lettered in basketball and 
truly believes in women’s sports, this 
is the Equality Act. Any misrepresen-
tation by some speakers today is just 
totally unfounded. 
While we have made much progress 
in recent years, the reality is that 
many still face discrimination simply 
because of who they are and who they 
love. That means that LGBTQ Ameri-
cans can be fired, refused housing, or 
denied services simply because of who 
they are. 
I am a proud original cosponsor, and 
I am also a woman of faith. I know 
that this Equality Act would help 
greatly to extend civil rights and civil 
liberties for the LGBTQ community, to 
live out the true meaning of our Na-
tion’s creed, free from the fear of har-
assment or discrimination. 
Updating Federal law will provide 
protections across key areas of life, in-
cluding employment, housing, and ac-
cess to public spaces and services. This 
bill has nothing to do with abortion, 
nothing to do with some of the things 
my colleagues across the aisle have 
said. 
And in my home State of Texas, we 
will finally have protections for the 
LGBTQ Texans. 
MR. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The Democrats just said that this 
bill doesn’t harm Title IX. They have 
said it will not hinder women’s ability 
to participate in sports. That is just 
not true. 
They say it is not going to make it 
harder for women to participate in 
sports. It may not make it harder, but 
it is sure going to make it more dif-
ficult to win. We know that. That is 
the problem. And if that doesn’t under-
mine the spirit of Title IX, I don’t 
know what does. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, the gen-
tleman from Ohio is absolutely correct. 
The assertion that it doesn’t impact 
Title IX is completely false. It directly 
amends Title IV in the Civil Rights 
Act. It will have a direct impact on 
educational institutions and would, 
therefore, absolutely impact women’s 
athletics. We all know that. Everybody 
gets the joke. 
But as one of my colleagues said, it is 
100 percent clear that the majority 
doesn’t want to have the American 
people see what is in this bill. They 
don’t want to have it go through com-
mittee. They don’t want to spend time 
on it. They want to jam it through 
under the name of equality. 
See, you put fancy names on bills in 
this building and suddenly people think 
it is about something that it isn’t. And 
we know exactly what this bill is 
about. It is about power. This bill is 
about power and control. 
This is about this institution being 
run by Democrats who want to tell the 
American people how to live their 
lives. 
They want to tell people who dis-
agree on these issues that they need to 
go to the corner and they need to hide; 
that they need to give up their closely 
held beliefs and their values and they 
need to bow down to the altar of the 
people here and the cultural elites in 
Washington, D.C., and do what they 
tell us to do. 
It is an absolute abomination and 
flies in the face of the very principles 
upon which this Nation was founded. 
We know that. We see that. We can go 
through the list. We are all going 
through it.

Rights Act. The Equality Act can be 
used to force a universal right to abor-
tion until birth. It forces medical pro-
fessionals to conduct or assist in per-
forming abortions; forces medical pro-
fessionals to perform certain surgeries 
and administer hormone blockers, even 
if it is against their medical advice; 
forces employers to cover sex reassign-
ment surgeries; forces schools, church-
es, hospitals, and businesses to recog-
nize a chosen gender. 
I could go down the list. But this is 
about power and control. It is the same 
thing about having a fence with razor 
wire around the people’s Congress, 
around this Capitol building. It is an 
absolute affront to who we are. 
In the Declaration of Independence, 
where we are talking about rights, gov-
ernment is instituted among men to se-
cure those rights. 
And the House of Representatives, 
supposedly the people’s House, is using 
the power of this body to step on the 
rights of the American people. And it is 
our obligation to defend those rights. 
And I can tell you this: We are going to 
stand up in defense of the Constitution, 
our liberties and the Bill of Rights, and 
the consent of the governed matters. 
You do not have the consent of the 
governed, my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle. You don’t. And you 
are pretending that you have got power 
that you do not have, and it will not 
end well if you pull this republic apart, 
thread by thread, and you have to look 
in the mirror and tell your kids and 
grandkids that this republic died on 
your watch. 
It is not going to because we are 
going to stand on the wall, the same 
wall that our Founders stood on, the 
same wall that those men at the Alamo 
stood on, and we are going to defend 
this Constitution in the name of the 
Declaration of Independence and the 
Lord that gives us the rights that we 
protect.

LAWYERS’ COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL 
RIGHTS 
Washington, DC, February 25, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under 
Law (hereinafter ‘‘Lawyers’’ Committee’’), a 
nonpartisan civil rights organization formed 
at the request of President John F. Kennedy 
to enlist the private bar in providing legal 
services to address racial discrimination, we 
urge you to vote for the Equality Act (H.R. 
5). The Equality Act would clarify that 
LGBTQ+ people are protected against dis-
crimination in access to credit. housing, edu-
cation, and employment under federal law, 
as well as to strengthen public accommoda-
tion antidiscrimination for all people. 
The Lawyers’ Committee strongly believes 
that the Equality Act is an essential step in 
fulfilling our nation’s commitment to civil 
rights for all people. Unfortunately, dis-
crimination is a persistent problem for mil-
lions of people in the LGBTQ+ community, 
particularly for those who also identify as 
people of color. Everyone in America, re-
gardless of who they are, is entitled to equal 
rights and should be free to pursue career 
and educational opportunities and live their 
daily lives free from discrimination. 
Black Americans and other people of color 
continue to face persistent discrimination 
while 
engaging 
in 
commonplace 
trans-
actions, errands, and tasks, such as shopping 
and accessing transportation like taxis and 
car services. The Equality Act would finally 
make this discrimination illegal, as it 
strengthens the public accommodations pro-
vision in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Congress 
must act now to pass the Equality Act to 
clarify and strengthen federal civil rights 
protections so everyone across the country 
can engage in public life without the fear of 
harassment or discrimination because of who 
they are. 
As Congress considers this important bill, 
we are committed to ensuring the Equality 
Act does solely what it was intended to do: 
clarify and strengthen existing federal civil 
rights protections for everyone in America. 
We strongly oppose any effort to weaken any 
existing federal civil rights law the Equality 
Act would amend. 
We urge you to vote for final passage of the 
Equality Act because no one in our country 
should be discriminated against for who they 
are. It is time for Congress to clarify and 
strengthen federal civil rights protections 
for all Americans. 
Respectfully submitted, 
DAMON T. HEWITT, 
Acting President & Executive Director, Ex-
ecutive Vice President, Lawyers’ Com-
mittee for Civil Rights Under Law. 
Erinn D. Martin, 
Policy Counsel, Lawyers’ Committee for 
Civil Rights Under Law. 
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, 
Chicago, IL, February 23, 2021. 
RE: ABA Support for H.R. 5, The Equality 
Act of 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the American 
Bar Association and its over 400.000 mem-
bers. I am writing to voice our support for 
H.R. 5. The Equality Act of 2021. which ad-
dresses the need to protect every American 
regardless of their sexual orientation or gen-
der identity. We offer the following com-
ments in support of the legislation and re-
quest that this letter be made part of the 
hearing record. 
The Equality Act will include LGBTQ+ 
people in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Over 50 
years ago, when this landmark civil rights 
legislation was enacted, a minority group 
was omitted; this needs to be rectified. Cur-
rently, the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals de-
pend on the state where they reside, and in 
close to 30 states, LGBTQ+ people are at risk 
of being denied housing, credit. services, 
public accommodations, education, employ-
ment, access to their children, access to fed-
erally funded programs, or jury service sim-
ply because of their sexual orientation or 
gender identity. 
There is bipartisan support for the Equal-
ity Act, and 70 percent of Americans support 
equal rights for LGBTQ+. When the Equality 
Act was introduced in the last Congress, it 
received unprecedented support from busi-
nesses and more than 500 national and state-
wide organizations. 
In 2018, the ABA adopted a resolution spe-
cifically supporting enactment of the Equal-
ity Act. Let me elaborate on our reasons for 
supporting this important legislation: 
1. The Equality Act will protect LGBTQ+ 
people from workplace discrimination be-
cause of their sexual orientation, gender 
identity, or gender expression. 
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits dis-
crimination based on race, color, religion, or 
national origin. The Government Employee 
Rights Act of 1991 prohibits discrimination 
based on race, color, religion, sex, national 
origin, age, or disability. They will both be 
amended to include, ‘‘sex, (including sexual 
orientation, and gender identity).’’ 
Every day LGBTQ+ employees, co-workers, 
and job applicants are subjected to discrimi-
nation in the workplace. Other social groups 
have been protected by legislation, yet the 
LGBTQ+ community has not been included 
even though their livelihood, careers, and 
quality of life are equally affected. 
The Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission (EEOC) enforces federal laws that 
protect job applicants or employees from dis-
crimination based on race, color, religion, 
sex, national origin, age, disability, or ge-
netic information. In EEOC v. R.G. & G.R. 
Harris Funeral Homes, the EEOC filed a law-
suit against Harris Family Funeral Homes 
on behalf of Aimee Stephens, a transgender 
woman who was fired shortly after telling 
her employer she was transgender. The Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that 
Title VII prohibits discrimination based on 
gender identity, thus applying to businesses 
claiming exemption based on anti-LGBTQ+ 
religious beliefs. In 2020, the Supreme Court 
of the United States heard Harris consoli-
dated with Bostock v. Clayton County, and 
in a landmark ruling, upheld the Sixth Cir-
cuit decision affirming that LGBTQ+ em-
ployees are entitled to legal protections 
against discrimination on the basis of gender 
identity and sexual orientation under Title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
The Equality Act will codify this case law 
making discrimination against LGBTQ+ peo-
ple in the workplace unlawful by explicitly 
stating that sexual orientation and gender 
identity are protected traits. 
2. The Equality Act will prevent LGBTQ+ 
people from being denied services and public 
accommodations because of their sexual ori-
entation, gender identity, or gender expres-
sion. 
Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 pro-
hibits discrimination in public accommoda-
tions based on race, color, religion, or na-
tional origin. However, it is currently legal 
in almost 30 states to deny LGBTQ+ people 
services without cause and bar them from 
public accommodations such as hotels, res-
taurants, and libraries. 
In Grimm v. Gloucester County School 
Board, school board policy prohibited plain-
tiff from using the restrooms that aligned 
with his gender identity. In 2015, Grimm filed 
a lawsuit challenging the policy, on the 
grounds that it violates his rights under 
Title IX and the Fourteenth Amendment. 
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held 
that the school board’s restroom policy con-
stitutes sex-based discrimination, and that 
transgender individuals constitute a quasi- 
suspect class. Applying heightened scrutiny, 
the court held that the school board’s policy 
is not substantially related to its important 
interest in protecting students’ privacy and 
that, in regard to the Title IX claims, the 
restroom policy discriminated against plain-
tiff on the basis of sex, and that he suffered 
legally cognizable harm based on the unlaw-
ful discrimination. The Equality Act is nec-
essary to codify this ruling for the entire

country. Denying public accommodations to 
LGBTQ+ individuals is harmful to their 
health and dignity, and precludes them from 
fully participating in public life. 
In addition to places of public accommoda-
tion already included in the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act, the Equality Act will revise the law to 
ensure that other providers of products, serv-
ices, and public accommodations, such as 
stores, accountant firms, transportation, and 
banks, may not discriminate against a pro-
tected social group. 
3. The Equality Act will prevent LGBTQ+ 
people from being denied or evicted from 
housing based on their sexual orientation, 
gender identity, or gender expression. 
The Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1968, prohibits discrimi-
nation in the sale, rental, or financing of 
housing by landlords, real estate agents, mu-
nicipalities, banks, other lending institu-
tions, and homeowner’s insurance companies 
based on race, color, national origin, reli-
gion, sex, family status, or disability. 
LGBTQ+ individuals may be rejected when 
trying to purchase or rent a home. LGBTQ+ 
people can face eviction, which may have fi-
nancial and legal consequences. A partner’s 
request to be added to the insurance of a 
homeowner may be rejected which could af-
fect the property title. 
In Smith v. Avanti, a landlord in Colorado 
refused to rent to a same-sex couple, one of 
whom was also transgender. The United 
States District Court stated that the prop-
erty owner violated the Colorado Anti-Dis-
crimination Act. This was the first time a 
federal court, placing sexual orientation and 
gender identity under the umbrella of sex 
discrimination, has ruled that anti-LGBTQ+ 
discrimination violated the Fair Housing 
Act. 
Since homelessness is more prevalent in 
the LGBTQ+ community than in the general 
population, enactment of the Equality Act 
can help lower rates of housing insecurity. 
4. The Equality Act will ensure that 
LGBTQ+ individuals are not denied credit 
based on their sexual orientation, gender 
identity, or gender expression. 
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) 
prohibits 
discrimination 
based 
on 
race, 
color, religion, national origin, sex, marital 
status, or age with respect to credit trans-
actions. The Equality Act will amend ECOA 
to include ‘‘sexual orientation’’ and ‘‘gender 
identity’’ as protected classes. 
LGBTQ+ individuals are often denied cred-
it and mortgages. The negative financial im-
pact can mean that they are often unable to 
become homeowners, pursue higher edu-
cation or vocational training, build assets, 
or purchase a car. By amending ECOA, the 
Equality Act will allow for equal access to 
credit, financial improvements, education, 
and affordable housing. 
5. The Equality Act will protect LGBTQ+ 
people from discrimination in jury service. 
The Equal Protection Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment protects the right of a 
criminal defendant to a jury selection proc-
ess free from racial, ethnic, or gender dis-
crimination. When LGBTQ+ people are un-
fairly dismissed from jury service, there is 
no recourse in the justice system. 
The Equality Act will protect the integrity 
of the jury selection process for the defend-
ant, as well as the rights of the LGBTQ+ ju-
rors. 
The American Bar Association believes 
that everyone deserves equal protection 
under the law. Nearly two-thirds of LGBTQ+ 
Americans reported that they have experi-
enced discrimination in their everyday lives. 
We urge Congress to pass legislation explic-
itly affirming that discrimination due to 
sexual orientation, gender identity or ex-
pression, or sex stereotyping, is sex discrimi-
nation prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, among other federal statutes, and to in-
clude sex, sexual orientation, and gender 
identity or expression protections in those 
statutes. 
Thank you for this opportunity to convey 
the ABA’s position on this important legisla-
tion. 
Sincerely, 
PATRICIA LEE REFO.

NATIONAL COUNCIL 
OF JEWISH WOMEN, 
Washington, DC, February 24, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: I am writing on be-
half of the 180,000 volunteers and advocates 
of the National Council of Jewish Women 
(NCJW) to urge you to vote for HR 5, the 
Equality Act. NCJW believes in kavod 
habriyot, individual dignity. To that end, we 
are committed to the enactment, enforce-
ment, and preservation of laws and regula-
tions that protect civil rights and individual 
liberties for all. 
The Equality Act, which passed the House 
of Representatives in the last Congress, 
would add explicit protections against dis-
crimination based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity to our civil rights laws. The 
bill would also add and expand legal protec-
tions for women, people of color, and many 
other communities. Congress must pass the 
Equality Act to protect all individuals from 
discrimination regardless of sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity. 
A majority of LGBTQ people have experi-
enced harassment or discrimination due to 
their sexual orientation or gender identity. 
A 2020 study by the University of Chicago 
found that one in three LGBTQ Americans 
faced identity-based discrimination of some 
kind in the past year, with that number in-
creasing to three in five for transgender peo-
ple. Discrimination happens in the spheres of 
employment, education, housing, public ac-
commodations, and health care—every part 
of a person’s life. LGBTQ people of color, im-
migrants, legal minors, and those with dis-
abilities face even more barriers and biases. 
NCJW supports the Equality Act not in 
spite of our religious beliefs, but because of 
them. We believe in the inherent dignity and 
worth of all people, including religiously and 
non-religiously affiliated people. Civil rights 
protections go hand in hand with religious 
freedom, and the bill does not require any 
person to change their religious beliefs nor 
does it compel religious institutions to par-
ticipate in activities that violate the tenets 
of their faith. 
All people deserve to live free from dis-
crimination and fear regardless of their sex, 
sexual orientation, and gender identity. I 
urge you to vote for final passage of the 
Equality Act. 
Sincerely, 
JODY RABHAN, 
Chief Policy Officer, 
National Council of Jewish Women. 
FEBRUARY 24, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: The undersigned trade and professional 
associations write in support of H.R. 5, the 
Equality Act. Equality of opportunity is a 
key pillar of our great democracy—one that 
allows all people to pursue their American 
Dream—and part of what makes our nation 
exceptional. Our industries, representing and 
employing tens of millions of Americans, un-
derstand this basic fact and have been at the 
forefront of efforts to combat discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity in the workplace. 
H.R. 5 would amend several provisions of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide af-
firmative, statutory non-discrimination pro-
tections for LGBTQ Americans both in the 
workplace and in the community. These pro-
tections remain vitally important even after 
the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. 
Clayton County. Only legislative action can 
forestall endless litigation, alleviate the un-
tenable patchwork of state laws governing 
this form of discrimination, and make clear 
that discrimination because of sexual ori-
entation or gender identity is unwelcome 
and unlawful in our society. 
In 2019, the Equality Act was introduced on 
a bipartisan basis in both the House and Sen-
ate, and it passed the House with a bipar-
tisan majority. We urge you again to support 
the passage of H.R. 5.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I now 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. STAN-
TON). 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Equality 
Act. 
In the fight for LGBTQ-plus equality, 
we have made significant progress. 
From Stonewall to the Supreme Court, 
there is no doubt we have come a long 
way, but the unfortunate truth is that 
in far too many places discrimination 
is still permitted under the law. In pub-
lic facilities, in education institutions, 
when applying for jobs, when trying to 
rent or buy a home, discrimination is 
still permitted under the law. 
Many States right now are actively 
trying to turn back progress or write 
discriminatory practices into their own 
laws, 
especially 
against 
our 
transgender citizens. We can and must 
do better. 
In Arizona, in any place in America, 
everyone 
deserves 
equal 
treatment 
under the law, no matter who they are, 
who they love, or how they express 
themselves. 
I fervently support the Equality Act 
because we are a Nation that believes 
all are created equal and that this 
truth is self-evident. Everyone deserves 
to be seen, to feel heard, to be wel-
comed and protected. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I now 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. SEAN 
PATRICK MALONEY). 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of 
New York. Madam Speaker, I was 
thinking about my kids as I walked 
onto the floor today, and I have just 
one question to those who today, with 
their votes, would seek to perpetuate 
legal discrimination against millions 
of American families, including mine. 
Why are they afraid to just say what 
they really believe? Why hide behind 
the ridiculous, embarrassing, easily de-
bunked 
arguments, 
falsehoods, 
fearmongering about locker rooms and 
women’s sports and religious practices 
that will never be harmed? Why not 
just say what they really mean? 
I tell you what, Madam Speaker, I 
will say it for them. Their real argu-
ment, the only honest argument, is 
that they believe LGBT people are 
morally inferior and that firing us 
should be permitted. They argue the 
longstanding protections we already 
provide in the civil rights laws for reli-
gious practice for some reason aren’t 
good enough. Here they demand more 
capacity to hate on gay people than 
they would ever claim as a religious 
right to discriminate on the basis of 
race. 
Would any opponent of this bill argue 
that their religion gives them the right 
to deny an African-American couple 
service at a restaurant? That is exactly 
the argument made on this floor 60 
years ago when others, making so- 
called faith-based arguments, sought to 
defeat the civil rights laws in the first 
place.

February 25, 2021 
The true argument is that their be-
liefs demand existing discrimination 
against LGBT people be allowed. That 
is their true argument. That is pro-dis-
crimination. 
Our argument is that discrimination 
is wrong and that it should not be per-
mitted, and that the exercise of reli-
gion here can be protected just as we 
do in every other civil rights context— 
no more, no less. 
It is no wonder, but it is sad, that 
they deny the truth of their position 
here. These same Members spread the 
incendiary lie that the election was 
stolen and play footsie with dangerous 
conspiracy groups who attacked this 
building. They tell us mask-wearing in-
fringes on their rights despite a public 
health emergency. 
They deny school shootings are real 
or that a plane hit the Pentagon. Let 
history record the vote today. One side 
votes for love. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I will 
read from the bill, page 25 of their leg-
islation. 
The previous speaker, Madam Speak-
er, is just flat-out wrong. Here is what 
it says: The Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act shall not—shall not—pro-
vide a claim or a defense to a claim 
under the legislation or provide a basis 
for challenging the application of this 
bill. 
They put it in the bill. You can’t use 
the standards set forth in RFRA that 
was passed. You can’t even use that as 
a defense. It is spelled out in the legis-
lation. 
As my colleague from Louisiana said, 
the very first right mentioned in the 
very first amendment to the Constitu-
tion, in the very first amendment of 
the Bill of Rights, is your right to 
practice your faith the way you see fit. 
And they put in their legislation: No, 
you can’t. No, you can’t. 
That is what is in the bill. That is 
why they didn’t want a hearing, as pre-
vious 
speakers 
said, 
because 
they 
didn’t want us to be able to talk about 
this in a hearing where you have testi-
mony, witnesses. They didn’t want 
that. 
They come to the floor, and as my 
colleague from Texas said, give this a 
fancy name while they are taking away 
American citizens’ most fundamental 
liberty, the liberty the Founders chose 
to mention the very first right in the 
Bill of Rights. 
That is why we oppose this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to this bill. 
Despite its name, this bill is not 
about equality. It does attack religious 
freedom, freedom of expression, free-
dom of association, and all the impor-
tant rights recognized in the First 
Amendment. This bill is about forcing 
the ideas and beliefs of the far left on 
all Americans. It is about government 
control over every aspect of your life. 
It is a remnant from the scrap heap of 
failed legislation from yesteryear. 
I believe that all Americans should 
be treated equally and respected, but 
this bill does not do that. 
There are lots of concerns to have 
with this bill, but today, I am going to 
just highlight two. 
First, this bill will have a serious and 
deadly consequence for unborn chil-
dren. It expands abortion and undoes 
current Federal law that prohibits the 
use of Federal funds for abortion. It 
does so by adding to include ‘‘preg-
nancy, childbirth, or a related medical 
condition,’’ which has been recognized 
by courts and the EEOC to mean abor-
tion, to the definition of sex. 
I am reminded of when I used to work 
at the United Nations and would at-
tend conferences throughout the world. 
The code language in the United Na-
tions documents, in international law, 
was enforced pregnancy. That meant 
abortion. That meant you could not 
proscribe abortion. This bill takes that 
same tack. 
This bill also states that pregnancy, 
childbirth, or a related medical condi-
tion shall not receive less favorable 
treatment than other physical condi-
tions. That is that same tack that is in 
international documents. This means 
that abortion cannot be treated dif-
ferently than other medical conditions, 
and therefore abortion will be pro-
tected by our civil rights laws. That is 
not about equality; that is about ex-
panding abortion. 
Secondly, this bill will negatively 
impact all Americans whose religious 
beliefs influence their actions. This bill 
makes crystal clear that an individ-
ual’s religious beliefs do not matter, as 
my colleague from Ohio just referred 
to. 
This 
bill 
specifically 
prevents 
Americans from relying on the Reli-
gious Freedom Restoration Act, which 
was a bipartisan bill in 1993 signed by 
President Clinton. 
This bill says specifically the Reli-
gious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 
shall not provide a claim concerning or 
defense to a claim under a covered title 
or provide a basis for challenging the 
application or enforcement of a cov-
ered title. 
How can you say with a straight face 
that this bill does not impede or stomp 
on someone’s right of conscience or 
right of religious worship? It is set 
forth. It is specific. Who can deny that? 
This bill, if enacted, will mean that 
Americans will not be able to act in ac-
cordance with their religious beliefs. 
They will be forced to set their reli-
gious 
beliefs 
aside 
or 
face 
con-
sequences. This is unacceptable. This is 
un-American. 
For these and many other reasons, I 
oppose this bill and urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I now 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES). 
Mr. 
JEFFRIES. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
some of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have spent this debate 
lecturing us about foundational prin-
ciples 
in 
this 
country. 
The 
foundational document of this great 
Republic is the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, with the words: ‘‘We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal.’’ 
Those words were eloquent in their 
articulation and complete in their ap-
plication. It did not apply to African 
Americans; it did not apply to women; 
it did not apply to Native Americans; 
and it certainly did not apply to mem-
bers of the LGBTQ community. 
Now, we have come a long way in 
America, but we still have a long way 
to go. The progress has been made, as 
the great Barbara Jordan once indi-
cated, through a process of amendment 
and ratification and court decision and 
legislation. That is what we are doing 
today. 
If you believe in liberty and justice 
for all, support the Equality Act. If you 
believe in equal protection under the 
law, support the Equality Act. If you 
believe truly, as my religion teaches 
me, that we are all God’s children, sup-
port the Equality Act. 
Love does not discriminate; neither 
should the law. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Equality 
Act. 
I am the proud mom of a trans kid. I 
will fight every single day for every 
trans person, every LGBTQ person, in-
cluding my kid, to explore and express 
the fullness of their gender without 
fear or risk of being fired, denied hous-
ing, or refused service because of their 
sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2020, over one in 
three LGBTQ Americans faced dis-
crimination, including over three in 
five transgender Americans. In the 
midst of a pandemic, nearly 3 in 10 
LGBTQ Americans faced difficulties 
accessing medical care, including over 
half of transgender Americans. 
The Equality Act guarantees protec-
tion under the law, no matter who you 
love or your gender identity. It was 
President Abraham Lincoln who said 
those who deny freedom for others de-
serve it not for themselves. 
So today, as we pass the Equality 
Act, we vote ‘‘aye’’ for Janak, for Evie, 
for so many thousands more of our 
kids. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. We say to every 
LGBTQ person: We see you. We hear 
you. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our 
chairman, and I thank Representative

DAVID CICILLINE for his tireless leader-
ship in leading us to this day. All 
Americans deserve to be treated equal-
ly regardless of their gender identity or 
sexual orientation. 
I do have to wonder, Mr. Speaker, 
what are those on the other side who 
are arguing against this wise legisla-
tion afraid of? Equal treatment for 
their LGBTQ family and friends? Why 
would they make such arguments? 
We must continue to strive for the 
equality of the LGBTQ community. 
Voting ‘‘yes’’ on the Equality Act fur-
thers this fight and helps us live up to 
the promise of this Nation. As Bayard 
Rustin, an openly gay Black civil 
rights leader, said: ‘‘Let us be enraged 
about injustice, but let us not be de-
stroyed by it.’’ 
The Equality Act is a necessary step 
in addressing injustice by advancing 
the rights of Americans nationwide be-
cause we are all God’s children. The 
passage of this legislation is an impor-
tant step in forming a more perfect 
Union. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN), 
and I ask unanimous consent that she 
may control that balance. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York). 
Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, for 
years we have been hearing what we 
are hearing today: Look, we just want 
the same rights everybody else has. 
But we also heard for years: We just 
want to live and let live. 
I have got news for all of my friends 
across the aisle that don’t know. There 
is a right to the marriage you are 
claiming you need this bill for that the 
Supreme Court has already said you 
have. It is there. 
So what this bill, the so-called Equal-
ity Act, is really about, it is not about 
giving rights. This is about taking 
away rights. You have the rights. But 
this is saying that part of the First 
Amendment, ‘‘Congress shall make no 
law respecting an establishment of re-
ligion, or prohibiting the free exercise 
thereof,’’ that has to go. 
b 1415 
And just like my friend read from 
page 25, the Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act of 1993, that has got to go. 
You can no longer—after this bill, you 
can no longer use that as a defense 
when we sue your church, we sue your 
preacher. Male or female, it doesn’t 
matter. We are coming after you. If we 
sue a Rabbi, you can’t hide behind the 
First Amendment or this Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act. 
It won’t help you because we are say-
ing you don’t have those rights the 
Constitution gave you. That is all 
RFRA was to begin with. It was just 
codifying what was in the Constitu-
tion. 
I thought so much about my dear 
friend, the late Bishop Harry Jackson. 
He and I had stood inside this Capitol 
together for years trying to protect 
Christian rights. I miss Harry and I 
think about him a lot. 
And let me say, not as articulately, 
but for heaven’s sake, you have got 
these rights. Allow people who believe 
what Moses said when he said: A man 
shall leave his father and mother, a 
woman leave her home, the two will be-
come one flesh. 
Let them be able to practice the 
teaching of Moses. When Jesus was 
asked about marriage, he said—he 
quoted Moses verbatim. Please allow 
Christians who believe what Jesus said 
to practice that. 
Allow preachers who took oaths to 
practice it. Allow them to do that. 
Don’t take away the rights the Con-
stitution gave, and don’t take away 
decades of rights that women have 
worked for and earned and just give it 
away to men. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great day for America when we are ad-
vancing the civil rights of all Ameri-
cans, and that is what the Equality Act 
does. 
All of the free exercise constitutional 
arguments being advanced today— The 
SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman 
will suspend. Will the gentleman please 
put his mask on. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, all of the 
constitutional arguments being ad-
vanced today by our colleagues have 
been decisively repudiated and rejected 
by their hero, Justice Antonin Scalia, 
in the 1990 decision Employment Divi-
sion v. Smith, where Justice Scalia, for 
the Court, emphasized that there is no 
religious free exercise exemption from 
secular laws of universal application, 
including civil rights laws, including 
child labor laws, including child abuse 
laws. And every scoundrel in American 
history has tried to dress up his or her 
opposition to other people’s civil rights 
in religious garb. 
We saw that in 1964, in the Heart of 
Atlanta Motel case and in the Ollie’s 
Barbecue case, where motel owners, 
hotel owners, lunch counter owners 
came in and said: We have a religious 
free exercise right not to serve inter-
racial groups or interracial couples. We 
don’t want to allow an interracial cou-
ple—you get where I am going. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. OWENS). 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to the Equality Act. 
The issues discussed as part of the 
Equality Act are important. Amending 
the Civil Rights Act to include sexual 
orientation would be a historic step. 
Unfortunately, without explicit reli-
gious exemptions, there are many ques-
tions that will arise. 
Title II of the Civil Rights Act cur-
rently 
prohibits 
discrimination 
in 
places of public accommodation on the 
basis of race, color, religion, or na-
tional origin. 
The Equality Act would dramatically 
expand the definition of public accom-
modation to include any place of public 
gathering or any establishment that 
provides a service, such as food banks 
or homeless shelters. 
Every religion and faith in America 
has had its own set of beliefs. Some of 
these, including Christian, Jewish, and 
Muslim religions, are thousands of 
years old and answer to a much higher 
power. 
My personal faith, as a member of 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, teaches me that every indi-
vidual is a child of God and deserves to 
be treated with love and respect. 
My religion also teaches that mar-
riage is sacred and eternal in nature. 
The marriage ceremonies conducted in 
the sacred places of my faith are con-
ducted in temples that must not be 
deemed places of public accommoda-
tion. 
If houses of worship are defined as 
places of public accommodation, a 
number of problems arise, many having 
nothing to do with LGBT rights. 
For example, could an orthodox Jew-
ish synagogue decline to permit an 
interfaith couple from having their 
wedding ceremony in the synagogue? 
Could a traditional mosque conduct 
gender-segregated classes for youth 
programs? 
Could a Catholic church’s homeless 
shelter have separate housing for men 
and women? 
Could BYU or other church-owned 
universities continue hiring those indi-
viduals who follow its standards? 
Democrats claim the purpose of in-
troducing the Equality Act is not to 
impede religious freedom. In fact, 
Democrats claim that the existing laws 
are enough to protect religious free-
dom. 
But why, then, leave these crucial 
matters unclear and threaten people of 
faith? 
Why not accept an amendment to the 
Equality Act that clearly exempts reli-
gious organizations? 
Why remove the protections of the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act? 
The First Amendment right to prac-
tice our faith is at the core of our Na-
tion’s culture. Our moral compass of 
service, tolerance, kindness, and char-
ity stems from our Judeo-Christian 
foundation. No law should take us 
down the slippery slope of forgetting 
this legacy, regardless of its title. 
When Congress wants to protect reli-
gious expressions, it knows how to do 
so. The last major civil rights law en-
acted by Congress was the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. It contains a 
clear and explicit religious exemption. 
Why not make the law clear to pro-
mote civil rights and religious liberty?

February 25, 2021 
That would be the historic and uni-
fying thing to do. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, it is not 
often that this Chamber does remark-
able things. Today, we pass the Equal-
ity Act, which includes my bill, the 
Juror Non-Discrimination Act. 
This has been a long time coming and 
it represents progress that, for me, was 
unbelievable when I was growing up. 
You see, to grow up poor, Black, and 
gay is to not see yourself anywhere. It 
is also to feel completely unseen, as so 
many people around you invalidate 
your very existence. Growing up, I 
watched helplessly as opportunistic, 
straight 
politicians—mostly 
White, 
mostly male—used my basic human 
rights as a political football to further 
their careers. 
Had this legislation been enacted 
when I was growing up, it would have 
been direct evidence of the fact that 
things really do get better, that I 
didn’t have to hide or cry so much. 
Thankfully, since childhood, things 
have gotten better, but that hasn’t 
been because of the mere passage of 
time. It has been because LGBTQ advo-
cates made life better. 
Today, we send a powerful message 
to millions of LGBTQ people around 
the country and, indeed, around the 
world that they are seen, that they are 
valued, that their lives are worthy of 
being protected. 
How remarkable that is, Mr. Speak-
er. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just point out that a few speakers ago, 
the gentleman from Maryland used the 
term ‘‘religious garb.’’ 
A physician’s conscience, a physi-
cian’s faith, which compels him or her 
not to take the life of an unborn child 
is not religious garb. That is a deeply 
held position of conscience and posi-
tion of faith. 
Mr. Speaker, to have a Member from 
the other side raise that argument 
when we have specifically pointed to 
the First Amendment, pointed to page 
25 of the bill, which says ‘‘the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act will not 
apply,’’ is ridiculous. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Ohio for yielding, and I 
completely agree with him on his com-
ments. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 5, yet another harmful bill that 
has been rushed to the House floor 
without thorough bipartisan consider-
ation. It claims to strive for equality, 
but, in practice, this bill undermines 
the constitutional religious freedoms 
guaranteed to all Americans. 
Once again, abandoning long-estab-
lished House procedures, Democrats 
are pushing a conveniently titled bill 
without convening one hearing or 
markup during the 117th Congress to 
consider its vast implications for edu-
cational institutions and employers. 
This legislation would require our 
Nation’s K–12 schools to treat gender 
as being fluid, subjective, and not tied 
to biological reality. 
H.R. 5 also threatens religious free-
dom protections for all Americans and 
Federal funding for religiously affili-
ated colleges and universities. 
Under this bill, student codes of con-
duct, hiring practices, and housing 
rules that reflect sincerely held beliefs 
about marriage and sexuality would be 
deemed discriminatory, eroding First 
Amendment rights. 
In addition, the definitions in this 
bill are vague and would subject em-
ployers and other covered organiza-
tions to increase litigation risks. 
The bill also fails to advocate for the 
unborn, which is why I urge support for 
my amendment that will protect any-
one, including religiously affiliated 
groups and individuals, from being 
forced to perform abortions. 
Masquerading as a proposal to guar-
antee fundamental civil rights to all 
Americans, H.R. 5 is nothing more than 
a partisan ploy to destroy religious lib-
erty and educational opportunities for 
girls. Shameful doesn’t even begin to 
describe this bill. 
This is no way to legislate, but for 
House Democrats, silencing the voices 
of the minority and millions of hard-
working 
Americans 
is 
business 
as 
usual. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Ms. BUSH). 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis 
and I rise today in support of the 
Equality Act because all people deserve 
to live safely and freely. 
When we say that Black lives matter, 
we mean that every Black life matters; 
that Black trans lives matter; that 
Nina Pop’s life mattered. 
When we protect the lives of our 
trans family, our unhoused neighbors, 
our sex workers, our youth, we build a 
country where everyone can thrive, not 
just survive. 
For so many in St. Louis, this bill 
will be the difference between life and 
death. Missouri has not only stalled 
justice, but actively denied justice for 
our LGBTQIA-plus community. This 
legislation will mean the difference be-
tween having a safe place to call home 
and being unhoused because, to date, in 
the year 2021, that kind of discrimina-
tion still exists. 
We rise to tell our LGBTQIA commu-
nity: Not only do you matter, but you 
are loved and you are cared for, and we 
got your back. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman NAD-
LER and Representative CICILLINE for 
their work on this. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. CRAIG). 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to offer my support to the Equality 
Act, a groundbreaking piece of legisla-
tion that will grant equal protection 
under the law to our LGBTQ friends, 
family, neighbors, as well as to me and 
my family. 
As the first openly lesbian wife and 
mother in Congress and the first 
LGBTQ Member of Congress from the 
great State of Minnesota, I know this 
legislation is the culmination of a life-
time of work for so many. 
My wife, Cheryl, and I have built a 
beautiful life together raising four sons 
who we dearly love. We are fortunate 
to live in Minnesota, in a State where 
many of the Equality Act’s protections 
have already been enshrined into law. 
Right now, there are States across 
this country where it would be entirely 
legal for Cheryl and I to be discrimi-
nated against—based on our love and 
commitment to one another—in hous-
ing, employment, access to credit, or 
any other number of areas essential to 
just living our lives. 
b 1430 
Now, some of my colleagues seem to 
believe this legislation somehow could 
harm our non-LGBTQ women and girls, 
but that couldn’t be further from the 
truth. 
The Equality Act does not undermine 
the achievements or aspirations of non- 
LGBTQ. In fact, by amending the Civil 
Rights Act to prohibit discrimination 
on the basis of sex in a broad area of 
life, we are fighting to ensure that all 
women are treated equally in all as-
pects of their lives. 
The Equality Act is critical because 
when LGBTQ people have equality 
under the law, we all benefit and all of 
our communities are stronger. 
Mr. Speaker, as a teenage girl grow-
ing up in rural America, I never could 
have imagined I would finally see this 
legislation come to the House floor, 
much less as a Member of this body to 
see it passed. This legislation is nec-
essary, it is long overdue, and I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS). 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Equality Act. 
This landmark legislation will bring 
our Nation closer to the promise of its 
founding and will change the lives of 
generations of LGBTQ Americans for 
the better. This should be one of the 
easiest and most-affirming votes we 
ever take. Equality is, after all, a self- 
evident truth. It is part of the bedrock 
of this Nation. 
Throughout our history, the march 
toward full equality has brought more 
Americans of diverse backgrounds into 
the heart and soul of this country. To-
day’s vote is another important mile-
stone along that path. 
Americans in 29 States can be denied 
housing, education, credit, or other 
services, simply because of who they 
are. That this can happen in our coun-
try in 2021 is a grave injustice that

must be corrected with this vote. And 
by passing this bill, we can also send 
an 
unequivocal 
message 
to 
every 
LGBTQ American and their families: 
‘‘You matter. You have dignity. Your 
country sees you and has your back.’’ 
Growing up in New Hampshire, I 
never thought I could live as my au-
thentic self. Thankfully, I have a lov-
ing family and a welcoming commu-
nity who embraced me as a young per-
son, and I am fortunate to live in a 
State that has already added sexual 
orientation and gender identity to its 
civil rights statutes. 
But too many other LGBTQ Ameri-
cans live in fear of sharing their truth, 
and millions live in fear that the law 
won’t protect them from discrimina-
tion when they need it. 
Look, we are not asking for anything 
any other American doesn’t already 
enjoy. We just want to be treated the 
same. We just want politicians in 
Washington to catch up with the times 
and the Constitution. No one deserves 
to be treated as a second-class citizen 
in this country just for being them-
selves. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s pass the Equality 
Act. Let’s achieve full equality under 
the law, and let’s pass this bill with a 
strong, affirming vote today. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this 
law could not be plainer. It says gender 
is not a question of genetics, but of 
personal choice. And leftist dogma now 
calls for this doctrine to be imposed 
under force of law, and the effect is 
frightening. 
States that have adopted similar 
laws have threatened safe spaces for 
women and intimidated the free exer-
cise of conscience. But let me focus on 
just two aspects: How this destroys 
women’s sports and renders parents 
powerless to protect their own chil-
dren. 
Selina Soule, a teenager, worked her 
heart out and qualified for the Con-
necticut 
State 
championship 
track 
meet a few years ago. This is her expe-
rience: 
She said, ‘‘Eight of us lined up at the 
starting line . . . but when six of us 
were only about three-quarters into 
the race, two girls were already across 
the finish line. . . . 
‘‘What just happened? Two boys iden-
tifying as girls happened. 
‘‘Fair is no longer the norm. The 
chance to advance, the chance to win 
has been all over for us. . . . 
‘‘This policy will take away our med-
als, records, scholarships and dreams.’’ 
An anguished mother named Elaine, 
told her story: She said, ‘‘Let me ex-
plain to you how this works. . . . Ques-
tioning a child’s professed gender iden-
tity is now illegal. 
‘‘So, if a little boy is 5 years old and 
believes he is the opposite sex, affirma-
tive care means going along with his 
beliefs. Parents are encouraged to refer 
to him as their ‘daughter’ and let him 
choose a feminine name. . . . 
‘‘Is it really harmless to tell a child 
who still believes in the tooth fairy 
that he is of the opposite sex? 
‘‘If a 10-year-old girl is uncomfort-
able with her developing body and sud-
denly insists she is a boy, affirmative 
care means blocking this girl’s puberty 
with powerful drugs.’’ 
America, wake up. This is the brave, 
new world that House Democrats pro-
pose under the name ‘‘equality.’’ The 
parents of every daughter, who has 
ever poured their hearts into a sport 
should be outraged that their daugh-
ter’s dreams and hopes no longer mat-
ter to their own Representative. 
Every parent who would give their 
life to protect their child should be 
livid that this bill is about to replace 
them with bureaucrats who can admin-
ister puberty-blocking drugs on their 
child’s say-so. 
And every American should be scared 
as hell to realize the ideological extre-
mism that is now running rampant be-
hind the razor-wired militarized U.S. 
Capitol. It is hard to believe that we 
once called it ‘‘the people’s House.’’ 
Let this be a wake-up call to every 
voter. If you elect enough radicals to 
the Congress, you will get a radical 
Congress. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN). 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, now I had 
a different speech I was going to give 
today about the Equality Act. As an 
openly gay Member of Congress, mar-
ried to my husband, Phil, for 14 years, 
I was going to talk about the need for 
equal treatment under the law for ev-
eryone, regardless of who they love. 
Human kindness, respect for others— 
pretty basic stuff. But the new QAnon 
vibe in this body has gone too far. 
For many in this Chamber, this isn’t 
a debate about whether or not you 
should be legally discriminated against 
for who you love. You won’t hear that 
debate because they can’t win on hate 
alone. The public doesn’t agree with 
them. 
So instead, some are debating that 
this bill discriminates based on reli-
gion, which it doesn’t, because it treats 
everyone the same under the law. 
And some are debating an even sillier 
notion: That somehow a man will pre-
tend to be a woman to win in women’s 
sports—a crazy, made-up fantasy no-
tion. 
This new QAnon spirit across the 
aisle is also occurring in a nasty and 
hateful way. A lead GOP opponent of 
this bill actually posted an anti-trans 
poster on the wall outside her office di-
rectly and intentionally across from a 
Democratic Member of Congress with a 
trans daughter. Wow. That is classy. 
Mr. Speaker, really, is that where we 
are here today? Who can out-crazy, 
out-tastelessly act to prove to the base 
that they will say or do anything to 
score points and show how inconsid-
erate they can be to a colleague to just 
get social media clickbait? 
Here are the facts: One in four 
transgender people have lost a job due 
to 
discrimination, 
and 
dozens 
of 
transgender and gender-nonconforming 
people were violently killed last year. 
And LGBTQ youth are almost 5 times 
as likely to have attempted suicide 
compared to heterosexual youth due to 
discrimination. It is past time we put 
an end to this. A vote against the 
Equality Act is a vote for discrimina-
tion, plain and simple. 
Mr. Speaker, this isn’t Iran or Soma-
lia or Russia. This is America. Show 
human dignity for others by offering 
equal treatment under the law. That is 
the Equality Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding and for 
her leadership on this important issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to join our entire 
caucus in saluting Congressman DAVID 
CICILLINE, our longtime champion of 
the Equality Act, who has been coura-
geous, relentless, and persistent in his 
leadership for this legislation. 
We are proud to bring this important 
legislation to the House floor under the 
leadership of the most diverse House 
Democratic majority—nearly 70 per-
cent women, people of color, and 
LGBTQ, with 224 cosponsors on this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, as many of us were 
gathered together nearly 5 years ago to 
first introduce the Equality Act, that 
day in the LBJ room, on the Senate 
side, named after the President who 
fought for and signed the Civil Rights 
Act, we stood with an icon of the civil 
rights struggle, our colleague John 
Lewis, the conscience of Congress. 
The Civil Rights Act is a sacred pil-
lar of freedom in our country. It is not 
amended lightly. So how proud were we 
to be with our beloved JOHN LEWIS and 
the Congressional Black Caucus—many 
of 
whom 
are 
here 
now, 
MAXINE 
WATERS, Mr. GREEN, and others, thank 
you—as they gave their imprimatur to 
the opening of the Civil Rights Act to 
end 
discrimination 
against 
LGBTQ 
Americans. 
And we remember John Lewis’ life, 
we remember his words spoken at the 
Pride parade in Atlanta. Shortly before 
being diagnosed with cancer, he said, 
‘‘We are one people and one family. We 
all live in the same House . . . ‘’ 
Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to pass 
this landmark legislation, we must sa-
lute the countless advocates, activists, 
outside organizers and mobilizers, who 
have for decades demanded full rights 
for all Americans. Personally, my 
thoughts are with my friends, the late 
Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who 
shared their lives together for decades. 
I have spoken of them with their photo 
here on the floor year in and year out. 
They were members, as so many of us 
in San Francisco, who for decades were 
engaged in civic engagement on many 
issues, including those issues related to 
LGBTQ rights. They were an inspira-
tion, teaching us to take ‘‘pride.’’ And 
I say that with pride.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H653 
February 25, 2021 
When people say to me, ‘‘It is easy 
for you to support LGBTQ equality be-
cause you are from San Francisco 
where people are so tolerant.’’ Toler-
ant? To me, that is a condescending 
word. This is not about tolerance. 
This is about respect. This is about 
taking pride for Phyllis and Del and 
the older LGBTQ couples, for them, for 
LGBTQ workers striving to provide for 
their families, and for LGBTQ youth 
struggling to find their place, this is an 
historic, transformative moment of 
pride. 
Here in the House, this pride goes 
back for many years. When we first got 
the majority in 2006 and 2007, House 
Democrats had four goals relating to 
equality. Passing a comprehensive hate 
crimes bill—and when I say comprehen-
sive, I mean, LGBTQ—‘‘TQ’’. ‘‘T’’. Peo-
ple said to us at the time, Take out the 
‘‘T’’ and you can pass this bill in a 
minute. 
I said, If we take out the ‘‘T,’’ we are 
not going to pass this bill in 100 years 
because we are not bringing it up with-
out the word ‘‘transgender’’ in the bill. 
We passed the bill with the help of 
Barney Frank, our former colleague, 
and the family of Matthew Shepard 
who came here, touched our hearts, 
and got the votes to help us pass the 
legislation. 
Then we had ‘‘Don’t ask, don’t tell.’’ 
And under the leadership of President 
Obama and the courage of so many 
Members—Patrick Murphy, our former 
colleague and an Iraq combat vet lead-
ing the way here—we repealed ‘‘Don’t 
ask, don’t tell.’’ 
Thank you, President Obama. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
securing 
marriage 
equality was done for us by the courts. 
I took great pride in attending the oral 
arguments when that was argued in the 
courts, and what a victory it was for 
liberty and justice in our country when 
that decision came down. 
Our next item on the agenda was 
something called ENDA, ending dis-
crimination in the workplace. Well, it 
is really called Employment Non-
discrimination Act, hence the ENDA. 
But then with the successes that we 
had, it was, Why are we just talking 
about the workplace? Why aren’t we 
talking about every place in our soci-
ety? And, hence, came forth ENDA 
which became the Equality Act, fi-
nally, fully, ending anti-LGBTQ dis-
crimination 
on 
employment, 
edu-
cation, housing, credit, jury service, 
and public accommodation. It removes 
all doubt that sexual orientation and 
gender identity warrants civil rights 
protection in every arena of American 
life. 
Codifying the recent decision made 
by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 
Bostock case, it takes a momentous 
step towards full equality that brings 
our Nation closer to the founding 
promise of liberty and justice for all 
enshrined in the preamble of our Con-
stitution by our Founders in their 
great wisdom—also, in our pledge to 
the flag. And it is sadly necessary, I 
wish that it weren’t. Sometimes I just 
wonder why it is. But it is sadly nec-
essary because many members of the 
national LGBTQ community live in 
States where, though they have the 
right to marry, they have no State- 
level nondiscrimination protections in 
other areas of life. 
Mr. Speaker, in more than 20 States, 
LGBTQ Americans do not have specific 
protections against being denied hous-
ing because of their sexual orientation 
or gender identity, and over 30 States 
lack protections regarding access to 
education. Nearly 40 States lack pro-
tections regarding jury service. 
Mr. Speaker, passing the Equality 
Act in the last Congress was historic, a 
day of hope and happiness for millions. 
Now, with the Democratic Senate ma-
jority and President Biden in the White 
House and Vice President HARRIS there 
as well, we will pass it once more and 
we will never stop fighting until it be-
comes law. We will never stop fighting 
until the Equality Act becomes law. 
b 1445 
Let me conclude by returning to 
John Lewis and recalling his words 
spoken on this House floor on the pas-
sage of the Equality Act the first time. 
John Lewis said: We have a decision to 
end discrimination and set all of our 
people free. 
And set all of our people free. Today, 
with this legislation, we have an oppor-
tunity to set all of our people free and 
to advance the future of justice, equal-
ity, and dignity for all. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipar-
tisan vote for the Equality Act, salute 
Mr. CICILLINE and Senate MERKLEY on 
the Senate side for their leadership, 
and commend the distinguished chair 
of the Judiciary Committee for once 
again bringing this to the floor. Thank 
you, Congresswoman, for your leader-
ship on this issue as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER), the chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee, control 
the balance of the time on our side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, could I 
inquire about the amount of time re-
maining on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 161⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 193⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS). 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 5, the Equality 
Act, a critical piece of civil rights leg-
islation. 
Half a century ago, the Fair Housing 
Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act became law. But we know that 
housing and lending discrimination re-
mains a widespread problem. Former 
President Trump and his administra-
tion were shameful and cruel adver-
saries to justice and civil rights and 
worked to gut protections against 
housing and lending discrimination. 
According to the National Fair Hous-
ing Alliance, sex discrimination made 
up the fourth greatest basis for com-
plaints in 2019. As housing discrimina-
tion continues to harm an estimated 6 
to 8 million people in the U.S., LGBTQ- 
plus youth, in particular, remain at 
greater risk of homelessness compared 
to non-LGBTQ-plus youth, and same- 
sex couples are more likely to be de-
nied a mortgage loan compared to 
hetero-sex couples. 
This legislation takes key steps to 
codify existing protections for our 
LGBTQ-plus 
neighbors 
under 
civil 
rights statutes, including the Fair 
Housing Act and the Equal Credit Op-
portunity Act, and is similar to provi-
sions included in H.R. 166, a fair lend-
ing proposal by Representative AL 
GREEN. My committee has convened 
several hearings on this topic, includ-
ing one this week, about ongoing lend-
ing discrimination. 
I thank Representative CICILLINE for 
authoring this bill and Chair NADLER 
for his leadership. I urge my colleagues 
to please support this important bill 
that will ensure equal access to hous-
ing and wealth-building opportunities 
for generations to come by expressly 
prohibiting discrimination on the basis 
of sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a statement from the 
Log Cabin Republicans opposing the 
legislation on the floor today. 
LCR’s official statement: 
As part of the Democrats’ hard shift to the 
left, they continue to trample on the rights 
and freedoms of all Americans in the name of 
equality and ‘equity.’ 
Today, House Democrats are ramming 
through their latest version of the so-called 
‘‘Equality Act.’’ We opposed this legislation 
in the past, and we oppose it as it stands 
today. This is a partisan piece of legisla-
tion—it has no Republican cosponsors in the 
House. And the insidious nature of the ex-
treme changes it will make would irrep-
arably harm America and all of the accom-
plishments we’ve worked so hard for over the 
last few decades. 
Below, please find a complete review of 
this legislation from our editorial and re-
search teams at OUTSpoken. 
Let me be clear—Log Cabin Republicans is 
not now, nor will it ever retreat on our com-
mitment for equality for the LGBT commu-
nity—the transgender community included. 
We stand for protections in employment, ac-
cess to quality healthcare, and equal protec-
tion under the law for our trans brothers and 
sisters. 
But the so-called Equality Act goes to an 
extreme level to eliminate the concept of 
gender, which is absurd, dangerous, and way 
out of the mainstream. 
We’re going to work through this together 
as a community and a nation, but the Equal-
ity Act is not the solution. 
Thank you for your consideration we will 
keep you informed of developments as they 
occur.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H654 
February 25, 2021 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I noted that, at the outset, the bill 
sponsor, the gentleman from Rhode Is-
land, said that every community de-
serves to be treated with dignity and 
respect. Every community deserves to 
be treated with dignity and respect. 
The problem with this misnamed bill 
is that it does not treat every commu-
nity with dignity and respect. You 
have heard from previous speakers that 
this bill takes pains to say your ear-
nestly held religious beliefs are no de-
fense. 
What else does it do? Well, the basic 
way the legislation operates is to in-
sert or substitute for the word ‘‘sex’’ as 
a protected classification the phrase 
‘‘sex, including sexual orientation and 
gender identity.’’ If it did nothing 
more, it would be an echo of the 
Bostock decision in June. But it does 
do more. 
It defines the term ‘‘included,’’ so 
‘‘sex, including sexual orientation and 
gender identity.’’ If you go to the defi-
nition section, ‘‘including’’ is defined 
to mean ‘‘including, but not limited 
to.’’ ‘‘Including but not limited to,’’ 
why is that? What else does the bill in-
tend to do that the bill declines to 
state? 
Most significantly, Mr. Speaker, is 
that the bill removes the play in the 
joints. Let me explain what I mean. 
Concerning the public accommodations 
title, Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act, which, by the way, didn’t cover 
sex, it defined what a public accommo-
dation was for the purpose of ceasing 
the 
discrimination 
against 
Black 
Americans in public accommodations. 
What it said was, and it had a lot of 
synonyms, but hotels, restaurants, the-
aters, those were public accommoda-
tions. 
That language is gone in this bill, 
Mr. Speaker. Instead, what it says is a 
public accommodation is ‘‘any estab-
lishment that provides a good, service, 
or program, including,’’ there is that 
word ‘‘including,’’ and there is a big, 
long list. 
So any establishment that provides 
any good, any service, or any program 
in our society is covered, but we are 
still not done because of the rule’s con-
struction. ‘‘A reference in this title to 
an establishment shall be construed to 
include an individual whose operations 
affect commerce and who is a provider 
of a good, service, or program,’’ any in-
dividual, the cake baker, the photog-
rapher. 
This bill flips the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 on its head. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. The 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 was designed to 
say: No longer will Black Americans be 
cut out of economic life in this coun-
try. And it was necessary, and it was a 
moral evil. This bill flips that bill on 
its head, and it says to every indi-
vidual: A condition of your partici-
pating in the economic life of the coun-
try is that you buy all in, you buy into 
this lock, stock, and barrel. If you do 
not, you will be cut out of the eco-
nomic life of this country. 
There is no dignity and respect in 
that. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman NADLER for yielding. 
‘‘We the people’’ is a bold opening 
statement enshrined in our Constitu-
tion. But for far too long, LGBTQ 
Americans have not been included in 
that statement. 
A gay couple can get married in all 50 
States. A trans worker has legal pro-
tections from discrimination in the 
workplace. But despite this progress, a 
lesbian mom can be denied housing in 
most States because of her sexual ori-
entation. A queer person can be turned 
away from serving on a jury. 
In 27 States, there are no laws pro-
tecting people from discrimination on 
the basis of sexual orientation or gen-
der identity in education, housing, and 
public accommodation, and this is 
wrong. No person, no matter where 
they live in America, should face dis-
crimination. Equality should not de-
pend on the ZIP Code where you live. 
Now is the time for ‘‘we the people’’ to 
include LGBTQ Americans. 
My Republican colleagues are des-
perately trying to derail this legisla-
tion by cloaking their bigotry with 
high-minded arguments about religious 
freedom and appealing to people’s 
worst instincts with transphobic at-
tacks and grossly exaggerated exam-
ples. Their main argument seems to be 
that America doesn’t want a law that 
will protect the dignity of trans people 
who get murdered and beat up for being 
who they are. 
In reality, trans people are among 
those in our community who need this 
protection the most. Republicans want 
to vilify people who are the most se-
vere victims of injustice. 
What this law does is simple and just. 
It guarantees that LGBTQ people in 
every State cannot be discriminated 
against because of their identity. We 
have a moral imperative to get the 
Equality Act signed into law. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. As a child 
of the Bronx who grew up in the 
projects, I was often too scared to come 
out of the closet, too blinded by fear to 
see clearly my own value, my own 
equality. My younger self could have 
never imagined standing on the floor of 
the House as a Member of Congress, 
voting for legislation that, if enacted, 
would make me equal in the eyes of the 
law. 
As the first LGBTQ Afro-Latino 
Member of Congress, I feel palpably the 
weight of history on my shoulders. On 
behalf of my community, I am here to 
claim 
what 
discrimination 
denies: 
equal protection under the law. 
Indeed, we are here to uphold the 
abiding truth of the American experi-
ment, that we are all created equal and 
that none of us should be evicted, fired, 
or denied accommodations and services 
simply because of who we are and be-
cause of whom we love. 
We are equal by nature, and we ought 
to be equal by law. The logic of equal-
ity is as simple as that. 
Yesterday, a Member of Congress 
said that the Equality Act was ‘‘dis-
gusting, evil, immoral.’’ I wish to set 
the record straight. 
What is truly immoral and disgusting 
and evil is discrimination. It always 
has been, and it always will be. Dis-
crimination denies us our deepest hu-
manity. The profound degradation it 
causes has no place in a society that 
pledges liberty and justice for all. 
So I hope that my colleagues, all of 
them, will find the moral courage to 
uphold what the Declaration of Inde-
pendence promises and what the Equal-
ity Act delivers: life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness for all of us, with-
out exception, without discrimination. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. STEUBE). 
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, unlike 
most speeches you will hear on this 
floor today, I am going to start with 
the truth. 
Deuteronomy 22:5 states: A woman 
must not wear men’s clothing, nor a 
man wear women’s clothing, for the 
Lord your God detests anyone who does 
this. 
Now, this verse isn’t concerned about 
clothing styles but with people deter-
mining their own sexual identities. It 
is not clothing or personal style that 
offends God but, rather, the use of 
one’s appearance to act out or take on 
a sexual identity different from the one 
biologically assigned by God at birth. 
In his wisdom, God intentionally made 
each individual uniquely either male or 
female. 
b 1500 
When men or women claim to be able 
to choose their own sexual identity, 
they are making a statement that God 
did not know what he was doing when 
he created them. I am going to quote 
directly from Dr. Tony Evans’ com-
mentary Bible on this passage of Scrip-
ture: ‘‘Men and women equally share in 
bearing the image of God, but he has 
designed them to be distinct from and 
complementary toward one another. 
The gender confusion that exists in our 
culture today is a clear rejection of 
God’s good design. Whenever a nation’s 
laws no longer reflect the standards of 
God, that nation is in rebellion against

him and will inevitably bear the con-
sequences.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to read that 
line again. ‘‘Whenever a nation’s laws 
no longer reflect the standards of God, 
that nation is in rebellion against him 
and will inevitably bear the con-
sequences.’’ I think we are seeing the 
consequences of rejecting God here in 
our country today, and this bill speaks 
directly against what is laid out in 
Scripture. 
Our government, through this bill, is 
going to redefine what a woman is and 
what a man is. It can be anyone who 
identifies in that gender at any time. 
You are going to singlehandedly end 
women’s sports and all the gains for 
women’s rights contained in Title IX 
that was passed in this body since 1972. 
Singlehandedly 
destroying 
women’s 
sports in the name of equality, how 
ironic. 
If biological men compete in women’s 
sports, then it is no longer women’s 
sports at all. We might as well just 
have one sports team per event, and 
women, 
transgender 
women, 
men, 
transgender 
men 
can 
all 
compete 
against each other. How is that for 
equality? 
If biological differences didn’t mat-
ter, we would never have created and 
funded separate teams for men and 
women. We know that science supports 
the idea that there are performance 
differences between biological men and 
women in competitive sports, and it is 
just common sense to the vast major-
ity of Americans, just not common 
sense to this Democratic majority. 
In Connecticut, three high school fe-
male track runners have had to file a 
lawsuit because their Title IX protec-
tions were violated by biological male 
athletes competing against them. They 
had no choice but to file suit after they 
were forced to compete against biologi-
cal male athletes, and after those bio-
logical male athletes brought home 15 
women’s State championship titles. I 
could stand up here and give you exam-
ple after example of this happening 
throughout our country in all sports 
categories, but I don’t have near the 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, if you want to protect 
women’s sports, then vote against this 
bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. STEUBE, what any 
religious tradition ascribes as God’s 
will is no concern of this Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are advised to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK). 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, a few years ago, at a townhall 
in my district, a young student asked 
me: What is Congress going to do to 
protect trans people like me? He brave-
ly stood before an auditorium of neigh-
bors and told me he was terrified by 
the bigotry and discrimination against 
him and his LGBTQ-plus community 
members. 
I have heard these fears expressed by 
my own nonbinary child. Their fears 
are not misplaced. Our LGBTQ neigh-
bors face discrimination in healthcare, 
housing, education, and employment. 
Even here, in the people’s House, Mem-
bers 
of 
Congress 
are 
describing 
transgender people as something less 
than, as undeserving, and illegitimate. 
Today, our vote for the Equality Act 
says to every person that you matter, 
that you deserve to live your truth 
with respect and dignity, that there 
will be no true freedom for anyone 
until there is equality for everyone. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Mr. Speaker. 
You 
used 
God 
to 
enslave 
my 
foreparents. You used God to segregate 
me in schools. You used God to put me 
in the back of the bus. 
Have you no shame? God created 
every person in this room. Are you say-
ing that God made a mistake? 
This is not about God; it is about 
men 
who 
choose 
to 
discriminate 
against other people because they have 
the power to do so. 
My record will not show that I voted 
against Mr. CICILLINE having his rights. 
My record will show that when I had 
the opportunity to deliver liberty and 
justice for all, I voted for rights for all. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
think anyone uses God. We have just 
cited what is in the legislation, which 
specifically says the Religious Free-
dom Restoration Act shall not provide 
a defense against what this bill is 
doing. That is all we have done. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 31⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVID-
SON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, the so- 
called Equality Act is not about toler-
ance. It seeks to impose the will of this 
body on the American people in viola-
tion of the Constitution. 
It establishes a woke heresy code, 
seeking to eliminate distinctions be-
tween male and female at every level. 
It cancels women’s and girls’ sports, re-
quiring that biological males compete 
for their records, championships, and 
scholarships. 
It nullifies the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act. Rather than preserve 
the constitutionally protected freedom 
to disagree, disguised as equality, it 
compels participation on your terms 
for abortions, weddings, and all of reli-
gious, vocational, and civic life. It pur-
sues what Hillary Clinton said in 2016: 
You will just have to change your doc-
trine. 
Let me assure you, that will not hap-
pen. Colleagues, we must defend free-
dom and defeat this bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today is a 
great day. Today, we send a clear mes-
sage to every LGBTQ person that you 
belong here, that you are loved for who 
you are, and that we won’t stop fight-
ing until you experience true equity 
and equality. 
We are experiencing a crisis of vio-
lence against our LGBTQ neighbors, es-
pecially 
people 
of 
color, 
and 
our 
transgender communities. Today’s pas-
sage is for Treasure Hilliard, for Paris 
Cameron, and for every LGBTQ person 
taken too soon by hate. 
When one in five transgender people 
has experienced homelessness, when 
transgender people have half the home-
ownership rate of cisgender people, we 
have a structural problem. By out-
lawing discrimination in housing, em-
ployment, education, and public ac-
commodations, we send a powerful 
message to the bigots, including those 
here in Congress, that their time is 
over. 
Listen very closely, and remember 
these words: We are winning. We will 
continue winning. Our will is unbreak-
able. Our love is so much stronger than 
your sad, pathetic hate. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, can I in-
quire about the amount of time left for 
each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 83⁄4 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 11 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, near-
ly half of all LGBTQ people in America 
lack protections from discrimination 
in employment, education, housing, 
public accommodations, and credit. 
This is an abject failure to recognize 
the humanity and dignity in all of us. 
And, as I have spoken on before as the 
chairwoman of the House Small Busi-
ness Committee, discrimination is bad 
for business. That is why we need the 
Equality Act. 
We also need to recognize the mental 
health impacts of failing to treat all 
people equally under the law. Discrimi-
nation is linked to increased levels of 
stress, anxiety, and depression. Until 
all are equal in the eyes of the law, we 
are allowing bigotry to silence and 
shame. 
So, today, I am voting ‘‘yes’’ for all 
those who have been made less by their 
government’s failure to protect them. I 
am voting ‘‘yes’’ for the nearly 2 mil-
lion LGBTQ youth who are counting on 
us. I see you, and I welcome you in my 
heart. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Equality Act, im-
portant legislation that will secure the 
civil rights of our LGBTQ community. 
Our LGBTQ friends, neighbors, col-
leagues, 
and 
community

should not miss an educational oppor-
tunity, or be denied housing or credit, 
because of who they are or who they 
love. 
I was proud to help pass the Oregon 
Equality Act when I was in the State 
legislature. The same arguments were 
being made back then, in 2007, that 
some of our colleagues are making 
today. Do you know what came to 
pass? Those concerns did not come to 
pass. What happened? The law brought 
dignity, security, and peace of mind to 
the LGBTQ community. 
It is long past time that LGBTQ 
Americans across the country have the 
same protections. As the chair of the 
Civil Rights and Human Services Sub-
committee, I have heard from students 
and workers who were discriminated 
against, 
people 
who 
were 
deeply 
harmed by antigay and transphobic at-
tacks. 
Today, I am thinking about the trans 
people in Oregon and around the coun-
try who are bravely standing up for 
equality. We stand with you. We will 
keep working to create a world where 
you are safe, free, and supported. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
CICILLINE for his leadership. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Equality Act, and 
I associate myself with the remarks of 
the bill’s sponsor, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island. 
Because Mr. CICILLINE and my col-
leagues have already said all that there 
is to say about the clear merits of the 
bill, I would simply ask, through the 
Chair, that if our colleagues on the 
other side cannot find it within them-
selves to support this bill out of a sense 
of fairness and goodwill to those endur-
ing discrimination, then please do so 
out of concern for their parents, people 
just like our colleagues on the other 
side, mothers and fathers who love 
their children every bit as much as our 
colleagues love theirs. 
We want nothing more than to send 
our kids out into the world with con-
fidence and a reasonable expectation of 
being treated fairly and equally. It is 
never too late to do the right thing. 
Please join us in voting ‘‘yes’’ on the 
Equality Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the distinguished gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to be here today, to be on the 
record in favor of this legislation. 
No one should be fired from their job 
or evicted from their home because of 
who they are or who they love. 
b 1515 
This legislation will guarantee that 
our LGBTQ friends, neighbors, and 
family will be full members of the 
American family with all of the protec-
tions that come with that. 
Mr. Speaker, I will just say one thing 
before I sit down. For anyone who ever 
wondered what they would have done 
in those days in the early 1960s, when 
the civil rights legislation was being 
debated here, let me just say this: 
Whatever you are doing now is what 
you would have done then. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the last 
statement was ridiculous, and I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, as a founding vice chair of the 
LGBTQ-plus Equality Caucus, I am 
proud, once again, to cast my vote for 
the Equality Act. It is my sincere hope 
that this is finally the year that it will 
be signed into law. 
In dozens of States, including my 
own, LGBTQ Americans are still denied 
housing, discriminated against in edu-
cation, or denied service at businesses. 
The Trump administration ruthlessly 
attacked 
the 
LGBTQ 
community’s 
rights from the transgender military 
ban to allowing doctors to deny med-
ical care to LGBTQ individuals. 
States have continued to put forward 
so-called bathroom bills. Legislators in 
my own State have introduced bills to 
deny medical care to trans children 
and prevent trans youth from playing 
sports. Even worse, 44 trans Americans 
were murdered in 2020, the deadliest 
year on record. 
We can’t tolerate any more discrimi-
nation. It costs lives. The Equality Act 
is vital so that Americans everywhere 
can love whom they love and be their 
authentic selves without fear of perse-
cution, eviction, or discrimination. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I first 
want to agree with the bill’s sponsor 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) that 
discrimination is wrong. 
He went on to say the bill, H.R. 5, 
does no more and does no less than to 
give LGBTQ people the respect and 
equality they deserve. But I disagree 
because the bill moves us far beyond 
nondiscrimination and toward a place 
of one side over another. It eliminates 
mutual respect. 
Mr. Speaker, we can’t be so anxious 
to protect one class of people that we 
harm another. For instance, the bill 
forces churches in the public square to 
do things that counter their deeply 
held beliefs. It moves our Nation away 
from our Judeo-Christian values. It 
places women in sports, in domestic 
shelters, and in the healthcare profes-
sion at risk. It allows government to 
take an even more drastic step of mak-
ing decisions that should be reserved 
for our families. 
The Equality Act is anything but. 
Let’s not be fooled by the title. 
It would, likewise, force both people 
and organizations in many everyday 
life and work settings to speak or act 
in support of gender transition, includ-
ing healthcare workers and licensed 
counselors, even when it is against 
their 
professional 
judgment. 
The 
Equality Act would force healthcare 
providers to perform abortions and 
gender 
transition 
surgeries 
against 
their deeply held religious beliefs. That 
is not equality. 
Any parent who does not want their 
child to go through gender reassign-
ment surgery at a young and vulner-
able age would be stigmatized, and 
there is a risk that their child could be 
taken away or the life-altering surgery 
would be done with the blessing of only 
one parent. This diminishes the ability 
of parents to raise their children and to 
pass on their values. It is Washington, 
D.C., that ultimately decides the mo-
rality of our children and our churches. 
If this is truly about respect, then 
let’s start with it here in this Chamber. 
I must correct the record, and I take 
exception to being labeled as someone 
who vilifies those across the aisle. That 
is simply not true. No one on this side 
of the aisle has said ‘‘less than’’ or ‘‘il-
legitimate.’’ These are the labels being 
used on your side, not by me and not 
by my colleagues. 
If we want to do what is right by the 
American people, then let’s start re-
specting one another in this Chamber. 
Let’s start doing things that are for 
the benefit of the people. Let’s start 
understanding that we are here to pro-
tect all lives. All lives matter. 
But when we can’t stop fighting and 
discouraging each other in this Cham-
ber, shame on us, because we are going 
to do a lot better for the people who 
sent us here when we can start having 
civil conversation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are advised to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from the State of Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
One of the sad things that is hap-
pening in America, Mr. Speaker, is 
that the truth is so often being per-
ceived as fake news or that fake news 
is so often being perceived as the truth. 
Mr. Speaker, I am old enough to have 
worked for a United States Senator 
during the civil rights era. And I would 
get a publication—because I opened the 
mail; I had a hifalutin job—from what 
was called the Cross and the Sword, a 
publication that came somewhere from 
the South. I forget where its head-
quarters was. 
I remember reading how the Bible 
told us that we should not integrate 
America and that if God had wanted us 
all to be together, then we would be 
the same color. I perceived that then 
and I perceive that now as absurd. 
So I proudly rise in support of H.R. 5, 
the Equality Act, and congratulate Mr.

CICILLINE
and all those who have 
worked on getting this bill to this 
point on this floor. 
We passed it before, of course, and 
sent it to the United States Senate. 
They ignored it, to their discredit. The 
House passed this bill last Congress 
with bipartisan support. I hope we have 
bipartisan support this year because I 
remember, Mr. Speaker, back in the 
days of the early sixties and mid-six-
ties there were giants in the Repub-
lican Party who stood with Democrats 
on behalf of civil rights. I hope we can 
repeat that today because there is no 
room in America—it says here in 2021 
that there should have been no room in 
America from 1776 on when we said: 
‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evi-
dent’’—for legal discrimination. 
There are moments in our history 
that are celebrated for generations as 
those in which Americans came to-
gether to perfect our Union and to pro-
tect and uphold the universal rights 
enshrined in our founding documents. 
That is what we as a nation did with 
the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments. It 
is what we did with the 19th Amend-
ment where we said: Oh, yes, I know 
you are a woman, but you are going to 
be equal, you are going to be allowed to 
vote. 
What a radical idea that was and how 
long it took. 
We did it as well with the Voting 
Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act of 
1960. We did it together with the bill 
that I was proud to sponsor on this 
floor, the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. We said that it is not your dis-
ability that counts; it is your ability; 
drop the ‘‘dis.’’ 
We can do it again today with Mr. 
CICILLINE’s Equality Act, affirming 
that equality is for everyone all the 
time and everywhere. 
This legislation, Mr. Speaker, would 
ban 
discrimination 
against 
LGBTQ 
Americans in every area where it still 
exists and in every State that still per-
mits it. One nation under God, indivis-
ible. Not discrimination in the North-
west and discrimination in the North-
east or discrimination in the South or 
the Southwest. One nation—no dis-
crimination—fairness and equality for 
all. 
That includes housing, public edu-
cation, personal finance and credit, 
employment, healthcare, jury service, 
and public accommodation. The prac-
tical effect of such legalized discrimi-
nation is the denial of opportunities 
and 
economic 
security 
to 
certain 
Americans because of their gender 
identity or sexual orientation. 
The practical effect of this bill, Mr. 
Speaker, will be to open the doors of 
opportunity and economic security to 
those for whom they were shut for far, 
far too long. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
CICILLINE. I want to thank the gen-
tleman in the Chair for his leadership 
and courage. Both of them have dis-
played such worth as human beings and 
as colleagues, not by some arbitrary 
definition that we give to them based 
upon their sexual orientation or wheth-
er any of us, because of our gender, 
male or female, or our color, Black or 
White or yellow or red, one nation 
under God, indivisible. This legislation 
tries to recognize that indivisibility of 
the right of all Americans. 
I want to express my gratitude to the 
Congressional 
LGBTQ-Plus 
Equality 
Caucus, which has provided leadership 
both in shaping and improving this leg-
islation championing its adoption. 
The House will pass this legislation 
today, and then I hope it will not be 
lost in the politics of the Senate. That 
body has an extraordinary record over 
the centuries in terms of civil rights. It 
should uphold that record. I know that 
the Democratic Senate majority is 
eager to see it considered and passed. 
As I said, when I grew up in the six-
ties in the civil rights movement, 
many Republican leaders were giants 
in this effort. I hope the Senate Repub-
licans who have stood in the way of 
equality of opportunity for LGBTQ 
Americans for too long will finally 
come together with them in a bipar-
tisan fashion and allow an up-or-down 
vote. That is all we ask, an up-or-down 
vote. 
Frankly, that is not all we ask. We 
ask for 10 Republicans to join us with 
50 Democrats to make this a reality. 
Most Americans have come to under-
stand that ending discrimination for 
LGBTQ people is about the funda-
mental rights and dignity of their fel-
low Americans, and it is about who we 
are as a country, who we claim to be 
but for far too long were not. 
We know we are not there yet, but 
this is a very significant and important 
step for us to take in a land of oppor-
tunity for all and a land of liberty and 
justice for all. So let us affirm that 
today in this House. And I hope the 
Senate, in days to come, will join in 
that affirmation of justice for all, and 
let us make this a day to remember in 
our history as one where we came to-
gether to perfect our Union, as JOHN 
LEWIS would say, one more time. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
this so-called Equality Act is the cul-
mination of a 50-year effort by the rad-
ical left to attack our values, our fami-
lies, our children, and our religious 
freedoms. 
I ran for office as a Biblical and con-
stitutional Conservative because I be-
lieve in our Nation’s founding Judeo- 
Christian principles and the impor-
tance of faith and family to this unique 
American form of government. 
John Adams confirmed that this was 
the intent of the Founders when he 
stated: ‘‘Our Constitution was made 
only for a moral and religious people. 
It is wholly inadequate to the govern-
ment of any other.’’ 
I don’t think he could have envi-
sioned we would be here today defend-
ing the right to life for the unborn, 
what our children are taught in school 
regarding their own gender, the protec-
tion for people to practice their faith 
without fear of government, and the 
importance of the traditional family. 
This bill is one of the most dangerous 
and consequential bills that we will 
ever consider. It will have a terribly 
negative impact on every area of our 
lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject it. 
b 1530 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of the Equality 
Act, landmark legislation that pro-
vides LGBTQ people with the full pro-
tections of Federal civil rights law. 
Among many other critical protec-
tions that the Equality Act extends to 
LGBTQ people are housing protections 
for homeless youth who can be har-
assed, assaulted, or even kicked out of 
shelters based on their gender identity 
or sexual orientation. This is because 
27 States across the Nation lack 
LGBTQ nondiscrimination protections. 
At the same time, LGBTQ youth are 
120 percent more likely to experience 
homelessness. Protecting young people, 
giving them the resources to succeed 
early in life and keeping them safe and 
secure are all values we share. The 
Equality Act takes a massive step for-
ward to advance these values, reflect-
ing the tremendous progress forged by 
our Nation and those who came before 
us. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Tennessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER). 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the so-called Equality Act. 
Rather than delivering equality, this 
bill undermines protections for women 
and for girls. And simply put, women’s 
shelters should remain women’s shel-
ters and not allow biological men to in-
trude. And girls’ sports should remain 
sports for girls. 
This is not equal opportunity. This is 
catastrophic for girls’ sports. This is 
what the Equality Act seeks to over-
turn, and that is fairness in girls’ 
sports. 
All of this is even before mentioning 
the provisions that would undermine 
religious freedom. Religious organiza-
tions shouldn’t be forced to act con-
trary to their beliefs. This is why they 
call it religious freedom, after all. 
This bill poses a dangerous threat to 
free speech, religious freedom, and pro- 
life, the sanctity of life. This, honestly, 
goes against everything that I believe 
as a Christian and I will be opposing 
this bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. WIL-
LIAMS). 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, today I proudly rise in sup-
port of the Equality Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H658 
February 25, 2021 
Today, I am the voice of so many 
people, like my constituent, Chanel; 
my friend, James; my sister, Danielle 
and her fiance, Marlena; my staffer, 
Kristina and her partner, Vivian; and 
all of my friends back home on the 
front lines with Georgia Equality. 
For far too long, the inherent rights 
of LGBTQ people have hung in the bal-
ance. I am in Congress to ensure that 
everyone can share in the promise of 
America, no matter who they love or 
how they identify. 
LGBTQ people have lived in fear of 
punishment and retaliation for far too 
long. The right to exist in this country 
is not a privilege, but an inalienable 
right. 
I have the great honor of rep-
resenting Atlanta, a city vibrant with 
a long history of LGBTQ-plus pride. To 
my LGBTQ-plus constituents, know 
that it is my honor to represent you. I 
hear you. I see you. I stand with you. 
The promise of America excludes no 
one. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. WEBER). 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, 
this 
bill 
smacks 
of 
President 
Barack Obama’s transgender bathroom 
policy several years back. I remember 
that, how ridiculous that was. 
It was reported in Texas a young girl 
went into a bathroom in a package 
store, was followed by a male who said 
he self-identified as a female that day. 
More about her in a minute. 
This is not an Equality Act. This is 
going to erode religious freedom. This 
expressly exempts RFRA from being a 
defense if someone has a sincerely reli-
giously held belief. 
The comment was made earlier that 
we are using God as an excuse. I hardly 
think so. The Founders of the Con-
stitution knew exactly what they were 
doing when they provided for those 
protections. 
If the Equality Act is passed, individ-
uals 
with 
religious 
views 
will 
be 
disfavored by this bill and it will not 
have RFRA as a tool to defend against 
a violation of their religious freedom. 
H.R. 5 will politicize the medical pro-
fession to the detriment of the practi-
tioners and the patients. It is unbeliev-
able. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
CRAIG). The time of the gentleman has 
expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. I yield an additional 10 
seconds to the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. The girl that 
was followed into the bathroom by the 
gentleman who said he self-identified 
as a female that day, turns out that 
that man’s teeth were knocked out by 
the girl’s father who self-identified as 
the tooth fairy. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do we have left? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 31⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 21⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I get 
it now. This is all about protecting 
women. This intolerance is the Repub-
licans’ effort to show us how much 
they want to protect the rights of 
women. They want us to believe that 
protecting LGBTQ Americans somehow 
hurts women and girls. But they know 
better, and history will accurately re-
flect what it really is. 
It is an ugly, twisted use of femi-
nism. It is what it is. It is homophobia. 
It is transphobia. It is intolerance, and 
it is hatred. 
There is no constitutional right to 
hate. There is no constitutional right 
to exclude, and there is no right of con-
science to hate. 
Trans 
rights 
are 
human 
rights. 
LGBTQ rights are human rights. We 
must pass the Equality Act now. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, we have talked all day in here 
about discrimination, and we need to 
put some facts on the table. 
Madam Speaker, 0.6 percent of Amer-
icans identify as transgender. However, 
80 percent of Americans identify with a 
religious affiliation. 50.5 percent of 
people in this country identify as fe-
male; yet we consistently want to in-
fringe on the rights of all those other 
Americans for 0.6 percent of the popu-
lation in this country. 
Now, I have daughters, and I have en-
couraged them their whole life to do 
what you want to do in life; you can 
succeed. But we see, time and time 
again, that males are being put in com-
petition in sports directly against our 
females. 
My question is: Where are the femi-
nists today? Why are they not here 
with the Members of this caucus fight-
ing for the rights of females? 
We are going to infringe consistently 
on that 50.5 percent of the American 
population by allowing males to com-
pete in sports against them. 
Madam Speaker, 86 percent of the 
people in this Nation identify as reli-
gious people. We are going to allow this 
law and the overreach of the left in 
this country to start infringing on 
those 
people’s 
rights 
and, 
Madam 
Speaker, I have got to vote against it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair would remind Members to put on 
their masks. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I rise as the proud grandmother of a 
trans young man, and I just want to 
say that any family would be lucky to 
have the amazing and loving and smart 
and funny Isaac in their family. 
And I rise today to say thank you to 
the generations of people who have 
been arrested and beaten and excluded 
and sometimes killed for this fight. Let 
today be the end. 
I thank Congressman CICILLINE and 
all of those who have spoken today and 
are going to vote for freedom. This is a 
remarkable day, not just for my Isaac, 
but for all the young people who are 
frightened today. No more. We are with 
you. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I have heard a lot today about dis-
crimination against the LGBTQ com-
munity and them being kicked out of 
housing or whatever. No one wants 
that. 
But my question, Madam Speaker, to 
my friends on the other side was: 
Would they also agree that no one who 
disagrees with their views should be 
kicked out of their homes or lose their 
job? 
Should adoption agencies not be al-
lowed to continue operating if they 
don’t believe in that? 
Should houses of worship close be-
cause they continue teaching the tradi-
tional biblical values and principles of 
male and female? 
And I would suspect the answer 
would be no; that they should be fired, 
they should close, because the bill 
itself clearly states that religious 
rights and freedoms are not protected 
in this bill. And that is what is so dan-
gerous. 
This is a bill of tyranny, where gov-
ernment is telling people what they 
must believe and punishing them if 
they do not believe and do not con-
form. This is a dangerous bill. It codi-
fies in itself discrimination. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I have listened to 
this debate in amazement. I have been 
involved in this struggle for equality 
for many, many years. I was the chief 
author in the House of the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act, and to hear 
it suggested that I would turn my back 
on religious freedom is just ridiculous. 
This bill enshrines equality. It en-
shrines equality for everyone. That is 
its purpose. It does not contradict the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act 
which, as a number of people have men-
tioned, I was the chief author of. But it 
does enshrine equality, and that is 
what our friends on the other side of 
the aisle seem to be afraid of, equality. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 30 seconds re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
have the right to close. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, at the start of the 
debate, the sponsor of the bill said dis-
crimination is wrong. It sure is. We 
shouldn’t tolerate it. 
But this bill makes how a person 
identifies more important than equal-
ity; makes it more important than

fairness; makes it more important than 
fundamental liberties like your right 
to practice your faith the way you 
think the good Lord wants you to. 
And you would think a change of this 
magnitude would get a little more than 
90 minutes debate on the House floor. 
That is why we should oppose this leg-
islation. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
It is precisely because this bill en-
shrines equality; it is precisely because 
of the nonsensical nature of the argu-
ments from the other side of the aisle 
that the Equality Act has been en-
dorsed by more than 500 civil rights, 
women’s rights, religious, medical, and 
other national and State organizations, 
including the American Medical Asso-
ciation, the Central Conference of 
American 
Rabbis, 
the 
Episcopal 
Church, the Lawyers’ Committee for 
Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights, 
the NAACP, the National Alliance to 
End Sexual Violence—to end sexual vi-
olence—the National Coalition of Anti- 
Violence Programs, the National Wom-
en’s Law Center, the Network Lobby 
for Catholic Social Justice, the Rab-
binical 
Assembly, 
and 
the 
United 
Methodist Church General Board of 
Church and Society, all of whom obvi-
ously would not endorse this bill if it 
had anything to do with destroying re-
ligious liberty. 
It has also been endorsed by dozens of 
business associations, including the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers, 
and the Sports and Fitness Industry 
Association, and hundreds of other 
businesses. 
I urge all Members to support this 
important legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, as 
an original cosponsor of the Equality Act, and 
as a co-founder and Vice-chair of the House 
Equality Caucus, I want to voice my full sup-
port of this bill. I want to thank the Speaker 
and Chairman NADLER for acting quickly on 
this legislation. I also want to thank my friend 
Rep. CICILLINE, as well as my fellow caucus 
co-chairs, for their efforts. 
Our federal laws still do not protect lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people 
from 
discrimination. 
Almost 
two-thirds 
of 
LGBTQ Americans report having experienced 
discrimination—and LGBTQ people of color 
often face compounded injustices, including 
higher rates of unemployment and health chal-
lenges. 
The Equality Act prohibits discrimination in 
employment, housing, credit, education, public 
spaces and services, federally funded pro-
grams, and jury service. The Equality Act will 
help ensure that LGBTQ Americans can play 
their vital role in our nation and our commu-
nities without fear of harassment and discrimi-
nation. 
As a Black woman in America, I know what 
it is like to face injustice and inequality. I ap-
plaud House passage of the Equality Act as 
an historic milestone in our effort to build a 
more just society. I hope the Senate will pass 
it quickly and send it to the President for en-
actment. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 5 because it puts 
the Hyde Amendment and other federal and 
state laws that bar taxpayer funding for abor-
tion at serious risk and out of an abundance 
of concern for the women and children who 
flee to the protection of domestic abuse shel-
ters,. 
H.R. 5 weakens conscience protections for 
health care providers opposed to being co-
erced into participating in the killing of unborn 
babies. 
H.R. 5 defines ‘‘sex’’ to include ‘‘pregnancy, 
childbirth, or a related medical condition.’’ The 
term ‘‘related medical condition’’ means ‘‘abor-
tion.’’ In the case Doe v. C.A.R.S., the Third 
Circuit stated, ‘‘We now hold that the term ‘‘re-
lated medical conditions’’ includes an abor-
tion.’’ Furthermore, the Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces 
Title VII, interprets abortion to be covered as 
a ‘‘related medical condition.’’ 
To further clarify, H.R. 5 goes on to state: 
(b): Rules.—In a covered title referred to in 
subsection (a)—’’(1) (with respect to sex} 
pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical 
condition shall not receive less favorable 
treatment than other physical conditions; 
. . . 
In other words, a provider may not withhold 
a ‘‘treatment option,’’ including dismembering, 
chemically poisoning or otherwise destroying 
an unborn baby girl or boy. 
In a legal analysis released this month, the 
United States Conference of Catholic Bishops 
wrote: 
Existing prohibitions on the use of govern-
ment funds for abortion can be undercut in 
three ways. 
First, federal and state governments are 
themselves providers of health care. There-
fore, they would themselves be subject to the 
constraints that the Equality Act places on all 
health care providers and, as such, would like-
ly be required to provide abortions. This con-
clusion is reinforced by the bill’s expansive 
definition of ‘‘establishment,’’ which is not lim-
ited to physical facilities and places. 
Second, it would seem anomalous to, on 
the one hand, mandate that recipients of fed-
eral funds provide abortions, as the Equality 
Act can be read to do, but, on the other hand, 
prohibit use of such funds for abortions. It can 
(and likely will) be argued that these newly en-
acted provisions, which would likely require re-
cipients of federal funding to perform abor-
tions, would thereby repeal by implication pre-
viously enacted legislation forbidding the use 
of those very same funds for abortion. 
Third, even if the bill were not construed to 
require the federal government to fund abor-
tions, it could still be construed to require 
states that receive federal funding to do so 
with their own funds, which would be a depar-
ture from the longstanding principle that the 
federal government not require government 
funding of abortion even on the part of state 
governments. 
The possibility that the Equality Act may be 
used to undercut the Hyde principle against 
government funding of abortion has been 
noted even by those endorsing the bill includ-
ing Katelyn Burns, New Congress Opens Door 
for Renewed Push for LGBTQ Equality Act 
(Dec. 5, 2018). But instead of denying that this 
problem exists, or (even better) urging an 
amendment to avoid it, one supporter of the 
bill has suggested that the issue simply ‘‘has 
to be navigated super carefully.’’ In other 
words, there is a problem and the suggested 
‘‘fix’’ is simply to keep it from becoming politi-
cally visible. 
In an incisive analysis of H.R. 5, Richard 
Doerflinger exposes the risk to unborn chil-
dren, conscience rights and state all laws pre-
venting taxpayer funding for abortion: 
‘‘Of especially grave concern is that the 
Equality Act introduces this same language on 
sex and ‘‘pregnancy discrimination’’ into Title 
VI of the Civil Rights Act, forbidding discrimi-
nation in ‘‘federally assisted programs.’’ This 
applies to a wide range of entities that may re-
ceive federal funds, including state and local 
government agencies, educational institutions, 
organizations providing health care, etc. (42 
USC 2000d–4a). All of these would be re-
quired to show that they do not exclude the 
full range of treatments for the ‘‘condition’’ of 
pregnancy. Not only the federal government, 
but all states that receive federal funds for 
their health programs, could be required to 
fund elective abortions, reversing the long-
standing policy of two-thirds of the states. The 
same changes to the definition of ‘‘sex’’ are 
made to Title II, on discrimination in places of 
‘‘public accommodation,’’ and that title’s defini-
tion of a ‘‘public accommodation’’ is expanded 
to include ‘‘any establishment that provides a 
good, service, or program,’’ including any pro-
vider of ‘‘health care’’ (H.R. 5, Sec. 3 (a)(d)).’’ 
I also oppose H.R. 5 out of genuine concern 
for the women and children who seek refuge 
in a domestic abuse shelter. 
By granting biological men—who self-iden-
tify as women-access to women’s shelters, 
H.R. 5 removes the hard-fought gains to pro-
tect women and girls from abuse and to pro-
vide them with physical, emotional and psy-
chological security. 
In late 2018, nine female victims residing in 
a women’s shelter in Fresno, California-Nao-
mi’s House, operated by Poverello House-filed 
a lawsuit against the shelter for admitting a bi-
ological man because he had self-identified as 
a woman. These victims stated that they had 
been sexually harassed by this biological man. 
They said that he had made ‘‘sexual ad-
vances’’ on them and would ‘‘stare and leer’’ 
and make ‘‘sexually harassing comments 
about their bodies’’ while they were forced to 
undress in the same room with him. 
After repeatedly confronting the staff of Nao-
mi’s House—both verbally and in writing—with 
their extreme discomfort, these women were 
told that they would be expelled from the shel-
ter if they refused to comply. 
Madam Speaker, if we allow biological men 
who self-identify as women to receive access 
to these women-only shelters, abused women 
and children will lose the ’safe space’ they so 
desperately need. 
We must first and foremost protect victims 
of violence. 
These brave women and children deserve a 
place where they can feel protected and se-
cure, so they can begin the difficult process to 
heal as they deal with post-traumatic stress. 
Forcing them to share a shelter and its facili-
ties—including showers and sleeping areas— 
with biological men who self-identify as 
women will likely cause these women and chil-
dren to experience insecurity, discomfort, con-
fusion, and fear of additional assault.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H660 
February 25, 2021 
Women’s shelters—there are about 1,500 
nationwide—offer a safe space where a 
woman does not have to fear or worry about 
violence and intimidation and instead allows 
her to take steps toward rebuilding her life. 
These victims deserve better. They deserve 
our protection and support. We must work to 
ensure the safety of women, girls, and chil-
dren.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill,

hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources. 
The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
NEGUSE) and the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) each will con-
trol 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 803. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 5 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 803, the Protecting Amer-
ica’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act. 
I first want to thank Chairman GRI-
JALVA for his incredible leadership of 
the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee, and for bringing his Grand Can-
yon Protection Act to the floor today 
as part of the bill that we will be con-
sidering. 
I have been honored to work along-
side Chair GRIJALVA on the Natural Re-
sources Committee and I am looking 
forward to continuing that work as the 
chair of the National Parks, Forests, 
and Public Lands Subcommittee this 
Congress. 
The bill that we are considering 
today unifies eight standalone pro-
posals as H.R. 803, the Protecting 
America’s Wilderness and Public Lands 
Act. Representative DEGETTE, who is 
the primary sponsor, Representative 
HUFFMAN, Representative CHU, Rep-
resentative CARBAJAL, Representative 
SCHIFF, and Representative KILMER, 
have all worked tirelessly to advocate 
for the places in this bill, and I am 
looking forward to hearing more from 
them during today’s debate. 
Now, before I get carried away with 
the beauty of Colorado, I would like to 
acknowledge the product of our com-
bined efforts: 1.5 million acres of wil-
derness; 1,200 miles of protected wild 
and scenic rivers; permanent mineral 
withdrawals for the Grand Canyon and 
Colorado’s Thompson Divide. 
Each title of this bill considers how 
best to protect public lands and provide 
for local considerations. Together, they 
will improve access to clean water, 
clean air, outdoor recreation and, yes, 
they will even support jobs and our 
economy. 
Protecting public lands is a key part 
of the climate solution, and I am proud 
to say that we continue those protec-
tions here today with the formal sup-
port of the Biden administration. 
My contribution to this bill is the 
Colorado 
Outdoor 
Recreation 
and 
Economy Act, or the CORE Act. 
Through collaboration, consultation, 
negotiation, 
local 
elected 
officials, 
community members, businesses, out-
door 
recreation 
and 
conservation 
groups, ranchers, sportsmen, they have 
all come together to protect the out-
door areas in Colorado that we love. 
In many cases, Coloradans have been 
asking Congress to protect these areas 
for a decade or longer. In total, the 
CORE Act would conserve more than 
400,000 acres of public land, and each 
the CORE Act’s four sections were sep-
arately crafted by Coloradans. 
Camp Hale is one of the special 
places protected by the CORE Act. 
High on Colorado’s Continental Divide, 
surrounded by the White River Na-
tional Forest, the CORE Act would des-
ignate the first-ever National Historic 
Landscape at Camp Hale to honor the 
storied legacy of the Army’s 10th 
Mountain Division. 
The soldiers that trained at Camp 
Hale led our Nation to victory in World 
War II, then went on to create the 
modern outdoor industry, which today 
contributes billions to Colorado’s grow-
ing outdoor recreation economy. 
To similar ends, the CORE Act for-
mally establishes numerous bound-
aries, also a handful of National Park 
Service units without a formal designa-
tion by Congress, which would be in 
this bill. This long overdue designation 
will provide new fishing access, for ex-
ample, for sportsmen in the Gunnison 
River basin. 
And in yet another win for Colorado 
sportsmen, the CORE Act protects 
Colorado’s 
only 
migration 
corridor 
over Interstate 70 for elk, mule deer, 
and other wildlife. 
These areas are just a small sam-
pling, Mr. Speaker, of the many non- 
wilderness and locally supported pro-
tections included in this bill today. 
Additionally, the CORE Act makes a 
contribution of 73,000 acres to our Na-
tional Wilderness Preservation Sys-
tem. The CORE Act wilderness protects 
some of Colorado’s most iconic peaks, 
including two fourteeners: Wilson Peak 
and Mount Sneffels. 
And of the 400,000 acres of public 
lands covered by the CORE Act, about 
half is for the withdrawal and protec-
tion of the Thompson Divide. 
The 
Thompson 
Divide, 
through 
ranching and outdoor recreation, con-
tributes $30 million a year to Colo-
rado’s statewide economy. It is one of

our most treasured landscapes and an 
area that is simply too valuable to drill 
for oil and gas. 
The thoughtful input and collabora-
tion put into the CORE Act is apparent 
in each title of the Protecting Amer-
ica’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act. 
Now, my colleagues may have ideo-
logical differences when it comes to 
protecting our public lands, but what 
we can all agree on is that the United 
States is blessed with some of the most 
beautiful landscapes in the world. And 
it is thanks to the careful consider-
ation of the legislators that came be-
fore us and the legislators that are 
gathered here today on the floor that 
we are able to enjoy them today, and 
that our children will be able to enjoy 
them tomorrow. 
So I urge my colleagues to consider 
the decades of work that have gone 
into the bill that is before us and to 
recognize the chance that we all have 
to vote to protect these places. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 803, 
the Protecting America’s Wilderness 
and Public Lands Act. 
Contrary to the name, this bill will 
damage our environment, while simul-
taneously killing jobs in rural Amer-
ica. 
The proponents of this bill will say it 
is broadly supported. Listen to the 
Members who represent the districts 
most affected by this bill. They don’t 
want it. 
Listen to the groups opposed: Amer-
ican Farm Bureau, American Forest 
Resource Council, or the Grand Junc-
tion, Colorado, Chamber of Commerce. 
They don’t want this bill. 
This bill creates nearly 1.5 million of 
acres of new wilderness, withdraws 1.2 
million acres from mineral production, 
and designates over 1,200 miles of wild 
scenic and recreational rivers. For per-
spective, the wilderness designated in 
this bill is the same size as President 
Biden’s home State of Delaware. 
This Chamber has bypassed the com-
mittee process and circumvented the 
will of Members who represent districts 
directly impacted by this legislation. 
It was scheduled for the floor before 
the Committee was ever organized. 
b 1730 
The consequences of this bill on the 
four Western States it impacts will be 
far-reaching. For example, if you live 
in Colorado and you enjoy recreating 
on mountain biking and ATV trails 
like the people pictured here on the 
Tabeguache Trail, this bill will shut 
down your ability to recreate on those 
lands. The same goes for snowmobilers, 
OHV users, and parents with strollers. 
It is very concerning that these wil-
derness areas will now be off-limits to 
active forest management. 2020 was 
sadly another record-breaking fire sea-
son. We have a problem on our national 
forests that is not going to be solved 
with handsaws and shovels. Now is not 
the time to rely on century-old man-
agement techniques stipulated by wil-
derness designations when over 80 mil-
lion acres of U.S. Forest Service land is 
in desperate need of treatment. 
If that wasn’t enough, this bill also 
designates lands as wilderness in the 
wildland-urban interface. This is a 
matter of life and death. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to clear up some 
misconceptions about the last title of 
this bill, the Grand Canyon Protection 
Act. Nobody is mining in the Grand 
Canyon; nobody wants to mine in the 
Grand Canyon; and nobody will mine in 
the Grand Canyon—ever. Proponents of 
the bill would have you believe that 
this is happening right near the Colo-
rado River. In fact, there are already 
buffer zones in place. It is called the 
Grand Canyon National Park. 
The only saving this bill will do is 
saving Chinese and Russian uranium 
mining jobs. In 2019, we only produced 
0.5 percent of the domestic uranium 
needed for commercial reactors. This 
bill goes far beyond the park’s bound-
aries and the boundaries of the spon-
sor’s home district to simply kill jobs 
to the direct benefit of our adversaries. 
This bill will make us more dependent 
on 
hostile 
nations 
like 
Russia, 
Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, and Chi-
nese-owned mines in Namibia. 
In conclusion, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to oppose this terrible, hor-
rible, no-good, very bad bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, before I 
yield, I would be remiss if I didn’t say 
with respect to Colorado in particular, 
and with much respect to the ranking 
member, the Outdoor Alliance sent a 
letter to Chairman GRIJALVA just a few 
days ago in support of this bill. It was 
signed by the CEO of the International 
Mountain Bicycling Association, so I 
think they would have much to dis-
agree with, with respect to some of the 
statements that were made. 
Finally, I will also say, every bill 
that is a component of this measure 
was marked up in the last Congress, 
heard in the last Congress, and passed 
the last Congress twice. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Colo-
rado (Ms. DEGETTE). 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
proud to rise in support of H.R. 803, and 
I am so proud to be the primary spon-
sor of this beautiful legislation, Pro-
tecting America’s Wilderness and Pub-
lic Lands Act. 
The bill seeks to protect some of our 
Nation’s most treasured public lands. 
Not only will it help protect the air we 
breathe and the water we drink but 
also the wildlife that call these un-
touched areas home and the world- 
class 
recreation 
opportunities 
they 
provide. 
In all, this legislation preserves al-
most 3 million acres of public land 
across Colorado, California, Arizona, 
and Washington State. It designates 
1.49 million acres of public land as wil-
derness, giving these areas the perma-
nent protection that they deserve. It 
also protects an additional 1.2 million 
vulnerable acres from the threat of fu-
ture uranium mining claims in Ari-
zona, and it adds a thousand miles of 
river to the National Wild and Scenic 
River System. 
Preserving our Nation’s public lands 
is about more than just protecting our 
environment. It is about protecting our 
economy and our way of life as well. In 
my home State of Colorado alone, our 
public lands support a $12 billion—that 
is a b—a $12 billion outdoor recreation 
economy and hundreds of thousands of 
jobs across the whole State. 
Perhaps most importantly, what this 
bill will do is to jump-start our com-
mitment to protecting 30 percent of 
our Nation’s lands by 2030 to help com-
bat the climate crisis. 
This package includes eight separate 
public lands bills, as you heard from 
Mr. NEGUSE. All of those bills were 
heard in committee, marked up, and 
passed by this Chamber two times last 
year. 
I know that each of the individual 
bill sponsors plans to say a few words, 
so I would like to talk about title I of 
the legislation, which contains my bill, 
the Colorado Wilderness Act. 
This is legislation I have been work-
ing on for more than two decades to 
permanently 
protect 
about 
660,000 
acres of wilderness in 36 unique areas 
in Colorado. Most of these areas are 
low-lying canyon country, BLM areas 
that have been managed as wilderness 
study areas for almost 40 years now. 
As a fourth-generation Coloradan, I 
know how important these lands are to 
the people of my State, from the dra-
matic ridgeline of Grand Hogback to 
the sprawling plateaus of Little Book 
Cliffs, from the stunning red cliffs of 
the Dolores River Canyon to the wind-
ing riverways of Browns Canyon, the 
areas in this bill are some of the most 
beautiful and irreplaceable landscapes 
that our State has to offer. It is why 
the bill has received such unbelievable 
support from residents, businesses, and 
groups across the State. 
You heard from Mr. NEGUSE about 
the support. More than 14,000 people 
have written letters of support, and 
over 350 businesses. Now, I personally 
have visited most of the areas in the 
bill. I have gone on foot, and I have 
gone on horseback. I even went on raft 
to see them for myself. 
I met with landowners and ranchers 
and business owners to get their feed-
back. And when necessary, I adjusted 
the boundaries to address their con-
cerns. 
As I said, the Colorado Wilderness 
Act is just one of eight bills in this leg-
islation included in the package, and I 
want to thank each of my colleagues 
who are here today—Representatives 
HUFFMAN, CARBAJAL, CHU, SCHIFF, KIL-
MER, NEGUSE, and also, of course, 
Chairman GRIJALVA—for their unwav-
ering support and for all the work that

they have done to get this package to 
the floor. I want to thank all the staff 
from the Natural Resources Committee 
and our personal staffs, too. 
I just want to say that we have 
worked tirelessly on this legislation. It 
is so important not just for us but for 
the future generations who will come 
to these very special places, who will 
see the petroglyphs that I saw the last 
time I went out, who will see the Book 
Cliffs and the beautiful canyons. 
I think that protecting our un-
touched wilderness is so important. It 
is my number one priority in this Con-
gress, and I know all my cosponsors 
feel the same way. I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this important legisla-
tion. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude for the RECORD the following let-
ters from multiple organizations in op-
position to H.R. 803. 
INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION 
OF AMERICA, 
Washington, DC, February 23, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
MADAM SPEAKER: The Independent Petro-
leum Association of America (IPAA) is op-
posed to H.R. 803, the ‘‘Protecting America’s 
Wilderness and Public Lands Act.’’ This bill 
creates nearly 1.5 million acres of new wil-
derness and permanently withdraws 1.2 mil-
lion acres from mineral production. It is in 
direct opposition to the multiple use man-
date given to the Department of the Interior 
to manage the federal estate. Many of the 
local communities impacted by this meas-
ure, including Garfield County in Colorado 
which has existing 
mineral 
leases 
and 
planned for further development, have raised 
significant concerns due to the elimination 
of multiple use of the land and the overall 
threat to local economies and rural jobs. 
Further, many of the lands under consider-
ation in H.R. 803 do not meet the basic char-
acteristics for consideration as wilderness. 
Instead, 
the 
legislation 
arbitrarily 
des-
ignates areas as wilderness and wild and sce-
nic rivers despite official testimony provided 
by the relevant land management agencies 
to previous Congresses that many of these 
designations are inappropriate and not rec-
ommended. To declare areas that do not pos-
sess these characteristics undermines the in-
tegrity of the Wilderness Act and the Wild 
and Scenic Rivers Act. 
The process by which H.R 803 is coming to 
the House floor is also concerning. The bill 
did not go through regular order, receiving 
no hearings or mark-ups in the 117th Con-
gress. In fact, the bill was scheduled for floor 
consideration before the Natural Resources 
Committee had even organized. Local input, 
especially with regards to managing active 
mineral leases which affect jobs, should have 
been solicited in an effort to allow the House 
to better understand the broad impacts of 
the bill. 
For these reasons, IPAA is strongly op-
posed to H.R. 803. 
Sincerely, 
DAN NAATZ, 
Senior Vice President of Government Rela-
tions and Political Affairs, Independent 
Producers Association of America.

Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. BRUCE WESTERMAN, 
Ranking Member, House Natural Resources 
Committee, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
GRIJALVA
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER WESTERMAN: The signatories to this 
letter urge you to vote in opposition to the 
‘‘Grand Canyon Protection Act’’ (H.R. 1052), 
as stand-alone legislation or as part of the 
Protecting America’s Wilderness and Public 
Lands Act under consideration in the U.S. 
House of Representatives this week. H.R. 
1052 perpetuates false claims of mining in 
one of our nation’s most beautiful national 
parks. It also fails to acknowledge our na-
tion’s alarming reliance on foreign sources of 
minerals and would further weaken the al-
ready vulnerable supply chains for key U.S. 
industry sectors, including manufacturing, 
infrastructure, energy, and defense. 
Federal lands—predominantly in the west-
ern U.S.—are the source of much of our na-
tion’s mineral endowment. Of these federal 
lands, half are either off limits or under re-
strictions to mineral development. While 
mining is certainly not appropriate on all 
federal lands, maintaining responsible access 
to the very resources that drive innovation, 
feed economic growth and improve our na-
tion’s quality of life is essential. Given the 
vast amount of federal lands already closed 
to mining operations, caution should be ex-
ercised when determining whether additional 
lands should be placed off limits. 
H.R. 1052 targets more than a million acres 
of mineral rich lands, including world-class 
uranium ore deposits that are located well 
outside the boundaries of the Grand Canyon 
National Park. The park, as created, already 
includes a built-in buffer zone to protect 
park resources from activities taking place 
outside the park boundaries and an addi-
tional million-acre buffer zone is not justi-
fied. H.R. 1052 deliberately disregards our 
dangerous dependence on countries like Rus-
sia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan to meet our 
nation’s need for uranium to fuel our nuclear 
Navy and supply 20 percent of our nation’s 
electricity. 
Furthermore, H.R. 1052 ignores not only 
the comprehensive framework of federal, 
state, and local environmental regulations 
that govern every aspect of mining, but the 
findings of the Department of the Interior 
that the park was not at risk from mining 
given these existing protections. In fact, the 
U.S. Geological Survey recently concluded 
that the nine uranium mines that have oper-
ated in northern Arizona since the 1970s 
(since modern environmental laws took ef-
fect) have caused no adverse impact to envi-
ronmental or health. This unwise and unwar-
ranted mineral withdrawal is bad public pol-
icy that ignores the vast sectors of our econ-
omy that depend upon a reliable and secure 
supply chain of responsibly sourced minerals 
and metals. It also puts President Biden’s re-
newable goals at a risk, forcing domestic 
manufacturers of clean energy technologies 
to rely on increased imports of these mate-
rials. 
Access to our nation’s vast and diverse re-
sources and fair regulatory policies that pro-
mote certainty in the mine permitting proc-
ess are the elements of sound public policy 
that should be considered when addressing 
resource development on federal lands. We 
urge you to vote against this misguided bill 
and support policies that promote respon-
sible resource development. 
Sincerely, 
American Exploration & Mining Associa-
tion, Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Indus-
try, Arizona Mining Association, National 
Mining Association, Women’s Mining Coali-
tion, Wyoming Mining Association. 
NSSGA, NATIONAL STONE, 
SAND & GRAVEL ASSOCIATION, 
February 19, 2020. 
Hon. RAU´ L GRIJALVA, 
Chairman, House Committee on Natural Re-
sources, Washington, DC. 
Hon. BRUCE WESTERMAN, 
Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural 
Resources, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
GRIJALVA
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER WESTERMAN: On behalf of the 400 
members of the National Stone, Sand & 
Gravel Association (NSSGA), I am writing to 
express our concern with certain provisions 
included in H.R. 803, the ‘‘Protecting Amer-
ica’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act’’. Our 
members take extraordinary strides to re-
sponsibly produce construction materials 
and we oppose legislation that arbitrarily 
and permanently prohibit the development 
of aggregates operations on millions of acres 
of federal lands. 
NSSGA represents aggregates producers 
and those who manufacture equipment and 
services that support the construction indus-
try. Our members are essential to the work 
of this country, and we represent more than 
90 percent of the crushed stone and 70 per-
cent of the sand and gravel consumed annu-
ally in the United States. Our members em-
ploy more than 100,000 hard-working men 
and women and are responsible for the essen-
tial raw materials found in every home, 
building, road, bridge and public works 
project. 
NSSGA is most concerned with Section 802 
that would permanently ban aggregate pro-
duction on millions of acres of land in Ari-
zona. Such a ban would severely diminish 
the ability for communities to access key re-
sources that are necessary for building 
roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, homes and 
businesses. Allowing this ban to proceed 
would have a significant impact on the cost 
of public works projects due to the necessity 
for stone, sand and gravel required to de-
velop and repair infrastructure and buildings 
to be imported into the area. These products 
are expensive to transport and would further 
strain the budgets of local communities and 
federal entities that are seeking to make in-
frastructure investments in Arizona includ-
ing improvements to National Parks like the 
Grand Canyon. 
Further, permanently banning aggregate 
operations on these federal lands would 
greatly impact the region and our nation’s 
energy development. Industrial sand is a key 
component in energy production. Under the 
proposal access to these essential materials 
would be limited, driving up production costs 
that would likely be passed along to cus-
tomers—families and businesses that are fac-
ing uncertainty during the pandemic. 
While this legislation will clearly create a 
competitive disadvantage that has negative 
economic impacts for the families in the im-
pacted communities, it will also have signifi-
cant environmental impacts. Delaying and 
increasing the cost of improvements to con-
gested roads or eliminating access to a mate-
rial that is needed to develop a new clean 
water project and cleaner energy sources will 
have real environmental impacts on estab-
lishing cleaner air and water and access to 
public lands. 
Instead of taking broad, unilateral actions 
to withdraw access to these lands, NSSGA 
urges Congress to consult with local stake-
holders and communities to find more tai-
lored approaches to preserve treasured lands.

February 25, 2021 
NSSGA members strongly promote conserva-
tion in both their business practices and per-
sonal lives. Our member companies have ad-
vanced award-winning environmental stew-
ardship projects to build critical habitats, 
promote biodiversity and drive greatest ac-
cess to recreational activities. Further, as 
most NSSGA member quarries and plants 
have literally served as the bedrock of their 
communities of decades, they take great 
pride in engagement and are actively in-
volved to giving back to their local commu-
nities. 
Rather than rushing through the legisla-
tive process to advance H.R. 803 on the floor 
of the House of Representatives, NSSGA 
urges the Committee to move this large pub-
lic lands package through regular order in 
order to allow more input, dialoged and dis-
cussion of these important issues from all in-
volved stakeholders. 
We appreciate your consideration of our 
views and please do not hesitate to reach out 
if NSSGA may be of any assistance.

FEBRUARY 25, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
nearly six million Farm Bureau member 
families across the United States, we write 
in strong opposition to H.R. 803, the Pro-
tecting America’s Wilderness and Public 
Lands Act. Collectively this package of bills 
impacts lands in California, Colorado, Ari-
zona and Washington by creating nearly 1.5 
million acres of new wilderness, the most re-
strictive federal land use classification. Ad-
ditionally, it would designate 1,200 miles of 
wild and scenic rivers and create 110,000 
acres of National Monument expansion. Fur-
ther, many of the wilderness and wild and 
scenic river designations contained in this 
bill are not suitable for these restrictive des-
ignations. To declare areas that do not pos-
sess these characteristics undermines the in-
tegrity of the Wilderness Act and the Wild 
and Scenic Rivers Act as well as the lands 
that possess those features. 
Farmers and ranchers rely on federal for-
ests and rangelands for economic and rec-
reational opportunities. Livestock grazing 
on federal lands forms an integral part of 
ranching 
operations 
across 
the 
United 
States, especially in the West. But farmers 
also use national forests and rangelands 
throughout the United States in a variety of 
other ways. Federal lands throughout the 
country are important components of our 
nation’s watersheds that provide water to a 
large number of Americans. Active land 
management practices such as timber pro-
duction and livestock grazing are critical to 
protect against wildland fires which dev-
astate range resources, damage watersheds, 
threaten wildlife and put rural communities 
at great risk. 
American farmers and ranchers have a gen-
uine interest in healthy and productive fed-
eral forest and rangelands. At the same time, 
we have a genuine interest in seeing lands 
managed in an environmentally sound man-
ner. Farmers and ranchers understand and 
appreciate that active management of our 
federal lands is critical to the long-term via-
bility of the ecosystem, the resource, and the 
communities they support. Designations in-
cluded in H.R. 803 threaten multiple use 
areas by prohibiting the employment of mo-
torized tools and mechanized vehicles in wa-
tershed management, trail maintenance, soil 
treatment, noxious weed control, waste man-
agement and fire protection. 
Our nation’s federal forests are facing seri-
ous threats from fires, insects and disease 
due to a lack of active forest management. 
The poor health of our federal forests also 
threatens wildlife populations and neigh-
boring non-federal lands, as well as the vital-
ity of rural, forested communities across the 
country. A vibrant livestock and forest prod-
ucts industry helps diversify rural economies 
in ways that compliment ranching and agri-
cultural operations. Wilderness and National 
Monument designations eliminate federal 
land management agencies ability to effec-
tively protect against the threat of cata-
strophic wildland fire. 
Farmers, 
landowners, 
and 
grazing 
permitees should be fully involved as af-
fected partners in any process to execute fed-
eral land use designations which restrict 
public use and access. Federal land use des-
ignations that lack local stakeholder input 
from agricultural and resource management 
professionals often generates significant con-
troversy and economic hardship at the local 
level. The detrimental effects of a federal 
land use designation frequently causes resi-
dents, elected state and county officials, and 
local stakeholders significant reductions in 
economic activity and the loss of jobs in 
rural communities. Past designations have 
also affected water rights, public lands graz-
ing and access to State and private lands. 
Farm Bureau supports the multiple-use 
concept of federal lands, recognizing that de-
finable land areas have dominant-use capa-
bility, which should be recognized with the 
concept of multiple uses without the total 
exclusion of other uses. The Protecting 
America’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act 
stands in clear violation of AFBF policy. Ad-
ditionally, the California, Colorado, Arizona 
and Washington Farm Bureau’s oppose pas-
sage of this legislation. 
Farm Bureau urges you to oppose passage 
of H.R. 803, the Protecting America’s Wilder-
ness and Public Lands Act. 
Sincerely, 
American Farm Bureau Federation, Ari-
zona Farm Bureau, California Farm Bureau, 
Colorado Farm Bureau, Washington Farm 
Bureau. 
RAU´ L GRIJALVA, 
Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
BRUCE WESTERMAN, 
Ranking Member, House Natural Resources 
Committee, Washington, DC. 
CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA AND RANKING MEMBER 
WESTERMAN: 
The National Cattlemen’s Beef Associa-
tion, the American Sheep Industry Associa-
tion and the Public Lands Council are deeply 
concerned about the potential immediate 
and long-term impacts of H.R. 803, the Colo-
rado Wilderness Act. NCBA is the nation’s 
largest and oldest trade association rep-
resenting America’s cattle producers, with 
other 250,000 producers represented directly 
and through its 46 state affiliate associa-
tions. Since 1865, ASI has been the national 
trade organization representing the interests 
of more than 100,000 sheep producers located 
throughout the country who produce Amer-
ica’s lamb and wool. The Public Lands is the 
only national organization dedicated solely 
to representing the roughly 22,000 ranchers 
who hold federal grazing permits and operate 
on federal lands. H.R. 803 ’s passage would be 
detrimental to public lands ranchers who 
utilize federal grazing permits. 
While this bill obviously seeks to appeal to 
the desire to protect a landscape’s natural 
state, the impact of designating lands as wil-
derness, especially such vast swaths, signifi-
cantly compromises long-term ecological 
health. Currently, federal lands managed for 
multiple use provide valuable opportunity 
for livestock grazing, which is a tool to man-
age fuels that contribute to the risk of cata-
strophic wildfire. Further, grazing helps to 
cultivate landscapes that are more suitable 
and healthier wildlife habitat. The objectives 
the sponsors profess that they seek to 
achieve are immediately undermined by des-
ignating these millions of acres of wilder-
ness. Designations limit management op-
tions, making it more difficult for land man-
agers and stewards to protect these land-
scapes and their valuable attributes. 
Like ‘‘wilderness,’’ ‘‘preservation’’ is often 
a term used to convey the prioritization of 
maintaining an area’s natural state, regard-
less of impact. While preservation may seem 
optimal, federal lands provide significantly 
greater benefit to all who utilize it when the 
conservation of resources is prioritized. 
While preservation seeks protection of na-
ture from any use or change, conservation 
seeks the proper use of nature, providing op-
portunity for ecological enhancement. Graz-
ing, for example, is a vital conservation tool 
to curb invasive species growth, promote im-
proved soil and forage health, and reduce 
wildfire fuel load. 
Beyond general concerns about promoting 
wilderness designations as a land manage-
ment tool, H.R. 803 fails to follow established 
criteria for ‘‘wilderness,’’ instead arbitrarily 
designating areas as ‘‘wilderness’’ and ‘‘wild 
and scenic rivers’’ despite official testimony 
from relevant land management agencies. At 
a minimum, wilderness determinations must 
be grounded in science and fact. 
As Congress continues to develop natural 
resources and federal lands policy, it must 
prioritize legislation that recognizes that 
conservation, not preservation, is the key to 
effective land management and continued 
enjoyment for future generations. We urge 
you to oppose H.R. 803, the Colorado Wilder-
ness Act, and seek more engaged, thoughtful 
management of our precious natural re-
sources. 
Sincerely, 
American Sheep Industry Association, 
National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, 
Public Lands Council. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this 
package is a massive land-removal bill. 
It basically takes 2.7 million acres 
away from meaningful production. 
The one good thing I can say is, it is 
consistent with this majority and this 
administration’s actions that make us 
more reliant on China and will enrich 
China. That is the one good thing; it is 
at least consistent. 
Now, the majority feels that people 
in this town know better than the peo-
ple who are losing this land for the dif-
ferent uses for which they could have 
it. I know we are hearing today on the 
floor: Oh, we have all these people who 
want this bill passed. 
It should have gone through com-
mittee so we could do the motions, we 
could have witnesses, and we could find 
out for ourselves. After 3 years of the 
Russia hoax, we really need to hear 
from the sources. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia 
(Mr. 
HUFFMAN), 
the 
distin-
guished chairman of the Water, Oceans, 
and Wildlife Subcommittee.

great legislation, and I am grateful

February 25, 2021 
Northwest 
California 
Wilderness, 
Recreation, and Working Forests Act. 
This bill addresses some lands in my 
district that are some of the most bio-
diverse ecosystems and exciting out-
door recreation opportunities you will 
find anywhere in California. These 
areas are home to old-growth trees 
critical for carbon sequestration, rivers 
that provide fish habitat and unparal-
leled recreation, and mountain trails 
that offer hiking, biking, and other 
unique experiences. 
Being active in the outdoors and ex-
periencing wild places is a way of life 
in my district. Over the past year, with 
lockdowns and isolation, we have seen 
how important getting outside has 
been for our well-being. We all depend 
on the ecological, economic, and men-
tal health benefits that our public 
lands provide, and that is why my leg-
islation takes a multifaceted approach 
to public land management. 
First, it includes an ambitious res-
toration plan to improve forest health, 
promote fire resilience, and protect 
communities. 
Second, it recognizes the importance 
of the outdoor recreation economy by 
increasing recreational opportunities 
and tourism. Investing in our public 
lands means we are also investing in 
communities near our public lands, and 
that is why there is so much broad sup-
port in my district for this bill. 
Then, finally, this legislation pro-
tects important wild places. These 
areas include critical habitat and eco-
systems as well as some of the best 
fishing, hiking, and white water runs 
in the State. It takes conservation se-
riously because it is urgently needed 
for the future of our planet. 
I would also like to explain the proc-
ess. I believe good process leads to good 
policy, and we have worked very hard 
on this bill, starting when I first got to 
Congress. We have asked stakeholders 
about policy issues that should be ad-
dressed in public lands legislation. The 
legislation was further refined over 
more than 5 years of work. I have re-
peatedly sat down with constituents at 
public meetings and otherwise. We 
have discussed all the concerns that 
were addressed by local officials. 
I believe that this comprehensive, 
carefully developed bill reflects that 
good process in the fact that we have 
such broad support, including con-
servation organizations, outdoor recre-
ation groups, dozens of businesses, 
community 
leaders, 
adjacent 
land-
owners, and former and current elected 
officials from all the affected counties. 
It also drew bipartisan support in the 
Natural Resources Committee, which is 
a rare thing for a wilderness-related 
bill. 
This bill is focused on a future for 
northwest 
California, 
where 
public 
lands are resilient and our outdoor 
recreation economy grows while we 
preserve environmental values for fu-
ture generations. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN). 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I op-
pose this highly partisan and divisive 
legislation. 
In Colorado alone, this bill puts 
700,000 acres into the most restrictive 
land use category of all—wilderness. I 
know the intent of the sponsors is to 
protect the land, but in practice, the 
use of land under wilderness designa-
tion is so restrictive, hardly anyone 
can use it. 
Do you dream of taking your kids or 
grandkids for a bike ride on wilderness 
land someday? Forget about it. Bicy-
cles are prohibited by BLM in wilder-
ness land as well as motorized vehicles, 
roads, wheelbarrows, and carts. The 
land is locked away from future gen-
erations. 
I prefer public lands with many uses, 
and that is where this bill fails our 
children. You can’t even take a baby 
onto wilderness land in a stroller. 
Do you care about the health of our 
forests? Then don’t vote for this bill. 
The most basic types of preventive 
maintenance are illegal under wilder-
ness designation. You can’t take a 
chain saw and cut away fire traps, and 
you can’t trim branches or overgrown 
timber stands and underbrush. 
Colorado has had too many forest 
fires, and with beetle kill, parts of Col-
orado are a tinderbox. Should this be-
come law, with its restrictions on fire 
prevention, we are going to see bigger 
and hotter fires in Colorado than ever 
before. I don’t want to see Colorado 
burn up. That is why I am voting ‘‘no’’ 
on this bill. 
Many county commissioners, indi-
vidual citizens, and even the U.S. Rep-
resentative for western Colorado op-
pose this bill. Like me, they don’t want 
to see the public lose access to wilder-
ness areas, and they don’t want to see 
our forests go up in flames. Vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this bill.

Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I was born and raised on 
the Olympic Peninsula of Washington 
State, and I know firsthand how spe-
cial our region is and how our public 
lands contribute to the fabric of who 
we are. 
In our region, we understand that 
protecting our public lands isn’t just 
about saving these unforgettable places 
for future generations. It also means 
protecting high-quality jobs for the 
next generation as well. 
That is important to me, as someone 
who grew up on the peninsula and as 
someone who worked in economic de-
velopment professionally for over a 
decade. 
I have seen how our natural re-
sources contribute to our economic vi-
tality. Each year, millions of people 
and families travel to our State and 
contribute roughly $22 billion in eco-
nomic impact and support 200,000 jobs 
in Washington’s outdoor economy. 
Our national treasures have helped 
create opportunities for local entre-
preneurs who started restaurants, guid-
ed tour companies, hotels, and B&Bs, 
and other small businesses. That is 
why it makes sense to protect these 
special places, and that is why I am 
proud that the House is considering 
this comprehensive package, including 
a bill I introduced called the Wild 
Olympics Wilderness and Wild and Sce-
nic Rivers Act. 
That bill protects some of our most 
environmentally sensitive areas by es-
tablishing a new wilderness area to 
protect the last remaining old-growth 
stands on the peninsula and desig-
nating 19 rivers and tributaries as wild 
and scenic rivers to protect critical 
salmon spawning habitats. 
This proposal has evolved through 
extensive 
public 
engagement 
with 
Tribes, conservation groups, timber 
communities, business leaders, shell-
fish growers, and everybody in-be-
tween, to create a bill that works for 
our local communities. 
It is because of that outreach that 
this bill is now formally supported by 
more than 800 community leaders, Re-
publicans 
and 
Democrats, 
businessowners, 
sportsmen, 
mayors, 
county commissioners, and Tribal lead-
ers, all of whom agree this proposal 
moves our region in the right direc-
tion. 
In addition to protecting recreational 
access and supporting our outdoor 
economy, the bill bolsters our region’s 
efforts to protect sources of clean 
drinking 
water, 
supporting 
critical 
salmon and steelhead habitats, and 
protecting key waterways that are 
vital to our shellfish industry. 
But just as important are all the 
things this bill will not do. This pro-
posal will not close, decommission, or 
otherwise restrict access to any Forest 
Service roads or trailheads. It will not 
impact any harvestable timber base in 
the Olympic National Forest. I am 
doing a whole bunch of other work to 
increase the harvest through other ave-
nues. 
This bill will not affect any private 
property rights. It will not impact how 
the Washington Department of Natural 
Resources manages State-owned lands, 
which is why it has gained support of 
the Washington commissioner of public 
lands. 
We know that our region’s future de-
pends on building a strong and diversi-
fied economy, and after years of col-
laboration, I think this bill we are con-
sidering today represents a clear win- 
win for the communities I represent. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
senior Senator from Washington, Sen-
ator MURRAY, for her partnership in 
this effort. I want to thank the lead 
sponsor and the Natural Resources 
Committee. I encourage my colleagues 
to vote in favor of this legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, ev-
erything we touch in our daily lives,

H698 
February 25, 2021 
everything that makes our existence 
possible, everything that makes us 
more comfortable and more prosperous, 
everything we see in this Chamber 
comes to us in only two ways. It is ei-
ther grown or it is mined. That is a 
universal truth. 
Everything we enjoy on this planet is 
either grown or mined. Fortunately, 
nature has given us a super abundance 
of resources and left it to us to respon-
sibly reap and to manage this bounty. 
But it is precisely these resources 
that the left has waged war against for 
an entire generation. The very things 
that make us prosperous and com-
fortable are the things the left at-
tempts to place off limits. 
Is it any wonder that the more they 
extend their domain, the worse the 
human conditions that they produce? 
This bill declares another 1.5 million 
acres of public lands, mostly forests, an 
area about the size of Delaware, a wil-
derness area, off limits to forest man-
agement, timber harvesting, and even 
many forms of public recreation. An 
untended forest is like an untended 
garden. It will grow until it chokes 
itself to death and succumbs to disease, 
pestilence, 
and, 
ultimately, 
cata-
strophic wildfire. 
These restrictions have abandoned 
our forests to neglect and produced the 
paradox of a severe national lumber 
shortage while the government sits on 
vast timber reserves. 
This bill places 1,200 more miles of 
rivers under similar restrictions that 
create water shortages in some of the 
most water-abundant regions of our 
country. 
It prevents mineral extraction and 
energy production from another 1.2 
million acres, killing jobs, crushing the 
economy, and empowering our inter-
national adversaries. At a time when 
the Federal Government’s bad manage-
ment practices have created a $12 bil-
lion maintenance backlog, this bill 
takes another half million acres of land 
into Federal mismanagement. 
Understand what that means to local 
communities. This is land that is pro-
ducing no taxes and little commerce. 
Much is being seized over local objec-
tions in States where the Federal Gov-
ernment already controls more than 
half of their entire land area. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a direct attack 
on working Americans who depend on 
the resources of our Nation to put food 
on their tables and a roof over their 
heads. It is an attack on the prosperity 
and security of our people, and it is 
what we have come to expect from the 
greens gone wild on the other side of 
the aisle. 
The result will be more dead forests, 
more water shortages, increasing costs 
for energy and consumer goods, lower 
wages, and fewer jobs. 
These policies always produce want 
from plenty, and I am afraid they will 
continue until the American people fi-
nally demand that we restore the na-
tion of abundance that we once took 
for granted. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CARBAJAL). 
Mr. 
CARBAJAL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to rep-
resent the central coast of California, 
one of the most beautiful districts in 
the Nation, if not the most beautiful. 
Places like Los Padres National Forest 
and the Carrizo Plain National Monu-
ment contain some of the most stun-
ning and diverse ecosystems found any-
where in North America. 
Today, I am pleased to support H.R. 
803, the Protecting America’s Wilder-
ness and Public Lands Act. This bill 
would preserve the natural beauty and 
recreational 
activities 
available 
to 
communities in my district and be-
yond. 
This measure includes my legisla-
tion, H.R. 973, the Central Coast Herit-
age Protection Act. I am proud to have 
worked with Chairman GRIJALVA, Rep-
resentative BROWNLEY, Representative 
PANETTA, and local stakeholders to en-
sure that California’s central coast was 
included in this bill. 
In particular, I want to thank the 
Carrizo Plain Conservancy, Los Padres 
Forest Watch, Condor Trail Associa-
tion, CalWild, Pew Charitable Trusts, 
and the Sierra Club for their support 
and advocacy on behalf of our public 
lands. 
Title IV of this environmental pack-
age would designate nearly 250,000 
acres of public land within the Los Pa-
dres National Forest and the Carrizo 
Plain National Monument as wilder-
ness areas, the highest form of Federal 
protection available. It also creates a 
400-mile Condor National Scenic Trail 
stretching from Los Angeles to Mon-
terey County. 
This bill is the culmination of years 
of 
collaboration 
with 
local 
stake-
holders and community members. It 
has garnered support from nearly 500 
central coast landowners, businesses, 
farmers, and local officials; a testa-
ment that protecting our environment 
and growing our economy are not mu-
tually exclusive. In fact, they go hand 
in hand. 
In California alone, the outdoor 
recreation economy is worth $92 billion 
and employs over 650,000 people. Jobs 
in manufacturing, retail, and tourism 
rely on access to the great outdoors. 
Climate change poses a serious threat 
to this sector of our economy and com-
munities like mine will bear the brunt 
of this crisis. 
Nearly 25 percent of greenhouse gas 
emissions come from oil drilling. That 
is one reason I am glad the Biden ad-
ministration has set an ambitious goal 
to protect 30 percent of our public 
lands by 2030. This bill will help us get 
there. 
Our public lands are an essential 
asset to our environment and tourism 
economy. Passing this bill means we 
can protect both for generations to 
come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the gen-
tleman from Arkansas for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, we have listened to our 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
talk about their desire for protecting 
wilderness areas and our natural re-
sources, and I want to commend them 
for that. I agree with them, we need to 
do a better job doing that. 
As we have had an opportunity to 
talk in the past, Mr. Speaker, in a pre-
vious life I taught mountaineering 
courses, I led climbing trips, I led 
mountain biking trips, kayaking, and 
was a river guide. I spent more time 
out in these very areas that they are 
talking about than every single one of 
them sitting there combined. It is what 
I did. It is how I lived for years. 
And, Mr. Speaker, listening to this 
talk, I see an extraordinary disconnect, 
and let me be very clear. I have heard 
people saying that this is going to pro-
mote economic development and pro-
mote recreational opportunity. Mr. 
Speaker, that is not true. It is not fact. 
As a matter of fact, what happens 
under this legislation in these designa-
tions is that those very recreational 
opportunities that create economic ac-
tivity are actually eliminated. They 
are prohibited under this act. 
You cannot do things like mountain 
biking. I will say, they finally came 
back and made some adjustments on 
wilderness areas where you can leave 
descending 
devices—thank 
you—but 
you can’t do these things. 
So how in the world are you going to 
make more money and have more eco-
nomic activity? 
Are they going to offer unicorn rides? 
You can’t do that. This doesn’t work. 
It doesn’t make sense. We are not fol-
lowing the regular process you do to 
evaluate wilderness areas. 
What happened last Congress—we 
have a new Member of Congress who 
represents three-quarters of this area 
and she wasn’t given an opportunity to 
be consulted. Amendments to allow 
local governments and maybe the citi-
zens were rejected. Let them make a 
decision here. 
Mr. Speaker, why were those ideas 
rejected? 
I had an amendment that simply said 
that we should allow best practices in 
wildfire management. That was prohib-
ited. We have had seven million acres 
of this very area burned and we are 
prohibiting the best practices in wild-
fire management. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to know what 
they are going to tell their constitu-
ents and other people’s constituents 
when these areas burn because of their 
irresponsible activities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this 
legislation. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, with 
much respect to my colleague from

Louisiana—and I enjoy working with 
him—I just want to assure him, be-
cause he spent a great deal of time in 
Colorado, that he is still going to be 
able to enjoy the wonderful outdoor 
recreation that our State has under 
this bill. 
If anything, his ability to do so will 
only increase. And that is why the 
American Whitewater Association, the 
American Canoe Association, the Inter-
national Mountain Bicycling Associa-
tion, The American Alpine Club, and 
Backcountry Hunters & Anglers all 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 803, the Pro-
tecting America’s Wilderness and Pub-
lic Lands Act. 
This legislation includes the text of 
my bill, H.R. 693, the San Gabriel 
Mountains Foothills and Rivers Pro-
tection Act, which is the result of dec-
ades of grassroots advocacy and com-
munity engagement to improve protec-
tions and access for these treasured 
lands of southern California. 
The San Gabriel Mountains provide 
30 percent of the Los Angeles area 
water, comprise 70 percent of the coun-
ty’s open space, and are home to his-
toric habitats of species like the Cali-
fornia condor and Nelson’s bighorn 
sheep. 
This immense natural beauty exists 
right in the backyard of one of the 
densest urban areas of our country, of-
fering recreation opportunities like 
hiking, fishing, and camping to the 
more than 15 million Americans that 
live nearby. That is so important be-
cause the Los Angeles region is among 
the most park-poor areas in the coun-
try, which means that too many com-
munities are deprived of the well-docu-
mented public and mental health bene-
fits that result from access to outdoor 
recreation opportunities in their own 
neighborhood. 
After President Obama granted my 
request to designate the San Gabriel 
Mountains a national monument in 
2014, we immediately began to see 
cleaner rivers; improved facilities, like 
picnic areas; safer hiking trails; and 
more rangers to interact with visitors. 
Most importantly, it brought the en-
tire community together to develop a 
management plan for the monument 
with over 40 Members representing a 
variety of stakeholders, such as water 
agencies, local governments, the busi-
ness community, and environmental 
advocates. 
b 1800 
That is why this same level of protec-
tion is needed throughout the moun-
tains and in the communities that 
serve as their gateway. 
This legislation would make that a 
reality by expanding the Monument’s 
boundaries to include the western An-
geles National Forest, establishing new 
and expanded wilderness areas, and 
protecting more than 45 miles of wild 
and scenic rivers. It would also estab-
lish the new San Gabriel Mountains 
National Recreation area to bolster the 
connection between urban and wild 
spaces. 
Mr. Speaker, for nearly two decades, 
so many stakeholders have worked to-
gether with a common vision of a com-
munity seamlessly connected to the 
beautiful wild lands in its backyard. 
Today, we have an opportunity to real-
ize that vision. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE), the 
chair of the Western Caucus. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Arkansas 
(Mr. WESTERMAN). 
Mr. Speaker, this morning, I joined 
my Congressional Western Caucus col-
leagues, Representatives CHRIS STEW-
ART and YVETTE HERRELL, to hear from 
community leaders in their States 
about the severe funding shortfalls 
they are now facing due to President 
Biden’s moratorium on oil and gas 
leases on Federal lands. 
We heard from county commissioners 
and education officials, including one 
who 
shared—in 
tears—the 
heart-
breaking stories of students experi-
encing mental health challenges, who 
have attempted suicide due to the chal-
lenges facing our Nation’s students. 
The last thing these communities need 
is to face budgetary deficiencies that 
threaten the support systems within 
our public schools. Yet, this legislation 
before us will contribute to those very 
budget shortfalls. 
By further preventing responsible en-
ergy and resource production on Fed-
eral lands, we are harming our Nation’s 
energy industry, but we are also harm-
ing our workers by destroying their 
jobs. We are harming our students by 
cutting their public school funding. We 
are harming our communities by slash-
ing their State and local budget. 
Mr. Speaker, you see, we are siloing 
off the effects of the pandemic from the 
actions and consequences of the Fed-
eral government regulatory mandates. 
The combinations of COVID–19, the 
Biden ban on Federal leasing, and now 
this massive land-grab legislation is 
simply going to devastate rural com-
munities in the West. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
these 
consequences 
don’t take place in a silo. They take a 
toll. 
I can list many other concerning con-
sequences—from harming our energy 
independence, restricting public access 
to our public lands, to increasing the 
poor health of our Nation’s forest. But 
more than anything, I hope my col-
leagues will pause to think of the 
human impacts these actions will have 
on our neighbors, our fellow Ameri-
cans, and the toll it will take after one 
of the most challenging years in our 
lifetimes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this legislation. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF), 
the chairman. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Protecting Amer-
ica’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act. 
Those unfamiliar with Los Angeles 
may think it is a series of communities 
interconnected only by freeways. But 
in fact, the opposite is true. It is con-
nected by the wildlife and open spaces 
that bridge our communities and bring 
us together. 
Mr. Speaker, for nearly 20 years, I 
have worked with my constituents to 
expand, preserve, and protect the space 
that surrounds the L.A. Basin, known 
as the Rim of the Valley. My legisla-
tion, which is included in H.R. 803, is 
the Rim of the Valley Corridor Preser-
vation Act, and it would expand the 
Santa 
Monica 
Mountains 
National 
Recreation area to include these pris-
tine lands. The legislation will protect 
almost 200,000 acres of open space for 
generations to come. 
Los Angeles is one of the most park- 
poor regions in the country. And dur-
ing the pandemic, while many of us are 
stuck in our homes, it has caused us to 
reevaluate our priorities and consider 
what matters most. 
For me and many Angelenos, it has 
been spending time with family and 
getting outdoors—hikes through Grif-
fith Park, runs through the Verdugos, 
or walks in the Arroyo. Trails are full 
on weekends, and that won’t change 
after the pandemic ends. 
By expanding the national recreation 
area, the National Park Service will 
have the authority to make capital im-
provements, 
like 
repairing 
hiking 
trails and maintaining facilities for 
public enjoyment, studying wildlife 
and its habitats, and participating in 
cooperative conservation with local 
landowners. It will help ensure that 
wildlife 
corridors 
that 
allow 
Los 
Angelenos to witness mountain lions, 
like P–22 and P–96, black bears we have 
come to know, like Meatball, and other 
precious wildlife are still present in 
our own backyards. 
This package of bills will also sup-
port the Biden administration’s com-
mitment to conserving public lands 
and waters, as well as protecting com-
munities from the effects of climate 
change. 
Like the last Congress, it is my hope 
that the House can pass this bill with 
bipartisan support, and we will finally 
see this legislation through to the fin-
ish line. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we 
have a willing partner with President 
Biden, who strongly supports H.R. 803. 
I thank Chairman GRIJALVA, Rep-
resentative DEGETTE, and my other 
colleagues who have bills in this pack-
age, for all the work they did on this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 803.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H700 
February 25, 2021 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER), the ranking 
member on the Subcommittee on En-
ergy and Mineral Resources. 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to H.R. 803, 
a package of Democrat land-grab bills 
that were not marked up in the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources and are 
opposed by several members and the 
constituents they serve. 
H.R. 803 is a 330-page partisan pack-
age containing 8 different bills. Not one 
bill or one page was marked up or 
heard in committee this Congress. Un-
fortunately, Democrats on the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources have 
waived responsibility. There have been 
zero markups or committee hearings 
this Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, we have 8 new Repub-
lican members on our committee, and 3 
on the Subcommittee on Energy and 
Mineral Resources alone, a committee 
which I lead. Our membership deserves 
to debate these bills and mark them 
up. Let’s have our new members hear 
from the stakeholders and make deci-
sions based on the evidence presented. 
We need to end this practice of just 
giving away committee jurisdiction 
and jamming through legislation. 
H.R. 803 dovetails with the Biden/ 
Harris agenda and puts America last by 
outsourcing our supply of critical min-
erals and endangering our national se-
curity. Our submarines and aircraft 
carriers are powered with clean nuclear 
energy. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARSON). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, nuclear 
power is a huge contributor to our elec-
tric grid. By withdrawing areas from 
uranium and other mineral develop-
ment, it furthers our reliance on 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia— 
who I assure you, do not have the labor 
or environmental standards that we de-
mand in our country and who do not 
have our best interests at heart. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time each side has re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado has 6 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Arkan-
sas has 15 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Arkansas. I appre-
ciate the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to H.R. 803. 
In my Northern California district, 
we are devastated year after year after 
year, as we are all over the West by 
wildfire and unmanaged forests. Adding 
1.5 million more acres of untouchable 
lands because of wilderness designation 
does not help. It will merely make the 
problem worse. 
What is the purpose of a new wilder-
ness designation? What does it achieve? 
It isn’t needed to prevent a new high-
way or a new mine, oil and gas oper-
ations, or a new dam. Those are al-
ready difficult things to get permitted, 
taking years and years. 
So why do we have to have this des-
ignation? We are already so far behind 
on forest management that I don’t 
know when we will ever get out of it, 
because every year—every year—we 
have devastating fires affecting our 
public lands, the access to those lands, 
the private lands that are near them, 
and the towns of the people that live 
nearby them as well. 
The economy has already been dev-
astated in those areas because of regu-
latory ideas that come out of Wash-
ington, D.C., and California to stop the 
type of work that needs to be done for 
those logging communities. 
Mr. Speaker, this is wrongheaded leg-
islation and is unnecessary. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
O’HALLERAN). 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Colorado for 
yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in 
favor of H.R. 803, an important package 
of public interest land protections. 
Within this comprehensive legisla-
tion is the Grand Canyon Protection 
Act. Tomorrow, the Grand Canyon 
celebrates 102 years as a National 
Park, making a century of welcoming 
visitors from all over the country and 
the world, to this First District and to 
America. It is recognized as one of the 
world’s greatest natural wonders. 
There is no doubt that this is a spe-
cial, sacred place that must be pro-
tected. That is why my colleagues and 
I introduced the Grand Canyon Protec-
tion Act, commonsense legislation, 
that would permanently ban uranium 
mining around the Grand Canyon. 
It was stated no one is mining near 
the Grand Canyon. There is a mine six 
miles right outside the South Gate. 
Somebody stated that there is noth-
ing nearby that would impact the 
Grand Canyon. There are 500-plus aban-
doned uranium mines just outside the 
Navajo Nation, and just outside the 
East Gate of the Grand Canyon, and 
numerous streams and creeks and 
washes run from the east land into the 
Grand Canyon. 
The Grand Canyon is the base of a $1 
billion-a-year tourism industry for the 
Northern Arizona region. 
Rural 
and 
Tribal 
communities 
throughout Northern Arizona are still 
grappling with the toxic waste that has 
been there for over almost—I should 
say, 80 years—80 years it has been there 
and caused health problems. Too many 
Tribal families in our district continue 
to fight the cancers and the disease 
caused by radiation exposures over 
those decades. 
Expanding uranium mining in the 
area would not only aggravate these 
serious health conditions and risks, but 
also make the Colorado rivers suscep-
tible to uranium mining pollution. Cur-
rently, the river and nearby aquifers 
are the main water source for over 12 
million people in the Colorado River 
Basin. 
Above all else, the Grand Canyon is a 
place of deep spiritual significance to 
many 
Native 
communities 
in 
the 
southwest, a home to the Havasupai 
Tribe. We must protect these lands for 
those who know them as sacred. 
Also, in today’s package, are meas-
ures I have championed, including the 
Casa Grande Ruins National Monument 
Boundary Modification and the Sunset 
Crater Volcano National Monument 
Boundary Adjustment. 
In a typical year, the Casa Grande 
Ruins attracts tens of thousands of 
visitors; but more importantly, it also 
is a sacred place and the past home of 
the 
Hohokam 
irrigation 
projects 
throughout the southern part of Ari-
zona. 
This boundary modification will also 
ensure that the San Carlos Irrigation 
Project has access to critical irrigation 
infrastructure. 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
once said, ‘‘There is nothing so Amer-
ican as our national parks. The funda-
mental idea behind the parks is that 
the country belongs to the people, that 
it is in the process of making for the 
enrichment of the lives of all of us.’’ 
I don’t understand how we could 
stand here and say that we should not 
protect one of the greatest national 
wonders of the world. 
Over the course of this pandemic, we 
have seen just how vital our treasured 
public lands and outdoor spaces have 
become for families across this coun-
try. An opportunity to get outside and 
celebrate what it is to be an American. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to express my concern with 
this lands package. 
I was elected just this past Novem-
ber, with many of my freshmen col-
leagues, and I am sincere in my com-
mitment to work with my Democratic 
colleagues on the Committee on Nat-
ural Resources. However, the majority 
is pushing legislation with significant 
environmental and economic costs for 
the American people without a markup 
or hearing. 
The work that was done in the 116th 
Congress or before is great. We are in 
the 117th Congress now, and I sincerely 
would like to have had that oppor-
tunity. I was excited to be able to put 
forth some amendments to this. 
This package disregards input from 
local and State officials, puts our lands 
at greater risk for wildfires, and 
threatens livelihoods for those who 
work in extractive industries at a time 
when our country is financially hurt-
ing from the pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H701 
February 25, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, this style of policy-
making is unsustainable, and it has 
major ramifications for Utahns. The 
policies that result from H.R. 803 will 
impact jobs and recreation and restrict 
local input over our lands. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I op-
pose H.R. 803. But I stand here hopeful 
that we can come together and find 
common ground. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to this partisan wil-
derness package before us today. 
This bill is yet another example of 
the majority taking steps to prevent 
the creation of high-wage jobs and ac-
cess to our public lands all while 
ceding our energy independence to for-
eign adversaries. 
This bill also contains provisions af-
fecting Members’ districts without the 
support of those Members. These in-
clude the permanent ban on mineral 
development on over 1 million acres of 
public lands in Mr. GOSAR’s district in 
Northern 
Arizona, 
something 
he 
strongly opposes. 
Also included, are countless new land 
designations in Mrs. BOEBERT’s and Mr. 
LAMBORN’s 
districts 
in 
Colorado— 
again, without their support. 
The delays in permitting, coupled 
with the mismanagement of our Nat-
ural Resources, our forests, and hand-
ing this all over to the Federal Govern-
ment for management, is a mistake. 
We need more cooperation with the 
management of public lands with the 
States and those that live on, in, or 
around or make their living from these 
lands, Mr. Speaker. 
b 1815 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Idaho 
(Mr. 
FULCHER), 
the 
ranking 
member on the Public Lands Sub-
committee. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman WESTERMAN for yielding 
me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, as has been mentioned, 
this bill would add 1.5 million new 
acres of wilderness area, monument ex-
pansion, and scenic rivers. That sounds 
pretty good. Now, here is the rest of 
the story, and it is coming from some-
one whose home State is two-thirds 
federally owned. 
This bill also comes with a critical 
mineral ban on things like uranium. 
China and Russia will thank us for 
that. 
This bill also comes with a ban on 
any active land management, which is 
a welcome mat for wildfires. It is sim-
ple. If we don’t manage, a lightning 
strike will. Now, that is too bad for 
wildlife, the environment, and produc-
tive use, but at least we get the privi-
lege of spending taxpayer dollars for 
fire suppression. 
Mr. Speaker, we can’t rationalize the 
contents in this bill to the objective 
American taxpayer, but that is what 
happens when legislation gets rammed 
through without one markup or ade-
quate bipartisan review. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose H.R. 803, the western wildfire 
bill. 
Make no mistake, while some seek 
preservation, what we need is manage-
ment. It always seems like those who 
seek to preserve, they go to the places 
that are most well managed. These 
places now will suffer as a result of 
that. 
But I want to emphasize three things 
that all Americans are going to lose 
with this bill. 
Job security: We have already seen 
11,000 jobs jeopardized by the abroga-
tion of a contract by President Biden 
in regard to the Keystone XL pipeline. 
Economic security: Lumber prices 
continue to rise. Taking timber off the 
marketplace is not going to make the 
cost of building a home any cheaper. 
You want to get kids out of their par-
ents’ basement? You are not going to 
do it this way, by raising the price of 
being able to build a home. 
National security: We have become 
an energy-independent country here 
over the last 10 years, and it has gotten 
us out of the forever wars in the Middle 
East. This jeopardizes those achieve-
ments. 
Job security, economic security, na-
tional security are all at stake here 
with this bill. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT), whose 
district is more affected by this bill 
than anyone else. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. I rise 
today to oppose the latest Democrat 
land grab, in the form of H.R. 803. 
This bill, which is actually eight bills 
piled into one, adds nearly 1.5 million 
acres of new wilderness and perma-
nently withdraws 1.2 million acres 
from mineral production. Seriously? 
This is the approach we are taking? 
Democrats want to stop mineral pro-
duction, lock up our lands, and depend 
on our enemies in Russia, Saudi Ara-
bia, and China for our energy, all while 
pretending to be green. 
It is unacceptable to outsource our 
energy development to countries that 
often use child and slave labor. We lit-
erally have children mining in Congo 
with their bare hands to appease these 
not-in-my-backyard extremists. 
Speaking of backyards, Mr. Speaker, 
the sponsor of title I in this bill doesn’t 
have a single acre designated as new 
wilderness in her district, yet title I 
alone locks up 510,000 acres in my dis-
trict. The Grand Junction Chamber 
sent me a letter opposing this, stating: 
These are lands that are literally in 
our backyard in Mesa County, yet Con-
gresswoman DEGETTE continues to ig-
nore us, does not meet with us, and 
does 
not 
even 
consider 
the 
con-
sequences of her bill on the hard-
working families of our district. 
Could anyone here imagine me legis-
lating away any part of Denver or 
Boulder? The Member who authored 
title I’s attack on my district simply 
responds to doubts and concerns by in-
viting D.C. swampers to my district on 
horseback to look at the pretty views, 
and then they call it a day. 
Dolores County is mentioned several 
times in this massive land grab. The 
locals, elected officials, and experts 
have expressed their disdain for this 
bill repeatedly over the years, with no 
regard from the bill’s sponsors. 
After the past year of statewide 
lockdowns, the last thing communities 
in my district need is further restric-
tions imposed by the Federal Govern-
ment on what they can do on public 
lands. Mr. Speaker, the majority is si-
lencing the people of my district in 
order to ram through a 3 million-acre 
land grab. 
Have supporters of this legislation 
considered the disastrous wildfires that 
will result from the new wilderness 
designation and other land grabs in 
this bill? Wilderness is the most re-
strictive land use designation possible. 
It prevents active management of our 
forests, which is critical for mitigation 
against catastrophic wildfires. If we 
don’t manage our forests, Mother Na-
ture will continue to manage them for 
us. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, there is 
quite a lot to respond to. I will just re-
spond to a couple of quick points. 
Virtually all the BLM wilderness 
land that was referenced with respect 
to title I has been managed as wilder-
ness essentially for the better part of 
the last 40 years. 
With respect to wildfires, I would en-
courage my colleague to read the Wil-
derness Act because section 4(d) of the 
Wilderness Act says: ‘‘Such measures 
may be taken as may be necessary in 
the control of fire, insects, and dis-
eases.’’ That is the law. 
Finally, I have to say, with respect 
to the reference to constituent support, 
with respect to the CORE Act, the bill 
that we introduced as part of this com-
ponent bill, Gunnison County, Pitkin 
County, San Juan County, Ouray Coun-
ty, San Miguel County, Eagle County, 
they all support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my 
colleagues again to follow the lead of 
the folks and the voices at the local 
level who are imploring us to pass this 
bill. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time is left on both 
sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas has 7 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Colo-
rado has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Montana (Mr. ROSENDALE).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H702 
February 25, 2021 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to this bill and 
the precedent it will set for public 
lands, especially in the great State of 
Montana, where we do treasure them. 
In our State, we take a balanced use 
approach, where conservation and pub-
lic access go hand in hand. It is a good 
approach, and it is used in other States 
as well. 
This bill would replace that con-
versation with a mandate coming out 
of Washington that will unilaterally 
lock up an area nearly the size of Cas-
cade County, Montana. This bill would 
completely eliminate recreation, re-
source development, and responsible 
forest management on 1.5 million acres 
for an indefinite period of time. A bot-
tom-up, balanced approach almost al-
ways works better than a top-down, 
command-and-control method that the 
majority is trying to impose on us 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this bill. 
Mr. NEGUSE. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 803. 
This bill, while well intentioned, will 
unfortunately result in over a million 
acres being subjected to less efficient 
forestry management services and less 
fuel reduction. I represent the State of 
California, which, last year, experi-
enced the worst fire season in recorded 
State history. Over 4 million acres of 
State land was burned last year. 
The year before that, we had the de-
structive and catastrophic Camp Fire 
that totally destroyed the town of Par-
adise, almost 100 lives lost, almost 
20,000 structures destroyed. I had the 
unfortunate 
experience 
of 
walking 
through that town and witnessing that 
devastation, and it was catastrophic. 
To my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, I have read the ‘‘Wilderness 
Management Manual,’’ and I direct 
their attention to the BLM manual for 
the management of wilderness areas 
that says that ‘‘fuels reduction is only 
allowed in very rare circumstances.’’ 
This will result in more fire damage 
throughout the Western United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I might con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we adopt the motion 
to recommit, we will instruct the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources to con-
sider our cancel the Biden ban amend-
ment to H.R. 803. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of the amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arkansas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. The amendment 
is simple. It will nullify Executive 
Order No. 14008 and Secretarial Order 
No. 3395 issued during the President’s 
first weeks in office. 
The Biden administration wasted no 
time in imposing their extremist envi-
ronmental agenda. On day one, polit-
ical appointees created a nightmare for 
our energy operators and a never-end-
ing bottleneck for approvals necessary 
to keep our energy economy running. 
Just a few days later, President 
Biden halted all new energy production 
on our Federal lands and waters, jeop-
ardizing the livelihoods of thousands of 
Americans in the middle of a pandemic 
and economic crisis. 
The administration has tried to 
downplay the impact of these actions, 
but we are already feeling the con-
sequences of what I like to call the 
Biden ban. The economic impact of the 
decisions will be far-reaching, impact-
ing thousands of companies, many of 
which are small businesses. Recent 
studies have concluded that a long- 
term ban on onshore leasing would cost 
72,000 jobs annually, and a long-term 
ban on offshore drilling would cost 
145,000 jobs. 
Federal 
energy 
development 
rep-
resents a sizable portion of State budg-
ets. Can we afford to cut off this cru-
cial source of revenue as our commu-
nities are struggling to recover from 
the pandemic? Our schools need fund-
ing to buy PPE that they need to re-
open. Yet, the Biden ban would disrupt 
a critical source of revenue that our K– 
12 schools rely on. 
In addition, these actions will bank-
rupt programs like the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. 
The ramifications of these actions by 
the Biden administration will be dev-
astating to our rural communities. 
Americans who work hard every day to 
keep the lights on and our gas prices 
low deserve better than a pink slip 
from out-of-touch political appointees. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support this amendment, recommit 
H.R. 803 to the Natural Resources Com-
mittee, and put Americans back to 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1830 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, today we heard con-
cerns from our Members, including 
Members most affected by this legisla-
tion. 
Tomorrow, we will debate amend-
ments that include 15 new unrelated 
matters to make the total amount of 
bills in this one bill 23. This will make 
this bill three times worse after we 
consider amendments. 
I believe we have the responsibility 
to leave our environment better than 
we found it. We talk about the econ-
omy so often that many people think 
that we forget about the environment. 
That couldn’t be further from the 
truth, we all breathe the air and drink 
the water. 
H.R. 803 would attempt to preserve 
our resources, locking them up and 
throwing away the key. Congress’ focus 
should be on conservation and con-
serving these resources instead, using 
them in sustainable, responsible ways 
that every American can enjoy. 
Since we weren’t given any oppor-
tunity to debate this bill in committee, 
I would like to remind my colleagues 
that this bill will harm the environ-
ment; it will kill jobs; it will limit ac-
cess to outdoor recreation; it will hurt 
State water rights; it will imperil our 
national security and American energy 
independence; it will impede necessary 
forest management; and make us more 
reliant on hostile foreign nations. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to oppose this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you 
again to Chairman GRIJALVA, and to 
each of my colleagues, Representative 
DEGETTE, Representative SCHIFF, Rep-
resentative HUFFMAN, and all of my fel-
low Members who we heard from today 
who worked so hard on this important 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I have to repeat this be-
cause it is important. Every title of 
this bill was heard in the 116th Con-
gress, I was at those hearings. Every 
title was marked up. I attended those 
mark-ups with the ranking member. 
Every single title of this bill passed in 
committee, passed on the floor twice, 
many of them in bipartisan fashion. 
I agree with the ranking member. At 
the end of the day we have an obliga-
tion to leave our environment better 
than when we found it. That is what 
this bill is all about. Protecting the 
most iconic and beautiful places in the 
United States of America so that my 
children, your children, Mr. Speaker, 
and the ranking member’s children can 
continue to enjoy these incredible 
places in our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that my col-
leagues will vote ‘‘yes’’ on this impor-
tant legislation and join us in this ef-
fort. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN). All time for debate has ex-
pired. 
Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, 
further consideration of H.R. 803 is 
postponed.

SLOWDOWNS IN THE U.S. MAIL 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
CASTEN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
for 
months I had calls coming into my of-
fice about delays in the U.S. mail. 
Some of these delays had to do with 
cold weather, some are because of 
COVID, but most are the direct result

of the failures and slowdowns delib-
erately imposed by Postmaster DeJoy. 
His efforts to eliminate overtime, close 
mail processing facilities, and remove 
mail sorting machines have taken all 
of the cushion out of the system. 
Our postal workers are demoralized, 
they are seeing mail pile up as they are 
blamed for the delays. Seniors have 
gone for days waiting for medications. 
Constituents and local mayors are 
sounding the alarm. 
The truth is that our Postal Service 
has survived this assault from its own 
leadership, only because those letter 
carriers and mail handlers have dou-
bled down in spite of the challenges 
through rain, through sleet, and snow. 
And, yet, DeJoy has failed them. He 
has failed the American people. 
He has not failed by accident. He has 
a mission to weaken and ultimately 
privatize the post office to make people 
who depend on the Postal Service 
angry enough to finish the destruction 
that he has started. He hasn’t suc-
ceeded yet. But every day he stays in 
office is another day closer to him real-
izing that goal. The Postal Service 
needs a leader who is committed to 
public service. DeJoy must go.

CELEBRATING VERLINN SANDRA 
AVERY 
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate a pillar of the Vic-
toria, Texas, community, Mrs. Verlinn 
Sandra Avery, who passed away on 
January 30, 2021. 
Resilient and devoted to caring for 
others, Mrs. Avery demonstrated her 
passion for serving her community 
through her work as a child nutrition 
specialist for Victoria ISD, and her 
leadership of Victoria’s Old Landmark 
Committee, which she founded. 
She organized Juneteenth celebra-
tions, multicultural ‘‘Taste of Soul’’ 
events, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
festivities, and much more. 
The impact she had on her commu-
nity is evident in the Victoria news-
papers, which were often filled with 
coverage of her events and letters to 
the editor thanking her for her service 
to the community, and now includes 
tributes to her memory. 
Mrs. Avery is sorely missed and will 
be rightfully remembered as a commu-
nity leader for generations to come.

HELPING LAS VEGAS THROUGH 
THE PANDEMIC 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of my hometown, 
Las Vegas. 
What comes to mind when I say Las 
Vegas? Bright lights, slot machines, 
big shows, massive conventions, show-
girls with the big iconic feather head-
pieces. It is a magical place. 
But the glitz and glamour doesn’t 
happen on its own. Even though it feels 
that way, it is not magic. 
It is the result of the work of thou-
sands of Nevadans working in the en-
tertainment, tourism, and hospitality 
industry. I am talking about the Vegas 
performers, ticket takers, stage man-
agers, convention workers, and bar-
tenders. To them, Vegas isn’t a week-
end getaway or a drunken cliche, it is 
their livelihood, which sadly has been 
gutted by the COVID pandemic. 
Many of them don’t have jobs to go 
back to because the industry can’t 
thrive when people aren’t traveling. 
They are stuck until the pandemic is 
over. And because of that we need to 
help get them through this moment. 
The American Rescue Plan includes 
hundreds of billions of dollars for small 
businesses, laid off workers, and direct 
aid to families and communities like 
those in Las Vegas, including the $23 
billion to support the travel and tour-
ism industry, and the $1.25 billion in 
targeted relief for live venues. 
We need to support the venues and 
the workers that make our magical 
town the number one destination in 
the country, and we can do that by 
passing the American Rescue Plan. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to observe the deco-
rum of the House. 
f 
PROTECTING PUBLIC LANDS 
(Mr. PALMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
comment on H.R. 803, specifically, the 
debate I just heard. 
This bill does not protect public 
lands, it turns them into economic 
deserts off limits to public use and sen-
sible management practices. At some 
point we must recognize the damage 
that is done by these left-wing land 
grabs, to our economy, our commu-
nities, and even to our national secu-
rity when we make critical resources 
off limits. 
My Democratic colleagues are advo-
cating land use and management poli-
cies that are entirely misguided. As I 
listen to my Democratic colleagues’ 
speeches, I heard an almost religious 
devotion to the sites covered by this 
legislation. 
When I heard one Member talk about 
protecting the Grand Canyon from 
mining, even though mining is already 
prohibited there, I couldn’t help won-
dering what my colleagues would think 
if it turned out the Grand Canyon was 
the result of an ancient mining com-
pany. It would probably be fine if it fit 
their agenda.

ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
distinguished gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL), who, like me, served as 
a staffer for a Texas Senator in his ca-
reer, the great John Tower. 
CELEBRATING THE MEMORY OF DAISY BATES 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Texas for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise in cele-
bration of Black History Month. I rise 
in honor of the memory of Daisy Bates, 
a native Arkansan and civil rights 
hero. 
Daisy Bates was born in south Ar-
kansas in 1914 and moved to Little 
Rock in 1942. Active in the NAACP, 
Daisy and her husband, L.C., started 
the Arkansas State Press, a weekly 
newspaper, which they used to call at-
tention to racial injustices. 
In the face of violent threats, Mrs. 
Bates courageously led the movement 
to desegregate Little Rock Central 
High School, recruiting and mentoring 
the Little Rock Nine. 
Daisy Gatson Bates became an icon 
in the fight to end segregation in the 
Jim Crow South. She was the only 
woman to speak at the 1963 March on 
Washington, led by Dr. Martin Luther 
King. 
Daisy Bates is a hero to Arkansans 
and Americans, and I am proud to 
honor her legacy today, and I look for-
ward to her statue joining the pan-
theon of American leaders highlighted 
in the U.S. Capitol. 
NATO STATES ARE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR 
SHARE 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, on a cold 
Tuesday in January, an irritated Presi-
dent met with his National Security 
Council. During the meeting, the Presi-
dent was outspoken, and complained, 
We cannot continue to pay for the mili-
tary protection of Europe while the 
NATO states are not paying their fair 
share and living off the fat of the land. 
We have been very generous to Europe, 
and now it is time for us to look out 
for ourselves. 
Mr. Speaker, that quote urging Euro-
peans to pay their fair share in their 
own defense by way of their responsi-
bility to the North Atlantic Treaty Or-
ganization was not made by President 
Trump, it was not made by President 
Obama, or even George W. Bush. Mr. 
Speaker, that irritated President was 
John F. Kennedy. 
We are now nearly 60 years after that 
meeting, and 30 years following the re-
unification of Germany and the col-
lapse of the USSR. Yet, the debate con-
tinues.

H704 
February 25, 2021 
Recently, NATO held a 2-day video 
conference with the theme of increas-
ing NATO’s funding for our core deter-
rence and defense activities. NATO 
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg 
told the assembled allies that spending 
more together would demonstrate the 
strength of our commitment to Article 
5, our promise to each other. And it 
would contribute to fairer burden shar-
ing. Sound familiar? 
When then-candidate Donald Trump 
became President, only three of the 
then 28 countries were spending the 
agreed upon guideline figure of 2 per-
cent of gross domestic product on de-
fense. 
b 1845 
With 
President 
Trump’s 
urging, 
today, 7 countries out of the now 30 
NATO allies are meeting this impor-
tant benchmark. The United States is 
joined by its longtime allies, Great 
Britain and Greece. Yet the only other 
countries meeting the benchmark are 
countries that know well the risk of 
Soviet—and now Russian—threats or 
threats from external forces of terror. 
These are the formerly enslaved coun-
tries from behind the Iron Curtain: 
Bulgaria, 
Estonia, 
Poland, 
Latvia, 
Lithuania, and Romania. As Ameri-
cans, we salute their partnership, and 
we share in their renewed sense of free-
dom. 
Mr. Speaker, as we in the legislative 
branch of this government meet and 
confer with our parliamentary counter-
parts, as well as foreign ministers and 
finance ministers from our NATO al-
lies, let us urge cooperation with our 
promise to defend each other, but, 
more importantly, urge the rapid adop-
tion to achieve that fairer burden shar-
ing, a goal so long ago argued for by 
President Kennedy. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the gentleman for his commitment in 
being down here on the floor. We have 
this Special Order reserved tonight to 
talk about an issue that I think is fun-
damentally important to what we are 
seeing now today. And that is what I 
describe as the ideological cleansing of 
America, the silencing of dissent—can-
cel culture in common parlance today. 
It is a sickness that lies among us. It 
threatens to tear apart our Republic at 
the seams. It undermines our economic 
strength, our families, our schools, our 
churches, our culture at all levels, and 
even our military strength. That sick-
ness is indeed the ideological cleansing 
of America. 
We have witnessed in America in just 
a matter of months the shaming of 
Americans questioning COVID. They 
are not questioning its existence. They 
are questioning our response. They are 
questioning the fact that we have got 
people who are committing suicide, 
who are stuck, unable to see loved 
ones, or can’t get cancer screenings. 
They 
are 
questioning 
why 
hydroxychloroquine is one day okay 
and one day not okay, and then sud-
denly okay again. They are inquiring 
about the efficacy of masks. 
Do they work or not work? 
How well do they work? 
Where should we wear them? 
They question the removal of Ameri-
cans from social media, the coordi-
nated effort of technology companies 
to block companies or threaten to pull 
down news media outlets. 
We see examples of cancel culture in 
society are all around us. 
Ryan Anderson is a good friend of 
mine. His book is behind me, titled 
‘‘When Harry Became Sally,’’ respond-
ing to the transgender moment. It is an 
important work on civil rights and 
transgender 
policy. 
Well, 
it 
was 
deplatformed by Amazon and Apple 
without explanation this week. It has 
been on for 3 years. It is a good book, 
whether you agree with it or don’t 
agree with it. 
Are we really into book burning? 
Is that where we are? 
Is that what we have become as a 
country that supposedly values free-
dom and the free exchange of ideas? 
A book written by a good man, a 
PhD, on a topic that matters, ‘‘When 
Harry Became Sally.’’ 
Am I going to get canceled? 
Is C–SPAN going to cancel this? 
Is Speaker PELOSI going to cancel 
this because this is somehow offensive? 
It is a book with ideas researched and 
offered. That is where we are as a coun-
try. 
Gina Carano was recently canceled 
by Disney for tweeting a comparison of 
Nazi Germany rounding up Jews for the 
current hate doxing and targeting of 
fellow Americans for political views. 
Now, should she make that compari-
son? 
I don’t know. But we are a free coun-
try where people are supposed to have 
the free exchange of ideas. And if there 
is anything that should bind us to-
gether, it should be a unanimous belief 
that standing up against tyranny and 
standing up against this kind of cleans-
ing is something that this body—all 435 
of us—should agree to. We see it from 
college campuses to religious schools, 
to 
small 
businesses, 
to 
corporate 
boardrooms. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to have 
more to say on this. I have some of my 
colleagues here who want to join. So I 
am going to yield first to my good 
friend from Texas, MICHAEL CLOUD. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman for taking this 
moment to speak on this. I cannot 
imagine a more important topic for us 
right now in this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, we are unique in his-
tory in that our Nation rests on the un-
derstanding that our inalienable rights 
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness are not a grant from the govern-
ment; they are a gift from Almighty 
God. And among these enshrined in our 
First Amendment is the freedom of 
speech, which is the most essential 
freedom, along with the freedom of re-
ligion. 
The peace and tranquility of our en-
tire Republic is based on the under-
standing that we have a right to have 
our voice heard and that we have a 
right to have peaceful public discourse 
and dissent. That is how we come up 
with good legislation. That is how to 
have good policy. That is how we avoid 
conflict and wars on our soil. 
But we have entered a most troubling 
time in our Nation. This cancel culture 
has persisted, and it needs to stop. The 
unilateral march of legislation meant 
not to protect our liberties, but, rath-
er, force the American people to con-
form to woke ideology in this House 
needs to stop. 
Then there is big tech that canceled 
conservatives while allowing for liberal 
Members of this body to repeatedly 
call for unrest in our streets and raise 
money to bail out violent rioters, not 
to mention providing a platform for 
Communist China terrorist groups and 
the like. This hypocrisy is not over-
looked. 
Recently traveling throughout my 
district the last couple weeks, I came 
across a few immigrants in my commu-
nity. I know them. They came up to me 
concerned about what we are in at this 
point in our Nation. Some of us who 
are so privileged to be born in this 
country where we have inherited these 
wonderful liberties might not see the 
signs so readily as people who have 
come from Ecuador, Cuba, and Iran. 
But these individuals came up to me 
because they are very concerned. They 
are concerned that they left this and 
now they are seeing it be rooted and es-
tablished here in our Nation. 
Ironically, the one from Iran was 
concerned because she was talking to 
me and she had liked a post about our 
taking out of Soleimani and she got 
banned from Instagram following that. 
She knows firsthand what is going on 
in Iran. She is a first-generation immi-
grant. I was troubled, especially when 
she looked at me and said: We have 
more freedom of speech in Iran at this 
moment—this is her opinion—than we 
do right here right now. No one is try-
ing to cancel people, you can speak 
freely against the government there. 
Now, I am not saying Iran is a won-
derful place to live. I am thankful to be 
here in the United States of America, 
but we are heading down a troubling 
path. 
I remember being at an event just a 
couple days ago. It was before the elec-
tion. Some lady was there, and she was 
talking to me about her motivation for 
being involved in the public discourse. 
She came up to me and said: I am from 
Ecuador. I remember escaping. 
Her parents did not make it out, but 
she made it out. She didn’t call it ‘‘to 
the United States of America.’’ She 
called it ‘‘to freedom country.’’ 
She said: We cannot lose freedom 
country. I am here to support this, I 
am here to work, and I am here to do 
whatever I can because we cannot lose 
freedom country. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here to stand up 
along with our colleagues because we 
cannot lose freedom country. It is ex-
tremely and essentially important that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H705 
February 25, 2021 
we in this House and people across the 
United States of America stand up in 
this hour at this time. 
Ronald Reagan once said—and I have 
said this before to many people, en-
couraging them how important it is to 
get involved in the process and also to 
thank our veterans—‘‘Freedom is never 
more than one generation away from 
extinction. We didn’t pass it to our 
children in the bloodstream. It must be 
fought for, protected, and handed on 
for them to do the same.’’ 
I thought about that quote. There is 
another part of it that has resonated 
with me even more and more in this 
time, and it is: ‘‘Or one day we will 
spend our sunset years telling our chil-
dren and our children’s children what 
it was once like in the United States 
where men were free.’’ 
God forbid that we continue down 
this path and reach that point where 
we have to tell our kids and grandkids 
about what it was once like to live in 
the beloved United States where men 
were free. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for setting aside this Special Order. I 
cannot imagine a more important 
topic. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I just want to 
say to my friend from Texas that I 
know he has a heart for immigrants 
who come to the United States of 
America. We both live in Texas. We 
both deal with an open border and we 
deal with the issue of immigration on a 
regular basis. 
Too often when you talk about can-
cel culture, if I dare to say that we 
should have a secure border in the 
United States of America and that I be-
lieve that is pro-immigrant, that that 
undermines the power of cartels, that 
makes it less likely that immigrants 
are abused, also protects us, protects 
us from the dangers of fentanyl. That 
is the kind of canceling that we see 
every single day. 
Oh, you want a secure border? 
You hate Brown people. 
It is as if my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have some sort of mo-
nopoly on being able to say things 
about Brown people, and here I am try-
ing to protect our border for the bet-
terment of the United States and the 
immigrants who seek to come here, 
and somehow I am a bigot. The very 
structures put in place by the Obama- 
Biden administration are called cages 
for kids. 
And now what has happened? 
The Biden administration is having 
an uh-oh moment because their absurd 
policies of open borders are attracting 
people to come across our border. Now 
they are saying: Oh, no, what do we do 
with unaccompanied children? 
Well, who the heck could have seen 
this coming? 
Yet somehow we are canceled for be-
lieving in a secure border. 
The gentleman from south Texas, 
who I know has a heart for immi-
grants— 
Mr. CLOUD. I certainly do. 
Mr. ROY. And has a family who does 
as well, does the gentleman have 
thoughts on that? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CLOUD). 
Mr. CLOUD. Sure. You know my fam-
ily, you know my wife. I have had 
those comments put on me that I 
somehow don’t like Brown people and 
that I am somehow racist. They fail 
sometimes to look at my family photo. 
My wife is an immigrant. I didn’t 
marry her because she was an immi-
grant. I married because I loved her. I 
met her when she was 15. I was 17 at 
the time. We had a long-distance rela-
tionship. I met her back before Al Gore 
invented the internet. 
Mr. Speaker, I can tell you what an 
honor it was for her to stand there in 
the U.S. courthouse, raise her hand and 
take the Pledge of Allegiance for the 
first time and become a citizen of this 
great country. 
So we understand that there is a 
proper way to do immigration. We 
want a big, beautiful gate to this coun-
try. But to say that we need to secure 
our communities and keep out the car-
tel activity, I serve on the Inter-
parliamentary Group between the U.S. 
and Mexico, so I have had the oppor-
tunity to talk with our colleagues in 
Mexico. I talk to them about how arro-
gant of a notion it is for us to assume 
that the way we heal the world’s ills is 
to bring everybody to the United 
States. That notion is uniquely Amer-
ican arrogant. 
We want people to prosper every-
where. And what we know from our 
unique history is that if you embrace 
the principles this Nation was founded 
upon, you can have the same sort of 
prosperity. You can have your people 
prosper everywhere. 
When I said that thought, we got re-
sounding applause from them because 
they understand that our wanting to 
secure their borders, we want their 
communities to thrive, we want our 
communities along the border to be 
protected, and we want migrants not to 
be persecuted and abused along the 
way. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I agree with 
the gentleman. If you take that view, 
you are labeled a bigot. If you take the 
view that we want a secure border, you 
are labeled as someone who wants to 
keep people out of this country. 
If you dare to say what you just said, 
which is that maybe we should think 
through how to make sure that Mexico, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador 
are strong so that—by the way, the 
first lady of Guatemala was visiting 
and said something along the lines of: 
All of these caravans and all of the car-
tels are driving a lot of our people out 
of our country, and it is hurting our 
country. 
I am told from the other side of the 
aisle that it is compassionate to have 
open borders, and then we are labeled 
as bigots. 
I know the gentleman has somewhere 
to go. I appreciate the gentleman’s re-
marks and passion for this issue. May 
God bless the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend and colleague from Texas, 
Congressman CHIP ROY, for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I have said it before and 
I will say it again: cancel culture has 
become a pillar of the left. 
Today, cancel culture took on toy po-
tatoes, but not a sitting Governor ac-
cused of sexual assault. That is where 
we have come to. 
From Kevin Hart to Gina Carano, the 
woke mob will go after decades-old 
comments, and in Gina’s case, for sim-
ply being a Conservative. The woke 
mob now includes big tech, major cor-
porations, and the Hollywood elites at 
Disney who fired Ms. Carano for the 
crime of—wait for it—posting conserv-
ative content on social media. 
They tried to come after me, too. 
Twitter tried to cancel me. It didn’t 
work. The fake news at CNN and other 
outlets also tried to cancel me for sim-
ply walking around the Capitol with 
my family. That didn’t work either. 
Mr. Speaker, it will never work be-
cause I refuse to bow to the cancel 
mob. 
We are a nation that has always had 
the audacity to dream, the strength to 
lead, and the boldness to speak our 
minds. We must stand tall and kneel 
before God. Scripture says that every 
knee will bow and every tongue will 
confess Jesus is Lord. 
Now, that is an audacious statement 
in America right now: Jesus is Lord. 
Why is that such a controversy? 
Because there is power in the name 
of Jesus. 
b 1900 
This isn’t the first time Christians 
have been attacked for professing the 
Lordship of Jesus. 
If you go to the Book of Acts, Peter 
and John were arrested. It says: Now as 
they spoke to the people, the priests, 
the captain of the temple and the Sad-
ducees came upon them, greatly dis-
turbed that they taught the people and 
preached in Jesus the resurrection 
from the dead. And they laid hands on 
them and they put them in custody 
until the next day for it was already 
evening. However, many of those who 
heard the word believed and the num-
ber of men came to be about 5,000. 
There were 5,000 salvations because 
someone had the boldness to speak in 
the name of Jesus. It goes on. 
Now, when they saw the boldness— 
their boldness was tangible. It was evi-
dent to the people around them. It 
wasn’t in a prayer closet. It wasn’t hid-
den. It was out in front. They saw the 
boldness of Peter and John and per-
ceived that they were uneducated and 
untrained men. 
That means that they didn’t know 
the languages that they were speaking 
in. They were speaking in unknown 
languages. 
They marveled and they analyzed 
that they had been with Jesus. Their

boldness was so tangible, so intense the 
people around them knew that they 
had been in the presence of Jesus. Wow. 
It goes on to say: What shall we do to 
these men? For, indeed that a notable 
miracle has been done through them. It 
is evident to all who dwell in Jeru-
salem and we cannot deny it, but so 
that it spreads further among the peo-
ple, let us severely threaten them— 
Whew, 
sounds 
like 
America. 
That 
sounds really familiar right now—that 
we would severely threaten them, that 
from now on, they speak to no man in 
this name. They wouldn’t even say the 
name, in this name. 
So they called them, and they com-
manded them not to speak at all, nor 
teach. They were not allowed to speak 
or teach in the name of Jesus. 
But Peter and John answered and 
said to them, Whether it is right in the 
sight of God to listen to you more than 
God, you judge. 
It goes on to say exactly what God 
will do if you remain bold and strong in 
your convictions and if you refuse to 
bow down to the cancel mob, to the 
woke culture. 
Peter and John spoke out. Now, Lord, 
look on their threats and grant to Your 
servants boldness as we may speak 
Your word by stretching out Your 
hands, hands to heal, that signs and 
wonders may be done through the 
name of Your holy servant, Jesus. 
This is the boldness that God is look-
ing for right now. He said, if we cry out 
to Him, He will hear us, and He will 
heal our land. 
This cancel culture isn’t just to keep 
us quiet; it is to stop the very plan and 
movement of God Almighty. But I have 
read the end of the book and we win. 
Glory to God. God bless America. 
Do not give up the faith and hope in 
God. He will turn all shame into glory. 
Mr. ROY. Well, I appreciate the gen-
tlewoman from Colorado. I will tell 
you, you know, as I was thinking 
through the times we are in right now, 
the Book of Acts is my favorite book in 
the Bible. 
And when you—you know, I look at 
the arrows that some are taking today 
for standing up for their beliefs and 
some of the things that are happening 
today; and then you remember that we 
are not in the middle of a circle yet, 
getting stoned. 
You remember what those men did 
and what they faced in the early 
church, and it inspires us to know, to 
have the strength that we need to have. 
And this is true of all faiths. This is 
true of all Americans. It is instructive 
to stand up in faith when you believe 
something in your soul and in your 
heart. 
And we, as Americans, when Patrick 
Henry gave his famous speech at St. 
John’s Church in Richmond, Virginia, 
in that famous speech, ‘‘Give Me Lib-
erty Or Give Me Death,’’ that is the 
founding building block of this Nation. 
And it is that liberty, that liberty ex-
pressed in the First Amendment of the 
Constitution, which is under assault 
today on a bill voted on the floor of 
this body today in the so-called Equal-
ity Act, with a direct assault on the 
First Amendment of the United States, 
a direct assault on religious liberty, a 
direct assault, basically. It is the tyr-
anny over the mind of man. 
I am inspired by the Book of Acts, 
and I assume that the gentlewoman 
from Colorado agrees. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Absolutely. Abso-
lutely. It is an ongoing testimony of 
even the lives that we are living today. 
Our stories, I believe, will be recorded 
as there are a cloud of witnesses that 
are watching eagerly what we are 
going to do. They have been waiting for 
this time and this season and they are 
watching the sons of men. They are 
watching us like never before. 
Jesus came here and He showed us 
how to live, not as God, but as men, 
anointed by the spirit of God, to walk 
in grace, not just a wishy-washy, cover 
up your mistakes kind of grace, it is 
this boldness. It is empowerment. It is 
God’s ability working in and through 
you. And I am very much inspired by 
the Book of Acts and many others. 
Mr. ROY. I appreciate the gentle-
woman from Colorado, and I appreciate 
our joint commitment to the Lord Al-
mighty and liberty in this country. 
And I would just say before I yield, I 
think, to the gentleman from Georgia 
next, a couple of thoughts. 
You know, we are talking today 
about cancel culture. We are talking 
about the silencing of dissent, the 
cleansing of ideology in the public 
square in America. It is truly an ideo-
logical cleansing, but it is always not 
direct. 
I alluded to it when I was talking to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CLOUD) 
about immigration; that if we dare 
stand up for secure borders, we are a 
bigot. It happens all the time. You hate 
Brown people. You are a bigot. 
Today, I stood up against the Equal-
ity Act. The first thing out of the indi-
visible crowd in Austin and San Anto-
nio, you’re a bigot. You’re transphobic. 
Dare stand up for what you believe. 
Oh, my gosh. The gentleman from 
Texas says that there is a man and 
woman. Bigot. All right? 
I mean, this is where we are today. 
And you know, look, if you want your 
child to actually be educated in a 
school, then despite the science, you 
don’t care about public health and you 
want teachers to die. Right? 
All last year, running against an op-
ponent in Austin, it was, oh, you want 
people to die. You don’t care about the 
science. 
If you want to keep your business 
open to keep your livelihood going, you 
just want to survive. You are a barber 
in Dallas, Texas, and you just want to 
stay working to pay for your kids and 
your family, put bread on the table. 
Well, you are just greedy, and you 
hate science. 
If you think Dr. Fauci is incon-
sistent—I mean, I am just going to be 
nice and say inconsistent—if you think 
Dr. Fauci is inconsistent, sometimes 
making stuff up, maybe to be on the 
front cover of a magazine, and maybe 
we ought to hear from 20 scientists in-
stead of one, well, suddenly, you hate 
science. 
If you say that COVID has been po-
liticized, as I did last year, or question 
any aspect of it, not that it exists, not 
that people are getting sick—I have 
had it—not that you want to protect 
your family—I canceled Thanksgiving 
because my dad is 78 and had polio— 
but if you question any of it, you are 
calling it a hoax. 
If you want to go to church, you are 
reckless. 
If you believe men are men and 
women are women, you are a bigot. 
If you think it is wrong to let bio-
logical boys compete against your 
daughter in a sports competition, or 
you don’t want your daughter to have 
to share a locker room with a male, 
you are a bigot. 
I mean, when are we going to sit 
down, roll our sleeves up and actually 
do the work of the American people, in-
stead of sitting here firing shots across 
everybody and saying, well, you are a 
bigot. 
I yield to my good friend from Geor-
gia, Mr. HICE. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. I appreciate the 
gentleman’s leadership on this and he’s 
a very dear friend from Texas. And I 
am grateful. 
Listen, I don’t know that there are 
many issues that are much more sig-
nificant, if any more significant, than 
what we are watching unfold in our so-
ciety these days, with the cancel cul-
ture movement. And the gentleman 
brought up so many great examples. 
Everyone certainly, I believe, probably 
everyone on this side of the aisle has 
experienced this cancel culture in one 
degree or another, and it is, frankly, 
not a new thing. It started quite some 
time back. 
But certainly, it has built to the 
point of enormous momentum now to 
the point of literally destroying lives, 
destroying businesses, destroying ca-
reers, and that is what is disturbing to 
me. 
And I would just go on to say that 
this cancel culture—two main points 
that I just want to bring up, and I 
would love to have a bit of dialogue 
with the gentleman on this. 
But number one is: What is under-
neath it? What is causing it? What is 
the purpose? What is the motive behind 
cancel culture? 
I don’t think we need to just deal 
with the results of it, but what is be-
hind it. And I would suggest that it is 
a lust for power. And, as a result, there 
is an attempt to intimidate, an at-
tempt to cancel, an attempt to threat-
en, and it is also that I am king of the 
hill and you are not. 
There is this desire for power behind 
the cancel culture movement, and I be-
lieve that is a significant issue, and I 
would like to hear the gentleman’s 
thoughts on that, and then I will come

back to another thought that I have 
and bounce that off you as well 
Mr. ROY. Yeah. There is no question. 
In my view, what we are seeing today 
is the assertion of power over the mind 
of America, right? And it is just hap-
pening as we see it. 
We have got a fence with razor wire 
around the Capitol. We were all horri-
fied, sitting right here, all of us here in 
the body who were here on January 6. 
We all want to protect each other. 
But we also have a duty to lead. We 
also have a duty to have a Capitol that 
is open; to figure out a way to secure 
the body without sending signals to the 
world that somehow this is a military 
state. 
You walk around the Capitol and 
there are people in camouflage. There 
is a fence. I can’t even walk around 
D.C. We are harming business. We are 
telling the American people that, nope, 
sorry, you can’t come here, all in the 
name of a virus or then what happened 
on January 6. 
That is all about power. That is all 
about message. Okay? 
I do not believe for a minute, with all 
due respect, that that is about actual 
security of this building and this com-
plex. That is about projecting a mes-
sage to the American people. That is 
what the magnetometers are for. That 
is not to keep us safe. It is not. 
It is not the highest and best use of 
the Capitol Police to be having 20 peo-
ple around this floor every day; lit-
erally having Members of Congress 
duly elected by the people to have to 
go through magnetometers. You have 
got to go through security to get in the 
building. It is all a show. And that is 
all a projection of power. And that is 
what the Equality Act was today. 
And the last thing I will say is my 
point about immigration earlier. That 
whole point is: It makes no sense to be 
yelling about kids in cages, when any 
rational human being knows you are 
trying to figure out what to do with 
this child, a child that could be being 
abused by this guy who claims to be his 
or her uncle, and you are trying to 
keep him or her safe. You can’t just let 
him go. You have got to do something 
with them. 
I mean, I am sorry we don’t have 
four-star resorts up and down the Rio 
Grande to put these children into, but 
go down and work at Border Patrol— 
who, by the way, are majority His-
panic—dealing with immigrants com-
ing here through policies that attract 
them. 
That is all about power. Kids in 
cages. Republicans are evil. Repub-
licans are bigots. They hate Brown peo-
ple. It is all about power. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Absolutely. 
That is extremely well said and very 
potent in the way you presented that. 
And it has come to the point, even in 
just the last couple of days, I had a 
woman face to face I was speaking with 
about this, and she was hesitant to get 
involved in a relatively small way in 
trying to make a stand in her local 
community. 
And her words to me, I am afraid 
that if I do this, the FBI is going to 
come knocking at my door. And she 
had received those kinds of threats, 
those kind of whatever. She didn’t go 
into details with me, the specifics of 
what had brought her to that point. 
But the realization to me is this can-
cel culture is like a cancer that is now 
infiltrating our society and its tenta-
cles are reaching, they are far-reach-
ing. And what contributes to part of 
this, I am afraid, we are participating 
in right here in this Chamber. 
And a quick example, we just passed 
the Equality Act. And I could not help 
but think, while this is being passed, 
and even some questions I had with it, 
sure, we don’t want discrimination for 
anyone. This is the land of the free. Ev-
eryone has rights. 
b 1915 
But the bill itself specifically says 
there are no religious exemptions to 
this, that RFRA does not apply, which 
means people who have deeply held re-
ligious beliefs are going to be canceled 
from participating in their routine life 
if they disagree with the premise of 
this bill, and if they personally have 
convictions otherwise, that is being 
forced upon them. 
It is very concerning to me that we 
in this Chamber are actually partici-
pating in throwing gas on the fire of 
this whole cancel culture, even with 
legislation that is coming out of this 
body. I would like to hear your 
thoughts on that. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would ask 
how much time we have left in our Spe-
cial Order. Sorry for surprising the 
Chair. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 25 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would say to 
the gentleman from Georgia that I 
could not agree more, and I have spo-
ken a little bit about the Equality Act. 
The only thing I would add to it—and I 
said this earlier on the floor about the 
Equality Act—my wife and I, products 
of public school, K through law school, 
undergrad, law school, we currently 
send our kids to a private Christian 
school, not an easy thing for us to af-
ford. We are fine, we are blessed, but it 
is a lot of work to make that happen. 
Why do we do that? It is because, un-
fortunately, increasingly those with 
beliefs and values that they want to be 
able to have their children experience, 
we are being forced into the corner. 
We are being forced to kind of be 
shoved back away from mainstream so-
ciety. I mean, forget just saying Merry 
Christmas. I mean, it is just hostile to 
our values, hostile to our beliefs, 
teaching our children something dif-
ferent than that there is one man and 
one woman. These are the things that 
are happening every day across Amer-
ica. 
To my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, I would say whatever frustra-
tions you have about the previous 
President, just understand this: Presi-
dent Trump represents a large number 
of men and women across this country 
who are feeling exactly what we are 
saying right here. They are frustrated 
and angry about what is happening to 
their country. They are scared. They 
believe the power of government will 
be used against them, and in many 
cases, we have seen evidence of it. 
The point of this is not to just rant 
about it. It is that we should be having 
a debate and a dialogue, and we need to 
come together as a Congress and do our 
job to do what is right for the people of 
this country. I appreciate the gen-
tleman from Georgia very much. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from the great State of Georgia 
(Mrs. GREENE), your colleague. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I appreciate this conversation to-
night about cancel culture. I think it is 
one of the most relevant topics that we 
should be discussing more, and I am 
really glad to talk about this. 
I think this past year we have seen 
more things canceled in our American 
history than we have at any other 
time. In the past year, starting with 
the virus, that has been politicized. I 
say that, I believe that, along with mil-
lions and millions of Americans that 
believe it. 
We saw, starting with schools got 
canceled, business got canceled, jobs 
got canceled, people had to stay home. 
Then things got further. Sports were 
canceled, prom was canceled, gradua-
tion was canceled, social life was can-
celed, vacations, movies, entertain-
ment, restaurants, and the list goes on 
and on. Basically, the ability to pursue 
happiness in the United States of 
America got canceled due to COVID–19 
and the politicization of it because it 
was an election year. 
I can’t think of anything worse. I 
have been privileged to be a business 
owner for almost two decades, and it 
has been a joy in my life to be able to 
function as a business owner, to em-
ploy people, to do business in the mar-
ketplace and have the freedom to do 
that. But over the past year, many 
small businesses have been shut down, 
along with many big businesses. 
Dreams for people starting a business 
have been canceled. But even more 
than that, the belief that conservative 
opinions and thoughts and statements 
and just beliefs are being canceled and 
considered dangerous. 
The fact that millions and millions of 
Americans support President Trump, 
still support President Trump, and are 
angered that he has been canceled is 
unbelievable to me. 
You see, America is the greatest 
country in the world, and I say it over 
and over. We are all blessed to be 
Americans. We are blessed that we are 
equal, and we should have equal voices. 
We are given that with our First 
Amendment, with freedom of speech. 
But today, it is not looked at that 
way. People that support President 
Trump are considered to be possibly 
domestic terrorists. How can that be?

You see, we don’t look at America that 
way. We don’t look at people that we 
disagree with politically that way, not 
at all. 
President Trump was canceled on 
Twitter. I understand what that is like. 
I have been suspended multiple times 
on Twitter. I have been in Facebook 
jail multiple times for stating my opin-
ions, things I think and feel. It 
shouldn’t be that way, where people 
are canceled by companies. 
We are moving in an era of corporate 
communism to where corporations and 
businesses can force their views and po-
litical opinions, and force it on their 
customers. That is absolutely wrong. It 
should not be happening. But that is 
where we are today. 
Where do we go from here? Today, we 
saw my Democrat colleagues here in 
Congress cancel gender. This is not up 
for debate, and it should not be shock-
ing for us to say there is only male and 
female. That is not a shocking state-
ment. It is science. There are only two 
sets of chromosomes. They also can-
celed women’s rights, religious free-
dom, and the ability for little girls to 
have privacy in the bathroom. 
This cancel culture has gone too far, 
and we have to change that. The media 
is addicting America to hate, and the 
media is addicting people to the idea 
that they can cancel out someone’s 
opinion that they don’t agree with. 
Mr. ROY, would you like to elaborate 
on that? 
Mr. ROY. Yes. One of the things that 
you made me think of is how much 
cancel culture is now getting rooted in 
government and, in fact, the institu-
tion in which we are currently stand-
ing. The gentlewoman is well aware 
that my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle stripped you of your ability to 
serve and sit on committees, in an un-
precedented action, for things that you 
said before the election, that you have 
addressed on the floor of this House. 
That is canceling. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Yes. 
Mr. ROY. We are in a situation right 
now where this body is now refusing to 
work. Democrats are refusing to work 
with Republicans. They are threat-
ening to hold up and block their legis-
lation because they dared to object to 
the electors, a proposition, by the way, 
that I disagreed with, on my side of the 
aisle. I spoke right there. I stated my 
disagreement with my Republican col-
leagues. 
But it is perfectly normal speech and 
debate under the Constitution and the 
laws, under an act passed in 1887, one 
that my Democrat colleagues have en-
gaged in themselves: Ms. WATERS from 
California, for sure, Mr. RASKIN from 
Maryland, others who have objected. 
Now, Democrats in this body want to 
cancel my Republican colleagues. That 
is how bad it has gotten. Cancel cul-
ture is now in this body. 
I have a couple more colleagues here, 
Mrs. GREENE, but do you have a closing 
thought? 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Thank 
you, Mr. ROY. I really appreciate that. 
Yes, being canceled in Congress after 35 
days, being stripped of my committee 
membership, is not something that I 
ever expected, and I think it is com-
pletely wrong. 
Statements and things that I had 
said that I addressed here and with my 
colleagues that happened before I even 
campaigned for Congress, certainly not 
anything I did as a Member of Con-
gress, but that cancelation is taken to 
an extreme, and it should not happen. 
Then the fact that we did object to 
electoral college votes, that is some-
thing we are able to do. You disagreed 
with us, and here we are, having a per-
fectly great conversation. I wish we 
could have the same type of conversa-
tion with our Democrat colleagues be-
cause they have, indeed, objected to 
electoral college votes in the past, I 
think, every Presidential election for 
the past 20 years or so. Thank you for 
reminding me that, and thank you for 
setting this up tonight. 
Mr. ROY. I am going to yield to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania. I would 
ask the Speaker how much time we 
have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 16 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROY. I thank the Speaker. Right 
before I yield to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania, I want to appreciate his 
service, his service to the country, 
both in the military and now in Con-
gress. I know he has a passion for this 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend 
from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate Mr. ROY, my great friend from 
Texas. I appreciate the sacrifices that 
he has made on behalf of this great Na-
tion. 
If you know me, you know I am a fan 
of books because I think, in this tran-
sient, throwaway society, they are a 
record of things that happened in the 
past. So, like I said, if you know me, 
you know I love books. They never 
asked me, because I am not running for 
President, what books do you rec-
ommend? But if I were running for 
President and they ever deigned to ask 
me, this would be one. This is by a guy 
named Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn. It is 
called ‘‘Warning to the West.’’ It is 
hard to come by. It is a little expen-
sive, but it is well worth the effort. I 
just want to read an excerpt to you 
where he is thinking about the West as 
he sits in a Russian gulag. 
‘‘We contemplate the West from what 
will be your future, or we look back 70 
years to see our past suddenly repeat-
ing itself today. And what we see is al-
ways the same as it was then: adults 
deferring to the opinion of their chil-
dren; the younger generation carried 
away by shallow, worthless ideas; pro-
fessors scared of being unfashionable; 
journalists refusing to take responsi-
bility for the words they squander so 
easily; universal sympathy for revolu-
tionary extremists; people with serious 
objections unable or unwilling to voice 
them; the majority passively obsessed 
by a feeling of doom; feeble govern-
ments; societies whose defensive reac-
tions have become paralyzed; spiritual 
confusion leading to political upheaval. 
What will happen as a result of all this 
lies ahead of us. But the time is near, 
and from bitter memory, we can easily 
predict what these events will be.’’ 
Mr. ROY. Will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PERRY. I certainly will. 
Mr. ROY. I also have a quote here I 
was going to close with from Alexsandr 
Solzhenitsyn because it is so on point. 
I am going to go ahead and do it now 
rather than closing with it because you 
just went there. 
He said this in another part of that 
book: 
What was drummed in our ears as political 
courses, we have now internalized. Live com-
fortably and all will be well ever after. We 
lie to ourselves to preserve our peace of 
mind. It is not they who should be blamed, 
but ourselves. One can object but cannot 
imagine what to do. Gags have been stuffed 
into our mouths. Nobody wants to listen to 
us, and nobody asks our opinion. How can we 
force them to listen to us? It is impossible to 
change their minds. Some will lose their 
jobs, but there are no loopholes for anybody 
who wants to be honest. 
Now, that may sound like a diatribe 
from a conservative talk radio host 
today, but it wasn’t. It was him. 
Mr. PERRY. It was a guy who lived 
it, who saw it happen, who lived under 
the oppression of a Russian gulag, im-
prisoned for decades, and watched the 
West, 
watched 
66 
million 
souls 
exterminated on the border of Russia 
and Europe, and Europe did nothing 
about it. 
We are in this Capitol today, as Chip 
has already said, surrounded by razor 
wire and fences. Free speech, they are 
saying: Well, you have free speech. The 
government is not censoring you. The 
government is not canceling you. 
Well, in this age where Google, 
Facebook, these platforms have 95, 99 
percent market share, whatever the 
heck it is, when you are taken off that, 
your free speech is taken away, effec-
tively. 
We are not here to talk to just each 
other. Free speech means you can talk 
to each other, everybody else. So it is 
not about being able to just have a con-
versation with yourself in a cell. Free 
speech is about discussing ideas, and 
some 
of 
them 
are 
going 
to 
be 
unpalatable. 
There were book burnings back at 
this time because they wanted to de-
stroy ideas. We are not afraid of ideas. 
We are afraid of the advent of com-
munism and socialism in our country, 
but we are not afraid to discuss it be-
cause we know that our ideas will win. 
What we are afraid of is not being 
able to discuss it, and that is what is 
happening. That is happening all across 
America, whether you are Project 
Veritas, whether you are President 
Trump, whether you are MARJORIE 
TAYLOR GREENE and you say the wrong 
thing. You say the wrong thing, and it 
is not about disagreement for the other 
side; it is about obliteration of your 
thought.

This is a very, very dangerous preci-
pice that we stand on, and we know the 
outcome. Solzhenitsyn, even though he 
was discredited—imagine, discredited 
by the Soviet Union and the Russians. 
But he came to America, and he tried 
to tell us over and over and over again. 
Many people know, but my good 
friend from Texas talked about the 
concern the American people have. 
They are scared. 
b 1930 
They are not scared of their neigh-
bor. They are not scared of a Demo-
crat. They are not scared of a Repub-
lican. They are scared of their govern-
ment. This is a government of and for 
the people, by the people. This is our 
government. The government doesn’t 
own us; we own it. The government is 
supposed to fear us. 
You know, I tell people, it didn’t end 
or it didn’t begin with gulags and slave 
labor work camps where people died of 
exposure, starvation, exhaustion. It 
didn’t start with that. It started with 
what we are talking about right now, 
with razor wire and fences around your 
Capitol and the inability to say what 
you want to say. That is where it 
starts. 
We don’t have to ask: Well, where 
does it end? 
We know where it ends. 
I thank the good gentleman from 
Texas for this opportunity. You know 
that we will stand right with you in 
this crusade to keep America free and 
to keep speech free. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I 
know that is true and I know your 
heart for service, and I know wearing 
the uniform of the military of the 
United States meant a lot to you and 
that your service here means a lot. 
Mr. Speaker, as I get ready to yield 
to my friend from West Virginia, I 
would add that my colleagues across 
the other side of the aisle are effec-
tively canceling Congress. I mean, it is 
pretty extraordinary when the mem-
bers of a body essentially act to cancel 
its own institution. 
Proxy voting. Half of my Democratic 
colleagues are never here. About half of 
the time I look over there and you look 
at the number of people there, and they 
are voting from home. By the way, the 
rules suggest that is supposed to be di-
rectly tied to the pandemic. But do you 
know how many of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle—and maybe 
increasingly a few on my side of the 
aisle—have been here voting and then 
submit the proxy form and then fly 
home? 
It happens. 
We are turning this institution on its 
head. We have remote hearings that 
are halfway functional, where you sit 
there for an hour trying to hear each 
other. We have no regular schedule. It 
is come and go. It takes hours to vote. 
We have no regular order. We have 
massive bills. We have things being 
done in smoke-filled rooms. We never 
get to amend. We never get to debate. 
We never get to actually have an ac-
tual discussion on the floor of the 
House. And we have fence and razor 
wire around the Capitol. 
Tell me how Democrats are not can-
celing Congress. You might as well just 
say Speaker PELOSI can just pass a bill 
by herself. 
I know my friend from West Virginia 
is going to talk a little bit about 
spending, and the only thing that I will 
add to my point here about order is 
that we are going to be passing a $2 
trillion monstrosity of a bill in the 
next week with no actual debate or 
amendment on the floor of this body; 
no real review by the members of this 
body. That is an absolute travesty. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY). 
SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE AND THE UNBORN 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, I will 
talk a little bit about some concerns 
and, generally, about the sanctity of 
human life and the unborn. 
I rise today in memory of the over 60 
million babies who have been killed 
through abortion since the Supreme 
Court’s disastrous decision Roe v. 
Wade. As a nation, we have taken ex-
traordinary steps to protect public 
health 
and 
save 
lives 
amid 
the 
coronavirus outbreak, but there is a 
huge contradiction when it comes to 
protecting human life in the womb. 
Protecting all human life should be a 
bipartisan issue. Yet, today, President 
Biden is driving policies like taxpayer 
funding of abortion and naming pro- 
abortion extremist Xavier Becerra as 
the Health and Human Services Sec-
retary. 
As recently as 2012, President Biden 
restated his long-held view that human 
life begins at conception. He said: 
‘‘With regard to abortion, I accept my 
church’s position that life begins at 
conception.’’ 
Well, it is not only a religious belief, 
but it is also a scientific fact that 
human 
life 
begins 
at 
conception. 
Thanks to modern scientific advance-
ments, we now can visually see and 
know the personhood of preborn chil-
dren. 
Doctors can operate on babies in the 
womb to save their lives. We know a 
preborn baby’s heart starts to beat at 
about 6 weeks. Nails begin to form at 
10 weeks, and babies have fingerprints 
by 13 weeks. 
It is time to give a voice to the voice-
less. It is time for the law to acknowl-
edge the dignity of the preborn babies 
who are the most helpless among us. 
I urge my fellow Members of Con-
gress to join me in defense of all 
human life, standing up for all human 
life. I urge President Biden to actually 
enact his personally held views that he 
acknowledges that it begins at concep-
tion. I think we actually all know that. 
It is a scientific fact. 
The reconciliation bill that is coming 
up, there are pro-life concerns in this 
bill. For starters, it fails to include the 
traditional what we call the high pro-
tections. That is a longstanding policy 
in Congress that your taxpayer dollars 
do not go for abortions. This bill 
waives that. It enables taxpayer fund-
ing of abortion. 
There are more than $414 billion tax-
payer dollars, supposedly intended for 
COVID–19 relief, that have no Hyde 
protections. 
So we are talking a lot about the 
cancel culture. You have, on the one 
hand, a division in this country. Many 
of us believe it is the taking of a 
human life, it is killing, it is murder; 
and we object to that. But instead of 
respecting our views, you actually 
want to take money from us through 
taxes and use our actual dollars to kill 
children. If you are going to talk about 
cancel culture, at least respect the dif-
ferences of opinion. 
But this bill doesn’t do that. This bill 
we are going to vote on this week 
doesn’t do that. It gets rid of the high 
protections. It is taxpayer-funded abor-
tions. It also requires taxpayers to sub-
sidize health plans that potentially 
cover elective abortions. 
NATIONAL DEBT 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, now I am 
going to change topics to something 
that is not talked about enough in this 
Congress, and that is spending. We talk 
a lot about these bills and how much 
we are going to spend on this group and 
spend on that group, and we are going 
to give money to this and give money 
to that. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, may I ask 
how much time I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 5 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from West Virginia. 
Mr. MOONEY. Federal debt has in-
creased sharply. I have this beautiful 
chart here starting in 1790, the first 
budget in our country right after the 
Revolutionary War, and you can see 
the national debt. This is done in a fair 
way. It is debt to the gross domestic 
product. So it is a percentage of the do-
mestic product in debt. 
And you can see, in 1790, the mark 
where it was. We just finished the Civil 
War. So we owed some money to the 
soldiers. We paid that off in the next 40 
years up until the Civil War. And in 
the Civil War there was a little bit of 
debt, and it goes back down again. And 
you can see it is kind of steadily up 
and down a bit. World War II, okay. 
World War II, again, debt-to-gross-do-
mestic-product. We were just trying to 
survive there, and the debt is back 
down again. 
But when you get to where we are 
today, things have gone completely out 
of control. The Congressional Budget 
Office estimates an additional $104 tril-
lion will be added by 2050. The Congres-
sional Budget Office forecasted debt 
would rise 200 percent. Today, as I 
stand here right now, we have $27.9 tril-
lion in national debt. 
$27.9 trillion, what is that to you? 
That is $84,000.

February 25, 2021 
That is actually a little more than 
$84,000 of debt to every American cit-
izen right here today. 
Now, on this day 1 year ago, in 2020, 
the U.S. national debt was $23.4 tril-
lion, that was $72,309 in debt per per-
son. We have actually borrowed $10,000 
per person in 1 year. I mean, that is out 
of control. 
And when you hear about these 
bills—I plan to vote against this one 
tomorrow; I think many of us do—they 
say, oh, we are going to give this and 
give that. 
No. They are taking it from you. 
This is debt that your children will 
have to pay. 
This $2 trillion—nearly $2 trillion 
spending package is full of liberal pri-
orities. We are going to grow our debt 
to $29 trillion. That is even more debt 
owed per citizen. 
There is a lot of misinformation 
about where the debt is going. The top 
two countries we owe the debt to are 
China and Japan, not actually our 
friends. We are at global competition 
with China all the time. They are hold-
ing a lot of the debt. We owe China 
over $1 trillion and we owe Japan over 
$1 trillion. 
The people who are loaning us the 
money we have to pay back are not 
necessarily people who have our best 
interest at heart. Brazil, we owe $258 
billion. India, we owe $216 billion. And 
the list goes on the debt that is owed to 
foreign countries. 
The national debt was $5.6 trillion in 
2000. It increased. Under Obama, it ac-
tually doubled. Since the 8 years 
Obama was President, we doubled our 
national debt. And we are adding an-
other—projected 
here—a 
completely 
out of control debt-to-GDP ratio. 
So I urge my colleagues to consider 
the future. Don’t buy into the—the 
government has no money it doesn’t 
take from you that you are going to 
have to pay back. We need to be judi-
cious with these dollars, and most of 
this is not going to coronavirus relief 
anyway. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the gentleman from West Virginia for 
his remarks. And I would echo that— 
and I think the gentleman would 
agree—that I believe that, of the $2 
trillion, only 9 percent is directed to 
COVID relief. 
And I really just can’t believe that 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle can really market this as a 
COVID relief bill when, by the way, we 
have $1 trillion remaining from the $4 
trillion last year and only 9 percent of 
it is directed to COVID. 
Does the gentleman agree? 
Mr. MOONEY. I would agree. And I 
would add that 27 percent of this bill, 
over $510 billion goes to State and local 
governments. So the taxpayers of my 
State of West Virginia and your State 
of Texas and other States are literally 
bailing out States that have failed to 
manage their own budgets. 
West Virginia taxpayers shouldn’t 
have to pay for New York and Illinois 
and California that are completely out 
of control in their spending. $510 billion 
is going to bail out these State and 
local governments. It is not a good use 
of taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would agree 
with the gentleman from West Vir-
ginia, and I appreciate his comments. 
I have 1 minute left and I will simply 
just say this: This chart showing debt 
is not just about the big number. It is 
not just about the $30 trillion of debt. 
This is about tyranny. 
That money, that debt that we owe 
to our kids and grandkids is being used 
to fund an education system that 
teaches our kids that America is evil. 
It is being used to fund an education 
system that won’t even put teachers 
back to work. 
It is being used to fund a DHS that 
won’t secure the border and is turning 
it into a catch-and-release agency. 
It is being used to fund the very in-
stitutions that are coming after our 
precious Bill of Rights. 
And I would just say to the Speaker 
and my friends on the other side of the 
aisle: It is time that we come together 
and protect the rights given to us by 
our Creator, that are reflected and de-
fended in the Constitution of the 
United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on the 
subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, for years, the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus has fought to give 
working families the dignity they de-
serve for the work they perform for our 
communities and our economy. The in-
crease of the minimum wage to $15 an 
hour is an important step to accom-
plish this goal. 
Our caucus is pleased that 14 years 
after Congress last increased the min-
imum wage, we are finally close to see-
ing an increase become law. The Amer-
ican Rescue Plan is intended to help 
those most impacted by the pandemic’s 
financial hardships. The increase in the 
minimum wage will help those most 
vulnerable essential workers. It will 
put money into the economy and into 
our local businesses. It will help jump- 
start our recovery. 
This is also about the dignity of 
work. This is a bill that will grant peo-
ple the dignity of work with a living 
wage. When we don’t provide a living 
minimum wage to American workers, 
they have to work several jobs or rely 
on food stamps or other government 
subsidies to put a roof over their head 
or food on the table. 
Rather than subsidizing corporations 
who pay their workers poverty wage, 
let’s invest in families. Our workers 
put value and love into the work they 
do day in and day out. But Congress 
hasn’t raised the minimum wage in 
over a decade. It is set so low, it is 
unsustainable 
for 
anyone. 
It 
was 
unsustainable before the pandemic, and 
now it is impossible for anyone to sur-
vive off the minimum wage alone. 
If we don’t raise the wage, we will be 
turning our backs on the essential 
workers, on the same workers who 
have been keeping our country running 
for the last year. We will be turning 
our backs on working families. 
Everybody—we hear it all the time— 
is thanking our essential workers. 
Thank you, essential workers. We rec-
ognize now that those who work in our 
grocery stores, who care for our elder-
ly, who pick our foods, who keep our 
schools and hospitals clean are main-
taining our country through this pan-
demic. 
So while we are thanking them, we 
are thanking them for putting their 
lives at stake every time they go to 
work. You know what? That thank you 
is hollow if we don’t back it up with ac-
tion. That thank you is meaningless 
unless we say we are willing to not 
only thank you, but to actually pay 
you a wage that will allow you to live 
and pay your rent and buy your food 
and take care of your children. 
Finally, we are going to put that 
thank you into action. We are going to 
do that tomorrow because tomorrow 
we are going to fulfill our commitment 
to workers and we are going to include 
the minimum wage in the American 
Rescue Plan. 
So let’s not lose sight either of the 
fact that this minimum wage is about 
our values, but it is also about family 
values because this is a bill, the Amer-
ican Rescue Act, that includes the min-
imum wage, that values families. 
b 1945 
And why? Because we have all heard 
the stories of those families, those par-
ents—whether they are a single parent 
or two parents, or two parents and 
their kids—are working. We have all 
heard those stories, that the minimum 
wage we have now set at $7 in many 
places, that that is not enough to pay 
the rent. 
And so what do people need to do? 
They need to take a second job. They 
need to work longer hours. They need 
to do overtime. 
And what happens when you are 
working two jobs or overtime? Do you 
then have time to coach Little League, 
to coach your daughter’s soccer team, 
to spend that extra time reading to 
your kids? The reality is you don’t.

February 25, 2021 
So if we value families, we will pay 
the parents enough so that they have 
enough time to spend with their fami-
lies. 
Mr. Speaker, this is about taking 
families out of poverty. This is about 
taking children out of poverty. And 
this is about allowing them to come 
out of poverty through their employ-
ment. 
Now, there are criticisms out there 
that raising the wage will close busi-
nesses and that people will lose their 
jobs. I am here to tell you from experi-
ence that that won’t happen. We have 
had many economists who have talked 
about the fact that that won’t happen. 
But let me tell you, I have got expe-
rience. Because in 2002, Santa Fe in-
creased the minimum wage. We called 
it back then—and that is why I will 
sometimes fall into saying, ‘‘a living 
wage.’’ We increased the minimum 
wage, and we did it because we wanted 
to help people. We wanted to take the 
first step to bring people out of pov-
erty. 
So the living-wage effort that we did 
in Santa Fe was a broad coalition that 
included businesses, it included grass-
roots activists, it included govern-
ments, it also included the faith com-
munity and the Catholic Church. 
This faith community and the Catho-
lic Church, they saw it as a Christian 
value, that people deserve to earn a liv-
ing wage for their hard work. And the 
first 5 years after passage, not only 
were businesses not harmed, but the 
number of establishments, the number 
of small businesses in Santa Fe grew. 
From 2012 to 2017, both the number of 
small businesses and the number of 
people employed by small businesses in 
Santa Fe increased, all while seeing 
higher wages every single year. Be-
cause what we did in Santa Fe was, we 
said we need to make this decision 
now, and then do what we are doing in 
our bill, which is index it so that we 
don’t have to have this fight all the 
time, and so that we don’t set a min-
imum wage, which is then a poverty 
wage, if we don’t act. 
So in Santa Fe, we did that. And it 
didn’t kill job growth. It didn’t harm 
businesses, but it did help families. It 
helped stimulate our economy. It made 
our communities stronger. It was so 
successful that the county then adopt-
ed a similar living wage. And it was so 
successful in the city and the county 
that the State of New Mexico raised 
the minimum wage as well. 
Here in the House, we will do what 
we did in Santa Fe and New Mexico. We 
will do our job to provide workers 
across the Nation with a wage that re-
flects the hard work that they do for 
us. We will thank them with our legis-
lation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to also urge 
the Senate to lead with the kind of em-
pathy and compassion that our citizens 
and our constituents and our commu-
nities expect of us. And if you lead 
with empathy and compassion, you will 
also pass an American Rescue Plan 
that includes the minimum wage. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be on the 
floor today with my Progressive Cau-
cus colleagues this evening. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Let me start by saying what an 
honor it is to serve with you, and I 
think this is our first action on the 
floor. I am really glad you are here, 
and I appreciate your leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight because 
too many workers across the country 
have not received a raise in far too 
long. They include the frontline and es-
sential workers who have kept our 
economy going during the worst public 
health crisis in nearly a century. These 
workers deserve better pay. That is 
why we must raise the minimum wage, 
step-by-step to $15 an hour by 2025, and 
we have to start doing it right now. 
The Federal minimum wage has been 
stuck at $7.25 an hour for over a dec-
ade. This is the longest stretch of time 
that we have not raised the minimum 
wage since it was first introduced in 
1938. 
Mr. Speaker, $7.25 is far too low. 
That is not an adequate wage for any-
one, regardless of age or occupation. It 
is a poverty wage which prevents work-
ers 
from 
realizing 
the 
American 
Dream. By gradually raising the min-
imum wage to $15 an hour, 27 million 
low-wage workers will get a raise—27 
million people. We will lift nearly a 
million people out of poverty, includ-
ing a lot of kids. And we will put an 
extra $333 billion in the pockets of poor 
and working-class Americans and their 
families over the next decade. 
This money will be a lifeline for the 
working men and women of this coun-
try. It will go towards food. It will go 
towards rent. It will go towards shoes, 
other basic necessities, and that will 
stimulate local economies from coast 
to coast. 
Some detractors say this policy will 
hurt the economy, and that it is too 
much too fast. But that is just plain 
wrong. This proposal raises the min-
imum wage responsibly over a period of 
5 years. Its effective date is 3 months 
after the bill’s enactment, giving em-
ployers adequate time to adjust even 
before the initial increase. 
Mr. Speaker, 20 States just raised 
their minimum wage, going into this 
year, 2021. And a total of 30 States—red 
and blue—now have minimum wages 
higher than the Federal minimum 
wage. That includes my home State of 
Michigan, which raised its minimum 
wage in 2018 and currently has a min-
imum wage of $9.65. So the first in-
crease under this bill won’t even raise 
wages in Michigan. It is very gradual. 
We have not seen the catastrophic 
predictions of job losses and higher 
prices on goods come to pass in States 
that have raised their minimum wage. 
Representative LEGER FERNANDEZ just 
talked about Santa Fe and her county 
and her State, but we have a lot of 
studies showing this to be true from 
coast to coast. 
Indeed, workers have got more pay to 
buy groceries, to pay for prescription 
drugs, to shop on their local Main 
Streets. It is time to make this happen 
for families in every part of the coun-
try. 
Raising the minimum wage to $15 an 
hour is a commonsense policy that 
every Member should support. It is the 
right thing to do morally and prac-
tically for the economy, and I am glad 
that President Biden included it as 
part of his American Rescue Plan. 
Now, let me talk about how the 
American people feel about this. If 
Congressional Republicans want to op-
pose this, they are really out of sync 
with many of their own voters. 
According to a recent poll from Data 
for Progress, 66 percent of voters sup-
port increasing the Federal minimum 
wage to $15 an hour. In addition, 57 per-
cent of voters support using non-
standard Senate procedures, like the 
budget reconciliation, to pass this min-
imum wage increase. 
Mr. Speaker, 20 States just raised 
their minimum wage, as I said, in the 
last year, but let’s focus on Florida. 
In November of 2020, Florida voted 
for Donald Trump—I am not positive of 
my data here. I think it was by 50.5 
percent to 48 percent, I think President 
Trump won Florida. Well, guess what? 
A $15-an-hour minimum wage clocked 
Donald Trump. The same Republican 
voters and Democratic voters and Inde-
pendent voters all across Florida who 
voted for Donald Trump by a slight 
margin, voted for a $15-an-hour State- 
wide minimum wage by 61 to 39 per-
cent. It was overwhelming. 
In the midst of a pandemic that has 
killed 500,000 Americans and an eco-
nomic crisis that has the worst food 
lines in unemployment since the Great 
Depression, corporations have been 
raking in billions while workers are 
earning poverty wages and they are 
forced to live off food stamps. That is 
why so many Americans support this. 
Now, what about the argument that 
$15 an hour is too high? 
By 2025, $15 an hour will be the equiv-
alent of $13.62 in 2020 dollars. So it 
won’t even be as high as it appears 
now, but it will be the minimum 
amount that a single adult working 
full time will need to earn a living and 
to cover core basic living expenses. 
Now, check this out: Even in the area 
with the lowest cost of living in these 
United States, Beckley, West Virginia, 
in 2025, a two-parent, two-child house-
hold, in which both parents earn $15 an 
hour and pay taxes, will be $360 short 
each month to cover basic living ex-
penses. The lowest-cost place in the 
country, $15 an hour in 2025 won’t fully 
cover basic living expenses. 
Furthermore, if the minimum wage 
had kept pace with productivity, with 
the increased productivity we create by 
working, since 1968—so productivity 
gains from 1968 to today—if the min-
imum wage had increased at the same

rate, it would be over $20 an hour 
today. And we are proposing just $15 an 
hour. 
So, 
Representative 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ, I am so grateful for you 
bringing me into this conversation. I 
feel like this is a question of basic de-
cency, of basic dignity, of the value of 
work in this country. Every person who 
gets up and goes to work should be able 
to provide for their family. And every 
person, just as you said, should have 
one job, and that should be enough. 
One job should be enough. And by the 
way, that includes everybody. 
One of the great things about what 
we are doing is, we are getting rid of 
subminimum wages across the board. 
No subminimums for tip workers, who 
are overwhelmingly women and work-
ers of color, no subminimum wages for 
workers with a disability. 
We have an opportunity here to bring 
so many people out of poverty, to give 
a raise to 27 million people. It is time 
to do this. We have got to pass it. The 
Senate has got to pass it. We have a 
President named Joseph R. Biden, who 
is ready to sign it. Let’s go. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Congress-
man LEVIN, I think you raised exactly 
the points that we have been talking 
about. 
This minimum wage, it should be a 
floor. And it is something that every-
body supports. Everybody supports it, 
whether you are a Republican, whether 
you are a Democrat, and it is time to 
get it done. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
let me just mention, the gentlewoman 
is so right that it is a floor. One of 
these arguments that we hear is, ‘‘We 
don’t want one-size-fits-all,’’ right? 
Well, first of all, as a labor lawyer, 
the minimum wage has been one na-
tional wage the whole time since 1938. 
It is simply a floor of decency. 
And guess what? You already ex-
plained how in 2025, it is not very like-
ly that the minimum wage in Santa 
Fe, New Mexico, will be $15 an hour. 
Because in Santa Fe and San Francisco 
and Los Angeles and New York and 
Denver—and 
whatever—places 
all 
around this country—the odds are 
overwhelming that they will have to 
raise their minimum wage beyond that. 
It is a floor of decency. Let’s go. 
Don’t you think? Let’s go. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Congress-
man LEVIN, I love the way you describe 
this as a ‘‘floor of decency.’’ And it is 
our moral compass that tells us that 
we must vote for this and we must vote 
for families now. And so we have heard 
what is happening in your State. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
ADAMS), so she can explain why this is 
supported in her district and her State. 
b 2000 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative LEGER FERNANDEZ for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to give 
voice to the millions of Americans who 
are calling on us to raise the wage. 
Our minimum wage workers, many of 
whom we have come to call essential 
workers, have a base pay of $15,080 a 
year. It doesn’t take a Ph.D. to know 
that you can’t survive on $7.25. Yet, we 
expect millions of our neighbors to do 
it, even during a pandemic and an eco-
nomic crisis. 
From the North Carolina General As-
sembly to the U.S. House of Represent-
atives, raising the wage has been part 
of my life’s work. I know how a couple 
of dollars an hour can be the difference 
between prosperity and poverty. I 
know it because I have lived it. You 
see, my mom was a domestic worker. 
She cleaned other people’s houses so I 
wouldn’t have to, so I could focus on 
going to school and getting a good edu-
cation. Day in and day out, I saw that 
no matter how hard she worked, her 
earnings were barely enough to get us 
by. 
Colleagues, this is not because she 
didn’t work hard enough. It is because 
she didn’t make enough. 
Now, decades later, that reality has 
only gotten starker and the need to ad-
dress it more pressing. The minimum 
wage has been at $7.25 for over a dec-
ade, the longest stretch in U.S. history. 
Mr. Speaker, it is simply impossible 
to pay the rent and feed your family 
when you are only making $1,250 a 
month. That is not far off from the av-
erage monthly rent of an apartment in 
Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Make no mistake about it, $7.25 is a 
poverty wage. That is why it is time to 
raise the wage to $15 an hour. 
A $15 minimum wage would give 27 
million low-wage workers a raise and 
lift nearly 1 million people out of pov-
erty. In my district, in Charlotte and 
Mecklenburg County, it would mean 
giving a raise to 80,000 working women. 
146,000 workers in the 12th District 
would see an average pay increase of 
over $4,000 a year. 
In this moment of crisis, as we grap-
ple with the COVID–19 pandemic, a $15 
minimum wage is more important than 
ever. 
It is also important to note that es-
sential and frontline workers make up 
a majority of those who would benefit 
from this wage increase. I believe in es-
sential wages for essential workers. 
That is why we can’t pay an essential 
worker or any worker a poverty wage. 
We must take action to deliver on 
our Nation’s promise of equal oppor-
tunity for all. In the strongest possible 
terms, I urge support for increasing the 
Federal minimum wage to $15. If it 
can’t happen in tomorrow’s package, I 
urge our committee and this body to 
take it up next week because America 
cannot wait. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Congress-
woman ADAMS, that was such a forceful 
description of why it is so necessary for 
us to act, to act on this moral impera-
tive, which we are facing in this mo-
ment. 
We have to remember this is a his-
toric moment, so this is our time to 
take historic action. When we say 
thank you to those essential workers, 
we must express our gratitude in 
things like the minimum wage because 
without that, then they are just words. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, the gentle-
woman is exactly right. We have to do 
it, and we have to do it now. 
Essential workers need essential op-
portunities to get a decent wage so 
that they can take care of their fami-
lies. Working hard is not enough if you 
don’t make enough. Right now, folks 
who are making this $7.25 do not make 
enough to make ends meet. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Working 
hard enough is not enough if you can’t 
make ends meet. Those are wonderful 
words. 
Ms. ADAMS. That is right. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to my colleague from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good colleague from New Mexico. It is 
truly an honor to be able to serve with 
her. 
Yesterday, she shared with me a 
young student in her district sent her a 
beautiful letter. It was her first letter 
from a young child in her district, and 
I lovingly called the child Teresa’s 
truth-teller. I hope it starts a trend in 
her community. 
Mr. Speaker, to many of my col-
leagues here, I ask them all to please 
come and tour my district. I lovingly 
call them 13th District Strong because 
they never stop fighting for justice 
even when many here across the coun-
try are always being asked to wait: 
wait for this, wait for change, wait for 
us to be able to tackle poverty wages. 
Those that can afford it, they wait, but 
our folks can’t afford it anymore. 
Raising the Federal minimum wage 
to $15 per hour has never been more ur-
gent for my residents, and it is long 
overdue. You see, I represent the third 
poorest congressional district in the 
country. I want you to think about 
that for one moment. 
I have an elderly couple who has to 
melt snow in a bucket so that they 
have the ability to flush their toilet be-
cause they can’t afford water. Water 
has been increased by 400 percent in 
rates. I have a mother in my district 
who is pleading for me to find a place 
where her daughter can eat twice a 
day. More than half of my residents 
pay a third or more of their income for 
housing. 
Our economy is structured in a way 
to benefit the few over the many. It is 
no surprise that the many it is not 
working for are the working people in 
our communities. 
If we want to truly look and peek at 
the economy, measure the amount of 
debt our families have compared to 
their incomes. Look at the produc-
tivity numbers that are up compared 
to the wages that remain stagnant. 
At the same time that our people are 
suffering, large corporations are seeing 
record-breaking profits, and CEOs are 
being paid record-high salaries. It is 
simply unfair and immoral.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H713 
February 25, 2021 
Raising the minimum wage is also a 
matter of racial justice. Workers of 
color are far more likely to be paid 
poverty wages than their White coun-
terparts, and Black and Brown workers 
are far more likely to be victims of 
wage theft. I know because I used to 
represent them and fight for their fair 
access to their wages that they have 
earned. 
A $15 Federal minimum wage would 
increase the earnings of 38 percent of 
Black workers across our Nation, a 
raise that will be life-changing. 
It is time for all of us right here in 
Congress to earn our own pay and de-
liver this overdue minimum wage in-
crease without delay. I hope folks un-
derstand, $15 is already the com-
promise. It is. If the minimum wage 
had kept up with worker productivity, 
it would already be at $24 per hour. 
Workers aren’t asking for anything 
they aren’t already earning for their 
bosses. Without workers, there is no 
profit. It is high time for us to end the 
pattern of exploiting workers, our 
neighbors, family members. 
Raise the wage. It is the right thing 
to do for our Nation. It is so incredibly 
supported outside these Halls of Con-
gress. Listen to the people who sent us 
here. They are urging us to please stop 
waiting. 
We have been given the power to 
change their lives for the better. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank, again, my colleague 
from New Mexico. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, Congresswoman TLAIB talked 
about the fact that now is the time. 
There is a call and an urgency for us to 
do this because it is the time of the 
pandemic. It is the time of such great 
suffering. 
My father had a saying that when it 
was time to get important stuff done, 
he would say, ‘‘Ahora es cuando,’’ it is 
time 
now. 
His 
saying 
is 
ringing 
through your words, and it is calling 
upon us to say what we need to say so 
that we do what we need to do and 
raise the wage. So, ahora es cuando. It 
is, indeed, time now. 
Thank you for explaining the ur-
gency of what it is like to have to boil 
your water because you can’t afford 
the utility bill. That should break all 
of our hearts, and it should urge us 
each to act and to act now with the 
power that we have been given by our 
constituents. 
I would now like to turn to one of my 
colleagues, one of our freshman class 
from New York City, Congressman 
TORRES. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Teresa for those kind 
words. 
I have the honor of representing New 
York 15, the South Bronx, which is 
often said to be the poorest congres-
sional district in America. The unem-
ployment rate in the South Bronx can 
be as high as 25 percent compared to 5 
percent in the Upper East Side, so we 
are living through a tale of two cities. 
But COVID–19 has shown the South 
Bronx to be the essential congressional 
district. It is the home of essential 
workers who put their lives at risk dur-
ing the peak of the pandemic so that 
the rest of us could safely shelter in 
place. We owe it to those workers to 
give them a fighting chance at a decent 
and dignified life. 
Our society will be judged by how we 
treat the most essential among us. 
There is a gap between the value of 
what our essential workers do and how 
poorly we treat them and how poorly 
we pay them. Bridging that essential 
gap is one of the great moral impera-
tives of our time. 
Raising the minimum wage is long 
overdue. The minimum wage in Amer-
ica has been lagging behind inflation. 
It has been lagging behind the produc-
tivity of the American workforce. It 
has been lagging behind the historic 
average. 
We have gone more than a decade, 
the longest we have ever gone, without 
raising the minimum wage by even a 
cent. By every metric, whether it is in-
flation or productivity or the historic 
average or the length of time that we 
have gone without raising the min-
imum wage, it is time to finally lift 
the minimum wage for the most essen-
tial workers among us. 
The statistics are clear that raising 
the minimum wage would lift 900,000 
Americans out of poverty. It would 
raise incomes for 17,000 Americans. 
For me, the minimum wage is ex-
actly that. It is the minimum of what 
we should do for our most essential 
workers. If we fail to raise the min-
imum wage, then shame on us. Shame 
on us for failing to do right by the es-
sential workers who did right by all of 
us in our moment of greatest need. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Congressman TORRES. 
What he has told us today is about 
the fact that there are districts in the 
country, including mine, including so 
many that we have heard about, where 
the minimum wage is too low. What we 
can’t do is we can’t have a United 
States of America where what you earn 
depends on where you live. That is 
what we are trying to do today, is say 
that where you live does not impact 
what you earn or where you work. 
Today, at a Senate hearing, Costco 
announced that it would begin paying 
their workers a $16-an-hour minimum 
wage. They have already recognized 
that that $15 level is too low, and they 
want to keep their workers. 
The reality is, we know that when 
people are paid well, then the turnover 
is less. The commitment is better, and 
paying a minimum wage, paying some-
thing where somebody can go home to 
their children, can put that food on the 
table without relying on SNAP bene-
fits, that they can then say: I have 
done it. I can go work. I can come 
home. 
And it doesn’t matter whether I live 
in your district, whether I live in Se-
attle, or whether I live in Coronado. It 
doesn’t matter because there is a floor 
that is the same across the country, 
and it is not a poverty wage. 
b 2015 
What we have now is a poverty wage. 
That is very clear. If you cannot use 
the minimum wage that we have now 
to pay your rent, to buy your food, and 
to pay your utilities, then that is the 
equivalent of a poverty wage. We know 
that. We know that because of the 
wages we have across our country. 
We have all worked. Congressman 
TORRES, you have worked and looked 
to see: When does the Community De-
velopment Block Grant come in? Does 
it look like we are a distressed commu-
nity or not? They look at what that 
median income is, and if you are earn-
ing the median wage, you are in pov-
erty, right? 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, she is exactly right. The 
promise of America is that if you work 
hard and play by the rules, then you 
should have access to a decent, dig-
nified life. Too many of our essential 
workers are paid starvation wages. 
You have people who are doing every-
thing right. They are working their 
heart out for the country and for their 
families, and they are struggling to 
survive because the cost of living in 
America, especially in cities like New 
York, is spiraling out of control. 
So the promise of America is broken 
as long as we continue to pay our most 
essential workers poverty wages. It is 
no longer defensible. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, earlier we spoke about the 
fact that to say thank you to these es-
sential workers regularly and over and 
over again but to refuse to pay a living 
wage, a minimum wage of at least what 
we are asking for in this bill, is really 
not saying thank you at all, is it? It 
rings hollow. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, we cannot simply honor our 
essential workers with hollow words. 
We, as a country, have to put our 
money where our mouth is and do right 
by them. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of raising the federal minimum wage 
to $15 an hour. I want to thank my friend and 
colleague 
Representative 
Teresa 
Leger 
Fernandez from New Mexico’s 3rd district for 
convening this special order hour. Raising the 
federal minimum wage to $15 an hour is one 
critical step towards ensuring an equitable re-
covery from the COVID–19 pandemic. The 
federal minimum wage has been at $7.25 for 
more than a decade. This is the longest period 
of time without an increase in the minimum 
wage in US history. Inflation has eroded this 
amount to a fraction of its previous value. We 
must increase the wage and we must do it 
now. 
Someone working a full time job at the cur-
rent 
federal 
minimum 
wage 
only 
earns 
$15,000 a year. That is a disgrace. A full time 
worker in this country should be able to put

food on their table and a roof over their head 
and be able to pay their other expenses with 
their earnings. Many of these minimum wage 
workers are essential workers, helping our 
communities endure this pandemic. 
Raising the minimum wage to fifteen dollars 
an hour isn’t a cure-all. In high cost urban 
areas, such as the one I represent in the Bay 
Area, fifteen dollars an hour still is not enough 
to get ahead. But raising the federal minimum 
wage has been shown to help lift wages 
across the board for people at the lower end 
of the income scale. 
A fifteen dollar minimum wage would give 
27 million low-wage workers a raise and lift 
nearly one MILLION people out of poverty. But 
this isn’t just an economic need—it’s a racial 
justice imperative. Many people of color have 
been paid poverty wages for too long—deep-
ening the long standing racial and economic 
divisions in this country. African Americans, 
Hispanics and Asian Americans are all much 
more likely to make only the minimum wage. 
Recent polling shows that 72 percent of 
Americans, a vast majority, support raising the 
minimum wage, including Republicans and 
Independents. We need to ensure workers get 
paid living wages, especially in times of crisis. 
Raising the minimum wage is a necessary first 
step to growing our economy and recovering 
from this pandemic. Additionally, it will also 
lessen the need for full time workers to be re-
ceiving public assistance. When you raise the 
wages of the lowest-paid workers, it is good 
for our communities and our country. Those 
workers can then spend money in their com-
munities, boosting local small businesses and 
our entire economy. 
f 
HONORING HOMETOWN HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CAMMACK) for 30 minutes. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate and honor home-
town heroes in my district and across 
the Nation, these proud Americans em-
bodying the persistent, giving, and 
fighting spirit of our national creed. 
The COVID pandemic has put our 
country and our communities to the 
test, pushing us to seek positivity and 
hope in each day as we have weathered 
the storms that have come our way. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight the 
great work and service of my constitu-
ents who have shown bravery and em-
pathy in these trying times. 
Last week, I invited the constituents 
of Florida’s Third Congressional Dis-
trict, the Gator Nation, to submit their 
nominations for individuals they would 
like to honor for their dedication to 
our communities over the last year. I 
received several nominations with the 
names of constituents who have gone 
above and beyond the call of duty, who 
put service above self, so many nomi-
nations, in fact, that we have pledged 
to continue this series throughout the 
year to highlight their great work. 
Included in this group are first re-
sponders, law enforcement officers, 
teachers, nurses, and Good Samaritans. 
They are the backbone of our commu-
nities. I am honored to be able to rep-
resent them in Congress and share 
their stories with you today. 
The first is my friend, and the only 
woman sheriff in the great State of 
Florida, Sheriff Michelle Cook. Sheriff 
Cook, in her long tenure in law en-
forcement, has walked the beat and 
fought against the scourge of the 
opioid epidemic and human trafficking 
in Clay County. 
She is also the proud mother to four 
foster 
children, 
who 
she 
lovingly 
brought into her own home to prevent 
their separation. She works every day 
to protect our community and our 
great county of Clay County. I am so 
grateful for her service. 
Thank you, Sheriff Cook. 
Now, much like Sheriff Cook, Ser-
geant Kim Miller put service above self 
as a member of the Green Cove Springs 
Police Department. While Sergeant 
Miller celebrated her retirement ear-
lier this year, she has spent the last 15 
years of her life dedicated to the chil-
dren of Clay County and their safety 
and development. 
She is proud to have been the first 
Black female sergeant for the Green 
Cove Springs Police Department and 
continues to make the citizens of Clay 
County proud. 
It was always a pleasure seeing Ser-
geant Miller’s smiling face when I vis-
ited the department, and I congratu-
late her on her retirement this year. 
Although she is not on the force any 
longer, her service to the Green Cove 
Springs community is remarkable. I 
am honored to celebrate her here 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. CARL). 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, what an 
honor to get to speak before you. This 
is a thrill. 
I rise today to honor several home-
town heroes from my district who have 
made an impact on the community 
over the course of the year. 
First, I would like to thank my col-
league from Florida, Congresswoman 
KAT CAMMACK, for organizing this Spe-
cial Order hour. 
I also reached out to my community, 
and I asked for the leaders in our com-
munity to give us some of what they 
think to be hometown heroes. Let me 
just run through a few real quick. 
Last year has been tough on millions 
of Americans across the country as we 
battle the COVID pandemic and endure 
countless hardships, but I am proud of 
so many folks in south Alabama who 
have made our community a better 
place. Many of them are unsung heroes. 
I would like to take a moment today to 
honor a few of them. 
Brian Copes, manufacturing instruc-
tor for the city of Chickasaw School 
System, is a leader in the effort of de-
veloping inexpensive prosthetic limbs 
that will change many lives of ampu-
tees throughout Latin America. 
Students from all disciplines have 
been working together to create a real 
nonprofit business. Eventually, these 
students will travel to Latin America, 
not only to fit the amputees but also to 
aid the amputees in rehabilitation as 
they learn to walk and use their new 
limbs. 
Another one is Natalie Fox, assistant 
administrator and chief nursing officer 
for 
USA 
Physicians 
Group. 
That 
‘‘USA’’ stands for University of South 
Alabama, which we are very proud of. 
And USA Healthcare has been a leading 
coordinator in the University of South 
Alabama Healthcare System commu-
nity testing and vaccination sites for 
the Mobile region. 
To date, she has overseen the suc-
cessful implementation of over 26,000 
COVID–19 vaccines administered since 
December 
15, 
and 
over 
50,000 
coronavirus tests performed since the 
pandemic began. Natalie has worked 
tirelessly to meet the high demands on 
the healthcare system for the past 
year, and I am incredibly thankful for 
her hard work and her dedication to 
the people of south Alabama. 
Jennifer Myrick of Fairhope, Ala-
bama, has been a critical figure in the 
recovery efforts after Hurricanes Sally 
and Zeta, which hit the area. Jennifer 
worked through the Fairhope United 
Methodist Church to set up an inde-
pendent point of distribution to hand 
out critical supplies to the public. 
She has also headed up a feeding pro-
gram for those supplies and is an active 
member of the Voluntary Organiza-
tions Active in Disaster through Bald-
win County Emergency Management, 
where she helped fulfill many needs 
throughout the county. 
Jennifer 
also 
worked 
with 
the 
Fairhope Police Department to keep 
police officers, dispatchers, and correc-
tion officers fed through this long 
stretch between both of these hurri-
canes. 
Kathy Couey, a recreation supervisor 
for the city of Chickasaw, Alabama, 
goes above and beyond her duties every 
day in her day-to-day responsibilities 
to make sure the city is a better and 
healthier place for families to live. Her 
creativity is limitless, with a true serv-
ant’s heart. 
With so many people working and 
learning from home over the past year, 
staying active and getting outdoors 
has been critical to people’s physical 
and mental health. Kathy’s hard work 
has made Chickasaw a better place to 
live and raise a family. 
Virtually no person across the coun-
try has not been impacted in some way 
by the pandemic, natural disasters, and 
the countless other challenges that we 
have faced. We have come a long way. 
Although we are living in difficult 
times, I could not be prouder than I am 
to be an American today. 
And I couldn’t be more thankful for 
so many incredible people all over my 
district and all over the Nation who 
have worked hard each day, not for 
fame, not for recognition or for money, 
but for the betterment of their friends 
and neighbors. This is what makes 
America strong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H715 
February 25, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the op-
portunity to take a moment today to 
recognize just a few of those unsung 
heroes who have made an impact in our 
community over the past year. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Alabama. 
Even though, the SEC Nation, we may 
be rivals on game day, when it comes 
to honoring our hometown heroes, we 
are united, and I appreciate you taking 
the time to share these stories. 
Mr. Speaker, before I yield to an-
other one of my great colleagues, I 
want to highlight a great man, Mr. 
Mike Leader, from Fleming Island, 
Florida, who is an active duty physi-
cian proudly serving in the United 
States Navy. 
Mike was deployed in April 2020 to 
fight the COVID–19 pandemic, and he 
has been working tirelessly to save 
lives over the last year. His wife, 
Adriane, and his three children have 
remained strong and positive during 
his time away from home, recognizing 
his sacrifice for our fellow Americans. 
Mike is set to be deployed again next 
month to once again take up the fight 
against this pandemic, and he and his 
family will be in my thoughts and 
prayers as he continues the fight to 
end COVID–19. 
I would also like to honor Orange 
Park native Peggie French. Ms. French 
is what her nominators call an angel to 
seniors. Ms. French spends hours every 
single week scheduling vaccines for 
seniors in Clay County. She has be-
come somewhat of an expert in the 
process and even helps to monitor the 
vaccine sites for cancelations to help 
seniors trying to get appointments. 
To date, she has helped over 60 senior 
citizens to get appointments for the 
COVID–19 vaccine in her spare time. I 
visited the COVID vaccination sites in 
my district a few weeks ago, where 
these very seniors that she helped were 
being vaccinated. I want to thank 
Peggie and those just like her for help-
ing folks in our area. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
first, I would like to thank Representa-
tive CAMMACK for bringing this idea of 
honoring our hometown heroes to the 
floor. It is long overdue. 
There are so many who have made an 
impact in our communities over the 
last year. When I think of the count-
less hours our healthcare workers have 
dedicated, their time spent away from 
family to take care of others, the doc-
tors, nurses, and first responders, we 
can never fully thank them for their 
dedication to our country during this 
difficult time. 
But as my team and I discussed who 
from Oklahoma’s Fifth District has 
helped this community survive the 
pandemic, who worked on the ground 
with people in need, one name was 
mentioned over and over, and that was 
Pastor Derrick Scobey of Ebenezer 
Baptist Church in Oklahoma City. 
He and his band of volunteers have 
worked countless hours to make sure 
Oklahomans everywhere were fed, not 
just in the surrounding community but 
in towns and cities across the great 
State of Oklahoma. In partnership with 
the World Vision Organization, Pastor 
Scobey distributed more than 91,000 
boxes of fresh food in the past year. 
That is 2.3 million pounds of food hand- 
delivered by Ebenezer Baptist Church 
and his countless volunteers through-
out the State. 
b 2030 
My team and I had the pleasure of as-
sisting Pastor Scobey with a few of his 
distribution events in Oklahoma City. I 
was overwhelmed with the gratitude on 
the faces of those who were receiving 
these food boxes. 
This man right here is truly making 
a difference to those in need. He has 
been on the ground day in and day out 
making sure that more than 150,000 
Oklahomans did not go hungry during 
this pandemic. 
In addition to food, he made sure 
that those needing furnishings did not 
go without. His group distributed 2,300 
pallets of furniture to the underserved 
as well. It is a monumental task that 
Pastor Scobey took on, but he saw the 
need in his community. He heard from 
pastors and communities from across 
the State with similar needs, rolled up 
his sleeves, and he got to work. 
This Nation needs more pastors like 
Derrick Scobey, who aren’t afraid of 
the hard work of feeding our commu-
nities not just with the word of God on 
Sunday morning, but with hours of 
heavy lifting, sweating in the heat of 
the summer, or trying to stay warm in 
the subzero temperatures, all to make 
sure those who were hungry have some-
thing to eat. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Pastor 
Scobey for being a hero to Oklahomans 
from every corner of the great State of 
Oklahoma. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from the great 
State of Oklahoma. It has been an 
honor so far serving with her in this 
Congress, and I expect that we will be 
hearing many more stories of great 
Oklahomans who are doing incredible 
work in our communities. 
Mr. Speaker, at this time I would 
like to honor a gentleman who is much 
like my husband, a hero and a fire-
fighter. Justin Dean serves the Orange 
Park Fire Department and its city 
both in his capacity as a firefighter and 
as a heroic private citizen. Mr. Dean 
was driving home one afternoon re-
cently when he noticed a car parked on 
the side of the bridge near Doctor’s 
Lake. He pulled his vehicle over, pro-
ceeded to talk to the woman standing 
at the top of the bridge, and he offered 
her a hug. When she accepted, Fire-
fighter Dean jumped into action and 
pulled her tightly over the rail to safe-
ty. He was awarded a meritorious 
award for his brave, lifesaving action. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Justin. 
Mr. Speaker, Rhonda Wilson is a hero 
from my hometown of Gainesville, 
Florida. She wears many hats in our 
community. She is a middle school 
teacher, a thespian, a theater director, 
and a philanthropist. She founded the 
Star Center Theatre nearly two dec-
ades ago and, in the years since, has 
provided an opportunity for local chil-
dren and families to perform and enjoy 
fine arts. 
A portion of all the theatre’s pro-
ceeds go to Created Gainesville, a non-
profit committed to reaching and re-
storing women caught in sex traf-
ficking and sexual exploitation in 
Gainesville. Rhonda’s work is espe-
cially impactful to me, as I have 
worked to eliminate human trafficking 
from our District and our State. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DONALDS). 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida, my good friend, Congresswoman 
CAMMACK, for bringing this great idea 
to the House Chamber to honor those 
of us in our communities who have 
done, frankly, more than Members of 
Congress actually have. The sacrifices 
that they have made not only in our 
communities 
but 
throughout 
their 
lives is really something to honor, it is 
something to behold, and it is some-
thing to cherish. I am just grateful for 
this opportunity to do this on the peo-
ples’ floor this evening. 
The first hometown hero I wish to 
honor is Captain Wayne Ogden Smith. 
Today, we pay tribute to one of Naples’ 
hometown heroes. Mr. SMITH
was a 
United States Air Force fighter pilot 
and a Vietnam prisoner of war. Captain 
Smith was a prisoner of war at the 
Hanoi Hilton for 5 years, alongside 
Senator Sam Johnson and Senator 
John McCain. However, he would never 
call himself a hometown hero. 
Wayne was a 1965 graduate of the 
United States Air Force Academy and 
would fly 90 F–4 fighter combat mis-
sions over North Vietnam and Laos. 
Captain Smith was shot down on Janu-
ary 18, 1968, at the age of 24. He sur-
vived 5 years and 2 months and was re-
patriated on March 15, 1973. 
Wayne’s combat honors include two 
Silver Stars, the Legion of Merit, two 
Distinguished 
Flying 
Crosses, 
two 
Bronze ‘‘V’’ Stars, seven Air Medals, 
and the Purple Heart. 
Now retired from the business world, 
Wayne Smith spends his time with his 
wife helping veterans and active mili-
tary around the country through orga-
nizations like Wreaths Across America 
and Naples Spirit of ‘45, a celebration 
honoring our World War II veterans 
and beyond. 
Mr. Speaker, another hometown hero 
from my District is Allison Dawson. 
Allison has proudly dedicated her life 
to educating our youth. Allison’s ca-
reer in youth education spans over 30 
years, almost 20 of those in Lee Coun-
ty, Florida. 
A single mom who raised three kids, 
she struggled to pay bills and struggled 
to put food on the table. Despite these 
obstacles, Allison remained committed

to her passion and her life’s work: 
teaching and helping low-income stu-
dents learn and grow to succeed. 
During COVID–19, like thousands of 
teachers across our Nation, she juggled 
virtual school and in-person instruc-
tion flawlessly, all to ensure her stu-
dents received the very best education. 
She is a prime example of how hard all 
teachers across America work every 
single day. 
I am honored to recognize Allison 
Dawson today as a teacher and as a 
public servant. I thank Allison for her 
30 years of service; her commitment to 
serving others; and ensuring that every 
child, no matter their race, gender and 
socioeconomic background, has access 
to a world-class education. 
Mr. Speaker, my last hometown hero 
is Major Jose Martinez, BSN, RN. Jose 
Martinez, BSN and RN, is the nursing 
director of adult and pediatric emer-
gency department at North Naples Hos-
pital in southwest Florida. He has been 
a nurse for 22 years, and 13 of them at 
NCH. 
Major Jose Martinez has a 19-year 
military career. He has served 9 years 
with the Army National Guard and 10 
years with the Air Force Reserve. 
Major Martinez is currently a flight 
nurse instructor and clinical manage-
ment flight commander in the 45th 
Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron at 
MacDill Air Force Base in Florida. 
Major Martinez just returned from a 6- 
month deployment at duty station 
Travis Air Force Base in California. 
Major Martinez coordinated more than 
50 Aeromedical Evacuation Westpac/ 
Cross Country Aeromedical missions 
with more than 400 aeromedical evacu-
ation crew, critical care crew, and neo-
natal critical care members serving 
more than 100 patients who represent 
our U.S. military and their families. 
He has dedicated his life to serving 
others and has saved countless lives. I 
am honored to recognize Major Mar-
tinez today and his sacrifices for our 
Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, there are many heroes 
in all of our communities. These are 
just three who happen to live in my 
congressional district, and it is my 
honor to honor them this evening. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, as a 
fellow Floridian, I look forward to get-
ting to know the gentleman’s home-
town heroes at some point in the near 
future. I thank the gentleman for join-
ing me here on the floor of the people’s 
House to honor the hometown heroes 
who make up the great State of Flor-
ida. 
Last, but certainly not least, I would 
like to recognize my friend and the 
great sheriff of Marion County, Sheriff 
Billy Woods. I have known Billy for 
nearly a decade, and in that time, I 
have seen his passion for helping peo-
ple. I am proud to have worked with 
Sheriff Woods on combating human 
trafficking in the State of Florida, as 
well as taking on criminal drug traf-
fickers and supporting the rights of 
lawful gun owners. I am also proud to 
recognize his tireless efforts tonight to 
protect and serve our ever-growing 
community in Marion County. I know 
Billy to be a man of integrity, grit, and 
honesty. He is a tremendous defender 
of freedom and security, and I am 
proud 
to 
call 
him 
and 
his 
wife, 
Samantha, dear friends. 
I am deeply grateful for all of the 
people who have spoken here today. 
Their work and their efforts to make 
my district and its many communities 
a better place to live and raise a family 
do not go unnoticed. They make me 
proud to be an American and the Rep-
resentative from Florida’s Third Con-
gressional District. I chose to celebrate 
these hometown heroes today to honor 
their work and celebrate their passion 
for helping others. I challenge my con-
stituents and all Americans to take 
stock of the everyday heroes all around 
us and thank them for what they do. 
Whether it is working as a frontline 
healthcare worker in a local clinic, a 
law 
enforcement 
officer 
supporting 
children, librarians assisting students 
with virtual learning, or a delivery 
worker ensuring that we all get our 
critical packages on time, they are 
all—and there are so many more out 
there—extraordinary Americans who 
continue to put duty above all else. 
I thank the nominees and the nomi-
nators of today’s heroes. Again, I look 
forward to continuing this yearlong se-
ries of honoring our hometown heroes, 
and I look forward to hearing more of 
my 
colleagues’ 
stories 
from 
their 
hometown heroes. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the op-
portunity here tonight to honor these 
heroes, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
f 
HOMETOWN HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
SLOTKIN) for 30 minutes. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Olivia Letts, who 
passed away on February 1 at the age 
of 93. Ms. Letts was a true trailblazer. 
After being hired as the first Black 
schoolteacher in Lansing, she was a 
constant force for good in the commu-
nity. It is my privilege to honor her 
with my remarks on the floor of the 
people’s House. 
Born on the south side of Chicago, 
Ms. Letts did not let anything get in 
the way of her own education. Accord-
ing to her grandsons, the only time she 
was ever late for school was because of 
a trolley accident. 
At the rooming house that she and 
her family shared with other families, 
she would wake up as early as 4 a.m. to 
study in the bathroom because it was 
the only time she could find peace and 
quiet. 
She 
maintained 
her 
devotion 
to 
learning during her time at the Chi-
cago Teachers College and her three 
advanced degree programs at Michigan 
State University. Nothing could keep 
Ms. Letts from the classroom, not even 
the racial discrimination of the day. 
To be sure, breaking the color barrier 
in Lansing schools wasn’t easy. The 
first time she applied to be a teacher, 
she was rejected with a letter that said 
the district ‘‘had never made a practice 
of hiring anyone of her race, but would 
keep 
her 
under 
consideration.’’ 
Undeterred, Ms. Letts lobbied local 
leaders until she was asked to reapply. 
Ten years later, she was promoted to 
principal. 
Ms. Letts’ story wouldn’t be com-
plete without mention of her husband 
and lifelong love, Richard, who passed 
away in 1997. For nearly half a century, 
their union was an unstoppable force 
for good in Lansing—she as the con-
summate advocate and role model for 
students and he as the city’s equal op-
portunity officer and human relations 
director for 44 years. They are the 
namesake of the Letts Community 
Center, where this photo was taken. 
Ms. Letts was an eternal optimist. 
She liked books with happy endings, 
whether they were Nicholas Sparks 
novels or President Obama’s memoirs. 
She lived a full life, and her story 
had a happy ending, too. Just a few 
days before her passing, she parked 
herself in front of the television, 
thrilled to watch her fellow Alpha 
Kappa Alpha sister, KAMALA HARRIS, be 
inaugurated as Vice President. 
She is survived by her daughter, Ei-
leen; her two grandsons, Robert and 
Matthew; as well as the countless indi-
viduals she touched with her grace and 
humility. 
Since her passing, the tributes to her 
life have been effusive: 
‘‘She was just delightful.’’ 
‘‘She helped pave the way.’’ 
‘‘She just did what was right.’’ 
And my personal favorite, ‘‘Her leg-
acy lives on in the work that folks are 
doing here in the community.’’ 
What a fitting way to remember such 
a towering figure of the Lansing com-
munity. May she indeed live on in the 
work and in these words spoken into 
the permanent RECORD of the people’s 
House.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF JAMES BIBBS 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor another legend in the 
Lansing community, Mr. James Bibbs. 
Mr. Bibbs has had many words writ-
ten about him over the years, and al-
most all of them mention his distinc-
tion as the longest-tenured track-and- 
field coach in Michigan State Univer-
sity history. 
From 1968 to 1995, his students won 52 
Big Ten titles, 26 All-American honors, 
three NCAA titles, and broke two 
world records. 
But those who know Coach Bibbs will 
tell you that it has never been about 
the number of titles and his own ca-
reer. What has distinguished him over 
the years was the size of his heart and 
the kindness he has shown over the 
course of his life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H717 
February 25, 2021 
From high school to AAU club teams, 
collegiate squads, to national and 
international teams, Coach Bibbs lived 
by the words he spoke in 2010 when he 
was inducted into the MSU Athletics 
Hall of Fame: ‘‘I just loved track and I 
loved to work with the youngsters.’’ 
And yet, it almost didn’t happen. 
After graduating as a star baseball re-
cruit from Ecorse High School, he 
turned down a minor league contract 
offered by the Yankees to attend East-
ern Michigan University. 
At the time, EMU didn’t have a 
freshman baseball team, so he decided 
to join the track team instead. And as 
with the races he would win as a cham-
pion sprinter, he never looked back. 
Mr. Bibbs later became a teacher in 
Detroit before assuming the title of 
coach for the first time in 1959. He led 
his hometown high school in Ecorse to 
multiple championships before arriving 
in East Lansing as an assistant in 1968, 
the first African-American coach ever 
hired at Michigan State. 
In 1977, Coach Bibbs became head 
coach, and over the next 27 years, he 
inspired hundreds of student athletes 
to be their best selves by connecting 
their personal achievements on the 
track with their personal achievement 
in life. 
Many of his former runners have 
credited him with planting the seeds of 
confidence that allowed them to com-
pete all over the world. It is no surprise 
that several of them have paid it for-
ward by becoming track coaches them-
selves. 
Today, his path has taken him full 
circle as a volunteer with the team at 
East Lansing High School, where his 
son is the principal. 
Even after all the Hall of Fame in-
ductions and all the honors bestowed 
on him, Mr. Bibbs is still the same 
gentle and humble man he has always 
been, a man who loves track and the 
lessons it can teach others. 
His wife, Martha, who passed away in 
October of last year, was his partner of 
50 years. A trailblazer in her own right, 
she was the first woman and first 
Black woman to serve as personnel di-
rector for the State of Michigan. 
These two were a power couple in 
Lansing, recognized for their high pro-
file jobs and their contributions to the 
community. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to de-
liver these remarks so that Coach 
Bibbs’ achievements may forever exist 
in the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD, as a 
proud Spartan, as a legend in the track 
and field community, and as a pioneer 
for equality. 
RECOGNIZING THE DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
COMMISSION OF MID-MICHIGAN 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an organization 
that has been on the front lines of ad-
vocating for racial equality over the 
past 40 years: The Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Commission of Mid-Michigan. 
Founded in 1979, with the goal of es-
tablishing a Federal holiday for the 
icon of the civil rights movement, the 
MLK Commission realized its mission 
just 4 years after its founding. Ever 
since, the group has been working to 
preserve the legacy and teachings of 
Dr. King, in part, by supporting com-
munity 
agencies 
and 
empowering 
youth to achieve their goals. 
The Commission’s success can be 
found in its record: 40 high schoolers 
sponsored each year to go on a college 
tour of historically Black colleges and 
universities, more than $100,000 in 
scholarships awarded, and more than 
$70,000 in grants given to local organi-
zations. 
In the past, the Commission has sent 
delegations 
to 
notable 
milestone 
events, from the opening of the Na-
tional Museum of African American 
History and Culture to the 55th anni-
versary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, 
Alabama. 
Under the capable leadership of my 
friend, Ms. Elaine Hardy, its chair-
person, the MLK Commission has flour-
ished as a proud beacon of justice in 
our State. 
But to really understand the impact, 
you need only look at the annual Day 
of Celebration, the largest and longest- 
running in the entire country. I have 
been many times. 
Every third Monday of January, 
more than 1,500 attendees come to-
gether in Greater Lansing to recognize 
local students, hear from keynote 
speakers, and recommit to the unfin-
ished work of Dr. King. 
Each celebration is focused on one of 
Dr. King’s quotes. For this year’s 
event, held remotely for the first time 
due to the pandemic, the Commission 
selected: ‘‘Out of a mountain of de-
spair, a stone of hope,’’ and invited 
Bernice King to address the group. 
At a time when we face unprece-
dented challenges, the MLK Commis-
sion of Mid-Michigan is that stone of 
hope for so many in our beloved com-
munity. 
For 42 years, the Commission has 
shown what is possible when folks from 
all walks of life come together under 
the banner of equality and justice. 
May it continue to shine as an exam-
ple of community leadership for the 
next 42 years; and may its legacy live 
on forever in the official record of the 
U.S. Congress. 
HONORING THE LEGACIES OF JAMES RILEY, SR. 
AND JAMES RILEY, JR. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a father and son duo 
who, between them, have served Lan-
sing for over 60 years: James Riley, Sr. 
and James Riley, Jr. 
Their story begins when the elder 
Riley moved to Michigan after grad-
uating high school at 17. He took a job 
at the Ford plant in River Rouge but 
left 2 years later to join the military 
when World War II broke out. 
While stationed in Charleston, he 
met his future wife of 70 years, Deresa, 
at a dance. They moved back to De-
troit soon after, and Mr. Riley used his 
GI benefits to attend Wayne State Uni-
versity while working at the Post Of-
fice. 
On the advice of a friend, he majored 
in mortuary science, obtaining his li-
cense before moving to Lansing and 
starting Riley Funeral Home in 1957. 
As the oldest Black-owned funeral 
home, and perhaps even the oldest 
Black-owned business in Lansing, the 
Riley name is synonymous with being 
active in our community, being kind 
and courteous, and serving families 
with professionalism and grace. 
But it wasn’t an easy path. When Mr. 
Riley first set out to get his business 
off the ground, he found that no bank 
would extend him a loan. It was a time 
when financial institutions could deny 
a man a line of credit based on the 
color of his skin. 
Indeed, Mr. Riley would later recall 
that 
loan 
officers 
seemed 
almost 
amused by the novelty of a Black man 
asking for a loan. So he turned to the 
community, cobbling together his sav-
ings with some contributions from his 
sisters and friends who sold or lent him 
equipment. 
At first, business was slow. They had 
just seven services in their first year. 
This was the late 1950s, a time when 
African Americans would routinely be 
turned away from other funeral homes. 
If and when they were able to secure a 
service, they were continually assigned 
a date and relegated to the afternoon, 
after the White services were finished 
in the morning. 
And so it went for the Rileys in their 
first decade of operation, working hard 
to earn the trust of the community 
with sincerity and good faith. It took 
time and concerted effort, but by the 
time James, Jr. took over the business 
from his parents in 1993, Riley Funeral 
Home was handling 150 services per 
year. 
In a business that operates on trust, 
the younger Riley has taken his fam-
ily’s business even further, making 
sure that every family that comes to 
him is treated with care and respect. 
After almost 30 years at the helm, 
James Jr., has devoted the same atten-
tion to detail and standard of excel-
lence his father was known for. 
James, Sr., passed away in 2016, 1 
year after Deresa. And while they may 
be gone, it is clear that their legacy 
lives on with their son. 
Last October, I had the opportunity 
to visit Riley Funeral Home and talk 
to James personally about his family 
story. He shared how Black-owned 
businesses were routinely discrimi-
nated against and regularly denied cap-
ital and credit. It is thanks to legisla-
tion passed by this body that that dis-
crimination is no longer the case. 
The Rileys have overcome tremen-
dous obstacles to get where they are. It 
is my honor to recognize both father 
and son today so that their contribu-
tions to the Lansing community may 
live on in the permanent record of the 
House of Representatives. 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF GREGORY EATON 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate a living legend in Lansing, 
Mr. Gregory Eaton, proprietor of Greg-
ory’s Soul Food Bar & Grill.

February 25, 2021 
Mr. Eaton embodies the motto of ‘‘no 
job too small, no job too large.’’ It may 
be his name on the door, but he is often 
found on the floor, busing tables, offer-
ing refills, and making sure that guests 
are taken care of. 
Growing up, Mr. Eaton developed a 
legendary work ethic that continues to 
inspire to this day. His first jobs were 
shining shoes for his dad, who worked 
at the Lansing Country Club and later 
ran a shoe repair store. 
When Mr. Eaton was 20 years old, he 
founded his first company, Greg’s Jani-
torial Service, with the slogan, ‘‘We 
search for dirt.’’ He won cleaning con-
tracts the old fashioned way, by word 
of mouth, working hard, and helping 
others. 
He hired local student athletes as a 
way to help them. Even future super-
stars like Magic Johnson punched a 
time card under Mr. Eaton, for a whop-
ping $1.65 an hour. 
Mr. Eaton has lived a life out of a 
movie. He is one of only a handful of 
individuals to have attended all 53 
Super Bowls in person. He has been to 
title fights, the Masters, and was even 
in the stands at the 1968 Olympics when 
Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised 
their fists at the podium. 
But no matter how far and wide he 
travels, Mr. Eaton’s heart remains in 
Lansing. It remains with his three 
kids, 8 grandchildren, and one great- 
grandchild. And it remains with all the 
individuals he has helped along the 
way with his never-ending generosity. 
Even in the midst of a pandemic that 
has claimed so many local restaurants, 
Gregory’s Soul Food has been able to 
keep its doors open, thanks to a loyal 
and dependable clientele. Gregory’s is 
an institution, like the man it is 
named after. 
So today, I am proud to recognize 
him on the floor of the people’s House, 
so that future generations may learn 
about his selfless service to the Lan-
sing community. 
HONORING ALEX’S GREAT STATE RACE 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize an organization that brings 
together fierce rivals in the name of 
shared community; an organization 
that bridges the sometimes impossible 
differences between us; an organization 
helping to bring arch rivals together 
for the betterment of the community 
and, most specifically, an organization 
that literally bridges the 64 miles be-
tween Michigan State University in 
East Lansing and the University of 
Michigan in Ann Arbor. 
Most days, any Spartan or Wolverine 
will tell you that those miles are still 
too close for comfort. But on the Fri-
day before the big game between both 
schools, a new tradition has emerged in 
the name of charity, community spirit, 
and expanding access to education for 
all: It is called Alex’s Great State 
Race. 
Named after Alex Powell, a young 
man accepted to Michigan State as he 
underwent treatment for a rare and ag-
gressive 
cancer, 
Alex 
had 
always 
dreamed attending MSU. But the sur-
geries, chemo and radiation treatment 
left him unable to carry out his studies 
with the normal vigor of a freshman 
student. 
Thankfully, Alex turned to MSU’s 
Resource Center for Persons with Dis-
abilities, 
or 
RCPD. 
Devoted 
to 
inclusivity on campus for students, em-
ployees, and visitors alike, the RCPD 
provided Alex with a dorm room near 
his classes, offered support to him and 
his family, and accommodated his 
needs as they became more complex. 
They made arrangements to provide 
Alex the same MSU experience as any 
other student, even when he was being 
treated at a cancer center at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, 64 miles away. 
Despite has valiant fight, Alex lost 
his battle with cancer in 2011. Those 
around him remember his vibrant spir-
it and easy sense of humor, even in the 
midst of a debilitating illness. 
More than anything, Alex wanted to 
leave a legacy that would inspire oth-
ers, which is how his mother, Juliana, 
got in touch with the folks at the Re-
source Center who played such an im-
portant role in his life. 
Together, they created the Great 
State Race in Alex’s name, a charity 
organization 
dedicated 
to 
raising 
money for the RCPD, as well as its 
counterpart at the University of Michi-
gan, the Office of Services for Students 
with Disabilities. 
Now celebrating its seventh year, 
Alex’s Great State Race is an example 
of what can unite us. Each year, no 
matter how intense the rivalry be-
tween the two schools, ROTC cadets 
from both Michigan and Michigan 
State come together to run the game 
ball the 64 miles separating the two 
campuses. 
Supported by police that line the 
route, gracious donations that make it 
possible, and a community united by 
the spirit of charity, Alex’s Great 
State Race proves that despite our 
split allegiances, we absolutely have a 
common humanity. 
Today, I am proud to honor the Pow-
ell family, the ROTC cadets, and all of 
the folks involved at both schools who 
raise money for such a worthy cause. 
As the Jewish Prayer of Remem-
brance says: ‘‘So long as we live, they 
too shall live, for they are now a part 
of us, as we remember them.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, we all remember Alex 
as long as these words will exist in the 
CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD, which is to 
say, we remember Alex forever. 
b 2100 
HONORING JESSICA WITKOWSKI 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Jessica Witkowski, a 
young woman making a difference in 
her hometown of Hartland, Michigan. 
For her efforts, she has earned the dis-
tinction of being one of the first female 
Eagle Scouts in the country. Drawn by 
the Scouts’ emphasis on environmental 
stewardship, service to community, 
and development of leadership skills, 
Jessica joined the Scouts 2 years ago as 
a sophomore in high school, shortly 
after they opened membership to girls. 
She set her sights on a lofty goal, 
being a part of the inaugural class of 
female Eagle Scouts. After building 
and installing bluebird houses in Set-
tler’s Park for her Life Scout rank, she 
started 
brainstorming 
Eagle 
Scout 
projects that would similarly align 
with her love of the outdoors. 
But soon after, the pandemic hit, and 
stay-at-home orders forced a change. 
Like a good Scout, though, Jessica 
adapted. She soon realized that the 
greatest need in the community was 
for face masks for seniors in retire-
ment homes. Through Zoom meetings 
and video tutorials, she gathered 16 of 
her classmates and set out to teach 
them how to create face masks. 
The fact that she had never sewn be-
fore did not hold her back, nor did the 
fact that she would have to sew with 
gloves on in order to follow the best 
practices for sanitation and avoiding 
potential spread. 
From start to finish, the project took 
2 months. By the time it was com-
pleted, Jessica and her determined 
group of volunteers had surpassed their 
initial goal of creating 600 masks, 
which Jessica distributed to the three 
local organizations taking care of sen-
iors vulnerable to the pandemic. 
Last fall, just by chance, on a tour of 
cider mills in my district, I actually 
ran into Jessica at Spicer’s. Even now, 
I can still remember her infectious per-
sonality and her thousand-watt smile, 
even behind her face mask. She is an 
impressive young woman, and I am 
proud to represent her here in Con-
gress. 
Although we haven’t been able to 
hold her official court of honor due to 
the pandemic, I know that it will come, 
and Jessica will be able to celebrate 
her achievement surrounded by her 
friends and family. In the meantime, it 
is my personal honor to speak these re-
marks into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
so that folks back home can read about 
her hard work and dedicated service to 
community. 
CELEBRATING MARCUS GOLLER 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, lastly, I 
rise to pay tribute to Marcus Goller, a 
cornerstone of the Brighton commu-
nity who sadly passed away late last 
month. 
Marcus 
owned 
and 
operated 
the 
Brighton 
Coffeehouse 
and 
Theater 
alongside his wife, Amy, and their two 
kids, Spencer and Macy. 
The spot is a mainstay of downtown 
Brighton, a place to pop in for a quick 
coffee or pastry or to take in a show in 
its 70-seat black box theater. But be-
fore it was a reality, it was just a 
dream between a couple and their kids. 
Marcus had had a long career in the 
coffee business, running a chain of cof-
fee shops in college towns all across 
the Midwest. Amy had acted profes-
sionally and directed productions at 
Brighton High School.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H719 
February 25, 2021 
One day, while sitting in the chil-
dren’s reading room at a small book-
store on Main Street, they had the idea 
of opening their own coffeehouse. What 
started that day as a dream became a 
reality in 2018 when Brighton Coffee-
house and Theater opened its doors and 
quickly became a cornerstone of down-
town. 
It is the perfect place to gather. I 
still remember hosting a townhall con-
versation there in 2019 and the incred-
ible sense of community that you felt 
as soon as you walk in the door. It is 
the reason that student organizations 
and performers constantly use the 
space, because you immediately feel at 
home. 
As anyone will tell you, that is be-
cause of Marcus. He was the soul of 
Brighton Coffeehouse, a quiet, kind 
presence. 
He 
treated 
visitors 
like 
neighbors and neighbors like family, 
always making sure that they were 
well served and had everything they 
needed. 
It was his idea to start the Brighton 
Yacht Club, a fleet of dozens of little 
motorized remote-controlled sailboats 
that people could rent and sail on the 
millpond just outside. He loved his 
business, and the people loved his busi-
ness back. 
He would be the first to tell you that 
it wasn’t easy, that the road from a 
conversation to construction was filled 
with twists and turns and setbacks, but 
Marcus never met an obstacle he 
couldn’t overcome. 
His passing is our loss. To Amy, 
Spencer, and Macy, to all those who 
knew Marcus and loved him, may they 
hold on to the dark roasts, the baked 
goods, the theater productions that 
brought them close together. 
I speak these words today so that his 
legacy is forever remembered in the 
permanent RECORD
of the people’s 
House, letting all who read know 
Marcus made a difference. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
DISRUPTING THE TRADITIONAL 
FAMILY UNIT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, in the 
past, I have taken time to discuss 
Black Lives Matter, a powerful group 
in this past election, which I think was 
very instrumental in the Democratic 
Party retaining their majority, and 
talking about the Marxist roots of 
their founders. In their statement, 
‘‘What We Believe,’’ they, Black Lives 
Matter, clearly state that one of their 
goals is to disrupt the Western-pre-
scribed nuclear family structure. 
First of all, to say that the tradi-
tional family is a Western family is in-
sulting to all the people from East 
Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Mid-
dle East, Latin America, and sub-Saha-
ran Africa that already have mothers 
and fathers at home. This is not a 
Western thing. 
Nevertheless, it is apparent that the 
founders of Black Lives Matter did 
consider the traditional nuclear family 
something to be disrupted. And that is 
part of Marxism, to get rid of the tradi-
tional families. And it is scary that one 
of our two major political parties held 
its majority by closely aligning itself 
with this group. 
I have asked for a hearing before the 
Education 
Committee 
on 
the 
Pell 
Grant Program, which already bra-
zenly penalizes nuclear families—no 
hearing as of yet. But, today, I ran 
across an article in the City Journal 
called 
‘‘Failure 
Factory,’’ 
talking 
about the influence of, to a certain ex-
tent, Marxist ideology and, to a certain 
extent, critical race theory on their 
curriculum. 
This curriculum itself denigrates the 
traditional family. I don’t know why 
we would, in schools—and they are 
talking 
about 
the 
Buffalo 
Public 
Schools here—why in schools we would 
denigrate a traditional family with fa-
ther at home. 
This curriculum appears designed to 
make young people bitter, defeatist, 
and antipolice. Our poor children—and 
by poor, I don’t mean materially poor. 
Our poor children have to put up with 
this sort of curriculum. 
In other countries, strong families 
are the norm, and children are excel-
ling at math, reading, and science. 
They immigrate here, children from all 
different racial, religious, and cultural 
backgrounds, and they will outperform 
our homegrown students who get this 
antifamily, antipolice drivel. 
I would also ask my good friend Edu-
cation Chairman BOBBY SCOTT to hold 
a hearing on critical race theory, 
which is infecting our schools, before 
any more damage is done. The Federal 
Government puts $40 billion into K–12 
in this country, and we are spending a 
total of over $12,000 a child. If teachers 
are going to teach the students that 
families with fathers are not good, the 
police are racist, and that it is so dif-
ficult to achieve in this country, it 
doesn’t matter how much we spend. 
Please, chairman of the Education 
Committee, BOBBY SCOTT, hold a hear-
ing on critical race theory and the in-
fluence it has on our public schools. 
Again, I will mention the article de-
scribing the curriculum in the Buffalo 
Public Schools would be called ‘‘Fail-
ure Factory’’ in the City Journal. So if 
you want to Google ‘‘Failure Factory,’’ 
City Journal, you can read about what 
goes on in our Buffalo Public Schools. 
ICE AGE TRAIL 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Now, I would like 
to talk a little bit about an amend-
ment that was done in a bipartisan 
fashion, and I know far too many peo-
ple outside of Washington don’t realize 
that the vast majority of things we do 
here are in a bipartisan fashion. 
The amendment concerns the Ice Age 
Trail, a trail that winds throughout 
the Midwest. But in the State of Wis-
consin, it begins in the eastern part of 
the State in Door County and winds its 
way out the western part of the State 
on the Minnesota border. The Ice Age 
Trail goes through Manitowoc, She-
boygan, Fond du Lac, Columbia, Mar-
quette, and Waushara Counties in my 
district. 
According to a study by the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-Whitewater, the trail 
has had an annual economic impact of 
$113 million, drawing 1.2 million visi-
tors. 
Currently, the Ice Age Trail is not 
categorized as a unit of the National 
Park System administered by the De-
partment of the Interior. The bipar-
tisan amendment, which I worked on 
with my friend Congressman POCAN 
from the Madison area, would allow the 
Ice Age Trail that opportunity. 
As a unit of the National Park Sys-
tem, Federal funds will be allowed to 
go to Wisconsin for maintenance and 
improvement of these trails, which 
drive tourism and provide outdoor 
recreation opportunities for Wisconsin-
ites and visitors alike. 
More than thousands of years ago, an 
immense flow of glacial ice sculpted a 
landscape of remarkable beauty across 
Wisconsin. And let me tell you, I think 
Wisconsin is the most beautiful State 
we have. So, please, everybody come 
visit our Ice Age Trail. 
As the glacier retreated, it left be-
hind a variety of landscape features. 
These glacial remnants are now consid-
ered among the world’s finest examples 
of how continental glaciation sculpts 
our planet. 
The Ice Age National Scenic Trail is 
a thousand miles that highlights these 
landscape 
features 
as 
it 
travels 
through some of the State’s most beau-
tiful natural areas. The trail is entirely 
within Wisconsin. 
The Ice Age Trail is more than a path 
through the woods. It is a place for 
mental and physical rejuvenation, a 
place to unwind after a hard day and 
enjoy the landscape of Wisconsin. More 
than a million people use the trail each 
year to hike and snowshoe, to back-
pack, to disconnect, and to reconnect. 
Behind the scenes, a vibrant commu-
nity of volunteers across the State 
work to build and maintain the trail, 
making it one of the country’s best 
hiking experiences. 
I sincerely hope that the bill that is 
going to come up that we are going to 
vote on tomorrow, that this amend-
ment becomes part of that bill. I am 
confident that it will. 
It is going to improve the Ice Age 
Trail, making it even more consumer- 
friendly for the millions of Wisconsin-
ites who have taken advantage of the 
trail. Particularly this year, where we 
have way too many people sitting in-
side, it is going to be a great year to 
tour the trail. 
The trail was begun in the 1950s as 
the 
dream 
of 
Milwaukeean 
Ray 
Zillmer, who had a vision of a long, lin-
ear park winding through Wisconsin

along the glacier’s terminal moraine. 
This will be a great addition to the 
trail, and it will improve the experi-
ence of those who use it. 
BENEFITS OF VITAMIN D 
Mr. 
GROTHMAN. 
Let’s 
address 
COVID. While it appears we have 
turned the corner on COVID, it still ap-
pears as though we have over 2,000 
deaths most days. 
For whatever reason, the CDC and 
the public health establishment have 
refused to inform the public of the 
huge benefits of vitamin D. Almost 40 
percent of American adults are vitamin 
D deficient. 
This is a bigger problem in winter in 
the North, where people don’t get as 
much sun, and also a bigger problem 
with darker skinned populations and a 
bigger problem with older populations 
since older people don’t produce as 
much vitamin D. 
You should take 5,000 units of vita-
min D a day. If you have COVID, you 
should immediately take additional vi-
tamin D. Countries such as England al-
ready inform their population of the 
benefits of vitamin D, and in India, 
there is a study showing potentially 
huge benefits of large amounts of vita-
min D given to people as soon as they 
know they have this disease. 
It is unfortunate that our public 
health establishment has not pushed 
vitamin D as much as you would think 
they should. Please, America, look up 
the website vitaminDforall.org. Over 
200 experts, led by Dr. Karl Pfleger of 
California and Richard Carmona, Sur-
geon General under President Bush, are 
advocates of vitamin D. They believe 
science is on our side, and they believe 
that if we had adequately informed the 
40 percent of the population that was 
vitamin D deficient, we could have 
saved hundreds of thousands of lives in 
this pandemic. Please, we do not want 
any more patients to die with a vita-
min D deficiency. 
An interesting thing about vitamin 
D, a lot of times the medical establish-
ment is reluctant to push something 
forward because something horrible 
would happen to a given percentage of 
the population who take it, but there 
really is only a minimal downside to 
taking vitamin D, so I really wish the 
CDC would step up to the plate, as they 
have in other countries, and spend 
some of the time they spend talking 
about social distancing or masking, 
which we hear about all the time, edu-
cating people to take vitamin D. 
Dr. Fauci himself let it slip in an 
interview with a Hollywood actress 
that he takes vitamin D. But while he 
let it slip in kind of a fun interview, he 
doesn’t routinely tell the American 
public that, and I wish he would do 
that. I don’t know why Dr. Fauci would 
be so quiet about vitamin D when he, 
himself, has admitted that he takes a 
significant amount of it. 
The failure of CDC to issue guidances 
encouraging people to take vitamin D 
is one of the reasons why we have had 
so many fatalities. Let’s not lose any-
one else. 
Again, remember to look at the 
website, vitaminDforAll, and make 
sure you take vitamin D both for your-
self and for your family. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE BOARD 
OF DIRECTORS OF THE OFFICE 
OF CONGRESSIONAL WORKPLACE 
RIGHTS 
U.S. CONGRESS,
OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL
WORKPLACE RIGHTS, 
Washington, DC. 
February 25, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Section 102(b) of 
the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 
(CAA) requires the Board of Directors of the 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights 
(OCWR) to biennially submit a report con-
taining recommendations regarding Federal 
workplace rights, safety and health, and pub-
lic access laws and regulations that should 
be made applicable to Congress and its agen-
cies. The purpose of this report is to ensure 
that the rights afforded by the CAA to legis-
lative branch employees and visitors to Cap-
itol Hill and district and state offices remain 
equivalent to those in the private sector and 
the executive branch of the Federal Govern-
ment. As such, these recommendations sup-
port the intent of Congress to keep pace with 
advances in workplace rights and public ac-
cess laws. 
Accompanying this letter is a copy of the 
Board’s Section 102(b) Report for the 117th 
Congress. This report was submitted elec-
tronically to you and President Pro Tempore 
Grassley on December 31, 2020, which was the 
filing date required by statute. We welcome 
discussion on these issues and urge that Con-
gress act on these important recommenda-
tions. 
As required by the CAA, we request that 
this publication be printed in the Congres-
sional Record and referred to the Committee 
on House Administration as the committee 
of the U.S. House of Representatives with ju-
risdiction. 
Sincerely, 
SUSAN TSUI GRUNDMANN. 
Executive Director, 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. 
Attachment. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
FOR 
IMPROVE-
MENTS TO THE CONGRESSIONAL AC-
COUNTABILITY ACT 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights— 
Board of Directors’ Biennial Report re-
quired by 102(b) of the Congressional Ac-
countability Act issued at the conclusion of 
the 116th Congress for consideration by the 
117th Congress 
Statement from the Board of Directors 
With its enactment of the Congressional 
Accountability Act (CAA) in 1995, Congress 
first applied to the legislative branch the 
same laws regarding workplace rights and 
the employment relationship as governed the 
executive branch and private sector, includ-
ing those addressing discrimination, work-
place safety and health, wages and hours, ac-
cessibility, and collective bargaining and 
labor-management relations. Passage of the 
CAA in the opening days of the 104th Con-
gress with nearly unanimous approval re-
flected a Congressional promise to the Amer-
ican public that it would hold itself account-
able to the same federal workplace and ac-
cessibility standards as apply to private sec-
tor employers and executive branch agen-
cies. 
This commitment is not meant to be stat-
ic. Rather, the CAA provides for an ongoing, 
vigilant review of federal law to ensure that 
Congress continues to apply to itself—where 
appropriate—the labor, employment, health, 
and safety laws that it enacts. To further 
this goal, section 102(b) of the CAA tasks the 
Board of Directors of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights (OCWR) to review 
federal legislation and regulations to ensure 
that workplace protections in the legislative 
branch are on par with those applicable to 
private sector and executive branch agen-
cies. Accordingly, every Congress, the Board 
reports on: 
whether or to what degree [provisions of 
Federal law (including regulations) relating 
to (A) the terms and conditions of employ-
ment (including hiring, promotion, demo-
tion, termination, salary, wages, overtime 
compensation, benefits, work assignments or 
reassignments, grievance and disciplinary 
procedures, protection from discrimination 
in personnel actions, occupational health 
and safety, and family and medical and other 
leave) of employees; and (B) access to public 
services and accommodations] . . . are appli-
cable or inapplicable to the legislative 
branch, and (2B) with respect to provisions 
inapplicable 
to 
the 
legislative 
branch, 
whether such provisions should be made ap-
plicable to the legislative branch. 
This section of the CAA also requires that 
the presiding officers of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate cause our Re-
port to be printed in the Congressional 
Record and refer the report to Committees of 
the House and Senate with jurisdiction. 
In past Reports, the Board has taken a 
broad 
approach 
in 
presenting 
its 
rec-
ommendations to amend the CAA. In this 
Report, we highlight key recommendations 
that the Board has made in past Section 
102(b) Reports that have not yet been imple-
mented, as well as additional recommenda-
tions to amend the CAA to increase trans-
parency, discourage protracted administra-
tive proceedings at the taxpayers’ expense, 
and enjoin unlawful conduct. 
While recognizing the enormous impor-
tance of many of the other issues faced today 
by the 117th Congress, the Board is hopeful 
that issuance of this Section 102(b) Report 
will result in legislative action necessary to 
implement these recommendations so that 
the CAA remains current with the employ-
ment needs of the legislative branch. With-
out action on the Board’s recommendations, 
the worthy goals of the CAA gradually may 
be eroded. 
The Board welcomes an opportunity to fur-
ther discuss these recommendations and 
asks for careful consideration of the requests 
by the 117th Congress. 
Sincerely, 
BARBARA CHILDS WALLACE, 
Chair, Board of Direc-
tors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H722 
February 25, 2021 
SUSAN S. ROBFOGEL. 
Recommendations for the 117th Congress 
Amend the CAA to Allow the OCWR Board of 
Directors to Authorize the OCWR General 
Counsel to Seek Appropriate Temporary 
Relief after Filing an Unfair Labor Prac-
tice (ULP) Charge 
Section 220 of the CAA incorporates cer-
tain provisions of the Federal Service Labor- 
Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) 
to the legislative branch. 2 U.S.C. § 1351. In 
general, the OCWR General Counsel exer-
cises the same authority delegated to the 
General Counsel of the Federal Labor Rela-
tions Authority (FLRA) under 5 U.S.C. 
§ § 7104 and 7118 in the executive branch, that 
is, the authority to investigate allegations of 
ULPs and to file and prosecute complaints 
regarding ULPs. 
The CAA, however, does not currently in-
corporate the provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 7123(d), 
pursuant to which parties to ULP pro-
ceedings in the executive branch may re-
quest the FLRA General Counsel to seek ap-
propriate 
temporary 
relief, 
including 
issuance of a temporary restraining order. 
Specifically, section 7123(d) provides: 
The Authority may, upon issuance of a 
complaint as provided in section 7118 of this 
title charging that any person has engaged 
in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, 
petition any United States district court 
within any district in which the unfair labor 
practice in question is alleged to have oc-
curred or in which such person resides or 
transacts business for appropriate temporary 
relief (including a restraining order). Upon 
the filing of the petition, the court shall 
cause notice thereof to be served upon the 
person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction 
to grant any temporary relief (including a 
temporary restraining order) it considers 
just and proper. A court shall not grant any 
temporary relief under this section if it 
would interfere with the ability of the agen-
cy to carry out its essential functions or if 
the Authority fails to establish probable 
cause that an unfair labor practice is being 
committed. 
This important statutory provision in the 
FSLMRS allows the FLRA General Counsel 
to seek, in appropriate cases when a ULP 
Complaint is filed, temporary relief in any 
United States District Court when it would 
be just and proper to do so and the record es-
tablishes probable cause that an ULP is 
being committed. 
Incorporating 
the 
provisions 
5 
U.S.C. 
§ 7123(d) into the CAA would allow the OCWR 
Board to authorize the OCWR General Coun-
sel to seek appropriate temporary relief in 
the same manner and under the same cir-
cumstances. In the Board’s view, the grant of 
authority to the OCWR General Counsel to 
seek appropriate temporary relief under the 
CAA would, as has proven to be in the execu-
tive branch, operate as a strong disincentive 
for parties in the legislative branch to en-
gage 
in 
protracted 
administrative 
pro-
ceedings at the taxpayers’ expense while con-
tinuing to engage in ULPs.1 
Amend the Confidentiality Provisions of the 
CAA to Exclude Proceedings under the 
FSLMRS and the Public Access Provi-
sions of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA) (CAA Sections 210 and 220) 
The general confidentiality provisions of 
the CAA that govern administrative hear-
ings and deliberations are set forth at sec-
tion 416 of the Act. 2 U.S.C. § 1416. They cur-
rently provide in relevant part that ‘‘all pro-
ceedings and deliberations of hearing officers 
and the Board, including any related records, 
shall be confidential. This subsection shall 
not apply to proceedings under section 1341 
of this title [concerning proceedings under 
the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 (OSHAct)], but shall apply to the delib-
erations of hearing officers and the Board 
under that section.’’ Congress excluded pro-
ceedings under the OSHAct from these con-
fidentiality provisions because it determined 
that the public interest in transparency con-
cerning safety and health proceedings on 
Capitol Hill outweighed any value in keeping 
them confidential. 
The Board believes that the public interest 
in transparency outweighs any value in con-
fidentiality for proceedings under the ADA 
public access provisions and the labor-man-
agement provisions of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. 
§§ 1331, 1351. Unlike the individual employ-
ment matters covered by Part A of sub-
chapter II of the CAA where there is un-
doubtedly value in keeping individual per-
sonnel disputes confidential, the matters 
covered by Parts B (ADA public access), C 
(occupational safety and health), and D 
(labor-management relations) primarily in-
volve institutional and public concerns with 
maintaining facilities, policies, and pro-
grams that are safe, healthful, accessible, 
and free from ULPs. The current lack of 
transparency undermines the public’s con-
fidence that those statutory mandates are 
being fully enforced, encourages protracted 
litigation at taxpayer expense, and discour-
ages voluntary compliance. 
Accordingly, the Board recommends that 
section 416 of the CAA be amended to exclude 
from its confidentiality provisions, pro-
ceedings under the FSLMRS and the public 
access provisions of the ADA. This could be 
accomplished by amending the second sen-
tence in CAA section 416(b) as follows: ‘‘This 
subsection shall not apply to proceedings 
under sections 1331, 1341, and 1351 of this 
title, but shall apply to deliberations of 
hearing officers and the Board under these 
sections.’’ 
Amend the Voluntary Mediation Provisions 
of the CAA’s Administrative Dispute Res-
olution (ADR) Procedures to Require Me-
diation upon Request of the Claimant 
Prior to the CAA Reform Act, the CAA’s 
ADR 
procedures 
required, 
among 
other 
things, that an employee file a request for 
mediation with the OCWR as a jurisdictional 
prerequisite to filing a complaint with the 
OCWR or in the U.S. District Court. Further, 
the CAA provided that the mediation period 
‘‘shall be 30 days,’’ which could be extended 
upon the joint request of the parties. 
As a result of the CAA Reform Act amend-
ments, however, mediation is no longer man-
datory—rather, mediation takes place only if 
requested and only if both parties agree. 2 
U.S.C. § 1403. This change from mandatory to 
voluntary mediation was enacted amid con-
cerns that the mandatory mediation process 
could serve to delay the availability of statu-
tory relief for victims of harassment or other 
conduct prohibited by the CAA. Concerns 
were also expressed that employees could 
view the mandatory mediation process as in-
timidating—especially those who are unrep-
resented by counsel in mediation but who 
face an employing office represented by legal 
counsel. The amendment was also enacted 
amid consensus that mediation is most suc-
cessful when claimants feel comfortable and 
adequately supported in the process. 
The Board continues to view mediation as 
a valuable option available to settle disputes 
under the CAA. The OCWR’s experience over 
many years has been that a large percentage 
of controversies have been successfully re-
solved 
without 
formal 
adversarial 
pro-
ceedings, due in large part to its mediation 
processes. Mediation can save the parties 
from burdensome litigation, which can be ex-
pensive, time consuming, and a drain on re-
sources and workplace productivity. Medi-
ation also gives the parties an opportunity 
to explore resolving the dispute themselves 
without having a result imposed upon them. 
Furthermore, OCWR mediators are highly 
skilled professionals who have the sensi-
tivity, expertise, and flexibility to customize 
the mediation process to meet the concerns 
of the parties. In short, the effectiveness of 
mediation as a tool to resolve workplace dis-
putes cannot be understated. 
The Board is concerned, however, that the 
CAA Reform Act amendments requiring the 
consent of both parties to mediation effec-
tively gives the employing offices a veto 
over claimants who wish to attempt to settle 
their claims with the assistance of an OCWR 
mediator. None of the concerns expressed at 
the time the CAA Reform Act was passed 
warrant such a result. Moreover, none of the 
policies underlying mediation are furthered 
when an employee’s request for mediation is 
effectively denied by the employing office. 
Further, there is no indication that an em-
ploying office would be adversely affected if 
it were required to participate in mediation 
when it is requested by the claimant. Requir-
ing mediation upon the request of a claimant 
will maximize the chances of achieving a 
voluntary settlement that best meets the 
needs of all parties to the dispute. 
Accordingly, the Board recommends that 
the CAA be amended to provide that medi-
ation take place if requested by the claim-
ant, or if requested by the employing office 
and agreed to by the claimant. 
Protect Employees Who Serve on Jury Duty 
(28 U.S.C. § 1875) 
Section 1875 of title 28 of the U.S. Code pro-
vides that no employer shall discharge, 
threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce 
any permanent employee by reason of such 
employee’s jury service, or the attendance or 
scheduled attendance in connection with 
such service, in any court of the United 
States. This section currently does not cover 
legislative branch employment. For the rea-
sons set forth in the 1996, 1998, 2000, 2006, and 
2019 Section 102(b) Reports, the Board rec-
ommends that the rights and protections 
against discrimination on this basis should 
be applied to covered employees and employ-
ing offices within the legislative branch. 
Protect Employees and Applicants Who Are 
or Have Been In Bankruptcy (11 U.S.C. 
§ 525) 
Section 525(a) of title 11 of the U.S. Code 
provides that ‘‘a governmental unit’’ may 
not deny employment to, terminate the em-
ployment of, or discriminate with respect to 
employment against, a person because that 
person is or has been a debtor under the 
bankruptcy statutes. This provision cur-
rently does not apply to the legislative 
branch. Reiterating the recommendations 
made in the 1996, 1998, 2000, 2006, and 2019 
Section 102(b) Reports, the Board advises 
that the rights and protections against dis-
crimination on this basis should be applied 
to covered employees and employing offices 
within the legislative branch. 
Prohibit Discharge of Employees Who Are or 
Have Been Subject to Garnishment (15 
U.S.C. § 1674(a)) 
Section 1674(a) of title 15 of the U.S. Code 
prohibits discharge of any employee because 
his or her earnings ‘‘have been subject to 
garnishment for any one indebtedness.’’ This 
section is limited to private employers, so it 
currently has no application to the legisla-
tive branch. For the reasons set forth in the 
1996, 1998, 2000, 2006, and 2019 Section 102(b) 
Reports, the Board recommends that the 
rights and protections against discrimina-
tion on this basis should be applied to cov-
ered employees and employing offices within 
the legislative branch.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H723 
February 25, 2021 
Provide Whistleblower Protections to the 
Legislative Branch 
Civil service law provides broad protection 
to whistleblowers in the executive branch to 
safeguard workers against reprisal for re-
porting violations of laws, rules, or regula-
tions, gross mismanagement, gross waste of 
funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial 
and specific danger to public health or safe-
ty. In the private sector, whistleblowers also 
are often protected by provisions of specific 
federal laws. However, these provisions do 
not apply to the legislative branch. 
The OCWR has received a number of in-
quiries from congressional employees con-
cerned about their lack of whistleblower pro-
tections. The absence of specific statutory 
protection against reprisal such as that pro-
vided under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8) chills the dis-
closure of vital information in the public in-
terest to guard against legislative branch 
mismanagement and abuse. Granting whis-
tleblower protection could significantly im-
prove the rights and protections afforded to 
legislative branch employees in an area fun-
damental to the institutional integrity of 
the legislative branch by uncovering waste 
and fraud and safeguarding the budget. 
The Board has recommended in its pre-
vious Section 102(b) Reports and continues to 
recommend that Congress provide whistle-
blower reprisal protections to legislative 
branch employees comparable to that pro-
vided to executive branch employees under 5 
U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8) and 5 U.S.C. § 1221. Addi-
tionally, the Board recommends that the Of-
fice be granted investigatory and prosecu-
torial authorities over whistleblower reprisal 
complaints, by incorporating into the CAA 
the authority granted to the Office of Spe-
cial Counsel, which investigates and pros-
ecutes claims of whistleblower reprisals in 
the executive branch. 
Provide Subpoena Authority to Obtain Infor-
mation Needed for Safety and Health In-
vestigations and Require Records to Be 
Kept of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses 
The CAA applies the broad protections of 
section 5 of the OSHAct to the congressional 
workplace. The OCWR enforces the OSHAct 
in the legislative branch much in the same 
way the Secretary of Labor enforces the 
OSHAct in the private sector. Under the 
CAA, the OCWR is required to conduct safety 
and health inspections of covered employing 
offices at least once each Congress and in re-
sponse to any request, and to provide em-
ploying offices with technical assistance to 
comply with the OSHAct’s requirements. 
But Congress and its agencies are still ex-
empt from critical OSHAct requirements im-
posed upon American businesses. Under the 
CAA, employing offices in the legislative 
branch are not subject to investigative sub-
poenas to aid in inspections as are private 
sector employers under the OSHAct. Simi-
larly, Congress exempted itself from the 
OSHAct’s recordkeeping requirements per-
taining to workplace injuries and illnesses 
that apply to the private sector. 
The Board continues to recommend that 
legislative branch employing offices be sub-
ject to the investigatory subpoena provisions 
contained in OSHAct section 8(b) and that 
legislative branch employing offices be re-
quired to maintain records of workplace in-
juries and illnesses under OSHAct section 
8(c), 29 U.S.C. § 657(c), in the interests of the 
safety and health of legislative branch em-
ployees. 
Adopt Recordkeeping Requirements under 
Federal Workplace Rights Laws 
The Board has recommended in several 
Section 102(b) Reports, and continues to rec-
ommend that Congress adopt all record-
keeping requirements under federal work-
place rights laws, including title VII. Al-
though some employing offices in the legis-
lative branch keep personnel records, there 
are no legal requirements under the CAA to 
do so. 
Approve the Board’s Pending ADA Public Ac-
cess Regulations 
The CAA directs the OCWR Board to pro-
mulgate regulations implementing the CAA 
to keep Congress current and accountable to 
the workplace laws that apply to private and 
public employers. The Board is required to 
issue substantive regulations to achieve par-
ity, unless there is good cause shown to devi-
ate from the private sector or executive 
branch regulations. Pursuant to section 304 
of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384, the procedure for 
proposing and approving substantive regula-
tions provides that: (1) the Board of Direc-
tors proposes substantive regulations and 
publishes a general notice of proposed rule-
making in the Congressional Record; (2) 
there be a comment period of at least 30 days 
after the date of publication of the general 
notice of proposed rulemaking; (3) after con-
sideration of comments by the Board of Di-
rectors, the Board adopts regulations and 
transmits notice of such action (together 
with the regulations and a recommendation 
regarding the method for congressional ap-
proval of the regulations) to the Speaker of 
the House and President Pro Tempore of the 
Senate for publication in the Congressional 
Record; (4) there be committee referral and 
action on the proposed regulations by resolu-
tion in each House, concurrent resolution, or 
by joint resolution; and (5) there be final 
publication of the approved regulations in 
the Congressional Record, with an effective 
date prescribed in the final publication. 
The Board recommended in its 2019 Section 
102(b) Report to the 116th Congress that Con-
gress approve the Board’s pending regula-
tions that would implement titles II and III 
of the ADA in the legislative branch. The 
Board again recommends in this Report that 
Congress approve its adopted regulations. 
Public access to Capitol Hill and con-
stituent access to district and state offices 
have long been congressional hallmarks of 
our democracy. The Board’s ADA regula-
tions, which await Congressional approval, 
further ensure that continued access. First, 
the Board’s ADA regulations clarify which 
title II and title III regulations apply to the 
legislative branch. This knowledge will un-
doubtedly save taxpayers money by ensuring 
pre-construction 
review 
of 
construction 
projects for ADA compliance—rather than 
providing for only post-construction inspec-
tions and costly redos when the access is not 
adequate. Second, under the regulations 
adopted by the Board, all leased spaces must 
meet some basic accessibility requirements 
that apply to all federal facilities that are 
leased or constructed. In this way, Congress 
will remain a model for ADA compliance and 
public access. Under the authority of the 
landmark CAA, the OCWR has made signifi-
cant progress toward making Capitol Hill 
more accessible for persons with disabilities. 
Our efforts to improve access to the build-
ings and facilities on the campus are con-
sistent with the priority guidance in the 
Board’s ADA regulations, which it adopted 
in February 2016. Congressional approval of 
those regulations would reaffirm its commit-
ment to provide barrier-free access to the 
Capitol Hill complex for the visiting public. 
Approve the Board’s Pending FMLA and 
USERRA Regulations When They Are Re-
submitted to Congress 
The Board also recommended in its Sec-
tion 102(b) Report to the 116th Congress that 
Congress approve its pending regulations to 
implement the Family and Medical Leave 
Act (FMLA) and the Uniformed Services Em-
ployment and Reemployment Rights Act 
(USERRA). As discussed below, however, fur-
ther legislative developments, including the 
enactment of the CAA of 1995 Reform Act of 
2018, Pub. L. No. 115–397, and Federal Em-
ployee Paid Leave Act (FEPLA) (subtitle A 
of title LXXVI of division F of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2020, Public Law 116–92, December 20, 2019), 
have and will necessitate further amend-
ments of these regulations, which the Board 
will resubmit to Congress for approval. 
THE BOARD’s FMLA REGULATIONS 
On June 22, 2016, the Board adopted and 
submitted for publication in the Congres-
sional Record additional amendments to its 
substantive 
regulations 
regarding 
the 
FMLA. 162 Cong. Rec. H4128–H4168, S4475– 
S4516 (daily ed. June 22, 2016). The 2016 
amendments provided needed clarity on cer-
tain aspects of the FMLA. First, they added 
the military leave provisions of the FMLA, 
enacted under the National Defense Author-
ization Acts for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2010, 
Pub. L. 110–181, Div. A, Title V 585(a)(2), 
(3)(A)-(D) and Pub. L. 111–84, Div. A, Title V 
565(a)(1)(B) and (4), which extended the avail-
ability of FMLA leave to family members of 
the regular armed forces for qualifying ex-
igencies arising out of a servicemember’s de-
ployment. They also defined those deploy-
ments covered under these provisions, ex-
tended FMLA military caregiver leave for 
family members of current servicemembers 
to include an injury or illness that existed 
prior to service and was aggravated in the 
line of duty while on active duty, and ex-
tended FMLA military caregiver leave to 
family members of certain veterans with se-
rious injuries or illnesses. Second, the 
amendments set forth the revised definition 
of ‘‘spouse’’ under the FMLA in light of the 
Department of Labor’s February 25, 2015 
Final Rule on the definition of spouse, and 
the United States Supreme Court’s decision 
in Obergefell, et al., v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 
(2015), which requires a state to license a 
marriage between two people of the same sex 
and to recognize a marriage between two 
people of the same sex when their marriage 
was lawfully licensed and performed out-of- 
state. 
Congress has not yet acted on the Board’s 
request for approval of these 2016 amend-
ments. However, on December 20, 2019, it en-
acted the FEPLA, which further amended 
the FMLA to allow most civilian federal em-
ployees, including eligible employees in the 
legislative branch, to substitute up to 12 
weeks of paid parental leave for unpaid 
FMLA leave granted in connection with the 
birth of an employee’s son or daughter or for 
the placement of a son or daughter with an 
employee for adoption or foster care. Fur-
ther modifications of the Board’s substantive 
regulations are therefore necessary in order 
to bring existing legislative branch FMLA 
regulations (issued April 19, 1996) in line with 
these recent statutory changes. 
Accordingly, on November 16, 2020, the 
OCWR Board issued a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking and request for comments from 
interested parties, which concerns additional 
proposed amendments to the Board’s sub-
stantive FMLA regulations to implement 
FEPLA. The Board also proposed to amend 
these regulations to update references to the 
OCWR’s current administrative dispute reso-
lution procedures, which were significantly 
amended by the CAA of 1995 Reform Act of 
2018. The comment period ended 30 days from 
the date of publication of the Board’s notice 
in the Congressional Record, i.e., on Decem-
ber 17, 2020. The Board is currently reviewing 
the comments it received and is preparing its 
Notice of Adopted Rulemaking for publica-
tion in the Congressional Record. The

Board’s Notice of Adopted Rulemaking will 
also constitute the resubmission for congres-
sional approval of its 2016 amendments to its 
substantive 
FMLA 
regulations 
discussed 
above. Congressional approval of the Board’s 
adopted FMLA regulations when they are re-
submitted will be critical to implementing 
these expanded family and medical leave 
protections in the legislative branch. 
THE BOARD’s USERRA REGULATIONS 
On December 3, 2008, the OCWR Board of 
Directors adopted USERRA regulations to 
apply to the legislative branch. These regu-
lations support our nation’s veterans by re-
quiring continuous health care insurance 
and job protections for the men and women 
of the armed services who have supported 
our country’s freedoms. They signal a com-
mitment to anti-discrimination, anti-retal-
iation, and job protections under USERRA. 
Those regulations, transmitted to Congress 
over 10 years ago, have not yet been ap-
proved. As with the Board’s FMLA regula-
tions, however, it has become necessary to 
make additional amendments to these regu-
lations to update references to the OCWR’s 
current administrative dispute resolution 
procedures that were significantly amended 
by the CAA of 1995 Reform Act of 2018. 
Approving the USERRA regulations when 
they are resubmitted for approval will assist 
servicemembers in attaining and retaining a 
job despite the call to duty. Approving 
USERRA regulations would signal congres-
sional encouragement to veterans to seek 
work in the legislative branch where veteran 
employment levels have historically been 
well below the percentage in the executive 
branch, or even in the private sector, which 
is not under a mandate to provide a pref-
erence in hiring to veterans. Indeed, many 
reports have put the level of veteran employ-
ees on congressional staffs at 2–3 percent or 
less. 
Congress has long focused on issues con-
cerning the health, welfare, accessibility, 
and employment status of veterans on Cap-
itol Hill. For example, the Veterans Congres-
sional Fellowship Caucus, started in 2014, has 
supported efforts to bridge the gap between 
military service and legislative work. In ad-
dition, the Wounded Warrior Fellowship Pro-
gram exists in the office of the Chief Admin-
istrative Officer of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives where Members can hire veteran 
Fellows for 2-year terms. In the Senate, the 
Armed Forces Internship Program exists to 
provide on-the-job training for returning vet-
erans with disabilities. Further, Public Law 
No. 115–364, signed into law in 2018, makes 
clear that disabled veterans in the legisla-
tive branch are covered under the provisions 
of the Wounded Warrior Act. As such, they 
may receive wounded warrior leave during 
their first year in the workforce for treat-
ment for their service-connected disabilities. 
An extension of these laudable efforts in 
support of our veterans should include the 
long-delayed passage of the Board’s adopted 
USERRA regulations, which implement pro-
tections 
for 
initial 
hiring 
and 
protect 
against discrimination based on military 
service. Congress can lead by example by ap-
plying the USERRA law encompassed in the 
CAA. 
Approving the three sets of Board-adopted 
regulations outlined above would not only 
signify a continued congressional commit-
ment to the laws of the CAA—which passed 
in 1995 with nearly unanimous bicameral and 
bipartisan support—but would ensure the ef-
fective implementation of the laws’ work-
place protections and benefits on behalf of 
the legislative branch workforce. 
ENDNOTES 
1. The Board has long advocated for legislation 
granting the OCWR General Counsel the authority 
to investigate and prosecute complaints of discrimi-
nation, harassment, and reprisal in order to assist 
victims and to improve the adjudicatory process 
under the CAA. On December 21, 2018, as we were in 
the process of finalizing the Section 102(b) Report 
for the 116th Congress, the CAA of 1995 Reform Act, 
S. 3749, was signed into law. As discussed in that Re-
port, the Reform Act establishes new procedures 
that are also clearly intended to further these policy 
goals. Under these circumstances, the Board be-
lieves that the best course of action is to continue 
to evaluate the efficacy of the new Reform Act pro-
cedures before revisiting the issue of whether the 
OCWR General Counsel should be granted such in-
vestigatory and prosecutorial authority. Accord-
ingly, this recommendation is not discussed further 
in this Report.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2021 
No. 36 
Senate 
The Senate met at 11 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Righteous God, Your power is unsur-
passed. Manifest Your might during 
this challenging season. Lord, show us 
Your strength. 
Use our Senators for Your glory. Pro-
vide them with the wisdom to look 
ahead and to count the cost. Inspire 
them to desire, above all else, to re-
main within the circle of Your loving 
and prevailing providence. Lord, give 
them sufficient caution to see the dan-
ger coming and refuse to plunge ahead. 
And, Lord, we thank You for the 
amazing service of Secretary Julie 
Adams. 
We pray in Your holy Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
the Senate is laser-focused on con-
firming President Biden’s impressive 
Cabinet while paving the way for an-
other round of urgent COVID relief. 
The two tasks will remain the top Sen-
ate priorities over the next several 
weeks. 
By the end of this week, the Senate 
will have confirmed three Cabinet-level 
officials—the U.N. Ambassador and the 
Secretaries of Agriculture and En-
ergy—and will have set up confirma-
tion votes early next week for the Sec-
retaries of Education and Commerce 
and the Chair of the Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers. 
This week, Senate committees also 
held confirmation hearings on scores of 
other nominations, including the Presi-
dent’s candidates for Attorney General, 
HHS Secretary, Interior Secretary, CIA 
Director, Surgeon General, and U.S. 
Trade Representative. 
At the same time, Democrats are pre-
paring to proceed with the urgently 
needed President Biden American Res-
cue Plan, a $1.9 trillion lifeline that 
will lay the foundation for economic 
recovery and a return to life as normal. 
We have come a long way in our fight 
against COVID, but we still have a long 
way to go. Over 60 million vaccinations 
have now been administered across the 
country. Death rates are finally, fi-
nally declining. But while the trends 
are headed in the right direction, more 
Americans are still dying per day than 
at any point during the worst weeks of 
last summer. 
The same goes for our economy. 
While there are green shoots, our coun-
try remains 10 million jobs short of 
where we were last February—10 mil-
lion jobs short. That is nothing to tri-
fle with or pass over. Today’s report on 
new jobless claims was the 49th week 
that the number was higher than at 
any point during the great recession. 
Let me repeat that. Today’s report 
on the number of Americans filing for 
unemployment benefits for the first 
time was the 49th week during the 
COVID pandemic that new unemploy-
ment claims were higher than at any 
point during the great recession. In the 
words of Fed Chairman Powell, hardly 
a big liberal, ‘‘The economic recovery 
remains uneven and far from complete, 
and the path ahead is highly uncer-
tain.’’ 
That is from a very serious, staid 
man not prone to any hyperbole at all. 
But what he is telling us is simple: We 
cannot take our foot off the gas. We 
cannot slow down before the race is 
won. We must proceed boldly and deci-
sively. 
Senate Democrats will move forward 
on the American Rescue Plan as soon 
as possible. The bill will erase any 
doubt that the American people, busi-
nesses, families, workers will have the 
resources that they need until we can 
defeat the virus and our economy 
comes roaring back. The American 
people should expect nothing less. 
Just yesterday, over 150 executives 
from the Nation’s business community 
said that taking action on the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan is the right thing to 
do. The business community is firmly 
lined up behind this plan. Earlier this 
month, 400 mayors from both parties, 
Democratic and Republican, sent a let-
ter to Congress supporting the plan and 
the help it provides to keep teachers 
and firefighters and other essential 
public employees on the job. 
In poll after poll, the American pub-
lic overwhelmingly supports congres-
sional action on a bold COVID relief 
package, a majority of Democrats and 
a majority of Republicans. As many as 
7 in 10 Americans support the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. There is a clear, bi-
partisan, nationwide mandate to act, 
and that is just what the Senate is 
going to do—a clear, bipartisan, na-
tionwide mandate to act, and that is 
what we will do. 
Now, from the start, we had hoped 
this effort would be bipartisan. As I 
said before, there is nothing about the 
budget process that precludes biparti-
sanship. The same process has been 
used no fewer than 17 times to produce 
major bipartisan legislation. But it 
seems that despite the historic nature 
of the crisis, despite the clear and 
pressing needs of the country, despite 
the support of mayors and Governors 
and economists and business leaders 
from across the political spectrum, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S874 
February 25, 2021 
despite the popularity of the legisla-
tion with the American people, my Re-
publican colleagues are organizing to 
oppose the next round of COVID relief. 
A report in CNN suggested that Re-
publican leaders were ‘‘maneuvering’’ 
to keep every single Republican from 
supporting the American Rescue Plan, 
an exercise in pure partisanship. We 
have started to hear the same predict-
able objections in almost the same 
exact words that Republicans use in re-
sponse to nearly every piece of Demo-
cratic legislation: ‘‘a liberal wish list’’; 
‘‘socialism.’’ 
One Republican Member said that the 
American Rescue Plan was ‘‘to the left 
of Lenin.’’ Seriously, to the left of 
Lenin? Money for schools, vaccines, di-
rect checks to struggling American 
families—checks 
that 
nearly 
every 
Member of the Senate supported just a 
few months ago—now it is to the left of 
Lenin? 
This kind of reflexive partisan oppo-
sition is not going to wash with the 
American people. It wouldn’t wash at 
any time, but it especially doesn’t 
wash during this time of crisis. The 
American people have all heard it be-
fore, and they know the country needs 
help. 
All week our Republican colleagues 
have 
been 
raising 
concerns 
about 
school closures. Well, I will tell you 
what, we all want to open schools. We 
all want them to reopen. We are all 
concerned, though, about the cost of 
remote learning on children and par-
ents. So are the teachers. So are the 
children. So are the parents. 
But how about we actually give 
schools the funding they need to re-
open as quickly and safely as possible? 
That funding is in the American Res-
cue Plan. While our Republican col-
leagues are cynically attacking teach-
ers—something they have done for dec-
ades—the school districts in their 
States are telling them they need more 
funding. Their school districts are tell-
ing them they need more funding to 
hire extra teachers and reduce class 
size, to change the infrastructure of 
their 
schools 
to 
increase 
social 
distancing, to hire tutors for summer 
school and the fall to help our children 
make up for lost time. 
The education commissioner for the 
State of Nebraska, hardly a Demo-
cratic 
stronghold, 
put 
it 
simply: 
‘‘There’s a lot of damage to repair.’’ 
Our 
Republican 
colleagues 
want 
schools to reopen. So do we. But what 
about actually doing something to 
make that happen as safely and as 
quickly as possible? 
It seems my Republican colleagues 
have even taken issue with the tiny 
amount of funding in the bill that goes 
to a bridge in New York. They say: 
Look, a pork-barrel earmark from the 
Democratic leader, totally non-COVID- 
related. The truth is, this is one of the 
only bridges operated by the Federal 
Government. Its revenues for operating 
expenses have collapsed because of 
COVID. No one is using the bridge. 
Ironically, the bridge is located in a 
district represented in the House by a 
Republican. And the request for this 
funding wasn’t made by me or any 
Democrat, for that matter. It came 
from 
the 
Trump 
administration 
5 
months ago. I learned about it being in 
the bill when I read about it in the 
newspaper. 
That is how silly the talking points 
of the other side have gotten. Repub-
licans are not happy about a small pro-
vision in the bill requested by the pre-
vious Republican administration, so 
they are going to oppose direct checks 
to struggling families, another round 
of assistance for small businesses, and 
money for schools and vaccinations. 
The argument is absurd and, we know, 
a total excuse. 
Look, we Democrats would prefer to 
work with our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to pass this bill. We 
had an open, bipartisan amendment 
process on the budget resolution. We 
have already included many bipartisan 
amendments the Senate adopted into 
this new reconciliation bill. The first 
amendment we put on the floor for the 
restaurants was bipartisan, and that 
was the first amendment I put on the 
floor as majority leader, showing my 
intent to be bipartisan. 
But, at the end of the day, we cannot 
let obstructionism stop us. At the end 
of the day, the American people sent us 
here with a job to do. 
The bottom line is simple: We are 
still in a historic crisis of the health of 
the economy. The American people 
know we are in a historic crisis. And 
the Senate will soon take action on our 
plan to solve this crisis, a plan with 
overwhelming public support. Our Re-
publican colleagues will have to decide 
whether they will work with us to ap-
prove the legislation or obstruct it to 
the bitter end. 
I yield the floor.

WELCOMING ANN BERRY 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate what the leader just said about 
COVID. It certainly reflects the feel-
ings of people in my State that we have 
to get going. 
But I am here on a different matter 
today. Since the 1780s, we have had an 
extraordinary list of Secretaries of the 
Senate. The outgoing Secretary Julie 
Adams is one of those extraordinary 
people who have been here, and I have 
had the distinct pleasure and honor of 
serving with so many. 
But let me be personal for a moment. 
On Monday, in my role as President 
pro tempore, I will administer the oath 
of 
office 
to 
an 
amazing 
person, 
Sonceria Ann Berry. She will become 
the Secretary of the Senate. 
This is a woman who earned her 
bachelor’s degree in education from the 
University of North Alabama, and she 
has had so much experience in the Sen-
ate. She first worked for Senator How-
ell Heflin of Alabama. 
I had the pleasure of serving with 
Senator Heflin—as I found when I 
would travel to Alabama with him, he 
usually would be greeted with ‘‘Hello, 
Judge.’’ He was a man who had an ex-
traordinary sense of how the Senate 
worked but made very clear to me how 
much he relied on Ann Berry. She 
worked with other good friends of 
mine: Senator Pat Moynihan, whose of-
fice was right down the hall from mine, 
and Senator Edwards and Senator CAR-
PER. She took time out from her duties 
in my office to help stand up Senator 
JONES’ office. 
She came to the Leahy office in 2007, 
and she worked with my chief of staff, 
J.P. Dowd. They gave such leadership 
to my office, and I have found that al-
most daily, I would stick my head into 
Ann’s office and say: Here is the situa-
tion; what do you think we should do 
here or there? I knew what a go-to in 
the Senate she had been for genera-
tions of staffers, a mentor to dozens of 
young staffers and interns. I have also 
said over and over again that we Sen-
ators are merely a constitutional im-
pediment to our staffs. Well, this im-
pediment was delighted he could go to 
Ann Berry and seek help and advice. 
I think of her and her family—Regi-
nald, her wonderful husband, and her 
daughter, Elizabeth, whom I have had a 
chance to see grow up to become a 
young woman who is distinguishing 
herself working here in the Senate. 
I also think of her sayings, like 
‘‘This, too, shall pass’’ or ‘‘I may have 
been born at night, but I wasn’t born 
last night.’’ ‘‘There is more than one 
way to skin a cat,’’ or sometimes when 
we had been here late into the night, 
she says, ‘‘Nothing good happens after 
midnight.’’ But with her, everything 
good happened. 
I think of the Senate and all of us in 
it, in a way, as a family. Over my years 
here, I have become more and more 
aware of that. But Ann Berry truly 
was. I don’t know how many times 
somebody working in my office would 
have an issue—not just the profes-
sionals things; she was always there to 
answer those and give direction. They 
would go in and say, ‘‘You know, I have 
had this thing that has been troubling 
me’’ and know that they could get 
wonderful advice but also advice in 
confidence. 
I will admit that my grandchildren, 
my wife and I think the world of her. 
We do have one grandchild, now 15, but

for the last few years, he would be in 
my office, and he would say, ‘‘I want to 
go leave a note for Miss Ann,’’ and 
young Patrick would go and leave 
notes for her. It is a kind of family. 
I think the world of our majority 
leader. When he told me that he want-
ed to appoint Ann Berry as Secretary 
of the Senate, I told him I will forgive 
him this once only because of her ex-
traordinary capabilities. 
I will speak more about her next 
week, but one thing that is going to 
give me pride because of who it in-
volves is that on Monday, as President 
pro tempore, I will administer the oath 
of office to the extraordinary Ann 
Berry, and I will do it as one of the 
proudest moments since I have been

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
next week, House Democrats say they 
will try to recycle failed legislation 
that would have Washington Demo-
crats grab unprecedented power over 
how America conducts its elections and 
how American citizens can engage in 
political speech. 
For several years now, we have seen 
the political left grow less interested 
in having normal policy debates within 
our governing institutions and more 
interested in attacking the institutions 
themselves to tilt the playing field in 
their side’s favor. 
When their side loses a Presidential 
election, it is not their fault; it is the 
electoral college’s. When they don’t 
like a Supreme Court’s decision, it is 
time to threaten the Justices or pack 
the Court. When longstanding Senate 
rules threaten to frustrate far-left pro-
posals, it is the Senate rules they want 
to change. And now House Democrats 
want to try to use their slim majority 
to unilaterally rewrite and nationalize 
election law itself. They want to use 
the temporary power the voters have 
granted them to try to ensure they will 
never have to relinquish it. 
This year’s version of the House 
Democrats’ legislation contains the 
same bad ideas as their efforts 2 years 
ago. For example, when the Federal 
Election Commission was created after 
Watergate with the sensitive job of reg-
ulating American politics, it was de-
signed to require bipartisan consensus. 
House Democrats want to scrap those 
rules and turn the FEC from an even- 
numbered body, bipartisan body, to an 
odd-numbered partisan body so Demo-
crats can dominate it. Then they want 
to hand the newly partisan FEC new 
authorities to scrutinize and regulate 
an even wider share of political speech 
and private citizens’ activities. Or take 
election law itself—House Democrats 
have looked at the division and the dis-
unity of the last several months and 
decided that what American elections 
really need is a one-size-fits-all par-
tisan rewrite by one side here in Wash-
ington. 
In our country, States and localities 
run elections. Those of us in the Fed-
eral Government do not get a strangle-
hold over the ways in which voters de-
cide our fates. But House Democrats 
want to change that. Their bill would 
take prudential questions about early 
voting, registration, and no-excuse ab-
sentee balloting and resolve them one 
way for the entire Nation. They want 
to force all 50 States to allow the ab-
surd practice of ballot harvesting, 
where paid operatives can show up at 
polling places carrying a thick stack of 
filled-out ballots with other people’s 
names on them. They want to forbid 
States from implementing voter ID or 
doing simple things like checking their 
voter rolls against change-of-address 
submissions. They want to mandate 
no-excuse mail-in balloting as a perma-
nent 
norm, 
post-pandemic. 
And—I 
promise I am not making this up— 
their bill proposes to directly fund po-
litical campaigns with Federal tax dol-
lars. 
They 
want 
to 
raise 
money 
through new financial penalties, which 
the government would then use to fund 
campaigns and consultants. It is a 
strange idea. It takes a minute to kind 
of wrap your head around it. They want 
the Federal Government itself to send 
money for things like political ads that 
half the country disagrees with. What a 
bizarre concept that nobody is asking 
for. 
This 
sweeping 
Federal 
takeover 
would be exactly the wrong response to 
the distressing lack of faith in our elec-
tions that we have recently seen from 
both political sides. 
After both 2016 and 2020, we saw sig-
nificant numbers of Americans on the 
losing side express doubt in the valid-
ity of the result. As recently as late 
last September, fewer than half of 
Democrats said they were confident 
the 2020 election would be free and fair. 
Just weeks later, however, by mid-No-
vember, once things had gone the way 
they wanted, Democrats’ confidence in 
the election magically skyrocketed up 
to 90 percent. We cannot keep trending 
toward a future where Americans’ con-
fidence in elections is purely a function 
of which side won. 
A sweeping power grab by House 
Democrats, 
forcibly 
rewriting 
50 
States’ election laws, would shove us 
further and faster down that path. In 
this country, if the people who win 
elections want to hold on to power, 
they need to perform well, pass sound 
policies, and earn the support of the 
voters again. House Democrats do not 
get to take their razor-thin majority, 
which voters just shrunk, and use it to 
steamroll States and localities to try 
to prevent themselves from losing even 
more seats the next time. Protecting 
democracy cannot be a partisan issue. 
TRIBUTE TO JULIE ADAMS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
a completely different matter, this 
week, the institution of the Senate is 
losing a talented leader who has spent 
6 years as one of our top officials. 
The Secretary of the Senate is a 
truly unique position in American Gov-
ernment. She or he is essentially the 
chief administrative officer of the in-
stitution itself. Back in the 18th cen-
tury, that meant keeping the minutes 
and records and making sure people 
had ink for their quills. Today, it 
means managing a sprawling array of 
offices 
packed 
with 
career 
profes-
sionals, everything from parliamentary 
procedure to payroll, to public records, 
to the Senate Library and the page 
school and much more. The Secretary 
also fulfills key institutional func-
tions. She or he signs every act that we 
pass. They carry formal messages to 
other branches of our government. 
It takes major smarts, guts, integ-
rity, and people skills just to survive in 
this mammoth job, let alone to actu-
ally thrive in it, but for the last 6 
years, Julie Adams hasn’t just sur-
vived, 
she 
hasn’t 
just 
personally 
thrived; she has strengthened the en-
tire institution of the Senate. 
I first met Julie back in 2003 when we 
hired her to help out our press team. I 
was just starting my time as Repub-
lican whip. Julie was new to Wash-
ington, but she wasn’t new to policy or 
to politics, and she knocked everyone’s 
socks off right from the start. She 
combined diligence and professionalism 
with a heart of gold. She mastered her 
day job, volunteered for tasks above 
and beyond, and became the whole of-
fice’s favorite teammate. 
Of course, nobody is perfect; for ex-
ample, Julie is not a Kentuckian. She 
is a proud daughter of Iowa. But trust 
me, she has become an honorary cit-
izen of the Commonwealth many times 
over. 
A few years later, she was stolen 
away to do important work for First 
Lady Laura Bush, but in 2009, we 
brought her back to coordinate oper-
ations and administration across both 
my personal office and my leadership 
office. She brought great judgment, a 
quick mind, stellar instincts, and a me-
ticulous eye to a big job and made us 
all a whole lot better. From short-term 
crises to long-term relationships, Julie 
can do it all. 
While perpetually juggling 10 tasks 
for herself, she always found ways to 
look after everyone else. She made 
sure each of her colleagues, down to 
the most junior, got the attention and 
the resources they needed. Everyone 
was included. Everyone mattered. She 
made sure of it. 
Her talent and skills made Julie an 
easy choice for Secretary of the Senate 
after we took the majority in 2014. 
Now, there is always the potential for 
sensitivity when a new leader, ap-
pointed by a Senate leader of one 
party, comes in to oversee huge num-
bers of dedicated, long-serving, non-
partisan specialists. Not surprisingly,

February 25, 2021 
Julie rapidly won the admiration, af-
fection, and trust of the men and 
women under the Secretary’s umbrella. 
She has championed the professionals 
who make this place go. She empow-
ered them. She stuck up for them and 
made sure they were properly insulated 
from political pressure. 
Everyone knows Julie puts this insti-
tution and its rules first. Staff trust 
her. Senators on both sides trust her. 
Leaders across other branches of gov-
ernment trust her. She plays every-
thing down the middle with total in-
tegrity. 
And amid all of this, she maintained 
the generous spirit that everyone ad-
mires. Whether she is delivering offi-
cial Senate correspondence to the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court or the 
Secretary of State or checking in with 
a Senate employee on a birthday or 
during a tough personal time, everyone 
gets the same friendly ‘‘hello’’ and sin-
cere kindness from Julie Adams. 
Alas, it is customary to have a new 
Secretary of the Senate when there is a 
change in party control. Tomorrow is 
Julie’s last day. I am really, really 
sorry to say good-bye to such a key 
player. 
So on behalf of the whole Senate, I 
want to thank Julie’s proud parents, 
Dr. Harold and Leah Adams; her sib-
lings, John and Jessica; and her be-
loved canine companion Maggie for 
sharing this great friend and essential 
colleague with us for many years. 
Julie, you made your family proud, 
you made me proud, and, most impor-
tantly, you have been a great credit to 
this institution. Thank you, sincerely, 
for your service. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
AGRICULTURE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on Tues-
day, 
the 
Senate 
confirmed 
Tom 
Vilsack as the Secretary of Agri-
culture. It is a role he is familiar with, 
having 
previously 
served 
as 
Agri-
culture 
Secretary 
under 
President 
Obama. I voted in support of his nomi-
nation because I believe he understands 
the issues facing farmers and ranchers 
and is sincere in his desire to work 
with Members of Congress on both 
sides of the aisle to support our Na-
tion’s agriculture producers. 
Agriculture is the lifeblood of my 
home State of South Dakota, and 
fighting for farmers and ranchers is 
one of my top priorities here in the 
Senate. I am very pleased to, once 
again, serve on the Senate Agriculture 
Committee in this Congress, which 
gives me an important platform to ad-
vocate for South Dakota farmers and 
ranchers and farmers and ranchers 
across the country. 
One huge priority for me over the 
past year has been making sure agri-
culture producers have the support 
they need to weather this pandemic. 
During debate on the CARES Act—our 
largest coronavirus relief bill to date— 
I fought to make sure we included re-
lief for farmers and ranchers, and I fol-
lowed up by advocating for cattle pro-
ducers with the Department of Agri-
culture to make sure they would re-
ceive funds. 
I also worked to ensure that addi-
tional relief for farmers and ranchers 
was included in the COVID legislation 
that we passed in December. The 
Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 
that the USDA established to dis-
tribute funding, included in the CARES 
Act, has distributed billions in direct 
support 
to 
agriculture 
producers, 
which has been key in helping them 
weather this pandemic. 
Now that Secretary Vilsack has been 
confirmed, I urge him to lift the Biden 
administration’s freeze on part of this 
important program and distribute the 
additional funding from the December 
relief package as soon as possible. I 
also urge the Department of Agri-
culture to use its authority to provide 
assistance to agriculture processors 
like the biofuels industry. 
During my meeting with Secretary 
Vilsack prior to his confirmation, we 
spent time discussing my Soil Health 
and Income Protection Program, which 
became law as part of the 2018 farm 
bill. That program, the SHIPP pro-
gram, allows farmers to take their low-
est performing croplands out of produc-
tion for 3 to 5 years. This benefits the 
environment by increasing soil health 
and water quality, and it benefits farm-
ers by providing them with a rental 
payment for the acres they have tem-
porarily removed from production. 
I will continue to urge Secretary 
Vilsack to expand farmers’ access to 
SHIPP by holding another signup this 
year. I will also continue to urge him 
to address another priority I brought 
up in our meeting, and that is the No-
vember 1 haying and grazing date for 
cover crops on prevented plant acres, 
which is too late in the year for farm-
ers in more northern States like South 
Dakota. 
As I said, one of my top priorities has 
been making sure farmers and ranchers 
have the support they need during the 
pandemic. When it became clear that 
farmers and ranchers were largely 
missing out on the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program that Congress had set up 
to help small businesses weather the 
pandemic, Senator BALDWIN and I in-
troduced legislation to allow more 
farmers and ranchers to access the pro-
gram by allowing them to use their 
gross incomes rather than their net in-
comes to determine their loan awards. 
Our Paycheck Protection for Producers 
Act 
became 
law 
as 
part 
of 
the 
coronavirus relief bill that Congress 
passed in December. 
Senator BALDWIN and I have contin-
ued to engage with the Treasury De-
partment and the Small Business Ad-
ministration to ensure that the Pay-
check Protection Program is working 
properly for farmers and ranchers. For 
example, we recently led a bipartisan 
letter urging a broader implementation 
of our Paycheck Protection for Pro-
ducers Act to ensure that farmers and 
ranchers who are organized as partner-
ships or limited liability companies are 
allowed to apply for Paycheck Protec-
tion Program loans by using this more 
favorable gross income formula, as was 
intended. 
These issues are front of mind for ag 
producers in my State, and, last week, 
I had the opportunity to discuss many 
of them in person with representatives 
of the South Dakota Corn Growers As-
sociation, which represents and advo-
cates for corn farmers in South Da-
kota. Another thing we spent a lot of 
time talking about was biofuels. In ad-
dition to helping to feed our Nation, 
corn and soybean farmers provide es-
sential feedstocks for biofuels, like 
ethanol and biodiesel, which provide an 
important source of cleaner energy. I 
have long been an advocate for biofuels 
for their clean energy potential and the 
benefits they offer to the agriculture 
industry. 
When I met with Secretary Vilsack, 
he committed to working with me to 
promote ethanol as a form of clean en-
ergy—a commitment he echoed at his 
confirmation hearing. 
I recently introduced two bipartisan 
pieces of legislation to support the in-
creased use of biofuels and emphasize 
their 
clean 
energy 
potential. 
The 
Adopt GREET Act, which I introduced 
with Senator KLOBUCHAR, would re-
quire the Environmental Protection 
Agency to update its greenhouse gas 
modeling for ethanol and biodiesel by 
using the U.S. Department of Energy’s 
GREET model. A recent Harvard study 
found that ethanol is 46 percent cleaner 
than gasoline, with some technologies 
reducing life-cycle emissions by as 
much as 61 percent. These findings un-
derscore how biofuels can reduce emis-
sions in the near term using our Na-
tion’s 
existing 
vehicles. 
Currently, 
however, the EPA’s modeling does not 
fully recognize the tremendous emis-
sions-reducing potential of ethanol and 
other biofuels. The Adopt GREET Act 
would fix this problem and pave the 
way for increased biofuel use both here 
and abroad. 
I also introduced a bill to advance 
long-stalled biofuel registrations with 
the EPA. Regulatory inaction has sti-
fled the advancement of promising 
technologies, like ethanol derived from 
corn kernel fiber, even though some of 
these fuels are already being safely 
used in States like California. My bill 
would speed up the approval process for 
these innovative biofuels. This would 
allow biofuel producers to capitalize on 
the research and facility investments 
they have made and improve their op-
erating margins while further lowering

emissions and helping our Nation’s 
corn and soybean producers by rein-
forcing this essential market. 
The pandemic has highlighted vul-
nerabilities in our Nation’s food supply 
chain, especially when it comes to 
meat processing capacity. Too much of 
our Nation’s processing capacity is 
concentrated in a handful of facilities, 
leaving our meat supply vulnerable if a 
problem like a coronavirus outbreak 
occurs at one of these plants. 
I recently introduced the Strength-
ening Local Processing Act with Sen-
ator MERKLEY. Our legislation would 
help expand national meat processing 
capacity by providing new resources 
for smaller, more local meat processing 
operations. Spreading out and expand-
ing our Nation’s meat processing ca-
pacity over more plants will make our 
Nation’s meat supply less vulnerable to 
interruption in situations like the 
coronavirus pandemic or natural disas-
ters and provide livestock producers 
with more marketing options. 
I am proud to represent South Dako-
ta’s farmers and ranchers here in Con-
gress, and I will continue to do every-
thing I can to ensure that all of our Na-
tion’s farmers and ranchers have the 
support they need to weather the rest 
of this pandemic and to continue feed-

NOMINATION OF JENNIFER 
MULHERN GRANHOLM 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I am 
proud to stand today in support of Jen-
nifer Granholm’s nomination to be the 
next Secretary of Energy. 
I have known Secretary-designate 
Granholm for many years, and I served 
in her administration while she was 
Governor. There is no question she is 
uniquely qualified to serve as Sec-
retary of Energy. As the Governor of 
Michigan, she led our State through an 
economic crisis. She knows how to deal 
with multifaceted challenges and has a 
documented record of strong leader-
ship. 
During her confirmation hearing, 
Jennifer Granholm outlined three key 
missions that she wants to prioritize in 
her new role: one, strengthening na-
tional security, particularly on nuclear 
nonproliferation through the National 
Nuclear Security Administration; two, 
supporting the research and develop-
ment at scientific research facilities 
all across our Nation; and, three, uti-
lizing that research to create new, 
good-paying jobs for Americans. All of 
these issues are issues that Jennifer 
Granholm has been focused on through-
out her entire career. 
As Governor, she worked to support 
groundbreaking research that is con-
ducted at Michigan’s world-class insti-
tutions—research that is constantly 
leading to new discoveries that will 
change the world to create jobs and 
save 
lives. 
As 
Governor, 
Jennifer 
Granholm secured bipartisan support 
to establish the 21st Century Jobs 
Fund, which leveraged funding to di-
versify Michigan’s economy, create 
jobs in clean energy by attracting new 
business investments, and put Michi-
gan on a better path. 
Those are the kinds of actions and in-
vestments that I look forward to work-
ing closely with Secretary-designate 
Granholm on in the coming months 
and in the coming years, and it is clear 
that she also recognizes what must be 
done to advance our Nation’s energy 
interests, because she has already 
achieved results in Michigan. 
If we are going to build back better, 
we must do so in a sustainable, for-
ward-thinking way that addresses cli-
mate change. That is something Presi-
dent Biden’s administration is com-
mitted to doing, and I know Secretary 
Granholm is as well. I could not be 
more excited to say that we will have 
a fellow Michigander leading the De-
partment of Energy, and I urge all of 
my colleagues to support her confirma-
tion. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senator from West 
Virginia and I both be allowed to com-
plete our remarks before moving to the 
rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JENNIFER MULHERN GRANHOLM 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, when 
Governor Granholm came before the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee for her nomination hearing, she 
said she was committed to American 
energy dominance. She stated she un-
derstood the importance of having a 
broad energy mix and supporting en-
ergy innovation. 
Now, I asked her if it was a good 
thing that the United States is the 
world’s leading producer of oil and nat-
ural gas, and she said it was. I asked 
her if low energy prices and high-pay-
ing American energy jobs were good 
things, and she agreed that they were. 
And when I asked her if America ex-
porting its energy influence around the 
globe was a good thing, she again af-
firmed that it was. She has dem-
onstrated that she is dedicated to sup-
porting carbon capture, nuclear power, 
and American uranium production. 
For these reasons, she cleared our 
committee with broad bipartisan sup-
port and will soon be confirmed by the 
Senate. I expect we will work together 
closely on these efforts when she leads 
the Department of Energy. 
During her nomination hearing, Gov-
ernor Granholm also said that she 
didn’t want to see anyone lose their job 
or get left behind. Yet this is exactly 
what the Biden administration is doing 
to thousands of American energy work-
ers. 
On Inauguration Day, the President 
spoke of unity and bringing our Nation 
back together. Once he arrived at the 
White House, however, he threw that 
rhetoric out the window, picked up his 
pen, and started signing radical Execu-
tive orders. 
His orders to ban oil, gas, and coal 
leasing on Federal lands and to kill the 
Keystone XL Pipeline will throw thou-
sands of Americans out of work. These 
workers’ livelihoods are being sac-
rificed in the name of the Biden agen-
da. Leaders in the administration are 
telling these oil rig and coal mine and 
pipeline workers that they can simply 
get new jobs building solar panels. 
Actually, John Kerry said that the 
Biden administration policies will give 
these workers better choices. In 2019, 
the average salary of a solar panel 
technician was about $30,000 a year less 
than the average salary of a worker in 
the gas, oil, and coal industry. So John 
Kerry flies around the world, private 
jet, but is asking American energy 
workers to each take $30,000 a year less 
in income. And that is if these green 
energy jobs even exist. 
To that point, the Washington Post 
Fact Checker took a look at what John 
Kerry had said, and they said he was 
offering ‘‘false hope with a misleading 
use of statistics.’’ 
Look, we have heard it all before. 
When President Biden was Vice Presi-
dent, the Obama administration prom-
ised thousands of green energy jobs— 
jobs that never materialized. Millions 
of taxpayer dollars were wasted on 
green energy companies that went 
belly-up. 
Now the ‘‘Solyndra Syndrome’’ has 
returned. The Washington Post Fact 
Checker said it expects just a little 
over 10,000 new wind and solar jobs over 
the next 10 years. 
In Wyoming alone, the long-term 
leasing ban would result in 33,000 work-
ers losing their jobs. And where are 
these Wyoming workers supposed to 
go? 
Hundreds of thousands more workers 
are going to lose their jobs in New 
Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and other 
States. How will they provide for their 
families? 
The Biden ban won’t just hurt work-
ers; it is going to hurt kids too. A long- 
term leasing ban is going to eliminate 
hundreds of millions of dollars in State 
revenue—the dollars which go for es-
sential services, for public schools, for 
roads, bridges, and hospitals. A long- 
term leasing ban is going to hurt 
teachers, students, and the commu-
nities they call home. 
America needs all the energy—the 
oil, the gas, the coal, the uranium, the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S878 
February 25, 2021 
wind, the solar—all of them. Banning 
fossil fuels will hurt our economy and 
force more workers out of work. 
President Biden has declared war on 
American energy and American energy 
workers, and I just can’t stand by as 
this administration tries to crush Wyo-
ming’s economy. I can’t support an ad-
ministration that throws my constitu-
ents out of work and hurts the schools 
and the hospitals in the communities 
and the teachers who teach the chil-
dren. 
Energy is a force multiplier. Amer-
ican energy is—America is an energy 
superpower. We need to act that way. 
President Biden seems to want to 
pull the plug on American energy 
dominance. So I cannot in good con-
science vote to approve his nominee for 
Secretary of Energy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first, I 
ask unanimous consent that upon the 
disposition of the Granholm nomina-
tion, the Senate resume consideration 
of the Cardona nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JENNIFER MULHERN GRANHOLM 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of 
all, I am delighted to speak today on 
the nomination of Jennifer Granholm 
to be Secretary of Energy. 
I have known Jennifer since we were 
Governors together more than a decade 
ago. She served two terms as Governor 
of Michigan from 2003 to 2010. That was 
a particularly challenging time in her 
State’s history, and I saw how she han-
dled the difficult challenges facing her 
during the Great Recession and when 
the bottom dropped out of the auto in-
dustry in her State. 
She was up to those challenges. She 
helped save the domestic auto indus-
try. She diversified Michigan’s econ-
omy. She brought in new investment 
and new industry, and she created new 
jobs, leaving no worker behind. 
I know she will continue to apply the 
mindset at the national level. She has 
the leadership skills, the vision, and 
the compassion for people that we need 
at the helm of the Department of En-
ergy to face the climate challenge and, 
at the same time, preserve our energy 
security, protect our national security, 
clean up the Cold War legacy, and pre-
serve our scientific and technological 
prowess. 
Moreover, she is someone you can 
talk to and work with. She listens, and 
she is an honest broker. She may not 
always agree with you, but she will lis-
ten to your concerns and will try to ad-
dress them. 
Finally, she is just simply a good per-
son. That is a quality that I value and 
expect all of my colleagues would ben-
efit from. 
I believe she is extremely well quali-
fied to lead the Department of Energy, 
and I urge—I truly urge—all of my col-
leagues to show in this bipartisan vote 
to confirm her nomination today. 
I also yield back the remaining time 
of our presentation. 
VOTE ON GRANHOLM NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the 
Granholm nomination? 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

JOINT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON 
INAUGURAL CEREMONIES 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, on Janu-
ary 20, the world watched as we inaugu-
rated the 46th President of the United 
States on the west front of the Capitol, 
as we have done now for the last four 
decades. But this was the 59th time in 
our Nation’s history that we have gath-
ered to witness one of what has really 
become one of our most iconic and sa-
cred ceremonies. I described it that 
day, as President Reagan did 40 years 
earlier, as ‘‘commonplace and miracu-
lous.’’ Commonplace because we have 
done it every 4 years since 1789; mirac-
ulous because we have done it every 4 
years since 1789. 
This is the second time I have had 
the privilege to serve as the chairman 
of the Joint Congressional Committee 
on Inaugural Ceremonies or, as it is 
normally known, JCCIC, and that is 
how I will refer to it in the rest of 
these remarks. Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
the ranking member at that time on 
the Rules Committee, was a big part of 
helping with that, as were the other 
four members of that committee. 
In a normal year, organizing an inau-
guration is a major undertaking, but 
when you add a pandemic and then you 
add the events of January 6, it is 
uniquely challenging. Without a doubt, 
this was an inauguration of twists and 
turns, where adaptability, creativity, 
and determination were crucial. 
Today, I am here on the floor to 
thank the staff, the partners, and the 
volunteers who met those challenges 
and made this year’s inauguration a 
success. 
As I mentioned earlier, the two fac-
tors that posed the greatest challenges 
this year were the pandemic and secu-
rity. In order to keep the inauguration 
from becoming a superspreader event, 
we consulted with public health au-
thorities at the Johns Hopkins Center 
for Health Security and the Cleveland 
Clinic. We engaged experts from the 
National Football League, the Major 
League Baseball, NASCAR, the Na-
tional Hockey League, Disney, Ardian 
Group, and CLEAR about pandemic 
protocols and technology that relates 
to them. 
We were in regular consultation with 
the Office of the Attending Physician, 
particularly Dr. Monahan and his chief 
of staff, Keith Pray. And we relied on 
support from the Defense Health Agen-
cy and the Department of Health and 
Human Services’ COVID–19 Joint Com-
mand Cell. Testing was required for all 
attendees, and over 7,000 tests were ad-
ministered at two sites, one in the Cap-
itol and one in the Pentagon. 
Masks were required to be worn by 
all attendees. Graciously, Ford Motor 
Company produced a significant quan-
tity of masks, truly a first for this or 
any inauguration, and we are grateful 
to them, and 3M provided some special-
ized masks for the limited indoor ac-
tivities that we had. 
The health and safety measures put 
together 
really 
created 
significant 
logistical 
challenges. 
All 
of 
this 
couldn’t have been done without the 
leadership of Robin Mangan, our direc-
tor of operations for that health activ-
ity and that testing activity. Her team,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S879 
February 25, 2021 
Dr. Alex Lazar, who was on sabbatical 
from MD Anderson; Jordan Wilson was 
with us from ROB WITTMAN’s office; 
Shannon Ryder, detailed from the Cap-
itol Police Office of Emergency Man-
agement to help with that part of what 
we did. 
Security is always the foremost con-
sideration for an inauguration. It is a 
time of great exposure, frankly, for our 
democracy and our Nation’s leaders. 
And, as I said earlier, just 2 weeks 
earlier, the inaugural platform itself 
had been stormed and damaged. The of-
ficers who fought valiantly that day to 
protect the Capitol were also in charge, 
2 weeks later, with keeping the inau-
guration safe. And while carrying the 
burden of the events of January 6, the 
U.S. Capitol Police officers, with the 
assistance of the National Guard, en-
sured that the inauguration was secure 
and that the events of the day would 
occur without interruption. 
Our committee’s Capitol Police liai-
son, 
Lieutenant 
Jillian 
Jeffers, 
seamlessly coordinated the work of the 
JCCIC and the department’s Inaugural 
Task Force. I want to thank Lieuten-
ant Jeffers, the U.S. Capitol Police, 
and the Inaugural Task Force, along 
with the National Guard, and the en-
tire Executive Steering Committee, 
and law enforcement elements of this 
National Special Security Event for 
maintaining the security of the Capitol 
Complex during the inauguration. 
Because COVID significantly limited 
in-person participation, we had to put 
a particular emphasis on ensuring that 
people at home could also experience 
the inauguration. I believe we suc-
ceeded. Viewers of the 59th Inaugural 
Ceremonies totaled more than 108 mil-
lion people. The enhanced viewing ex-
perience provided by JCCIC was viewed 
by more than 75 million people across 
social media platforms and the com-
mittee’s website. This was more than 
double—surprising to me, at least—the 
viewership of the traditional national 
television news broadcast, which tal-
lied about 33.8 million people. In addi-
tion, the JCCIC was able to generate 
5.2 million individual impressions on 
Twitter, making it one of the bigger 
Twitter events ever. 
One of the most well-received aspects 
of the JCCIC production was the narra-
tion provided by two Capitol Visitor 
Center guides, Janet Clemens and Ronn 
Jackson, who described the various 
events through the day, offering view-
ers a behind-the-scenes experience that 
only somebody who spent day after day 
totally 
understanding 
the 
Capitol 
Building could have done. 
We appreciate the technical expertise 
and the creative insights offered us by 
industry 
professionals, 
like 
Gorilla 
Flicks 
and 
Razor 
Management, 
Showcall, Castle Technologies, and TRI 
Leadership Resources. All of those 
groups came together to help give us 
advice and assistance. 
I want to especially thank Paige 
Waltz, the JCCIC’s communications di-
rector. Paige was on loan from Senator 
ROMNEY, and her vigorous efforts to 
overhaul the JCCIC brand and the 
website and to realize innovative ways 
to make our ceremonies more inclusive 
for Americans and viewers around the 
world really paid off on inaugural day. 
I think we can all agree that Paige and 
her 
team—Spring 
Binsted, 
Corinna 
Schutte, Channing Foster, and Mat-
thew Mondello—outshined any expecta-
tions anybody would have had for what 
we were able to get across in this dif-
ferent kind of Inauguration Day. 
There was much to be seen on what 
we call ‘‘I-Day,’’ as the staff called it, 
and there is so much that we didn’t get 
a chance to see. The staff worked tire-
lessly in the background. That is the 
work we didn’t see—the months for 
some, weeks for others—to make the 
inaugural presentation seem like it 
was basically effortless, even though 
there was incredible effort. 
Jen Jett, on loan from Senator 
WICKER’s office, was our director of ad-
ministration 
and 
kept 
a 
master 
timeline, a lengthy document and in-
tricate task that allowed the President 
to be sworn in before noon, as required 
by the 20th Amendment to the Con-
stitution. We all watched President 
Biden take the oath of office at 11:48. 
Jen was ably assisted by Abby Stahl, 
who was the first to greet you when 
you called or visited the JCCIC offices, 
as we made preparations for this inau-
guration. 
Todd Beyer, our director of advance, 
made certain we all knew where to be 
and when to be there through all the 
ceremonies 
of 
the 
day. 
Jackson 
Blodgett skillfully supported those ad-
vanced efforts and facilitated an im-
mense undertaking of credentialed ac-
cess. 
Grace Higgins, hired to support our 
alternative plans for inclement weath-
er, instead became responsible for suc-
cessfully managing a complex tech-
nical solution and the integration of 
elaborate health screening processes to 
ensure everyone’s health safety. 
Sam Burke, most recently a Marine 
Corps Senate liaison officer, served as 
the JCCIC’s operation manager and 
military liaison, where he worked 
closely with the joint task force offi-
cials from the military district of 
Washington, who also played an incred-
ibly instrumental role on that day. 
Martha Scott Poindexter, now the 
Republican staff director of the Senate 
Agriculture Committee, served as our 
director 
of 
member 
services 
and 
ticketed and was responsible for assist-
ing Senators, Representatives, Gov-
ernors, 
foreign 
dignitaries, 
former 
Presidents, 
and 
former 
Members, 
frankly, as only she can, through the 
complexities of participating in this 
year’s ceremonies. 
Volunteers manager, Molly Harris 
Stevens, who was on loan from Rep-
resentative 
STAUBER, 
and 
Vincent 
Brown, on loan from Senator KLO-
BUCHAR’s Rules staff, recruited and 
managed 278 essential volunteers over 
months 
of 
unacknowledged 
tasks. 
Molly also helped design and imple-
ment a brandnew and seamless integra-
tion of our health and security oper-
ation, fielded by our volunteers. 
Without the volunteers, an inaugura-
tion would not be able to be carried 
out. We want to thank each of them, 
and the names of each of them I would 
like to be printed in the RECORD. 
I ask unanimous consent that those 
names be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Mr. BLUNT. While the JCCIC had to 
make the difficult decision to forgo a 
traditional congressional luncheon this 
year, we are grateful to partners like 
Korbel, Lenox, and the Smithsonian 
American Art Museum for working so 
closely with us on planning. 
Emily Kearney, the first person hired 
by the JCCIC, who early on worked 
with our partners at the Government 
Printing Office to design the tickets, 
invitations, and programs, is certainly 
to be commended for her work and to 
later coordinate and maintain the tra-
dition of gifts presented to the Presi-
dent and Vice President in the Capitol 
Rotunda. 
Lauren McBride, detailed from the 
House Sergeant at Arms to manage our 
exercises and rehearsals, expertly led 
our JCCIC team and core partners 
through a series of new ways to prepare 
for inclement weather, and she directed 
the massive undertaking of the dress 
rehearsal. 
There is also a small group of dedi-
cated staff who returned to support in-
auguration after inauguration: Celeste 
Gold, from Senator ROMNEY’s office; 
Michelle Reinshuttle, from the House 
Appropriations 
Committee; 
Tim 
Mitrovich from the Senate Sergeant at 
Arms returned to the JCCIC and once 
again loaned their experience to ben-
efit the ceremonies. 
Special thanks to Jen Daulby and 
Tim Monahan, the Republican staff di-
rector and deputy staff director, re-
spectively, of the Committee on House 
Administration, for their assistance in 
the inauguration’s performers and pro-
gram participants. 
I also want to thank the JCCIC staff 
representatives of our committee mem-
bers, my personal staff, and my Rules 
Committee staff, who, in addition to 
their normal duties, were also able to 
lend their considerable talents and ex-
pertise to the JCCIC. 
I especially want to thank Rules 
Committee staff Fitz Elder, who served 
as the dedicated staff director of the 
JCCIC, overcame the extraordinary 
challenges presented to the committee, 
and was undeniably paramount in the 
ultimate success of the ceremonies; 
Rachelle Schroeder, deputy staff direc-
tor; Jackie Barber, chief counsel; Cindy 
Qualley, chief clerk; and James Ferenc, 
director of information technology. 
Cami Morrison, the deputy inaugural 
coordinator, was once again respon-
sible for the organization of the Presi-
dential platform. She seated every sin-
gle person in attendance and made cer-
tain we were 6 feet apart or sitting 
right by somebody whom we sit by all 
the time. I am thankful for her tireless 
efforts, patriotic heart, and inaugural 
expertise. This was Cami’s fifth inau-
guration on the JCCIC staff. 
Maria Lohmeyer, chief of inaugural 
ceremonies—this is the second inau-
guration that I have asked Maria to 
take responsibility for, and she helped 
once again to plan and execute this in 
a way that I am very grateful for. I am 
glad she did it the first time and even 
more pleased she was willing to come 
back and do it again. Right before she 
joined us with JCCIC, she had been de-
ployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as 
part of her duties in the Navy Reserve. 
Maria, ever the determined profes-
sional, developed a plan and then an-
other plan and then another plan and 
then another plan. She built a staff and 
a positive culture in a really chal-
lenging time. She exceeded expecta-
tions and with determination made 
certain that democracy prevailed on 
January 20. 
Finally, I want to thank the Office of 
the House Chief Administrative Offi-
cer; the Appropriations Committee and 
especially the Legislative Branch Sub-
committee clerks, Jessica Berry and 
Lucas Agnew; Julie Adams and many 
of the behind-the-scenes staff in the Of-
fice of the Senate Secretary, especially 
Sydney 
Butler, 
Senator 
Curator 
Melinda Smith, and Senate Historians 
Betty Koed and Beth Hahn; and Clerk 
of the House Cheryl Johnson for lend-
ing the technical expertise of her com-
munication editorial staff, Catherine 
Cooke and January Layman-Wood. 
I want to thank Architect of the Cap-
itol Brett Blanton and his staff, who 
not only had to build a platform and 
put in a sound system, but they had to 
repair that platform and replace the 
sound system; from Brett Blanton’s 
staff, in particular Mark Reed, Jason 
McIntyre, 
Raynell 
Bennett, 
and 
Dwayne Thomas. 
I thank Acting House Sergeant at 
Arms Tim Blodgett and his staff, espe-
cially Ted Daniel and Davita Jones, 
and Acting Senate Sergeant at Arms 
Jennifer Hemingway and her staff, es-
pecially Becky Schaaf and Carly Flick. 
I also want to thank Acting Chief 
Pittman of the U.S. Capitol Police and 
in that case especially Inspector John 
Erickson, who commanded the ITF and 
took personal responsibility to safe-
guard our JCCIC staff. 
On January 20, 2021, the world wit-
nessed the 59th inaugural ceremonies— 
‘‘Our Determined Democracy: Forging 
a More Perfect Union’’—as a periodic 
event that has really become, as I said 
earlier, both commonplace and miracu-
lous. The inaugural ceremonies are not 
only a hallmark of American govern-
ance and democracy but also fulfill our 
constitutional duty and give assurance 
of our unbroken commitment to con-
tinuity, perseverance, and democracy. 
With great thanks to everybody men-
tioned and with tremendous coopera-
tion from Members of the House and 
Senate, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
wanted to join Senator BLUNT
in 
thanking the JCCIC staff. I see them 
up there, all 6 feet apart. They are in-
credible and did such a good job in a 
really difficult circumstance with this 
inauguration. 
I want to thank Senator BLUNT for 
his great leadership through thick and 
thin. There were a lot of hard decisions 
that had to be made, and he made the 
right ones. We worked together really 
well, and the sky was blue when the 
new President got inaugurated. Some-
how he pulled that off as well. So I 
thank the staff and thank Senator 
BLUNT for his friendship and his great 
leadership. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
U.S. POSTAL SERVICE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a lot of 
people are familiar with this saying. It 
goes like this: 
Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom 
of night shall [delay] these couriers from the 
swift completion of their appointed rounds. 
That is the motto of the U.S. Postal 
Service, inscribed on the buildings, and 
emblazoned in our memories of the du-
tiful work and awesome responsibility 
of the U.S. Postal Service throughout 
our history. 
I am proud of the Postal Service, and 
most Americans are as well. If you ask 
many people ‘‘What is your contact 
with the Federal Government, the U.S. 
Federal Government?’’ they might be 
hard-pressed to identify it, but when 
you mention the Postal Service, they 
say ‘‘Of course. Six days a week, my 
mailman, the person delivering the 
mail.’’ 
During the recent COVID–19 pan-
demic, many of us stayed home in our 
neighborhoods for lengthy periods of 
time. It became a routine that when 
the mailman came each day, as he did, 
we went out to greet him with masks

February 25, 2021 
on and chatted for just a moment or 
two. 
It was a tough assignment. They 
were no longer showing up at 2 p.m. in 
the afternoon as usual but sometimes 7 
and 8 o’clock at night. They kept up 
with their responsibility. 
I say that because I want to preface 
these remarks by letting everyone 
know that I am proud of the Postal 
Service. I will fight to keep it in busi-
ness serving America, and I know that 
it is going through extreme hardship at 
the present time. 
But 2 nights ago, I was on a town 
meeting call with Alderman Leslie 
Hairston of the Fifth Ward in Chicago. 
She asked me to come on the call be-
cause of the problems that she is hav-
ing in the Hyde Park area. She wanted 
me to hear some of the situations that 
they were facing in the Fifth Ward. 
The U.S. Postal Service, unfortu-
nately, is a lifeline that is being 
threatened at the current time. So 
many people in Chicago and all across 
the country depend on it for regular, 
prompt mail service to deliver every-
thing from birthday cards to bills, 
cards, checks, and medicine. Yet, for 
months now, mail delivery has been 
slow and unpredictable for millions of 
Americans. 
I have heard from many Chicago-area 
residents, just like I heard the other 
night, and small businesses that have 
gone upwards of a month—a month— 
without the delivery of mail. These 
delays are having a devastating impact 
on the lives of families in my State. 
One Chicago man said that after re-
ceiving no mail for 3 weeks, he went to 
the local post office to check where his 
mail was. He waited in line for 6 hours 
before he finally was given his mail. 
Another woman wrote me that she wor-
ries that missing bills will hurt her 
credit rating, making it even harder 
for her to make ends meet. Another 
woman wrote that she worries that 
missing bills will hurt not only her 
credit rating but could hurt her person-
ally by denying basic prescriptions and 
medicine that she counts on. Small 
business owners are losing customers 
because their mail-order deliveries are 
delayed or just flat disappear. 
But this vivid example that brings 
these together is the story of Ms. 
Carmella McCoy Gonzalez. She has a 
disability. She is unable to travel real-
ly much outside her home—restrictions 
that have become even more con-
straining during the pandemic. Ms. 
McCoy Gonzalez suffers from high 
blood pressure and a heart condition, 
making her regular delivery of medica-
tion essential. However, she reports 
that for the past few months, she and 
her neighbors are lucky if they get 
mail delivered one day a week. She 
told my office that a shipment of medi-
cine sent on February 8 didn’t reach 
her home until February 23, while oth-
ers just simply didn’t arrive at all. 
When they reached out to the local 
post office, they were told that they 
wouldn’t be getting any mail because 
there weren’t enough carriers to de-
liver it. In fact, a report from the Post-
al Service Office of the Inspector Gen-
eral in early February found that the 
reason there weren’t enough postal car-
riers to deliver the mail is that the ad-
ministrators just hadn’t bothered re-
moving the names of employees who no 
longer worked there. This meant they 
weren’t able to bring in additional staff 
when needed to deliver a growing back-
log of delayed mail. 
The report noted that more than 
60,000—60,000—pieces of mail had been 
delayed in Chicago neighborhoods over 
a period of several weeks. These delays 
are not new, and they are certainly not 
confined to Chicago. U.S. Postal Serv-
ice customers in many States have en-
dured delays and other problems with 
mail service for months. Veterans are 
going without medication that has 
been mailed to them from the VA. 
Small businesses are missing delivery 
dates. Families are missing paychecks 
and not receiving notices of premiums 
due in time. 
Timely, reliable mail delivery is al-
ways important, and it is especially 
critical now. Receiving medications 
and other important deliveries enables 
people to stay safely at home rather 
than to venturing out and risking 
COVID infections. 
Regular mail service helps sustain 
the economy during an unprecedented 
public health crisis by providing a low- 
cost shipping option for small busi-
nesses that are struggling to survive. 
Yet, rather than focusing on how to fix 
the current delivery delays, U.S. Postal 
Service leaders are now considering 
changes that could result in higher 
prices and even more delays. This is no 
plan to fix the Postal Service; it is a 
plan to sabotage the Postal Service in 
order to benefit its commercial com-
petitors. 
Cut service, raise prices, then lose 
customers because you cut services and 
raised prices, and then just repeat that 
destructive cycle again and again until 
there are little or no customers left— 
that is the plan of the Postal Service 
under Postmaster General DeJoy, and 
Congress needs to step in. We must de-
mand that the Postmaster General im-
plement new policies and operational 
changes immediately to end delivery 
delays in Chicago and across the coun-
try. Congress needs to ensure the Post-
al Service has all the resources and 
tools it needs to provide reliable and 
affordable services during this critical 
time and to come out of this pandemic 
on secure financial footing. 
Our Founders understood that reli-
able and affordable mail service was es-
sential to our economy and our na-
tional unity. The Postal Service is the 
one public service that is so important 
that it is actually mentioned by name 
in the Constitution. We cannot allow 
its temporary custodians, appointed by 
the previous administration, to kill it 
with a death of a thousand cuts in 
order to enrich private competitors, es-
pecially during this pandemic. 
This situation is grave and serious. 
For a lot of people, the delay of a day 
or two in receiving mail is just an in-
convenience; for others, it could be a 
matter of life or death literally when 
so many medicines are moving through 
the mail, prescriptions and medica-
tions that people count on for their 
livelihood. And it really is something 
that has been so fundamental in Amer-
ica. 
We have to ask the basic question: 
What is going on here? I am happy to 
report that yesterday the Biden admin-
istration announced that they were ap-
pointing three new Governors to fill 
three vacancies on the Postal Board of 
Governors. Those vacancies have been 
too long in festering and creating the 
situation we have today. 
The Postmaster General, Mr. DeJoy, 
who came to this position in con-
troversy when he started suggesting he 
was going to delay the delivery of bal-
lots in the previous election of Novem-
ber 3, is adamant that he is going to 
continue on his mission. We have to in-
tervene on behalf of the people whom 
we represent and on behalf of this 
country. 
I stand by the Postal Service. I be-
lieve in the men and women who make 
it work. And everyone I have met—cer-
tainly in my neighborhood and the 
ones who have been coming to my 
home over the years—almost became a 
part of the family. I knew all about 
their families and some of the prob-
lems and wonderful things that were 
happening in their lives. That was part 
of the experience, the postal experi-
ence, in smalltown America that we 
want to preserve. But when it comes to 
the big cities, we have to be sensitive 
to that as well. When massive amounts 
of mail are being held in trailer trucks 
behind the post office, not being sorted 
and delivered, it is just absolutely, 
positively unacceptable. 
If COVID–19 among the workforce is 
one of the reasons, let’s address that 
directly—in terms of vaccinations, No. 
1; in terms of replacement employees 
or temporary employees, No. 2; what-
ever it takes to keep the Postal Service 
at the highest quality. 
I urge my colleagues, when you go 
home, if you are hearing the same sto-
ries about the U.S. Postal Service, let’s 
make this a bipartisan response. Fami-
lies and businesses and vulnerable indi-
viduals across America are counting on 
us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
REMEMBERING MAXINE HORNER 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in 
1932, 11 years after the Tulsa Race Mas-
sacre, Maxine Horner was born in 
Tulsa, OK. She was Maxine Cissel at 
the time. She grew up in segregated 
Greenwood, a district recovering from 
the devastating effects of the massacre, 
just a little over a decade before. 
Her parents were exceptionally pro-
tective and instructed Maxine and her 
siblings not to go into certain stores in

downtown Tulsa, knowing their chil-
dren wouldn’t be welcome. They didn’t 
want their children to experience the 
pain and humiliation of being told to 
leave a store or to not sit at that end 
of the counter. 
Her mother once told her, though: 
Never let the color of your skin get in the 
way of achieving your goals. If you put your 
mind to it, you can do anything and be any-
one. 
Maxine was part of the first class to 
graduate from Booker T. Washington 
High School, which, at the time, was 
an all-Black school. She was proud of 
the education she received at Booker 
T. and spent 2 years studying at Wiley 
College before returning back to Tulsa. 
She got a job working for Congress-
man James Jones, an opportunity that 
sparked some political ambitions in 
her. In her fifties, she returned back to 
school and received a bachelor’s degree 
from Langston University in 1985. De-
spite being decades older than her fel-
low classmates and occasionally being 
mistaken to be the professor in her 
class rather than one of the other stu-
dents, she finished her education. 
In 1986, she ran for the Oklahoma 
State Senate and became one of two 
women to be elected for the first time 
into the Oklahoma State Senate as an 
African American. 
Maxine was a true trailblazer. She 
worked hard for her constituents, and 
she championed education and the arts. 
Her life was full of some poetic jus-
tice, quite frankly. She grew up in the 
Greenwood District in the wake of the 
Tulsa Race Massacre, but in the late 
1990s, she sponsored the State legisla-
tion that created the Tulsa Race Riot 
Commission. She also cofounded the 
Greenwood Cultural Center. After she 
left office, she continued to fight for 
the 
victims 
of 
the 
massacre 
and 
chaired the committee overseeing the 
search for the burial sites—work that 
is still going on today. 
As a young teen, she recalls going 
into the Tulsa Union Depot and seeing 
drinking fountains labeled ‘‘Colored’’ 
and ‘‘White.’’ But as a State senator, 
she sponsored the legislation that cre-
ated the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame, 
which now occupies the old Tulsa 
Union Depot building, where they don’t 
have 
drinking 
fountains 
labeled 
‘‘Black’’ or ‘‘Colored’’ and ‘‘White.’’ 
As a student, she attended segregated 
schools. As a Senator, she championed 
the Oklahoma Higher Learning Access 
Program or what we now call Okla-
homa’s Promise—a scholarship pro-
gram for low and middle-income stu-
dents in Oklahoma. Oklahoma’s Prom-
ise helped over 75,000 young Oklaho-
mans pursue higher education. She left 
quite a legacy. 
Two weeks ago, on February 8, Okla-
homa lost this transformational giant. 
Maxine Horner passed away at the age 
of 88, and she will be certainly missed 
by her families, and she will be missed 
by Oklahoma. 
REMEMBERING VICKI MILES-LAGRANGE 
Mr. President, I did mention that in 
1986 she was one of two ladies who were 
African American who were elected in 
the State senate that year—the first 
ladies who were African American to 
be elected into our State senate. The 
other lady was a dear friend, Vicki 
Miles-LaGrange. She is younger. She 
was born in 1953 in a segregated hos-
pital in Oklahoma City. 
She grew up in a loving home with 
her parents and older sister. Her par-
ents were well-respected educators in 
Oklahoma City. They both got their 
master’s degrees from the University of 
Oklahoma in 1955, just 7 years after 
Ada Lois Sipuel won her case at the 
Supreme Court to allow Black Oklaho-
mans to even attend the University of 
Oklahoma. 
As a young girl, she was interested in 
government. And when her friend’s 
mother, Hannah Atkins, decided to run 
for the Oklahoma House of Representa-
tives, Vicki helped out, even as a teen-
ager. She became what they put to-
gether 
called 
Hannah’s 
Helpers, 
a 
group of young people who campaigned 
for Hannah Atkins. And Atkins won 
her race and became the first Black fe-
male to serve in the Oklahoma House 
of Representatives. 
Vicki 
attended 
McGuinness 
High 
School. She stayed involved in a little 
bit of politics there, participating in 
Girls State. Asking a mutual friend, 
Patrick McGuigan, who I am convinced 
had a crush on her when they were in 
high school—asking Patrick about that 
time, he recounts the stories and has 
written even in some of his writings 
about how Vicki went to Girls State 
and was elected governor of the Okla-
homa Girls State Program that year, 
but when the sponsoring organization 
decided who they were going to send to 
Girls Nation, they for the first time did 
not send the governor; they chose to 
send the lieutenant governor. That is 
what Vicki faced as she grew up. 
She attended Vassar College, and at 
18 became a delegate at the Democratic 
Oklahoma State Convention. It was 
there that she met Carl Albert, who 
told her that if she ever ended up in DC 
to look him up and to come work for 
him. Well, that is all you would have to 
tell Vicki. She attended Howard Uni-
versity Law School, walked right into 
the Speaker of the House’s office one 
day here at the Capitol and convinced 
Carl Albert that he should remember 
his offer, and she became an intern in 
his office immediately while she pur-
sued her law degree. 
This was not an unusual thing for 
Vicki. After graduating law school, she 
clerked for a Federal judge in Houston, 
joined the criminal division of the De-
partment of Justice, where she helped 
prosecute Nazi war criminals. 
In 1983, she decided she wanted to re-
turn to Oklahoma. So she returned, 
though she was rejected for an office in 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office—ironic be-
cause later she became the U.S. attor-
ney for the Western District. She 
walked right into the district attor-
ney’s office, Bob Macy’s office, resume 
in hand, no appointment, and asked to 
be able to speak with him. And she 
waited outside of his office until he 
came out of his office. He came out for 
lunch and walked out with a job offer 
after that. 
In 1986, she decided to run for State 
senate. This was the same year Maxine 
ran as well. Her dad, a former indus-
trial arts teacher, helped fix up her 
campaign headquarters. Her mother 
and her mother’s best friend were her 
campaign managers, and she won that 
race and unseated Senator Porter, a 22- 
year incumbent. 
When you look at Vicki’s life, there 
are a lot of firsts. Along with Maxine 
Horner, she was the first African- 
American female to be elected to the 
Oklahoma State Senate. In 1993, she 
became 
the 
first 
African-American 
woman to become the U.S. attorney for 
the Western District of Oklahoma. A 
year later, in 1994, President Clinton 
appointed her to be the U.S. district 
judge for the Western District of Okla-
homa. She was the first African-Amer-
ican Federal judge among the six 
States that make up the Tenth Circuit 
of that Federal jurisdiction. 
She was appointed by Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist in the U.S. Supreme 
Court as a member of the International 
Judicial Relations Committee of the 
Judicial 
Conference 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
Shortly after, when she became a 
Federal judge, the horrific genocide un-
folded in Rwanda. Vicki advocated for 
an independent judiciary in Rwanda 
and was part of a group of inter-
national legal experts who were sent to 
Rwanda to help reform the system. She 
made eight trips to Rwanda at her own 
personal risk. In 2006, she was awarded 
the Fern Holland Courageous Lawyer 
Award from the Oklahoma Bar Asso-
ciation. 
In 2013, she was inducted into the 
Oklahoma Hall of Fame, the highest 
honor an Oklahoman can receive for 
their contributions to the State. 
She received many other awards, in-
cluding the Oklahoma Bar Associa-
tion’s Women Trailblazer Award. 
In the early 1960s, she was so inspired 
by President Kennedy’s inaugural ad-
dress that she wrote to him to say how 
happy she was that he was President. 
One of his advisers actually wrote her 
a letter back. She kept that letter, 
and, in fact, she hung it in her office 
while she was a judge. She was quoted 
as saying that, above all else, she is a 
career public servant. There was a 
newspaper article when she took her 
very last case in 2018 as a Federal 
judge, and it quoted back to 1994 when 
she was in front of this Senate for con-
firmation hearings, being the first Afri-
can-American judge ever in the Tenth 
Circuit. And she said this: 
My race will not determine my decisions. 
She said: I don’t want to be known as 
a good Black judge. I want to be a re-
spected and good and fair judge. 
Vicki Miles-LaGrange, that is ex-
actly how we remember you. 
Oklahoma is proud of these two la-
dies and what they have done. We are

proud to call them fellow Oklahomans 
in the trailblazing that they have done. 
Thanks for your leadership. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, we are all 
representative of heroes and idols and, 
clearly, my colleague from Oklahoma 
appoints several out from his home 
State. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that I complete my remarks be-
fore we go to the vote this afternoon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A. CARDONA 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise 
today to support the nomination of 
Miguel Cardona to be the next Sec-
retary of Education. He has the back-
ground, qualifications, and the tem-
perament to serve in this position. Dr. 
Cardona has a meteoric rise from a 
classroom teacher to a school prin-
cipal, to a commissioner of education 
for the State of Connecticut. 
I am glad the President has nomi-
nated him to lead the Education De-
partment in such a challenging time 
for our Nation’s schools. 
COVID–19 
related 
school 
closures 
have led to significant learning losses, 
with millions of children stuck at 
home, trying to learn. Parents are at 
their wits’ end because many of the 
adults running public schools across 
our country are failing to actually fol-
low the science. We should be seriously 
talking about reopening schools as 
quickly as possible. That is what the 
science tells us, and that is what stu-
dents need. 
Dr. Cardona testified before the Sen-
ate HELP Committee. He stressed the 
need for students to get back to school, 
and I am glad that is now, finally, a bi-
partisan mission. 
At the same time, each school dis-
trict, college, university, State and 
local community faces different cir-
cumstances in dealing with this pan-
demic. Trying to treat them as a mono-
lith instead of providing flexible advice 
for States and localities to use if appli-
cable and useful would be a mistake. 
Dr. Cardona said he understands that 
one-size-fits-all mandates from Wash-
ington won’t work. Dr. Cardona also 
agreed to be responsive to our over-
sight requests and to keep us updated 
on his plans and Department action. 
We won’t agree on everything, but we 
should be able to find places where we 
can agree and we can move forward. 
I support the nomination of Dr. 
Cardona and look forward to working 
with him, and I encourage my col-
leagues to support his nomination as 
well. 
SECURITY 
Mr. President, on a personal note, it 
is time to take the fences down around 
this Capitol. To leave them up—it is 
not about security. It is about an at-
tempt to say: We are really, really im-
portant. We work here. 
Let me say what I think most of my 
colleagues believe. We aren’t. We are 
like everyone whom we represent and 
whom Lincoln referred to as common 
folks. 
At one time, this was a shining city 
on a hill, and today we have made it 
into a bunker on the Hill. The message 
that sends globally, the message that 
it sends domestically, is wrong. It is 
time for us to take these 4,000 national 
guardsmen and let them go see their 
families versus for 24 hours a day to pa-
trol when we don’t even provide them a 
cafeteria that is open at night. They 
eat out of vending machines or they 
bring what they eat. 
We thank all of these individuals for 
the safety they have provided us after 
a horrendous January 6 event. Now it 
is past time for us to open up this cam-
pus and to allow DC, the District of Co-
lumbia, to fully open up to the tourism 
that they thrive off of. 
I thank the President for his indul-
gence. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session for a 
period of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
MOMMA ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week America reached a heartbreaking 
milestone, one that would have seemed 
unthinkable a year ago. We have now 
lost more than 500,000 Americans to the 
COVID–19 pandemic. That is one in 
every five COVID–19 deaths in the 
world. We have lost mothers and fa-
thers, sisters and brothers, friends, 
neighbors, and coworkers. On Monday 
evening, President Biden, Vice Presi-
dent Harris, and their spouses remem-
bered all of these lost souls in a moving 
ceremony at the White House. Behind 
them, 500 flickering candles lined the 
White House stairs, each candle rep-
resenting a thousand lives cut short by 
the virus, a thousand grieving families. 
In addition, more than 28 million 
Americans have been infected by the 
coronavirus in this pandemic 
No State, no community in America, 
has been spared in this sadness. In my 
State of Illinois, COVID–19 has claimed 
more than 20,000 lives. My heart goes 
out to and every American trying to 
survive in this terribly difficult year. I 
have heard others say, and I agree: 
This pandemic will not break us, but it 
is showing us where we are bro-
ken.Like so many other diseases and 
health conditions, the pandemic has in-
flicted disproportionate harm on peo-
ple and communities of color—Black 
Americans, 
Native 
Americans, 
and 
members of the Latinx community. 
Black Americans get sick and die of 
COVID at 1.5 times the rate of White 
Americans. Despite their greater risks 
of infection and death, people of color 
are receiving COVID vaccinations at 
less than half the rate as White Ameri-
cans. In Illinois, Black residents make 
up 15 percent and Latinx residents 
make up 18 percent of our State’s popu-
lation, yet each group accounts for

only 8 percent of the COVID vaccines 
allocated so far. 
Sadly, these statistics come as no 
surprise. America has a long history of 
medical inequality. From premature 
births to premature deaths, people of 
color suffer disproportionately from 
America’s troubled health care system. 
People of color in America suffer more 
chronic and acute health conditions. 
They are more likely to go without 
needed medical care, and they have 
shorter life expectancies. According to 
new estimates from the CDC, life ex-
pectancy in the United States fell by a 
full year as COVID–19 swept through 
the Nation last year—the steepest de-
cline in life expectancy since World 
War II. Again, the pain was unequal. 
Latinx Americans’ life expectancy de-
clined by 2 years and Black Americans’ 
by 3 years. The reasons for the dispari-
ties are many and varied, but they in-
clude unequal access to affordable 
healthcare, inadequate research, and 
too few healthcare professionals of 
color. 
Martin Luther King called healthcare 
inequality ‘‘the most shocking and in-
humane’’ form of injustice. Far too 
often, this inequality begins even be-
fore birth. It should shock our con-
sciences that the United States, one of 
the wealthiest nations on Earth, has 
one of the world’s poorest records for 
maternal and infant health. Think of 
this: The United States is one of only 
13 nations in the world where the ma-
ternal mortality rate is worse now 
than it was 25 years ago. Every year in 
America, nearly 1,000 women die from 
pregnancy-related complications and 
70,000 others suffer near-fatal complica-
tions as a result of pregnancy. Now 
consider this: Women of color in the 
United States are three times more 
likely than White women to die as a re-
sult of their pregnancy. In Illinois, 
they are six times as likely to die. 
What makes these maternal deaths 
even more tragic is that an estimated 
60 percent of them are preventable. The 
same is true of many infant deaths. 
Every year in America, more than 
23,000 infants die due to factors that, in 
many cases, could be prevented. Among 
the 35 wealthiest nations in the world, 
the United States ranks 32nd in infant 
mortality. Again, the risks are un-
equal. Black babies are twice as likely 
to die in their first year of life as White 
babies. 
I have given a lot of thought and spo-
ken with many experts about how we 
can bridge this racial divide. This 
week, I am reintroducing a bill with 
Senator DUCKWORTH that I believe can 
decrease America’s rates of maternal 
and infant sickness and deaths, espe-
cially among those of color. It is called 
the MOMMA Act. My companion in the 
House is Congresswoman ROBIN KELLY 
of Chicago. She and I have introduced 
this bill for the last two Congresses. It 
is time to make it law. 
First and foremost, the MOMMA Act 
would expand Medicaid coverage for 
new moms from 60 days to a full year 
postpartum. Making sure new moms 
have health coverage for a full year 
postpregnancy will go a long way to-
ward catching, preventing, and treat-
ing potentially life-threatening condi-
tions and problems. This is critical be-
cause in some States—like Illinois— 
nearly 60 percent of pregnancy-associ-
ated deaths occur between 43 and 364 
days postpartum. Many States’ Med-
icaid Programs, including Illinois’s are 
strapped for cash, and the pandemic 
has increased their shortfalls. In addi-
tion, our bill would provide States with 
guidance and options to expand their 
Medicaid coverage to include doulas, 
who are often invaluable assets and ad-
vocates for pregnant women. Next, our 
bill would save lives by improving 
health care education and training to 
reduce the unconscious biases and dis-
crimination that woman of color too 
often encounter from healthcare pro-
fessionals. Lastly, our bill would im-
prove hospital coordination and report-
ing on maternal health outcomes. Ac-
curate reporting will enable us to chart 
our progress and make adjustments 
where and when they are needed. 
Among the women at greatest risk of 
pregnancy-related 
health 
complica-
tions are women who are incarcerated. 
Again, the risks for Black women are 
greater. To help these mothers and 
their babies, Senator BOOKER
and I 
have introduced a separate bill. The 
Justice for Incarcerated Moms Act 
helps incarcerated pregnant women 
and new mothers with access to doulas 
and other health workers, as well as 
counseling, because a jail sentence 
should never be a death sentence for a 
mother or her newborn. As the poet 
Maya Angelou told us, we can’t change 
the past. But when we know better, we 
must do better. We now know how we 
can do better to protect the lives of 
pregnant women and newborn babies. I 
urge my colleagues to join us in sup-
porting these two important measures 
to give mothers and babies the healthy 
start in life that they deserve.

mittee. Subpoenas for attendance of wit-
nesses and the production of memoranda,

perience, qualifications, and suitability, to 
serve in the position to which he or she has 
been nominated. To aid in such investigation 
or review, each nominee may be required to

Rule 13. Announcement of Hearings.—The

written testimony. Having submitted his 
written testimony, the witness shall be al-
lowed not more than ten minutes for oral

written testimony, but must confine their 
oral presentation to a summarization of 
their arguments. 
(c) Witnesses shall observe proper stand-
ards of dignity, decorum, and propriety while 
presenting their views to the committee. 
Any witness who violates this rule shall be 
dismissed, and his testimony (both oral and 
written) shall not appear in the record of the 
hearing. 
(d) In scheduling witnesses for hearings, 
the staff shall attempt to schedule witnesses 
so as to attain a balance of views early in 
the hearings. Every member of the com-

are not allowed. Persons creating confusion 
or distractions or otherwise disrupting the 
orderly proceeding of the hearing shall be ex-
pelled from the hearing.

erage is desired. 
(b) If such approval is granted, broad-
casting coverage of the hearing shall be con-
ducted unobtrusively and in accordance with 
the standards of dignity, propriety, courtesy, 
and decorum traditionally observed by the 
Senate. 
(c) Equipment necessary for coverage by 
television and radio media shall not be in-
stalled in, or removed from, the hearing 
room while the committee is in session. 
(d) Additional lighting may be installed in 
the hearing room by the media in order to 
raise the ambient lighting level to the lowest 
level necessary to provide adequate tele-
vision coverage of the hearing at the then 
current state of the art of television cov-
erage. 
(e) The additional lighting authorized by 
subsection (d) of this rule shall not be di-
rected into the eyes of any members of the 
committee or of any witness, and at the re-
quest of any such member or witness, offend-
ing lighting shall be extinguished. 
Rule 17. Subcommittees.—(a) The chair-
man, subject to the approval of the com-
mittee, shall appoint legislative subcommit-
tees. The ranking minority member shall 
recommend to the chairman appointment of 
minority members to the subcommittees. All 
legislation shall be kept on the full com-
mittee calendar unless a majority of the 
members present and voting agree to refer 
specific legislation to an appropriate sub-
committee. 
(b) The chairman may limit the period dur-
ing which House-passed legislation referred 
to a subcommittee under paragraph (a) will 
remain in that subcommittee. At the end of 
that period, the legislation will be restored 
to the full committee calendar. The period 
referred to in the preceding sentences should 
be 6 weeks, but may be extended in the event 
that adjournment or a long recess is immi-
nent. 
(c) All decisions of the chairman are sub-
ject to approval or modification by a major-
ity vote of the committee.

majority vote of those members present dis-
charge a subcommittee from further consid-
eration of a specific piece of legislation. 
(e) The chairman and ranking minority 
members shall serve as nonvoting ex officio

NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A. 
CARDONA 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak in support of Dr. 
Miguel Cardona’s nomination to serve 
as Secretary of Education and to urge 
my colleagues to confirm him to this 
position. 
Dr. Cardona will bring a deep under-
standing of the needs of students and 
teachers, a firm grasp of our edu-
cational system, and a fresh perspec-
tive to the Department of Education. 
Dr. Cardona was the first in his im-
mediate family to go to college. He is 
the father of two school-aged children, 
and he brings to this role decades of ex-
perience as an educator, having served 
as an elementary school teacher, prin-
cipal, and assistant superintendent. 
Throughout his career, Dr. Cardona 
has worked tirelessly to improve the 
lives of students. He has fought to 
make sure college is accessible for all 
students. As the education commis-
sioner for the State of Connecticut, he 
was on the frontlines helping his state 
tackle the complex issues facing their 
schools during the pandemic. 
In his opening statement before the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions 
Committee, 
Dr. 
Cardona 
re-
affirmed his commitment to forging 
opportunity out of crisis. He also rec-
ognized the need to address educational 
inequities head-on and build a better 
future for the next generation. 
He has the track record to show he 
understands the value of education and 
knows how to get things done. Under 
Dr. Cardona’s leadership, Connecticut 
became the first State in the Nation to 
ensure that all of its public school stu-
dents had access to a laptop and a 
high-speed internet connection to en-
gage in remote learning during the 
pandemic. At another point in Dr. 
Cardona’s career, he led a task force to 
help figure out how to close the aca-
demic achievement gap among stu-
dents in his State. 
The value of education is something 
that is personal to me. 
My grandpa worked 1,500 feet under-
ground in the mines of Ely, and he 
never graduated from high school, but 
he knew the value of a quality edu-
cation, saving money in a coffee can in 
the basement to send my dad to col-
lege. 
My dad graduated from Vermilion 
Community College and earned his 
graduate degree in journalism from the 
University of Minnesota. He went on to 
be a sports reporter and a newspaper 
columnist. 
My mom was a public school teacher 
who taught second grade until she was 
70 years old. She loved teaching. Her 
favorite unit was the monarch but-
terfly unit, where we would dress up as 
a monarch butterfly, and she would 
teach the kids about metamorphosis. 
She would also wear that monarch but-
terfly costume to the supermarket. She 
was dressed as this big monarch but-
terfly with little antennas on her head 
and a sign that said ‘‘to Mexico or 
bust’’ because that is where the mon-
arch would fly on its way from Canada 
through Minnesota and down. 
At the visitation on the night before 
my mom’s funeral, I met a family. I 
had never met them before, but the 
mom was sobbing, and she had an older 
son who had a severe disability. The 
mom said, ‘‘You know, your mom had 
my son here in school when he was in 
second grade. Now he was grown up, 
and he said he always loved that mon-
arch butterfly unit. And after he grad-
uated, he got a job bagging groceries, 
and your mom would continue to go to 
the grocery store and she would stand 
in line in her monarch butterfly outfit. 
For years she did this, and would al-
ways give him a big hug when she got 
to the end of the line.’’ That was my 
mom, and she loved her kids, and she 
was a devoted teacher. 
I learned the value of education from 
my parents and grandparents, and I be-
lieve that it is a basic right that we 
have in this country that every child 
should have a right to education. I 
know that Dr. Miguel Cardona also be-
lieves in that right, and this is why I 
support his confirmation as Secretary 
of Education. I will also note that sev-
eral of my Republican colleagues, in-
cluding Senator BURR, ranking member 
on the HELP Committee, have come to 
the same conclusion. 
This past year has been like no other, 
filled with tremendous challenges for 
students, educators, and families. As a 
result of this pandemic, parents have 
had to teach their first graders how to 
use the mute button to go to school. 
The crisis has taken a toll on the men-
tal health of students and educators. 
There is major work to do to make 
sure that all students can catch up on 
lost learning caused by gaps in access 
to technology and broadband during 
the pandemic. 
Thankfully, there is now light at the 
end of the tunnel with the development 
and distribution of vaccines that pro-
tect against the coronavirus and stand 
to save millions of lives. Our country 
now faces important decisions about 
how to safely and equitably return to 
in-person learning, and we need strong, 
thoughtful leadership to help guide 
these decisions and get our country 
back up and running. That means lead-
ership we can trust to provide guidance 
that is driven by science and by public 
health experts. It also means leader-
ship that will support the rights of all 
students to have a full and enriching 
educational experience.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S888 
February 25, 2021 
I believe that Dr. Cardona will be a 
Secretary who will fight for public edu-
cation, not against it; a Secretary who 
takes seriously the Federal Govern-
ment’s role in making education pol-
icy, informed by the most rigorous 
science; perhaps most of all, a Sec-
retary who fosters compromise, not 
conflict, in addressing our Nation’s 
many educational challenges. 
As one of my mentors Senator Paul 
Wellstone put it, government should 
work to improve people’s lives, and we 
have a lot of work to do with so many 
students and families in need. But I 
come to this Chamber today optimistic 
because our country has had a long and 
strong history of stepping up during 
challenging times like these. I look 
forward to partnering with Dr. Cardona 
to meet the needs of this moment and 
overcome the obstacles we face to sup-
port students, teachers, and schools as 
we work to recover from this pandemic 
and move forward. 
With that, I ask my colleagues to 
support 
the 
nomination: 
Miguel 
Cardona as Secretary of Education.

TRIBUTE TO JANE HARMAN 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise to recognize the extraordinary 
service of my friend Representative 
Jane Margaret Lakes Harman, who will 
be leaving her position as president and 
CEO of the Woodrow Wilson Inter-
national Center for Scholars after 
nearly a decade of distinguished leader-
ship. 
Born in New York City, Representa-
tive Harman grew up in Los Angeles 
and received her bachelor’s degree 
magna cum laude from Smith College 
and her law degree from Harvard Law 
School. Like many young people who 
believe in the unmatched power of pub-
lic service, Jane moved to Washington, 
DC, where she served as a staffer to 
Senator John Tunney and with the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee. 
She 
would go on to serve her country in the 
Department of Defense and as Presi-
dent Carter’s Secretary of the Cabinet. 
From 1993 until 2011, Representative 
Harman served the people of Southern 
California’s 36th District. Throughout 
her tenure, Representative Harman 
fundamentally improved the national 
security of the United States through 
her work on the Armed Services, Intel-
ligence, and Homeland Security Com-
mittees. Not content with leading just 
from the halls of Congress, she sought 
to find the truth for herself. Her work 
in pursuit of the facts relevant to pro-
tecting our democracy and our allies 
took her to Guantanamo Bay, Syria, 
and North Korea. Her oversight and 
leadership on national security was es-
pecially critical throughout this time 
period, as the United States sought to 
understand and push back from threats 
both new and old, including foreign ter-
rorism. While Representative Harman’s 
contributions speak for themselves, her 
receipt of the Defense Department 
Medal for Distinguished Service, the 
CIA Seal Medal, the CIA Director’s 
Award, and the National Intelligence 
Distinguished Public Service Medal 
highlight an extraordinary career serv-
ing the American people. 
At the Wilson Center, Representative 
Harman continued her diligent work 
keeping our policymakers and the pub-
lic informed on the ongoing security 
challenges the United States and her 
allies face. As we prepare and steel our-
selves for the next era of security chal-
lenges, knowledge produced under her 
leadership and the relentless efforts of 
her colleague and staff will continue to 
be an invaluable resource. 
Like many extraordinary Americans, 
Representative Harman carried out 
this work while also caring for her 
family, including her four children, her 
four grandchildren, and her late hus-
band Sidney, an enormous personality 
in his own right. After a lifetime of 
public service, from staffer to elected 
official to thought leader in the policy- 
making 
community, 
Representative 
Jane Harman has left an indelible 
mark that has deeply strengthened the 
safety of our Nation. I am forever 
grateful for her service, her friendship, 
and wish her all the best in her next 
adventures.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
CHAROLETTE 
TID-
WELL AND RECOGNIZING ANTI-
OCH FOR YOUTH AND FAMILY 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the hard work and dedi-
cation of Ms. Charolette Tidwell and 
her organization, Antioch for Youth 
and Family, in Fort Smith, AR. This 
nonprofit, all-volunteer organization 
has played an important role in feeding 
local families for several years, but its 
efforts in 2020 made it a critical lifeline 
for thousands of people in western Ar-
kansas. 
Last year alone, Antioch distributed 
more than 3.5 million pounds of food, 
including almost 1 million pounds of 
fresh produce, milk, dairy, and cooked 
meats provided by the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture Coronavirus Food As-
sistance Program. By hosting regular 
drive-up events at Martin Luther King 
Park in Fort Smith, Ms. Tidwell and 
her team provided help to families who 
needed it most during the COVID–19 
pandemic. In 2020, their efforts meant 
more than $6 million worth of food 
went to local residents, making it one 
of the largest food assistance efforts in 
the State. More than one in six house-
holds in Arkansas is food insecure. In 
Fort Smith, that number is one in five. 
Unfortunately, the current crisis has 
only increased those needs. 
I have been honored to visit with Ms. 
Tidwell and see her impressive efforts 
to fill the gap in her community in ac-
tion. Before the pandemic, she was al-
ready hard at work with a food pantry, 
a community garden, and mobile food 
deliveries to low-income elderly and 
disabled residents and other struggling 
families. 
She has been an inspiration whose 
work has been recognized nationwide. 
L’Oreal Paris honored her in 2017 as 
one of 10 Women of Worth and in 2020 
with the L’Oreal Paris Karen T. Fondu 
Impact Award for her tireless efforts to 
address the area’s hunger crisis. Last 
year, she was featured on bags of Lay’s 
potato chips as part of the company’s 
initiative featuring ordinary people 
who do extraordinary things. 
Those awards and acknowledgements 
speak to the nature of her impact and 
the vital role she plays within the com-
munity. Fortunately, she has once 
again dedicated herself to meeting a 
tremendous need with the same com-
passion and care she brings to every 
challenge. 
I am grateful for Ms. Tidwell, the en-
tire team at Antioch for Youth and 
Family, and their wonderful partners. 
With support from the River Valley Re-
gional Food Bank, Feeding America, 
local businesses, and many volunteers, 
Antioch continues to make a difference 
and set an example for organizations 
across the State and the Nation.∑

TRIBUTE TO VERNIS JACKSON 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize Vernis Jackson of 
Portsmouth 
as 
February’s 
Granite 
Stater of the Month. Jackson is the 
founder of the Seacoast African Amer-
ican Cultural Center and played a crit-
ical role in establishing the African 
Burying Ground in downtown Ports-
mouth. 
Jackson moved to Portsmouth from 
her hometown of Savannah, GA, in 1963 
and in 1974 joined another Granite 
Stater in organizing the first chartered 
organization, 
Kwanza, 
for 
African- 
American women in New Hampshire. 
The group worked to support young 
people and communities on the Sea-
coast; however, Jackson felt that there 
was more that she could do to elevate 
African-American achievements in the 
State. 
In 2000, Jackson founded the Sea-
coast African American Cultural Cen-
ter, which holds concerts, educational 
programs, and exhibits to help high-
light the contributions, both modern 
and historical, that individuals of Afri-
can descent have made to communities 
on the Seacoast and around the world. 
Jackson, who taught for 38 years in 
the Portsmouth school system, wanted 
to make sure that the center could be 
used as a resource for students. Thanks 
to Jackson’s leadership, the center 
works 
closely 
with 
schools 
across 
Portsmouth, including holding art ex-
hibits for middle school students and 
providing scholarships for high school 
students of color. 
In 2016, the center featured an exhibit 
featuring dolls of color, and last year it 
hosted an exhibit showcasing photos 
from former President Barack Obama’s 
White House photographer Pete Souza. 
Jackson also helped lead efforts in 
Portsmouth to establish the African

resents the best of New Hampshire’s ef-
forts to create a more informed, inclu-

of all people and backgrounds. I am

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and 
Ms. STABENOW): 
S. 448. A bill to amend title XXI of 
the Social Security Act to prohibit 
lifetime or annual limits on dental cov-
erage under the Children’s Health In-
surance Program, and to require wrap-
around coverage of dental services for 
certain children under such program; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss two bills addressing 
oral health, which I am introducing 
today. These bills will provide incen-
tives for dental and dental hygiene 
graduates to remain as dental school 
faculty and make the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP) more afford-
able for at-risk patients and families. 
We rely on dental faculty to train the 
next generation of oral health pro-
viders, but too often, these educators 
find themselves pushed to work in pri-
vate practice in order to pay off their 
student loans. The Dental Loan Repay-
ment Assistance Act will ease some of 
this financial burden and allow faculty 
members to stay where they are needed 
most by eliminating certain loan as-
sistance benefits from counting as tax-
able income. For low-income children, 
the CHIP program provides access to 
affordable oral health care. The Ensur-
ing Kids Have Access to Medically Nec-
essary Dental Care Act makes oral

health more affordable by eliminating 
annual and lifetime dollar limits for 
dental care provided under CHIP and 
requires that CHIP wraparound dental 
coverage be the same as dental cov-
erage for CHIP enrollees. 
The 
ongoing 
novel 
coronavirus 
(COVID–19) pandemic has decreased ac-
cess to oral health care. Though pa-
tient volumes have improved since last 
spring, recent surveys from the Amer-
ican Dental Association (ADA) indicate 
that since August many private prac-
tices have been operating at around 80 
percent of pre-COVID–19 patient vol-
umes while public health practices 
have been operating at around 60 per-
cent of pre-COVID–19 patient volumes. 
Patients nationwide have experienced 
restrictions throughout the pandemic 
impeding their ability to visit health 
professionals like oral health practi-
tioners, while dental practices have ex-
perienced financial difficulties brought 
on by the pandemic. Increases in oper-
ating costs to enable safe operations, 
such as purchasing personal protective 
equipment (PPE), have strained dental 
practices’ financial resources. These 
added costs, coupled with reduced pa-
tient volume, have led to nearly 60 per-
cent of dental practices applying or 
planning to apply for small business 
loans under the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP). 
As patients and providers alike cur-
rently struggle with oral health access 
issues, it is critical that the pandemic 
not compound access to care inequi-
ties. In particular, these challenges are 
cause for concern for at-risk popu-
lations such as communities of color, 
who experienced oral health disparities 
before the pandemic began. As families 
and patients nationwide struggle to ac-
cess care at this incredibly challenging 
time, I am introducing these two bills 
to ease the financial burden of dental 
professionals and promote increased 
access to oral health for low-income 
beneficiaries. 
There are nearly 6,500 dental health 
professional shortage areas nationwide. 
These are areas where nearly 60 million 
Americans, including 835,000 Maryland-
ers, struggle to find a dental provider, 
even with insurance coverage. By 2030, 
the Department of Health & Human 
Services 
(HHS) 
projects 
that 
the 
United States will have a national 
shortage of 16,000 dentists. We can only 
hope to solve this problem if we can re-
cruit and retain enough faculty to 
train the next generation of dentists 
and dental hygienists. Crippling edu-
cational debt should not prevent our 
Nation from having the oral health 
care providers it needs, and the Dental 
Loan Repayment Assistance Act will 
help address that 
I would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to acknowledge that February 
is National Children’s Dental Health 
Month. Since 1981, this month has af-
forded us the opportunity to acknowl-
edge the importance of children’s den-
tal health. We recognize the significant 
strides we have made, but we also ac-
knowledge the work that remains to be 
done. I invite my colleagues to join me 
to use this month to renew our com-
mitment to ensuring that all children 
in our country have access to afford-
able and comprehensive dental serv-
ices. As former U.S. Surgeon General 
C. Everett Koop said, ‘‘there is no 
health without oral health.’’ 
Tooth decay—despite being largely 
preventable—is the single most com-
mon chronic health condition among 
children and adolescents in the United 
States. It is four times more common 
than 
early-childhood 
obesity, 
five 
times more common than asthma, and 
20 times more common than diabetes. 
Among children in families living 
below the federal poverty line, 52 per-
cent have cavities. Children with cav-
ities in their primary or ‘‘baby’’ teeth 
are three times more likely to develop 
cavities in their permanent, adult 
teeth, and the early loss of baby teeth 
can make it harder for permanent 
teeth to grow in properly. If tooth 
decay is untreated, it not only can de-
stroy a child’s teeth; it can have a de-
bilitating impact on his or her health 
and quality of life. 
Many of my colleagues have heard 
me speak before about the tragic loss 
of Deamonte Driver, a 12–year-old 
Prince George’s County resident, in 
2007. Deamonte’s death was particu-
larly heartbreaking because it was en-
tirely preventable. What started out as 
a toothache turned into an abscess and 
then severe brain infection that an $80 
extraction could have prevented. After 
multiple surgeries and a lengthy hos-
pital stay, Deamonte tragically passed 
away—fourteen years ago and just a 
few miles from where we gather here in 
the Senate Chamber. 
Even in less tragic cases, tooth and 
gum pain can impede a child’s healthy 
development, including the ability to 
learn, play, and eat nutritious foods. 
Recent studies have shown that chil-
dren with poor oral health are nearly 
three times more likely to miss school 
due to dental pain, and children report-
ing recent toothaches are four times 
more likely to have a lower grade point 
average than their peers who do not 
suffer from dental pain. Tooth decay 
and oral health problems also dis-
proportionately affect children from 
low-income families and minority com-
munities. According to the National 
Institutes of Health, approximately 80 
percent of childhood dental disease is 
concentrated in 25 percent of the popu-
lation. These children and families 
often face inordinately high barriers to 
receiving essential oral health care 
and, simply put, the consequences can 
be devastating. 
In 2009, Congress reauthorized the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program 
with an important addition: a guaran-
teed pediatric dental benefit. Today, 
CHIP provides affordable comprehen-
sive health coverage—including dental 
coverage—to more than 9 million chil-
dren. Thanks to CHIP, we now have the 
highest number of children with med-
ical and dental coverage in history. In 
addition, in 2010, Congress included pe-
diatric dental services in the set of es-
sential 
health 
benefits 
established 
under the Affordable Care Act. I am 
pleased to say that our actions have 
been working, and our numbers are im-
proving. In 2004, nearly 23 percent of all 
children had untreated tooth decay. In 
2016, that number had dropped to 13 
percent. 
I am very proud that my State of 
Maryland is recognized as a national 
leader in pediatric dental health cov-
erage. In a 2011 Pew Center report, 
‘‘The 
State 
of 
Children’s 
Dental 
Health,’’ Maryland earned an ‘‘A’’ and 
was the only State to meet seven of 
eight policy benchmarks for addressing 
children’s dental health needs. In addi-
tion, in the Maryland Health Benefit 
Exchange, very qualified health plan 
now includes pediatric dental coverage, 
so families do not have to pay a sepa-
rate premium for dental coverage for 
their children and do not have a sepa-
rate deductible or out-of-pocket limit 
for pediatric dental services. 
I am also proud to say that Maryland 
Medicaid does not place a lifetime or 
annual limit on pregnant women or 
children 
receiving 
dental 
benefits 
under CHIP. This ensures that preven-
tive 
dental 
care 
like 
exams 
and 
cleanings, fillings, crowns, root canals, 
and dentures are not out of reach for 
low-income Marylanders because of 
cost constraints. This benefit is criti-
cally important nationwide as millions 
of Americans have joined Medicaid in 
the past year due to the pandemic. 
Not every State has the same benefit 
structure for CHIP as Maryland, how-
ever, which means that new and exist-
ing Medicaid beneficiaries may have 
limits on the types of services they can 
access. As we know from the terribly 
tragic example of Deamonte Driver, no 
family or child should ever face cost 
constraint decisions for basic oral 
health care. This is why I have intro-
duced the Ensuring Kids Have Access 
to Medically Necessary Dental Care 
Act, to protect access to oral health 
care for millions of CHIP and Medicaid 
enrollees and ensure that the pandemic 
does not reverse the progress we have 
made in oral health. 
I urge my colleagues to join the sen-
ior 
Senator 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
WICKER) and me in supporting the Den-
tal Loan Repayment Assistance Act to 
help address our critical nationwide 
shortage of dental healthcare providers 
and especially dental faculty. We can-
not continue to allow crippling grad-
uate student debt to deprive the Amer-
ican people of the teachers and men-
tors we need to train the next genera-
tion of oral healthcare providers. I 
similarly urge my colleagues to join 
the senior Senator from Michigan (Ms. 
STABENOW) and me in supporting the 
Ensuring Kids Have Access to Medi-
cally Necessary Dental Care Act to im-
prove access to oral health care for 
low-income 
beneficiaries. 
We 
must 
learn from the tragic example of

By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. WARNER): 
S. 470. A bill to authorize the Sec-
retary of the Interior to conduct a 
study to assess the suitability and fea-
sibility of designating certain land as 
the Great Dismal Swamp National Her-
itage Area, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Environment and 
Public Works. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing a bill to assess the fea-
sibility of establishing a National Her-
itage Area in the Great Dismal Swamp, 
as part of an effort to study, recognize, 
and preserve the historic and natural 
treasures within this region. 
As we continue to celebrate Black 
History Month, this bill underscores 
the ties between the natural landmark 
and African American history. The 
Great Dismal Swamp contains one of 
the largest collections of artifacts from 
maroon colonies, and it served as both 
a home for early colonial Free People 
of Color as well as one of a few known 
water-based stops for freedom seekers 
on the Underground Railroad. The 
Great Dismal Swamp also encompasses 
historic and ancestral lands of Native 
American 
tribes 
such 
as 
the 
Nansemond Indian Nation and the 
Haliwa-Saponi and Meherrin Tribes. 
Today, the Dismal Swamp offers 
unique educational opportunities, rec-
reational 
adventures, 
and 
environ-
mental benefits. It is an important 
wildlife refuge for an impressive and 
diverse list of animal, insect, and plant 
species. If designated as a National 
Heritage Area, local communities will 
have access to technical assistance and 
advice from the National Park Service 
while maintaining full ownership, au-
thority 
over 
decision-making, 
and 
stewardship of the biodiverse land. 
I am pleased to be joined by my col-
league Senator MARK WARNER on this 
bill, and I am thankful to Congressman 
DONALD MCEACHIN’s leadership on this 
effort in the House with Representa-
tives BOBBY SCOTT, G.K. BUTTERFIELD, 
and ELAINE LURIA. There is great po-
tential for community and economic 
development stemming from a Na-
tional Heritage Area designation. I

look forward to such grassroots, com-
munity-driven development, and plan 
to personally contribute to the boosted 
tourism and recreation. As a student of 
history I am looking forward to learn-
ing more from the trove of culture and

I encourage the Senate to consider 
this 
legislation 
to 
help 
highlight, 
study, and conserve the unique ecology 
and cultural history contained in the 
Great Dismal Swamp for generations 
to come.

Mr. 
LANKFORD, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI, Mr. KAINE, and Mr. WARNER) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 76 
Whereas people in the United States de-
pend on civil servants to carry out the im-
portant work of the Federal Government, in-
cluding— 
(1) civilian defense employees who support 
and equip the United States Armed Forces; 
(2) doctors and nurses who care for vet-
erans returning home from war; 
(3) cybersecurity professionals who protect 
critical infrastructure and respond to emerg-
ing threats; 
(4) scientists and researchers who respond 
to pandemics and develop new cures for dis-
eases; 
(5) Federal law enforcement and intel-
ligence officers who protect the United 
States from foreign and domestic threats to 
its physical security; 
(6) prosecutors and judges who uphold the 
laws; 
(7) prison guards who keep violent crimi-
nals off the streets; 
(8) postal workers who keep communities 
connected and the economy churning; 
(9) benefit officers and administrators who 
deliver important Federal retirement and 
health benefits; and 
(10) revenue agents who ensure the United 
States has the necessary funds to carry out 
the work described in paragraphs (1) through 
(9); 
Whereas the National Active and Retired 
Federal Employees Association (referred to 
in this preamble as the ‘‘NARFE’’) was 
founded in 1921 as the Association of Retired 
Federal Employees to defend and advance 
the retirement benefits of civil servants who 
serve the United States in honor of their 
service; 
Whereas NARFE serves a critical function 
in promoting the general welfare of the civil 
servants who serve the United States by de-
livering valuable guidance, timely resources, 
and powerful advocacy relating to the earned 
pay and benefits of the civil servants; 
Whereas NARFE is a trusted source of 
knowledge for the Federal community, Con-
gress, the executive branch, and the media; 
Whereas NARFE, a leading voice in Wash-
ington and across the country, advocates 
tirelessly on behalf of the Federal commu-
nity with the support of grassroots activists 
in every State and congressional district; 
Whereas NARFE provides both Federal 
workers and retirees with clear, reliable, and 
accessible counsel to navigate the unique 
and complex issues relating to their benefits 
so they can make critical decisions and gain 
confidence in a secure future; and 
Whereas NARFE represents more than 
170,000 Federal employees, retirees, and their 
survivors: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates and honors the National 
Active and Retired Federal Employees Asso-
ciation (referred to in this resolution as the 
‘‘NARFE’’) on the celebration of its 100th an-
niversary; 
(2) commends the civil servants who serve 
the United States for their outstanding con-
tributions to the United States;

viduals of the United States to contribute to 
the society, economy, and citizenry of the 
country; 
Whereas 90 percent of children in the 
United States attend public schools; 
Whereas Federal, State, and local law-

age, and lead school districts and schools in 
partnership with educators, parents, and 
other local education stakeholders; and

State and local funds, supports the access of 
students to inviting classrooms, well-pre-
pared educators, and services to support 
healthy students, including nutrition and 
afterschool programs;

TION 6—URGING THE ESTABLISH-

OF 
A 
UNITED 
STATES 
COMMISSION ON TRUTH, RACIAL 
HEALING, 
AND 
TRANS-
FORMATION 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BROWN, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. COONS, Mr. MENENDEZ, 
Mr. 
MERKLEY, 
Mr. 
SANDERS, 
Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR, Mr. DURBIN, and Mr. PADILLA) 
submitted the following concurrent 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. CON. RES. 6 
Whereas the first ship carrying enslaved 
Africans to what is now known as the United 
States of America arrived in 1619; 
Whereas that event 400 years ago was sig-
nificant not only because it ushered in the 
institution of chattel slavery of African 
Americans, but also because it facilitated 
the systematic oppression of all people of 
color that has been a devastating and insuffi-
ciently understood and acknowledged aspect 
of our Nation’s history over those past 400 
years, and that has left a legacy of that op-
pression that haunts our Nation to this day; 
Whereas the institution of chattel slavery 
in the United States subjugated African 
Americans for nearly 250 years, fractured our 
Nation, and made a mockery of its founding 
principle that ‘‘all men are created equal’’; 
Whereas the signing of the Constitution of 
the United States failed to end slavery and 
oppressions against African Americans and 
other people of color, thus embedding in so-
ciety the belief in the myth of a hierarchy of 
human value based on superficial physical 
characteristics such as skin color and facial 
features, and resulting in purposeful and per-
sistent racial inequities in education, health 
care, employment, Social Security and vet-
eran benefits, land ownership, financial as-
sistance, food security, wages, voting rights, 
and the justice system; 
Whereas that oppression denied oppor-
tunity and mobility to African Americans 
and other people of color within the United 
States, resulting in stolen labor worth bil-
lions of dollars while ultimately forestalling 
landmark contributions that African Ameri-
cans and other people of color would make in 
science, arts, commerce, and public service; 
Whereas Reconstruction represented a sig-
nificant but constrained moment of advances 
for Black rights as epitomized by the Freed-
man’s Bureau, which negotiated labor con-
tracts for ex-enslaved people but failed to se-
cure their own land for them; 
Whereas the brutal overthrow of Recon-
struction failed all individuals in the United 
States by failing to ensure the safety and se-
curity 
of 
African 
Americans 
and 
by 
emboldening States and municipalities in 
both the North and South to enact numerous 
laws and policies to stymie the socio-
economic mobility and political voice of 
freed Blacks, thus maintaining their subser-
vience to Whites; 
Whereas Reconstruction, the civil rights 
movement, and other efforts to redress the 
grievances of marginalized people were sabo-
taged, both intentionally and unintention-
ally, by those in power, thus rendering the 
accomplishments of those efforts transitory 
and unsustainable, and further embedding 
the racial hierarchy in society; 
Whereas examples of government actions 
directed against populations of color (re-
ferred to in this resolution as ‘‘discrimina-
tory government actions’’) include— 
(1) the creation of the Federal Housing Ad-
ministration, which adopted specific policies 
designed to incentivize residential segrega-
tion; 
(2) the enactment of legislation creating 
the Social Security program, for which most 
African Americans were purposely rendered 
ineligible during its first 2 decades; 
(3) the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 
1944 (commonly known as the ‘‘G.I. Bill of 
Rights’’; 58 Stat. 284, chapter 268), which left 
administration of its programs to the States, 
thus enabling blatant discrimination against 
African American veterans; 
(4) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 
which allowed labor unions to discriminate 
based on race; 
(5) subprime lending aimed purposefully at 
families of color; 
(6) disenfranchisement of Native Ameri-
cans, who, until 1924, were denied citizenship 
on land Native Americans had occupied for 
millennia; 
(7) Federal Indian Boarding School policy 
during the 19th and 20th centuries, the pur-
pose of which was to ‘‘civilize’’ Native chil-
dren through methods intended to eradicate 
Native cultures, traditions, and languages; 
(8) land policies toward Indian Tribes, such 
as the allotment policy, which caused the 
loss of over 90,000,000 acres of Tribal lands, 
even though two-thirds of that acreage was 
guaranteed to Indian Tribes by treaties and 
other Federal laws, and similar unjustified 
land grabs from Indian Tribes that occurred 
regionally throughout the late 1800s and into 
the termination era in the 1950s and 1960s; 
(9) the involuntary removal of Mexicans 
and United States citizens of Mexican de-
scent through large-scale discriminatory de-
portation programs in the 1930s and 1950s; 
(10) the United States annexation of Puer-
to Rico, which made Puerto Ricans citizens 
of the United States without affording them 
voting rights; 
(11) racial discrimination against Latino 
Americans, which has forced Latino Ameri-
cans to fight continuously for equal access 
to employment, housing, health care, finan-
cial services, and education; 
(12) the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to execute 
certain treaty stipulations relating to Chi-
nese’’, approved May 6, 1892 (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Chinese Exclusion Act’’; 22 
Stat. 58, chapter 126), which effectively halt-
ed immigration from China and barred Chi-
nese immigrants from becoming citizens of 
the United States, and which was the first 
instance of xenophobic legislation signed 
into law specifically targeting a specific 
group of people based on ethnicity; 
(13) the treatment of Japanese Americans, 
despite no evidence of disloyalty, as suspect 
and traitorous in the very country they 
helped to build, leading most notably to the 
mass incarceration of Japanese Americans 
beginning in 1942; 
(14) the conspiracy to overthrow the King-
dom of Hawaii and annex the land of the 
Kingdom of Hawaii, without the consent of 
or compensation to the Native Hawaiian peo-
ple of Hawaii; and 
(15) the United States history of colo-
nialism in the Pacific, which has resulted in 
economic, health, and educational dispari-
ties among other inequities, for people in 
United States territories, as well as inde-
pendent nations with which the United 
States has treaty obligations; 
Whereas those discriminatory government 
actions, among other government policies 
that have had racially disparate impacts, 
have 
disproportionately 
barred 
African 
Americans and other people of color from 
building wealth, thus limiting potential cap-
ital and exacerbating the racial wealth gap; 
Whereas research has shown that the per-
sistent racial wealth gap has had a signifi-
cant negative impact on other racial dispari-
ties, such as the achievement gap, disparities 
in school dropout rates, income gaps, dis-
parities in home ownership rates, health out-
come disparities, and disparities in incarcer-
ation rates; 
Whereas United States civic leaders and 
foundations have spearheaded critical efforts 
to advance racial healing, understanding, 
and 
transformation 
within 
the 
United 
States, recognizing that it is in our collec-
tive national interest to urgently address 
the unhealed, entrenched divisions that will 
severely undermine our democracy if they 
are allowed to continue to exist; 
Whereas many of the most far-reaching 
victories for racial healing in the United 
States have been greatly enhanced by the in-
volvement, support, and dedication of indi-
viduals from any and all racial groups; 
Whereas at the same time, much of the 
progress toward racial healing and racial eq-
uity in the United States has been limited or 
reversed by our failure to address the root 
cause of racism, the belief in the myth of a 
hierarchy of human value based on super-
ficial physical characteristics such as skin 
color and facial features; 
Whereas the United States institution of 
slavery, as well as other examples enumer-
ated in this resolution, represent intentional 
and blatant violations of the most basic 
right of every individual in the United 
States to a free and decent life; 
Whereas the consequences of oppression 
against people of color have cascaded for 
centuries, across generations, beyond the era 
of active enslavement, imperiling for de-
scendants of slaves and other targets of op-
pression what should have otherwise been 
the right of every individual in the United 
States to life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness; 
Whereas more than 40 countries have reck-
oned with historical injustice and its after-
math through forming Truth and Reconcili-
ation Commissions to move toward restora-
tive justice and to return dignity to their 
citizens; 
Whereas for 3 decades there has been a 
growing movement inside and outside Con-
gress to have the Federal Government de-
velop material remedies for the institution 
of slavery, including through a Commission 
to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals

BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE BOARD 
OF DIRECTORS OF THE OFFICE 
OF CONGRESSIONAL WORKPLACE 
RIGHTS 
U.S. CONGRESS,
OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL
WORKPLACE RIGHTS, 
Washington, DC, February 25, 2021 
Hon. PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President Pro Tempore, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Section 102(b) of the 
Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 
(CAA) requires the Board of Directors of the 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights 
(OCWR) to biennially submit a report con-
taining recommendations regarding Federal 
workplace rights, safety and health, and pub-
lic access laws and regulations that should 
be made applicable to Congress and its agen-
cies. The purpose of this report is to ensure 
that the rights afforded by the CAA to legis-
lative branch employees and visitors to Cap-
itol Hill and district and state offices remain 
equivalent to those in the private sector and 
the executive branch of the Federal Govern-
ment. As such, these recommendations sup-
port the intent of Congress to keep pace with 
advances in workplace rights and public ac-
cess laws. 
Accompanying this letter is a copy of the 
Board’s Section 102(b) Report for the 117th 
Congress. This report was submitted elec-
tronically to President Pro Tempore Grass-
ley and Speaker Pelosi on December 31, 2020, 
which was the filing date required by stat-
ute. We welcome discussion on these issues 
and urge that Congress act on these impor-
tant recommendations. 
As required by the CAA, we request that 
this publication be printed in the Congres-
sional Record and referred to the commit-
tees of the U.S. Senate with jurisdiction. 
Sincerely, 
SUSAN TSUI GRUNDMANN, 
Executive Director, 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
FOR 
IMPROVE-
MENTS TO THE CONGRESSIONAL AC-
COUNTABILITY ACT 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights— 
Board of Directors’ Biennial Report re-
quired by 102(b) of the Congressional Ac-
countability Act issued at the conclusion of 
the 116th Congress for consideration by the 
117th Congress 
Statement from the Board of Directors 
With its enactment of the Congressional 
Accountability Act (CAA) in 1995, Congress 
first applied to the legislative branch the 
same laws regarding workplace rights and 
the employment relationship as governed the 
executive branch and private sector, includ-
ing those addressing discrimination, work-
place safety and health, wages and hours, ac-
cessibility, and collective bargaining and 
labor-management relations. Passage of the 
CAA in the opening days of the 104th Con-
gress with nearly unanimous approval re-
flected a Congressional promise to the Amer-
ican public that it would hold itself account-
able to the same federal workplace and ac-
cessibility standards as apply to private sec-
tor employers and executive branch agen-
cies. 
This commitment is not meant to be stat-
ic. Rather, the CAA provides for an ongoing, 
vigilant review of federal law to ensure that 
Congress continues to apply to itself—where 
appropriate—the labor, employment, health, 
and safety laws that it enacts. To further 
this goal, section 102(b) of the CAA tasks the 
Board of Directors of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights (OCWR) to review 
federal legislation and regulations to ensure 
that workplace protections in the legislative 
branch are on par with those applicable to 
private sector and executive branch agen-
cies. Accordingly, every Congress, the Board 
reports on: 
whether or to what degree [provisions of 
Federal law (including regulations) relating 
to (A) the terms and conditions of employ-
ment (including hiring, promotion, demo-
tion, termination, salary, wages, overtime 
compensation, benefits, work assignments or 
reassignments, grievance and disciplinary 
procedures, protection from discrimination 
in personnel actions, occupational health 
and safety, and family and medical and other 
leave) of employees; and (B) access to public 
services and accommodations] . . . are appli-
cable or inapplicable to the legislative 
branch, and (2B) with respect to provisions 
inapplicable 
to 
the 
legislative 
branch, 
whether such provisions should be made ap-
plicable to the legislative branch. 
This section of the CAA also requires that 
the presiding officers of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate cause our Re-
port to be printed in the Congressional 
Record and refer the report to Committees of 
the House and Senate with jurisdiction. 
In past Reports, the Board has taken a 
broad 
approach 
in 
presenting 
its 
rec-
ommendations to amend the CAA. In this 
Report, we highlight key recommendations 
that the Board has made in past Section 
102(b) Reports that have not yet been imple-
mented, as well as additional recommenda-
tions to amend the CAA to increase trans-
parency, discourage protracted administra-
tive proceedings at the taxpayers’ expense, 
and enjoin unlawful conduct. 
While recognizing the enormous impor-
tance of many of the other issues faced today 
by the 117th Congress, the Board is hopeful 
that issuance of this Section 102(b) Report 
will result in legislative action necessary to 
implement these recommendations so that 
the CAA remains current with the employ-
ment needs of the legislative branch. With-
out action on the Board’s recommendations, 
the worthy goals of the CAA gradually may 
be eroded.

February 25, 2021 
The Board welcomes an opportunity to fur-
ther discuss these recommendations and 
asks for careful consideration of the requests 
by the 117th Congress.

Recommendations for the 117th Congress 
Amend the CAA to Allow the OCWR Board of 
Directors to Authorize the OCWR General 
Counsel to Seek Appropriate Temporary 
Relief after Filing an Unfair Labor Prac-
tice (ULP) Charge 
Section 220 of the CAA incorporates cer-
tain provisions of the Federal Service Labor- 
Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) 
to the legislative branch. 2 U.S.C. § 1351. In 
general, the OCWR General Counsel exer-
cises the same authority delegated to the 
General Counsel of the Federal Labor Rela-
tions Authority (FLRA) under 5 U.S.C. 
§ § 7104 and 7118 in the executive branch, that 
is, the authority to investigate allegations of 
ULPs and to file and prosecute complaints 
regarding ULPs. 
The CAA, however, does not currently in-
corporate the provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 7123(d), 
pursuant to which parties to ULP pro-
ceedings in the executive branch may re-
quest the FLRA General Counsel to seek ap-
propriate 
temporary 
relief, 
including 
issuance of a temporary restraining order. 
Specifically, section 7123(d) provides: 
The Authority may, upon issuance of a 
complaint as provided in section 7118 of this 
title charging that any person has engaged 
in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, 
petition any United States district court 
within any district in which the unfair labor 
practice in question is alleged to have oc-
curred or in which such person resides or 
transacts business for appropriate temporary 
relief (including a restraining order). Upon 
the filing of the petition, the court shall 
cause notice thereof to be served upon the 
person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction 
to grant any temporary relief (including a 
temporary restraining order) it considers 
just and proper. A court shall not grant any 
temporary relief under this section if it 
would interfere with the ability of the agen-
cy to carry out its essential functions or if 
the Authority fails to establish probable 
cause that an unfair labor practice is being 
committed. 
This important statutory provision in the 
FSLMRS allows the FLRA General Counsel 
to seek, in appropriate cases when a ULP 
Complaint is filed, temporary relief in any 
United States District Court when it would 
be just and proper to do so and the record es-
tablishes probable cause that an ULP is 
being committed. 
Incorporating 
the 
provisions 
5 
U.S.C. 
§ 7123(d) into the CAA would allow the OCWR 
Board to authorize the OCWR General Coun-
sel to seek appropriate temporary relief in 
the same manner and under the same cir-
cumstances. In the Board’s view, the grant of 
authority to the OCWR General Counsel to 
seek appropriate temporary relief under the 
CAA would, as has proven to be in the execu-
tive branch, operate as a strong disincentive 
for parties in the legislative branch to en-
gage 
in 
protracted 
administrative 
pro-
ceedings at the taxpayers’ expense while con-
tinuing to engage in ULPs.1 
Amend the Confidentiality Provisions of the 
CAA to Exclude Proceedings under the 
FSLMRS and the Public Access Provi-
sions of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA) (CAA Sections 210 and 220) 
The general confidentiality provisions of 
the CAA that govern administrative hear-
ings and deliberations are set forth at sec-
tion 416 of the Act. 2 U.S.C. § 1416. They cur-
rently provide in relevant part that ‘‘all pro-
ceedings and deliberations of hearing officers 
and the Board, including any related records, 
shall be confidential. This subsection shall 
not apply to proceedings under section 1341 
of this title [concerning proceedings under 
the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 (OSHAct)], but shall apply to the delib-
erations of hearing officers and the Board 
under that section.’’ Congress excluded pro-
ceedings under the OSHAct from these con-
fidentiality provisions because it determined 
that the public interest in transparency con-
cerning safety and health proceedings on 
Capitol Hill outweighed any value in keeping 
them confidential. 
The Board believes that the public interest 
in transparency outweighs any value in con-
fidentiality for proceedings under the ADA 
public access provisions and the labor-man-
agement provisions of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. 
§§ 1331, 1351. Unlike the individual employ-
ment matters covered by Part A of sub-
chapter II of the CAA where there is un-
doubtedly value in keeping individual per-
sonnel disputes confidential, the matters 
covered by Parts B (ADA public access), C 
(occupational safety and health), and D 
(labor-management relations) primarily in-
volve institutional and public concerns with 
maintaining facilities, policies, and pro-
grams that are safe, healthful, accessible, 
and free from ULPs. The current lack of 
transparency undermines the public’s con-
fidence that those statutory mandates are 
being fully enforced, encourages protracted 
litigation at taxpayer expense, and discour-
ages voluntary compliance. 
Accordingly, the Board recommends that 
section 416 of the CAA be amended to exclude 
from its confidentiality provisions, pro-
ceedings under the FSLMRS and the public 
access provisions of the ADA. This could be 
accomplished by amending the second sen-
tence in CAA section 416(b) as follows: ‘‘This 
subsection shall not apply to proceedings 
under sections 1331, 1341, and 1351 of this 
title, but shall apply to deliberations of 
hearing officers and the Board under these 
sections.’’ 
Amend the Voluntary Mediation Provisions 
of the CAA’s Administrative Dispute Res-
olution (ADR) Procedures to Require Me-
diation upon Request of the Claimant 
Prior to the CAA Reform Act, the CAA’s 
ADR 
procedures 
required, 
among 
other 
things, that an employee file a request for 
mediation with the OCWR as a jurisdictional 
prerequisite to filing a complaint with the 
OCWR or in the U.S. District Court. Further, 
the CAA provided that the mediation period 
‘‘shall be 30 days,’’ which could be extended 
upon the joint request of the parties. 
As a result of the CAA Reform Act amend-
ments, however, mediation is no longer man-
datory—rather, mediation takes place only if 
requested and only if both parties agree. 2 
U.S.C. § 1403. This change from mandatory to 
voluntary mediation was enacted amid con-
cerns that the mandatory mediation process 
could serve to delay the availability of statu-
tory relief for victims of harassment or other 
conduct prohibited by the CAA. Concerns 
were also expressed that employees could 
view the mandatory mediation process as in-
timidating—especially those who are unrep-
resented by counsel in mediation but who 
face an employing office represented by legal 
counsel. The amendment was also enacted 
amid consensus that mediation is most suc-
cessful when claimants feel comfortable and 
adequately supported in the process. 
The Board continues to view mediation as 
a valuable option available to settle disputes 
under the CAA. The OCWR’s experience over 
many years has been that a large percentage 
of controversies have been successfully re-
solved 
without 
formal 
adversarial 
pro-
ceedings, due in large part to its mediation 
processes. Mediation can save the parties 
from burdensome litigation, which can be ex-
pensive, time consuming, and a drain on re-
sources and workplace productivity. Medi-
ation also gives the parties an opportunity 
to explore resolving the dispute themselves 
without having a result imposed upon them. 
Furthermore, OCWR mediators are highly 
skilled professionals who have the sensi-
tivity, expertise, and flexibility to customize 
the mediation process to meet the concerns 
of the parties. In short, the effectiveness of 
mediation as a tool to resolve workplace dis-
putes cannot be understated. 
The Board is concerned, however, that the 
CAA Reform Act amendments requiring the 
consent of both parties to mediation effec-
tively gives the employing offices a veto 
over claimants who wish to attempt to settle 
their claims with the assistance of an OCWR 
mediator. None of the concerns expressed at 
the time the CAA Reform Act was passed 
warrant such a result. Moreover, none of the 
policies underlying mediation are furthered 
when an employee’s request for mediation is 
effectively denied by the employing office. 
Further, there is no indication that an em-
ploying office would be adversely affected if 
it were required to participate in mediation 
when it is requested by the claimant. Requir-
ing mediation upon the request of a claimant 
will maximize the chances of achieving a 
voluntary settlement that best meets the 
needs of all parties to the dispute. 
Accordingly, the Board recommends that 
the CAA be amended to provide that medi-
ation take place if requested by the claim-
ant, or if requested by the employing office 
and agreed to by the claimant. 
Protect Employees Who Serve on Jury Duty 
(28 U.S.C. § 1875) 
Section 1875 of title 28 of the U.S. Code pro-
vides that no employer shall discharge, 
threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce 
any permanent employee by reason of such 
employee’s jury service, or the attendance or 
scheduled attendance in connection with 
such service, in any court of the United 
States. This section currently does not cover 
legislative branch employment. For the rea-
sons set forth in the 1996, 1998, 2000, 2006, and 
2019 Section 102(b) Reports, the Board rec-
ommends that the rights and protections 
against discrimination on this basis should 
be applied to covered employees and employ-
ing offices within the legislative branch. 
Protect Employees and Applicants Who Are 
or Have Been In Bankruptcy (11 U.S.C. 
§ 525) 
Section 525(a) of title 11 of the U.S. Code 
provides that ‘‘a governmental unit’’ may 
not deny employment to, terminate the em-
ployment of, or discriminate with respect to 
employment against, a person because that 
person is or has been a debtor under the 
bankruptcy statutes. This provision cur-
rently does not apply to the legislative 
branch. Reiterating the recommendations 
made in the 1996, 1998, 2000, 2006, and 2019 
Section 102(b) Reports, the Board advises 
that the rights and protections against dis-
crimination on this basis should be applied 
to covered employees and employing offices 
within the legislative branch.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S904 
February 25, 2021 
Prohibit Discharge of Employees Who Are or 
Have Been Subject to Garnishment (15 
U.S.C. § 1674(a)) 
Section 1674(a) of title 15 of the U.S. Code 
prohibits discharge of any employee because 
his or her earnings ‘‘have been subject to 
garnishment for any one indebtedness.’’ This 
section is limited to private employers, so it 
currently has no application to the legisla-
tive branch. For the reasons set forth in the 
1996, 1998, 2000, 2006, and 2019 Section 102(b) 
Reports, the Board recommends that the 
rights and protections against discrimina-
tion on this basis should be applied to cov-
ered employees and employing offices within 
the legislative branch. 
Provide Whistleblower Protections to the 
Legislative Branch 
Civil service law provides broad protection 
to whistleblowers in the executive branch to 
safeguard workers against reprisal for re-
porting violations of laws, rules, or regula-
tions, gross mismanagement, gross waste of 
funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial 
and specific danger to public health or safe-
ty. In the private sector, whistleblowers also 
are often protected by provisions of specific 
federal laws. However, these provisions do 
not apply to the legislative branch. 
The OCWR has received a number of in-
quiries from congressional employees con-
cerned about their lack of whistleblower pro-
tections. The absence of specific statutory 
protection against reprisal such as that pro-
vided under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8) chills the dis-
closure of vital information in the public in-
terest to guard against legislative branch 
mismanagement and abuse. Granting whis-
tleblower protection could significantly im-
prove the rights and protections afforded to 
legislative branch employees in an area fun-
damental to the institutional integrity of 
the legislative branch by uncovering waste 
and fraud and safeguarding the budget. 
The Board has recommended in its pre-
vious Section 102(b) Reports and continues to 
recommend that Congress provide whistle-
blower reprisal protections to legislative 
branch employees comparable to that pro-
vided to executive branch employees under 5 
U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8) and 5 U.S.C. § 1221. Addi-
tionally, the Board recommends that the Of-
fice be granted investigatory and prosecu-
torial authorities over whistleblower reprisal 
complaints, by incorporating into the CAA 
the authority granted to the Office of Spe-
cial Counsel, which investigates and pros-
ecutes claims of whistleblower reprisals in 
the executive branch. 
Provide Subpoena Authority to Obtain Infor-
mation Needed for Safety and Health In-
vestigations and Require Records to Be 
Kept of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses 
The CAA applies the broad protections of 
section 5 of the OSHAct to the congressional 
workplace. The OCWR enforces the OSHAct 
in the legislative branch much in the same 
way the Secretary of Labor enforces the 
OSHAct in the private sector. Under the 
CAA, the OCWR is required to conduct safety 
and health inspections of covered employing 
offices at least once each Congress and in re-
sponse to any request, and to provide em-
ploying offices with technical assistance to 
comply with the OSHAct’s requirements. 
But Congress and its agencies are still ex-
empt from critical OSHAct requirements im-
posed upon American businesses. Under the 
CAA, employing offices in the legislative 
branch are not subject to investigative sub-
poenas to aid in inspections as are private 
sector employers under the OSHAct. Simi-
larly, Congress exempted itself from the 
OSHAct’s recordkeeping requirements per-
taining to workplace injuries and illnesses 
that apply to the private sector. 
The Board continues to recommend that 
legislative branch employing offices be sub-
ject to the investigatory subpoena provisions 
contained in OSHAct section 8(b) and that 
legislative branch employing offices be re-
quired to maintain records of workplace in-
juries and illnesses under OSHAct section 
8(c), 29 U.S.C. § 657(c), in the interests of the 
safety and health of legislative branch em-
ployees. 
Adopt Recordkeeping Requirements under 
Federal Workplace Rights Laws 
The Board has recommended in several 
Section 102(b) Reports, and continues to rec-
ommend that Congress adopt all record-
keeping requirements under federal work-
place rights laws, including title VII. Al-
though some employing offices in the legis-
lative branch keep personnel records, there 
are no legal requirements under the CAA to 
do so. 
Approve the Board’s Pending ADA Public Ac-
cess Regulations 
The CAA directs the OCWR Board to pro-
mulgate regulations implementing the CAA 
to keep Congress current and accountable to 
the workplace laws that apply to private and 
public employers. The Board is required to 
issue substantive regulations to achieve par-
ity, unless there is good cause shown to devi-
ate from the private sector or executive 
branch regulations. Pursuant to section 304 
of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384, the procedure for 
proposing and approving substantive regula-
tions provides that: (1) the Board of Direc-
tors proposes substantive regulations and 
publishes a general notice of proposed rule-
making in the Congressional Record; (2) 
there be a comment period of at least 30 days 
after the date of publication of the general 
notice of proposed rulemaking; (3) after con-
sideration of comments by the Board of Di-
rectors, the Board adopts regulations and 
transmits notice of such action (together 
with the regulations and a recommendation 
regarding the method for congressional ap-
proval of the regulations) to the Speaker of 
the House and President Pro Tempore of the 
Senate for publication in the Congressional 
Record; (4) there be committee referral and 
action on the proposed regulations by resolu-
tion in each House, concurrent resolution, or 
by joint resolution; and (5) there be final 
publication of the approved regulations in 
the Congressional Record, with an effective 
date prescribed in the final publication. 
The Board recommended in its 2019 Section 
102(b) Report to the 116th Congress that Con-
gress approve the Board’s pending regula-
tions that would implement titles II and III 
of the ADA in the legislative branch. The 
Board again recommends in this Report that 
Congress approve its adopted regulations. 
Public access to Capitol Hill and con-
stituent access to district and state offices 
have long been congressional hallmarks of 
our democracy. The Board’s ADA regula-
tions, which await Congressional approval, 
further ensure that continued access. First, 
the Board’s ADA regulations clarify which 
title II and title III regulations apply to the 
legislative branch. This knowledge will un-
doubtedly save taxpayers money by ensuring 
pre-construction 
review 
of 
construction 
projects for ADA compliance—rather than 
providing for only post-construction inspec-
tions and costly redos when the access is not 
adequate. Second, under the regulations 
adopted by the Board, all leased spaces must 
meet some basic accessibility requirements 
that apply to all federal facilities that are 
leased or constructed. In this way, Congress 
will remain a model for ADA compliance and 
public access. Under the authority of the 
landmark CAA, the OCWR has made signifi-
cant progress toward making Capitol Hill 
more accessible for persons with disabilities. 
Our efforts to improve access to the build-
ings and facilities on the campus are con-
sistent with the priority guidance in the 
Board’s ADA regulations, which it adopted 
in February 2016. Congressional approval of 
those regulations would reaffirm its commit-
ment to provide barrier-free access to the 
Capitol Hill complex for the visiting public. 
Approve the Board’s Pending FMLA and 
USERRA Regulations When They Are Re-
submitted to Congress 
The Board also recommended in its Sec-
tion 102(b) Report to the 116th Congress that 
Congress approve its pending regulations to 
implement the Family and Medical Leave 
Act (FMLA) and the Uniformed Services Em-
ployment and Reemployment Rights Act 
(USERRA). As discussed below, however, fur-
ther legislative developments, including the 
enactment of the CAA of 1995 Reform Act of 
2018, Pub. L. No. 115–397, and Federal Em-
ployee Paid Leave Act (FEPLA) (subtitle A 
of title LXXVI of division F of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2020, Public Law 116–92, December 20, 2019), 
have and will necessitate further amend-
ments of these regulations, which the Board 
will resubmit to Congress for approval. 
THE BOARD’s FMLA REGULATIONS 
On June 22, 2016, the Board adopted and 
submitted for publication in the Congres-
sional Record additional amendments to its 
substantive 
regulations 
regarding 
the 
FMLA. 162 Cong. Rec. H4128–H4168, S4475– 
S4516 (daily ed. June 22, 2016). The 2016 
amendments provided needed clarity on cer-
tain aspects of the FMLA. First, they added 
the military leave provisions of the FMLA, 
enacted under the National Defense Author-
ization Acts for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2010, 
Pub. L. 110–181, Div. A, Title V 585(a)(2), 
(3)(A)-(D) and Pub. L. 111–84, Div. A, Title V 
565(a)(1)(B) and (4), which extended the avail-
ability of FMLA leave to family members of 
the regular armed forces for qualifying ex-
igencies arising out of a servicemember’s de-
ployment. They also defined those deploy-
ments covered under these provisions, ex-
tended FMLA military caregiver leave for 
family members of current servicemembers 
to include an injury or illness that existed 
prior to service and was aggravated in the 
line of duty while on active duty, and ex-
tended FMLA military caregiver leave to 
family members of certain veterans with se-
rious injuries or illnesses. Second, the 
amendments set forth the revised definition 
of ‘‘spouse’’ under the FMLA in light of the 
Department of Labor’s February 25, 2015 
Final Rule on the definition of spouse, and 
the United States Supreme Court’s decision 
in Obergefell, et al., v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 
(2015), which requires a state to license a 
marriage between two people of the same sex 
and to recognize a marriage between two 
people of the same sex when their marriage 
was lawfully licensed and performed out-of- 
state. 
Congress has not yet acted on the Board’s 
request for approval of these 2016 amend-
ments. However, on December 20, 2019, it en-
acted the FEPLA, which further amended 
the FMLA to allow most civilian federal em-
ployees, including eligible employees in the 
legislative branch, to substitute up to 12 
weeks of paid parental leave for unpaid 
FMLA leave granted in connection with the 
birth of an employee’s son or daughter or for 
the placement of a son or daughter with an 
employee for adoption or foster care. Fur-
ther modifications of the Board’s substantive 
regulations are therefore necessary in order 
to bring existing legislative branch FMLA 
regulations (issued April 19, 1996) in line with 
these recent statutory changes. 
Accordingly, on November 16, 2020, the 
OCWR Board issued a Notice of Proposed

February 25, 2021 
Rulemaking and request for comments from 
interested parties, which concerns additional 
proposed amendments to the Board’s sub-
stantive FMLA regulations to implement 
FEPLA. The Board also proposed to amend 
these regulations to update references to the 
OCWR’s current administrative dispute reso-
lution procedures, which were significantly 
amended by the CAA of 1995 Reform Act of 
2018. The comment period ended 30 days from 
the date of publication of the Board’s notice 
in the Congressional Record, i.e., on Decem-
ber 17, 2020. The Board is currently reviewing 
the comments it received and is preparing its 
Notice of Adopted Rulemaking for publica-
tion in the Congressional Record. The 
Board’s Notice of Adopted Rulemaking will 
also constitute the resubmission for congres-
sional approval of its 2016 amendments to its 
substantive 
FMLA 
regulations 
discussed 
above. Congressional approval of the Board’s 
adopted FMLA regulations when they are re-
submitted will be critical to implementing 
these expanded family and medical leave 
protections in the legislative branch. 
THE BOARD’s USERRA REGULATIONS 
On December 3, 2008, the OCWR Board of 
Directors adopted USERRA regulations to 
apply to the legislative branch. These regu-
lations support our nation’s veterans by re-
quiring continuous health care insurance 
and job protections for the men and women 
of the armed services who have supported 
our country’s freedoms. They signal a com-
mitment to anti-discrimination, anti-retal-
iation, and job protections under USERRA. 
Those regulations, transmitted to Congress 
over 10 years ago, have not yet been ap-
proved. As with the Board’s FMLA regula-
tions, however, it has become necessary to 
make additional amendments to these regu-
lations to update references to the OCWR’s 
current administrative dispute resolution 
procedures that were significantly amended 
by the CAA of 1995 Reform Act of 2018. 
Approving the USERRA regulations when 
they are resubmitted for approval will assist 
servicemembers in attaining and retaining a 
job despite the call to duty. Approving 
USERRA regulations would signal congres-
sional encouragement to veterans to seek 
work in the legislative branch where veteran 
employment levels have historically been 
well below the percentage in the executive 
branch, or even in the private sector, which 
is not under a mandate to provide a pref-
erence in hiring to veterans. Indeed, many 
reports have put the level of veteran employ-
ees on congressional staffs at 2–3 percent or 
less. 
Congress has long focused on issues con-
cerning the health, welfare, accessibility, 
and employment status of veterans on Cap-
itol Hill. For example, the Veterans Congres-
sional Fellowship Caucus, started in 2014, has 
supported efforts to bridge the gap between 
military service and legislative work. In ad-
dition, the Wounded Warrior Fellowship Pro-
gram exists in the office of the Chief Admin-
istrative Officer of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives where Members can hire veteran 
Fellows for 2-year terms. In the Senate, the 
Armed Forces Internship Program exists to 
provide on-the-job training for returning vet-
erans with disabilities. Further, Public Law 
No. 115–364, signed into law in 2018, makes 
clear that disabled veterans in the legisla-
tive branch are covered under the provisions 
of the Wounded Warrior Act. As such, they 
may receive wounded warrior leave during 
their first year in the workforce for treat-
ment for their service-connected disabilities. 
An extension of these laudable efforts in 
support of our veterans should include the 
long-delayed passage of the Board’s adopted 
USERRA regulations, which implement pro-
tections 
for 
initial 
hiring 
and 
protect 
against discrimination based on military 
service. Congress can lead by example by ap-
plying the USERRA law encompassed in the 
CAA. 
Approving the three sets of Board-adopted 
regulations outlined above would not only 
signify a continued congressional commit-
ment to the laws of the CAA—which passed 
in 1995 with nearly unanimous bicameral and 
bipartisan support—but would ensure the ef-
fective implementation of the laws’ work-
place protections and benefits on behalf of 
the legislative branch workforce. 
ENDNOTES 
1. The Board has long advocated for legislation 
granting the OCWR General Counsel the authority 
to investigate and prosecute complaints of discrimi-
nation, harassment, and reprisal in order to assist 
victims and to improve the adjudicatory process 
under the CAA. On December 21, 2018, as we were in 
the process of finalizing the Section 102(b) Report 
for the 116th Congress, the CAA of 1995 Reform Act, 
S. 3749, was signed into law. As discussed in that Re-
port, the Reform Act establishes new procedures 
that are also clearly intended to further these policy 
goals. Under these circumstances, the Board be-
lieves that the best course of action is to continue 
to evaluate the efficacy of the new Reform Act pro-
cedures before revisiting the issue of whether the 
OCWR General Counsel should be granted such in-
vestigatory and prosecutorial authority. Accord-
ingly, this recommendation is not discussed further 
in this Report.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
THE 
SANTA 
CRUZ 
COUNTY 
MEDICAL 
RESERVE 
CORPS 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the Santa Cruz County Med-
ical Reserve Corps (MRC) which recently 
celebrated sixteen years of service to our 
community since its founding in 2005. 
After the terrible events of 9/11 and the an-
thrax attacks that followed soon after, MRC 
units were formed to organize, train, and equip 
local volunteers to assist public health agen-
cies and the medical community in emergency 
preparedness and response to all-hazards in-
cidents. 
Santa Cruz County MRC volunteers have 
responded with vigor and effectiveness to nu-
merous incidents, including disease outbreaks, 
catastrophic wildfires, floods, power outages, 
and today’s COVID–19 pandemic. MRC volun-
teers have assisted with case investigations, 
contact tracing, infection prevention, sheltering 
of the homeless, the CZU fire evacuation and 
sheltering of those needing a place to live. As 
vaccine has become available, MRC volun-
teers have been on the frontlines of vacci-
nating disabled homebound elders and sup-
porting mass vaccination clinics. The contribu-
tions of medical volunteers have helped public 
health build the community’s resilience and its 
ability to respond to future disasters. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the 
Santa Cruz County Medical Reserve Corps. 
They have strengthened our community and 
set an example for other volunteer organiza-
tions to emulate. I thank them and I ask my 
colleagues to do so also. Their work is exem-
plary and they are bright stars in the fir-
mament of the 18th Congressional District.

HONORING 
FENTRICE DRISKELL 
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Black 
History Month, I am paying tribute to African- 
American leaders from Florida who have 
made outstanding contributions to our commu-
nity and our country. These accomplished 
men and women have not always received the 
recognition they have earned. 
Today I rise to honor Fentrice Driskell. Origi-
nally from Lakeland, Fentrice graduated as 
valedictorian of Lake Gibson High School and 
was the governor of Florida’s 50th session of 
Girls State. Fentrice earned her bachelor’s de-
gree from Harvard University and her law de-
gree from Georgetown University. As an un-
dergraduate, she was the first Black woman 
ever elected as Harvard’s student government 
president. 
After returning to Florida, Fentrice clerked 
for the Honorable Anne C. Conway of the U.S. 
District Court of the Middle District of Florida. 
She served as a leader in The Florida Bar, 
and is currently of counsel at the Tampa- 
based law firm, Carlton Fields. Fentrice is a 
past president of the George Edgecomb Bar 
Association, Tampa Bay’s largest predomi-
nately African-American voluntary bar associa-
tion. 
In 2018, Fentrice was elected to the Florida 
House of Representatives, where she serves 
as policy chair for the Democratic Caucus. 
Representative Driskell is a trailblazer, a 
fierce and effective advocate for her Tampa 
constituents, and a source of tremendous 
pride for her fellow Floridians. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and celebrating Fentrice Driskell.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Andrew Jackson Statue 
Removal Act, which would remove the Andrew 
Jackson statue from Lafayette Park, a federal 
park in the District of Columbia, and require 
the Secretary of the Interior to donate the stat-
ue to a museum or a similar entity. This bill is 
part of a series of statue and memorial re-
moval bills I am introducing during Black His-
tory Month. 
The land that comprises Lafayette Park has 
been used as a racetrack, a showplace for 
caged animals, a graveyard, a slave market, 
an encampment for soldiers and for political 
protests and celebrations. Jackson was a Ten-
nessee slaveholder and signed a law that 
forced Native Americans to move west of the 
Mississippi River. During this forced expulsion 
by the federal government, roughly 4,000 
Cherokee died in what is now known as the 
Trail of Tears. 
The statue, the first in Lafayette Park, was 
dedicated on January 8, 1853, on the 38th an-
niversary of the Battle of New Orleans, which 
the statue depicts. This prominent location in 
the nation’s capital, right outside of the White 
House, should never have honored a man 
who was an unabashed racist, owned slaves 
and authorized the genocide of Native Ameri-
cans. Jackson’s entire tenure is a shameful 
part of our history and should not be honored 
with a statue in Lafayette Park. 
This bill would direct the Secretary of the In-
terior to ensure the removal of the statue from 
Lafayette Park and to donate the statue and 
marble base to a museum or similar entity so 
that it can be accompanied by the appropriate 
historical context, not be prominently displayed 
in the nation’s capital. The next generation 
can learn from this painful chapter in our his-
tory without celebrating it. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

HONORING THE SACRIFICE OF THE 
14TH QUARTERMASTER DETACH-
MENT 
DURING 
OPERATION 
DESERT STORM 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the extraordinary service and 
sacrifice of the 14th Quartermaster Detach-
ment of the United Slates Army Reserve dur-
ing Operation Desert Storm. Thirty years ago, 
on February 25, 1991, an Iraqi-launched 
SCUD missile killed 28 soldiers and wounded 
99 others. The 14th Quartermaster Detach-
ment, based in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, lost 
13 soldiers and 43 others were wounded, the 
greatest number of casualties of any allied unit 
during the conflict. 
In January of 1991, these citizen soldiers 
from southwestern Pennsylvania deployed 
overseas and put their civilian lives on hold to 
defend Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Ara-
bia from Saddam Hussein’s aggression. Fol-
lowing intense training, the 14th Quarter-
master was selected for the critical task of 
supplying clean water for coalition forces in 
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. On February 19, 
1991, the detachment arrived in Dhahran, and 
six days later, 28 of these brave Americans 
lost their lives, and many others suffered inju-
ries that changed their lives forever. This at-
tack was the deadliest assault on American 
servicemembers 
during 
Operation 
Desert 
Storm. Just one in four members of the 14th 
Quartermaster emerged without mortal or 
physical wounds from the attack. 
Madam Speaker, the brave men and 
women of the 14th Quartermaster Detachment 
of the United States Army Reserve are truly 
exemplary Americans. Thirty years later, the 
legacy of their extraordinary service lives on in 
Pennsylvania and across our nation. We can 
never 
repay 
the 
debt 
we 
owe 
these 
servicemembers and their families, but we 
must ensure their sacrifice is never forgotten.

February 25, 2021 
honor the life and legacy of a formidable force 
from the place I call home. On Sunday, Feb-
ruary 14, 2021, Kansas City lost one of its 
fiercest warriors. A trailblazer, a local civil 
rights icon, and a leader of the highest caliber, 
Carol Coe dedicated her every breath to 
speaking the truth and serving her community. 
Born in Houston, Texas in 1947, the same 
year Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier 
in Major League Baseball, Carol would spend 
her entire life shattering barriers of her own 
and inspiring generations of local Black lead-
ership. After moving to Kansas City in the mid- 
1960s and gaining a juris doctorate from the 
University of Missouri—Kansas City School of 
Law, she served as the City’s first Black as-
sistant city attorney. Carol brought an indis-
putable talent and unmistakable tenacity to the 
role, and her community noticed. She went on 
to serve in the Jackson County Legislature 
and eventually ran for, and won, a position on 
City Council in 1991. 
While serving as Councilwoman for the 3rd 
District of Kansas City, Carol was appointed to 
the Finance Committee and the Convention 
and Visitors Bureau Board of Directors. During 
her time on the Board, Coe was dedicated to 
the revitalization of Kansas City’s historic 18th 
& Vine district, pushing funding initiatives and 
supporting the use of Black contractors for 
various projects in the area. However, Carol’s 
dedication to 18th & Vine was more than an 
administrative project; it was a lifelong labor of 
love. One never had to walk far to feel her 
presence in that historic place, but in October 
of last year, Kansas City’s City Council for-
mally recognized her immense impact on the 
historic district, naming a bridge at East 19th 
and Vine the ‘‘Carol Coe Bridge of Oppor-
tunity.’’ 
Besides our shared devotion to 18th & Vine, 
Carol and I also had in common a passion for 
improving public housing. I vividly remember 
the time she invited her City Council col-
leagues to spend the night with her in an 
apartment in the T.B. Watkins public housing 
project. The move sought to showcase what 
were, at the time, dangerous and unsafe living 
conditions endured by Kansas City residents. 
While there is still much work to be done, 
Kansas City has made great strides in public 
housing since that time, in large part because 
of Carol’s advocacy. And while her work—the 
work of justice—was constant and unremitting, 
Carol accomplished these feats while bal-
ancing her responsibility of being a loving and 
devoted mother to her two children. 
Carol’s career is a story not of chapters but 
of volumes. She was involved with Freedom, 
Inc., a political club in Kansas City that has 
spent decades ensuring that the voices of 
Kansas City’s Black community are heard in 
the halls of government. She helped establish 
Kansas City Friends of Alvin Ailey, a re-
nowned local dance program. And then, of 
course, there is the Green Acres Urban Farm 
and Research Bio-Park, which she founded in 
2010. 
Green 
Acres 
is 
an 
innovative 
aquaponics system, designed with a sustain-
able structure to address the impacts of cli-
mate change and local food insecurity. While 
urban farming may have seemed like an un-
likely endeavor for Carol, the ambitious project 
was truly a perfect representation of who she 
had always been. Whether she was debating 
in the Jackson County Legislature, advocating 
for those she represented on the City Council, 
or building and operating an urban farm, Carol 
was committed to community-first, community- 
focused change. Embodying the spirit of serv-
ant leadership in all that she did, Carol Coe 
provided 
resources 
and 
opportunities 
to 
marginalized people to help improve their 
lives. With every vote she cast, Carol stood 
out as a servant of the people. 
‘‘The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom, 
/ and their tongues speak what is just. The law 
of their God is in their heart, / their feet do not 
slip,’’ says the holy scripture in Psalm 37:30– 
31. Carol Coe was a fighter. She fought not 
for herself, not for power or influence, but for 
her community. In her seventy-four years, I 
would venture to guess that Carol never once 
said anything but what she meant and be-
lieved to be true. She pushed and challenged 
me when I was Mayor of Kansas City, and I 
am a better public servant because of it. Her 
candor laid bricks; her tenacity moved legisla-
tion; and her tireless work in Kansas City has 
left an indelible footprint that will outlast us all. 
My thoughts and prayers are with Carol’s 
family, 
friends, 
and 
community. 
Madam 
Speaker, please join me and Missouri’s Fifth 
Congressional District in recognizing and hon-
oring Carol Coe’s incredible life and the legacy 
that she leaves behind. The Kansas City com-
munity will forever remember Carol Coe as a 
vigorous and determined champion for those 
in need. Her righteous spirit brought wisdom 
to those who needed it, even when they did 
not want it. Her tongue lifted justice into being, 
even when the strongest of arms could not 
raise it. And never, not once, did her feet slip. 
Carol was Kansas City’s anchor to the truth, 
and she held us in place for many, many 
years. I am heartened to know that she has 
now, at long last, found eternal rest. I hope 
she found peace in knowing that her fight for 
a more just community will continue through of 
the legions of righteous warriors she inspired. 
Madam Speaker, in our ongoing struggle for a 
better country and a better world, let us seek 
to emulate the example of Carol Coe. Let our 
feet not slip. Not for one second.

CELEBRATING 
BLACK 
HISTORY 
MONTH AND HONORING JOSHUA 
SIMMONS 
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Black 
History Month, I am paying tribute to African- 
American leaders from Florida who have 
made outstanding contributions to our commu-
nity and our country. These accomplished 
men and women have not always received the 
recognition they have earned. 
Today I rise to honor Joshua Simmons. 
Joshua was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and 
attended high school in Virginia. He moved to 
Coral Springs in 2011 to raise his younger sis-
ter while their mother was deployed overseas 
with the U.S. Navy. Joshua was an active 
member of the city’s Martin Luther King Jr. 
Multi-Cultural Advisory and Customer Involved 
Government committees. 
Joshua earned his bachelor’s degree in po-
litical science from Florida Atlantic University 
and his master’s degree in psychology from 
Kaplan University, after which he worked in 
the mental health and subsequently as a 
teacher in the Broward County Public School 
system. Currently, he works in the private sec-
tor as an Account Manager at Hotwire Com-
munications, an internet and cable service 
provider. 
In 2018, Joshua was elected to Coral 
Springs’ City Commission, becoming the first 
Black elected official in the city’s history. In 
2020, Joshua became the first African-Amer-
ican man to serve as the city’s Vice Mayor. 
As both an educator and a public servant, 
Vice Mayor Simmons has brought new per-
spectives to the City of Coral Springs. He is a 
strong advocate for his community, working 
tirelessly to improve the lives of his constitu-
ents. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and celebrating Joshua Simmons.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COVID–19 
HOSPITAL 
AND 
HEALTH 
PRO-
VIDER LOAN CONVERSION ACT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to re-introduce the COVID–19 Hospital Loan 
Conversion Act to provide additional, vitally 
needed relief to hospitals and health care pro-
viders who are under water as a result of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Our nation’s hospitals have invested heavily 
to prepare for and care for us during the 
coronavirus pandemic. They canceled tens-of- 
thousands of elective surgeries and non-emer-
gent patient tests at the government’s request 
to help ensure adequate hospital capacity, 
preserve gear and equipment, and reduce the 
risk of unnecessary patient spread. This major 
shift has put some of America’s hospitals on 
the brink of financial disaster. 
While the $175 billion provider grant pro-
gram, designed to provide support to all pro-
viders, is helpful, more support is needed. 
This legislation will convert Medicare Accel-
erated and Advance Payments loans to grants 
to ensure the additional financial support hos-
pitals and other providers direly need. 
Loan conversion would be for health care 
related expenses or lost revenues that are di-
rectly attributable to coronavirus. And, just like 
the requirement in the provider grant program, 
providers electing to have their advance pay-
ment loans converted would be obligated to 
abstain from balance or surprise billing any 
patient for COVID-related treatment. 
The bill also outlines criteria for trans-
parency and accountability of the loan conver-
sion, including no executive compensation. 
Hospitals across my district have shared 
that in the absence of more financial support, 
including this assistance, it is possible some 
hospitals will be forced to close or significantly 
scale back operations. 
This would be a tragic consequence, espe-
cially if the country is hit with another round of 
the viral epidemic in the near future. I thank 
my colleague, Representative BOB GIBBS, for 
his bipartisan work on this. We look to leader-
ship and the Senate for further action on hos-
pital loan conversion.

HONORING JAMES ‘‘JIMMY’’ MOLL 
FOR A LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO 
OUR COUNTRY AND COMMUNITY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, James Moll lived as the Preamble to the 
American Legion Constitution begins, ‘‘for God 
and country.’’ Mr. Moll embodied each of the 
Legion’s value principles. A Veteran is a Vet-
eran that obliges the Legion to help current 
and former members of the military transition 
into their community. How better to do this 
than by becoming Niagara County and Legion 
Post 264 Commander? 
Jim offered his selfless service to the world 
and his country in the Army, and his American 
values and patriotism were always on display 
in his enlistment in the Army and subsequent 
membership in Chapter 77 of the Vietnam Vet-
erans of America. 
‘‘Jimmy’s’’ engagement with family and com-
munity shined in his devotion to his late wife 
and in his co-founding and board membership 
of the North Tonawanda Botanical Gardens. 
His three-decades-long career with the North 
Tonawanda Board of Education demonstrated 
his commitment to advancing the vision for 
new generations of Americans. Mr. Moll hon-
ored those who came before with his 45-year 
commitment to the Legion and lifelong devo-
tion to God. 
His service protected citizens, his leadership 
helped veterans, his work served students, 
and his appreciation for natural beauty pre-
served it for others. Truly, James Moll was a 
Veteran who strengthened America.

CONGRATULATING DIANA 
BRAMBLE 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Diana Bramble on her selec-
tion as the new superintendent of South Caro-
lina’s Cowpens National Battlefield, located in 
Gaffney, South Carolina, and Kings Mountain 
National Military Park, located in Blacksburg, 
South Carolina. In her new role, Diana will 
also oversee the management of Overmoun-
tain Victory National historic Trail and Ninety 
Six National Historic Trail which she has man-
aged on a temporary basis since September. 
Diana has a tremendous reverence for the 
history of these sites and their place in the 
history of our Nation’s founding. They form the 
National Park Service’s Southern Campaign of 
the American Revolution Parks Group and are 
also part of the Liberty Trail, a path of preser-
vation and interpretation across South Caro-
lina telling the remarkable story of American 
victory in the Revolutionary War. 
Many historians believe the Revolutionary 
War to have been decided in the swamps, 
fields, woods, and mountains of the South, 
won by the grit of Continental soldiers and Pa-
triot militia. It is because of the important work 
of men and women like Diana that the history 
tied to this land will not only be preserved, but 
also interpreted and brought to life for the pub-
lic. 
Diana has served the National Park Service 
for the last decade. She began her career with 
the National Park Service in 2011 as the su-
pervisory horticulturist for Rock Creek Park in 
Washington, D.C. Four years later, she be-
came the chief of maintenance at the National 
Capital Parks-East. In 2019, Diana was 
awarded the honor of being the National Park 
Service National Capital Area Manager of the 
Year. Diana is also a graduate of the National 
Park Service Facility Manager Leaders Pro-
gram and now serves as a program mentor to 
others. 
Diana is both a team player and a tremen-
dous leader. She is passionate about leader-
ship and strives to mentor others to bring out 
their best attributes and support their aspira-
tions. Throughout her tenure with the National 
Park Service, Diana has been able to combine 
her educational background in natural re-
sources with her appreciation for storytelling 
into a successful career in public service. 
I am grateful for the work of Diana and the 
National Park Service and all they do to care 
for our national parks and preserve our leg-
acy. I am excited to welcome Diana to South 
Carolina’s 5th District, and I wish her luck in 
her new role.

BLACK

HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA

Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Black 
History Month, I am paying tribute to African- 
American leaders from Florida who have 
made outstanding contributions to our commu-
nity and our country. These accomplished 
men and women have not always received the 
recognition they have earned. 
Today I rise to honor Linda Hill Anderson. 
Linda is a fourth-generation Hollywood, Florida 
native. She graduated from Hollywood Hills 
High School and Sheridan Vocational School 
and served in the Broward County Public 
School system for over 40 years. 
Linda has been an active member of her 
community, serving as president of the Liberia 
Civic Association and on the African-American 
Advisory Council. 
Linda was elected to Hollywood’s city com-
mission in 2020. She is the first Black woman 
ever to serve on the commission in Holly-
wood’s 95-year history. 
Commissioner Anderson is a trailblazer and 
an extraordinary public servant. She has dedi-
cated her life to making her Hollywood com-
munity stronger and fairer. Every day, she 
works tirelessly to improve the lives of her fel-
low Floridians. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and celebrating Linda Hill Anderson. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE PARK AVE-
NUE 
MISSIONARY 
BAPTIST 
CHURCH 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 100th anniversary of 
the Park Avenue Missionary Baptist Church. 
Since 1921, this church has served as a cor-
nerstone of Kansas City’s African American 
religious community. Under the dedicated and 
passionate leadership of its numerous pastors, 
the Park Avenue Missionary Baptist Church 
has stood strong and prospered. This church 
has served as a center of support during Kan-
sas City’s most trying times and as a center 
of celebration during its best times. No matter 
the challenges Kansas City faced, the Park 
Avenue Missionary Baptist Church has re-
mained steadfast for all the faithful who made 
the church their spiritual home. 
Park Avenue Missionary Baptist Church was 
first established in February of 1921 by the 
late Rev. Thomas H. Ewing. Until the con-
struction of the first house of worship, services 
were held in the homes of congregation mem-
bers. Built at 19th Street & Highland Avenue, 
the original location helped spread the ‘‘good 
news’’ to Kansas City’s Black population for 
thirty-four years. During this time, the church 
led parishioners through some of our nation’s 
darkest periods. Through the hunger of the 
Great Depression, the grief of the Second 
World War, and the sorrows of the Korean 
War, the Park Avenue Missionary Baptist 
Church stood strong and guided churchgoers 
through the trials, tribulations, and troubles 
that tested the resolve of our country. 
In 1955, the congregation moved to a sec-
ond location at 19th Street & Park Avenue. 
For the next sixteen years, Park Avenue Mis-
sionary Baptist Church filled the pews and 
saved the souls at 19th & Park. Within this 
new house of God, the church continued deliv-
ering the word of God, just as it had done for 
nearly thirty-five years. As Black Americans 
across the country were being beaten and 
jailed for demanding equal citizenship, this 
church weathered the storm and provided a 
stable place of worship for Kansas City’s Afri-
can American community. In spite of all that 
the community faced, the ministry grew rapidly 
in size, bringing on six new ministers to the 
fellowship while expanding its program offer-
ings. This remarkable growth in the church 
body served as a testament to the spiritual 
gifts of the congregation’s dedicated leaders 
while laying the foundation for the meteoric 
growth that was soon to come. 
Finally, in 1969, it became apparent that the 
congregation needed a new home. Thus, the 
church began construction on its third and 
final location at the intersection of Park and 
Jackson Avenue in the winter of 1970. For 51 
years, Park Avenue Missionary Baptist Church 
has remained in this location, providing weekly 
services and invaluable spiritual guidance to 
the community which it serves. Since the first 
bricks of this final location were laid, the 
church has been led by Rev. Dr. Carl John-
son, Rev. Dr. Ervin, and Rev. Gregory Ste-
vens, respectively. 
Following the burning of the mortgage in 
1972, the Park Avenue Missionary Baptist

Church has seen incredible growth in con-
gregation size, programming, and community 
outreach capacity. With this growth, the 
church has launched more than 25 different 
ministries, improved the church grounds and 
building in countless ways, and paved the 
path for further expansion in the community it 
serves. In Ephesians 4:16, the Apostle Paul 
writes that, ‘‘from whom the whole body, 
joined and held together by every joint with 
which it is equipped, when each part is work-
ing properly, makes the body grow so that it 
builds itself up in love.’’ The Park Avenue Mis-
sionary Baptist Church is a lesson in practice 
of what it means for a church to build itself up 
in love by leaning on its best parts. Through 
all the trials that its community has endured, 
time and again, the church has come out the 
other end stronger, and more unified. 
For an entire century, the Park Avenue Mis-
sionary Baptist Church has been a pillar of de-
votion in the Kansas City community. I am 
certain that this church will continue to lift up 
its community within Missouri’s Fifth Congres-
sional District for decades to come. Madam 
Speaker, please join me in celebrating and 
honoring Reverend Gregory Stevens and the 
congregants of the Park Avenue Missionary 
Baptist Church for reaching this profound and 
momentous point in their history. Please also 
join me in wishing them continued prosperity 
and peace for the next 100 years to come.

BILL DOUGLAS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize William (Bill) Douglas of 
Boulder, Colorado who passed away on Feb-
ruary 4, 2021. 
Bill grew up outside Philadelphia, Pennsyl-
vania, and attended Drexel University before 
joining the U.S. Army as a 1st Lieutenant in 
the Korean War. After the war, he entered 
graduate school at the University of Colorado. 
Upon graduation, he began a multi-faceted life 
and career as an author, historian, tennis 
coach, college administrator, foundation presi-
dent, and business consultant. In 1959, his 
graduate thesis, A History of Dentistry in Colo-
rado 1859–1959, was published as a book 
and widely read by dentists and Colorado his-
torians. 
Bill was known and admired for his passion 
for education and he held several administra-
tive positions at the University of Colorado in-
cluding dean of admissions, financial aid, and 
registrar. In 1972, Bill helped found the Uni-
versity’s Presidents Leadership Class (PLC) to 
help prepare students to become ethical lead-
ers for Colorado’s future. The class became 
one of the first collegiate leadership programs 
in the United States. After leaving the Univer-
sity, Bill became assistant vice president of 
the Boettcher Foundation from 1980 to 1987 
and then President from 1987 to 1996. As 
president, he oversaw numerous grants and 
scholarships that the Foundation awarded to 
individuals and organizations throughout the 
state. 
After retiring from the Foundation, Bill 
served as the Colorado representative for Fi-
duciary Trust International for more than 12 
years before retiring in 2013. In 2005, the Uni-
versity of Colorado and the Boettcher Founda-
tion established the William A. Douglas En-
dowment Fund for the Presidents Leadership 
Class. 
Bill was a devoted husband and a loving fa-
ther and grandfather. Bill is survived by his 
loving wife, Susan, his children, grandchildren, 
and great-grandchildren. I appreciate and 
thank him for his lifetime of service to our 
community.

SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN IS 
CORRECT AGAIN 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, Talia Kaplan of FOXBusiness re-
ported Tuesday that Former Sen. Joe Lieber-
man . . . blasted the reported meetings be-
tween Biden administration officials and Ira-
nian foreign minister Javad Zarif during the 
Trump administration, calling it ‘‘inappro-
priate.’’ 
‘‘A recent report from The Washington 
Times claimed that Biden administration offi-
cials, including John Kerry and Robert Malley, 
had meetings with Zarif during the Trump ad-
ministration that were orchestrated to . . . ‘de-
vise a political strategy to undermine the 
Trump administration.’ 
‘‘ ‘I think this is a perilous time,’ ’’ Lieberman 
said. ‘I think the previous administration car-
ried out exactly the right policy toward Iran.’ ’’ 
‘‘ ‘So I think that sends a bad signal to Iran 
. . . with all the uncertainty and instability in 
the world, the most serious enemy that could

CELEBRATING 
BLACK

MONTH 
AND 
HONORING 
JUDY 
MOUNT 
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Black 
History Month, I am paying tribute to African- 
American leaders from Florida who have 
made outstanding contributions to our commu-
nity and our country. These accomplished 
men and women have not always received the 
recognition they have earned. 
Today I rise to honor Judy Mount. Judy, a 
longtime resident of Jackson County, made 
history in 1995 when she became the first Afri-
can-American woman elected official in the 
county and served as president of the Malone 
City Council. She continues to serve as Chair-
person of the Jackson County Democratic Ex-
ecutive Committee. 
Judy has faithfully and effectively served the 
Democratic Office in the Florida House of 
Representatives for 18 years. She is a mem-
ber of the Democratic National Committee and 
has been a leader within the Florida Demo-
cratic Party in many different capacities. 
In a series of firsts, Judy was the first Afri-
can-American to be elected Vice-Chair of the 
Florida Democratic Party and, in 2017, she 
became the first African-American elected as 
the interim Chair of the Florida Democratic 
Party. 
Throughout her life, Judy has worked tire-
lessly to make Florida—and our country—bet-
ter, stronger, and more just. She is the epit-
ome of civic engagement and public service. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and celebrating Judy Mount.

CHINA AND THE ELECTRIC CAR 
INDUSTRY 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
clude in the RECORD the following article that 
appeared in the New York Times regarding 
China and the electric car industry. 
[From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 2021] 
IN CHINA, AN ELECTRIC CAR MAKER LOSES 
MONEY BUT THINKS BIG 
(By Keith Bradsher) 
NIO CAN TAP AN EXTENSIVE SUPPLY CHAIN THAT 
BEIJING HAS BUILT TO ACHIEVE ITS DREAM OF 
DOMINATING THE MANUFACTURE OF ELECTRIC 
CARS 
Hefei, China—Walk around the sprawling 
auto factory in central China, and the 
wealth pouring into the country’s electric 
car industry quickly becomes clear. 
Rows of bright orange, 15-foot-tall robots— 
307 of them, mainly from Sweden—whir with 
activity. They glue lightweight aluminum 
panels to vehicle frames using aerospace- 
grade adhesives. In an industry in which 
speed can mean cost efficiency, the assembly 
line plods along at half the pace of many 
lines elsewhere. 
Even by the standards of the $1.6 trillion 
global car industry, an operation like this 
doesn’t come cheap. In fact, the Chinese op-
erator of the factory, a company called Nio, 
loses thousands of dollars on every car it 
makes. State-run companies last year mus-
tered a combined $2.7 billion to bail it out. 
But Nio, or Chinese companies like it, 
could be the future of the global car indus-
try. General Motors and other major names 
are increasingly betting that the next gen-
eration of rides will be powered by batteries 
alone, without a drop of gasoline or diesel. If 
so, China has invested so much money in the 
industry that it could hit the accelerator 
with ease. 
An era of high-quality family electric cars 
that cost $25,000 or less is about to dawn, 
said William Li, Nio’s chairman and chief ex-
ecutive, and Chinese automakers can provide 
them. 
‘‘I don’t think it’s difficult,’’ Mr. Li said. 
‘‘It’s not a big deal.’’ 
Investors see promise in Nio, even though 
it has one factory, sold only about 7,200 cars 
last month and has never made a profit. Its 
$82 billion market capitalization exceeds 
G.M.’s and Ford’s. Its New York-traded 
shares have soared as high as nearly 30-fold 
in the last year. 
It is far from becoming China’s top electric 
car maker. In fact, the two best-selling elec-
tric car brands in China have American ties:

Tesla, the maker of rides with price tags 
that can easily spill into six figures, and a 
joint venture among G.M. and two Chinese 
state companies that makes $5,000 microcars. 
But Nio has the advantage of being able to 
tap into China’s vast and well-funded supply 
chain for electric vehicles. As President 
Biden mulls how much the United States 
should invest in electric cars, China already 
has 14 years of sustained government invest-
ment in the sector. China has also used regu-
lations for more than a decade to force mul-
tinational companies to transfer their best 
electric technologies to joint ventures with 
Chinese manufacturers as a condition of 
entry into its vast market. 
China makes 70 to 80 percent of the world’s 
battery chemicals, battery anodes and bat-
tery cells. China similarly controls most of 
the world’s output of high-strength magnets 
for electric motors, as well as the assembly 
of those magnets into motors. 
‘‘China controls the cards in the battery 
supply chain,’’ said Vivas Kumar, a former 
Tesla manager of battery materials. 
Nio manufactures practically nothing for 
its cars by itself. While companies like Tesla 
make their own batteries and other crucial 
systems, Nio is able to order parts inexpen-
sively from China’s diverse array of elec-
tronics manufacturers and auto parts sup-
pliers. 
Nio has just 120 engineers to manage its as-
sembly plant in Hefei, the capital of Anhui 
Province in central China. Nio then pays 
JAC, a state-controlled automaker also 
based in Hefei, to send 2,300 experienced as-
sembly line workers to run the factory. 
The approach has drawbacks. When de-
mand 
surged 
last 
summer 
after 
China 
brought the coronavirus largely under con-
trol, Nio found some suppliers unprepared to 
increase 
output 
quickly. 
Buyers 
faced 
monthslong delays in getting cars delivered. 
‘‘We have very small, close to zero, inven-
tory,’’ said Victor Gu, general manager of 
the Nio factory. ‘‘It is a big challenge for the 
factory, because you need a quick turn-
around.’’ 
Nio also offers costly customer induce-
ments under its brand, like its Nio Houses. 
Essentially clubhouses for owners of its cars, 
they provide coffee shops, libraries and even 
free day care centers. They take up expen-
sive real estate in 19 Chinese cities, includ-
ing one at the base of East Asia’s tallest 
building, the 128-story Shanghai Tower. 
For a while, Nio also offered an extrava-
gant perk: free recharging of any Nio car 
throughout a customer’s life, as long as the 
customer keeps buying Nio cars and taking 
them to one of the company’s 183 battery- 
swapping stations. While a customer sips a 
coffee, a technician swaps a depleted battery 
for a fully charged one. 
‘‘It only takes about five minutes and 
costs nothing,’’ said Neo Fan, a 38-year-old 
Shanghai 
commercial 
banker 
who 
paid 
$83,000 for his Nio ES8 minivan and is enti-
tled to free recharges for the rest of his life. 
Extravagance and the pandemic slammed 
Nio’s finances. The company lost $11,000 for 
each car sold in the July-through-September 
quarter. 
Government firms stepped up to help. 
State-owned entities in Hefei joined a na-
tional state-owned investment fund last 
spring in paying $1 billion in cash to acquire 
a 24 percent stake in the company. Then, on 
July 10, the state-owned China Construction 
Bank led a consortium of banks in extending 
$1.6 billion in credit to Nio. 
Nio’s chairman, Mr. Li, defended his com-
pany, portraying it as a start-up and noting 
that Tesla required many years before it 
managed last summer to post a fourth con-
secutive quarter of profits. ‘‘We’re very 
happy for Tesla, but this only happened after 
17 years,’’ he said in an interview last au-
tumn. 
While Mr. Li envisions electric cars at 
$25,000 each sometime soon, Nio’s cars are 
now almost as expensive as Tesla’s. Nio’s 
entry-level sedan, the ET7, has a starting 
price of $58,500 with a 70 kilowatt-hour bat-
tery, which can take the car 310 miles. Nio 
plans a new ET7 model late next year with a 
much better battery that will double that 
range. 
The company emphasizes making its cars 
light, for better driving range. Nio estimates 
that replacing steel with costly aluminum 
saves 700 pounds for each car. Nio uses part 
of the weight savings to add other gear, like 
two electric motors in each car instead of 
one. That provides better vehicle handling, 
but it also adds complexity and cost. 
Nio allows buyers to customize their cars, 
including six types of wheels, 11 colors and 
so many other options that the factory can 
go a month without building two identical 
cars. That forces workers to vary their rou-
tines constantly. 
Mr. Gu, the factory’s general manager, 
said his operation was designed to run at 
just 20 cars an hour. Many auto assembly 
lines run twice as fast. 
Nio has had little problem finding money 
lately. It sold more shares in December in 
New York, raising $2.6 billion. That is 
enough money to build a whole row of fac-
tories—and Nio already plans to expand pro-
duction considerably. 
Government support for electric cars re-
mains crucial, and Nio appears to be in good 
official graces. 
One recent indication came in September, 
when a former top Communist Party official, 
Li Yuanchao, paid an unexpected visit to 
Nio’s display at the Beijing auto show. Mr. 
Li was replaced as China’s vice president in 
2018 but remains prominent. 
‘‘It was my first time to talk with him,’’ 
Mr. Li, Nio’s chairman, said afterward. ‘‘He 
actually offered many suggestions about bat-
tery technology, for how to swap batteries.’’

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
SERGEANT TOMMY W. CUDD 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Sergeant Tommy W. 
Cudd, a faithful American hero from Union 
County who passed away on January 28, 
2021. 
Born on March 10, 1960, Tommy was 
raised by two lovely parents, the late H.C. and 
Myrtle Smith Cudd. As a child, he assisted his 
family on their cattle farm where he learned to 
work with animals and bail hay. Tommy’s nat-
ural comfort outdoors gave rise to his love for 
hunting, fishing, camping, and riding tractors. 
He graduated as a charter student from Union 
Academy—the very school in which he built 
alongside his father and lifelong friend, Robert 
Brown. 
Tommy spent 37 honorable years in law en-
forcement. He served as a Reserve Officer, 
Fireman, and Public Safety Officer with the 
City of Union before joining the Union County 
Sheriff’s Office. Despite his lengthy and chal-
lenging battle with leukemia, Tommy per-
severed through all facets of his job and was 
awarded ‘‘Officer of the Year’’ on three sepa-
rate occasions. A true veteran of his field, 
former colleagues assert that his enduring 
work ethic was rare to come by and will cer-
tainly be missed. 
Gary was happily married to Beth Cudd and 
had two sons, Caleb and Tommy. His two 
beautiful granddaughters, Ella and Abby, were 
his utmost pride and joy. He wanted nothing 
more than to make them proud. In the words 
of Sheriff Jeff Bailey, ‘‘Tommy was a person 
who always put everyone first.’’ He was a re-
markable husband, father, and friend who 
chose to dedicate his life to serving a special 
community. There is no doubt in my mind that 
he has left an everlasting mark on Union 
County.

IN MEMORY OF THE PASSING OF 
COLONEL A´ NGEL LUIS FLORES- 
VELLIDO, 
DECORATED 
PUERTO 
RICAN VETERAN 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the memory of one of the 
many brave Puerto Ricans who have served 
our nation in our Armed Forces, the late Colo-
nel A´ ngel Luis Flores-Vellido. 
For over a hundred years, the soldiers from 
Puerto Rico have proved themselves second 
to none in battle, side by side with their com-
rades from across the nation. Colonel Flores- 
Vellido distinguished himself in a long military 
career, among the hundreds of thousands of 
American citizens from Puerto Rico who 
stepped forward and served under the nation’s 
flag, in defense of its security and national in-
terest around the world, in wartime and in 
peacetime. 
A´ ngel Flores-Vellido served the nation start-
ing in the Puerto Rico National Guard in the 
late 1950s and then the Regular Army as an 
Artillery Officer and Foreign Area Officer, com-
pleting higher military studies at the Command 
and General Staff College and the Army War 
College. His service spanned from Vietnam to 
Central and South America, to the Joint Chiefs 
at the Pentagon and the CIA under President 
George H.W. Bush, with achievements that 
earned him numerous high awards, com-
mendations and decorations including the Le-
gion of Merit, Bronze Star, Air Medal, Defense 
Superior Service Medal, Joint Service Com-
mendation and many others, before taking his 
well-earned retirement in 1993. 
Throughout his career and in his retirement, 
he exemplified patriotism and the finest tradi-
tions and values of military service and per-
sonal honor. 
Colonel Flores-Vellido passed away earlier 
this week and will be laid to rest in Dallas, 
Texas. He shall be remembered, with his com-
rades in arms from the past and from the 
present, for adding to the pages of our history 
and proving the worth of the Puerto Rican sol-
dier. 
We share the sorrow of his family and 
friends on his passing, at the same time as we 
celebrate a life of service and commitment. 
Today we honor his memory and his service 
and reaffirm our commitment to do justice for 
our veterans and their families for all they 
have done for us.

Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Black 
History Month, I am paying tribute to African- 
American leaders from Florida who have 
made outstanding contributions to our commu-
nity and our country. These accomplished 
men and women have not always received the

Today I rise to honor Shevrin Jones. 
Shevrin grew up in Carol City. He earned his 
bachelor’s degree in biochemistry and molec-
ular biology from Florida A&M University and 
his master’s degree in educational leadership 
from Florida Atlantic University. Jones went on

profit organization committed to youth leader-
ship development and social entrepreneurship 
training. He is now pursuing his Ph.D. in Edu-
cational Leadership at Florida Atlantic Univer-
sity. 
Shevrin was elected to the Florida House of 
Representatives in 2012, where he served 
honorably for eight years. In 2020, he was 
elected to the Florida Senate, becoming the 
first openly LGBTQ member of any race to 
serve in that chamber. 
Senator Jones is continuing his family’s 
proud legacy of public service. His father, Eric 
Jones, served as Mayor of West Park for over 
15 years. 
Senator Jones has always had a passion for 
education. He taught A.P. Chemistry in the 
Broward County Public School district, serves 
as the Executive Director of Florida Reading 
Corps, and founded South Florida Youth Sum-
mit, the largest gathering of young people in 
South Florida. 
Every day, Senator Jones is making a posi-
tive difference in his community and for our 
country. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and celebrating Shevrin Jones.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Sharon Leatrice (Karr) 
Ritzman of Golden, Colorado who passed 
away on February 8, 2021. 
Sharon’s childhood was spent in Omaha, 
Nebraska. After graduating high school in Ne-

of Pi Beta Phi and graduated with a bachelor’s 
degree in psychology. Shortly thereafter, Shar-
on married Vern Ritzman on August 28, 1965 
in Omaha, NE. Following their wedding, Shar-
on accompanied Vern on his career path of 
family medicine, all the while holding a variety 
of meaningful positions herself. Sharon’s ac-
complishments include chief operator for 
Northwestern Bell Telephone in Sioux City and 
Iowa City, Iowa; client advocate with the Colo-
rado Job Corps; special assistant to the 
United States Air Force Red Horse Officer 
Corps at Osan Air Force Base in Korea (’68– 
’69 Pueblo Incident); healthcare quality assur-
ance consultant for Northrop Corporation (’84 
Saudi Arabia); office manager of Vern’s prac-
tice, president of both the Clear Creek Valley 
and Colorado Medical Society Auxiliaries, and 
an advocate for child health issues through 
the American Medical Association. 
Sharon became active in the community in 
which she and Vern raised their family— 
Wheat Ridge, Colo. She owned a ladies’ bou-
tique, Stepping Out, where her daughter 
helped to manage the store and created 
memories there together until Sharon’s retire-
ment in 2004. During retirement, Sharon and 
Vern traveled the world and enjoyed time with 
their family and friends. 
Sharon was a devoted wife and loving 
mother and grandmother. Sharon is survived 
by her husband of fifty years Dr. Vern 
Ritzman; 
son

HONORING THE LIFE OF CAROL 
ANN MARTINEZ 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA

Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Carol Ann Martinez, wife of 
Marine Corps Veteran SSGT Jose Martinez, 
and an avid volunteer to the American Legion 
Post 132. Carol passed away on January 29, 
2021, during an emergency heart surgery. 
Carol was born on March 6, 1960, and 
raised in Santa Ana, CA. She was a graduate 
of Santa Ana High School and worked for the 
Santa Ana Police Department early on in her 
career. 
Being a proud military wife was a highlight 
for her. She was an Auxiliary member and 
was involved with the American Legion Post 
132 alongside her husband. She assisted with 
the children and youth activities for the post 
and district levels. As well as being a historian 
for the post, she took pictures and docu-
mented activities. Carol also started events 
such as the ‘‘Welcome Home Vietnam Vet-
erans Dinner’’ and the ‘‘Welcome Home Ko-
rean War Veterans Dinner’’. 
She assisted with a multitude of functions 
and fundraisers outside of the Legion as well 
like the Relay for Life. The Relay for Life was 
near and dear to her heart from losing so 
many family members to cancer. 
Carol was incredibly giving, and losing her 
to heart complications affected so many peo-
ple. We will all love her, miss her and remem-
ber her every single day. 
She was laid to rest on February 22, 2021, 
at Riverside National Cemetery. 
She is survived by her husband, her daugh-
ter Jessica and her grandsons Aaron, Evan, 
Jayden and Roman. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
the life of Carol Ann Martinez. May her mem-
ory live on with her loved ones.

Lee Sinclair who passed away on February 
17, 2021. 
Born to the late John Albert Sinclair and 
Gladys Lee Sinclair on September 22, 1947, 
Thomas was raised in Union and graduated 
from Union High School. He pursued a Bach-
elor of Science at Clemson University and re-
ceived both a Master’s in Education and EdS 
degree at Winthrop University. Furthering his 
studies, Thomas attended the United States 
Army War College where he received a Mas-
ter’s in Strategic Studies. Thomas served his 
country as a decorated United States Army 
veteran of 38 years, retiring after earning the 
rank of Brigadier General for the South Caro-
lina Army National Guard. While on active- 
duty, he amassed notable honors including the 
Legion of Merit, the Army Achievement and 
National Defense Service Medals, and the 
South Carolina Palmetto Cross for his dedi-
cated efforts during Operation Hugo. Thomas 
spent half of his military career in command 
roles, leading his surrounding staff through 
significant assignments. 
For 27 years, Thomas found a fulfilling ca-
reer in the Union County School System as a 
high school teacher, junior high school prin-
cipal, and assistant superintendent. He en-
joyed mentoring students and retired as a 
Union County supervisor. A member of Grace 
United Methodist Church, Thomas remained 
faithful and humble through all facets of his 
life. Former Chairman of the Union Community 
Foundation and President of the Union Civitan 
Club, he was determined to leave a lasting 
mark on his hometown. Thomas was happily 
married to Kathryn Bowers Sinclair with three 
adult children, Libby, Kelly, and Tommy, and 
ten beautiful grandchildren. His presence will 
certainly be missed by those who knew him, 
but his legacy will shine on for years to come.

IN CELEBRATION OF WINNETONKA 
HIGH SCHOOL’S 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with abundant joy and everlasting hope 
to 
celebrate 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
Winnetonka High School, a member of the 
North Kansas City School District. For half a 
century, as an institution devoted to instilling 
the fundamental values of tradition, respect, 
unity, 
and 
excellence, 
Winnetonka 
High 
School has consistently proven itself to be far 
more than just a brick-and-mortar school. 
1971 represented the first year that students 
were warmly welcomed to Winnetonka High 
School, a place that future alumni would call 
a ‘‘home away from home.’’ Beginning that 
year, Winnetonka embarked on an endeavor 
to simultaneously provide opportunities to its 
students and service to its community. When 
those first 600 students opened the doors of 
Winnetonka High School for the first time back 
on March 1, 1971, they began a tradition of 
excellence that has been carried on by thou-
sands of students since. In that first year, the 
students and staff collaborated to create an 
environment where they could explore their 
possibilities, prioritize building positive relation-
ships with others, and celebrate the unique 
purpose that inspires each student. 
While many things have changed in our 
country and in the Kansas City community 
over the past fifty years, excellence and inno-
vation have remained constant at Winnetonka. 
Committed to closing the opportunity gap, 
Winnetonka was the first high school in Mis-
souri to be designated as a National Dem-
onstration School for the Advancement Via In-
dividual Determination (AVID) program. This 
designation was earned after years of helping 
students find success in both their school and 
their community through collaboration, inquiry, 
and relationship building. These principles 
have provided the bedrock of the many suc-
cessful student organizations that generations 
of Winnetonka Griffins have helped create. 
Groups like the acclaimed student publication 
Griffin Rites, the Muslim Student Association, 
the Blacks Achieving Greatness organization, 
and the National Honors Society all work to 
create an inclusive, empowering, and exciting 
space where students can realize their full po-
tential. Winnetonka students have relished 
these opportunities, with several becoming 
National Merit Scholarship semi-finalists and 
thousands more finding success in their ca-
reers after graduation. Dr. Eric Johnson, 
Winnetonka’s principal, acknowledged after he 
was named the 2020 Missouri Principal of the 
Year that the accolades of the faculty and staff 
were only made possible by the good fortune 
of having one-of-a-kind students at a one-of-a- 
kind school. It is clear for all to see that Kan-
sas City is a better place to live because of 
the impact that Winnetonka High School grad-
uates have on our community every day. 
In a letter to Booker T. Washington, Mis-
souri-born 
scientist 
George 
Washington 
Carver wrote that ‘‘Education is the key to 
unlock the golden door of freedom.’’ By at-
tending Winnetonka High School, Kansas City 
students not only gain the freedom that comes 
with opportunity, but also the skills and abili-
ties needed to achieve their version of the 
American Dream. As we look to the next fifty 
years, there are certainly a great many unan-
swered questions weighing heavily on our 
minds. However, one thing remains certain: 
Winnetonka High School will continue its ever-
lasting endeavor to provide that most precious 
key to freedom to all students who pass 
through its doors. 
Madam Speaker, colleagues, please join me 
in extending our warm congratulations and 
very best wishes to the administration, faculty, 
staff, parents, and students of Winnetonka 
High School as they commemorate fifty years 
of exceptional service to Kansas City, and fur-
ther extend our best wishes for their continued 
success. Let us also embrace Winnetonka 
High School’s mission in our own lives; let it 
inspire us to educate others responsively, em-
brace our duties fully, and prepare holistically 
the next generation of American leaders, so 
that we can fulfill our unique purposes and 
change our community, our country, and our 
world for the better.

OBSERVING THE 28TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE KHOJALY TRAG-
EDY 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I want to 
call into remembrance of the hundreds of 
Azerbaijanis killed in Khojaly on February 25 
and 26, 1992. Since the beginning of the 
armed conflict between Armenia and Azer-
baijan in the late 1980s, it is reported that the 
Khojaly tragedy was the single worst day in 
this conflict, resulting in hundreds of lives lost, 
families devastated, and the town destroyed. 
A cease-fire was negotiated in 1994, but the 
conflict remains unresolved. In the wake of the 
2020 fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia 
in the Nagorno-Karabakh, it is my hope and 
prayer that the barriers to peace that have 
persisted for the last three decades can be re-
solved. Long-term peace, security, and re-
gional cooperation are in the best interests of 
the entire region of the South Caucasus and 
the world. 
The U.S. and Azerbaijan established diplo-
matic relations in 1992, the same year as the 
Khojaly tragedy. Since then, Azerbaijan has 
been a key partner in the War on Terror, and 
the two nations share a Trade Relations 
Agreement and a Bilateral Investment Treaty. 
The anniversary of this tragedy is an appro-
priate time to remember the lives of all the 
men, women, and children who were killed, 
and to recommit to working together to pre-
vent such atrocities from occurring again.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
ROBERT DOYLE 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 25, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with Congressman MIKE
THOMPSON, 
Congressman JERRY MCNERNEY, Congress-
man ERIC SWALWELL, Congresswoman BAR-
BARA LEE, and Congressman RO KHANNA to 
recognize the service of an esteemed leader 
in Contra Costa County, Robert Doyle. 
Robert began his career with the East Bay 
Regional Park District in 1973 as a Park 
Ranger. Through decades of hard work and 
devotion to the betterment of our community, 
Robert rose through the ranks of the Park Dis-
trict until being appointed as General Manager 
in 2010. His numerous professional accom-
plishments include increasing the Park Dis-
trict’s public lands and trails by more than 
61,000 acres and obtaining over $100 million 
in local, state, and federal grant funding for 
trail and land projects. Robert also established 
the Resources Enhancement Mitigation Pro-
gram that funded millions of dollars in restora-
tion projects for parks and open space. 
Robert’s work, however, went beyond the 
logistics of land acquisition and was focused 
around the idea that parks should be a haven 
for everyone in the community. As General 
Manager, Robert led efforts to diversify the 
Park District’s user base to better embrace 
disadvantaged youth and other underserved 
populations. Civic engagement was supported 
by a Multicultural Advisory Committee and in-
cluded programs such as the Adventure Crew/ 
Richmond Rangers, Wellness Walks, and the 
school-based Kids Healthy Outdoor Challenge. 
Additionally, the Healthy Parks Health People 
initiative sought to connect the health benefits 
of being outdoors with individuals at high risk 
for chronic illness. The inclusivity of the com-
munity outreach that Robert oversaw has cre-
ated new links between our natural environ-
ment and community members. This in-
creased engagement ensures that our parks

and open spaces will be taken care of and en-
joyed by future generations. As a testament to 
his remarkable career, in March 2018, Robert 
received the President’s Award for Advocacy 
and Advancing the Park Profession from the 
California Park and Recreation Society. 
In addition to his work with the Park District, 
Robert was a founding board member of Save 
Mt. Diablo, Inc. and negotiated the acquisi-
tions of 5,000 acres for Mt. Diablo State Park. 
He was also a founding member of Bay Area 
Open Space, which advocates for environ-
mental conservation through legislation. 
Robert is known by his colleagues as a 
dedicated and visionary leader who inspires 
others to also work for the betterment of our 
community. We have enjoyed working with 
Robert and the East Bay Regional Park Dis-
trict on many projects, including the former 
Concord Naval Weapons Station and Habitat 
Conservation Plan/Natural Community Con-
servation Plan. We thank Robert for his serv-
ice with the East Bay Regional Park District 
and wish him great joy in retirement. Please 
join me, Congressman MIKE THOMPSON, Con-
gressman JERRY
MCNERNEY, Congressman 
ERIC
SWALWELL, Congresswoman BARBARA 
LEE, and Congressman RO KHANNA in hon-
oring Robert for his many contributions to our 
community.
