JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
last night, before a joint session of 
Congress, President Biden laid out a 
comprehensive, thoughtful vision for 
the country. 
First, he spoke about what we have 
accomplished so far, and on that front, 
there was plenty to talk about. 
The Democratic majority in Congress 
passed the most sweeping Federal re-
covery effort in a new generation, the 
American Rescue Plan, accelerating 
the pace of vaccinations and our eco-
nomic rebound. As a result, the United 
States administered more than 200 mil-
lion shots in less than 100 days. More 
than half of American adults have got-
ten at least one shot, and two-thirds of 
American 
seniors 
are 
vaccinated. 
Eighty-five percent of all Americans 
have received a stimulus check of $1,400 
through the American Rescue Plan. 
More than 160 million relief checks 
have been delivered. 
Our economic recovery continues 
apace. The United States created more 
than a million jobs over the past 3 
months—the most new jobs in a Presi-
dent’s first hundred days in American 
history. And just this morning, we 
learned that jobless claims hit a new 
pandemic low for the third straight 
week. Today’s numbers are an indica-
tion that our economy is back on track 
and should be going full throttle. 
America is turning the corner. America 
is turning the corner. 
Over the first quarter, the American 
economy grew by 6.4 percent—6.4 per-
cent. Under President Biden and Demo-
cratic majorities in Congress, America 
is 
turning 
the 
corner—6.4 
percent 
growth, wow. That shows you that 
America is back, and that shows you 
that the kind of strong, active pro-
posals that we Democrats have made 
are the right direction for the country 
and have the support throughout the 
country of Democrats, Independents, 
Republicans because it is the right 
thing to do—the right thing to do. 
The story of the first hundred days is 
a story about shots going into arms, 
checks going into pockets, life getting 
back to normal, and the economy pick-
ing up a lot of steam. After one of the 
most difficult years in history, we have 
made extraordinary progress. 
President Biden spoke last night 
about how and where we can build on 
that strong foundation. We can’t rest. 
We have a lot more to do. We want to 
keep this country going at a strong 
rate of growth, creating new jobs, mak-
ing America healthier. We want to con-
tinue to do that. We are not just going 
to stop with the ARP. We can’t. 
President Biden proposed common-
sense investments and policies that 
will provide a pathway to success for 
working people and for America as a

whole. In particular, the President’s 
focus on jobs, middle-class incomes, 
and helping families and workers suc-
ceed in a 21st-century economy was 
very much welcomed. 
America is breathing a sigh of relief 
to see Joe Biden in that chair and not 
the previous President, who just all too 
often, even in those speeches where he 
was supposed to rise to the occasion, 
appealed to the worst instincts of peo-
ple. 
The 
President’s 
plan—President 
Biden’s plan—will help restore that 
once innate American optimism that 
has really been shaken for the last 4 
years. Now the Congress must act. And, 
as majority leader, I intend for the 
Senate to take up legislation to make 
President Biden’s vision a reality. 
Truthfully, a lot of what President 
Biden proposed last night should be bi-
partisan. Just because a Democratic 
President proposed a jobs and infra-
structure plan doesn’t mean jobs and 
infrastructure are Democratic issues. 
Just because a Democratic President 
proposed a comprehensive plan to ad-
dress childcare and education and 
workforce training doesn’t mean those 
are just Democratic issues. My Repub-
lican colleagues, in one way or an-
other, have joined Democrats on legis-
lation in those subject areas for years. 
President Biden spoke at length 
about the need to outcompete China. 
That is something our two parties have 
long agreed on and a topic the Senate 
will address in the next work period. 
Even on the very difficult subjects 
like police reform, gun safety, immi-
gration, 
bipartisan 
compromise— 
strong bipartisan compromise, strong 
legislation coming out of bipartisan 
compromise—is never out of reach. 
Senator MURPHY continues to discuss 
bipartisan safety measures with Sen-
ator CORNYN
and others. Senators 
BOOKER and DURBIN continue to discuss 
bipartisan policing reform with Sen-
ator SCOTT, KAREN
BASS, Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, and many 
others. 
Just this morning, I met with George 
Floyd’s brother, Eric Garner’s mother, 
and Mr. Ben Crump, the lawyer for the 
family of George Floyd, and I told 
them that we are committed to getting 
meaningful, strong reform done—hope-
fully, in a bipartisan way, if we can. 
Here on the Senate floor, we are 
proving that our two parties can work 
together on legislation, including on 
some of the issues that President Biden 
mentioned. Today’s vote offers a great 
example. This afternoon, the Senate is 
going to vote on a bipartisan water in-
frastructure bill. We have agreed with 
the Republican minority to consider 
several amendments first, including 
three Republican amendments. I prom-
ised my caucus and the country that 
we would try to do things in a more 
open way, where amendments would be 
debated on the floor. We did that last 
week on the anti-Asian hate crimes 
legislation. We are doing it today on 
the water bill, and we hope to do it on 
the 
comprehensive 
America 
COM-
PETES Act when we come back next 
week. 
So the bottom line is very simple: We 
are moving forward wherever we can in 
a bipartisan way. 
I expect the Senate will pass the 
water infrastructure bill with a re-
sounding bipartisan vote after the 
amendments are debated. So let it be a 
signal to our Republican colleagues 
that Senate Democrats want to work 
together on infrastructure when and 
where we can. 
Certainly, the water bill is not the 
only example of bipartisan legislation 
this Congress. As I mentioned, a few 
weeks ago, nearly the entire Senate 
stood together to pass legislation to 
combat 
the 
recent 
surge 
in 
hate 
crimes, particularly against Americans 
of Asian descent, 94 to 1—94 to 1. 
And 
just 
yesterday, 
the 
Senate 
passed, with bipartisan support, a 
measure to reinstate critical rules to 
reduce the emissions of methane into 
our atmosphere. It was the first signifi-
cant action the Senate has taken to 
combat climate change in at least a 
decade, probably much more. 
Even though our two parties have 
been divided in the past on the subject 
of climate change, we can no longer af-
ford to have those differences foil our 
progress. The methane CRA must be 
the first—the first of many steps we 
take to tackle climate change. 
So these past few months have pro-
vided a great example of what the Sen-
ate can do. The American people de-
serve a Congress that works and pro-
duces the kinds of change that Ameri-
cans are demanding. President Biden 
pointed the way. He pointed the way 
forward on a number of issues last 
night. Now it is up to us, here in the 
Senate and in the Congress, to make 
progress, the progress for the American 
people, a reality.

f 
JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
last night, President Biden delivered 
his first address to a joint session of 
Congress, and today marks his 100th 
day in office. 
President Biden is a likeable person. 
Many of us remember serving with him 
in this Chamber. But while the tone of 
his remarks were understated, the con-
tent was anything but. He talked at 
length about competing with China 
without mentioning that he wants to 
cut U.S. defense spending after infla-
tion. Exactly what we cannot do if we 
want to keep pace. 
He talked about immigration with-
out taking any responsibility for the 
border crisis that has his administra-
tion packing unaccompanied children 
into facilities and releasing arrivals 
into our country. 
And the President talked about unity 
and togetherness while reading off a 
multitrillion-dollar shopping list that 
was neither designed nor intended to 
earn bipartisan buy-in, a blueprint for 
giving Washington even more money 
and even more power to micromanage 
American families and build the coun-
try liberal elites want instead of the 
future Americans want. 
Think back to the start of this ad-
ministration. Remember its day one 
priorities: axing a pipeline project that 
would have supported thousands of 
jobs; freezing the exploration behind 
America’s energy independence; and re- 
signing the climate agreement that has 
gotten less emissions reduction out of 
China, which is inside the deal, than 
the United States achieved on our own, 
outside the deal. 
The approach has remained equally 
radical since. Even after the CDC’s own 
experts 
showed 
months 
ago 
that 
schools are safe, the administration’s 
partisan COVID bill threw money at 
districts without requiring prompt re-
openings. 
As a humanitarian crisis mounts at 
the southern border, the President’s 
team has offered mixed messaging and 
ineffectiveness. 
While Iran keeps ramping up nuclear 
rhetoric and financing terror across 
the Middle East, this White House 
keeps downplaying the Iranian terror. 
And they appear eager to squander 
sanctions leverage just to climb back 
into a failed deal from back in the 
Obama era. 
And again, as Russia and China fast- 
track military modernization, Presi-
dent Biden turned in a defense spend-
ing proposal that would put U.S. forces 
behind the curve. 
That was the backdrop for last 
night’s speech. But instead of practical 
plans to fulfill these basic responsibil-
ities, America heard a lengthy liberal 
daydream. We heard about the so- 
called jobs plan packed with punitive 
tax hikes at exactly the time our Na-
tion needs a recovery. Ivy League ex-
perts say that it would actually leave 
American workers with lower wages at 
the end of the day. 
We heard about the so-called family 
plan, another gigantic tax-and-spend 
colossus. Instead of empowering all 
kinds of families with flexibility, this 
one would just subsidize specific paths 
that Democrats deem best so Wash-
ington can call the shots from early 
childhood through college graduation. 
But wait. There was more. There was 
hostility toward the Second Amend-
ment rights of American citizens. 
There was support for Democrats’ 
sweeping election takeover bill that 
would neuter voter ID in all 50 States— 
oh—and, by the way, make the Federal 
Election Commission a partisan body— 
oh—and 
legalize 
ballot 
harvesting, 
where paid political operatives can 
show up carrying stacks, stacks of 
other people’s ballots. 
Here is the bottom line. Recall that 
more than a year ago, at the outset of 
the pandemic, a top House Democrat 
said this crisis provided the left ‘‘a tre-
mendous opportunity to restructure 
things to fit our vision.’’ Well, last 
night, President Biden said much the 
same: that his administration intends 
to turn ‘‘crisis into opportunity.’’ 
The far left certainly gets the mes-
sage. Some of the most liberal Mem-
bers of Congress have gone out of their 
way to say they are surprised and de-
lighted—delighted—by the President’s 
willingness to do things their way. 
Even a neutral wire report explained 
yesterday that the Biden agenda seeks 
to ‘‘fundamentally transform and ex-
pand government’s role in the lives of 
everyday Americans.’’ 
Let me say that again. A neutral 
wire report explained yesterday that 
the Biden agenda seeks to ‘‘fundamen-
tally transform and expand govern-
ment’s role in the lives of everyday 
Americans.’’ 
It is an attempt to continue dragging 
a divided country farther and faster to 
the left. This administration wants to 
jack up taxes in order to nudge fami-
lies toward the kinds of jobs Democrats 
want them to have, in the kinds of in-
dustries Democrats want to exist, with 
the kinds of cars Democrats want them 
to drive, using the kinds of childcare 
arrangements that Democrats want 
them to pursue. These plans aren’t 
about creating options and flexibility 
for Americans; they are about impos-
ing a vision. 
Instead of encouraging work and re-
warding work and helping connect 
more Americans with opportunities to 
work and build their lives, this admin-
istration is working overtime to break 
the link—the link—between work and 
income. They want to break the link 
between work and income. 
Outside observers across the political 
spectrum agree these Democrats are 
unlearning the commonsense, pro-work 
lessons of bipartisan welfare reform 
from back in the nineties. 
This isn’t what the American people 
voted for. This country just elected a 
50–50 Senate, a very closely divided 
House, and a President who talked a 
big game about cutting deals, bringing 
people together, and building bridges. 
But even on subjects as historically bi-
partisan as pandemic relief, voting 
rights, and infrastructure, our Demo-
cratic friends have become addicted to 
divide-and-conquer. 
As our distinguished colleague Sen-
ator TIM SCOTT put it last night: 
They won’t even build bridges . . . to build 
bridges. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. Repub-
licans support actually competing with 
China. Republicans support actually 
helping working families. Republicans 
support actual infrastructure. Ranking 
Member CAPITO and a number of our 
leading Republican colleagues have 
rolled out a multi-hundred-billion-dol-
lar targeted infrastructure proposal. 
Today, in fact, the Senate is set to pass 
bipartisan legislation to help States 
and localities to provide clean and safe 
drinking water. 
Our President will not secure a last-
ing legacy through go-it-alone radi-
calism. He won’t get much done that 
way. It won’t be good for the country. 
And whatever the Democrats do get 
done through partisan brute force will 
be fragile. The American people need 
us to find common ground and to move 
this country forward, and they would 
like for us to do it together.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
S. 914 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, the 
Senator is now considering S. 914, the 
Drinking Water and Wastewater Infra-
structure Act of 2021. This legislation 
was reported unanimously last month 
by the Committee on Environment and 
Public Works on a vote of 20 to 0. 
I rise today to join Senator CAPITO to 
urge our colleagues to join us in voting 
for the adoption of this legislation. The 
legislation will help upgrade our Na-
tion’s drinking water and wastewater 
infrastructure—investments that are 
sorely needed. 
So that our colleagues understand 
the real need for drinking water and 
wastewater investments, let me just 
begin today by sharing a bit of my own 
personal history on these issues and in-
vite our colleagues to maybe recall a 
bit of their own history. 
My sister Sheila and I were born in 
Beckley, WV, a coal mining town in 
the southern part of the State. For 2 of 
the 6 years that our family resided in 
the Mountain State, we lived outside of 
Beckley, a coal mining town, and we 
lived alongside a stream known as Bea-
ver Creek. We lived outside of Beckley 
by a couple of miles. 
Sometimes, my sister and I, along 
with other kids in our tiny community, 
would play on the banks of Beaver 
Creek, chasing frogs, trying to catch 
the small fish that swam there. We 
were never allowed to eat fish caught 
in Beaver Creek, though, and our 
neighbors didn’t eat them either. Why? 
Because we were told in no uncertain 
terms by our parents that it wasn’t 
safe to eat those fish. 
In time, we learned some of the rea-
sons why it wasn’t safe. Some of the 
septic tanks that nearby residents re-
lied upon were not well maintained, 
and as a result, raw sewage and other 
pollution would sometimes end up 
seeping into Beaver Creek. 
My sister Sheila and I would go on to 
grow up in Danville, VA, located right 
along the border with North Carolina. 
Danville, VA, had once been the last 
capital of the Confederacy. By the time 
we got there, it had become the home 
of Dan River Cotton Mills, as well as 
the world’s biggest tobacco market. 
Even our radio station was WBTM, 
World’s Biggest Tobacco Market. We 
lived in what I suppose was a middle- 
class neighborhood just outside of 
town, and we drank water from a well 
in our own backyard that was located 
less than 100 feet from our septic tank. 
My senior year in high school, I was 
fortunate enough to win a Navy ROTC 
scholarship and attended Ohio State 
University. There, in Columbus, OH, we 
drank water provided by the city of Co-
lumbus, which also treated the sewage 
of the city’s close to half a million in-
habitants. 
Several years after graduating from 
Ohio State in 1968 and while deployed 
to Southeast Asia as a naval flight offi-
cer fighting during the Vietnam war, I 
would learn that the Cuyahoga River, 
which flowed through Cleveland, OH, 
had actually caught on fire. I dubbed it 
‘‘the fire heard around the world.’’ It 
served as a wake-up call to our Nation 
to get serious and begin addressing the 
air and water pollution that were all 
too prevalent in much of our country. 
Spurred by this wake-up call, our 
President at the time, Richard Nixon, 
by Executive order and affirmed by the 
Congress, created the Environmental 
Protection Agency in 1970. 
Inspired in part by the burning Cuya-
hoga River and outrage at the indis-
criminate dumping of pollution into 
rivers, streams, and wetlands around 
this country, Congress enacted the 
Clean Water Act in 1972 over the veto 
of then-President Richard Nixon. 
The goals of the Clean Water Act are 
at the same time simple and profound. 
These are the words: to ‘‘restore and 
maintain the chemical, physical, and 
biological integrity of the Nation’s 
waters.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2316 
April 29, 2021 
Let me repeat this: to ‘‘restore and 
maintain the chemical, physical, and 
biological integrity of the Nation’s 
waters.’’ 
In the Clean Water Act, Congress am-
bitiously declared that the waters of 
the United States would be fishable 
and swimmable by 1983 and that there 
would be no more pollution discharged 
into our waters by 1985. 
Two years later, in 1974, then-Presi-
dent Gerald Ford signed the Safe 
Drinking Water Act into law. 
In the years that followed, cities and 
communities across our country ap-
plied to EPA for grant funding to help 
build new drinking water systems and 
improve existing ones. Similarly, with 
the help of EPA grants, communities 
across 
America 
built 
or 
upgraded 
wastewater treatment systems to clean 
up the wastewater being discharged 
into rivers and streams. 
Over time, grant requests greatly ex-
ceeded the funding available through 
EPA grants. During the Reagan admin-
istration, a controversial new approach 
was proposed—the creation of revolv-
ing loan funds administered and man-
aged by each State. After considerable 
debate and compromise, this proposal 
was enacted into law. I was serving in 
the House of Representatives at the 
time and ended up supporting that pro-
posal. Thus, the concept of State re-
volving funds was born in 1987. The 
Clean Water Program was an alter-
native financing mechanism for the 
construction of wastewater facilities. 
Congress extended the same revolving 
loan fund concept to Federal drinking 
water programs in 1996. 
Federal funds seeded revolving funds 
in all 50 States and in Puerto Rico and 
provided support for projects in the 
other territories and in the District of 
Columbia, right here. This Federal sup-
port leveraged State and local funding, 
along with revenues generated by utili-
ties. 
In the years immediately following 
the creation of these funds, Congress 
periodically modified them to meet the 
changing needs in cities and commu-
nities across our country and inspire 
the use of new technologies. 
In more recent years, however, the 
programs languished, and the author-
izations for the State revolving funds 
were in dire need of updating. 
In 2018, for the first time in 22 years— 
22 years—Congress reauthorized the 
Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. 
It did so for 3 years. The Clean Water 
State Revolving Loan Fund, used for 
wastewater and other vital needs, has 
not been reauthorized in nearly—get 
this—35 years, and now the Drinking 
Water State Revolving Fund is set to 
expire at the end of this year. 
Somebody should do something, and 
that somebody is us. Needless to say, 
we 
have 
fallen 
woefully 
short 
of 
Congress’s lofty ambitions to create 
fishable and swimmable waters by 1983 
and to eliminate the discharge of pollu-
tion in navigable waters by 1985. It is 
also clear that the system we have 
now, despite our best efforts, isn’t 
enough to meet the needs of our com-
munities, particularly those who can-
not afford to participate in loan pro-
grams to upgrade increasingly inad-
equate drinking water and wastewater 
facilities. 
For far too many families in this Na-
tion, access to safe, clean drinking 
water and a healthy environment is, 
frankly, a dream, just a dream, and a 
lot of folks, too many folks, face a real 
crisis. 
All too often, we see headlines telling 
of the poor state of water infrastruc-
ture in our country and its lack of re-
silience in the face of severe weather. 
Not that long ago in Texas, earlier this 
year, nearly 15 million people—15 mil-
lion people—lost access to clean water 
when plummeting temperatures broke 
water mains and brought power down 
at drinking water facilities across that 
State. In Jackson, MS, that same 
harsh weather caused over 80 water 
main breaks and left tens of thousands 
of people without water, particularly 
in 
predominantly 
African-American 
neighborhoods. 
But, as we all know, this goes well 
beyond a few isolated cases. The prob-
lem of water in our Nation runs much 
deeper. Millions of Americans still lack 
consistent access to clean drinking 
water today. 
The American Society of Civil Engi-
neers’ 2021 report this year reported 
that 
America’s 
infrastructure—they 
give out grades: A, B, C, D, E, F. They 
gave our water systems a grade of C- 
minus. 
I don’t know about my colleagues, 
but I never got much of a pat on the 
back when I brought home a C-minus 
on my report card, and neither did my 
sister. C-minus is not satisfactory in 
my family or, I think, for our country. 
That same report early this year also 
revealed that there is a water main 
break every 2 minutes—every 2 min-
utes—in the United States and that 6 
billion gallons of treated, drinkable 
water are lost each day to leaks and 
crumbling water supply systems. That 
begs the question: How much is 6 bil-
lion 
gallons, 
anyway? 
Well, 
it 
is 
enough lost water to fill 9,000 swim-
ming pools. Let me repeat that. It is 
enough water to fill 9,000 swimming 
pools—not each year, not each month, 
not each week—every day. Some com-
munities report losing a quarter or 
even half of their drinking water to 
leaking pipes. 
In my own State of Delaware, where 
Senator COONS and I come from, com-
munities like Ellendale, DE, in the 
southern part of our State, struggled 
for years to find and afford safe alter-
natives for increasingly polluted drink-
ing water wells. Ellendale is not alone. 
Thousands in communities of color and 
Tribal 
communities, 
rural 
commu-
nities, and others struggle, not only 
with access to clean water and waste-
water treatment, but also with the ca-
pacity to afford the infrastructure nec-
essary to provide and meet those serv-
ices. 
Let me emphasize: Clean water is an 
essential part of our healthy lives, 
healthy economics, and a healthy envi-
ronment. But for those communities 
who simply cannot afford to pay back 
loans for needed water infrastructure, 
we have to find a better way. 
I think by working across the aisle 
and working hard, our committee—the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee—is suggesting that by way of 
this legislation before us today. 
I am pleased to report that these are 
the challenges that we have sought to 
address head-on with this legislation. 
This bipartisan legislation that we con-
sider today authorizes more than $35 
billion for drinking water and waste-
water infrastructure programs at the 
Environmental Protection Agency over 
the next 5 years. These programs will 
create jobs and make our communities 
healthier by building, by repairing, by 
upgrading, and by modernizing our Na-
tion’s aging drinking water and waste-
water infrastructure systems. 
Here is how. 
First, the measure takes the historic 
step of reauthorizing the Clean Water 
State Revolving Fund for the first time 
in 35 years—35 years. And it does so by 
increased funding levels for the first 
time since 1987. This legislation also 
reauthorizes the Drinking Water State 
Revolving Fund, a program whose au-
thorization expires, I mentioned ear-
lier, at the end of this year. This fund 
helps to ensure that clean water flows 
whenever we turn on our faucet—that 
clean water comes out of it. 
Next, this bill makes sure we are 
helping our fellow Americans most in 
need—the least of these, the most in 
need—by boosting funding for pro-
grams that fund projects in low-income 
areas, rural communities and Tribal 
lands, and communities of color that 
have historically been left behind by 
investments in our water infrastruc-
ture. According to a recent analysis, 
water systems with multiyear Safe 
Drinking Water Act violations are 40 
percent more likely to be in places 
with higher proportions of people of 
color. Drinking water quality viola-
tions are by far the most frequent in 
low-income rural communities, where 
local governments struggle to finance 
the most basic water infrastructure 
needs. 
To help resolve this historic injus-
tice, more than 40 percent of this bill’s 
investments are targeted to help dis-
advantaged communities. Our bill au-
thorizes more than a billion in new 
funding to reduce lead in drinking 
water. And particularly for our coun-
try’s rural areas, Tribal populations 
and low-income neighborhoods, our bill 
invests another billion into programs 
to connect households to drinking 
water and wastewater systems and 
services. 
Wide disparities in opportunity and 
investment are also present in Tribal 
communities. Our legislation grows the 
Tribal Drinking Water Program by 20 
percent and reforms programs to help

Tribal education agencies remove lead 
from their drinking water systems, 
too. 
This legislation does far more than 
just fix what is broken. To borrow a 
phrase from our President, Joe Biden, 
this legislation actually does ‘‘build 
back better’’ by fortifying water infra-
structure for new and worsening cli-
mate realities. 
I will be honest with you, Madam 
President and colleagues. In this coun-
try, ours is a future that promises 
more severe weather events like hurri-
canes, like floods, droughts, and bit-
terly cold weather. It is a future, like 
it or not, with more and more people 
living on the frontlines of sea level 
rise, like my home State of Delaware, 
the lowest lying State in our Nation. 
To that end, the bill provides a com-
bined $500 million to make our water 
infrastructure systems more resilient 
and adaptable in the face of extreme 
weather events. Within that historic 
investment is a new $125 million pro-
gram which will, for the first time, pro-
vide grants to communities seeking to 
fortify 
their 
wastewater 
systems 
against climate change’s impact. 
Finally, with our eyes focused on the 
future, our bill expands government’s 
role in researching and developing the 
water technologies for tomorrow, by 
investing in technologies to improve, 
for example, storm water control and 
waste management. By doing so, we 
can help American companies export 
innovation while not exporting jobs, 
rather by creating them right here. 
This is not just a bill to spend and 
build on but legislation that would di-
rect our Agencies to build and spend 
more wisely. We know that investment 
in innovation, as envisioned in the bill 
before us, can have a profound positive 
impact on our economy, creating jobs 
and fostering growth for our entire Na-
tion. We can, in short, seize the oppor-
tunity in the face of so much adversity. 
As we say in Delaware, ‘‘Carpe diem. 
Seize the day.’’ Actually, we say: ‘‘Car-
per diem. Seize the day.’’ 
There is an old African proverb that 
comes to mind that goes something 
like this: If you want to go fast, travel 
alone. If you want to go far, travel to-
gether. On this bill, I can proudly say 
Senator CAPITO and our colleagues on 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee have chosen to travel to-
gether. The Drinking Water and Waste-
water Infrastructure Act of 2021 passed 
out of the Environment and Public 
Works Committee with a resounding 
vote of 20 to 0. 
And from outside the Halls of Con-
gress, this bill has earned praise from 
across the political spectrum, from big 
cities to small communities. A group of 
government officials that includes the 
U.S. Conference of Mayors wrote that 
this measure will ‘‘help address the 
many water infrastructure challenges 
that communities face. Local leaders 
support the Drinking Water and Waste-
water Infrastructure Act as a reliable, 
long-term and increased federal invest-
ment in water infrastructure.’’ 
Representing 
our 
less-populated 
areas of the country, there are places 
like Raleigh County in West Virginia. 
Raleigh County is where I was born, 
where my sister and I were born. Sen-
ator CAPITO
knows it well. Senator 
MANCHIN
knows it well. His wife is 
from there. Representing places like 
Sussex County in southern Delaware, 
the Rural Community Assistance Part-
nership says this about our legislation: 
‘‘Proud to support this bill because 
Americans deserve clean, safe, reliable, 
and affordable drinking water, regard-
less of the community’s size or zip 
code.’’ I could not agree more. 
We know that access to safe, reliable 
and healthful water isn’t a blue State 
or red State issue. It is an issue that 
goes to the core of the promise afforded 
to every American in Thomas Jeffer-
son’s Declaration of Independence— 
largely penned by Thomas Jefferson— 
with these words: a promise of ‘‘Life, 
Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.’’ 
If we would be honest with ourselves, 
none of us can expect to pursue, much 
less enjoy, this American ideal if we 
don’t have access to clean water to 
drink, because without water we have 
no life. 
The need for action on this issue is 
clear. To that end, I have been grateful 
to the partnership of our ranking mem-
ber, Senator CAPITO. I am proud this 
measure is the very first piece of infra-
structure legislation, I believe, to be 
reported out of a Senate committee in 
this the 117th Congress. The Environ-
mental and Public Works Committee 
has a long tradition, as some know, for 
working across the aisle to get signifi-
cant legislation over the finish line. 
This bill is the latest example of the 
kind of work that we do. 
I would like to say we are work 
horses, not show horses. 
This is the first one that Senator 
CAPITO and I have been able to work on 
together, and I am grateful for all that 
she and her staff have done to help get 
us here to this day. I oftentimes say 
that bipartisan solutions are lasting 
solutions. Think about that: Bipartisan 
solutions are lasting solutions. That is 
how I think we should approach almost 
all of our work here in the Senate—by 
reaching out to our colleagues across 
the aisle, where we can, creating last-
ing solutions to problems and chal-
lenges facing our Nation. This bill be-
fore us today is a product of that kind 
of partnership. 
The legislation is the result of tire-
less, dedicated work by the ranking 
member, Senator CAPITO, by her staff, 
and by my own. I want to thank them 
and every member of our committee 
for all their outstanding, bipartisan 
work and for all their contributions to 
helping us craft this legislation over 
the last several months. 
I especially want to note on my staff: 
John Kane, sitting behind me; Mar-
garet McIntosh, known as ‘‘Mackie’’; 
Tyler Hofmann-Reardon; and our fear-
less 
staff 
director, 
Mary 
Frances 
Repko. And I want to thank another 
member of our team, who used to be a 
part of our EPW team and is now leav-
ing our staff. This is her last day—Ash-
ley Morgan. We want to thank her for 
all her help in the last couple of years. 
I also want to thank Adam Tomlinson 
for his leadership with Ranking Mem-
ber CAPITO and her EPW team, includ-
ing Jess Kramer and Travis Cone. We 
thank them all very, very much. 
Finally, a big shout out to our Water 
Subcommittee 
chair, 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH, for taking the lead to in-
troduce this excellent measure, along 
with Senator CARDIN
and EPW sub-
committee ranking members, Senator 
LUMMIS
of 
Wyoming 
and 
Senator 
CRAMER. It has been a pleasure to work 
with each of you and your staffs. I 
would go so far as to say that it was a 
labor of love. 
With this bill’s level of support, it is 
my hope that we can seize this momen-
tum and pass this measure quickly this 
week. I urge all my colleagues to join 
Senator CAPITO and me in supporting 
this excellent bill. 
Before I yield the floor, I want to re-
flect on last night and the address that 
was brought to us by our President 
from Delaware, Joe Biden, a long-time 
friend and colleague. I was encouraged 
by his remarks. He is not a very par-
tisan person, and I think he reached 
out a hand of friendship to the other 
side of the aisle, in both the House and 
the Senate, to try to work together. 
I am a retired Navy captain, a Viet-
nam veteran, and a big believer in lead-
ership by example. In our committee, 
the Environmental and Public Works 
Committee, 
Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans—Senator 
CAPITO
and, 
before 
that, JOHN BARRASSO; before that, Bar-
bara Boxer and, gosh, JIM INHOFE, as 
chairs of our committee—we have 
sought to provide bipartisan leadership 
and show by example, and we are try-
ing to do that again here today. 
My hope is that, God willing, about a 
month from now, we will bring another 
bill up for a vote for debate in our com-
mittee 
on 
surface 
transportation, 
roads, 
highways, 
and 
bridges, 
and 
maybe continue to set a good example 
for this body and for the administra-
tion and the House, too. 
With that in mind, I am looking for 
Senator CAPITO. I don’t see her on the 
floor, but I do see the whip, my friend 
Senator THUNE. I think maybe I should 
yield to him. 
I should tell you guys that Senator 
THUNE and I, almost every Thursday, 
are joined with the Chaplain of the 
U.S. Senate, Barry Black, a retired ad-
miral who is Chaplain of the Senate 
now. He is good enough to host a Bible 
study in his office space. We usually 
end up sitting there. It is one of my fa-
vorite parts of the week. 
Almost every week he reminds us of 
Matthew 25. Senator THUNE knows the 
Bible better than most pastors. It is 
true. Senate Chaplain Barry Black will 
oftentimes remind us of Matthew 25. It 
starts like this: ‘‘When I was thirsty, 
you would give me to drink.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2318 
April 29, 2021 
We have, I think, a moral imperative 
to act on this legislation, to make it 
better, and to be able to hammer out a 
compromise with the House and the ad-
ministration. There is a moral impera-
tive to pass legislation of this nature. 
There is also a fiscal imperative. I 
spoke about filling up how many thou-
sands of swimming pools from one 
water leakage a day. 
There is a health imperative here in 
the middle of the worst health crisis in 
200 years. 
There is an economic imperative, as 
well. It is hard to foster economic 
growth and development in commu-
nities where wastewater is not treated 
and there is drinking water you can’t 
drink. Who wants to set up a business 
and go into business in places like 
that? 
There are a lot of reasons we need to 
embrace this legislation, make it bet-
ter if we can, and send it off to the 
House and get it to conference. 
We have been joined by a new Pre-
siding Officer. He has just joined us 
straight from New Jersey. For many 
years, he, Senator BOOKER, has joined 
us in our Bible study. He, Senator 
DUCKWORTH, and I formed a caucus that 
is designed to make sure we don’t over-
look the least of these, and I salute 
him for his leadership and good work in 
that regard. 
With that, I see Senator CAPITO here. 
I am not sure if I should yield to the 
whip, Senator THUNE, or yield to her. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The Senator from South Da-
kota. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would 
echo what my colleague from Delaware 
has said about the Chaplain’s Bible 
study on a weekly basis. That, I think, 
is 
the 
highlight 
for 
many 
of 
us 
throughout the week. 
I would also say that the Senator 
from Delaware also has a very good 
command of the Holy Scriptures, and I 
appreciate the opportunity that he and 
I and others have, on a weekly basis, to 
participate in that study and would en-
courage other Members to join us. It is 
truly an inspirational time and is 
something that, I think, we all need 
with the busyness that we have on a 
weekly basis here in the Senate. 
(The remarks of Senator THUNE per-
taining to the introduction of S. 1458 
and S. 1475 are printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Statements on Intro-
duced Bills and Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. THUNE. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
STATE WATER RIGHTS AMENDMENT 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, water is one 
of our most precious resources, and it 
is vital to life. It is necessary for agri-
culture, industry, recreation, conserva-
tion, the development and growth of 
cities, and so many aspects of our day- 
to-day lives. Unfortunately, for States 
like Utah—States with a lot of Federal 
land and States that are dry in many 
areas—our supply for this critical re-
source, water, is threatened under the 
Antiquities Act. 
Why is this the case? Well, let’s re-
view the background. 
Back in 1908, the Supreme Court con-
cluded that, when the Federal Govern-
ment reserves land for an Indian res-
ervation, it also implicitly reserves 
sufficient water on that land to fulfill 
the purposes of the reservation, cre-
ating the ‘‘Federal reserved water 
rights’’ doctrine. In later cases, the 
Court expanded that doctrine to apply 
to other Federal properties—other Fed-
eral properties like national forests 
and recreation areas. 
Then, in 1976, the Supreme Court 
held that the doctrine applied to na-
tional 
monuments 
created 
by 
the 
President. In other words, it affirmed 
the President’s authority unilaterally 
to change the legal water rights within 
a State simply by designating a monu-
ment under the Antiquities Act. 
Now, under the Antiquities Act, the 
President has the authority and the 
discretion to create a monument, as 
long as there is Federal land. So it 
makes a State like mine, 67 percent of 
which is owned by the Federal Govern-
ment, a sitting duck for abuse. 
Now, we have talked about Antiq-
uities Act abuses in other contexts. 
Here, I am focusing in on a very narrow 
ramification of Antiquities Act abuse, 
which relates to water rights. It is only 
that narrow ramification that I am 
trying to address with this amend-
ment. 
Monument designations can be and 
often are made without the approval of 
the State and its inhabitants. And, un-
fortunately, in recent years, these des-
ignations have grown rather signifi-
cantly in size and in scope. 
The result for public land States, like 
Utah, is involved in access and use to 
the water supply being significantly 
curtailed. In some cases, privately held 
water rights are even terminated alto-
gether, and it opens up the door to 
even greater abuse under the Antiq-
uities Act down the road. 
Imagine for a moment if a proposal 
for a national monument were des-
ignated in just one river basin, such as 
the Grand Canyon. In order to preserve 
the flow of water on the Colorado River 
through the Grand Canyon, water 
rights—legally 
established, 
long-
standing, 
long-established 
water 
rights—could 
be 
eliminated, 
com-
pletely eliminated in Colorado, in 
Utah, in Arizona, in Nevada, in Cali-
fornia through the stroke of the execu-
tive pen. 
A reservation of water could reduce 
or eliminate drinking water for com-
munities across the West. It could 
eliminate irrigation water for almonds 
or grapes in California or Sudan grass 
in Utah. The perils are endless. 
That is why I am introducing an 
amendment that would prevent the 
President from unilaterally creating 
reserved water rights when designating 
a national monument. 
Now, it is important for me to men-
tion—now that I have explained what 
this amendment would do, I want to 
talk about what it would not do. 
My amendment would not prevent 
the President from creating a national 
monument itself. And, furthermore, it 
would still allow for water rights to be 
acquired for a monument through the 
State system in which the water rights 
themselves reside. 
It would simply and fairly give 
States a say in the process, regardless 
of how you feel about national monu-
ments or about the Antiquities Act. I 
have made clear in the past I have got 
grave concerns with the Antiquities 
Act, and I believe it needs to be re-
pealed. This bill does not do that. This 
bill simply cabins off water rights and 
says that water rights need to be han-
dled through the legal process to which 
they would otherwise be handled, to 
which they would otherwise be sub-
jected. 
This is a simple, commonsense solu-
tion to ensure that Utah and other 
States where there is a lot of Federal 
public land are guaranteed the protec-
tion of their existing water rights and 
a reliable water supply. It would be 
easy to dismiss or denigrate or down-
play the importance of this if you live 
in a State where there is not much 
Federal land. But if you live in a State 
like mine, where most of the land is 
owned by the Federal Government, you 
can understand how quickly this could 
become destructive, if abused, and that 
is exactly why we need this amend-
ment. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, my 
neighbor, I want to take a few minutes 
this morning—additional minutes this 
morning to discuss the water issues 
facing rural America, and the Pre-
siding Officer comes from the Garden 
State, and a lot of people who have 
heard Senator COONS
and me talk 
about our State think of us as the 
poultry State. We think, for about 
every person who lives in Delaware, we 
have got about 300 chickens. We raise a 
lot of the corn and soybeans to feed 
those chickens. So almost every State 
is a rural State in one way or the 
other. 
But the issues facing rural America 
often do not get the same level of at-
tention or assistance with drinking 
water and wastewater programs that 
larger, more urban or suburban areas 
receive. 
As our Committee on Environment 
and Public Works was drafting the 
Drinking Water and Wastewater Infra-
structure Act of 2021, the legislation 
before us today, many of us focused on 
the need to invest in small, rural, and 
disadvantaged 
communities 
because 
they often—to be honest with you, 
often get left behind. 
These communities are overlooked or 
overburdened when it comes to ad-
dressing the drinking water and waste-
water needs of their residents too 
often.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2319 
April 29, 2021 
Most of our country’s drinking water 
and wastewater utilities are small. Ap-
proximately, 80 percent of the coun-
try’s almost 17,000 wastewater utilities 
serve a population of fewer than 10,000 
people. More than 90 percent of the 
country’s 43,000 community water sys-
tems serve a population of fewer than 
10,000 people. 
Small and rural communities have 
more difficulty affording public water 
service. These communities lack the 
population density needed to finan-
cially support a public drinking water 
system, and if they have managed to 
build a system, they often lack the 
people to properly staff it. 
In fact—I was shocked to hear this, 
but 43 percent of small water systems 
are operated and staffed by one person, 
by one single person. Forty-three per-
cent of small water systems are oper-
ated and staffed by one person. 
These rural towns’ and villages’ 
drinking systems face the same chal-
lenges as large systems, larger sys-
tems, in making sure that water is 
safe, making sure the water is clean, 
making sure that the water is reliable. 
Complicating matters, these commu-
nities have to do it with far fewer re-
sources, in many instances. 
I want to share just a couple of exam-
ples of challenges facing these commu-
nities just from my own home State, 
and I am sure every Member of this 
body can provide examples in their own 
States. 
For example, there is a town called 
Selbyville. It is right on the Delaware- 
Maryland line, not too far from Reho-
both Beach and Dewey and Bethany 
Beaches. But Selbyville is currently 
operating without a fully licensed 
water treatment operator due to the 
death of a longtime operator who 
passed away after a long battle with 
cancer. The only other licensed oper-
ator for the town is currently out on 
disability, and the remaining two oper-
ators are not fully licensed. 
Through the Technical Assistance 
Program that this bill would reauthor-
ize, the town has been able to obtain 
the required training to prepare the 
two partially licensed operators for the 
State licensing exam. 
This program has helped to train 
these individuals in areas like disinfec-
tion control, filtration, provide the on-
site technical assistance for leak detec-
tion and hydrant maintenance. 
Another example, the Pepper Ridge 
Mobile Park in Frankford, DE—not too 
far away—suffered many years of wa-
terline breakage, low water pressure, 
no hydrants, valves, levers, and inad-
equate distribution lines. 
The Delaware Rural Water Associa-
tion, through our State revolving fund, 
was able to obtain funds to do a full 
water line upgrade. 
And incidentally, we will also reau-
thorize this program at an increased 
level of funding. 
This legislation before us today spe-
cifically helps rural and smalltown 
America by reauthorizing critical pro-
grams like the ones I just mentioned in 
my own State and by adjusting the 
cost share for these communities to 
make these infrastructure upgrades 
more affordable to ratepayers. 
Passing this legislation will be an 
important step toward addressing the 
overwhelming infrastructure needs of 
43,000 water systems in rural commu-
nities, many of which have one person 
operating that system. 
According to the most recent EPA 
drinking water infrastructure assess-
ment, rural drinking water needs are 
currently estimated at $74 billion over 
the next 20 years, including $3.3 billion 
just for Indian Country. 
To help rural communities, this bill 
expands drinking water technical as-
sistance opportunities for rural com-
munities by authorizing more than $75 
million in technical assistance grants. 
We have been joined on the floor by 
the prime author of this legislation, 
the Senator from Illinois, and I am just 
going to stop where I am in my dis-
course on rural American water needs 
of a lot of our rural communities and 
to yield the floor, unless Senator CAP-
ITO—no. Senator DUCKWORTH. 
I 
just 
want 
to 
thank 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH for being the prime sponsor 
of this legislation, for allowing the rest 
of us—we have a big racetrack, Dover 
Downs NASCAR track, we use the term 
‘‘drafting,’’ when one car gets really 
close behind the other and kind of 
holds on, but we want to thank Senator 
DUCKWORTH for allowing the rest of us 
to draft on her legislation that she and 
Senator LUMMIS from Wyoming have 
introduced, and we are grateful for her 
leadership. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
remember sitting in a House Oversight 
Committee hearing years ago on the 
Flint water crisis. At the time, my old-
est daughter Abigail was just a year 
old. 
I remember looking out into the au-
dience and seeing just a hand holding a 
baby bottle up from the middle of a 
crowd in that hearing room. That baby 
bottle looked exactly like the one that 
my own baby drank out of. It was a lit-
tle bottle with a pink top. 
But unlike my daughter’s bottle, the 
water in this one was brown, a muddy, 
murky brown. 
I couldn’t, and all these years later I 
still can’t, begin to imagine what it 
would have been like to have to drink 
that water while I was pregnant or to 
have no choice but to give it to my 
baby because the system that I trusted 
to provide my family with clean, safe 
drinking water had failed me. 
But that kind of nightmare remains 
the everyday reality for far, far too 
many parents across this country. 
It has been 7 years since the leaders 
of the city of Flint tried to save a few 
dollars by swapping out its drinking 
water supply from Detroit’s system to 
the Flint River, setting off a chain of 
events that poisoned nearly 9,000 kids 
in just 18 months. 
But the damage inflicted on that 
community will never go away, and 
while Flint was a tragedy, it was not 
an anomaly. According to both the 
EPA and CDC, there is no known safe 
level of lead in a child’s blood. Yet 
more than 6 million homes continue to 
get water from lead service lines, in-
cluding in my own home State of Illi-
nois, which has more known lead serv-
ice lines than any other State in the 
country. 
And despite lead service lines being 
banned nearly 35 years ago, as of 2019, 
roughly half a million children under 
the age of 6 still had elevated levels of 
lead in their blood—something that 
can cause permanent brain damage. 
And lead is just one of the many 
issues that communities struggle with 
every day due to our outdated and di-
lapidated water systems. 
But instead of working to address 
these known issues, the Federal Gov-
ernment’s share of capital spending in 
the water sector fell from 63 percent in 
1977 to a meager 9 percent in 2017. 
And now, our dwindling Federal and 
State investments into our water infra-
structure are allowing countless Amer-
icans to be exposed to pollutants, 
whether it is from taking a sip from 
their kitchen faucets or even just liv-
ing near an outdated stormwater sys-
tem. 
Part of the problem with water infra-
structure is that it is expensive and no 
one sees it—out of sight, out of mind. 
But that only lasts until there is a 
major problem, like in Texas, where 
over 15 million people were tempo-
rarily left without access to clean 
water. 
Well, we have to stop waiting for our 
infrastructure to fail before we invest 
in it. We cannot wait around for an-
other crisis to sicken our families be-
fore we decide to put real State and 
Federal dollars into rebuilding our 
drinking water and wastewater sys-
tems. 
Imagine if your child was one of 
those who had gotten sick because leg-
islators refused to take action on such 
an obvious crisis. Imagine if you had to 
be the one to get your newborn to sip 
on water too opaque to see through. 
We should not let even one more par-
ent suffer through that worst-case sce-
nario. Access to clean water is a 
human right, and every American de-
serves access to clean water, no matter 
their ZIP Code, the color of their skin, 
or the size of their income. 
It is long, long past time that we 
turn that right into a reality by invest-
ing in the kinds of projects that would 
put Americans back to work rebuilding 
our crumbling water infrastructure. We 
must dramatically increase Federal in-
vestments to provide every family ac-
cess to the most basic human needs— 
clean water. 
That is one reason why I introduced 
the Drinking Water and Wastewater In-
frastructure Act of 2021. If our Nation

S2320 
April 29, 2021 
truly wants to build back better, we 
can’t only pour money into fixing our 
roads while failing to repair the pipes 
beneath them. 
Because water infrastructure is infra-
structure, everyone needs it in every 
corner of this country. 
My bipartisan bill would invest sig-
nificant Federal dollars to help States, 
communities, and schools fix and up-
grade aging water systems to improve 
water quality, while fostering eco-
nomic growth throughout the country. 
Our legislation seeks to reauthorize 
and 
enhance 
State 
revolving 
loan 
funds, which are the most effective 
tools we have to provide States with 
Federal 
investments 
that 
empower 
local leaders to modernize water sys-
tems, 
implement 
lead 
reduction 
projects, and rebuild stormwater over-
flow infrastructure. 
Our bill would also continue getting 
shovels into the ground and support 
quality 
jobs 
by 
reauthorizing 
the 
WIFIA financing program, an initiative 
that already helped finance nearly $20 
billion 
for 
water 
infrastructure 
projects and created 49,000 jobs in just 
under 7 years. 
It would provide more than $700 mil-
lion in lead testing and reduction pro-
grams, in part through a program very 
close to my heart, the voluntary lead 
testing in schools and childcare facili-
ties program, expanding it to go be-
yond testing to include lead reduction. 
Of course, it is not sufficient to sim-
ply 
increase 
investment 
levels—we 
must enact policies that effectively 
distribute critical dollars in a fair and 
just manner that prioritizes the most 
vulnerable Americans, and the most 
pressing 
public 
health 
and 
safety 
needs. 
That is why my bipartisan legisla-
tion prioritizes environmental justice 
by providing direct help to small, dis-
advantaged, rural and tribal commu-
nities that have been ignored for far 
too long. 
By lowering non-Federal cost-shares, 
creating new grants and allowing for 
debt forgiveness, we can help commu-
nities that typically struggle to afford 
traditional 
loans. 
This 
includes 
Centerville, IL, a community that 
needs resources to kick start projects 
that will rebuild their catastrophically 
failing systems that allow sewage to 
seep 
into 
my 
constituents’ 
homes 
whenever it rains. 
Look, we must face the awful reality 
that a community’s racial and eco-
nomic composition are the top predic-
tors of waste facility locations—and we 
should be outraged that these environ-
mental justice communities are often 
neglected in favor of wealthy areas 
that are home to rate payers that can 
cover the cost of safe water. 
Congress cannot abandon American 
communities simply because they can-
not afford to update their water infra-
structure . . . especially when we know 
that the Federal Government failed to 
prevent this crisis from happening. 
Concerns about the health effects of 
lead pipes date back all the way back 
to the late 1800’s—yet Congress didn’t 
ban the use of lead service lines until 
1986! And even then, the Federal Gov-
ernment allowed lead pipes already in 
the ground to remain . . . forcing too 
many of our communities to essen-
tially drink through a ‘‘lead straw’’ to 
this very day. 
We helped create this problem. Now, 
it’s on us to help fix it. 
Our mission lies right before us: work 
together to protect the health of our 
most vulnerable neighbors and achieve 
a 
reality 
where: 
no 
elementary- 
schooler is scared to use their school’s 
drinking fountain; 
no parent questions whether it’s safe 
to give their child a glass of water be-
fore bedtime; and 
no family comes to expect that their 
house will be flooded by sewage every 
time it rains. 
At the end of the day, it’s simple the 
condition of our water infrastructure is 
a crisis. It is a crisis that is daunting, 
yes, and devastating, certainly—yet 
it’s a crisis that is solvable. Every dol-
lar we spend improving our water sys-
tems can help save the health of our fu-
ture generations. And that is why I 
hope my colleagues will join me in vot-
ing yes on the Drinking Water and 
Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1471, AS MODIFIED, TO 
AMENDMENT NO. 1460 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will be 2 min-
utes for remarks equally divided prior 
to a vote on amendment No. 1471, as 
modified. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. 
RUBIO. 
Mr. 
President, 
this 
amendment No. 1471 is our amendment, 
and it would modernize the formula by 
which this money is distributed. 
This formula is 34 years old. It privi-
leges a handful of States over the vast 
majority—I think the number is 15 
over the other 35. And it is not just me 
saying it; the EPA issued a report that 
stated that the current formula does 
not meet the wastewater needs of all of 
the States and recommended that it be 
updated regularly. Notably, from the 
EPA’s report, it says that the EPA 
does not know how the current allot-
ment formula was developed. It says: 
The weighting and factors that were used 
to establish the formula for the original al-
lotment are not known. 
My home State of Florida is one of 
many that are disadvantaged under the 
current formula, and the result has 
been obvious over the years. 
I think most of my colleagues would 
agree that distributing funds—let alone 
$14.4 billion—to States without rhyme 
or reason is not beneficial and isn’t 
fair. 
It is not just States, by the way. This 
amendment, if passed, would secure 
more equitable allotments to Native 
American Tribes and territories. 
Unfortunately, I made—in our draft-
ing of this amendment, there was a 
small technical error in which, instead 
of stating that it should be 0.025 in the 
distribution 
for 
Native 
American 
Tribes, it says .0025. 
So I ask unanimous consent to fur-
ther modify amendment No. 1471 with 
the changes that are at the desk so 
that the right number is on there. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to 
object, I cannot agree to this unani-
mous consent request because this is 
the exact reason why we don’t amend 
complicated formulas on the floor with 
limited oversight. 
This bill was hotlined last night, I 
think, with the current language from 
Senator RUBIO, and now he would like 
to change it here literally at the last 
moment. With all due respect, I just 
cannot agree to that. 
I said to him in a conversation on the 
floor that I think he knows me well 
enough that I am willing to work with 
him and others who would like to see 
some modifications in this formula 
going forward. This is not the end of 
the trail. We will have a conference 
with the House. We will have negotia-
tions with the White House. 
I just want to say to Senator RUBIO 
that I look forward to working with 
him and Senator CAPITO to consider 
the changes that he is proposing but 
not to do it at the last minute here on 
the floor. I am unable to do that. 
I reluctantly object, but I am going 
to have to do that. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, in my re-
maining time— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has no time remaining. 
Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent 
for an additional 30 seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I just 
want to state that we are not changing 
the formula. There is an extra zero, 
and it is literally a typo, the kind of 
typo people make every single day in 
the Senate. Instead of saying ‘‘.025,’’ it 
says ‘‘.0025.’’ Everyone knows what it 
was intended to do. That is the way we 
talked about it. That has been objected 
to. The Senate is now a place where 
you cannot amend a typo by unani-
mous consent. That is unbelievable. It 
is unreal. I, frankly, find it unaccept-
able. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, our 
committee has worked on this legisla-
tion all year. We have had hearings. We 
have had meetings, discussions at the 
staff level and Member level to try to 
come to an agreement on all kinds of 
provisions to the bill, and we are pre-
pared to do more of that once this leg-
islation is adopted. 
But we reported this bill unani-
mously because it will benefit citizens 
across our Nation, better ensuring 
that, no matter where they live, they 
will have access to clean and safe 
water.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2321 
April 29, 2021 
Our bill ensures that every State, 
territory, and Tribe will receive more 
funding to make critical investments 
in clean water projects. But by pro-
posing a formula that only takes popu-
lation growth into account—only takes 
population growth into account—Sen-
ator RUBIO and Senator SCOTT’s amend-
ment will ensure that many States, in-
cluding rural States, territories, and 
Indian Tribes, will lose water infra-
structure funding, in some cases as 
much as 80 percent. 
We cannot afford to take money 
away from these governments when 
their needs are so great, especially in 
communities that have historically 
been 
underfunded 
and 
underserved. 
That is why more than 50 different or-
ganizations, from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce to the League of Conserva-
tion Voters and a whole lot of others in 
between, oppose this amendment. 
As a result, I ask unanimous consent 
to have printed in the RECORD a list of 
those organizations—a growing list of 
those organizations. 
There being no objection, the mate-

see if we can come to a consensus on 
these changes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to address this for 
a minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. CAPITO. I just want to join 
with Senator CARPER in opposition to 
this amendment. While I think it is 
well-meaning for the State of Florida, 
and I think that both Senator RUBIO 
and Senator SCOTT have made us aware 
of this issue, I think that in order to 
update these formulas, we should have 
hearings. We should actually do this in 
a more studied, more detailed way than 
this amendment presents for us to do. 
With that, I join my colleague and 
my chair in opposition to this amend-
ment.

Mr. CARPER. I yield time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I call 
up amendment 1461, and I want to 
thank Senators COLLINS, GILLIBRAND, 
KING, ROUNDS, and PETERS for cospon-
soring this amendment and also thank 
Chairman CARPER and Ranking Mem-
ber CAPITO for their support for the 
amendment. 
As we all know, you can’t put a price 
on safe drinking water, but for too 
many 
communities 
and 
too 
many 
households in this country, costs are a 
real barrier to contamination. 
This bipartisan amendment will help 
States address pollution not just from 
regulated contaminants like arsenic 
but also from unregulated contami-
nants like PFAS. It does this by ex-
panding an existing grant program to 
help small and disadvantaged commu-
nities, not just those defined as under-
served. It would also help households 
with private wells. 
We have to provide more tools to en-
sure that all Americans have access to 
clean, safe drinking water. My amend-
ment would do just that. I urge its 
adoption, and I would be very happy to 
have this done by voice vote.

ator from Maine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2322 
April 29, 2021 
SHAHEEN’s amendment. I urge its adop-
tion. 
Representing, as I do, a State where 
there are a great number of people who 
receive their drinking water from 
wells, it is really important that we ex-
tend this program to identify contami-
nants there. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the 
Shaheen-Collins 
amendment 
makes 
changes to the State Response to Con-
taminants Program. Specifically, the 
amendment expands the provisions for 
the State Response to Contaminants 
Program from covering just under-
served communities to also small and 
disadvantaged communities, to allow 
communities that are financially un-
stable, which cannot afford to address 
contaminants, or small, which means 
less than 10,000 people in population, to 
qualify for grants to address contami-
nants in the drinking water. 
This is a good amendment, and we 
thank the sponsor and also join here in 
cosponsoring. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote and a 
voice vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I would 
also join in the positive comments to 
say this meets two issues that I care 
deeply about and certainly hit my 
State, which is the PFAS issue and 
also small and disadvantaged commu-
nities. It very much helps with safe and 
clean drinking water. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak in support of Senate 
amendment No. 1461, which I have of-
fered to expand a key program that 
helps address contaminated drinking 
water. But before I do, I would like to 
commend Senator DUCKWORTH, Chair-
man CARPER, and Ranking Member 
CAPITO for developing the bipartisan 
legislation currently before the Senate, 
the Drinking Water and Wastewater In-
frastructure Act. This bipartisan bill 
will invest more than $35 billion for 
water infrastructure across the coun-
try. This can’t come soon enough for 
States like New Hampshire. 
Like most States, New Hampshire is 
suffering from aging infrastructure, 
much of it is between 50–100 years old. 
And unfortunately, our State govern-
ment and municipalities simply do not 
have the ability to fully fund the hun-
dreds of millions of dollars needed to 
address the rising costs of failing infra-
structure, 
population 
growth, 
and 
changes in regulation. Communities 
across the country are facing similar 
financial challenges. 
That is why Congress must pass 
sweeping legislation to tackle our Na-
tion’s water infrastructure problems, 
build climate-resilient systems, and 
ensure that all Americans have access 
to clean and safe water. The Drinking 
Water and Wastewater Infrastructure 
Act is a good first step, and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to do more. 
The amendment I am offering today 
with Senators COLLINS, GILLIBRAND, 
KING, ROUNDS, and PETERS will help 
more people impacted by drinking 
water contaminants, including those 
who rely on wells. While America’s 
drinking water is among the safest in 
the world, unregulated contaminants, 
such as PFAS, are increasingly being 
detected in drinking water across the 
country. This is a problem in par-
ticular for New Hampshire’s southern 
cities and towns, including Merrimack, 
Londonderry, Portsmouth, and Dover. 
It is not just unregulated contami-
nants. Pollutants and known carcino-
gens like arsenic, radon, iron, and man-
ganese have been found in New Hamp-
shire groundwater sources at levels 
that threaten public health. According 
to the New Hampshire Department of 
Environmental 
Services, 
approxi-
mately 98,000 Granite Staters who uti-
lize private wells have unsafe levels of 
arsenic in their water. 
As I have heard again and again, dis-
covering that you have been drinking 
contaminated water can produce a 
range of emotions, from anger and fear 
to guilt. It is heartbreaking to hear 
stories of parents worried about what 
their kids’ exposure will mean for their 
health. I am committed to finding 
every opportunity to improve this situ-
ation. That is why I am proposing to 
expand a key part of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s Assistance 
for Small and Disadvantaged Commu-
nities Program to help States respond 
to water contamination in more places. 
I want to make clear that States 
have flexibility to support a range of 
projects to address contaminants in-
cluding in underground sources of 
drinking water, which will help house-
holds relying on well water. In New 
Hampshire, a little over half of our 
population gets its drinking water 
from public water systems that provide 
water from lakes, rivers, and wells. The 
remainder get their water from resi-
dential wells. All of them deserve 
healthy and safe drinking water. My 
amendment will help do just that. And 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
As I said at the outset, this bill we 
have before us today is a good step in 
addressing our water infrastructure 
needs, but there is more to be done. 
For instance, Congress must address 
outstanding issues affecting water in-
frastructure financing. The 2017 tax 
law repealed a longstanding incentive 
under section 118 of the Internal Rev-
enue Code known as the Contributions 
in Aid of Construction exemption, or 
CIAC. Communities across New Hamp-
shire have been planning projects for 
years that are now threatened by these 
tax changes. For example, the Hamp-
stead Area Water Company reports 
that it is facing a $1.5 million tax bill 
on an infrastructure project aimed at 
providing more customers access to 
clean drinking water. And what is 
worse, these tax increase may be 
passed on to utility customers, increas-
ing their water bills. That is why I 
have filed an amendment to undo these 
harmful changes, so that our Tax Code 
once again encourages these critical 
investments. I look forward to working 
with my colleagues to fix this. 
We must also provide increased sup-
port for water systems in small rural 
communities across the country that 
are struggling as a result of this pan-
demic. 
The 
financial 
impacts 
of 
COVID–19 on systems serving 10,000 
people or fewer is estimated to be at 
least $3.6 billion. Yet no support for 
small rural water and wastewater sys-
tems has been included in COVID relief 
legislation to date. That is why I have 
joined with Senator TILLIS to intro-
duce the Emergency Assistance for 
Rural Water Systems Act, legislation 
that would provide critical funding to 
small and rural communities during 
this challenging time. 
Finally, we must address PFAS con-
tamination and its effects on our com-
munities. As many of us know, PFAS 
chemicals 
impact 
drinking 
water 
sources in and around military bases, 
manufacturing 
sites, 
airports, 
and 
other places across the country due to 
their widespread use in firefighting 
foam and consumer products. In my 
State of New Hampshire, the city of 
Portsmouth closed a major water sup-
ply well at the former Pease Air Force 
Base due to PFAS in the drinking 
water. And several communities in 
southern New Hampshire are strug-
gling with groundwater PFAS contami-
nation near the Saint-Gobain plant in 
Merrimack. 
Residents 
near 
the 
Coakley Landfill Superfund site in 
North Hampton and Greenland are con-
cerned about high levels of PFAS found 
in nearby surface waters. 
We owe it to the American families 
in New Hampshire and across the coun-
try who live and work near sites con-
taminated by these materials to invest 
at the scale necessary to fix the prob-
lem. That is why I have championed 
legislation, the PFAS Testing and 
Treatment Act, which would deliver ro-
bust Federal resources to support State 
efforts to address PFAS through reme-
diation and clean up. I hope to work 
with the chairman and ranking mem-
ber, as well as House and Senate lead-
ers, to move this proposal forward. 
Access to safe, clean drinking water 
is essential. While I am only seeking a 
vote on amendment No. 1461 today, I 
will continue to work on all of these 
issues. I look forward to passage of the 
Drinking Water and Wastewater Infra-
structure Act and continuing to work 
to address these outstanding issues in 
future infrastructure bills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2323 
April 29, 2021 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to 
talk 
briefly 
about 
boil 
water 
advisories. They are more than just 
frustrating. They are more than just 
inconvenient. They can be dangerous. 
I don’t know about the Presiding Of-
ficer’s community or my colleagues’ 
communities, but they have been hap-
pening more and more frequently in 
Louisiana. Since 2005, we have had 9,661 
boil water advisories. We had 1,600 of 
them last year alone. 
I thank the EPW Committee for 
working with me and all of my col-
leagues. My amendment would require 
the EPA to provide us an annual study 
on the prevalence of these boil water 
advisories and the reasons therefor so 
we can decide whether to take action, 
if any. 
I would appreciate my colleagues’ 
support. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of Senator KENNEDY’s amend-
ment because we need to know more 
about boil orders, something that I, 
frankly, hadn’t heard a lot about. I 
thank the Senator for bringing it to 
our attention. 
We are in support of this amendment. 
These are frequently used, and trans-
parency is needed on them. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator KENNEDY for this. I pull up my 
local newspaper, and the first thing 
that comes up is listing the boil water 
advisories. This is absolutely needed. I 
think it is a great idea. I am very much 
in support of this.

OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
The amendment (No. 1469) was agreed 
to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1472 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1460 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to the vote in relation to amendment 
No. 1472. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
in opposition to this amendment by 
Senator LEE. His amendment would 
amend the Antiquities Act to prohibit 
the President from reserving water 
when designating a national monu-
ment. 
The amendment states that any 
water rights associated with a national 
monument may only be acquired under 
State law. The Lee amendment over-
turns decades of Supreme Court prece-
dent that when a President designates 
a national monument under the Antiq-
uities Act, the designation reserves the 
right to use enough water to fulfill the 
purpose of the monument. 
But the water infrastructure bill is 
not the appropriate place for this 
amendment. I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this amendment. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, we yield 
back our time. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1472

EXTENDING 
TEMPORARY 
EMER-
GENCY 
SCHEDULING 
OF 
FENTANYL ANALOGUES ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are 
in the midst of the worst opioid epi-
demic in a generation, and one tragic 
aspect of this is the widespread use of 
fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has 
killed thousands of people in America. 
In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration took the unprecedented 
step of placing all fentanyl-related sub-
stances, 
also 
known 
as 
fentanyl 
analogs, on schedule I under the Con-
trolled Substances Act. That makes it 
easier to prosecute any individual who 
sells or even simply possesses fentanyl 
analogs, and it subjects those individ-
uals to stiff mandatory minimum pen-
alties regardless of individual cir-
cumstances. Typically, a drug is only 
added to schedule I after the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
conducts a scientific study to deter-
mine if it has a high potential for 
abuse and no accepted medical use. 
The DEA has had the temporary au-
thority to bypass this process for 2 
years. The authority was scheduled to 
expire on February 6 of last year, 2020. 
The DEA warned us of the dire con-
sequences if it expired. In response, I 
worked with Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM 
and Senator FEINSTEIN and authored 
legislation extending the authority for 
15 months, until May 6, 2021. 
So what did the Trump administra-
tion do for the 12 months that it was in 
office with this issue still looming? 
Nothing and neither did Congress. 
Now the Biden administration has 
asked Congress for an additional exten-
sion of the DEA’s temporary authority 
in order to evaluate this issue. Just 
last week, the Senate confirmed Lisa 
Monaco as Deputy Attorney General. 
She will oversee the Drug Enforcement 
Administration. 
President 
Biden’s 
nominee 
to 
head 
the 
DEA, 
Anne 
Milgram, is still to be considered by 
the Senate, so this request now for a 
temporary extension seems reasonable. 
Let me add, though, at the same time 
as we grapple with the opioid epidemic, 
we are also in the midst of a national 
reckoning about racism and massive 
incarceration in America. We hold 
more prisoners, by far, than any coun-
try in the world. This is largely due to 
our failed War on Drugs, which has dis-
proportionately 
targeted 
people 
of 
color. While the majority of illegal 
drug users and drug dealers in our 
country is White, the vast majority of

people incarcerated for drug offenses is 
African American or Latino. That is a 
fact. 
More than three decades ago—and I 
remember this well as I served in the 
House at the time—Congress responded 
to the dramatic rise in the use of crack 
cocaine by dramatically increasing 
sentences for nonviolent drug offend-
ers; for example, with a sentencing 
guideline for crack cocaine as com-
pared to powder cocaine of 100 to 1. 
Well, that was it. We were going to get 
tough. We were going to send a mes-
sage. It didn’t work. The overall use of 
illegal drugs actually increased after 
we increased these penalties between 
1990 and 2014, and the availability of 
drugs like heroin and methamphet-
amine, instead of going down, in-
creased. 
Senator CORY BOOKER is the chair of 
the Criminal Justice and Counterter-
rorism Subcommittee of the Senate 
Judiciary. He has brought these con-
cerns to the floor of the Senate time 
and again. I was proud to join him as 
well as Senator GRASSLEY and Senator 
LEE. We authored the FIRST STEP Act 
to begin reforming our criminal justice 
system from the previous effort with 
our War on Drugs. 
Senator BOOKER has raised serious 
concerns about extending the DEA’s 
order when it comes to these fentanyl 
analogs. For example, he notes the sig-
nificant racial disparity in fentanyl 
analog prosecutions. People of color 
comprise 68 percent of those being sen-
tenced. He also notes that addiction is, 
in fact, a public health crisis and that 
we cannot prosecute ourselves out of 
the opioid epidemic, a lesson we should 
have learned with the War on Drugs. 
So there is an important debate to be 
had about how to effectively combat 
the abuse of fentanyl, but we cannot 
resolve it today on the floor of the Sen-
ate. The DEA’s authority is scheduled 
to expire next week, and we will be 
gone. Last week, the House passed a 
bill extending the scheduling order 
until October 22. Senator BOOKER has 
agreed not to object to the House bill 
so that the Senate will have an oppor-
tunity to debate the future of this DEA 
authority and consider other impor-
tant reforms to our criminal justice 
system. 
Mr. President, at this point, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 2630, which was received 
from the House and is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 2630) to amend the Temporary 
Reauthorization and Study of the Emer-
gency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act 
to extend until October 2021, a temporary 
order for fentanyl-related substances. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill was ordered to a third read-
ing and was read the third time. 
Mr. DURBIN. I know of no further de-
bate on the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
If not, the bill having been read the 
third time, the question is, Shall the 
bill pass? 
The bill (H.R. 2630) was passed. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

DRINKING 
WATER 
AND 
WASTE-
WATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
ACT 
OF 2021—Continued 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak in strong support of the 
Drinking Water and Wastewater Infra-
structure Act of 2021. I want to thank 
Environment and Public Works Rank-
ing Member CAPITO, full committee 
Chairman 
CARPER, 
Chairman 
DUCKWORTH, and their staffs for their 
hard work and cooperation on this bill. 
While many issues divide this Senate, 
clean water is not one of them. As 
ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Fisheries, 
Water, 
and 
Wildlife 
Subcommittee 
under which drinking water and waste-
water jurisdiction lies, I am proud to 
see the work our committee has done 
to bring this bill to the floor today, 
and I especially want to thank Senator 
DUCKWORTH for all of her efforts to 
serve our communities by shepherding 
this bill through the Senate. 
On May 17th, our committee and sub-
committee held a hearing to examine 
the challenges facing drinking water 
and 
wastewater 
infrastructure 
throughout the Nation. We heard from 
witnesses that many obstacles remain 
in 
America’s 
water 
quality. 
High 
among those obstacles is the lagging 
funding related to an aging infrastruc-
ture. The primary mechanism for fi-
nancing water infrastructure is from 
State and local sources, including the 
collection of user fees, but funding has 
not kept pace with the growing need to 
address an aging system. Only 20 per-
cent of very large utilities and 10 per-
cent of small utilities report that they 
will be able to provide full-cost service 
in 5 years. I am proud to be a part of 
the team that has come together to 
find a solution to these problems. 
While 
working 
on 
this 
issue, 
I 
learned something that might surprise 
a lot of Americans: The majority of our 
Nation’s drinking water and waste-
water utilities are small. Over 90 per-
cent of the country’s roughly 50,000 
community water systems serve popu-
lations fewer than 10,000 people. Rough-
ly 80 percent of America’s 17,000 waste-
water utilities serve populations fewer 
than 10,000 people. Rural and small 
communities like many found in my 
State of Wyoming have greater dif-
ficulty affording public wastewater 
service due to low population density 
and lack of economies of scale. Rural 
communities also have lower median 
household incomes and often have 
higher 
rates 
of 
poverty, 
only 
compounding the challenge. The man-
dates and requirements given under the 
Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking 
Water Act can be burdensome on these 
small and rural communities. This bill 
reauthorizes a number of programs 
that will provide technical assistance, 
funding, research, and expertise for 
these small communities. The Circuit 
Rider Program, for example, has long 
been among our Nation’s most success-
ful public-private partnerships. The 
Wyoming Association of Rural Water 
Systems and organizations like it 
across the country are doing yeomen’s 
work in delivering for our rural com-
munities. 
The Drinking Water and Wastewater 
Infrastructure Act unanimously passed 
our committee by a vote of 21 to 0. 
Similar legislation worked on by then- 
Chairman 
BARRASSO
and 
Ranking 
Member CARPER likewise passed with-
out any opposition last Congress. 
Mr. President, I have the unique 
privilege of being the only Senator to 
sit on all three committees of jurisdic-
tion over transportation and infra-
structure. All three committees are 
hard at work considering the recent in-
frastructure plan put forward by Presi-
dent Biden. Let me give a brief history 
of the bipartisan nature of this topic. 
In 2019, the EPW Committee under 
my fellow Senator from Wyoming JOHN 
BARRASSO, passed a 5-year highway 
funding bill unanimously out of com-
mittee. In 2018, President Trump signed 
the bipartisan America’s Water Infra-
structure Act into law. In 2016, Presi-
dent Obama signed the bipartisan 
Water Infrastructure Improvements for 
the Nation Act into law. In 2015 we had 
two 
bipartisan 
transportation 
bills 
pass into law, and in 2014 we had an-
other bipartisan water resources bill 
become law. 
President Biden mentioned last night 
that infrastructure is historically a bi-
partisan issue. He applauded my Re-
publican colleagues for putting forward 
a good infrastructure plan of our own 
just last week. Our Republican bill is 
based on ideas that have garnered bi-
partisan support in the past, which 
makes it a perfect foundation upon 
which to build an infrastructure plan 
that could pass into law. I urge Presi-
dent Biden and my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to remember this 
as we move to an infrastructure bill. 
I am proud of the work that my col-
leagues and I did on today’s Drinking 
Water and Wastewater Infrastructure 
Act. I would like to thank my col-
leagues on the EPW Committee for 
their work, and I urge all Senators to 
support it. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in support of the Drinking 
Water and Wastewater Infrastructure

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2325 
April 29, 2021 
Act, S. 914, introduced by my colleague 
Senator DUCKWORTH. This bill would 
provide much needed funding for drink-
ing water and wastewater cleanup 
across the country, addressing climate 
change and assisting underserved com-
munities. 
Millions of Americans do not have 
access to clean water. In California 
alone, it is estimated that nearly 1 mil-
lion Californians do not have access to 
clean water from their tap. California 
faces unique water challenges, and in 
the face of climate change, drought 
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
contamination, and population growth, 
my State’s aging water infrastructure, 
like many others, is in need of support. 
The Drinking Water and Wastewater 
Infrastructure Act authorizes more 
than $35 billion for updating and re-
pairing aging infrastructure, and also 
assisting historically underserved and 
marginalized communities. 
Communities of color and low-in-
come communities are more likely to 
lack the infrastructure to provide safe 
drinking water to households and pre-
vent water contamination. For exam-
ple, the farming communities of the 
San Joaquin Valley face a frequent 
danger of drought that threatens to dry 
up their groundwater supply. 
These predominantly Latino commu-
nities also face the threat of growing 
nitrate levels in their ground water 
supplies, forcing families to forego 
using tap water for drinking, cooking, 
and even showering. 
This bill would fix these disparities 
by funding investments and advance-
ments in infrastructure to ensure that 
families have access to clean water, no 
matter where they live. 
I am pleased that my amendment to 
Section 203 was included in the sub-
stitute bill. Section 203 of the base bill 
creates a new EPA grant program for 
water recycling and other sustainable 
water supplies that will complement 
the existing Bureau of Reclamation 
water recycling program. 
In the base bill, section 203 prohibits 
water recycling projects that have re-
ceived any Bureau of Reclamation 
funding from receiving EPA funding. I 
think it is reasonable to prohibit water 
districts that have received Bureau of 
Reclamation 
construction 
funding 
from also receiving construction fund-
ing from EPA. 
But the base bill would also prohibit 
water districts from applying for EPA 
grants if they received even prelimi-
nary Reclamation funding years ago 
for feasibility studies, planning, or de-
sign. 
The new EPA program is needed pre-
cisely because there is a backlog of $800 
million to $1 billion for water recycling 
projects under the Bureau of Reclama-
tion’s program. 
I don’t believe it makes sense to pro-
hibit water districts from accessing 
available EPA funding to build needed 
water recycling projects just because 
they got a little Reclamation study 
funding years ago. 
My 
amendment, 
which 
Senators 
PADILLA and KELLY cosponsored, would 
ensure that water recycling projects 
that received Bureau of Reclamation 
funding for studies would still be eligi-
ble to apply for EPA funding. 
I thank the bill managers for accept-
ing this amendment into the substitute 
bill. 
I am also pleased to vote for Senator 
SHAHEEN’s bill and thank the Senator 
for her efforts to improve our nation’s 
water infrastructure. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, this 
week on the Senate floor, my col-
leagues and I have explained how the 
Drinking Water and Wastewater Infra-
structure Act of 2021 would make sig-
nificant improvements to our country’s 
water infrastructure. 
After a bipartisan, regular order leg-
islative and amendment process, we 
move to final consideration. 
This legislation makes meaningful 
progress on our drinking water and 
wastewater challenges that will benefit 
the States represented by every single 
one of us. 
It invests heavily in the State revolv-
ing loan funds to give our States that 
flexibility they need in their funding. 
It creates a new grant program spe-
cifically for small and disadvantaged 
communities to upgrade their systems, 
fix leaky pipes, and prevent water loss. 
It helps connect low-income house-
holds to public water systems or helps 
them to get new and better septic 
tanks. 
It 
supports 
water 
infrastructure 
projects on Indian reservation lands 
and in Alaskan Native villages. 
It provides assistance to remove and 
replace lead pipes, as well as lead test-
ing in schools and childcare centers. 
It encourages the next generation to 
be a part of that water infrastructure 
workforce that is so critical. 
All of the investments represent the 
EPW’s shared goals of improving public 
health and fostering economic growth 
in all of our communities. 
These are just a few of the provisions 
which I wanted to highlight and which 
are informed by particular challenges 
facing our water systems in the State 
of West Virginia, but based on the feed-
back from all of our colleagues in both 
parties and the groundswell of support 
we have seen from various water advo-
cacy groups, it is clear that these pro-
visions will have broad applicability to 
help communities all across the United 
States. It is why we have such a di-
verse and growing coalition of more 
than 70 supporters, from water systems 
to local governments, to industry, to 
labor, to environmental organizations. 
Before I wrap up, I would like to 
thank my colleague and chairman of 
our committee and West Virginia-born 
Chairman TOM CARPER. 
This legislation represents, I think, a 
fantastic first effort for our ongoing 
work together to address the major 
concerns of the American people when 
it comes to infrastructure and the en-
vironment, and in a thoughtful and fis-
cally responsible fashion. 
His staff has been engaged and candid 
with mine throughout this entire proc-
ess. So, in particular, I would like to 
thank John Kane, the lead for Chair-
man CARPER’s water team, and his col-
league Annie D’Amato, as well as Tyler 
Hoffman-Reardon 
and 
Mackie 
McIntosh, 
who 
provided 
support 
throughout 
these 
negotiations. 
So 
thank you. Chairman CARPER’s team is 
led by staff director Mary Frances 
Repko, who brought her wealth of ex-
perience to bear on this process as well. 
I would certainly like to take time to 
highlight the members of my team, 
who worked long hours, nights and 
weekends, to deliver this legislation— 
Jess Kramer, EPW Republican water 
counsel, and Travis Cone, who is here 
with me today, my Republican deputy 
staff director and lead for our environ-
mental team. They led the negotia-
tions on our side and brought us to 
where we are today. 
They had strong assistance from our 
staff director, Adam Tomlinson, as well 
as chief counsel Elizabeth Horner, as 
well as Max Hyman, one of our policy 
staff who contributed to the language 
we see today in this bill. 
I would like to also thank and con-
gratulate Fisheries, Water, and Wild-
life 
Subcommittee 
Chair 
TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH and Ranking Member CYN-
THIA LUMMIS and their staffs for their 
hard work on this bill. They are two of 
my colleagues from my House days, 
and I am so glad that all of us are 
working together again on the same 
committee, no less, here in the U.S. 
Senate. 
I also appreciate Transportation and 
Infrastructure 
Subcommittee 
Chair 
BEN CARDIN, whom I have worked with 
on a lot of these issues previously, and 
also my good friend Ranking Member 
KEVIN CRAMER for providing a lot of 
input into this legislation. 
This has absolutely been a team ef-
fort. It is what we are here for, to work 
together. I look forward to our team 
racking up a lot more wins in infra-
structure and beyond over the course 
of the 117th Congress. 
In closing, I just want to reiterate 
again that passing this bipartisan bill 
in a bipartisan way is also very impor-
tant. We know it is more than sym-
bolic, but there is symbolism, I think, 
here because it shows the American 
people what we hear all the time when 
we go home: that their elected officials 
in Congress can work together and col-
laboratively on issues such as infra-
structure. The bill represents the solid 
work that comes out of good-faith ne-
gotiations. 
Chairman CARPER and I worked to-
gether and never took our eye off of 
the mutual goal—a bipartisan bill that 
can pass both Chambers and be signed 
into law. We are here today with that 
bill. I am proud to be Chairman CAR-
PER’s partner, and I appreciate his 
leadership.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2326 
April 29, 2021 
I hope that as we move forward with 
other infrastructure packages, we re-
member this moment. We know the 
next couple of weeks and months are 
going to be tough, but we can do tough 
things to deliver for the American peo-
ple. That is what we were sent here to 
do. 
So, again, I urge my colleagues to 
vote yes on this legislation, and I hope 
we continue in this spirit. 
I yield the floor, or I yield to my 
partner, Chairman CARPER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I don’t 
want to trivialize this important mo-
ment, but I am tempted to say: I am 
TOM CARPER, and I approve this mes-
sage. But I won’t say that, but I cer-
tainly do approve this message. 
So pretty remarkable. We have three 
Members of our body who were born in 
West Virginia, and one is the daughter 
of a former Governor of our State and 
maybe the mother of a future Governor 
of our State. We will have to wait and 
see. 
We have another former Governor of 
West Virginia who serves here with us 
and whose wife Gayle actually was in 
the same high school graduating class 
with my first cousin Dan Patton. It is 
really kind of incestuous. But people 
ask why we get along so well, and I am 
reminded of the words of Joe Biden. He 
and I rode the train together a lot of 
years to Delaware and back when I 
joined him in the Senate and in the 
House before that. Joe likes to say— 
the President likes to say that all poli-
tics is personal. He says that all diplo-
macy is personal as well. And I think 
you see a little bit of that at work 
here, and it is just a good reminder for 
all of us. 
Before we vote here in a couple min-
utes, I just want to express once again 
my support for the legislation before 
us, the Drinking Water and Wastewater 
Infrastructure Act of 2021. 
I am a firm believer that actions do 
speak louder than words, so before we 
move to a vote, let me close by salut-
ing the unanimous action taken by the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works on this bill. 
Every member of the committee, all 
of us, every one of us, had a hand in 
crafting the legislation with the help of 
our staff—half of us Democrats, half of 
us Republicans. 
First of all, the committee members 
worked together to formulate legisla-
tion that would reauthorize critical fi-
nancing 
mechanisms 
for 
drinking 
water and wastewater infrastructure 
across our country. 
In bipartisan negotiations, we ad-
dressed the fundamental needs of the 
communities that have been left be-
hind by our past efforts to address 
clean water, and we have—or at least 
we sought to try to ensure with this 
bill that rural and disadvantaged and 
Tribal communities will have the need-
ed resources they need to access the 
same safe water that the rest of us 
really take for granted most of the 
time. 
After all those efforts involving 
members on both sides of our com-
mittee dais and many of our colleagues 
throughout this body, we reported this 
much needed legislation to the full 
Senate by unanimous vote, 20 to 0. 
That is right, 20 to 0. The bill we hope 
to take up today passed out of our 
committee unanimously. In fact, the 
Republicans like this bipartisan bill so 
much that they included it in their in-
frastructure proposal, and President 
Biden supports this legislation as a 
good first step forward. He reminded us 
of that last night in his address. 
We just don’t see this kind of biparti-
sanship often enough, and I think—I 
talked earlier about how we are lead-
ers. We have a responsibility to lead by 
example. That is what I was trained to 
do in the Navy and a lot of us as well— 
lead by example. We are trying to do 
that here today. 
That remarkable consensus is why 
this bill is so worthy of our support. 
The benefit that it provides will reach 
all corners of our Nation. This legisla-
tion will be a boon not just to our 
towns and not just to our cities but 
also to our rural communities. It will 
help ensure the healthy environment 
necessary for our collective happiness, 
vitality, and long-term success, no 
matter where we live. You know what 
it says in the Declaration of Independ-
ence. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. This is part of that. Without 
water, we just don’t have any of those 
things. 
Not only does the Drinking Water 
and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 
2021 provide the resources we need to 
build, the resources we need to up-
grade, the resources we need to expand 
critical infrastructure, but it also en-
sures that we make a substantial in-
vestment in projects that will with-
stand the increasingly harsh weather 
events—be they storms, be they floods, 
freezing 
cold 
snaps, 
droughts—that 
have plagued places like Texas and 
Mississippi 
in 
recent 
weeks 
and 
months. 
As all my colleagues in this body are 
aware, the ravages of changing climate 
in the form of devastating weather 
could hit any of our communities at 
any time and in many cases already 
have. 
There is a good reason why groups 
like the U.S. Conference of Mayors on 
the one hand, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce on the other hand, and the 
National Wildlife Federation support 
this legislation. 
I mentioned earlier on the floor the 
American Society of Civil Engineers, 
which gave our water systems a D—I 
think a D-minus average grade on the 
2021 report card on the state of our Na-
tion’s infrastructure. This is what they 
say about this bill after giving us I 
think a D-minus average grade on our 
Nation’s infrastructure. Here is what 
they said about this legislation. Sen-
ator CAPITO, here is what they said: 
. . . critical if we are to improve our nation’s 
aging water systems and ensure that they 
continue to provide and protect public 
health, welfare, and safety. 
There is plenty in it to inspire the 
Rural Community Assistance Partner-
ship to say the organization is ‘‘proud 
to support this bill because Americans 
deserve clean, safe, reliable, and afford-
able drinking water, regardless of their 
community’s size or zip code.’’ Col-
leagues, I couldn’t agree more. 
This measure reauthorizes and in-
creases funding for the bedrock Federal 
water and wastewater infrastructure fi-
nancing problems—the drinking water 
and clean water State revolving funds. 
In the case of the Clean Water Fund, 
this is the first reauthorization of the 
Clean Water Fund in 35 years—35 years. 
Local government leaders, policy ex-
perts, and advocates from all parts of 
our country and all political stripes 
also support our bill because it would 
invest $500 billion to ensure water in-
frastructure systems are more resilient 
in the face of extreme weather events. 
These leaders are urging us to pass 
this legislation because it expands the 
government’s role in researching and 
developing the water technologies of 
tomorrow, opening the door to eco-
nomic opportunity and jobs across this 
country. 
Finally, millions of Americans—too 
many Americans, millions of them— 
cannot trust the water when they turn 
on their taps. Most of us turned on our 
tap water this morning either at our 
homes or our bathrooms or wherever 
and maybe in our offices and we drank 
the water and we didn’t think anything 
of it. We knew it was fine and it was 
safe. Too many people in this coun-
try—millions of them, in fact—don’t 
have that benefit. 
I think we have a moral responsi-
bility to help make sure that everyone 
in our Nation—it doesn’t matter what 
their ZIP Code is. It doesn’t matter 
their race. It doesn’t matter what their 
income is. We have a moral obligation 
to make sure they have access to clean, 
safe water. 
The Golden Rule—treat other people 
the way we want to be treated—very 
much is part of this and guides, I 
think, all of us. 
With this legislation, we can move 
forward on that effort and, in doing so, 
create jobs, foster innovation, and pro-
tect our public health all at once. 
I am proud of our bill. I am proud of 
all the work that has gone into it and 
proud of the bipartisan process to 
produce it with our colleagues that led 
us here. I hope our colleagues agree 
that it is worthy of the same bipar-
tisan support on the Senate floor as it 
received in committee. 
Nothing is perfect. What do they say 
in the Constitution? What did the 
Framers say? In order to form a more 
perfect Union? Well, I have never been 
part of writing or co-writing a perfect 
bill. This was not perfect, and there are 
obviously some changes that—we can 
make it better—some changes that we

April 29, 2021 
will discuss with our colleagues on the 
committee, off the committee, and 
with our friends in the House and the 
administration. But this is a good 
start. This is a very good start. And we 
look forward to the next step in this 
process, and I would ask everyone to 
please join us in voting yes. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. First, Mr. President, 
it was good when I walked in—it felt 
really good when I walked in a few 
hours ago as we were voting, and I saw 
Mr. 
CARPER, 
Senator 
CARPER, 
the 
chairman of the EPW Committee, sit-
ting here and Senator CAPITO, the 
ranking member, sitting there, work-
ing together to make sure that this bill 
passed and working together to defeat 
some amendments that might have 
hurt the whole bill’s chance of passing. 
That is how it used to be around here 
all the time, and it is good to see it. 
And I thank both the chair and the 
ranking member for doing that as well 
as the whole Senate as well, including 
Leader MCCONNELL. We are trying to 
work in a bipartisan way whenever we 
can, and this bill is a classic example. 
First, its importance, of course, is 
paramount—and I will get to that in a 
minute—but, second, the fact that we 
can come together on an important bill 
that is a part of the Build Back Better 
plan is something that I think Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle can be 
very 
happy 
about, 
and 
Americans 
should be happy about as well. 
It doesn’t mean that we will be able 
to do the whole thing bipartisan, but 
we will do as much as we can—as much 
as we can. 
And this bill is an important one. 
Clean water is vital to the American 
people and to their health, and for too 
long we have tolerated lead in the 
water of too many. When lead gets into 
the water of young people, it can cer-
tainly cause health problems in later 
years. All too often, it occurs in poorer 
communities 
and 
communities 
of 
color. 
This bill, in a bipartisan way, says 
we are going to come together and get 
the lead out—get the lead out of our 
pipes, get the lead out of our faucets, 
get the lead out of our water. That is 
an important part of this bill. 
And the second part of the bill is, you 
know, water is very, very important to 
bringing businesses. Upstate New York, 
we are trying to attract businesses. 
One of the first things a business will 
ask is: Do you have some land avail-
able that has water and sewer? When 
you can say yes, you have a much bet-
ter chance of attracting businesses to 
those communities that definitely need 
new jobs. 
And, finally, of course, we all depend 
on water in our daily lives, and many 
of the systems are old. They are a cen-
tury old. Many of our local govern-
ments no longer have the dollars to do 
this on their own. So having a bill that 
is robust, that helps them, is very, very 
important. 
I would finally note that the bill that 
we are voting on today is very much— 
is very similar to the proposal made by 
some of the Republican leaders when 
they put together a proposal to Presi-
dent Biden. 
So, again, closing on the note I 
opened with, the happy bipartisanship 
that marks this bill is a very good 
thing, and I hope it can continue. 
I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous 
consent that the rollcall vote begin 
now. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON S. 914, AS AMENDED 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill, as amended, 
pass? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from Washington (Ms. CANT-
WELL), the Senator from Maryland (Mr. 
CARDIN), and the Senator from Mary-
land (Mr. VAN HOLLEN) are necessarily 
absent. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from North Dakota (Mr. CRAMER), the 
Senator from Kansas (Mr. MORAN), the

Then, 15. I had no idea where she was, 
and, at the time, barely even knew who 
she was. All I knew was that on her 
first day, as not just a volunteer but a 
full-time employee, our latest hire was 
ridiculously late to pick me up to drive 
me to the next campaign stop. Not a 
great look for her first task on the job. 
Twenty minutes passed. Then, 25. 
Then, 30. She still wasn’t there. 
Her name was Kaitlin ‘‘Something,’’ 
I remembered. Well, whenever Kaitlin 
‘‘Something’’ deigned to show up—if 
Kaitlin ‘‘Something’’ deigned to show 
up at all—she would get a lesson in 
working for a former military officer 
who 
believed 
in 
the 
sanctity 
of 
clocking in at 0855 hours if your com-
manding officer told you to report at 
0900 hours. 
Thirty-five minutes went by. Then, 
40. 
It was only after 45 minutes had 
passed that I saw her car coming 
around the bend. And while I could not 
have noted at the time, Kaitlin ‘‘Some-
thing’’ was about to become one of the 
most important people in my life. But 
on that day, she made me miss an 
event because we were too late. 
In the 15 years since that day that 
she showed up so incredibly late, 
Kaitlin Fahey has gone from being an 
intern to being in charge of interns, to, 
well, being in charge of me as my 
scheduler and then as my chief of staff. 
She has become a trusted political 
adviser, a confidant, a close friend, and 
an honorary member of my family— 
someone I knew I could turn to for a 
gut check and for the most brutally 
honest advice, the person who can both 
calm me down and rev me up and who 
can switch between the two on a dime. 
From greasy fast food stops along 
campaign routes to the hallowed halls 
of the Capitol Building that I am 
speaking in today, Kaitlin has never 
left my corner. She has always pushed 
for what was good and right, for what 
was best not just for me but for the 
people I represented—never, ever ac-
cepting the word ‘‘no’’ when a ‘‘yes’’ 
might be better to help even one fam-
ily in one far-flung town of our home 
State of Illinois. 
Day after day, year after year, in role 
after role, she worked tirelessly, not on 
my behalf but on behalf of every Illi-
noisan, every American, proving along 
the way that you don’t need to wear a 
nation’s uniform to serve our country; 
that you can serve America without 
ever going to basic training or picking 
up a rifle; that you can serve America, 
and change her forever and for the bet-
ter, simply by caring deeply and work-
ing tirelessly to make tomorrow a lit-
tle bit better, a little fairer than today. 
There are a million stories I could 
tell about the work that Kaitlin has 
done and all that she has accomplished, 
but I will hold myself to just one: when 
she helped change Senate rules to 
allow babies onto the floor for votes so 
that new parents could fulfill their du-
ties to both their children and the Con-
stitution, showing moms and dads in 
every pocket of this country that they 
shouldn’t need to choose between hav-
ing jobs and having kids. 
You can see why I call her ‘‘The 
Hammer’’ and why she is one of the 
only people in the world who scares the 
living daylights out of me, but in the 
best way possible. And you can also see 
why I have been so lucky to have her in 
my corner all these years, to have her 
as a partner in office pranks, and to 
have her as a sister, who I could count 
on to simply sit in silence on the other 
end of the phone and cry with me after 
my miscarriage. 
This month was Kaitlin’s last as my 
chief of staff. So, today, I just want to 
say thank you to her. 
Thank you to Kaitlin’s wonderful 
family 
also—Scott, 
Ronan, 
and 
Brenna—for lending us your wife and 
your mom. 
And thank you, Kaitlin, for every 
moment of the last 15 years. Thank 
you for imparting your humor and for 
humoring me, for showing that warmth 
and strength can be one in the same, 
for not quitting when I tried to get you 
to wear a wedding dress made out of 
camouflage material, or when I got the 
office to take part in ‘‘Talk like a Pi-
rate Day’’ and do every memo in ‘‘Pi-
rate.’’ Thank you for being the kind of 
person who would jump out of a car 
and run out into the middle of the 
street to help save a lost dog—which 
she actually just did this past election 
day. 
Thank you for keeping me in line and 
for building our team from the ground 
up, running our office—first in the 
House and then in the Senate—with 
grace, 
precision, 
and 
brilliance; 
prioritizing empathy and compassion, 
common sense, and common decency; 
wearing a million hats all at once yet 
always making sure our staff felt val-
ued, heard, and ever able to serve the 
people of Illinois. Thank you for being 
my ‘‘Hammer.’’ 
I don’t thank you for not letting me 
get a Margarita machine for the office, 
however. But I also thank you for 
being my friend, for showing up to 
drive me in your car that day, albeit 45 
minutes late. You were worth waiting 
for every one of those minutes. I love 
you. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
have had the privilege to represent the 
great State of Oklahoma and the peo-
ple of Oklahoma, to be able to sit in 
multiple Presidential addresses in the 
House of Representatives Chamber. 
At that joint address that happened 
last night, I didn’t have the privilege 
to actually get a chance to sit in on. 
As, clearly, anyone who watched the 
speech saw that there were 200 people 
in a room designed for 1,600 people, 
with the spacing and all of the things 
that were happening there. In some 
ways it seemed normal, and some ways 
it seemed ridiculous with the room of 
200 vaccinated people all spaced out. 
But that is a different story for a dif-
ferent moment. 
For that speech last night, as I lis-
tened, I thought about the other 
speeches that I have listened to as well. 
Many of these speeches are similar. 
The President comes and casts a vi-
sion. Says these are things that they 
want to be able to do, talk through dif-
ferent programs, talk through different 
tax issues, talk through where we are 
as a country, cast a vision. I get all of 
those things. 
Last night, and every night, when 
one of those speeches occurs, there is 
usually something unique or different 
about the speech. It is a little different 
direction for where they want to go. 
Not all those programs will get imple-
mented. I had people already con-
tacting my office, panicked in some 
ways, saying: Are all those things 
going to be done? And I can smile at 
them and say: No, all those things 
won’t be done, because it never is. It is 
a vision that is cast by the President 
that they have to convince the Amer-
ican people and Congress to be able to 
engage with as well. 
But last night was epic in the sense 
of spending. I was even surprised at the 
amount that we are talking about at 
this point, and it seems to be just so 
flippant and normal at this point. 
When you do the math of what just 
happened with the American Rescue 
Plan, that was just under $2 trillion of 
spending. Last night, one of the pro-
posals was also about $2 trillion, and 
another one was about $2.5 trillion. So 
take those together—just over $6 tril-
lion in proposed and spent government 
debt just in those three recommended. 
What people aren’t adding to this is 
that starting in June, in July, it is ap-
propriations time. Our best under-
standing—we 
haven’t 
received 
the 
budget from the White House yet—is 
that proposal will be about $4.5 trillion. 
So adding together what happened in 
the first 100 days and what is about to 
happen in the next 100 days that we al-
ready see coming, is a proposal to 
spend, this year, $11 trillion—$11 tril-
lion. That far exceeds what was even 
spent during the pandemic time period, 
when we all determined that this is a 
rainy day that we definitely need to be 
able to help stabilize our economy—$11 
trillion. 
The size of government, the number 
of times that I heard, ‘‘If there is a 
problem, government here in Wash-
ington, DC, can solve it’’—it was epic. 
Now, initially, at the beginning of 
the speech, there was a lot of talk 
about COVID, as well there should be. 
Our Nation is coming through this. But 
I was surprised how little conversation 
there was about the vaccines and the 
process, Operation Warp Speed, and the 
partnership between government and 
private industry that was done last 
year to be able to bring all these vac-
cines to place.

S2342 
April 29, 2021 
You see, all the vaccines were devel-
oped and ordered last year. All the nee-
dles and the alcohol wipes and the ma-
terials—the PPP that would be need-
ed—were all ordered last year. This 
year was just a matter of getting shots 
in arms, which I am incredibly grateful 
we have had so many Americans that 
have stepped up and driven up, come 
and put their arm out there and said I 
want to be part of this solution for get-
ting rid of COVID in our country. 
Everyone knew that as we got shots 
in arms, we would see the numbers 
come down—at least we hoped. And we 
did. The numbers are coming down, and 
the economy is coming back up. That 
is the other thing that everyone pre-
dicted, as well—that as soon as some of 
the shutdowns happened, we would 
begin to see the economy begin to rise 
again, and, thankfully, we are. 
It was interesting to be able to hear 
the President last night take credit for 
all that, which I assume every Presi-
dent sitting in that spot would. But I 
am grateful to President Trump and 
the leadership that happened in HHS 
and the work of career folks and the 
folks who are in science and private in-
dustry and pharmaceuticals and what 
they have done over the last year be-
cause it is remarkable what we actu-
ally have walked through and what we 
have seen. 
What was not mentioned last night 
when talking about the economy is un-
employment insurance. It is something 
I brought to this body before. When I 
traveled around my State the week be-
fore Easter and the week after Easter 
when we were not voting those 2 
weeks—as I traveled around, every em-
ployer I talked to said the same thing: 
We are hiring, but we don’t have people 
applying, or people who are applying 
are coming in and just applying and 
filling out a form, and when they offer 
them the job, they are saying: I don’t 
want the job. I just need to be able to 
bring the completed form back to the 
unemployment office so I can continue 
to get my check. 
I talked to employees who were frus-
trated because the person who used to 
work next to them is not showing up 
for work anymore because they are 
home getting unemployment benefits 
because the unemployment benefits in 
my State right now far exceed what 
the normal wage is. People aren’t 
showing up. That is a problem in our 
economy. 
My fear is that is a problem that is 
going to continue all the way until 
September because the unemployment 
benefits that were extended were ex-
tended all the way through the first 
week of September. Even though we 
pushed back and said this is a bad idea, 
the Democratic colleagues and the 
President said: No, let’s keep moving 
forward. 
There are lots of parts of the Green 
New Deal that were presented last 
night, but they didn’t use the term 
‘‘Green New Deal.’’ It was bits and 
pieces of elements of the Green New 
Deal separated in different sets of the 
ideas. The term ‘‘Green New Deal’’ has 
become very, very unpopular with folks 
as they find out what it is. Taking 
pieces of the Green New Deal, sepa-
rating them in different spots, and try-
ing to pass them doesn’t change any-
thing either. 
I was surprised how little the Presi-
dent really talked about what is going 
on in the crisis at the border. He did 
mention it, and I was pleased to see 
that. Many people in my State really 
see that as a very serious issue that 
needs to be resolved. Our open borders 
right now and the literally hundreds of 
thousands of people who have crossed 
our border illegally just this calendar 
year, just in the last 100 days, is record 
levels. 
I talked to the Border Patrol folks, 
and they talked about how in March 
alone, they had 172,000 encounters. It is 
a record number. But now in April, 
they are hitting or exceeding that 
record, just in April, again because the 
numbers continue to skyrocket to 
numbers we have not seen. The number 
of unaccompanied minors is at a 20- 
year high. We have not seen these num-
bers in decades. 
It is a significant issue for us as a 
country. It is one that started on Janu-
ary 20 with the change in policy and 
issues. 
We have more than 5,000 individuals 
who have been picked up by Border Pa-
trol just this year who have a criminal 
record in the United States. 
We have 15,000 individuals whom Bor-
der Patrol has just released into the 
country with no notice to appear at all, 
just a statement as they come through. 
The line was so long that Border Patrol 
leadership was telling them, from 
Washington, DC, that if the line gets 
too long, just release people into the 
country and tell them to check in with 
immigration folks in whatever part of 
the country they go to. Just check in. 
Literally, if they are coming across the 
border and the line is too long, just let 
them go and tell them to check them-
selves in when they get to wherever 
they are going in the country—15,000 
people like that just this year. 
We have 150,000 people whom Border 
Patrol has reported that they saw 
crossing the border, but they literally 
didn’t have the manpower to even get 
to them, what they call ‘‘got aways’’— 
150,000 this year who won’t show up in 
anyone’s numbers of people entering 
the country illegally. 
These numbers are truly epic num-
bers. 
Last night, the President’s proposal 
was to allow us to do more in Central 
America and eventually this will get 
better. I would tell you from being 
down at the border three times just 
this year and interacting with folks, I 
would encourage anyone from the ad-
ministration to go to the border and 
actually see what is going on and actu-
ally talk to law enforcement there. 
From being down in that area, their 
concern is that this is a very long-term 
issue 
because 
the 
administration 
doesn’t seem to see it as a crisis or 
something that has to be fixed imme-
diately; it can be fixed eventually, with 
hundreds of thousands of people com-
ing across the border now every month. 
In the last official report from Cus-
toms and Border Protection and Border 
Patrol, there were over 100 different 
countries represented by the individ-
uals crossing the border just this 
year—over 100 countries. It is not just 
folks from Central America. Literally, 
people from all over the world are pay-
ing the cartels the money it takes to 
get through Mexico and traveling into 
our country and checking in or skip-
ping across the border, and they dis-
appear into our economy. I see that as 
an issue. I wish the administration 
would see that as an issue. 
A conversation that came up last 
night was about voting. It is an impor-
tant conversation for us. We are a rep-
resentative republic. Voting is ex-
tremely important to us as a nation; 
that every vote counts and that every 
vote has the integrity that it needs. 
But with S. 1 and on the House side, 
what they call H.R. 1, I am stunned at 
the contents of that bill. 
When President Biden said: Just pass 
that bill and put it on my desk, I 
thought, there is absolutely no way I 
would pass a bill like that; nor would 
the people at home even want me to 
pass a bill like that. 
That is a bill that is intentionally de-
signed to make voting easy and cheat-
ing easy. We want to make voting easy 
and cheating hard. That is the way we 
have done elections for a very long 
time. Why would we want to shift from 
that? I am all for making voting as 
easy as we can. My State has early vot-
ing. It has mail-in voting and all the 
characteristics you want to have to 
protect the integrity of the vote so 
when it is over, everyone can look at it 
and say: My person won or lost, but I 
trust the integrity of the vote. It has 
all those elements. 
We worked very hard to make sure 
every community in every area has ac-
cess to voting and doesn’t have long 
lines and make sure we get to mail out 
ballots and all those things to be able 
to not only give the opportunity for 
people to vote but to protect the integ-
rity of the vote. 
S. 1 and H.R. 1 does things like same- 
day registration but also removes voter 
ID. You partner those two together, 
and that is a recipe for double-voting 
and fraud. You can’t have those two to-
gether. 
It mandates a third-party collection 
of ballots that could be done in any 
State. Individual political groups could 
literally go door-to-door and say: Have 
you voted yet? If you haven’t, come 
out on the porch right now. I will stand 
with you, and we can vote together, 
and then I will turn your ballot in for 
you. 
That violates everything we have 
done in voting about secret ballots and 
about the integrity of the ballot, and

only the folks in the post office would 
handle it or the folks in the polling 
place would handle it. Now, this is a 
third party whom no one has any con-
nection to nor accountability to who 
can randomly grab ballots and collect 
them. How do we not think there won’t 
be fraud in that system? 
It also takes away all voter IDs in 
every State, including my State, where 
there is not even a complaint about 
voter IDs on either side of the aisle be-
cause it is an incredibly fair system. It 
doesn’t require a driver’s license. It can 
require any piece of paper or any way 
to be able to show you are who you are. 
We have a straightforward system to 
be able to protect not only the integ-
rity of the ballot but to make sure 
every person is not only allowed to 
vote but is encouraged to vote. Why 
would we take that away from places 
where it is already working and there 
hasn’t been a complaint just because 
someone in Washington, DC, says we 
shouldn’t do it? 
Centralized 
control 
of 
voting 
in 
Washington, DC, seemed to be part of 
the theme of the night last night, 
where it was, everything would work 
better if it only came to DC. I tell you, 
I have met a lot of smart people in DC, 
but I can also tell you that I know a lot 
of smart people in Oklahoma who love 
their neighbors, who want to see the 
right thing done, who care about peo-
ple in their community and in their 
State. And this sudden belief that if we 
are going to get things done right, we 
have to bring it to Washington, DC, 
and allow the folks in Washington, DC, 
to be able to run it, I will tell you, the 
folks in my State would shake their 
heads and say: We are doing OK. Let us 
take care of our neighbors at home, 
and don’t make us sign a paper every 
time we want to do something and send 
it off to somebody we never met in 
Washington, DC. 
This growing in size of our Federal 
Government is not a goal for me. Being 
efficient, protecting the rights of every 
American, protecting our national se-
curity—those are goals. They don’t re-
quire federalizing everything. 
I can tell you a couple of areas where 
last night really had some shining mo-
ments for me, though. President Biden, 
twice in his speech, literally reached 
out to Republicans and said: I under-
stand Republicans have another idea 
on this. Let’s sit down and talk. 
That was a good moment. Quite 
frankly, for the last—let’s say of a 100- 
day Presidency so far, for 90 days of 
that, we have gotten the Heisman from 
the President and his team, saying: We 
have got this; we don’t need you. Then 
in the last really 10 days or so, the 
White House has started reaching out 
some. And to be able to hear President 
Biden last night say: We understand 
Republicans have a different idea; let’s 
sit down and visit—that almost sounds 
like governing. That would be a great 
shift for us, to be able to sit down and 
talk these things through. 
Republicans aren’t opposed to infra-
structure. How absurd to be able to 
make infrastructure a partisan issue. 
We have always done infrastructure to-
gether. It is not like any of us are op-
posed to highways and to waterways 
and to clean drinking water and to 
broadband. There are key aspects that 
are core to infrastructure. Let’s con-
tinue to be able to do those. Let’s do 
them efficiently and wisely. That is all 
that we would ask. 
I am pleased the President actually 
reached out and said: Let’s start sit-
ting down to be able to talk these 
things through, because that will allow 
us to be able to work together toward 
a better solution. 
The second big moment for me last 
night was listening to my friend and 
colleague TIM SCOTT speak about his 
family, speak about a vision for the 
country, to be able to challenge the 
country and to be able to challenge 
this body to be able to do what he 
called commonsense finding common 
ground. It is a great idea. 
We have different perspectives across 
the aisle in this building. That doesn’t 
mean we can’t sit down as Americans 
and be able to work them out. As TIM 
SCOTT reminded us, part of the story of 
America is a story of redemption. We 
can do that together. 
TIM also challenged this Nation to 
stop politicizing race, to stop saying 
over and over again that because we 
disagree, it is because we are racist. 
TIM spoke to the Nation and said there 
are real issues of race out there, and 
you cheapen it when you politicalize 
every issue and say it is because you 
are racist. 
Let’s actually sit down and disagree 
on issues as Americans, and let’s re-
solve those things together. We have 
common ground, and we have areas of 
real disagreement. I had lots of areas 
where I disagree with President Biden, 
but I am willing to sit down and lay 
out a set of ideas that I think are a 
much better option. Let’s talk it out. 
That is what we do. But let’s resolve 
these issues in the days ahead. 
And no, you are right, I am not going 
to give on the Second Amendment. I 
am not going to give on issues of life 
and the value of every child. I am not 
going to give on—I think the debt and 
deficit is a very important issue. I am 
not going to give on encouraging the 
value of work for every single person 
and every single family. There are 
areas I am not going to give on, but we 
should at least sit down and treat each 
other with dignity and respect, and 
let’s talk it out. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Alaska. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 593 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
as in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Committee on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transpor-
tation be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 593 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration. I 
ask unanimous consent that the Mur-
kowski amendment at the desk be 
agreed to; the bill, as amended, be con-
sidered read a third time and passed; 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
we talked a lot about the pandemic and 
all that it has brought. I would like to 
take just a few moments here, at the 
outset, before I ask for full consider-
ation, to share with colleagues, very 
briefly, what we have faced in the 
State of Alaska with regard to our 
State’s economy. We have probably 
taken a greater hit than any State in 
the country. 
We saw a 32-percent drop in revenue 
last year, 10 percent higher than any 
other State in the Nation. We are 
starting to see a light at the end of the 
tunnel, and that is good, but we are 
also facing the prospect of another dev-
astating tourist season. 
Back home, right now, people are not 
talking about the season for 2021 com-
ing up. The motto is ‘‘Get through to 
‘22.’’ That is an awful way to be ap-
proaching our situation so they have 
asked for help. They realize that any-
thing that we can do to try to salvage 
even a few weeks of the tourist season 
is going to be important to us. 
So Senator SULLIVAN and I have been 
working on behalf of hundreds of small 
businesses that rely on this essential 
income just so they can scrape by for 
another year. A lot of people don’t 
think about cruise ships as being an es-
sential activity during a pandemic but, 
let me tell you, in our State, where so 
much of our economy is based on tour-
ism, it is an imperative. It is jobs; it is 
livelihoods; and it really is what allows 
our small communities to keep their 
doors open. 
In 2019, before the pandemic was upon 
us, we were looking at 1.33 million 
tourists who came to the State of Alas-
ka by way of cruise ship. That is pretty 
significant. In 2020, there were 48 pas-
sengers. That is 48 passengers. That is 
not 48,000. So, in other words, you had 
an economy that was looking pretty 
strong and pretty good, and it abso-
lutely went into a free fall. 
Normally, the tourism industry gen-
erates more than $214 million in State 
and municipal revenue, more than $1.4 
billion in payroll, $2.2 billion in visitor 
spending, and the prospect was doing 
nothing but going up until we were hit 
in 2020. The vastly diminished cruise 
season contributed to statewide unem-
ployment rising from 6.2 percent to 11 
percent. Southeast Alaska had greater 
unemployment, which increased from 
4.7 to 11.3—17 percent of all jobs in the 
region impacted. 
This kind of unemployment and this 
kind of stress is an extraordinary chal-
lenge. So Alaskans are trying to figure 
out is there a way to salvage there, and 
there are two points here. 
We are ready to welcome visitors 
back in the State. We are leading the 
country in vaccination rates. Half of

April 29, 2021 
all Alaskans have had their first dose. 
So 43 percent are fully vaccinated, but 
we have got two issues that we are fac-
ing here; first is, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control has their no sail order for 
the cruise industry in place. We actu-
ally got some very encouraging news 
just last evening. CDC has acknowl-
edged these changing circumstances 
with regard to vaccination. They up-
dated their guidance for how to safely 
resume cruising, so that is good. That 
is a positive. 
But we have got a second issue, and 
that second issue is that Canada has a 
ban on allowing passenger vessels to 
depart from or transit through their 
waters. We are dealing with a law that 
is controlling so much of this because, 
in the United States, we only allow do-
mestically built, owned, and crewed 
vessels to operate on solely domestic 
trips. This is the Passenger Vessel 
Services Act, the PVSA. 
So we have got a situation that with-
out a stop in Canada, a cruise to Alas-
ka is a domestic ship. Canada has effec-
tively been available to cruise compa-
nies that offer voyages to Alaska—not 
built in the United States, not crewed 
by U.S. citizens, not permitted to sail 
in Alaska without making a stop in a 
foreign country because otherwise this 
violates the PVSA. So what we are try-
ing to do, we are trying to work with 
the Canadians to resolve this issue. It 
has been tough making headway be-
cause Canada is in a different spot 
when it comes to their vaccines. 
We have turned to a legislative fix, a 
temporary legislative fix. There are a 
lot of different opinions on PVSA and 
the Jones Act. I am not here to debate 
them today, but what I am trying to 
offer, along with Senator SULLIVAN, is 
a temporary fix that will allow the 
cruise ships to travel between Wash-
ington State and Alaska because what 
we are trying to do here—I am not try-
ing to save the cruise companies; I am 
trying to save communities that are so 
dependent on these vessels that bring 
these passengers up. 
For them, it is critical. If we can’t 
get some level of relief, and we can’t 
get folks north, they are not going to— 
they have been on hold now since last 
year. So 14 months until we get into 
2022, on top of what we have already 
seen, these businesses won’t be there. 
What we are doing is we temporarily 
deemed that a voyage to Alaska from 
Washington State without a stop in 
Canada is, by law, a foreign voyage. So 
PVSA is not going to hold us back. I 
have worked with Senator CANTWELL, 
and 
I 
have 
worked 
with 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL to address some of the 
issues that they have raised, and I 
thank them both for their efforts to 
work with me. 
We have incorporated, in this amend-
ment, three simple requirements—two 
of which the industry already adheres 
to—requiring defibrillators on ships, 
making sure that the passengers’ bill 
of rights is publicly available, and we 
asked the Secretary to consider a rule-
making on how to safely return human 
remains in the tragic event that some-
one passes away on a cruise. These are 
simple, commonsense changes that en-
sure cruises are safe for passengers and 
the crew. 
Along with Senator SULLIVAN
and 
Congressman YOUNG, I would ask the 
Senate to consider and pass the Alaska 
Tourism Recovery Act so that cruises 
can gain some semblance—some sem-
blance—of opportunity in Alaska, as 
they have for so long. 
So, again, I will restate my motion 
here asking unanimous consent that 
Murkowski amendment No. 593 be 
called up and agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the request? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut is recognized. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object, 
Senators MURKOWSKI
and SULLIVAN 
have ably represented the very serious 
plight of the people of Alaska. I am 
very sympathetic to the economic and 
humanitarian situation that prompts 
this effort, the Alaska Tourism Recov-
ery Act. 
But I must say that the cruise line 
industry has a very inconsistent—that 
is a nice way of putting it—and deeply 
inadequate record on consumer protec-
tion and worker safety. We worked out 
a number of amendments that are in-
corporated into this measure. They are 
basic protections during the pandemic 
and a negotiated compromise, and I 
thank my colleagues from Alaska for 
doing it in a way that really is a win- 
win for everyone, and that is the meas-
ure that is before us now. 
So I will offer no objection. I under-
stand that our colleague Senator LEE 
has an objection—I am not sure what 
they are at this point, but if he does, I 
look forward to working over the re-
cess with my Alaska colleagues to see 
if we can reach agreement with Sen-
ator LEE and resolve his objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, it would be a 
gross understatement to say that Alas-
ka 
tourism 
and, 
indeed, 
tourism 
around the country is suffering and has 
been throughout the pandemic. 
The cruise industry, which accounts 
for more than 50 percent of all tourists 
visiting Alaska every year, has been 
particularly decimated not only due to 
the pandemic but also because of an ar-
cane law passed by Congress back in 
1886. 
This law, known as the Passenger 
Vessel Services Act, or PVSA, states 
that no ship that is foreign built, for-
eign owned, foreign flagged, or foreign 
crewed may transport passengers be-
tween two U.S. ports or places. So in-
stead of operating continuously in U.S. 
waters, ships and cruise operators de-
parting from the United States are 
forced to make stops in foreign ports in 
order to remain in compliance with 
this 130-year-old law. 
In other words, we are literally ship-
ping our tourism and our economic ac-
tivity abroad to other countries and, in 
the process, we are destroying count-
less opportunities for our own coastal 
cities, States, and towns. 
Now, you don’t have to take my word 
for it. You can google this and see it 
for yourself. Cruises from the United 
States, if they leave from the United 
States, must make stops in Canada, 
Mexico, or Pacific Island States in 
order to avoid incurring the wrath and 
the heavy penalties of the Passenger 
Vessel Services Act. Instead of wel-
coming tourists and the dollars they 
spend into American ports, we drive 
them to Canada, to Mexico, and to Pa-
cific Island States. 
Does this law even succeed on its own 
protectionist terms? Does this law pro-
tect American shipbuilders? It decid-
edly does not. It decidedly does nei-
ther, in fact. Just to be clear, this is a 
point of differentiation here. I have 
made no secret about the fact that I 
don’t like the Jones Act. The Jones 
Act is a separate beast from this. They 
are both beasts. I dislike both of them 
intensely. I would repeal both of them 
today if I had the chance. I understand, 
at least, with respect to the Jones Act, 
what the arguments are as to why we 
would want to keep them intact. I 
strongly disagree with them, and I be-
lieve U.S. consumers pay for them 
dearly, especially in places like Puerto 
Rico and in places like Hawaii, in parts 
of New England, and in other places 
where they have more limited access to 
the goods that they might otherwise 
have access to in the absence of the 
Jones Act. 
There is a big difference between the 
PVSA and the Jones Act. At least with 
respect to the Jones Act, there are 
other considerations, and those consid-
erations do not exist with respect to 
the PVSA. 
Now, it is important to keep in mind, 
again, the difference between the Jones 
Act and the PVSA, which is that with 
the PVSA, we are dealing specifically 
with passenger vehicles, passenger ves-
sels. I am directing my remarks today 
to those passenger vessels in the large 
passenger vessel category; that is, 
those with at least 800 passenger berths 
or more. 
With respect to those, this is very 
significant because the United States 
has not built a single large cruise ship 
in over 60 years—not one, not a single 
one. With respect to large passenger 
vessels, this law is literally protecting 
no one. 
At least with respect to the Jones 
Act, people can point out: Well, per-
haps it is helping to nurture the U.S. 
shipbuilding industry. Again, I think 
that argument overlooks the fact that 
we are laying that burden on the backs 
of poor middle-class Americans in 
places like Puerto Rico and Hawaii and 
New England and Alaska and other

parts of the country. But at least I un-
derstand that, when there is an indus-
try at issue there. It is an industry 
that is being greedy, and it is an indus-
try that, really, is engaging in crony 
capitalism. But I understand the argu-
ment. 
With respect to the PVSA, we are not 
protecting anything because we do not 
make large passenger vessels in this 
country and haven’t for over half a 
century. And so by taking away oppor-
tunities for American jobs in dockside 
maintenance and repair, in ports and 
coastal 
cities, 
in 
hotels 
and 
res-
taurants, and in the travel support sec-
tor, this law, the PVSA, as applied to 
large passenger vessels, harms Amer-
ican workers, and it redirects the de-
mand elsewhere. 
It also harms consumers who have 
fewer options—fewer cruises that they 
can take, higher prices for those 
cruises that are offered. And as we 
have seen during the pandemic, it has 
left us subject to the will and whim of 
foreign powers. 
Make no mistake, the PVSA is not 
‘‘America first.’’ This is the encapsula-
tion of ‘‘special interests first’’ or even, 
you might say, ‘‘Canada first.’’ Perhaps 
this is the reason that the Canadian 
Government lobbies Congress to keep 
the PVSA in place. Think about that 
for a minute. 
This unfortunate situation has been 
exacerbated by the pandemic, during 
which Canada has closed its ports to 
cruise ships, making it, effectively, im-
possible for Alaskan cruises to carry 
on. But the only reason why Canada 
wields this tremendous authority over 
us is because of our own law—our own 
law that they are lobbying us to keep 
in place because they benefit from it, 
but they are shutting it down, making 
it impossible for Alaskan cruises for 
the time being. 
Without the necessary foreign port 
call, cruises simply cannot travel to 
Alaska. Without relief, the Alaskan 
tourism industry will evaporate, harm-
ing Alaskan dock workers, repairmen, 
those in the hospitality services, and 
more. 
Just the same, think about all the 
jobs that aren’t created that could oth-
erwise exist, that could exist tomorrow 
if we just got rid of this 130-year-old 
law that serves no purpose—the jobs, 
the vacation opportunities, especially 
in port States, not just Alaska but 
Florida, Louisiana, Texas, New York, 
and many, many others, places where 
cruise ships already depart but are se-
verely hobbled as to their itineraries 
because of this law, the PVSA, that 
serves no one—no one, perhaps, except 
these foreign powers. 
The CDC’s outdated no-sail order has 
made these matters so much worse, 
and we have to address those as well. 
Alaska already lost last summer’s 
season. That is tragic. I can’t imagine 
Congress would force them to lose yet 
another season now. Yet that might al-
ready be the case, you see, because un-
less they start moving those ships up 
there right now, there can’t be any 
cruise ship season for Alaska this sum-
mer. 
Now, my two colleagues from Alaska, 
thankfully, introduced a bill to help 
correct the issue by exempting certain 
Alaskan cruise lines from the PVSA for 
the duration of Canada’s border clo-
sure, a bill that I was happy to support 
in order to provide short-term relief for 
Alaska, even if it didn’t provide the re-
form needed for the long term, as we 
desperately need. 
Unfortunately, the bill that is now 
before us has deviated from that pur-
pose. It now has poison pill provisions 
that add duplicative, unnecessary, and 
unrelated regulations that will harm, 
not help, the cruise industry. 
Look, I remain ready, willing, and 
eager to negotiate the terms of this, 
but we have to provide relief. It is not 
just about an industry. It is not just 
about any one State. It is about the ac-
cess the American people have through 
their businesses or their own travel in-
terests. We should be able to do this. It 
makes no sense to anyone. No one 
could plan a road trip and say that we 
can’t go to a neighboring State unless 
we can touch back to a foreign country 
in the meantime. Nobody would fly to 
an adjacent State or across the coun-
try if, in the process, they had to fly to 
a third-party country merely in order 
to comply with some arcane Federal 
law—no one, except, of course, the very 
wealthy, who could still afford it. Most 
Americans can’t. 
And the Americans who can least af-
ford this law—this law that serves no 
one, perhaps, except the foreign inter-
ests I mentioned, including, but not 
limited to Canada—the people who 
really suffer for that, are America’s 
workers. Shame on us if we don’t fix 
that. 
Look, I remain hopeful, optimistic, 
and ever-willing to negotiate this. I 
have lots of amendments to offer up. In 
deference to my colleagues from Alas-
ka, I am going to hold off on counter-
proposing those right now. But I am 
filing them, and they are ready to go. 
I hope we can negotiate our way 
through this. If we can’t, shame on us. 
The PVSA is bad. It is bad news. We 
need to let it go. 
For these reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. WAR-
REN). The objection is heard. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
Madam President, my colleague Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI did a good job of ex-
plaining some of the economic chal-
lenges—actually, the dramatic eco-
nomic challenges—facing our State: 
small businesses, families, workers by 
the thousands who are really hurting 
right now because we lost the tourism 
season last year due to the pandemic 
and are on the verge, possibly, of losing 
another one, which could be dev-
astating. That is the purpose of our 
legislation, to focus on lifting the chal-
lenge and bringing relief so that we can 
bring tourism back to Alaska. We are 
open for business. 
You know, we have been able, in 
Alaska, to weather the health impacts 
of this virus in a way that we are proud 
of in Alaska, with one of the lowest 
death rates per capita—any death, of 
course, is horrible—but one of the low-
est death rates, one of the highest test-
ing rates per capita with regard to this 
vaccine, the highest vaccination rates 
per capita, which is a minimiracle if 
you look at how big our State is. But 
the economic impacts have been dev-
astating, as Senator MURKOWSKI laid 
out. Our commercial fishing industry, 
our oil and gas industry, our tourism 
industry—these sectors of the Alaska 
economy, which are critical, have lost 
thousands of jobs. 
So this bill, the Alaska Tourism Re-
covery Act, is something that is very 
narrowly focused. It is very narrowly 
focused. It is to give our State a fight-
ing chance this summer with regard to 
our tourism sector. 
Now, I very much appreciate Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and Senator LEE, with re-
gard to their passion and focus on the 
issues that they have raised tonight. 
Some of the safety regulations on 
cruise ships, the PVSA Act—these are 
issues that they feel very passionate 
about, and I appreciate that. 
As they know, what we are trying to 
do here, Senator MURKOWSKI and I, is 
not tackle those issues so much as to 
tackle the issue directly before Alas-
kans, and that is how to salvage a sum-
mer tourism season. 
So despite what you have witnessed 
here on the Senate floor, I want to say 
I appreciate their willingness to con-
tinue to work with us. The clock is 
ticking, 
but 
we 
do 
have 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL’s 
and 
Senator 
LEE’s 
strong commitments to work with us 
to resolve these issues—both the ones 
that they care about and, certainly, 
the ones that matter to Alaskans— 
very soon. 
To our fellow Alaskans, my message 
is, don’t give up right now. Here on the 
Senate floor, despite what you have 
seen, there has actually been momen-
tum and movement, and I am confident 
we can get there, and even with the 
CDC—even with the CDC. 
Some of you might recall that I was 
here on the floor last week with Sen-
ator SCOTT of Florida, trying to move 
our legislation relating to the CDC’s 
role here. We are starting to see 
progress with them. So we are going to 
continue to fight and continue to try 
to move this. 
Do not give up, Alaska, on our sum-
mer tourism. We haven’t. To the con-
trary, we have made progress. We are 
not there yet. 
Finally, to our Canadian friends, we 
are going to continue to work with all 
of you as well. You can be part of the 
solution to help Alaska, to help Can-
ada, in a cooperative spirit, as you are 
seeing here on the Senate floor from all 
of you on a number of these issues. It 
would be very much appreciated. 
I anticipate and look forward to 
reaching out to my colleague and

friend, the Minister of Transportation, 
and others in the Canadian Govern-
ment to try to make sure we can get 
this spirit of cooperation that will ben-
efit both our State, our country, and 
your country. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I just want to make clear after 
Senator LEE’s statement, No. 1, that I 
appreciate my colleagues from Alaska 
being as cooperative as they have been. 
These issues are a matter of vital 
consumer protection and worker safe-
ty. 
We 
are 
talking 
here 
about 
defibrillators and a requirement that 
there be certain minimum numbers on 
these ships. We are talking about bod-
ies, tragically, having to be returned if 
there is a death on one of these ships. 
We are talking about some rights for 
consumers that the industry itself has 
approved and that we are just incor-
porating into this amendment and ena-
bling the Department of Transpor-
tation to enforce. So I want to make 
clear that these are reasonable and, in 
fact, in my view, very minimal protec-
tions—a first-step, another step. 
I appreciate the agreement that we 
have been able to reach with our col-
leagues from Alaska on them, and I am 
disappointed that our colleague from 
Utah has objected. But I will do my 
best to work with them in trying to re-
solve Senator LEE’s objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
to just wrap up this discussion, I really 
appreciate the comments from my col-
league Senator SULLIVAN
because I 
think you have really keyed in on 
where we are today. 
The Alaska Tourism Restoration Act 
is such a narrowly defined in scope ini-
tiative to, again, create this very brief 
period of time to allow for what is left 
or what will remain of a tourist season 
to proceed. But we are faced with big-
ger issues, and these issues clearly 
evoke great passion and debate, wheth-
er it is consumer protection or to Sen-
ator LEE’s concerns that he has raised 
overall about Jones Act and PVSA. 
So those are significant issues that 
will be debated in committees as we 
move forward and further debated on 
the floor. But I think, at this point in 
time, the recognition from our col-
leagues from Connecticut and from 
Utah that this effort that we are trying 
to make in Alaska to redeem a small 
segment of our tourist season—those 
who come to us by cruise ship—that 
just perhaps the strength of coopera-
tion you see here today will be that 
level of encouragement for the ships to 
start coming north in anticipation of 
clearer and more beneficial guidance, 
working with CDC. 
It has been a lot of pieces to knit to-
gether. It hasn’t been particularly easy 
or pretty, but I would like to think 
that the folks in southeastern Alaska 
and throughout the State will see the 
benefits of this in the weeks and 
months ahead. 
With that, Madam President, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last 
night, the American people heard from 
President Biden in his first address to 
a joint session of Congress. The Amer-
ican people heard him speak about 
many of the same themes he touched 
on in his inauguration: unifying the 
country, healing the soul of our Na-
tion, healing the divisions that divide 
us. It sounds great, but those who have 
paid attention to the President’s ac-
tions know that his rhetoric and his 
actions don’t line up. 
The only legislative achievement so 
far for President Biden has been an 
eye-popping $1.9 trillion piece of spend-
ing that was branded as COVID–19 re-
lief. It was so controversial that our 
Democratic colleagues didn’t bother to 
use the standard legislative procedure. 
Instead, they used the budget reconcili-
ation process so they could make it a 
law without a single Republican vote— 
hardly coming together and unifying 
the country. 
As expected, President Biden had the 
audacity to brand this legislation as 
the reason why we have made such 
progress in fighting COVID–19. He tout-
ed the fact that America has provided 
more than 220 million COVID vaccina-
tions during his first 100 days in office. 
But he didn’t mention the fact that 
less than 1 percent of the funding in his 
signature 
legislation 
actually 
sup-
ported vaccinations—less than 1 per-
cent. Less than 10 percent was directly 
related to COVID–19 at all. 
If there were any doubts that this 
liberal spending binge was about to 
end, President Biden cleared that up 
last night too. He talked about his 
more than $2.6 trillion American Jobs 
Plan, which relies on a very generous 
interpretation of the word ‘‘infrastruc-
ture,’’ or should I say Orwellian. He 
discussed the $1.8 trillion American 
Families Plan, which includes every-
thing from universal preschool to free 
community college, to mandatory paid 
leave policies and tax provisions. 
You know, you have to love politi-
cians when they talk about giving 
away free stuff. The folks back home 
know better. Somebody has to pay for 
it. As my friend Senator TIM SCOTT 
said in the Republican response last 
night, these policies could put Wash-
ington even more in the middle of 
Americans’ lives, from cradle to col-
lege. 
These three proposals total more 
than $6 trillion—an amount so large, it 
is hard for any of us to wrap our head 
around it. That is on top of the money 
that was spent last year in a bipartisan 
effort to defeat COVID–19. The pro-
posals equate to a spending rate of $60 
billion a day during the President’s 
first 100 days in office. 
Six trillion dollars is one-quarter of 
our gross domestic product. If you con-
vert our country’s World War II spend-
ing into today’s dollars, the three 
Biden spending proposals are even 
more expensive than what it cost us to 
arm and defeat Imperial Japan and 
Nazi Germany. 
But I want to be clear. These aren’t 
wartime expenses. These aren’t even 
necessary expenses, in many cases. 
These proposals have absolutely noth-
ing to do with our current fight against 
COVID–19. Two hundred billion dollars 
to 
build 
or 
retrofit 
‘‘sustainable’’ 
places to live; $225 billion for paid fam-
ily leave; $178 billion on electric vehi-
cle chargers—more socialism for rich 
people; $400 billion for home-based 
care. This money adds up pretty quick-
ly. 
I am not saying our country should 
cut off all of our spending altogether. 
There are necessary expenses and in-
vestments that need to be made. But 
this is not the time for a spending 
binge. We need to make smart finan-
cial decisions that will serve the next 
generation, not drive them further and 
further into debt. 
The biggest question here, though, as 
with any type of government spending, 
is, How are you going to pay for it? For 
the Biden administration, the answer 
is simple: higher taxes. In fact, the 
President has proposed the largest tax 
hikes in more than half a century. 
Now, economics 101 would teach you 
that tax increases aren’t a clear and 
easy way to boost revenue, especially 
when your economy is already on a 
fragile footing. President Obama ob-
served as much when we were recov-
ering from the great recession of 2008, 
that raising taxes during a recovery 
from a recession is a bad idea. Raising 
trillions of dollars in new taxes will 
not set us up for a strong recovery; it 
will simply throw even more wrenches 
into our sluggish economic engine. 
Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
American economy was on a roll. The 
economy was booming. Unemployment 
was at a 50-year low. Companies were 
coming back on shore, moving their 
headquarters to the United States, in 
part because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
set the stage for this recovery. 
Instead of building upon what we did 
in 2017, the administration now wants 
to repeal those tax provisions in the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and double down 
on the old, tired talking points that 
America can simply tax and spend and 
regulate itself into prosperity. 
Massive tax hikes are not the way to 
stabilize a shaky recovery, and I worry 
how much damage these increases will 
do if our Democratic colleagues insist 
on doing more partisan, party-line leg-
islating. 
The President did nothing to ease my 
concern about another looming prob-
lem, and that is the crisis on our bor-
der. For months, the President and 
members of his administration have 
denied what is a clear and growing cri-
sis on the border. I hoped he might fi-
nally acknowledge the reality of the

April 29, 2021 
situation in his prime-time address and 
commit to working together with us to 
solve it, but no such luck. Instead, he 
talked about the need to provide a so-
lution for DACA recipients and under-
take broader immigration reform. 
I want to be clear here. I agree that 
Congress should take action to give 
DACA recipients the legal certainty 
and stability they deserve. This is a 
priority for folks on both sides of the 
aisle, and I hope we will finally be able 
to get a bill on the President’s desk to 
help these young people who have done 
nothing wrong. More broadly, there is 
no denying our immigration system is 
in need of reform. It is outdated and in-
efficient and simply doesn’t meet the 
needs of our country today. But we are 
not ready for those types of conversa-
tions until we solve the immediate cri-
sis at the border. 
Last month alone, more than 172,000 
migrants crossed our southern border, 
and 100,000 crossed in February. Nearly 
19,000 of those individuals who came 
across last month were unaccompanied 
children. 
We have seen migration in the past, 
surges, but never anything like this 
and never during a pandemic. There are 
serious risks to our law enforcement 
officials, our nongovernmental associa-
tions, and, of course, to the migrants 
themselves. 
Something needs to be done now be-
fore the crisis grows even larger. If you 
are cooking dinner for your family and 
the food in the oven catches on fire, are 
you going to keep stirring the pot on 
the stove? Are you going to set the 
table or call your kids to come down-
stairs for dinner? No. You are going to 
put the fire out first. That is what we 
need to do now. Before we can even 
have those necessary conversations 
about immigration reform, we need to 
put the fire out and put it out now. 
Once we have taken action on the 
border crisis, I hope we can have seri-
ous, bipartisan discussions about immi-
gration reform and finally provide 
DACA recipients the certainty they de-
serve, but that can’t happen until the 
crisis on the border is addressed. 
Like I said, I am disappointed that 
the President didn’t address this in his 
speech last evening. I was hoping he 
would be willing to work with a bipar-
tisan group of Senators and Congress-
men who are eager to take action. 
Last week, Senator SINEMA from Ari-
zona and I introduced the Bipartisan 
Border 
Solutions 
Act, 
a 
straight-
forward and commonsense way to ad-
dress this crisis. The bill already has 
the support of Members from both par-
ties and in both Chambers, as well as a 
number of respected organizations. We 
would be glad to gain the support of 
the administration as well. But you 
can’t solve a problem until you first 
acknowledge that you have a problem, 
and we have a problem with the crisis 
on the border. 
This is not going to get any better. 
We know that much of this migration 
is seasonal, and so the high numbers— 
more than 300,000 that we have seen so 
far this year—are going to translate 
into even more numbers next month 
and next month and next. So the time 
to deal with this is now, but, like I 
said, until the administration acknowl-
edges that there is a problem and that 
we need to work on it together, it is 
going to get nothing but worse. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, as I begin my remarks today, I 
first want to express my appreciation 
to Senator TIM SCOTT for the address 
that he gave last night following the 
joint address to Congress by the Presi-
dent. 
I so appreciated the remarks that he 
made, how he reminded us of the im-
portance of common sense and using 
that common sense to find common 
ground as we look to address the issues 
that affect our Nation, the issues that 
affect Tennesseans. That is such a 
timely reminder. I likewise appreciated 
his comments about the importance of 
reconciliation, one to another, and the 
importance of redemption as we, each 
and every one, go about our work each 
day, as we seek to help our Nation be-
come a more perfect Union. Timely re-
minders—well done and greatly appre-
ciated by many Tennesseans and indi-
viduals who have reached out to say: I 
was so touched by listening to TIM 
SCOTT and his remarks. 
Many of our Tennesseans have also 
expressed their concern with some of 
the provisions that were there in Presi-
dent Biden’s address. 
They felt as if this was something 
that kind of doubled down on decades 
of failed policies that were seeking to 
prioritize dependence on a welfare 
State overlooking at families and com-
munities but pushing that dependence 
on a welfare state. 
There 
really 
wasn’t 
anything 
groundbreaking that was there in the 
remarks, apart from the pricetag, 
which is eye-popping, and really will 
take your breath away when you stop 
and think about it. And for a long 
time, my Democratic colleagues have 
championed programs that treat people 
like individual clients instead of fami-
lies and communities. 
So, here we are, and we are staring 
down the Biden doctrine, and it is a 
commitment to spending trillions and 
trillions of dollars—trillions of dollars. 
We are talking about $6 trillion since 
January 20. This is astounding. And 
those 
dollars 
are 
being 
spent 
to 
incentivize dependence on the Federal 
Government to supplant the nuclear 
family with the Federal Government 
and to centralize control here in Wash-
ington, DC. 
If you don’t believe me, just take a 
little peek at what the Biden adminis-
tration has done during their first 100 
days. They started with a $1.9 trillion 
blue-State payday that bailed Demo-
crat-run cities out of the fiscal holes 
that they had made for themselves. 
Earlier this month, they introduced a 
$2.3 trillion—yes, trillion with a ‘‘t’’— 
trillion-dollar 
infrastructure 
boon-
doggle that would force families and 
businesses to rely on a government 
handout to comply with the mandates 
pulled directly from the Green New 
Deal. 
They even rolled out a total election 
overhaul that blatantly violates the 
Constitution by removing all control 
from the States and placing it right 
here 
in 
Washington, 
DC—removing 
from your local election commission, 
removing from your State legislature, 
and sending the authority to handle 
these elections to Washington, DC. 
And last night, during his address to 
a joint session of Congress, President 
Biden offered a few details on his 
American Families Plan, which, by all 
estimates—you got it, another big 
pricetag—$1.8 trillion. 
The numbers really are staggering. 
Not counting the cost of S. 1, these ef-
forts will cost the American people a 
combined $6 trillion. And we haven’t 
even factored in annual appropriations, 
which will add over $1 trillion to that 
grand total. 
Let’s put these numbers in context. 
We saw the national debt jump from 
$10.6 trillion. Now, that is the number 
where it was when President George 
Bush left office, $10.6 trillion. That is 
all the debt—every penny of Federal 
debt—that 
had 
accumulated 
from 
George Washington to George Bush. 
So $10.6 trillion, that is the debt 
total when President Obama took of-
fice. And then with the Obama-Biden 
administration, that debt nearly dou-
bled. When President Obama left of-
fice—that is right, you are looking 
over that 8-year period of time of right 
at doubling that debt. 
In his first 2 years in office, deficits 
increased 
so 
much 
that 
Admiral 
Mullen—then-Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff in 2010—declared the na-
tional debt to be the Nation’s top na-
tional security threat, our Nation’s 
debt. President Biden is on track to 
smash those records. 
Bear in mind these numbers: George 
Washington to George Bush, $10.6 tril-
lion. It nearly doubles as you have the 
Obama-Biden administration, and now 
since January 20, we are talking about 
$6 trillion. 
If your local city commission were 
spending money at this rate, you would 
be at city hall banging down the doors. 
But my Democratic colleagues are all 
on board, even though what they have 
actually put on paper is nothing but a 
series of wish lists they have wanted to 
start checking off since 2010. 
But those lists have a very important 
purpose. They curated them with so- 
called free programs and big promises 
that will serve two purposes: first, to 
persuade people to cede authority over 
their lives, families, businesses; and, 
second, to totally centralize power here 
in Washington, DC. 
It is truly stunning, truly stunning 
what my Democratic colleagues have

allowed themselves to propose. Last 
night, the President of the United 
States directly addressed the American 
people and said: Don’t think, just give 
us control. 
When he unveiled the American Fam-
ilies Plan, he spent a great deal of time 
on all of the wish list programs he 
hopes will eventually be sent to his 
desk for his signature but not a lot of 
time on how he plans to pay for these 
programs. 
I think it is important to state for 
the record that every program Presi-
dent Biden asked us to endorse has a 
cost. The Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget estimates that the 
American Families Plan alone—this 
one program—will result in a deficit 
impact of $300 billion over a decade— 
massive costs. 
President Biden claimed he can pay 
for all of this with taxes. He said: 
It’s time for corporate America and the 
wealthiest 1% to pay their fair share. 
And then he said that 55 of the Na-
tion’s biggest corporations made $40 
billion in profits that can and should 
be taxed. 
But here is the problem: Even if they 
were taxed 100 percent of their $40 bil-
lion in profits, that would pay for less 
than 1 percent of this administration’s 
proposed $7 trillion in total spending. 
And yet how did the President describe 
these programs? Universal pre-K, uni-
versal, free community college—free. 
Look at this pricetag. Families won’t 
have to spend a dime, won’t have to 
spend a dime on childcare. The Amer-
ican Families Plan will put money in 
your pocket. 
Now, as I said, universal, free—you 
won’t have to spend a dime; it is going 
to put money in your pocket. It is 
taken care of. Don’t think. Just take 
the deal. Do your part. 
Where does this money come from? 
Every single penny that comes into the 
Federal Treasury comes from the pock-
et of a U.S. taxpayer. That is where 
this money comes from. And the debt, 
that is going to be there for our chil-
dren and our grandchildren that have 
to sort it out long after these programs 
have outlived their usefulness, long 
after many of us are gone. 
We used to talk about spending mil-
lions and billions, and now it is tril-
lions. And, to me, I think about my 
grandkids, and I think about the fact 
that they haven’t earned a paycheck 
yet. But you know what? With all of 
this spending this year, they now have 
$80,000 of U.S. Federal debt that is 
their responsibility. 
And I think it is instructive for us to 
look at who is it that actually holds 
this debt. The biggest holder of our 
debt—someone goes to market and 
buys our debt, China. You also have 
OPEC, the cartel, in the top holders of 
our debt. 
My colleagues, this is an issue—not 
millions, not billions. This is some-
thing—this needs our best efforts and 
our best attention. 
Since his inauguration, President 
Biden spent a lot of time talking about 
unity. At the same time, he talks 
about eliminating the filibuster and 
passing legislation to entrench Demo-
cratic incumbents at the expense of 
voters. It is a power grab. 
He supported using the budget rec-
onciliation process to ram his $1.9 bil-
lion spending package through, and it 
appears he may do so again to pass the 
rest of the multitrillion-dollar agenda. 
Last night’s speech could have been 
an opportunity for him to seek com-
mon ground with congressional Repub-
licans. Much of the success of our coun-
try has had with the COVID vaccina-
tion is due, in large part, to Operation 
Warp Speed and previous administra-
tions, as well as bipartisan efforts in 
Congress. There was no mention of 
that. 
When the country was thrown into 
the COVID pandemic, Congress and 
President Trump passed the CARES 
Act, bipartisan, and four other major 
bipartisan COVID relief bills—no men-
tion of that. 
If we are going to heal, the Biden ad-
ministration 
must 
recognize 
the 
achievements of administrations past 
and the serious contributions that con-
gressional Republicans are ready and 
willing to make. 
For months now, I have come to the 
floor to ask my Democratic colleagues 
to take a breath, to take away the wish 
lists, and to focus on what the Amer-
ican people need—focus on their needs. 
The American people—when I am 
talking to Tennesseans, you know 
what they would like? They would like 
a little bit more money left at the end 
of their month and not too much 
month left at the end of their money. 
They want the hope that comes from 
opportunity, not the tangles of an eter-
nal safety net. They are independent. 
They are independent. They want a 
system that will, indeed, help them 
build their lives back better, as our 
President would like to say, but all 
that the White House has to offer is a 
plan that will flatten and rebuild the 
country and the broken image of failed 
policies that people have tried, and 
they just didn’t work. 
What they did do: destroyed our 
healthcare system, pushed tuition at 
public colleges and universities out of 
reach for low-income students, and 
they currently levy massive tax pen-
alties against working-class families 
who depend on each other and not the 
Federal Government. 
The Biden administration has set 
some lofty goals for itself. And I have 
to admit, the end results look pretty 
tempting on paper; that is, if you don’t 
look too close. 
There is a reason why the President 
has offered so few details about how his 
ideas would work in practice, and it is 
because he knows, without a doubt, 
that if this shows the true cost of sign-
ing on the dotted line that the people 
would not be with him in this effort. 
Throughout the pandemic, the Amer-
ican people kept each other safe and 
took care of their friends and neigh-
bors. When I talk to Tennesseans about 
church, I can tell what they really 
have as their values: faith, family, 
freedom, hope, opportunity. They un-
derstand that defending one of those 
virtues means defending them all for 
everybody. But they also understand 
the danger in allowing the government 
to step in and replace family and com-
munity with a bloated welfare state. 
They know it is dangerous to replace 
potential with sameness and to sup-
plant community with collectivism. 
That is exactly what the Biden ad-
ministration put on the table last 
night in very vague, poll-tested lan-
guage that really said nothing but 
threatened 
unprecedented 
levels 
of 
government control. But I suppose 
from their perspective, you don’t need 
details when all you are really asking 
your fellow countrymen to do is to sub-
mit; just take the deal. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO SCOTT MAGERS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
one family in Southcentral Kentucky 
has waited more than 70 years to give 
their hero a proper tribute. Last year, 
the 
Defense 
POW/MIA 
Accounting 
Agency, DPAA, identified the remains 
of Navy Seaman 2nd Class Howard 
‘‘Scott’’ Magers from Barren County. 
Over Memorial Day weekend, a grate-
ful nation will honor this Kentuckian’s 
sacrifice as he finally comes home. I 
would like to take a moment today to 
add my personal gratitude for Scott’s 
service and his family’s sacrifice. 
Those who knew Scott remembered a 
soft-spoken young man with a kind 
heart and a winning smile. In January 
1941, he enlisted in the Navy at the age 
of 17. Like millions of other men and 
women of the ‘‘greatest generation,’’ 
Scott put his own ambitions on pause 
to defend the country he loved. After 
completing his training and making 
one trip home to Kentucky before his 
18th birthday, Scott was stationed 
aboard the USS Oklahoma at Pearl Har-
bor on December 7, 1941. 
On that Sunday morning, the Japa-
nese forces rained bombs down on 
unsuspecting American sailors. Tor-
pedoes pummeled the Oklahoma, tear-
ing open her hull and igniting an in-
ferno inside. Within minutes, the mas-
sive ship capsized, and more than 400 of 
its crew plunged into the water below.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2349 
April 29, 2021 
In the chaos, more than 2,400 Amer-
ican servicemembers lost their lives. 
The tragic events of that morning elic-
ited a forceful response as the United 
States entered the Second World War. 
Over the next 4 years, heroes were 
forged on the battlefield and at home 
as our country defeated the forces of 
tyranny in defense of the American 
way of life. 
Like 
thousands 
of 
families, 
the 
Magers could only wonder and pray 
over Scott’s fate. Although he would 
never make it home, he had sent a tele-
graph before the bombing to his loved 
ones in Kentucky. In a message deliv-
ered on Christmas Eve, Scott shared 
his love and his holiday cheer. His 
loved ones held tight to this last com-
passionate connection to Scott that re-
flected his best qualities. 
In the following years, the Navy at-
tempted to identify the remains of 
those killed on the Oklahoma. Unfortu-
nately, the vast majority couldn’t be 
accounted for and were buried together 
in 46 plots at the National Memorial 
Cemetery of the Pacific, also known as 
the Punchbowl. 
In 2015, the DPAA exhumed the USS 
Oklahoma Unknowns. Using DNA as 
dental, and other identifying records, 
they were finally able to identify 
Scott’s remains and give his family the 
opportunity for proper burial in Ken-
tucky. 
Over 1,300 Kentucky servicemembers 
remain unaccounted for by the DPAA. 
We have never forgotten these patriots, 
and we will continue searching to bring 
them home. I am grateful for the ongo-
ing efforts of the DPAA to bring clo-
sure to more families like this one. 
On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I 
would like to send our sincere condo-
lences to Scott’s family and express 
our thanks for his brave service to our 
Nation. We are proud this Kentucky 
hero will receive the honor he earned.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, today I missed the vote on pas-
sage of S. 914, as amended, in order to 
attend an event related to vaccine dis-
tribution in Baltimore City with Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS. Had I been 
in attendance, I would have voted yes 
on this important, bipartisan bill. 
f 
SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN 
INNOVATION ACT 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
would like to thank my colleague from 
Ohio for working together on a bipar-
tisan package of legislation that will 
increase our economic competitiveness 
and strengthen our national security. 
As chairman and ranking member of 
the Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee, we are pre-
paring legislation that will help our 
country respond to major cyber inci-
dents, solidify our global leadership on 
artificial intelligence, incentivize do-
mestic production of personal protec-
tive equipent to increase our ability to 
respond to pandemics, and strengthen 
‘‘Buy American’’ laws to make sure 
Federal 
dollars 
support 
American 
workers and small businesses. 
I would like to briefly discuss one of 
the bills we are working on—my col-
league’s Safeguarding American Inno-
vation Act, which takes on the threat 
of foreign governments stealing Amer-
ican taxpayer-funded research and in-
tellectual property developed at U.S. 
colleges and universities. This is a seri-
ous, complex problem, and we need to 
make sure we get the response right. 
This is why we plan to advance this bill 
out of committee and continue work-
ing through additional changes before 
this bill is incorporated to the Endless 
Frontier Act on the Senate floor. 
We intend to move a number of bills 
out of our committee, including the 
Safeguarding American Innovation Act 
after the recess and include them in bi-
partisan competitiveness legislation. If 
this broader package is considered on 
the Senate floor during the first week 
of the next work period, we will focus 
on preparing a bipartisan package from 
our committee’s jurisdiction to be 
added during floor consideration. 
I know my colleagues and the admin-
istration have concerns about potential 
overlapping authorities, visa restric-
tions, and the reporting requirements 
for foreign gifts to colleges and univer-
sities, among other issues, I believe we 
must work through these in a bipar-
tisan manner. As a result of Senator 
PORTMAN’ s important work and others 
in Congress, there has been positive 
movement already to address these 
issues by both the U.S. Government 
and institutions of higher education, 
which have been educating their staff 
and faculty about their serious respon-
sibilities to disclose any foreign re-
search support they receive. I will yield 
to Senator PORTMAN
to discuss the 
process we have agreed to undertake in 
the coming weeks and thank him again 
for engaging in this collaborative proc-
ess. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Thank you. I am 
committed to advancing our commit-
tee’s competitiveness legislation in the 
manner laid out by my colleague from 
Michigan. I appreciate the work we 
have put into this package to date. As 
we prepare to dramatically increase in-
vestment in our research institutions 
and emerging technologies, the Safe-
guarding 
American 
Innovation 
Act 
must be a part of any competitiveness 
legislation. We must protect the intel-
lectual property behind the revolu-
tionary discoveries and advances being 
made across our Nation. This whole-of- 
government approach to get the Fed-
eral Government’s house in order ad-
dresses a far-ranging problem and im-
plicates the jurisdiction of other com-
mittees including the HELP Com-
mittee and the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. I appreciate that the chairs and 
ranking members of those committees 
want to continue negotiations on this 
bill. I understand some changes to this 
legislation will be needed before it 
passes the Senate floor. That said, this 
legislation is the result of several years 
of bipartisan investigatory work by 
Senator CARPER and myself during our 
time as chair and ranking member of 
the Permanent Subcommittee on In-
vestigations. 
I am committed to working with 
committees of jurisdiction, the major-
ity leader, Chairman PETERS, and the 
administration to reach an agreement 
on this text in the coming weeks before 
it will be added to the Endless Frontier 
Act. I am also committed to con-
tinuing to engage with key stake-
holders including our institutions of 
higher education. I am ready to put in 
the work and find a path forward here. 
The threat is real, and we need to ad-
dress it now. I look forward to working 
with my colleague from Michigan to 
pass this legislation, along with other 
important measures before our com-
mittee, as soon as possible. 
While I am a cosponsor of Endless 
Frontier Act and believe it provides an 
important increase in funding to the 
National Science Foundation, if we 
don’t take the basic steps outlined in 
the Safeguarding American Innovation 
Act, these funds may contribute to 
China’s rise instead of improving the 
competitiveness of the United States, 
as intended. 
Mr. PETERS. Thank you, Senator 
PORTMAN. You have my commitment 
to work closely together on this multi- 
committee process. I believe we can 
find common ground with our col-
leagues and an agreement with the ad-
ministration and Leader SCHUMER in 
the coming weeks. Thank you for your 
partnership on these important issues. 
I look forward to advancing an impor-
tant, bipartisan Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs Committee 
package and ensuring our priorities are 
included in the final bill passed by the 
Senate. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Let me take a mo-
ment at the end to make a few points. 
First, the issue of China’s predatory 
actions against American intellectual 
property is one that we must address as 
part of the competition bill. Second, 
my friends from Ohio and Delaware, 
Senators PORTMAN and CARPER, are to 
be commended for their work on this 
issue in the Permanent Subcommittee 
on Investigations. Third, I have com-
mitted to work with Chairman PETERS, 
Ranking Member PORTMAN, and other 
relevant committee chairs and ranking 
members to reach an agreement on the 
text of the Safeguarding American In-
novation Act so that it can be included 
in the Endless Frontier legislation.

TRIBUTE TO EMILY KIM AE SUN 
HUNTER 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
am proud to recognize Emily Kim Ae 
Sun Hunter of Chester as April’s Gran-
ite Stater of the Month. In response to 
the surge in hate crimes against Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders, AAPI, 
Emily is organizing a peaceful gath-
ering in downtown Portsmouth to dem-
onstrate support for New Hampshire’s 
AAPI community. 
Emily was born in Seoul, South 
Korea. When she and twin sister were 5 
months old, they were adopted by a 
couple in New Hampshire. Growing up 
in a predominantly White community, 
Emily and her sister quickly learned 
what it was like to be the only people 
of color in a room. The sisters were 
also the target of hate, which left a 
lasting impression on both of the girls. 
Emily—now a mentor for Asian- 
American women at her company and a 
strong voice in the AAPI community— 
was shocked and horrified, as so many 
Americans were, by the mass shooting 
in Atlanta, GA, that left eight people 
dead, including six women of Asian de-
scent. 
In response, Emily decided to take 
action by organizing a peaceful gath-
ering to show support for the AAPI 
community and help share resources to 
combat discrimination. Emily, who has 
never organized an event like this be-
fore, has also taken to social media and 
raised more than $6,500 for AAPI orga-
nizations across the country. 
Emily’s dedication to uplifting mem-
bers of the AAPI community and en-
couraging others to do the same em-
bodies the best of the Granite State. 
Amid a challenging time for the AAPI 
community, Emily has shown true 
strength by elevating her message of 
inclusivity and acceptance. I am hon-
ored to name her as a Granite Stater of 
the Month as we join together to stand 
with the AAPI community and con-
demn the un-American attacks that we 
have seen.∑

TRIBUTE TO NICK ARCHER 
∑ Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to an exceptional 
man in my home State of Maine, Nick 
Archer. I have been so fortunate to 
have been surrounded by outstanding 
people both as my time as Governor of 
Maine, as a private citizen of Maine, 
and now as U.S. Senator. Some of those 
people have been woven into my world 
through all facets of my career, and 
Nick Archer is one of those individuals. 
Nick recently retired from the Maine 
Department of Environmental Protec-
tion after nearly 35 years of employ-
ment. But to Nick—and thankfully for 
all of us Mainers—his position at 
Maine DEP was more than a job. His 
interest in protecting the environment 
spans over four decades and extends 
into so many of his passions in life. Not 
being one to shy away from difficulty, 
Nick understood the history and the 
importance of industry, agriculture, 
and forestry in Maine but also realized 
the environment needed to be pro-
tected for the vibrant future of Maine’s 
land 
and 
waterways. 
He 
worked 
throughout his career to build partner-
ships and build on communications be-
tween the two and was known for his 
common sense and matter-of-fact ap-
proach. Nick’s approach was always in 
the spirit of compromise but firmly 
rooted in the protection of our great 
resources. Solution focused—he set ex-
pectations high for integrity, innova-
tion, and ingenuity and enjoyed think-
ing outside the box. 
As if his career wasn’t impactful 
enough, Nick also gave his time to so 
many community service activities. An 
avid outdoorsman, he was in leadership 
roles at both the local and State levels 
in Fish and Game Clubs and Sports-
man’s Alliance of Maine. If there was a 
need at a fishing derby or any outdoor 
activity involving youth engagement, 
Nick Archer was the first to sign up 
and donate both time and money. He is 
a cheerleader for a myriad of causes 
from veterans organizations to local 
Rotary clubs. I am thankful Nick is 
staying in the great State of Maine for 
his next chapter and spending time 
with his favorite people, his family. 
In Maine, we are blessed with people 
who have exceptional work ethic and a 
piece of their heart in their commu-
nities and those people often do not 
want any recognition. I am sure Nick 
is one of those people, but having 
known him, having his assistance to 
my office staffers, and knowing his 
truly altruistic nature, I will take the 
risk and am so proud to honor him and 
his dedicated service and commitment 
to the State of Maine and to the com-
munities it encompasses.∑

REMEMBERING DR. MALCOLM

Dorman for nearly four decades. He

and would do anything for them. He 
was a man of great faith, served his 
synagogue faithfully, and steadfastly 
supported many Jewish causes. In 1995 
he was awarded the Man of the Year 
Award by Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu, and in 2006, he was awarded 
the Distinguished Guardian of Israel 
Award by Shimon Peres, former Prime 
Minister of the State of Israel and 
Nobel Peace Prize Winner. 
Dr. Dorman was a spectacular sur-
geon who saved many lives and exuded 
compassion and love for his patients. 
For 25 years, he served as the chairman 
of the Department of Cardiovascular 
Surgery and cochairman of the Depart-
ment of Cardiovascular Medicine at the 
Miami Heart Institute. He then moved 
to the JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, 
FL, where he was the medical director 
of cardiac surgery and established and 
directed the Valvular Heart Institute. 
Along with the countless patients he 
helped heal, Dr. Dorman invested in 
the growth of students as a member of 
the Florida Atlantic University Board 
of Trustees and FAU’s Charles E. 
Schmidt College of Medicine Advisory 
Board. He selflessly gave his time and 
effort to serve others and help them 
grow into all that they could be. 
Ann and I are praying for all of Dr. 
Dorman’s family, friends, and loved 
ones. He exemplified what it means to 
love and to serve and was a dependable 
friend I looked up to. We mourn this 
very heavy loss, but we are blessed to 
have known Dr. Dorman and to call 
him a friend.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. 
BROWN, 
Ms. 
CANTWELL, 
Mr. 
CARDIN, and Mr. WHITEHOUSE): 
S. 1443. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to permit treat-
ment of student loan payments as elec-
tive deferrals for purposes of employer 
matching contributions, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
Mr. 
WYDEN. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have introduced the Retire-
ment Parity for Student Loans Act. 
This legislation would permit employ-
ers to make matching contributions to 
workers under 401(k) and similar types 
of retirement plans as if a worker’s 
student loan payments were salary re-
duction contributions to the retire-
ment plan. This legislation will help 
workers who cannot afford to both save 
for retirement and pay off their stu-
dent loan debt by providing them with 
employer contributions to build their 
retirement savings. This legislation is 
a common sense fix to the rules that 
govern employer-sponsored retirement 
plans and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. I ask unanimous 
consent that this bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
bill was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
S. 1443 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Retirement 
Parity for Student Loans Act’’. 
SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF STUDENT LOAN PAY-
MENTS AS ELECTIVE DEFERRALS

graph (13), any employer contribution made 
to a defined contribution plan on behalf of an 
employee on account of a qualified student 
loan payment.’’. 
(b) QUALIFIED STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT.— 
Paragraph (4) of section 401(m) of the Inter-

‘‘(i) to the extent such payments in the ag-
gregate for the year do not exceed an

‘‘(I) the limitation applicable under section 
402(g) for the year (or, if lesser, the employ-
ee’s compensation (as defined in section 
415(c)(3)) for the year), reduced by 
‘‘(II) the elective deferrals made by the em-
ployee for such year, and 
‘‘(ii) if the employee certifies to the em-
ployer making the matching contribution 
under this paragraph that such payment has 
been made on such loan. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the term 
‘qualified higher education expenses’ means

actment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997)

poses of subparagraph (A)(iii), subsection 
(a)(4), and section 410(b), matching contribu-
tions described in paragraph (4)(A)(iii) shall

cation loan (as defined in section 221(d)(1)). 
‘‘(ii) STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS NOT TREATED 
AS PLAN CONTRIBUTION.—Except as provided 
in clause (iii), a qualified student loan pay-

employee under subparagraph (A)(i)(I) to the 
extent such payments do not exceed— 
‘‘(I) the applicable dollar amount under 
subparagraph (E) (after application of sec-
tion 414(v)) for the year (or, if lesser, the em-

described in section 401(m)(13).’’.

fort to end preventable deaths of moth-
ers, newborns, and young children in 
the developing world by 2030. 
For years Sen. COONS and I have led 
efforts to ensure robust funding for the 
U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment’s maternal and child health pro-
graming, which have formed the back-
bone of the U.S. commitment to help 
end preventable child and maternal 
deaths globally. 
Due in part to American leadership 
and generosity, many lives have al-
ready been saved. Nevertheless, far too 
many mothers, newborns, and young 
children under the age of five continue 
to succumb to disease and malnutri-
tion that could easily be prevented. 
The impacts of COVID–19 are exacer-
bating these gaps and disproportion-
ately affecting the world’s most vul-
nerable, 
undermining 
decades 
of 
progress. 
Nearly 300,000 women die annually 
from causes related to pregnancy and 
childbirth. In addition, a significant 
proportion of deaths of children under 
the age of five occur in the first 28 days 
after birth, with newborns accounting 
for nearly 50 percent of all under-five 
deaths. In 2019, 5.2 million children 
under the age of five died from mainly 
preventable and treatable diseases. 
Our bill aims to reach these mothers 
and children with simple, proven, cost- 
effective interventions that we know 
will help them survive. A concentrated 
effort could end preventable maternal 
and child deaths worldwide by the year 
2030, but continued U.S. leadership and 
support from the international commu-
nity are critical to success. 
To achieve this ambitious goal, our 
bill would require the implementation 
of a strategy focused on bringing to 
scale the highest impact, evidence- 
based interventions, with a focus on 
country and community ownership. 
These interventions would be specific 
to each country’s needs and include 
support for the most vulnerable popu-
lations. We do not have to guess at 
what interventions will work—the re-
ality is that thousands of children die 
each day of conditions we know today 
how to treat. 
These life-saving interventions in-
clude clean birthing practices, vac-
cines, nutritional supplements, hand- 
washing with soap, and other basic 
needs that remain elusive for far too 
many women and children in devel-
oping countries. This must change. 
In addition, our bill proposes the es-
tablishment a Maternal and Child Sur-
vival Coordinator at USAID who would 
focus on implementing the five-year 
strategy and verifying that the most

effective interventions are being scaled 
up in target countries. The bill would 
improve government efficiency across 
several agencies that would collaborate 
with the Coordinator to identify and 
promote the most effective interven-
tions to end preventable maternal and 
child deaths globally. 
To promote transparency and greater 
accountability, our bill also would also 
require detailed public reporting on 
progress 
toward 
implementing 
the 
strategy. 
Other bipartisan initiatives, such as 
the successful President’s Emergency 
Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, 
which was started by President George 
W. Bush, demonstrate that results 
driven interventions can turn the tide 
for global health challenges. Applying 
lessons learned from past initiatives, 
our bill would provide the focus and 
the 
tools 
necessary 
to 
accelerate 
progress toward ending preventable 
maternal and child deaths. 
I urge my colleagues to join Senator 
COONS and me in supporting this legis-
lation that will save the lives of moth-
ers and children around the world. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 1459. A bill to provide for the pro-
tection of and investment in certain 
Federal land in the State of California, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the ‘‘Protecting Unique 
and Beautiful Landscapes by Investing 
in California (PUBLIC) Lands Act.’’ 
This measure would increase protec-
tions for over 1 million acres of Federal 
public 
lands 
throughout 
northwest 
California, the Central Coast, and Los 
Angeles, including nearly 600,000 acres 
of new wilderness, more than 583 miles 
of new wild and scenic rivers, and the 
expansion 
of 
an 
existing 
national 
monument by more than 100,000 acres. 
This legislation would preserve our 
public lands for the benefit of current 
and future generations and help pro-
tect California’s communities from the 
impacts of the climate crisis. 
The ‘‘PUBLIC Lands Act’’ is ground-
ed in the best conservation principles: 
it expands access to the outdoors for 
all, addresses disparities in access to 
nature, supports locally led efforts, and 
is based on science. 
In Northwest California, this bill 
would designate new wilderness, wild 
and scenic rivers, recreation and con-
servation areas, and forest and water-
shed restoration areas. Importantly, it 
would increase wildfire resiliency in 
Northwest California, where the im-
pacts of the climate crisis have re-
sulted in more frequent and severe 
wildfires. 
Along the Central Coast, the bill 
would designate nearly 250,000 acres of 
public land in the Los Padres National 
Forest and Carrizo Plain National 
Monument as wilderness, and establish 
a 400-mile long Condor National Recre-
ation trail, stretching from Los Ange-
les to Monterey County. The designa-
tions in the bill would protect the Cen-
tral Valley’s abundant biodiversity, in-
cluding threatened and endangered spe-
cies. 
In Southern California, the bill would 
expand the San Gabriel Mountains Na-
tional Monument and establish a new 
National Recreation Area along the 
foothills and San Gabriel River cor-
ridor. Los Angeles County is one of the 
most park-poor, densely populated, and 
polluted regions in the Nation—this 
legislation would begin to rectify that 
by providing increased outdoor oppor-
tunities for all Angelenos, ensuring 
that disadvantaged communities can 
more easily benefit from our public 
lands. 
I want to highlight that this legisla-
tion protects existing water rights, 
property rights, and land-use authori-
ties. The bill does not create any new 
public lands—rather, it protects exist-
ing public lands through the high-value 
designation as wilderness in order to 
keep these lands as untouched and wild 
as possible. 
The science is becoming increasingly 
clear that we must conserve 30 percent 
of our lands and waters by 2030 in our 
efforts to solve the climate crisis, pro-
tect nature, and save America’s wild-
life. This legislation would provide a 
down payment on that goal, helping 
California and the Biden Administra-
tion meet our 30x30 goals and reverse 
the worst effects of climate change. 
The bill would also provide outdoor 
recreation opportunities to park-poor 
communities. It is imperative that as 
we conserve our public lands, we do so 
in a way that also reverses racial and 
economic disparities in access to na-
ture and parks. 
This bill enjoys the support of hun-
dreds of local municipalities and elect-
ed officials, community groups, and 
businesses and local outfitters. It is the 
product of significant public engage-
ment in the legislative process over 
decades. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
and 
conservation 
champions, 
Rep-
resentatives JARED
HUFFMAN, SALUD 
CARBAJAL, and JUDY CHU, for cham-
pioning these bills in the House. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to pass the ‘‘PUBLIC Lands 
Act’’ as quickly as possible. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor.

cover crops through a separate plan or policy 
of insurance. 
‘‘(C) REPORT.—Not later than 18 months 
after the date of enactment of this para-
graph, the Corporation shall make available 
on the website of the Corporation, and sub-
mit to the Committee on Agriculture of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of 
the Senate, a report that— 
‘‘(i) describes the results of the research 
and development carried out under subpara-
graph (A); and 
‘‘(ii) includes any recommendations with 
respect to those results.’’. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, along 
with my livestock producer protection 
bill, I am also introducing legislation 
today to eliminate the November 1 
haying and grazing date for cover 
crops. 
Cover crops provide a lot of environ-
mental benefits. They improve soil 
health, reduce erosion and nutrient 
runoff, improve water quality, and se-
quester carbon. They also benefit farm-
ers, since their animals can graze these 
crops, or the cover crops can be har-
vested to provide forage for livestock. 
Currently, the haying and grazing 
date—the date on which farmers can 
start 
harvesting 
or 
grazing 
cover 
groups on prevent plant acres—is set 
for November 1, which is too late in the 
year for farmers in more northern 
States like South Dakota. Early winter 
weather in these States can cause 
cover crops to freeze before they can be 
used for hay and grazing. 
The legislation I am introducing 
today with my colleague Senator STA-
BENOW would fix this problem by let-
ting farmers harvest and graze cover 
crops outside of the primary nesting 
season, which ends August 1 in South 
Dakota, allowing for both farmers and 
our environment to benefit from these 
crops. 
Protecting our planet is imperative, 
and government certainly has a role to 
play in promoting clean energy and 
sound environmental policy, but put-
ting the government in charge of our 
economy—in fact, putting the govern-
ment in charge of pretty much every 
aspect of American life, as the Green 
New Deal would do—is not the answer. 
Innovation, not government, is the key 
to 
addressing 
environmental 
chal-
lenges. 
Unfortunately, President Biden is 
embracing a whole host of Green New 
Deal-like policies. Take his so-called 
30-by-30 directive directing the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture and other 
Agencies to provide recommendations 
to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and 
waters by 2030. 
I have already heard from ranchers 
and landowners in South Dakota who 
are concerned about the measures the 
administration could pursue to meet 
this goal, including Federal land acqui-
sitions and burdensome regulations on 
private landowners, many of whom are 
already doing everything they can to 
promote the health of their land. 
There is also serious reason to doubt 
the government’s ability to manage a 
vast new amount of land. The Federal 
Government already frequently fails to 
properly manage the land it already 
has. Yet some believe that we can give 
the Federal Government huge new 
swaths of land, and somehow the gov-
ernment will manage it properly. 
Yet that is the problem with a lot of 
these socialist fantasies. They assume 
that the government will achieve lev-
els of efficiency and productiveness 
that the government has simply never 
demonstrated. It is the triumph of fan-
tasy over experience. Surely, the peo-
ple espousing socialist fantasies have 
sat in long lines at the DMV or remem-
ber how the Obama administration had 
more than 3 years to prepare for the 
opening of the ObamaCare exchange 
yet couldn’t even come up with a work-
ing website in that time period. Yet 
the Green New Deal’s proponents are 
advocating that we put the government 
in charge of pretty much every aspect 
of American life. 
Socialists 
and 
the 
Democrats 
parroting their ideology don’t want to 
believe it, but the truth is that private 
individuals are often a lot more effi-
cient, effective, and innovative than 
government, and we should be focusing 
our energies on supporting that effi-
ciency and effectiveness and innova-
tion instead of attempting to solve our 
environmental problems by giving the 
government more than it can handle. 
I will continue working here in Con-
gress to advance policies that promote 
clean energy and improve our environ-
ment without placing heavy burdens on 
American workers or American fami-
lies. I will continue to advocate for 
policies that encourage and harness the 
ingenuity of the American people in 
facing our environmental challenges, 
and I will continue to oppose legisla-
tion that prioritizes supposed environ-
mental gains over the well-being of the 
American people. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. PORTMAN, and Ms. BALD-
WIN): 
S. 1469. A bill to amend the McKin-
ney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to 
meet the needs of homeless children, 
youth, and families, and honor the as-
sessments and priorities of local com-
munities; to the Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to reintroduce bipartisan 
legislation that would better align the 
Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment’s (HUD) homeless assistance 
programs with other federal agencies’ 
homelessness programs and provide 
greater flexibility to local commu-
nities to address youth homelessness. 
According to the latest estimate 
from HUD, there are over 580,466 home-
less individuals in the United States. 
This number includes an estimated 
161,548 individuals in California, includ-
ing children and youth. 
However, if you compare that with 
data from other federal agencies, a dif-
ferent story is told. 
For example, the Department of Edu-
cation identified 1.3 million students 
experiencing homelessness during the 
2018–2019 school year. This includes an 
estimated 271,528 public school stu-
dents in California, almost double the 
total number of homeless individuals 
(including adults) identified by HUD in 
California. 
The disparity between the homeless 
numbers reported by HUD and the De-
partment of Education are not just 
mere statistical differences; they have 
real consequences. 
For instance, only those children and 
families considered ‘‘homeless’’ under 
HUD’s definition are eligible for vital 
homeless assistance programs. Those 
children and families who do not meet 
HUD’s definition will therefore con-
tinue to fall through the cracks. 
Our bill would allow HUD homeless 
assistance programs to serve extremely 
vulnerable children and families, spe-
cifically those staying in motels or in 
doubled-up 
situations 
because 
they 
simply have nowhere else to go. 
These children are especially suscep-
tible to abuse and trafficking because 
they are often not served by a case 
manager, and therefore remain hidden 
from potential social service providers. 
Communities that receive Federal 
funding through HUD’s competitive ap-
plication process are also unable to 
prioritize or direct resources to help 
children and families who don’t meet 
the current definition of ‘‘homeless-
ness.’’ 
In addition to fixing the issue with 
competing federal definitions of home-
lessness, our bill would provide com-
munities with new flexibility to use 
Federal funds the way they see fit to 
address local needs. Our bill requires 
HUD to assess the extent to which Con-
tinuums of Care use separate, specific, 
age-appropriate 
criteria 
for 
deter-
mining the safety and needs of children 
and unaccompanied youth and divert 
people to safe, stable, age-appropriate 
accommodations. 
Finally, 
our 
bill 
would 
improve 
transparency and give a better sense of 
the homeless crisis facing our country 
by requiring HUD to include data on 
all categories of homelessness in its 
Point in Time count and Annual Home-
less Assessment Report. 
Mr. President, we must do more to 
meet the needs of homeless children 
and youth and stop the vicious cycle of 
poverty and chronic homelessness. As 
the 
ongoing 
coronavirus 
pandemic 
threatens 
to 
push 
more 
children, 
youth, and families into homelessness 
and continues to pose potentially le-
thal health risks, it is imperative that 
we do not impose more barriers for 
these children and families to access 
services. I believe this bill is a com-
monsense solution that will ensure 
that homeless families and children 
can receive the help they need. 
I would like to thank Senator ROB 
PORTMAN for his support on this crit-
ical issue and for joining me in intro-
ducing this bill, and I implore our col-
leagues to support the ‘‘Homeless Chil-
dren and Youth Act.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2361 
April 29, 2021 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. BROWN, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, and Mrs. GILLIBRAND): 
S. 1474. A bill to reaffirm the impor-
tance of workers; to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. REED. Today, I am joined by 
Senators WARREN, BROWN, VAN HOL-
LEN, and GILLIBRAND to introduce legis-
lation to ensure that at least one Fed-
eral 
Reserve 
Governor 
has 
dem-
onstrated primary experience in sup-
porting or protecting the rights of 
workers. 
Our legislation is not the first to re-
quire a member of the Federal Reserve 
Board of Governors to have a par-
ticular area of expertise. Indeed, as 
part of the Terrorism Risk Insurance 
Program Reauthorization Act, which 
passed the Senate by a vote of 93–4 and 
was signed into law on January 12, 2015, 
Congress amended the Federal Reserve 
Act to require at least one of the seven 
Federal Reserve Governors to be an in-
dividual ‘‘with demonstrated primary 
experience working in or supervising 
community banks.’’ Our legislation 
would ensure that workers get the very 
same representation that community 
bankers already have on the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem. 
As we all are aware, the Federal Re-
serve has a dual mandate of stable 
prices and maximum employment. Our 
bill is designed to better ensure that 
future Boards of Governors continue 
the current Board’s focus on its full 
employment mandate as evidenced by 
its explicit acknowledgement last Au-
gust in its revised Statement on 
Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Pol-
icy Strategy that ‘‘maximum employ-
ment is a broad-based and inclusive 
goal.’’ This reflects the Fed’s ‘‘appre-
ciation for the benefits of a strong 
labor market, particularly for many in 
low-and 
moderate-income 
commu-
nities,’’ with policy decisions to be in-
formed by the Board’s ‘‘assessments of 
the shortfalls of employment from its 
maximum level’’ rather than by ‘‘devi-
ations from its maximum level’’ as in 
its previous statement. While this may 
not seem like a huge difference, it is 
reflective of the Board’s ‘‘view that a 
robust job market can be sustained 
without causing an outbreak of infla-
tion.’’ 
To put it more simply, this current 
Federal Reserve ‘‘will remain highly 
focused on fostering as strong a labor 
market as possible for the benefit of all 
Americans,’’ and our legislation seeks 
to ensure that future Federal Reserve 
Boards will continue to do the same. 
COVID–19 has shown us just how es-
sential workers are to our economy 
and our physical well-being. We all 
know grocery store workers, nurses, 
firefighters, 
delivery 
workers, 
and 
other workers in both the public and 
private sectors who, despite the risk to 
their own health, have been literally 
holding together the fabric of our soci-
ety and economy so that we can make 
it safely to the other side of this public 
health emergency. As such, they too 
deserve at least one member of the 
Board of Governors with demonstrated 
primary experience in supporting or 
protecting the rights of workers. I 
thank the AFL–CIO, Columbia Univer-
sity Professor and Nobel Laureate Jo-
seph 
Stiglitz, 
MIT 
Professor 
and 
Former International Monetary Fund 
Chief Economist Simon Johnson, and 
Georgetown 
Law 
Professor 
Adam 
Levitin for their support. and urge our 
colleagues to join in pushing to enact 
this legislation. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself and 
Ms. SINEMA): 
S. 1475. A bill to amend the Clean Air 
Act to prohibit the issuance of permits 
under title V of that Act for certain 
emissions from agricultural produc-
tion; to the Committee on Environ-
ment and Public Works. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 1475 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Livestock 
Regulatory Protection Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON PERMITTING CERTAIN 
EMISSIONS 
FROM 
AGRICULTURAL 
PRODUCTION. 
Section 502(f) of the Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7661a(f)) is amended— 
(1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through 
(3) as clauses (i) through (iii), respectively, 
and indenting appropriately; 
(2) in the undesignated matter following 
clause (iii) (as so redesignated), by striking 
‘‘Approval of’’ and inserting the following: 
‘‘(B) NO RELIEF OF OBLIGATION.—Approval 
of’’; 
(3) by striking the subsection designation 
and heading and all that follows through ‘‘No 
partial’’ in the matter preceding clause (i) 
(as so redesignated) and inserting the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(f) PROHIBITIONS.— 
‘‘(1) PARTIAL PERMIT PROGRAMS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—No partial’’; and 
(4) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(2) CERTAIN EMISSIONS FROM AGRICULTURAL 
PRODUCTION.—No 
permit 
shall 
be 
issued 
under a permit program under this title for 
any carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, water 
vapor, or methane emissions resulting from 
biological processes associated with live-
stock production.’’. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
week, the junior Senator from Massa-
chusetts and the Congresswoman from 
the 14th District of New York reintro-
duced their Green New Deal resolution. 
I think most Americans remember this 
socialist fantasy from when these 
Members introduced it 2 years ago. It 
would be hard to forget a proposal with 
that pricetag. There was one think 
tank that analyzed the initial proposal 
and released a first estimate that found 
that the Green New Deal would cost be-
tween $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 
10 years. Let me just repeat that—be-
tween $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 
10 years. 
To put that number in perspective, 
our entire Federal budget in 2019—our 
entire Federal budget—was well under 
$5 trillion. It would be interesting to 
learn where we are going to get that 
kind of money. A massive tax hike on 
the rich wouldn’t get us close to paying 
for this, but I don’t think I am the only 
one who isn’t sure where we would get 
the money for this. I don’t think the 
plan’s authors have a very clear idea of 
that either. In fact, the entire Green 
New Deal resolution is notable for its 
complete lack of specificity. 
It proposes outlandish, impossible 
goals, like upgrading every single 
building in the United States—every 
single building—in the next 10 years for 
maximum energy and water efficiency, 
as well as comfort, but it offers zero— 
zero—specifics for how we might actu-
ally accomplish them. I am not sur-
prised, because there is no way to come 
close to accomplishing everything the 
Green New Deal’s authors want to ac-
complish over the next decade without 
enormous economic pain. 
So often, when hearing the policies of 
the far left, environmental and other-
wise, I am struck by how they leave 
people out of the equation. Now, of 
course, the individuals proposing these 
plans don’t think they are leaving peo-
ple out of the equation. The Green New 
Deal’s authors are clearly under the 
impression that they are creating a 
paradise for American families—if par-
adise includes the government super-
vision and administration of just about 
every aspect of American life. Yet the 
reality is that, like so many utopian 
plans, most of the environmental left’s 
sweeping ideas for remaking our soci-
ety would have nightmarish effects in 
practice: higher energy costs, reduced 
economic growth, sharp increases in 
the cost of essential commodities like 
groceries, huge tax hikes, and job 
losses. 
Today, I want to talk about just one 
example of the damaging potential of 
environmental extremism, which has 
relevance for a bill I am introducing 
today. 
There has been an increasing tend-
ency on the part of the environmental 
left to demonize the consumption of 
beef, and this tendency is creeping into 
the mainstream. Earlier this week, 
food website Epicurious—a site a lot of 
Americans turn to when they are won-
dering what to cook for dinner—an-
nounced that it will no longer add new 
recipes featuring beef. The website said 
its move is not anti-beef but pro-plan-
et. It is pretty much wrong on both 
counts. 
First of all, the move to demonize 
beef could have real consequences for a 
lot of ranchers, like those I represent 
in South Dakota. If the demand for 
beef drops, some of these ranchers may 
be out of a job. Of course, the Green 
New Deal’s authors would probably 
suggest a government program to help

them out, but I can’t think of many 
ranchers I know who would like to 
abandon their way of life for their de-
pendence on a government program, 
and there is no reason they should have 
to. 
Contrary to the story being pushed 
by the environmental left, beef produc-
tion is directly responsible for only a 
tiny fraction of U.S. emissions, and 
beef cattle actually plays an important 
role in managing pasturelands that se-
quester vast amounts of carbon. On top 
of that, it has become clear that, with 
certain feed additives, it is possible to 
significantly reduce cattle emissions, 
making the demonization of beef even 
more wrong-headed. 
Today, I am introducing the Live-
stock Regulatory Protection Act with 
my colleague Senator SINEMA. I actu-
ally introduced this bill years ago with 
the Democratic leader, before it be-
came dangerous for Members of the 
Democratic leadership to support any-
thing that might anger the environ-
mental left. The Livestock Regulatory 
Protection Act is simple. It would pre-
vent the Environmental Protection 
Agency from imposing emissions regu-
lations relating to the biological proc-
esses of livestock. 
We really shouldn’t need this bill, 
but it is becoming increasingly clear 
that we do. This legislation was in-
cluded in annual funding bills on a bi-
partisan basis for a number of years 
after the Democratic leader and I first 
introduced it, but the House has omit-
ted it from its recent bills, and the 
Senate has had to secure its inclusion 
in the final bills. Passing this legisla-
tion would give livestock producers 
long-term certainty that their liveli-
hoods will not be compromised by over-
zealous environmental crusaders. 
I believe very strongly in protecting 
our environment. I have been an out-
doorsman all my life. In many ways, 
outdoors men and women are the origi-
nal environmentalists. If you value 
spending time in the outdoors—wheth-
er you are hunting or hiking, fishing or 
swimming—it is likely you are going to 
care a lot about keeping our air and 
water clean, preserving native species, 
and 
safeguarding 
our 
natural 
re-
sources. 
I have been interested in clean en-
ergy issues for a long time and have 
been introducing legislation to support 
clean energy development for more 
than a decade. In February, I intro-
duced two bipartisan bills to support 
the increased use of biofuels and to em-
phasize their clean energy potential. 
Currently, the EPA’s modeling does 
not fully recognize the tremendous 
emissions-reducing potential of eth-
anol and other biofuels. 
The Adopt GREET Act, which I in-
troduced 
with 
Senator 
KLOBUCHAR, 
would fix this problem and pave the 
way for increased biofuel use both here 
and abroad by requiring the Environ-
mental Protection Agency to update 
its greenhouse gas modeling for eth-
anol and biodiesel using the U.S. De-
partment of Energy’s GREET model. 
I also introduced a bill to advance 
long-stalled biofuel registrations at the 
EPA. Regulatory inaction has stifled 
the advancement of promising tech-
nologies, like ethanol derived from 
corn kernel fiber, even though some of 
these fuels are already being safely 
used in States like California. 
My bill would speed up the approval 
process for these innovative biofuels. 
This would allow biofuel producers to 
capitalize on the research and facility 
investments they have made and im-
prove their operating margins while 
further lowering emissions and helping 
our Nation’s corn and soybean pro-
ducers by reinforcing this essential 
market. 
Just last week, I joined colleagues 
from both parties to cosponsor the 
Growing Climate Solutions Act, which 
is legislation to make it easier for agri-
culture producers and foresters to par-
ticipate in carbon markets. This bill is 
a great example of the kind of bipar-
tisan process we should be following 
when it comes to climate legislation. 
So, as I said, I strongly believe in 
protecting our environment, but I be-
lieve that we need to protect our envi-
ronment in a way that takes account 
of people, too. That means promoting 
legislation that is good for our environ-
ment and for our economy, that is good 
for our environment and good for agri-
culture producers, and that is good for 
our environment and good for Amer-
ican families. 
That is why I have introduced pro-
posals like the Soil Health and Income 
Protection Program, or SHIPP. This 
program, a short-term version of the 
Conservation Reserve Program, is a 
win for both our environment and for 
farmers and ranchers. SHIPP, which 
became law as part of the 2018 farm 
bill, provides an incentive for farmers 
to take their lowest performing crop-
land out of production for 3 to 5 years. 
Like the Conservation Reserve Pro-
gram, it protects our environment by 
improving soil health and water qual-
ity while improving the bottom line for 
farmers. 
(The remarks of Mr. THUNE
per-
taining to the introduction of S. 1458 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. GRAHAM): 
S. 1495. A bill to promote inter-
national press freedom, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. A vibrant 
and independent media and public ac-
cess to accurate information are crit-
ical to the functioning of any democ-
racy. A free press is so important that 
our Founding Fathers explicitly guar-
anteed that right in the First Amend-
ment of our Constitution, and the 
United Nations defined press freedom 
as a fundamental human right in the 
Universal 
Declaration 
of 
Human 
Rights. 
But 
today—as 
democracies 
worldwide are facing growing chal-
lenges from authoritarian leaders, cen-
sorship, 
and 
disinformation 
cam-
paigns—foreign journalists are facing 
unprecedented dangers that put their 
profession, and their lives, at risk. 
The nature of threats against jour-
nalists is shifting. While the number of 
journalists killed in war zones con-
tinues to drop, the number of journal-
ists killed or targeted in countries at 
peace continues at historically high 
levels. Fifty journalists were killed be-
cause of their work in 2020, and 68% of 
these deaths occurred outside of con-
flict zones. Most of those who per-
petrate attacks are never held account-
able. Worldwide, there was complete 
impunity in 86% of cases of murdered 
journalists 
occurring 
between 
Sep-
tember 2019 and August 2020. In addi-
tion, the number of journalists impris-
oned remains at historically high lev-
els, with nearly 400 behind bars as of 
December 2020. And authoritarian gov-
ernments are using the COVID–19 pan-
demic as a pretext for censorship, re-
stricting reporters’ freedom of move-
ment, and harassing them. 
The legislation I am introducing 
today with Senator GRAHAM
marks 
World Press Freedom Day by honoring 
journalists not only with words but 
with action. It builds on the Daniel 
Pearl Freedom of the Press Act, signed 
into law in 2009, to take concrete steps 
to ensure the wellbeing of journalism 
as a profession, and of individual jour-
nalists themselves. This legislation 
creates a new fund for programs to help 
keep foreign journalists safe, whether 
they are operating in dangerous envi-
ronments or need to be re-located for 
their safety, and authorizes $30 million 
for this purpose. It uses existing fund-
ing to help nations prevent, inves-
tigate, and prosecute crimes against 
journalists overseas. It creates a new 
non-immigrant visa category to allow 
journalists in danger to come to the 
United States. And it creates a Coordi-
nator for International Press Freedom 
at the State Department to serve as a 
focal point for advancing the right to 
freedom of the press and freedom of ex-
pression abroad. 
I am proud to join Senator GRAHAM 
in this effort to ensure that the free 
press that we value so highly in the 
United States is protected and pro-
moted around the world, and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to 
ensure that this legislation is swiftly 
considered by the Senate. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

businesses, protect health care work-
ers, and sustain our industries, invest-
ing in child welfare is imperative to 
supporting 
these 
efforts. 
The 
coronavirus pandemic has further high-
lighted that the development of a ro-
bust, well-trained, and stable child wel-
fare workforce is central to improving 
outcomes for children and families 
across the United States. The existence 
of such a workforce is essential to a 
child welfare agency’s ability to carry 
out the responsibilities with which 
they have been entrusted. Child welfare 
work has been shown to be physically 
and emotionally challenging, as dem-
onstrated by recent studies into the 
impact of secondary traumatic stress 
(STS) on child welfare professionals. 
The multitude of challenges inherent 
in child welfare work, combined with 
relatively low compensation and work 
benefits, make these careers difficult 
to sustain, resulting in high rates of 
turnover and professionals who are 
more susceptible to burnout and com-
passion fatigue. 
For the past 15 years, child welfare 
turnover rates have been estimated be-
tween 20 percent and 40 percent. In 
2017, Virginia reported a turnover rate 
of 30%, while Washington State re-
ported a turnover rate of 20% and Geor-
gia reported a turnover rate of 32%. 
These high rates of turnover detract 
from the quality of services delivered 
to children and families and result in 
an estimated cost of $54,000 per worker 
leaving an agency. 
More needs to be done to ensure that 
individuals pursuing careers in child 
welfare receive appropriate training 
and support to improve the sustain-
ability of their important, yet demand-
ing work. Maintaining a high-per-
forming, 
engaged, 
and 
committed 
workforce is vital to providing families 
with the quality supports they need to 
stabilize, reunify, and thrive. Research 
suggests that positive child welfare 
outcomes depend largely on the capac-
ity and competence of the child welfare 
workforce. 
This is why I am pleased to introduce 
today the Child Welfare Workforce 
Support Act with my colleague Sen-
ator BALDWIN. This bill directs the Sec-
retary to conduct a five-year dem-
onstration program for child welfare 
service providers to implement tar-
geted interventions to recruit, select, 
and retain child welfare workers. This 
demonstration program will focus on 
building an evidence base of best prac-
tices for reducing barriers to the re-
cruitment, development, and retention 
of individuals providing direct services 
to children and families. Funds will 
also be used to provide ongoing profes-
sional development to assist child wel-
fare workers in meeting the diverse 
needs of families with infants and chil-
dren with the goal of improving both 
the quality of services provided and the 
sustainability of such careers. Invest-
ing resources in determining what 
practices have the greatest impact on 
the successful recruitment and reten-
tion of child welfare workers will assist 
in developing an evidence-base for fu-
ture federal investment in this space. 
I hope that as the Senate considers 
reauthorizing the Child Abuse Preven-
tion and Treatment Act that we con-
sider the Child Welfare Workforce Sup-
port Act and recognize the vital role 
that child welfare workers play to im-
prove outcomes and protect our most 
vulnerable infants and children. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Ms. BALDWIN): 
S. 1497. A bill to amend the Child 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act 
to ensure protections for lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and queer youth 
and their families; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. According 
to the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS), lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, 
and 
queer 
(LGBTQ) youth are at an increased 
risk for experiencing maltreatment 
compared to non-LGBTQ youth. Be-
cause of limited exposure to mandated 
reporters as a result of the COVID–19 
pandemic, the unfortunate truth is 
that 
the 
maltreatment 
that 
some 
youth experience have experienced has 
gone unrecognized and underreported. 
Research prior to the pandemic dem-
onstrated that LGBTQ youth were 
more likely to experience physical 
abuse by a parent or guardian when 
compared to their heterosexual peers. 
Risk for harm of vulnerable youth also 
extends far beyond physical safety. 
LGBTQ youth are at a disproportion-
ately high risk for depression, suicidal 
ideation and suicide, and self-harming 
behaviors, with rates of attempted sui-
cide of around 2 to 10 times those of 
peers. 
These risks for maltreatment often 
times result in LGBTQ youth entering 
the child welfare system. Studies have 
found that, ‘‘LGBT young people are 
overrepresented in child welfare sys-
tems, despite the fact that they are 
likely to be underreported because 
they risk harassment and abuse if their 
LGBT identity is disclosed.’’ This over-
representation of LGBTQ youth in the 
foster care system raises concerns 
about issues in the child abuse and pre-
vention space. Additional research is 
needed to understand the risk of abuse 
among 
LGBTQ 
youth, 
particularly 
those identifying as transgender. This 
information will yield invaluable infor-
mation to be used in developing tar-
geted prevention strategies to reduce 
the rates of adverse childhood experi-
ences of LGBTQ individuals. 
This is why I am pleased to introduce 
the Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act with 
my colleague Senator BALDWIN. Our 
bill amends the Child Abuse Prevention 
and Treatment Act and calls for HHS 
and other federal agencies to carry out 
an interdisciplinary research program 
to protect LGBTQ youth from child 
abuse and neglect and improve the 
well-being of victims of child abuse or 
neglect. This legislation also expands 
current practices around demographic 
information collection and reporting 
on incidences and prevalence of child 
maltreatment to include sexual ori-
entation and gender identity. 
Additionally, the bill opens existing 
grant funding opportunities to invest 
in the training of personnel in best 
practices to meet the unique needs of 
LGBTQ youth and calls for the inclu-
sion 
of 
individuals 
experienced 
in 
working with LGBTQ youth and fami-
lies in state task forces. Improving 
data collection and disaggregation will 
provide greater insight into the cir-
cumstances LGBTQ youth face in the 
home that, when left unaddressed, lead 
to entry into the child welfare system. 
This 
improved 
data-driven 
under-
standing can then be used to develop 
appropriate and effective primary pre-
vention practices to decrease the risks 
faced by LGTBQ youth, and will be piv-
otal in our understanding of abuse and 
neglect following the pandemic. 
I hope that as the Senate moves to 
reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention 
and Treatment Act we consider the 
Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act to better 
inform our collective understanding of 
the risks faced by LGBTQ youth and 
the best ways to protect them.

S. 1500. A bill to permit Amtrak to 
bring civil actions in Federal district 
court to enforce the right set forth in 
section 24308(c) of title 49, United 
States Code, which gives intercity and 
commuter 
rail 
passenger 
transpor-
tation preference over freight transpor-
tation in using a rail line, junction, or 
crossing; to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 1500 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rail Pas-
senger Fairness Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
(1) Congress created Amtrak under the 
Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (Public 
Law 91–158). 
(2) Amtrak began serving customers on 
May 1, 1971, taking over the operation of 
most intercity passenger trains that private, 
freight railroads were previously required to 
operate. In exchange for assuming these pas-
senger rail operations, Amtrak was given ac-
cess to the national rail network. 
(3) In return for relief from the obligation 
to provide intercity passenger service, rail-
roads over which Amtrak operated (referred 
to in this section as ‘‘host railroads’’) were 
expected to give Amtrak passenger trains 
preference over freight trains when using the 
national rail network. 
(4) In 1973, Congress passed the Amtrak Im-
provement Act of 1973 (Public Law 93–146), 
which gives intercity and commuter rail pas-
senger transportation preference over freight

transportation in using a rail line, junction, 
or crossing. This right, which is now codified 
as section 24308(c) of title 49, United States 
Code, states, ‘‘Except in an emergency, 
intercity and commuter rail passenger trans-
portation provided by or for Amtrak has 
preference over freight transportation in 
using a rail line, junction, or crossing unless 
the Board orders otherwise under this sub-
section. A rail carrier affected by this sub-
section may apply to the Board for relief. If 
the Board, after an opportunity for a hearing 
under section 553 of title 5, decides that pref-
erence for intercity and commuter rail pas-
senger transportation materially will lessen 
the quality of freight transportation pro-
vided to shippers, the Board shall establish 
the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on rea-
sonable terms.’’. 
(5) Many host railroads have ignored the 
law referred to in paragraph (4) by refusing 
to give passenger rail the priority to which 
it is statutorily entitled and giving freight 
transportation the higher priority. As a re-
sult, Amtrak’s on time performance on most 
host railroads is poor, has declined between 
2014 through 2019, and continues to decline. 
(6) According to Amtrak, 6,500,000 cus-
tomers on State-supported and long-distance 
trains arrived at their destination late dur-
ing fiscal year 2019. Nearly 70 percent of 
these delays were caused by host railroads, 
amounting to a total of 3,200,000 minutes. 
The largest cause of these delays was freight 
train interference, which accounted for more 
than 1,000,000 minutes of delay for Amtrak 
passengers, or approximately 2 years, be-
cause host railroads chose to give freight 
trains priority. 
(7) Poor on-time performance wastes tax-
payer dollars. According to a 2019 report by 
Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General, a 5 
percent improvement of on-time perform-
ance on all Amtrak routes would result in 
$12,100,000 in cost savings to Amtrak in the 
first year. If on-time performance on long- 
distance routes reached 75 percent for a year, 
Amtrak 
would 
realize 
an 
estimated 
$41,900,000 in operating cost savings, with a 
one-time savings of $336,000,000 due to a re-
duction in equipment replacement needs. 
(8) Historical data suggests that on-time 
performance on host railroads is driven by 
the existence of an effective means to en-
force Amtrak’s preference rights: 
(A) Two months after the date of the en-
actment of the Passenger Rail Investment 
and Improvement Act of 2008 (division B of 
Public Law 110–432), which included provi-
sions for the enforcement of these preference 
rights, was enacted, the on-time performance 
of long-distance trains improved from 56 per-
cent to 77 percent and Class I freight train 
interference delays across all routes declined 
by 40 percent. 
(B) One year after such date of enactment, 
freight train interference delays had de-
clined by 54 percent and the on-time per-
formance of long-distance trains reached 85 
percent. 
(C) In 2014, after some of the provisions in 
the Passenger Rail Investment and Improve-
ment Act of 2008 related to enforcement of 
preference were ruled unconstitutional by a 
D.C. Circuit Court, long-distance train on- 
time performance declined from 72 percent 
to 50 percent, and freight train interference 
delays increased 59 percent. 
(D) The last time long-distance trains 
achieved an on-time rate of more than 80 
percent in a given month was February 2012. 
(9) As a result of violations of Amtrak’s 
right to preference, Amtrak has been con-
sistently unable on host railroad networks 
to meet its congressionally mandated mis-
sion and goals, which are codified in section 
24101 of title 49, United States Code (relating 
to providing on-time and trip-time competi-
tive service to its passengers). 
(10) Amtrak does not have an effective 
mechanism to enforce its statutory pref-
erence right in order to fulfill its mission 
and goals. Only the Attorney General can 
bring a civil action for equitable relief in a 
district court of the United States to enforce 
Amtrak’s preference rights. 
(11) In Amtrak’s entire history, the only 
enforcement action initiated by the Attor-
ney General was against the Southern Pa-
cific Transportation Company in 1979. 
(12) Congress supports continued authority 
for the Attorney General to initiate an ac-
tion, but Amtrak should also be entitled to 
bring a civil action before a Federal district 
court to enforce its statutory preference 
rights.

ACTION

ERENCE RIGHTS.

trator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency to promulgate certain limita-
tions with respect to pre-production 
plastic pellet pollution, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 1507 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited the ‘‘Plastic Pellet 
Free Waters Act’’. 
SEC. 2. EFFLUENT LIMITATIONS FOR WASTE-
WATER, SPILLS, AND RUNOFF FROM 
PLASTIC POLYMER PRODUCTION FA-
CILITIES, PLASTIC MOLDING AND 
FORMING FACILITIES, AND OTHER 
POINT SOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE TRANSPORT AND PACKAGING 
OF PLASTIC PELLETS OR OTHER 
PRE-PRODUCTION 
PLASTIC 
MATE-
RIALS. 
Not later than 60 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Administrator of 
the Environmental Protection Agency (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘Adminis-
trator’’) shall promulgate a final rule to en-
sure that— 
(1) the discharge of plastic pellets or other 
pre-production plastic materials (including 
discharge into wastewater and other runoff) 
from facilities regulated under part 414 or 463 
of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in 
effect on the date of enactment of this Act), 
is prohibited; 
(2) the discharge of plastic pellets or other 
pre-production plastic materials (including 
discharge into wastewater and other runoff) 
from a point source (as defined in section 502 
of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
(33 U.S.C. 1362)) that makes, uses, packages, 
or transports those plastic pellets and other 
pre-production plastic materials is prohib-
ited; and 
(3) the requirements under paragraphs (1) 
and (2) are reflected in— 
(A) all wastewater, stormwater, and other 
permits issued by the Administrator and 
State-delegated programs under section 402 
of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
(33 U.S.C. 1342) to facilities and other point 
sources (as defined in section 502 of that Act 
(33 U.S.C. 1362)) that make, use, package, or 
transport plastic pellets or other pre-produc-
tion plastic materials, as determined by the 
Administrator, in addition to other applica-
ble limits and standards; and 
(B) all standards of performance promul-
gated under section 312(p) of the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 
1322(p)) that are applicable to point sources 
(as defined in section 502 of that Act (33 
U.S.C. 1362)) that make, use, package, or 
transport plastic pellets or other pre-produc-

Administrator. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. 
MORAN, Mr. WARNER, Mr. CAS-
SIDY, Mr. CASEY, Mr. RUBIO, and 
Mr. MANCHIN): 
S. 1521. A bill to require certain civil 
penalties to be transferred to a fund 
through 
which 
amounts 
are 
made 
available for the Gabriella Miller Kids 
First Pediatric Research Program at 
the National Institutes of Health, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. While 
cancer is the leading cause of death by 
disease among children past infancy, 
childhood cancer and other rare pedi-
atric diseases remain poorly under-
stood. According to the National Can-
cer Institute, an estimated 15,590 chil-
dren and adolescents under the age of 
19 will be diagnosed with cancer, and 
1,780 will die of the disease in the 
United States in 2021. 
This is why I am pleased to be intro-
ducing the Gabriella Miller Kids First 
Research Act 2.0 with Senators JERRY 
MORAN, MARK R. WARNER, and BILL 
CASSIDY. The legislation provides a new 
source of funding for the National In-
stitutes of Health’s (NIH) Gabriella 
Miller Kids First Pediatric Research 
Program (Kids First) by redirecting 
penalties 
collected 
from 
pharma-
ceutical, cosmetic, supplement, and 
medical device companies that break 
the law to pediatric and childhood can-
cer research. The bill is named in 
honor of Gabriella Miller, a Leesburg, 
Virginia resident who died from a rare 
form of brain cancer at the age of 10. 
Gabriella was an activist and worked 
to raise support for research into child-
hood diseases like cancer until her 
death in October of 2013. 
The Gabriella Miller Kids First Re-
search Program has supported critical 
research into pediatric cancer and 
structural birth defects and has fo-
cused on building a pediatric data re-
source combining genetic sequencing 
data with clinical data from multiple 
pediatric cohorts. The Gabriella Miller 
Kids First Data Resource Center is 
helping to advance scientific under-
standing and discoveries around pedi-
atric cancer and structural birth de-
fects and has sequenced nearly 20,000 
samples thus far. While Congress has 
appropriated $12.6 million for the Kids 
First program annually since Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2015, this legislation would 
make additional funding streams avail-
able to appropriators to further sup-
port pediatric and childhood cancer re-
search. 
Gabriella Miller was a passionate ac-
tivist and fighter. In 2014, I was a 
strong champion of the Gabriella Mil-
ler Kids First Research Act, which es-
tablished the Ten-Year Pediatric Re-
search Initiative at the NIH and au-
thorized $12.6 million per fiscal year 
through FY23. We honor Gabriella’s 
memory by continuing her work in 
making sure pediatric disease research 
is a priority. This bipartisan legisla-
tion would provide a critical source of 
funding to improve research in pedi-
atric cancer and diseases, and I urge 
my colleagues to support it.’

NIZING 50 YEARS OF SERVICE BY 
THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PAS-

MONLY KNOWN AS AMTRAK 
Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. 
WICKER, Mr. PETERS, Mrs. FISCHER, Mr. 
TESTER, Mr. MORAN, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. 
LUJA´ N, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Ms. BALDWIN, 
and Ms. KLOBUCHAR) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to 
the 
Committee 
on 
Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation: 
S. RES. 190 
Whereas, on October 30, 1970, Congress en-
acted the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 
(Public Law 91–518; 84 Stat. 1327), which cre-
ated the National Railroad Passenger Cor-
poration (commonly known and referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘Amtrak’’) to assume 
the responsibility of providing the United 
States with nationwide passenger rail serv-
ice, which began on May 1, 1971; 
Whereas May 1, 2021, marks 50 years since 
the date Amtrak began providing passenger 
rail service to individuals in the United 
States; 
Whereas Amtrak connects over 500 commu-
nities across 46 States, the District of Co-
lumbia, and 3 Canadian Provinces; 
Whereas, in 2019, Amtrak provided over 
32,000,000 trips, the highest yearly ridership 
in its history; 
Whereas the total annual economic impact 
of Amtrak and the passengers it serves 
across 
the 
United 
States 
exceeds 
$8,000,000,000; 
Whereas Amtrak has formed valuable part-
nerships with 17 States to operate 28 region-
alized routes, which resulted in 15,400,000 
trips in 2019; 
Whereas Amtrak operates 15 long-distance 
routes that resulted in 4,600,000 trips in 2019; 
Whereas the Acela and the Northeast Re-
gional, 2 services of Amtrak along the North-
east Corridor, provided 12,500,000 trips in 
2019; and 
Whereas Amtrak provides a number of es-
sential services and public benefits, which 
include— 
(1) serving as the only source of public 
transportation in many rural communities; 
(2) employing approximately 16,000 people 
and supporting tens of thousands of addi-
tional jobs in the communities it serves; and 
(3) because Amtrak is 47 percent more en-
ergy efficient than car travel and 33 percent 
more energy efficient than air travel (as 
measured by passenger miles), providing an 
environmentally friendly way to travel: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes— 
(1) 50 years of service by the National Rail-
road 
Passenger 
Corporation 
(commonly 
known and referred to in this resolution as 
‘‘Amtrak’’); 
(2) the need for safe and affordable national 
passenger rail service in the United States; 
(3) that Amtrak provides a vital connec-
tion for both urban and rural communities 
throughout the United States and, in the 
process, contributes to the economic growth 
of those communities; and 
(4) that the restoration and expansion of 
the services that Amtrak provides is in the 
interest of the United States.

(for 
himself, 
Mrs.

Ms. 
CANTWELL, 
and 
Mr. 
WICKER) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation.: 
S. RES. 191 
Whereas, each year, the underground util-
ity infrastructure of the United States, in-
cluding 
pipelines, 
electric, 
gas, 
tele-
communications, water, sewer, and cable tel-
evision lines, is jeopardized by unintentional 
damage caused by those who fail to locate 
underground utility lines prior to digging; 
Whereas some utility lines are buried only 
a few inches underground, making the lines 
easy to strike, even during shallow digging 
projects; 
Whereas digging prior to locating under-
ground utility lines often results in unin-
tended consequences, such as service inter-
ruption, environmental damage, personal in-
jury, and even death; 
Whereas the month of April marks the be-
ginning of the peak period during which ex-
cavation projects are carried out around the 
United States; 
Whereas, in 2002, Congress required the De-
partment of Transportation and the Federal 
Communications Commission to establish a 
3-digit, nationwide, toll-free number to be 
used by State ‘‘One Call’’ systems to provide 
information on underground utility lines; 
Whereas, in 2005, the Federal Communica-
tions Commission designated ‘‘811’’ as the 
nationwide ‘‘One Call’’ number for home-
owners and excavators to use to obtain infor-
mation on underground utility lines before 
conducting excavation activities; 
Whereas the 1,700 members of the Common 
Ground Alliance, who are dedicated to ensur-
ing public safety, environmental protection, 
and the integrity of services, promote the 
national ‘‘Call Before You Dig’’ campaign to 
increase public awareness about the impor-
tance of homeowners and excavators calling 
811 to find out the exact location of under-
ground utility lines; 
Whereas the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory 
Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pub-
lic Law 112–90; 125 Stat. 1904) affirmed and 
expanded the ‘‘One Call’’ program by elimi-
nating exemptions given to local and State 
government agencies and their contractors 
regarding notifying ‘‘One Call’’ centers be-
fore digging; 
Whereas, according to the Common Ground 
Alliance’s 2019 Damage Information Report-
ing Tool (DIRT) Report published in October 
2020, there were an estimated 532,000 in-
stances of excavation-related damage to un-
derground facilities in the United States dur-
ing 2019, a 4.5 percent increase from the Com-
mon Ground Alliance’s 2018 estimate; 
Whereas the Common Ground Alliance con-
ducted a survey in 2020 and found that 50 per-
cent of the more than 1,800 respondents were 
aware of 811, the highest level since the sur-
vey was first conducted in 2008; 
Whereas the Common Ground Alliance es-
timated that the societal costs of exca-
vation-related damage to buried utilities 
were $30,000,000,000 in 2019, including costs for 
facility repair, property damage, medical 
bills, and costs to the surrounding businesses 
affected by the resulting utility outages; and 
Whereas the Common Ground Alliance has 
designated April as ‘‘National Safe Digging 
Month’’ to increase awareness of safe digging 
practices across the United States and to 
celebrate the anniversary of 811, the national 
‘‘Call Before You Dig’’ number: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Safe Digging Month; 
(2) encourages all homeowners and exca-
vators throughout the United States to call 
811 before digging; and 
(3) 
encourages 
all 
damage 
prevention 
stakeholders to help educate homeowners 
and excavators throughout the United States 
about the importance of calling 811 before 
digging.

cents aged 13 to 18 years old will experience 
some form of a mental disorder; 
Whereas, in 2019, over 11 percent of chil-
dren ages 3 to 17 years old received treat-
ment or counseling from a mental health 
professional, according to the United States 
Census Bureau; 
Whereas suicide is the third leading cause 
of death for youth ages 10 to 24 years old, and 
90 percent of those individuals have an un-
derlying mental illness; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
increased isolation and collective trauma 
have led to an increase in demand for mental 
health services for children, with the propor-
tion of mental health–related visits to emer-
gency rooms for children increasing from ap-
proximately 24 to 31 percent between 2019 
and 2020; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has also 
laid bare the inequities in our mental health 
delivery system for all populations, and such 
inequities have disproportionately impacted 
children and adults who have been exposed 
to adverse childhood experiences prior to and 
during the pandemic; and 
Whereas the stigma of accessing mental 
and behavioral health services persisted be-
fore the COVID–19 pandemic, and acknowl-
edging this public health crisis and creating 
awareness as early as possible is as impor-
tant as ever: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of the week of 
May 2, 2021, as ‘‘Children’s Mental Health 
Awareness Week’’ and the day of May 9, 2021, 
as ‘‘Children’s Mental Health Awareness 
Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the importance of con-
necting children with appropriate mental 
and behavioral health services and supports; 
(3) seeks to create awareness regarding the 
additional challenges children and their fam-
ilies have faced during the COVID–19 pan-
demic due to isolation from family and 
peers, exposure to traumas, and barriers to 
mental and behavioral health services and 
supports; 
(4) supports programs and services aimed 
at expanding access to care, building resil-
iency, and addressing trauma; and 
(5) appreciates and extends its gratitude to 
family members, friends, educators, mental 
and behavioral health service providers, and 
others in their support for children’s mental 
health and well-being.

BRATING THE 149TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF ARBOR DAY 
Mr. KING (for himself, Mr. RISCH, 
Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. BRAUN, Ms. BALD-
WIN, Mr. CRAPO, Ms. SMITH, Mr. BOOZ-
MAN, Mr. MANCHIN, Ms. COLLINS, Mrs. 
MURRAY, and Mr. WICKER) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 194 
Whereas Arbor Day was founded on April 
10, 1872, to recognize the importance of 
planting trees; 
Whereas Arbor Day is a time to recognize 
the importance of trees and an opportunity 
for communities to gather and plant for a 
greener future; 
Whereas Arbor Day is observed in all 50 
States and across the world; 
Whereas participating in Arbor Day activi-
ties promotes civic participation and high-
lights the importance of planting and caring 
for trees and vegetation; 
Whereas such activities provide an oppor-
tunity to convey to future generations the 
value of land and stewardship; 
Whereas working forests have contributed 
to an increase in the number of trees planted 
in the United States and are sustainably 
managed, with less than 2 percent of working 
forests nationally harvested each year; 
Whereas a key factor in preventing forest 
conversion and deforestation is keeping for-
ests productive; 
Whereas working forests are a critical part 
of a nature-based solution to climate change, 
and by providing a continuous cycle of grow-
ing, harvesting, and replanting, active forest 
management maximizes the ability to se-
quester and store carbon and improves forest 
resilience; 
Whereas private forests play an important 
role in conserving at-risk and declining spe-
cies, and collaborative conservation efforts 
can benefit species while also helping to 
keep forests as forests; 
Whereas sustainably grown wood can be 
used in a wide variety of resilient infrastruc-
ture and building applications—from tradi-
tional timber framing to high-tech bridges 
to high-rise buildings made of mass timber— 
and as a natural, renewable, and biodegrad-
able material, substituting wood for other 
materials in buildings and bridges could sig-
nificantly decrease global carbon emissions; 
Whereas the Arbor Day Foundation and 
the Tree City USA program have been com-
mitted to greening cities and towns across 
the country since 1976, and in that time, 
more than 3,400 communities have made the 
commitment to becoming a Tree City USA; 
Whereas Tree City USA communities are 
home to more than 143,000,000 people in the 
United States who are dedicated to core 
standards of sound urban forestry manage-
ment and who dedicate resources and time to 
urban forestry initiatives, which helps make 
their communities and our country a better 
place to live; 
Whereas National Arbor Day is observed on 
the last Friday of April each year; and 
Whereas April 30, 2021, marks the 149th an-
niversary of Arbor Day: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes April 30, 2021, as ‘‘National 
Arbor Day’’; 
(2) celebrates the 149th anniversary of 
Arbor Day; 
(3) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Arbor Day; and 
(4) encourages the people of United States 
to participate in National Arbor Day activi-
ties.

NIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE MCCLELLAN-KERR AR-
KANSAS 
RIVER 
NAVIGATION 
SYSTEM 
Mr. 
INHOFE 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
LANKFORD, Mr. BOOZMAN, and Mr. COT-
TON) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Environment and Public 
Works: 
S. RES. 195 
Whereas June 5, 2021, marks the 50th anni-
versary of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas 
River Navigation System (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘MKARNS’’); 
Whereas, in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 
1946 (Public Law 79–525), Congress authorized 
the Army Corps of Engineers (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Corps’’) to undertake com-
prehensive improvements on the Arkansas 
and Verdigris Rivers, which served as the 
foundation of the MKARNS; 
Whereas the MKARNS opened for full use 
in December 1970, which, after over 20 years 
and $1,200,000,000, was the largest civil works 
project undertaken by the Corps at the time; 
Whereas President Richard M. Nixon offi-
cially dedicated the MKARNS on June 5, 
1971, at a ceremony at the Tulsa Port of 
Catoosa, Oklahoma; 
Whereas the MKARNS is named for United 
States Senator John L. McClellan of Arkan-
sas and former Oklahoma Governor and 
United States Senator Robert S. Kerr of 
Oklahoma, who advocated for the creation of 
an expansive, inland waterway system; 
Whereas the MKARNS is 445 river miles 
long, with 18 locks and dams, spans from 
Catoosa, Oklahoma, to the Mississippi River, 
and serves commerce from a 12-State region 
consisting of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, 
Texas, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Min-
nesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Mis-
souri, and Idaho; 
Whereas 
the 
MKARNS 
provides 
year- 
round, accessible inland waterway transpor-
tation to 5 public ports, 50 private port ter-
minals, and over 90 industries; 
Whereas, on an annual basis, the MKARNS 
provides for $8,500,000,000 in sales impacts,

April 29, 2021 
$1,600,000,000 in transportation cost savings, 
and $289,000,000 in business taxes; 
Whereas the MKARNS contributes to 56,000 
full- and part-time jobs, and 20 percent of all 
jobs in the United States are linked to wa-
terborne commerce supported by the inland 
waterway system; 
Whereas, on average, 11,000,000 tons of com-
modities 
with 
a 
value 
upwards 
of 
$4,000,000,000 travels on the MKARNS annu-
ally, with sand, gravel, rock, chemical fer-
tilizer, iron, and steel accounting for nearly 
60 percent of all waterborne commerce; 
Whereas there are 4 designated Foreign- 
Trade Zones along the navigation system at 
the public ports at Catoosa, Muskogee, Lit-
tle Rock, and Pine Bluff; 
Whereas the MKARNS allows for the low-
est-cost and most environmentally friendly 
method of moving goods, with 1 barge trans-
porting the equivalent of 15 jumbo railcars 
and 60 large semi-trailers; 
Whereas, in 2015, the Corps upgraded the 
classification of the MKARNS from ‘‘Con-
nector’’ to ‘‘Corridor’’ on the National Ma-
rine Highway, designated the MKARNS as a 
high-use waterway system, and labeled the 
MKARNS as Marine Highway 40; 
Whereas Congress authorized multiple uses 
for the MKARNS, including navigation, flood 
control, hydropower, recreation, water sup-
ply, and wildlife conservation; 
Whereas, through the end of 2020, Arkansas 
River 
Basin 
projects, 
including 
the 
MKARNS, are estimated to have cumula-
tively prevented nearly $16,000,000,000 in 
flood damages in the Arkansas River Basin 
region; 
Whereas there are 15 hydropower plants on 
the MKARNS which provide low-cost power 
to 7,000,000 people and produce 2,500,000 kilo- 
watt-hours per year; 
Whereas inland waterways provide many 
recreational opportunities, such as fishing, 
boating, and hiking, and over 4,000 rec-
reational vessels lock through the MKARNS 
and 5,400,000 people visit Corps-operated 
recreation areas along the MKARNS annu-
ally; 
Whereas modernization of the MKARNS 
will empower future economic development, 
promote freight mobility, expand agricul-
tural exports and oil and gas development, 
and relieve congestion on our roads and 
bridges; 
Whereas the increased backlog in critical 
maintenance causes the economic uncer-
tainty of complete navigation disruption on 
the MKARNS, which would cost beneficiaries 
up to $2,000,000 per day; 
Whereas Congress authorized the MKARNS 
to be deepened to 12 feet in 2003, and approxi-
mately 90 percent of the MKARNS is already 
12-feet deep; 
Whereas the capacity of each barge could 
be increased by 200 tons for each additional 
foot of draft, increasing the overall freight 
capacity of the MKARNS by 40 percent and 
resulting in over $250,000,000 in increased 
business sales annually; and 
Whereas Oklahoma, Arkansas, the sur-
rounding region, and the entire Nation have 
benefitted, and will continue to benefit, 
greatly from the MKARNS: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors 2021 as the 50th anniversary of 
the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Naviga-
tion System; 
(2) recognizes that investments in inland 
waterway navigation infrastructure are an 
investment in the long-term strength and se-
curity of the United States economy; and 
(3) commits to completing the deepening of 
the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Naviga-
tion System from 9 feet to 12 feet.

himself, 
Mr. 
TESTER, Mr. CRAMER, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. 
LANKFORD, Mr. LUJA´ N, Mr. SCHATZ, Ms. 
MURKOWSKI, and Mr. CRAPO) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 196 
Whereas, according to a study commis-
sioned by the Department of Justice, in some 
Tribal 
communities, 
American 
Indian 
women face murder rates that are more than 
10 times the national average murder rate; 
Whereas, according to the most recently 
available data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, in 2017, homicide 
was the sixth leading cause of death for 
American Indian and Alaska Native females 
between 1 and 44 years of age; 
Whereas little data exist on the number of 
missing American Indian, Alaska Native, 
and Native Hawaiian women in the United 
States; 
Whereas, on July 5, 2013, Hanna Harris, a 
member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, 
was reported missing by her family in Lame 
Deer, Montana; 
Whereas the body of Hanna Harris was 
found 5 days after she went missing; 
Whereas Hanna Harris was determined to 
have been raped and murdered, and the indi-
viduals accused of committing those crimes 
were convicted; 
Whereas the case of Hanna Harris is an ex-
ample of many similar cases; and 
Whereas Hanna Harris was born on May 5, 
1992: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 5, 2021, as the ‘‘National 
Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered 
Native Women and Girls’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
and interested groups— 
(A) to commemorate the lives of missing 
and murdered American Indian, Alaska Na-
tive, and Native Hawaiian women whose 
cases are documented and undocumented in 
public records and the media; and 
(B) to demonstrate solidarity with the

the sacrifices made by the wounded and ill 
members of the Armed Forces; 
Whereas the Silver Star Service Banner 
has come to represent the members of the 
Armed Forces and veterans who were wound-
ed or became ill in combat in the wars

Whereas the Silver Star Families of Amer-
ica was formed to help the people of the 
United States remember the sacrifices made 
by the wounded and ill members of the 
Armed Forces by designing and manufac-
turing Silver Star Service Banners and Sil-
ver Star Flags for that purpose; 
Whereas the sole mission of the Silver Star 
Families of America is to evoke memories of 
the sacrifices made by members of the 
Armed Forces and veterans on behalf of the 
United States through the presence of a Sil-
ver Star Service Banner in a window or a Sil-
ver Star Flag flying; 
Whereas the sacrifices made by members of 
the Armed Forces and veterans on behalf of 
the United States should never be forgotten;

Whereas the people of the United States

hate crimes and violence against Asian 
American and Pacific Islanders; 
Whereas between March 19, 2020, and Feb-
ruary 28, 2021, there have been 3,795 firsthand 
accounts of anti-Asian and Pacific Islander 
hate incidents and crimes reported from all

dents took place at a business and more than 
2,000,000 Asian American and Pacific Islander 
businesses have contributed to the diverse 
fabric of American life; 
Whereas during this time, Asian American 
and Pacific Islander youth under 20 years old 
make up approximately 13 percent of vic-

commitment to conduct a 30-day review of 
violence against Asian Americans and Pa-
cific Islanders, which will seek to improve 
the Federal Government’s capacity to track

forcement authorities, and assess whether 
additional money is needed to support law 
enforcement’s response to the surge in vio-
lence; and 
(5) calls on Federal law enforcement offi-
cials, working with State and local offi-

SENATE RESOLUTION 201—AMEND-
ING THE STANDING RULES OF 
THE SENATE TO ENABLE THE 
PARTICIPATION OF ABSENT SEN-
ATORS DURING A NATIONAL CRI-
SIS 
Mr. PORTMAN (for himself, Mr. DUR-
BIN, Ms. WARREN, Mr. SANDERS, Mr. 
KING, and Mr. SCHATZ) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Rules and 
Administration: 
S. RES. 201 
Resolved, 
SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF ABSENT SEN-
ATORS DURING A NATIONAL CRISIS. 
Rule XII of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘5. Senators may use technology that has 
been approved by the Secretary of the Sen-
ate and the Sergeant at Arms and Door-
keeper of the Senate as reliable and secure 
to cast their votes from outside of the Sen-
ate Chamber if the majority leader or his or 
her designee and the minority leader or his 
or her designee jointly determine that an ex-
traordinary crisis of national extent exists 
in which it would be infeasible for Senators 
to cast their votes in person. If such a crisis 
is determined to exist, Senators may cast 
votes under this paragraph during the 30-day 
period beginning on the date on which such 
determination is made, unless such period is 
extended for one or more additional 30-day 
periods by an affirmative vote of three-fifths 
of the Senators duly chosen and sworn. Dur-
ing such period, Senators participating re-
motely and using approved technology to 
cast their votes under this paragraph shall 
be deemed present for purposes of estab-
lishing the presence of a quorum. The deter-
mination made under this paragraph shall 
not rely on any decision of any other branch 
of the United States Government. The ma-
jority leader or his or her designee and the 
minority leader or his or her designee shall 
submit at the beginning of the first session 
of each Congress an order for designees of 
each caucus in the case of such a crisis.’’.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE MEN

OR ARE PRESENTLY SERVING, 
IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE OF 
THE UNITED STATES, AND HON-
ORING THE MEMBERS OF THE 
FOREIGN 
SERVICE 
WHO

HOLLEN, Mr. DURBIN, Ms. COLLINS, Mrs. 
SHAHEEN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. BOOKER, 
Mr. KAINE, Mr. CARDIN, and Mr. COONS) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 202 
Whereas the Foreign Service of the United 
States (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Foreign Service’’) was established through 
the enactment of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act 
for the reorganization and improvement of 
the Foreign Service of the United States, 
and for other purposes.’’, approved May 24, 
1924 (43 Stat. 140, chapter 182) (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Rogers Act of 1924’’), and is 
now celebrating its 97th anniversary; 
Whereas the Rogers Act of 1924 established 
a career organization based on competitive 
examination and merit promotion; 
Whereas, in 2021, just less than 16,000 men 
and women of the Foreign Service are serv-
ing at home and abroad; 
Whereas Foreign Service personnel are 
supported by more than 60,000 locally en-
gaged staff in nearly 300 embassies and con-
sulates, who provide unique expertise and 
crucial links to host countries; 
Whereas Foreign Service personnel com-
prise employees from the Department of 
State, the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, the Department of 
Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, and the United States Agency for 
Global Media; 
Whereas the diplomatic, consular, commu-
nications, trade, development, security, pub-
lic diplomacy, and numerous other functions 
that Foreign Service personnel perform con-
stitute the first and most cost-effective in-
strument of the United States to protect and 
promote United States interests abroad; 
Whereas the men and women of the For-
eign Service and their families are increas-
ingly exposed to risks and danger, even in 
times of peace, and many have died in the 
service of the United States; 
Whereas employees of the Foreign Service 
work daily— 
(1) to ensure the national security of the 
United States; 
(2) to provide assistance to United States 
citizens overseas; 
(3) to preserve peace, freedom, and eco-
nomic prosperity around the world; 
(4) to promote the ideals and values of the 
United States, internationally recognized 
human rights, freedom, equal opportunities 
for women and girls, rule of law, and democ-
racy; 
(5) to promote transparency, provide accu-
rate 
information, 
and 
combat 
disinformation; 
(6) to cultivate new markets for United 
States products and services and develop new 
investment opportunities that create jobs in 
the United States and promote prosperity; 
(7) to promote economic development, re-
duce poverty, end hunger and malnutrition, 
fight disease, combat international crime 
and illegal drugs, and address environmental 
degradation; and 
(8) to provide emergency and humanitarian 
assistance to respond to crises around the 
world; 
Whereas, in response to the unprecedented 
global COVID–19 pandemic, all of the foreign 
affairs agencies of the United States have 
worked tirelessly to support the people of 
the United States, often placing their own 
safety and well-being at risk; 
Whereas the foreign affairs agencies and 
the American Foreign Service Association 
have observed Foreign Service Day in May 
for many years; and 
Whereas it is both appropriate and just for 
the United States as a whole to recognize the 
dedication of the men and women of the For-
eign Service and to honor the members of 
the Foreign Service who have given their 
lives in the loyal pursuit of their duties and 
responsibilities representing the interests of 
the United States and of its citizens: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the men and women who have 
served, or are presently serving, in the For-
eign Service of the United States for their 
dedicated and important service to the 
United States; 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
to reflect on the service and sacrifice of past, 
present, and future employees of the Foreign 
Service of the United States, wherever they 
serve, with appropriate ceremonies and ac-
tivities; and 
(3) designates May 7, 2021, as ‘‘United 
States Foreign Service Day’’ to commemo-
rate the 97th anniversary of the Foreign 
Service of the United States.

Mr. YOUNG (for himself and Mr. 
BRAUN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 203 
Whereas, on April 15, 2021, a mass shooting

FedEx Ground Plainfield Operations Center; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
mourn the 8 innocent lives lost in that un-
thinkable tragedy: Matthew Alexander, Sa-
maria Blackwell, Amarjeet Kaur Johal, 
Jasvinder Kaur, Amarjit Sekhon, Jaswinder 
Singh, Karli Smith, and John Weisert; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
express gratitude for the heroic actions of

ropolitan Police Department, who coura-
geously responded to the attack and saved 
countless lives; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
express appreciation and gratitude for all of

unteers who cared for the injured; 
Whereas the people of the United States

recover; 
Whereas the entire Indianapolis commu-

tack and stand in solidarity with those af-
fected by this senseless tragedy: Now, there-
fore, be it

S2371 
April 29, 2021 
concurrent resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation: 
S. CON. RES. 9 
Whereas the United States enjoys broad-
casting and sound recording industries that 
are the envy of the world due to the sym-
biotic relationship that has existed among 
these industries for many decades; 
Whereas, for nearly a century, Congress 
has rejected repeated calls by the recording 
industry to impose a performance fee on 
local radio stations for simply playing music 
on the radio, as such a fee would upset the 
mutually beneficial relationship between 
local radio and the recording industry; 
Whereas local radio stations provide free 
publicity and promotion to the recording in-
dustry and performers of music in the form 
of radio airplay, interviews with performers, 
introduction of new performers, concert pro-
motions, and publicity that promotes the 
sale of music, concert tickets, ring tones, 
music videos, and associated merchandise; 
Whereas committees in the Senate and the 
House of Representatives have previously re-
ported that ‘‘the sale of many sound record-
ings and the careers of many performers 
have benefitted considerably from airplay 
and other promotional activities provided by 
both 
noncommercial 
and 
advertiser-sup-
ported, free over-the-air broadcasting’’; 
Whereas local radio broadcasters provide 
tens of thousands of hours of essential local 
news and weather information during times 
of national emergencies and natural disas-
ters, as well as public affairs programming, 
sports, and hundreds of millions of dollars 
worth of time for public service announce-
ments and local fund raising efforts for wor-
thy charitable causes, all of which are jeop-
ardized if local radio stations are forced to 
divert revenues to pay for a new performance 
fee; 
Whereas there are many thousands of local 
radio stations that will suffer severe eco-
nomic hardship if any new performance fee is 
imposed, as will many other small businesses 
that play music, including bars, restaurants, 
retail establishments, sports and other en-
tertainment venues, shopping centers, and 
transportation facilities; and 
Whereas the hardship that would result 
from a new performance fee would hurt busi-
nesses in the United States and ultimately 
the consumers in the United States who rely 
on local radio for news, weather, and enter-
tainment, and such a performance fee is not 
justified when the current system has pro-
duced the most prolific and innovative 
broadcasting, music, and sound recording in-
dustries in the world: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress should 
not impose any new performance fee, tax, 
royalty, or other charge— 
(1) relating to the public performance of 
sound recordings on a local radio station for 
broadcasting sound recordings over the air; 
or 
(2) on any business for the public perform-
ance of sound recordings on a local radio sta-
tion broadcast over the air.

There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate

S. 321 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ ‘Six Triple 
Eight’ Congressional Gold Medal Act of 
2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt signed into law legislation that es-
tablished the Women’s Army Corps (referred 
to in this section as the ‘‘WAC’’) as a compo-
nent in the Army. The WAC was converted 
from the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘WAAC’’), 
which had been created in 1942 without offi-
cial military status. First Lady Eleanor Roo-
sevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune, the found-
er of the National Council of Negro Women, 
advocated for the admittance of African- 
American women into the newly formed 
WAC to serve as officers and enlisted per-
sonnel. 
(2) Dubbed ‘‘10 percenters’’, the recruit-
ment of African-American women to the 
WAAC was limited to 10 percent of the popu-
lation of the WAAC to match the proportion 
of African-Americans in the national popu-
lation. Despite an Executive order issued by 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 ban-
ning racial discrimination in civilian defense 
industries, the Armed Forces remained seg-
regated. Enlisted women served in seg-
regated units, participated in segregated 
training, lived in separate quarters, ate at 
separate tables in mess halls, and used seg-
regated recreational facilities. Officers re-
ceived their officer candidate training in in-
tegrated units but lived under segregated 
conditions. Specialist and technical training 
schools were integrated in 1943. During 
World War II, a total of 6,520 African-Amer-
ican women served in the WAAC and the 
WAC. 
(3) After several units of White women 
were sent to serve in the European Theater 
of Operations (referred to in this section as 
the ‘‘ETO’’) during World War II, African- 
American organizations advocated for the 
War Department to extend the opportunity 
to serve overseas to African-American WAC 
units. 
(4) In November 1944, the War Department 
approved sending African-American women 
to serve in Europe. A battalion of all Afri-
can-American women drawn from the WAC, 
the Army Service Forces, and the Army Air 
Forces was created and designated as the 
6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion 
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘6888th’’), 
which 
was 
nicknamed 
the 
‘‘Six 
Triple 
Eight’’. 
(5) Army officials reported a shortage of 
qualified postal officers within the ETO, 
which resulted in a backlog of undelivered 
mail. As Allied forces drove across Europe, 
the 
ever-changing 
locations 
of 
servicemembers hampered the delivery of 
mail 
to 
those 
servicemembers. 
Because 
7,000,000 civilians and military personnel 
from the United States served in the ETO, 
many of those individuals had identical 
names. For example, 7,500 such individuals 
were named Robert Smith. One general pre-
dicted that the backlog in Birmingham, Eng-
land, would take 6 months to process and the 
lack of reliable mail service was hurting mo-
rale. 
(6) In February 1945, the 6888th arrived in 
Birmingham. Upon their arrival, the 6888th 
found warehouses filled with millions of 
pieces of mail intended for members of the 
Armed Forces, United States Government 
personnel, and Red Cross workers serving in 
the ETO. 
(7) The 6888th created effective processes 
and filing systems to track individual 
servicemembers, organize ‘‘undeliverable’’ 
mail, determine the intended recipient for 
insufficiently addressed mail, and handle 
mail addressed to servicemembers who had 
died. Adhering to their motto of ‘‘No mail, 
low morale’’, the women processed an aver-
age of 65,000 pieces of mail per shift and 
cleared the 6-month backlog of mail within 3 
months. 
(8) The 6888th traveled to Rouen, France, in 
May 1945 and worked through a separate 
backlog of undelivered mail dating back as 
far as 3 years. 
(9) At the completion of their mission, the 
unit returned to the United States. The 
6888th was discontinued on March 9, 1946, at 
Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. 
(10) The accomplishments of the 6888th in 
Europe 
encouraged 
the 
General 
Board, 
United States Forces, European Theater of 
Operations to adopt the following premise in 
their study of the WAC issued in December 
1945: ‘‘[T]he national security program is the 
joint responsibility of all Americans irre-
spective of color or sex’’ and ‘‘the continued 
use of colored, along with white, female mili-
tary personnel is required in such strength 
as is proportionately appropriate to the rel-
ative population distribution between col-
ored and white races’’. 
(11) With the exception of smaller units of 
African-American nurses who served in Afri-
ca, Australia, and England, the 6888th was 
the only African-American Women’s Army 
Corps unit to serve overseas during World 
War II. 
(12) The members of the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ 
received the European African Middle East-
ern Campaign Medal, the Women’s Army 
Corps Service Medal, and the World War II 
Victory Medal for their service. 
(13) In 2019, the Army awarded the 6888th 
the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make
