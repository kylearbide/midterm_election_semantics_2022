DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

PRAYER 
Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, Chaplain, 
U.S. Navy (retired), Washington, D.C., 
offered the following prayer: 
Almighty 
God, 
we 
pray, 
reflect, 
meditate in different ways, but historic 
cherished words become shared dreams. 
Elmer Davis wrote: ‘‘This Nation 
shall be the land of the free only so 
long as it is the home of the brave.’’ 
But not all are yet truly free, and 
many not so brave. 
Military heroes risk their lives, but 
many others lack sufficient courage to 
speak truth to power, to champion 
truth over position or career. 
‘‘Liberty and justice for all,’’ we 
pledge, ‘‘Proclaim liberty throughout 
the land’’ is emblazoned on our bell. 
As war approached, FDR affirmed 
‘‘freedom from want’’ and ‘‘freedom 
from fear’’ as freedoms more like 
dreams of better times. 
The land of the free if the home of 
the brave—with leaders strong and of 
good courage who still can say ‘‘I have 
a dream.’’ Diversity our strength, 
equality our goal, may we strive for, 
move toward, liberty and justice for us 
all. 
And may we say ‘‘Amen.’’ 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 2 of House Resolution 
1289, the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

E831 
August 9, 2022 
IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT 
OF DR. THOMAS J. CATHEY 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the leadership, ministry, and 
community impact of Dr. Thomas J. Cathey of 
the Association of Christian Schools Inter-
national (ACSI) in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
Tom Cathey has dedicated his entire life to 
Christian education and, for the past 14 years, 
did so through his leadership roles at ACSI, 
from which he retired in August 2022. 
Tom Cathey has left an indelible mark on 
the Christian School movement. He has 
worked with every ACSI President in some ca-
pacity, and each has considered it a privilege 
to call him a colleague and friend. Through his 
leadership, ACSI’s Legal Legislative Depart-
ment has moved to a position of preeminence 
as a major membership value among the 
many 
services 
ACSI offers its member 
schools. He helped expand the department, 
created new legal benefits for schools, and 
became a well-loved mentor to his team. Tom 
is recognized nationally as an advocate for 
freedom in education and school choice. 
Through his work, he has provided countless 
Christian schools with valuable guidance on 
legal and policy issues in our culture when it 
is sorely needed. 
Tom was also part of a significant reorga-
nization of the ACSI board of directors and 
subsequently transformed annual visits to 
Washington, D.C., by a board subcommittee 
on legislative issues into what is now ACSI’s 
annual national Public Policy & Advocacy 
Summit. In addition, Tom oversaw ACSI’s cre-
ation of a scholarship granting organization in 
states with tax credit scholarship programs 
that benefit low- and moderate-income fami-
lies. Locally, he established the Colorado As-
sociation of Private Schools, a recognized 
state chapter of the Council for American Pri-
vate Education, and served as its director from 
2017 to 2022. 
Tom Cathey is a godly man who has en-
riched the Christian education movement 
through his faithful service and the wisdom he 
has imparted to his fellow leaders in Christian 
education. In short, Tom is one of those rare 
people for whom it is authentically true to say 
his accomplishments are too many to mention. 
As Tom embarks on a well-earned retirement, 
it is my honor to recognize him for his positive 
and lasting impact in Colorado’s Fifth Con-
gressional District and worldwide through his 
valuable service to Christian education at 
ACSI and beyond. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE AFGHAN 
ADJUSTMENT ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Afghan Adjustment Act. This 
legislation would establish a pathway to per-
manent legal status for newly arrived Afghans 
displaced at the end of the 20-year U.S. mis-
sion in Afghanistan. 
Without this legislation, the tens of thou-
sands of Afghans who were admitted to the 
United States under temporary humanitarian 
parole, including those who supported the 
U.S. mission in Afghanistan during the past 20 
years, face tremendous legal uncertainty. 
These Afghans can only pursue permanent 
legal status in the United States through the 
asylum system or, for those who are eligible, 
the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) pro-
gram. Both paths have substantial backlogs, 
long processing times, and logistical obstacles 
for these individuals. 
I first became involved in the cause of Af-
ghan allies nearly 15 years ago after being 
contacted by a social studies class from Port-
land’s Lincoln High School. Those discussions 
prompted me to work with former Senators 
John McCain and Ted Kennedy to create the 
Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) 
programs. Ever since, I have continued to 
work to strengthen these critical programs and 
provide a permanent, safe outcome for the 
brave men and women who risked their lives 
to help the United States. 
Congress must keep our commitment to 
provide safe, legal refuge to the those who 
willingly put their lives on the line to support 
U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Following pre-
vious wartime evacuations and humanitarian 
crises, including the Vietnam War and the rise 
of Castro in Cuba, Congress has provided a 
legal adjustment process for those evacuated 
to the United States and should do so once 
again, without delay. 
I look forward to working with my co-leads, 
Representatives PETER MEIJER, JERRY NAD-
LER, 
ADAM
KINZINGER, 
ZOE
LOFGREN, 
MARIANNETTE
MILLER-MEEKS, JASON
CROW, 
FRED UPTON, and SCOTT PETERS in the House 
and Senators AMY KLOBUCHAR, LINDSEY GRA-
HAM, CHRIS
COONS, ROY
BLUNT, RICHARD 
BLUMENTHAL, and LISA MURKOWSKI in the Sen-
ate to enact this legislation and finally estab-
lish a path forward for Afghans admitted to the 
United States on humanitarian status. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DANIEL L. STEIDLE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Pacifica Police Chief Daniel L. Steidle 
for his more than three decades of law en-
forcement service. Chief Steidle has made 
Pacifica a safer and more desirable place to 
live and visit. He never wavered in his commit-
ment to foster relationships between commu-
nity members and his department. 
Dan came to the beautiful coastal town of 
Pacifica in 1993 and climbed the ranks in the 
police department from officer to corporal to 
sergeant to captain. He was then appointed 
Interim Chief of Police for seven months and 
Chief of Police in October 2015. He has 
worked just about every assignment in the de-
partment. He has also secured $800,000 in 
grant funding for personnel and equipment 
costs. 
Before joining the Pacifica Police Depart-
ment, Dan began his law enforcement career 
in 1989 as a Reserve Police Officer for the 
City of Pinole. In 1990, he became a Deputy 
Sheriff at the Contra Costa County Sheriffs 
Department where he served for three years. 
He is a proud graduate of the POST Com-
mand College and earned his Bachelor’s De-
gree in Criminal Justice and a Master’s De-
gree in Strategic Leadership. 
During his time in Pacifica, Chief Steidle en-
joyed being part of a smaller and tight knit 
community where he could get to know resi-
dents and build trusting relationships. It is very 
common to see him visit and laugh with peo-
ple during festivals, parades, ribbon cuttings 
and city council meetings. He always goes the 
extra mile to help people. It has been my 
great honor to work with Chief Steidle during 
my tenure in Congress on issues such as 
human trafficking, gun violence prevention and 
community policing. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Chief Steidle for dedicating 
his career to public service and for protecting 
the residents of Pacifica. While I wish him the 
best for his next chapter in Texas, I have no 
doubt he will miss the small town feel of 
Pacifica, its people, and the Pacific Ocean. 
And in tum, we will miss him.

REMEMBERING LOIS ANN 
COSTARELLA 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Lois Ann Costarella, of Girard, 
who passed away on Monday, July 18, 2022. 
She was 84 years old. 
Lois was born on March 6, 1938, in Niles, 
Ohio, the daughter of Nicholas and Anna 
Marsico. Remaining in Niles during her youth, 
she would graduate as the valedictorian of her 
1956 class of Niles High School. 
Lois had worked for Woolco in Liberty 
Township for 13 years and Crishal’s Florist in 
Liberty for 16 years. She was a member of St. 
Rose Church, K of C Ladies Auxiliary, the 
United Auto Workers retirees, and enjoyed 
reading in her spare time.

IN 
COMMEMORATION 
OF 
THE 
TWENTIETH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE RAYMOND COALITION FOR 
YOUTH 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate 20 years of operation of the 
Raymond Coalition for Youth (RCFY), one of 
my state’s leaders in youth substance use pre-
vention. Since 2002, RCFY has promoted 
positive youth development to reduce the risk 
of substance abuse and other risky behaviors. 
For the past 20 years, they have increased 
available substance use prevention resources 
and created impactful partnerships from the 
federal level on down. Today RCFY continues 
to address the urgent needs impacting the 
wellbeing for our children in the Granite State. 
By educating and nurturing our youth, they are 
ensuring our next generation grows up with 
the support and mentorship needed to live 
healthy fulfilling lives. 
The Raymond Coalition for Youth was 
founded in response to the higher-than-state- 
average levels of substance misuse in the 
Town of Raymond. The University of New 
Hampshire kickstarted the data collection, 
community planning, and information sharing 
that culminated in this non-profit’s eventual 
formation. Now, for the first time in 20 years, 
the Town of Raymond reported lower sub-
stance misuse than the State of New Hamp-
shire average. In response to New Hamp-
shire’s addiction crisis, RCFY has proved an 
adamant reminder on the power of community 
in mitigating the harms of substance abuse 
and empowering our youth to lead healthy 
lives. Through student engagement, edu-
cation, and advocacy RCFY has become a re-
spected leader in the prevention space. 
The Raymond Coalition for Youth is rep-
resentative of the community’s multi-pronged 
approach that must encompass all levels of 
government in keeping our neighborhoods 
safe. I am honored to issue sincere congratu-
lations for the efforts of the dedicated staff and 
students involved in this prevention work. I am 
proud to represent the Raymond Coalition for 
Youth as today’s changemakers in New 
Hampshire’s First Congressional District. 
RECOGNIZING ZACK GOLDITCH 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and honor Zack Golditch, a survivor 
of the Aurora Theater Shooting, who now finds 
purpose in serving our community as a fire-
fighter for South Metro Fire Department. 
A 17-year-old high school football player in 
Aurora, with his sights set on the NFL, Zack 
spent his evening on July 20, 2012, as many 
other young people did: at a midnight showing 
of The Dark Knight Rises. What began as a 
night with friends turned deadly as a gunman 
open fired in an adjacent theater to the one 
Zack was in, killing 12 and wounding 70. How-
ever, the injuries were not confined to Theater 
9, as a bullet traveled through the wall into 
Theater 8 and struck him in the neck. 
Zack was forced to grow up too soon that 
day—his perspective on life changed forever 
as a night out with friends was almost his last. 
Recognizing the unpredictability of life, he be-
lieves that life isn’t just about seizing the op-
portunities presented to him, but to slow down 
and enjoy them. Zack went on to play college 
football at Colorado State University, before 
fulfilling his childhood dream of being drafted 
into the NFL in 2018. 
After two years in the NFL, Zack returned 
home to Colorado where he now serves our 
community as a firefighter for South Metro Fire 
and Rescue in the Denver Metro area. Along-
side his work at South Metro, Zack is involved 
in efforts to support victims of the theater 
shooting by lending his name to the Zack 
Golditch Opportunity Scholarships, established 
by the 7/20 Foundation, and managed by the 
Aurora Public Schools (APS) Foundation, to 
help APS students attend college. 
Zack is a shining example of turning pain 
into purpose. He read a quote once that reso-
nated with him: ‘‘If you’re not inspired by your 
own story, then maybe you need to start writ-
ing and there’s something you need to start 
doing.’’ So Zack became a first responder— 
fully prepared to respond to the next tragedy, 
just like those that saved him did on that night 
ten years ago. 
Out of tragedy and unspeakable darkness, 
there are always heroes who rise up and an-
swer the call to service. I can think of no bet-
ter example than Zack, who, despite being 
haunted daily by the memories of July 20th, 
shows up to work every day aiming to be bet-
ter than the day before. 
I am honored to recognize Zack for his dedi-
cation and commitment in service to making 
our community a better place to call home. I 
thank him for continuing to serve with grati-
tude, empathy, and a smile—all while inspiring 
us to be better versions of ourselves.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
IN-
CREASED 
TRANSPARENCY 
IN 
501(C)(4) ORGANIZATIONS ACT OF 
2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce 
the 
Increased 
Transparency 
in 
501(c)(4) Organizations Act of 2022. This bill 
would require the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) to make publicly available the forms or-
ganizations that self-declare under Section 
501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 
file with the IRS. Americans have the right to 
know which organizations are operating under 
this section of the IRC. 
To be eligible for tax-exempt status under 
501(c)(4), organizations, often referred to as 
‘‘social welfare organizations,’’ must be ‘‘de-
voted exclusively to charitable, educational, or 
recreational purposes.’’ They can apply for 
50l(c)(4) status, or they can self-declare. Pre-
viously, organizations seeking to self-declare 
were not required to notify the IRS of their ex-
istence. In 2015, however, the Protecting 
Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH 
Act), which required an organization seeking 
to self-declare to file a notice with the IRS, 
was enacted into law. The PATH Act did not, 
however, make the filed notices, Form 8976, 
subject to public disclosure. 
The IRS has opined that Form 8976 cannot 
be made available under the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act or other disclosure laws. This opin-
ion creates a discrepancy between those or-
ganizations for which the IRS must make pub-
licly 
available 
information—all 
Section 
501(c)(3) organizations and 501(c)(4) organi-
zations that applied for that status—and self- 
declared 501(c)(4) organizations. This discrep-
ancy appears to have been inadvertently cre-
ated by the PATH Act. 
My bill would fix this discrepancy by requir-
ing the IRS to publicly disclose any filed Form 
8976 upon request, thus allowing the public to 
know which organizations operate under 
501(c)(4), as they do with organizations that 
operate under 501(c)(3). In the aftermath of 
the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, 
which allows unlimited expenditures in political 
campaigns by these ‘‘social welfare’’ organiza-
tions, greater transparency is needed. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF THE 
LIFE OF THOMAS M. BROWN 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I along with 
Congresswoman MARCY KAPTUR rise today to 
recognize and remember the life of a dedi-
cated educator and public servant. Thomas M. 
Brown, former mayor of Port Clinton, Ohio, 
who passed away at his residence surrounded 
by his loved ones on July 10, 2022. At the age 
of eighty-two, Tom lived a long, fulfilling life as 
a career educator and committed community 
leader. 
Tom was born on June 25, 1940 in Pom-
eroy, Ohio to Virgil and Nellie Brown. After 
graduating in 1958 from Pomeroy High 
School, he attended the University of Rio 
Grande, studying education. While attending 
Rio Grande, Tom met his wife, Helen Hurst, 
and they were married on June 16, 1962. Tom 
and Helen were married for sixty years and 
had a daughter and son: Kimberly Brown and 
Colonel Michael Brown. 
Tom began his educational career at Plain 
Local Schools in Canton, Ohio as an elemen-
tary school teacher and transferred to Port

Clinton City Schools in 1966. During his twen-
ty-five-year career in education, Tom served 
as a teacher, administrator, and coach. He 
would go on to earn a Master of Education 
from the University of Toledo and a Doctorate 
in Public Service from his alma mater, the Uni-
versity of Rio Grande. 
In 1992, Tom retired from Port Clinton City 
Schools and began a new career in public 
service. He was a senior district representative 
for Congressman Paul Gillmor, and during that 
same time, also served as the President of the 
Port Clinton City Council. Tom left Congress-
man Gillmor’s office after being elected Mayor 
of Port Clinton in 1995, a position he would 
hold for twelve years. 
Tom always believed in service before self. 
During his life, he served as a Member of the 
Mayors Association of Ohio, Trustee to the Ot-
tawa County Community Improvement Cor-
poration, Chairman of the Economic Restruc-
turing Committee of the Port Clinton Chamber 
of Commerce, and on the advisory boards for 
The Ohio State University, Bowling Green 
State University, and University of Toledo. 
In his community, Tom served as president 
for the Port Clinton Lions Club, Rotary Club, 
Education Association, and Friends of Camp 
Perry. He also served his community through 
involvement in a number of local nonprofits. 
He was an active member of the Elks Club; 
Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, 32 Degree; 
Oliver Hazard Perry Masonic Lodge 341; 
Shriner Zenobia; and Dads Club of Veterans 
of Foreign Wars Post 2480. 
Madam Speaker, we ask our colleagues to 
join us in paying special tribute to the life of 
Thomas Brown. On behalf of the people of 
Northwest Ohio, we recognize the devotion 
and compassion that Tom had for his family, 
students, and community.

RECOGNIZING MICHAEL BROWN 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor an outstanding public servant, 
Michael Brown. Mike has spent much of the 
last decade dedicated to highlighting the re-
surgence of a technology race in the era of 
great power competition. His actions have 
made him a standout in the industry and en-
ables our security. 
Mike draws from the idea that the entrepre-
neurial American spirit is what has led our na-
tion to technological leadership. As a Presi-
dential Innovation Fellow, Mike was one of the 
first in the national security space to take a 
hard look at the illegal technology transfer in-
stigated by adversarial actors around the 
world. Mike co-authored a report that evalu-
ated adversarial investments in emerging tech-
nology to access the crown jewels of U.S. in-
novation. This report not only highlights the 
threats posed to the U.S. military’s supply 
chains, cybersecurity, and our nation’s techno-
logical edge, but it also provided the intellec-
tual underpinnings for the Foreign Investment 
Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) of 
2018. 
Further, as the Director of the Defense Inno-
vation Unit, Mike led a major effort to counter 
adversarial technology transfer. The National 
Security Innovation Capital (NSIC) initiative is 
a new U.S. Department of Defense program 
charged with addressing the shortfall of private 
investment from trusted sources in technology 
startups developing dual-use hardware tech-
nologies—those which have both commercial 
and military applications. I was proud to work 
with Mike on this effort to reduce technical risk 
while attracting trusted private investments 
that might have otherwise sat on the sidelines. 
As Mike returns to private life, it is my honor 
to recognize him for his contributions to na-
tional security. I invite all members of this 
body to join me in commending his spirit of 
service and thanking him for his many years 
and acts as a public servant protecting our na-
tion.

IN RECOGNITION OF STEPHANIE 
SHERRODD 
HON. MELANIE A. STANSBURY 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Stephanie Sherrodd on 
her recent selection to the Board of Directors 
of the National Association of Federally-In-
sured Credit Unions (NAFCU) while serving 
employees of Sandia National Laboratories in 
New Mexico’s First Congressional District. 
Stephanie has an impressive 24 years of 
experience in the credit union industry, rising 
from her work as a marketing intern to the 
highest levels of credit unions. She has pre-
viously served as President/CEO for Texas 
Dow Employees Credit Union (TDECU) from 
2012 to 2021, helping to grow the organization 
to assets of over $4 billion with 345,000 mem-
bers. Prior to being named CEO at Texas 
Dow Employees Credit Union Stephanie 
served as Vice President of Retail Delivery, 
Vice President of Diversified Services and Ex-
ecutive Vice President and Chief Operating 
Officer. Stephanie is also a proud graduate of 
her home state’s University of Wyoming, re-
ceiving her Bachelor of Science in Marketing 
as well as an MBA. 
Stephanie is currently serving as the Presi-
dent and CEO of Sandia Laboratory Federal 
Credit Union. She was recently named to the 
Credit Union Executive Society Hall of Fame 
and has also served as a board member of 
the Texas Bowl, National Association of Credit 
Union Service Organizations, University of 
Houston Board of Visitors, and as a member 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Com-
munity Depository Institution Advisory Council. 
She has been recognized by Texas Diversity 
Magazine with the Houston Power 50 Award 
and was named a Greater Houston Women’s 
Chamber Breakthrough Woman. 
Stephanie has been married to her husband 
Kevin for 28 years and is a mom to two sons, 
a Texas A&M Aggie, and a high school senior. 
She is an active cyclist, runner and outdoor 
enthusiast as well as a devoted friend who 
leads with her core values of courage and 
grace. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating Stephanie Sherrodd and wishing her the 
best of luck in her new role on the NAFCU 
Board of Directors. I look forward to working 
with her in this regard. 
IN HONOR OF THE LEADERSHIP OF 
DICK EASTMAN 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the leadership of Dick 
Eastman at Every Home for Christ in Colorado 
Springs, Colorado. With offices in over 150 
nations, Every Home is a global ministry com-
mitted to reaching everyone with the gospel. 
Dick has faithfully served at Every Home for 
over 40 years, 34 of them as the ministry’s 
international president. During those years, 
Every Home opened more than 100 new min-
istry offices worldwide, saw the gospel reach 
more than two billion homes globally, and 
planted at least 400,000 new believer fellow-
ships called Christ Groups. 
In his role with Every Home, Dick has trav-
eled more than 100 times around the world. 
Under his leadership, the ministry established 
its headquarters, The Jericho Center, in Colo-
rado Springs, which has become a hub of 
prayer for the nations and ministry partner-
ships in our community. Dick has labored tire-
lessly to develop partnerships that span de-
nominations, bringing together the Church in 
the United States and around the world for the 
sake of the gospel. 
Dick has always been passionate about 
prayer and has developed numerous practical 
programs, resources, and teachings to call the 
world to worship. His Change the World 
School of Prayer is a multi-part seminar that 
has trained more than two million Christians in 
120 nations on the power of prayer. 
In addition to his leadership with Every 
Home, Dick is the author of numerous books 
on prayer and evangelism. He also serves as 
a founding member and president of Amer-
ica’s National Prayer Committee. Several 
former presidents have invited Mr. Eastman to 
the Oval Office for prayer, advice, and fellow-
ship. 
Dick will continue serving the Every Home 
ministry as its chief prayer officer, providing 
spiritual and practical support for the organiza-
tion as it moves into the future. He is truly a 
spiritual father in the Pikes Peak region, our 
Nation, and the world. 
As Dick transitions into his new role with 
Every Home, it is my privilege to honor and 
thank him for his faithful service in Colorado 
Springs and across the globe.

distinguished Air Assault Badge. He was de-
ployed to the Middle East and served in two 
border missions. 
Following his honorable discharge after five 
years in the Army, Officer Shahnavaz an-
swered the call to service once again and en-
rolled in the Indiana Law Enforcement Acad-
emy, joining the Elwood Police Department in 
August 2021. After less than a year in the 
force, Officer Shahnavaz was killed in the line 
of duty on July 31, 2022, making the ultimate 
sacrifice for his community after a career dedi-
cated to serving others. 
The men and women of Indiana’s 5th Con-
gressional District mourn Officer Shahnavaz’s 
tragic and untimely loss. As someone who ex-
emplified selfless duty to community and 
country, he leaves a legacy and example wor-
thy of our highest admiration. Officer Noah 
Jacob Shahnavaz is a true hero. He will never 
be forgotten.

IN HONOR OF ESCALON’S ONE 
HUNDREDTH PARK FETE 
HON. JOSH HARDER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the one hundredth an-
niversary of Escalon, California’s Park Fete. 
The Park Fete is a remarkable, multi-day cele-
bration that brings the community together and 
further forges the bonds that are at the heart 
of Escalon’s character. 
What began in 1922 as a lawn party to cele-
brate and raise funds for the town’s Main 
Street Park has blossomed into an annual 
event that residents look forward to all year 
long. Produced from a community of just 
7,000 people, the Park Fete includes carnival 
rides, live entertainment, food booths, pag-
eants, and a 10k run among numerous other 
events. It is a wonderful occasion wherein 
neighbors socialize, children enjoy the bliss of 
summer vacation, and the whole town feels a 
sense of unity. 
More than just a celebration, the Park Fete 
is a direct reflection of Escalon and its resi-
dents. An idyllic small town with safe streets, 
superb schools, and a welcoming environ-
ment, Escalon’s ethos has been cultivated 
through generations of community service. 
The sentiment that reverberates throughout 
the town can best be summed by Escalon’s 
mission statement: ‘‘Taking pride in our com-
munity through quality service.’’ Nowhere else 
is this pride more profoundly depicted than 
through the Park Fete, which is only made 
possible by generous donations from local 
business leaders, countless volunteers, and 
organizers who plan months in advance. 
It is precisely events like the Park Fete that 
truly represent the best in us. I am immensely 
proud of the people of Escalon who, through 
their hard work, selflessness, and commitment 
to one another, have kept the Park Fete alive 
and well for a century.

IN HONOR OF REPRESENTATIVE 
JACKIE WALORSKI 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
as the Dean of the Indiana Delegation to 
honor 
the 
late 
Congresswoman 
Jackie 
Walorski who represented Indiana’s 2nd con-
gressional district from 2012 until her recent 
passing on August 3, 2022. 
Jackie was a lifelong Hoosier who was born 
in South Bend, within the district she would 
come to represent in Congress. Her career 
was one of service, from the St. Joseph Coun-
ty Humane Society where she served as Ex-
ecutive Director, to missionary work in Roma-
nia that resulted in the creation of a foundation 
providing food and medical supplies. Jackie’s 
commitment to service was recognized by her 
fellow Hoosiers, who elected her to the Indi-
ana General Assembly as State Representa-
tive in 2004 for three terms. In 2012, she was 
elected by the 2nd congressional district to the 
U.S. House of Representatives where she was 
serving her fifth term. 
Her integrity and commitment to fairness 
were recognized by her colleagues when she 
was selected to serve as the Ranking Member 
of the House Committee on Ethics, tasked 
with administering standards of conduct for the 
House. She was committed to leading her col-
leagues to the highest standards of trans-
parency, accountability, and ethical conduct. 
Her colleagues will also remember Rep-
resentatives Walorski’s passion for hunger 
issues and her efforts as co-chair of the Hun-
ger Caucus. The daughter of an Air Force vet-
eran, she also advocated for servicemembers 
and veterans, helping to enact the Veterans 
Mobility Safety Act of 2016 and extending 
whistleblower protections to victims of military 
sexual assault within the FY2014 National De-
fense Authorization Act. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring one of our own. Hoosiers mourn the 
loss of a leader known for her dedicated pub-
lic service and strong work ethic. We also rec-
ognize the service of her two dedicated staff-
ers, Emma Thomson and Zach Potts, who 
perished in the car accident with Jackie. We 
stand together to celebrate their generous 
spirits and their lives of public service. I also 
pray that these remembrances and tributes 
are a balm to their families as they deal with 
this tragic loss, today and in the days ahead.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE MOTOWN 
MUSEUM 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 9, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I want to 
recognize the Motown Museum, located in De-
troit in Michigan’s 13th District Strong as they 
celebrate their grand reopening. 
The Motown Museum is an important cul-
tural institution that has local and nationwide 
significance. The museum’s leadership and 
volunteers have dedicated themselves to pre-
serving the legacy of Motown’s indelible and 
profound impact on our country’s music and 
popular culture. 
Founded in 1985 by Esther Gordy Edwards, 
the museum seeks to capture the magic of the 
1960s-era Motown’s ‘‘voice of young America’’ 
by preserving the artifacts of Motown Records’ 
early days. Producer Gordy Berry was the 
mastermind behind Motown Records, bringing 
to the mainstream its characteristic soulful and 
pop sound. A Blackowned label, Motown 
made history in popularizing and integrating its 
distinctive sound. 
Please join me in celebrating Detroit’s very 
own Motown Museum as they reopen their 
newly expanded facility.
