f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
On this first day of the week, O Lord, 
the world looks a little different. With 
eyes of renewed faith we see the proof 
of creation with which You have 
blessed us, in the emergence of leaves 
from the trees and the multitude of 
flowers from the darkness of winter. 
Awaken us to the promise of new life 
You offer us, where joy emerges from 
the depths of our souls and hope from 
the bleakness around us. May we re-
joice in Your creative renewal within 
us and delight in the signs of Your 
presence among us. 
We pray, then, as we venture into 
this week and dare to work toward a 
peaceful future, that You will answer 
even before we speak, that You will 
hear us even before we finish praying. 
Make us the instruments of Your per-
fect will. Direct our passions to bring-
ing the wolf and the lamb together, and 
our efforts to encouraging the lion to 
eat straw with the ox. 
So may we dedicate ourselves neither 
to harm nor destroy this Your holy cre-
ation. 
By Your grace we pray in Your name. 
Amen.

April 18, 2022 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE 
AND MEMORY OF RENEE SPAAR 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor the life of 
Ms. Renee Spaar and recognize her for the 
tremendous work achieved in the Odessa 
community. Renee loved her community and 
would stop at nothing to help the people within 
it. She truly was an amazing person to work 
with and a pioneer in education for the Odes-
sa School District and school districts through-
out Lafayette County, Missouri. 
Her career began after graduating from 
Southwest Missouri State University in 1982 at 
The Odessan, where she would go on to de-
velop the Newspapers in Education program. 
Through this program Renee was able to link 
real-world experiences to the classroom, pro-
mote lifelong learning, and develop reading 
habits by advancing the use of a newspaper 
in the classroom to promote literacy for kids 
across the Odessa area. Additionally, she was 
one of the founding members of the Odessa 
Outreach, an organization created to help 
serve and fund local non-profits in the area 
who need assistance. Renee’s life will be re-
membered for her passion for education and 
outstanding work for everyone in her city. She 
always found a way to overcome any difficul-
ties she faced in her long, dedicated career to 
service, and in doing so remained positive no 
matter what. 
Renee was loved by many and in return 
loved all that she encountered. She was de-
scribed by her peers as always having a bright 
smile on her face, a joke to tell, and uplifting 
for those who needed it. She was an enjoy-
able person to be around and would light up 
every room she walked into. We should all 
strive to be as happy, loving, and gracious as 
Renee was in her admirable 61 years of living. 
She will be deeply missed, but her long-lasting 
impact and legacy will live on for years to 
come. I would like to offer my condolences to 
all that knew Renee and her loving family and 
remember her for the outstanding work she 
did for the Odessa community. May her mem-
ory be a blessing.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE INAU-
GURATION OF BAY PATH UNI-
VERSITY PRESIDENT SANDRA J. 
DORAN 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to congratulate Sandra 
Doran on being inaugurated as the sixth presi-
dent of Bay Path University in Longmeadow, 
Massachusetts. As Bay Path marks their 
125th anniversary, I could not think of a more 
appropriate platform to celebrate the inaugura-
tion of President Doran. 
Over the past 18 years, President Doran’s 
experience in academics has culminated in 
her becoming a leader in higher education. 
Most recently, President Doran served as 
President of Salem Academy and College in 
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the nation’s 
oldest women’s college. In just two years, 
President Doran helped develop and imple-
ment a plan to bring financial stability to 
Salem College, while transforming their aca-
demic programs to educate future generations 
of female leaders. Prior to beginning her aca-
demic career in 2004, President Doran worked 
in the private sector for 18 years, building a 
unique skillset that will serve her well in her 
new position at Bay Path. 
In 1897, Bay Path University was founded 
upon the ideals of providing career-focused 
educational programs and providing students 
with the resources needed to affect real 
change in their communities. Offering 71 all- 
women undergraduate programs, and 33 co- 
educational graduate programs, Bay Path 
prides itself on empowering its diverse student 
body of more than 3,000 students to help 
women close the wage gap and stem the 
cycle of poverty. President Doran has dem-
onstrated her commitment to these funda-
mental issues throughout her career, and that 
is why I am confident she will be a strong 
leader and outspoken advocate as Bay Path 
begins a new era in the institution’s history. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to once again 
congratulate President Doran on being inaugu-
rated as the sixth president of Bay Path Uni-
versity. Bay Path is a cherished institution in 
Massachusetts’ First District, and I wish their 
faculty, staff, student body, and new president, 
Sandra Doran, many more years of success 
and prosperity.

CIPIENT NORMA JEAN VALDEZ 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor Norma Jean Valdez. 
As Senior Management Analyst with the Los 
Alamos County Fire Department (LACFD), Ms. 
Valdez has demonstrated a deep commitment 
to public safety through her work on fire ac-
creditation. 
Our state is all too familiar with the devasta-
tion that fires can cause. Ms. Valdez’s work is 
so important for keeping New Mexicans and 
their property safe. 
Ms. Valdez’s leadership in the fire and 
emergency service is well-recognized among 
her colleagues and community. 
This leadership earned her the 2022 Center 
for Public Safety Excellence Ray Picard 
Award. 
I would also like to recognize the historic 
nature of Ms. Valdez’s selection as the first ci-
vilian, woman, Hispanic, and New Mexican to 
ever receive this prestigious award. 
Ms. Valdez’s work is commendable, and I’m 
proud to represent such a dedicated public 
servant in Congress. I join the Los Alamos 
community in congratulating her on this in-
credible accomplishment.

IN RECOGNITION OF COMMANDER 
RUSS NORRIS 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker. I rise today 
in recognition of Commander Russ Norris’s 
dedicated service to his country. Commander 
Norris served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 
more than 22 years and brought his spirit of 
service home, maintaining active participation 
and leadership with Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
Commander Norris has gone above and be-
yond the call of duty in his service to his coun-
try, as in addition to the many milestones of 
Marine Corps training, he has achieved over a 
dozen advanced certifications. These include 
completing the Defense Institute for Security 
Assistance Management’s Security Coopera-
tion course, and the Commanders Responsi-
bility Course. Amongst his many accolades, 
Russ earned the Korean Defense Service 
Medal, was selected to be a Staff Sergeant 
(E–6) and became a commissioned officer. 
Norris rose to the rank of Major and served at 
the highest echelons of the US military, before 
retiring in 2011. 
Commander Norris currently holds a B.A. in 
Government & International Studies, a mas-
ter’s degree in Operations Science and, while 
serving as Commander at the Post for Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, is pursuing his Doc-
torate. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I would like 
to thank Commander Russ Norris for his serv-
ice and wish him the best in his work toward 
the completion of his degree.

to acknowledge the unique challenges faced 
by adults with autism after the age of 21. 
The transition to adulthood is challenging for 
many young people. However, this transition 
period can be especially difficult for autistic 
young people, who often face a formidable 
challenge—the so-called ‘‘services cliff’’—as 
they age out of the school system. Federal 
support services drop off, and young adults 
with autism and their families often struggle to 
find meaningful educational and job opportuni-
ties, face challenges in obtaining essential 
support services, and experience what can 
feel like an overwhelming loss of their commu-
nity. 
In light of these pressing challenges, 
Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the im-
portant work being done to support adults with 
autism in my community. Two extraordinary 
constituents of mine, JaLynn Prince and Dr. 
Gregory A. Prince, founded the Madison 
House Autism Foundation, which works to im-
prove the health and wellbeing of autistic 
adults throughout their lifespan. The Madison 
House 
Autism 
Foundation 
is 
expanding 
choices and opportunities for adults with au-
tism through housing initiatives, employment 
partnerships, and many other innovative ef-
forts, including the Autism After 21 movement. 
Madam Speaker, we must continue working 
to achieve a more inclusive and enlightened 
society that provides equitable opportunities to 
autistic individuals of every age. This month, 
as we celebrate the contributions of so many 
adults with autism and their allies, I urge my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing April 21st 
as national ‘‘Autism After 21 Day’’.

IN HONOR OF THE 80TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FLYING TIGERS 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I wish to commemorate the 80th Anni-
versary of the Flying Tigers. Originally named 
the American Volunteer Group (AVG), the Fly-
ing Tigers were a group of American aviators 
who were recruited by China during World 
War II to fight Japanese forces in China and 
Burma from 1941 to 1942. The 100-member 
company assisted in the transport of vital sup-
plies, provided air cover for the Burma Road, 
helped protect China’s capital region, and op-
posed Japan’s invasion of China. The unit is 
credited with 297 enemy aircraft destroyed de-
spite a lack of medical support and mainte-
nance crew. Over the course of the unit’s 
service, 14 dedicated crew were killed, cap-
tured, or deemed missing in combat. 
The Flying Tigers were led by Retired U.S. 
Army Captain, Claire Lee Chennault, whose 
training enabled the utilization of high-speed 
diving and climbing techniques to exploit the 
weaknesses of the larger Japanese aircraft. 
The unit was lauded for their ability to inflict 
damage on Japan’s superior force despite the 
significant disadvantages they held. The suc-
cess achieved by the Flying Tigers on the bat-
tlefield was a morale boost for the Chinese 
and American allies at a time when the war 
appeared to be going in Japan’s favor. 
Madam Speaker, I honor the bravery of the 
Flying Tigers, and I celebrate the efforts of the 
Asian Pacific Public Affairs Association and 
the Sino-American Heritage Foundation to me-
morialize the Flying Tigers’ legacy.

THANKING 
PHARMACIES 
AND 
HEALTH 
CENTERS 
FOR 
THEIR 
ROLE 
IN 
EQUITABLE 
VACCINE 
DISTRIBUTION 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to com-
mend pharmacies and health centers for their 
efforts in distributing COVID–19 vaccines to 
underserved communities throughout Southern 
California, including in the Coachella Valley. 
In February of 2021, I called upon retail 
pharmacies, including Rite Aid, to expand the 
number of their vaccination sites located in 
high-risk, underserved communities in eastern 
Riverside County, where my district lies. 
Twelve communities in my district are defined 
by the Health Resources and Services Admin-
istration (HRSA) as Medically Underserved 
Areas, including Blythe, Hemet, San Jacinto, 
Coachella, Indio, Idyllwild/Pine Cove, Banning, 
Beaumont, and Chiriaco Summit/Desert Cen-
ter. Many of these same communities were hit 
particularly hard by the pandemic and began 
to experience disparities in vaccination rates. 
I am grateful to the businesses and organi-
zations that answered this call and stepped up 
to promote vaccine equity. Following my letter, 
several additional vaccine sites and mobile 
vaccine clinics in vulnerable and underserved 
communities were opened in my district, in-
creasing access for high-risk individuals. 
I was honored to collaborate with organiza-
tions including Rite Aid Pharmacy, Desert 
Healthcare Clinic, Eisenhower Health, and the 
Riverside University Health System on multiple 
on-the-ground mobile clinics throughout 2021. 
As an emergency medicine physician, I was 
able to directly administer vaccines to my con-
stituents, while observing the vital work that 
these groups brought to our region. Thanks to 
pharmacy organizations, health centers, sev-
eral wonderful local organizations, President 
Biden’s federal retail pharmacy program, and 
the Health Equity Task Force, we were not 
only able to bring COVID–19 vaccines to phar-
macies located in the hardest-to-reach com-
munities, but also take vaccines directly to the 
people. 
Over the last 12 months, the Coachella Val-
ley’s vaccination rate for residents 12 and over 
has risen to over 80 percent. These high vac-
cination rates have proven to be lifesaving as 
the region continues to face challenges pre-
sented by COVID–19 and its variants. I am 
grateful for the collaborative effort that played 
a critical role in addressing vaccine equity and 
am happy that my high-risk constituents now 
have much-needed access to COVID–19 vac-
cines. 
On behalf of the great people of California’s 
36th Congressional District, thank you to the 
pharmacies, health centers, health systems, 
and local organizations for your work to bring 
equitable health and vaccine access to our 
district. I look forward to continuing our shared 
work to address health disparities and protect 
underserved populations throughout commu-
nities across the nation. 
IN RECOGNITION OF RITA MCCABE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Rita McCabe’s years of serv-
ice for Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 2010, 
Rita made history as the first President of the 
John H. Hargreaves Pelham Memorial Auxil-
iary 10722. In her time with the organization, 
Rita has provided Officer Training Sessions, 
as well as earned several distinguishments, in-
cluding an Outstanding President award. 
Rita became a business owner in 2014, 
opening the first Sub Zero Nitrogen Ice Cream 
shop in Nashua, New Hampshire, and has ex-
panded the franchise to add locations in Ash-
land, 
Worchester, 
Cambridge, 
and 
Man-
chester. 
Rita’s community involvement and impact 
do not end there. She was a Girl Scout Lead-
er for 7 years, a Pastoral Council member for 
St. Patrick’s Church twice and served two 
terms as Director-at-large for the Veteran 
Business Owners Initiative. Her commitment to 
bettering her community led Rita to provide 
unique hybrid training opportunities for officers 
at the John H. Hargreaves Pelham Memorial 
Auxiliary. Rita is a dedicated supporter of our 
troops, businesswoman and volunteer. The 
Granite State is thankful for her years of com-
mitment and service. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Rita McCabe for her continued dedica-
tion to the Auxiliary and congratulate her on 
her many well-deserved awards.

IN RECOGNITION OF METROPOLI-
TAN COMMUNITY COLLEGE’S AD-
VANCE TECHNICAL SKILLS IN-
STITUTE 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, for two 
generations now, the promise of college is one 
on which we as a nation have largely failed to 
deliver. At a time when seven of ten under-
graduate students and nine of ten Pell Grant 
recipients must take on debt simply to grad-
uate college—a debt load which averages 
$30,000 per borrower—many families have 
begun considering alternatives. However, the 
WPA is gone, and with it even rhetorical con-
cessions to the idea of full employment. More 
disappointingly evanescent is the yeoman idea 
which once accompanied manual labor. The 
artisans and mechanics of whom Jefferson 
wrote so fondly—the ideal American citizen— 
theirs has become an almost antiquarian way 
of life. The Great Emancipator once wrote, 
‘‘Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves 
much the higher consideration.’’ In this vein, 
and on behalf of Missouri’s Fifth Congres-
sional district, I rise to honor Metropolitan 
Community College’s Advanced Technical 
Skills Institute’s Early College Program. 
The Early College Program allows students 
to consider their options, rather than locking 
them into a field of study, and allows them to

earn college credit towards certificate and As-
sociates programs. The four careers which 
students can pursue through the program 
promise dignified and liberating labor, livable 
wages, a community’s respect, and autonomy. 
The pathways include HVAC, Construction 
Careers, Engineering and Technology, and 
Welding. The program delivers the institutions 
promise of bolstering participation in the 
trades and developing a skilled workforce that 
is prepared to meet the demands of the future. 
The satisfaction, the fulfilment, and the com-
pensation that comes with these trades be-
longs to the tradesperson alone. The graduate 
will carry these with them as a badge of 
honor; they will wear a proud and dignified 
smile. 
Our infrastructure crumbles around us. 
Bridges fall. Housing stock sits vacant. Our 
water is unsafe to drink. Missouri’s infrastruc-
ture was recently graded a C¥ by the White 
House. I am further ashamed to announce 
that this is one of the higher rankings in the 
nation. No state received a grade above C+. 
Great disasters—manmade disasters, bred of 
indecision and postponement, of abdication of 
responsibility—await us if we do not act. We 
must provide avenues such as this Early Col-
lege Program, training millions for the labor we 
all know is necessary. The Bipartisan Infra-
structure Law marks the largest investment in 
Americas critical infrastructure in nearly a cen-
tury and will create an estimated 2 million jobs 
per year—particularly for those with trade ex-
perience and technical skills. Those partici-
pating in MCCKC’s Early College Program will 
be leaders in the Midwest region, charged with 
the duty to not only tackle the nation’s crum-
bling infrastructure, but also in preparing for a 
greener future. Roosevelt met the Great De-
pression head on with a whole alphabet of in-
novative solutions: CCC, NYA, WPA. I believe 
this program—the MCCKC ATSI ECP, if you 
will—can serve as a model for higher edu-
cation reform across the country. 
When I consider the endless potential of this 
program, I reflect on these historical lessons. 
I think of the new opportunities. I think of the 
new future these students will build together 
with capable hands and keen minds. They will 
become sharp without becoming narrow. They 
will graduate into good, honest careers. I hope 
this hallowed body joins me in honoring Metro-
politan Community College in this tremendous 
vision, and in wishing them eternal luck in an 
uncertain future. They have my utmost con-
fidence and support.

IN RECOGNITION OF VAISAKHI 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to join with the Sikh com-
munity in celebrating Vaisakhi. 
The Sikh New Year Festival is a time for 30 
million Sikhs around the world to celebrate the 
solar new year and reflect on the rich history 
of their religion. Founded in the Punjab region 
of India by Guru Nanak in the 15th Century 
CE, Sikhism was founded upon the principles 
of living an honest and hard-working lifestyle 
while serving others and treating everyone 
equally. Despite their beliefs of good-will, 
Sikhs have been subjected to violence and 
have fought relentlessly to defend their faith, 
most notably in 1984 with Sikh genocide dur-
ing the anti-Sikh riots in India. 
In the First Congressional District of Massa-
chusetts, the City of Holyoke declared April 
14th National Sikh Day. Every year, the Sikh 
community of western Massachusetts gathers 
at Holyoke City Hall to raise the Nishan Sahib 
flag in celebration of Vaisakhi. The First Dis-
trict is fortunate to have a Sikh community that 
plays a prominent philanthropic role by giving 
back to those less fortunate. As we celebrate 
Sikh Awareness Month in the Commonwealth 
of Massachusetts, let us all embrace the Sikh 
principles of service and generosity. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to wish the 
World Sikhs Parliament and the Sikh commu-
nity a happy and prosperous Vaisakhi.

HONORING THOMAS PEEK ROZIER, 
JR. AS HE RETIRES AFTER 42 
YEARS OF DISTINGUISHED SERV-
ICE 
HON. JAKE ELLZEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Thomas Peek Rozier, Jr., as he re-
tires after 42 years of distinguished service in 
keeping the lights on for the people of Texas. 
A graduate of DeSoto High School, Tom start-
ed his career as a member of the Right-of- 
Way Crew for Texas Power & Light in 1980. 
The following year, Tom graduated from climb-
ing school and scaled his way up—both lit-
erally and figuratively—to become a senior 
lineman in 1984, which happened to be the 
year Texas Power & Light became Texas Utili-
ties Electric Company, later known as TXU 
and now Oncor. For the next 22 years, Tom 
proved to be a trusted employee of TXU, ris-
ing to the ranks of senior electrician and pa-
trolman and managing several substation 
crews. A humble kid from Greenville, Mis-
sissippi, who—in his own words—‘‘crammed 
12 years of school into 14,’’ Tom never saw 
himself reaching the heights that he did. Luck-
ily, his superiors recognized his potential and 
encouraged him to seek a position in the 
Transmission Grid Management (TGM) Divi-
sion in 2004, where he has worked ever since. 
Tom’s decades of experience as a lineman 
and patrolman have been invaluable for TGM 
and allowed him the opportunity to serve the 
very crews he dedicated so much of his life to. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of 
the 6th Congressional District and the State of 
Texas, it is an honor to recognize Tom for his 
many years of hard work and to wish him the 
best in his retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF PAUL SAN NICOLAS SHIMIZU 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 18, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Paul San 
Nicolas Shimizu. Paul was an esteemed vi-
sionary, outstanding ambassador, and true pil-
lar of our community. Our people will fondly 
remember him as a passionate leader who as-
pired to cultivate a greater quality of life for 
our island and region by forging connections 
with the rest of the world. 
As the youngest son of the late Ambrosio 
Shimizu, Paul joined his father and brothers in 
elevating their four-generation family business, 
Ambros, Inc., into a catalyst of prosperity for 
all those whose lives it touched. Contributing 
to its significant expansion, alongside in-
creased opportunities for many throughout our 
region, he brought new meaning to their com-
pany slogan, ‘‘Generations Serving Micro-
nesia.’’ In addition to having learned every as-
pect of Ambros, Inc., risen as its Corporate 
Secretary and joint owner, and spearheaded 
iconic sports and entertainment events for the 
island public, he further dedicated his work to-
ward the growth of the company’s subsidi-
aries, Marianas Pacific Distributors, Inc., 
Shimbros Inc. in Palau, Shimbros Audio, and 
American Samoa, Inc. Moreover, as appointed 
Vice Chair on the Board of Directors for the 
Guam Visitors Bureau with critical roles as 
chair for the North America, Pacific and Phil-
ippines Marketing and Sports and Events 
Committees and vice-chair of the Air Service 
Development and Japan Marketing Com-
mittee, he materially advanced Guam’s tour-
ism industry and fostered its ties to govern-
ment and community. 
Paul’s influence within our community also 
extended beyond the business sector. With a 
passion to showcase Guam’s people, talent, 
and greatness to the rest of the world, he was 
an ardent supporter of musicians. He worked 
to transform Shimbros into more than a music 
production company by facilitating music les-
sons for almost any instrument to generations 
of islanders in addition to hosting historic con-
certs for international artists such as Toto, 
Skid Row, Santana, Maxi Priest, Reggae 
Sunsplash, Mike Love & The Beach Boys 
Touring Band, and UB40. An accomplished 
Team Guam basketball gold-medalist himself, 
he also recognized the importance of creating 
spaces for our athletes to rise as fierce oppo-
nents and champions on the world stage. This 
was partly demonstrated by the guidance and 
support he offered to his nephew, Steve, in 
establishing the Marianas Open—a recognized 
Brazilian jiujitsu competition for all ages—as 
well as his consistent sponsorship of numer-
ous professional boxing matches, soccer 
leagues, and other sports organizations and 
activities. His devotion to others also material-
ized in numerous philanthropic endeavors in-
cluding involvement with the IRecycle pro-
gram, charitable giving, and other worthy 
causes. 
Paul San Nicolas Shimizu admirably em-
bodied the Ha˚fa Adai spirit and CHamoru 
value of inafa’maolek with humility and distinc-
tion. His unwavering zeal to put Guam on the 
map for our region, nation, and world to see 
continues to inspire many throughout the is-
land, and I join the People of Guam in remem-
bering and celebrating his life and legacy of 
commitment to serving community at the 
unique intersections of one’s skills, opportuni-
ties, and interests. My family and I wish to ex-
tend our hearts and prayers for Paul San 
Nicolas Shimizu, his wife, Jeni; their children, 
Toby, Carlos, Lucas, Pilar, and Diego; the rest 
of their family, and friends. He will be dearly
